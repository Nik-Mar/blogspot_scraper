{"title": "Good Morning!", "date": "Saturday, January 06, 2024", "text": "It is Saturday! It feels like Sunday! I don’t know why I get my days mixed up so but I am sure it has something to do with being retired and not really having to follow a set schedule.  This will probably only get worse the next school year when we are no longer on after school pick up duty.  Sigh.  How in the world is that going to feel?  Probably not going to feel great.  But, not to worry about that now.I watched my first movie of 2024 last night.  Nothing current, an old movie that I actually saw in the theater.  I was about 8 or so.  It was “A Summer Place” starring Troy Donahue, Sandra Dee, Arthur Kennedy, Constance Ford, Dorothy McGuire and Richard Eagen.  Back in the day there weren’t movie ratings and we very often went to the movie as a family and this was no different, it was my mom and me and my aunt and cousin.  However, rewatching last night made me wonder what in the world my mother was thinking, clearly not appropriate for an 8 year old.  She probably figured that I wouldn’t understand it and maybe, at the time, I didn’t but I do know it helped fuel my fear of doctors.And what brought about this desire to delve into old movies?  I am reading a book called “The Way We Never Were”.  It is a non fiction book discussing the phenomena of the fabulous 50’s and how the era was pretty much designed by the government to help combat the Cold War.  A little out of my realm of usual reading material but it is interesting.  So, according to this book, those fabulous 50’s were pretty much an illusion.  Well, I’ll take it.I have finished three books of my reading list so far — “Christmas Bliss” which was really the last read of 2023 but since I finished it on New Year’s Day I opted to add it to this years count — “Henry Huggins”, a children’s book popular in the year I was born and “Bright Lights, Big Christmas”, a book that was highly touted on many of the facebook reading forums so I had to give it a go and I wasn’t disappointed.  It was definitely a book to get into, light reading, great scenery, great characterization — all the things.  I have to say I have never read Mary Kay Andrews until the end of 2023 and I think she is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors.Today I am cleaning out some crafting stash.  This is one of those things that I need to get started but am dragging my feet.  So, I am going to set the timer and work for a while and call it done for the day.  I have a taker for the stuff so I need to get busy.  Ugh.  I really don’t like destashing but I need to.  So, that is it for now!  My 2024 has been very quiet so far and I am enjoying that immensely.  Have a great Saturday."},
{"title": "Henry Huggins ", "date": "Tuesday, January 02, 2024", "text": "I finished the second book of my challenge this morning, a children’s book titled “Henry Huggins” by Beverly Cleary.I chose to read a book popular in the year of my birth — 1950 — and this looked like a delightful way to start the year.It is the story of Henry Huggins and his neighborhood friends on his street called Klackitat St.  Also featured in the book is his dog Ribsy.  There was a bit of tension at the end involving Ribsy but it all worked out well.Will I read the next one in the series?  Not sure as I have a very stuffed library thanks to Kindle’s Stuff your Kindle day.  But I will definitely keep it on my list of future possibilities.It is a cold day here in the Fort — winter has definitely arrived but at least it has been clear and sunny.  I need to make a Target run today, hopefully early, and I will have Bean for awhile so we are going to clean out and straighten up my craft stash.  It actually all needs to be donated but we will see.Have a wonderful day as the world gets back to normal!"},

And no, I don’t eat black eyed peas!"},
{"title": "Trixie’s New “Thing”", "date": "Friday, December 29, 2023", "text": "Trixie is a good little dog in spite of training difficulties.  She will be five in March and she is getting more mellow.  So, we are trying some new things.She doesn’t ride well in the car, mostly jumping all over me and making the short trip to the vet seem like a 6 hour road trip.  But, her desire to go bye bye is great.  In the front seat she is a miserable thing, she won’t stay on the floor, she wants on my lap she gets too excited and drools like a basset hound.  If I put her in the back seat with her seat belt she calms right down but I have to be back there with her.That doesn’t work well if I am the one driving.  If Hubs is the one driving it feels a bit like “Driving Miss Daisy” and I am not ready to be there yet.  So, what is a doggo mom to do?CARSEAT!One of Trixie’s Christmas presents was a car seat.  I did a reasonable amount of research and since I know her well I know anything like a pillow or stuffed animal won’t make it around the block before it becomes history.  So, I needed something soft and cushy but not fluffy.I checked out Piggy Poo and Crew but decided their was a bit too basic.  So this is what I settled on —There are straps that go around the headrest and then the seat belt slips through loops (of a sort) on the front and hooks in to the regular seat belt latch.We tried it on for size.  It is a small — Trixie isn’t small — up to 25 lbs. and she is 18.8.  I was worried that she wouldn’t fit well and was pleasantly surprised to discover that she fits perfectly.  I took it out of the box, it looks sturdy, and let her sniff it and then I put her in it and she has such a good time laying down, rolling around, sniffing — just acquainting herself with the concept.  I hooked the attached seat belt to her harness to see how it worked and yes, indeed, it was perfect.  Then she decided to exit said care seat, still attached and discovered that it was very easy to drag all over the couch — I caught her before she tried to jump off the couch — trust me, no car seats or Yorkies were injured or endangered during this process.So, I am looking forward to going for our first drive —- maybe to Starbucks — someplace other than the vet.  And Trixie’s new year includes getting to know her niece—Olive My grandpuppy - a standard poodle that rares up like a horse and likes to hit me with her huge paws.  We are going to introduce them — I have been hesitant to do so because Trixie is so little and Olive is so, well, not — so we will see.  It will be a big ask for both of them I think although Olive socializes at a dog park and Trixie has been very social at the vet (I caught her giving kisses to a medium size shaggy boy who was waiting for his appointment) so, crossing fingers.So, that is our day so far — it is very cold outside but sunny and nice.  Have some errands to run and looking forward to the warm up tomorrow!"},
{"title": "The End of Yet Another Year", "date": "Thursday, December 28, 2023", "text": "As 2023 draws to a close I am taking a moment to sit back and think about all that has happened, or not happened, this year.  I read facebook posts about what a horrible year it was and how people will be glad to see it end and I know this year has been hard for many but for me, personally, it has been decent.I look back on our accomplishments and there isn’t much to see — being retired and not as active as we once were, we are sort of treading water most of the time, just keeping on keeping on.  We did purchase a new car to replace my Subaru.  It was a much needed change.We continued to help with after school care for Bean and also did some transporting of our other grandchildren, N, K, and E.  During the summer we took our grandson, N, back and forth to TCU so he could work as a tech at the Van Cliburn piano competition..  It is truly a blessing to have time with these precious kids — they are growing up way too fast.We watched huge changes at our church.  At the end of 2022 we watched our beloved rector, David Klein, retire which was a good thing for him but we were sad to see him leave.  However, he isn’t far and has been sighted in the area and rumor has it he is visiting our parish often — I just haven’t caught him yet! In February of 2024 we will welcome a new rector, Sam Wilgus.  Our interim rector, Richard Moseley will be leaving us in that capacity but as he is a long time parishioner I am hoping he joins our ranks as a member again. Personally, we have been blessed with decent health — no major illnesses, no hospitalizations and no broken bones. The hubs did spend a good deal of the middle of the year dealing with vestibular vertigo due to a middle ear infection.  He spent three months in rehab to regain his balance and he is now sporting a snazzy pair of hearing aids which is a blessing to us all!We did take a short trip to College Station last week which was fun.  The weather held and it was enjoyable to see the college campus again.  It is a really pretty, yet really huge, campus and it is fun to see the old and the new converge.Trixie is well and even though we lost Bam Fox early in the year we have had fun watching the new crop of foxies that live under our deck.  Being a city gal I never thought I would be living so openly amongst wildlife but it is interesting.I did start an anxiety journal that has helped with my sometimes uncontrollable anxiety.  It sort of turned into a daily routine journal but surprisingly that has helped enormously with the anxiety.  I find it very therapeutic to make a to-do list and actually mark things off — it helps calm the mind.  I will continue into the new year BUT that is not a resolution, just a promise — I don’t believe in resolutions.While I haven’t done a lot of cross stitch this year (to be remedied soon) I have done a bit of reading.  My original goal was45 books but around Thanksgiving I realized that I wasn’t going to make that goal so I changed my criteria — still not going to make my new goal but I am close.  I have learned that while challenges are fun it is more fun to read for the sake of reading than to read to satisfy some arbitrary number. I still have two to finish and I am sure I will finish one at least to almost fulfill my goal.  Who knows, maybe two. So, that is our year in a very small nutshell.  We have had many enjoyable moments this year, we have learned a lot and we have so, so much to be grateful for.  I am praying for more of the same for 2024.I will end this now as it is beginning to sound like the dreaded Christmas newsletter!"},
{"title": "I’m Baaaaaack!", "date": "Tuesday, December 26, 2023", "text": "I haven’t really been gone, just a bit busier than usual which doesn't take much — I am quite slothy most of the time.Last week we took a short day trip to College Station, Texas, home of the great Texas A&M University with my daughter and granddaughter.  My daughter needed her ring (the pride of all Aggies) resized so we needed to go to the Ring Office, have her sized and leave the ring for adjustment.  It will take 4-6 weeks.  We will then drive back to pick up said ring.  My daughter is very proud of her education and ring and the fact that she has a long Aggie legacy —dad, uncles, cousins — it is a family thing.  I did not go to school there but my association with the school and the traditions has been ongoing since 1965 so trust me, I am an Aggie by default!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7yYEoFgG4IIt was strange this year with Advent 4 and Christmas Eve being on the same day.  So, we had Advent 4 service at 10 a.m and Christmas Eve at 4 pm and 11 p.m.  We went to the first service while my daughter and her family attended both — Bean had to acolyte at 10 and my daughter had to read at 4 — was that bad planning on the people putting together the program or was it sly to make sure everybody was in church to celebrate both?  Hmmm….. well, it worked because there was a full house for all the services which is a very good thing.Our Bean is the acolyte on the left — the only girl, the only red head! Can’t miss her.So, Christmas Eve, after the 4 pm. Service we went to my daughter’s house for our traditional tamales and chili con queso and gift exchange.  A good time was had by all.After a reasonably good night (for some reason Trixie thinks 5 a.m. is a great wake up call) we got up on Christmas morn to find that Santy Paws had indeed come so a bit of playtime ensued.  Later we had a nice dinner of ham, pasta salad, two kinds of beans, tossed salad and pie.  I couldn’t settle on a Christmas movie so I opted for another episode of “Heartland”.  I am really enjoying the series.  I did watch my traditional movie “The Bell’s of St. Mary’s” while fixing the food during the day.  It wouldn’t be Christmas without it.So, we had a very quiet Christmas but we are feeling refreshed and renewed and ready to take on the new year!"},
{"title": "Still Here!", "date": "Friday, December 15, 2023", "text": "Hi, all!  Still here! Still removing from the Thanksgiving plague although I think now it has just morphed into miserable allergies what with the mountain cedar and all — I can handle that!  Just been getting some stuff done == a little decluttering, a little mailing, a lot of reading - yep, our weather has been nice but it has turned nasty now and all it is good for is a nice cuppa and a good book.I have finished the first three books in the Weezy and BeBe series and am starting on the fourth — well, already started last night.  So far it is engaging and with our drizzly, cold day all I want to do is finish it!  Today!I wish I could get in the Christmas spirit but alas, it is alluding me.  I think now that the kids are all big and into their own things it sort of dampens the excitement of it all but I will be feeling it on Christmas Eve when we head to church and back home for our traditional Mexican dinner.Our youth group received donations from the congregation and went shopping for toys for donation.  They had a great time and then, Wednesday night, they took the toys to the drop off place and then went to dinner at In And Out.  They had a wonderful time.  It might be a small group of kids but they are certainly getting busy with their community service and their fun activities.So, that is about it for now —I have been up since 5 a.m. thanks to Miss Trixie so I am already dozing and it is only 8 a.m.  Ha!  However, my daughter’s car is in the shop so we have already been on school drop off for her and Bean! Thanks goodness Christmas vacay starts today!Have a great weekend!"},
{"title": "Poor Baby Bean —- ", "date": "Friday, December 08, 2023", "text": "Night before last our church youth group went to WallyMart to purchase toys for a toy drive.  There were $1000 in donations to the cause so each kiddo had $250 to spend. Here they are ready to shop — just look at those bright and shiny faces.And shop they did —They even got a bicycle and I have to say, somebody is going to be thrilled to receive that big stuffy!They had a wonderful time!  We don’t have a large youth group but we are working to grow it.  However they had fun and spent all their money and from the looks of those baskets they did well.Then, yesterday Bean had to go to the orthodontist go get her braces put on.  That beautiful smile in the picture above turned to tears quickly.Not only did she get the brackets and wires on her top teeth, she got an expander in the roof of her mouth (not her mouth pictured)And a Herbst appliance in lieu of traditional head gear By the time we got her home yesterday she couldn’t talk, she was drooling like a teething infant and she can’t eat.  She cried her way through a bowl of mint chocolate chip ice cream.  I sent her home with mashed potatoes, apple sauce and soup.  Dad was at the store stocking up on soft stuff.  She is already just a little thing, I can’t imagine her losing weight.  However, her friend who happens to be a boy (hee hee, see what I did there) has had all of this in his mouth and he assured her she will eat again.  She already has food issues because she has a nut allergy and doesn’t trust anything to not have nuts in it so eating is a challenge at best.Hopefully today will be a better day."},

{"title": "Should’s and Shouldn’ts", "date": "Monday, December 04, 2023", "text": "I am not a big one for resolutions.  I never saw the point since I am incapable of keeping them!  Even into January 2!  And resolutions to me are just a list of all the things I need to “do”, to improve myself, to make my world a better place—an arbitrary list of things that I “should” do == designed by somebody else a lot of the time.We are influenced by so many things in our lives — our “situation”, our friends, the media, Pinterest — it is an ever ongoing onslaught to what we need to do better heavily implying that what we are doing isn’t right enough, isn’t correct enough and definitely needs tweaking.  We are bombarded by products that guarantee to improve all those things that are so lacking in our lives.  And, in my case, I never seem to have the correct “things”.   In trying to attain all the right “things” - either physical stuff or an improved attitude — I am becoming more and more disenchanted with things.Now, I am never going to be a minimalist — that just isn’t my style but there are some things I am going to eliminate from my existence because — well, I think it is a prudent thing to do.  These things aren’t adding to my life in anyway and, in a way, are only cluttering things up — if only in my mind.  I am sure that it is going to be comical to some and, in a way, it is but here we goPlanners/Diaries — My daughter uses a planner — she is a teacher, a mother, a Girl Scout leader - it makes sense.  I feel like I need to use a planner and I have spent a long time carrying an Erin Condrin around with me for what reason?  To look the part?  To let people know I spent upwards from $65 on a calendar?  And then looking for elusive shelf space to store years of these things on?  All because I think I “should” when all I need to keep up with is Beans school schedule and some medical appointments?   I can do that on my phone.  No more planners.Faux Plants —There is nothing green about my thumbs.  I can’t grow a simple ivy.  My house is too dark.  I forget to hydrate myself much less the plants so I resort to Faux.  I have some lovely faux ivy and it would be lovelier if I would dust it once in a while.  However, in regards to dusting, I do much better with flat surfaces with nothing on them.  So…buh bye faux plants.  Now to find a place to store the empty planters.  I can’t get rid of them because I made them myself in a ceramics group at our church but, they need to be put to rest.Meal Planning —When I was in junior high school, I took home economics.  My teacher was an ancient, old teacher named Birdie Chappell.  She wasn’t nearly as old as I thought but she had no patience with the likes of me — I refused to light the gas oven with a match.  I didn’t do well in there but I did learn a few things.  I learned how my mother, who took home ec from the very same teacher, came to plan her meals.  Instead of planning out what we would eat each and every day, my mother would go to the store and purchase a protein for each day, a starch for each day, vegetables for each day (because we shopped once every two weeks, a lot of canned goods there ) and fruit.  She would plan a dessert or two and call it done.  We didn’t have Taco Tuesday then — my mother would get up of a morning, check to see what she had and plan what she wanted for dinner from what she had.  That is what makes sense to me.  So, I am going back to what works for me — no more of these lists on a calendar of what I am going to eat the whole week because what sounds good at the store might not work for me on Monday or Tuesday.  I am going to live in the moment.  Well, except for Taco Tuesday — old habits die hard.Trying to Look Younger —What a wasted effort.  My emphasis is not going to be to look younger but to look healthy, have healthy skin.  This should result in some money saving as I don’t intend to jump on the bandwagon of every new product that promises everything and results in nothing.  I am 73, I look 73, I feel 73 (at least) and no amount of skin care voodoo is going to change that.  It is what it is so I am doing a huge declutter and going to relish in the lovely empty space in my drawer.Magazine Subscriptions —Yes, I have purchased two new ones to help the Girl Scouts but don’t intend to hold on to them and don’t intend to renew them.  I am doing away with magazines and it is really hard for me — my mind says “you paid good money for these things, now you must keep it — forever — even if it means adding on to the house”.  So, it is just easier to not buy them in the first place.   I can read them on my iPad with my kindle app.So far, these are the things on my mind.  I know it isn’t some earth shattering changes that will make my world all bright and shiny but it might result in some extra drawer space, less stuff to store, maybe eating a little healthier and the opportunity to focus on the world around me and less about what I see in the mirror.  Wow, so philosophical for so early on a Monday morning!  Whew!"},
{"title": "Happy Advent!", "date": "Friday, December 01, 2023", "text": "Today is the first day of Advent.  I love Advent because it is a quiet time … and I love quiet times.  Yes, I know Advent doesn’t officially start until Sunday but Dec. 1 is just such a nice place to start thinking about it.I put out some decor yesterday.  Being a person who can’t handle much clutter I did some scaling down this year.  I didn’t put out all that I have and I sort of switched stuff up a bit.  So, here are a couple of things I have added.Art work a la BeanLittle Scandi tree — I decided I really liked it without a skirt and Santa — I think it is cute!The ancient wreath that has followed me through three houses for over 30 years.Little ceramic tree which is new this year — I have always wanted one, never bothered  but when I saw them at Target this year I just bit the bullet and went with it.  I sort of wish I had gotten the green one but, oh well.  The little nativity next to it was purchased a few years ago at Apple Annie’s and the mosquito thing behind needs to be put away.  Please don’t pay much attention to my table as it is strewn with all sorts of meds …. This stupid cold/virus/infection just won’t go away!So, anyway, I have a couple of other things to add and will show those later — nothing major.  Have a happy Dec. 1!"},
{"title": "It is fixed — My bad", "date": "Thursday, November 30, 2023", "text": "My blog is fixed.  It should be back to normal.  I accidentally turned off reader access so — my bad!Thank you Mary for helping!  Now, back to Christmas “things”. For me I am firmly on that fence.I look at all the places — Pinterest, Facebook, blogs — and I see beautiful almost professionally done decorating for all the holidays.  I open my front door and look down the road and my eyes are attacked by something that, clearly, the Griswolds designed.  I love the gorgeous, can’t stand the tacky so where does that put me?Well, I was thinking about that this morning.  Being a mid-century child, I didn’t grow up with any of this sort of “fluff”.  It just didn’t seem to be done at the time — possibly a string of lights across the roof or a wreath on the door but that was not the norm.  My mother never strung lights and she never hung a wreath.We had a Christmas tree, in the early days they were real until we realized they made us sick, and of course, we had the fabulous aluminum tree of the time — it was a real hazard too.  We had a box full of ornaments that I have no idea where they came from but they weren’t new. One year by mother found a really cute little Santa doll with a sweet face, she bought it, and it went up on the piano every year.  She would scotch tape the incoming greeting cards to the back of the front door. She used a white sheet (they were all white) as a tree skirt.  Very minimal, not much to write home about, but my Christmas’s were magical.  The atmosphere was there even if the elaborate trappings weren’t.One year my kids griped so much about lights that my husband decorated the house — it resembled a runway at Dallas Love Field.  We only did that once or twice because it tended to blind the neighbors across the street.Nobody I knew, at the time, went to the lengths (and expense) that people do today to deck the halls.  We were all post WW2 kids living in post WW2 housing, in middle class neighborhoods and people just didn’t have the money and honestly, there wasn’t the availability of these decor items.  So, how do I, the person on the fence, manage the season?Every year I think to myself “I am going to go all out” and then, I don’t.  My big problem is storage of said items.  I could think of it as disposable but it is all a little too spendy for that.  So, whatever I buy I have to figure out where to put it up.  About 30 years ago I made a wreath, meaning I took an artificial wreath, added a ready made red bow, some felt gingerbread men and a couple of  seasonal “pics” and that thing has been going strong ever since.Now, it is a little dark so I decided I was going to string these tiny lights on it — well, that isn’t going to happen because the wire the lights are attached to are so fine and twisty I can’t figure out how to do it so the wreath is on the door in all it’s dark glory.  Our house is at the end of the cul-de-sac and honestly, it always looks so sad because there is nothing lit up but…..it is what it is.Early fall I bought two plant stands to add some floral interest to the porch.  I have added some faux poinsettas that I have had for about 20 years.  This might be their last year.  They are looking more shabby than chic.  But, they are out there now.For my Christmas tree I have decided to use a Scandi wooden dowel tree to showcase my Hallmark ornaments.  Much smaller than my very tall, fluffy, green, lit tree residing cozily in its box in the garage.  The skirt was purchased on sale a couple of years ago and the Santa was one I just had to have, purchased at the same time.  The tree came with a bunch of Scandi style ornaments but I opted to stay with my Hallmark plan.  Of course, the Christmas village is the focal point and that is not my thing - the hubs will deal with that when he gets the notion.So, what had made me make the decisions I have made about decor?Age and mobility — I just can’t climb around and crawl around and all that anymore.  Nobody helps be decorate the big tree and it is just too exhausting and difficult so, this year is our first Scandi Christmas!Expense — we are retired and both of us raised in a time and with parents that frivilousness (is that a word) took a back seat to the practical.  With me the practical always wins out and I really need to stop fighting it.  Plus, I find that I really enjoy having the things around me that have sentimental meaning rather than what is trending this year at Hobby Lobby.  You will see what I mean later.Storage Space — This is always an issue and it just seems counter productive to keep buying stuff when I am trying hard to declutter. Am I adding anything this year?  Am I decorating at all beyond what I have mentioned?  Why yes, I am and I will share photos when I am done.  It isn’t anything major either pricewise or size wise and won’t be an issue to put up or put away.  I am learning that small and steady is the way to go.So, yeah, no pics today but I will share some with things get pulled together.  I really wish Bean was home from school because she is going to be the one to decorate the tree.See you soon! Well it appears I ran all my friends off by posting about being worried about my blog being hacked.  It think it is fine, I haven’t had any weird activity — in fact, I haven’t had any activity at all!  I took the post down and am now waiting for my friends to return.Please come back.  All is well.  I think I was just over reacting. It is lonely here in my little corner of blog land.Sniff."},
{"title": "Post Thanksgiving Catch Up", "date": "Monday, November 27, 2023", "text": "Well, it is Monday after Thanksgiving and in years past, by this time, Christmas would be in full swing here.This year?Not so much.Why you ask?Well, the whole family got sick. It started with my son-in-law who got covid. Then my granddaughter was iffy all the week before Thanksgiving and she came home the last day before vacation sounding like she needed a tubercular rest cure and then, before my daughter could get her to to the doctor, she came down with it but she ran a fever — a little something extra for the already exhausted teacher.  So, they were down for the count and I had started with the aggravating cough and was feeling like something was brewing on my youngest granddaughter’s birthday.  Well, long story short, by the day after Thanksgiving it was all coming to a head with me and Saturday found me in the emergency clinic begging for somebody to take it away.We have quite the variety of emergency clinics around here — CareNow being the best known, I suppose, however a new one has popped up called Breeze, owned and operated by Texas Health.  Our regular doctor is also associated with Texas Health so I figured “what the hey, I will give it a go”.  It was Saturday, my choices were limited.So, I went to the website, read through it and they had the option to pick an open time slot, so I did — 10:30 a.m.  I then created an account and filled out all the check in information and read the procedure.  I was to arrive for my appointment, check in, and would be seen in a timely fashion (a little skeptical here as I have been in many ER’s and emergency clinics and timely isn’t always a “thing”).  They promised, on the website that in 30 minutes I would be done.  More on that later.I went back to check that I had done everything on the website and it greeted me by name and had already linked me up with our family doctor whose bright and shiny face was staring back at me from the screen. So, I figured all good.I walked in about 10:20, the girl at the desk took my insurance cards, scanned then and at 10:30 here comes a  nice little nurse to take me back.  She did all the info gathering and said the nurse practitioner would be in shortly and have a nice day.  I think these places are all staffed with nurse practitioners and I am fine with that— nurses are smart and they LISTEN.  So, as promised the NP comes in and listens to me talk, looks me over, announces that my ears are full of fluid which I knew and said my cold had turned into a sinus infection, raging conjunctivitis, and she would be prescribing three meds for it.  I thanked her very much, we had a nice chat, she sat there and actually listened to what I was saying and was very personable.  Her name was Katie.  I like Katie.  We should all be like Katie.So, here is the fun part — and I am serious, it was fun.These clinics have this —It is a prescription kiosk.  You go up to it and hit start and a real person comes on the screen and chats — and it is a real person, a real talking back person, and she explains the procedure that the prescriptions are being filled and will be dispensed through the machine, picked up through a little door much like going to the bank.  After which I got to speak to the pharmacist — another real person — who explained the prescriptions, how to be taken, what to expect and what they are for.  Saying “if you have any questions just call us”.  I mean, really, how awesome is that!And here is the clincher == I was taken back to the room at 10:30 on the dot.  I walked out with my meds at 10:55.And, it is really close to my house.  I could actually walk there if I absolutely had to.I was so impressed and glad I went out on a limb to visit this place.  When they pulled up my records they could see my doctors chart and this went on it so he knows what happened this weekend and I like that.  So, Thanksgiving was a wash — my husband cooked two turkey roasts but we never gathered as a family but that’s ok, nobody felt good enough.  We split the food between ourselves and our daughter so we all had turkey and dressing and cranberries and that was plenty.  I spent yesterday taking copious amounts of meds and watching Christmas movies.  I queued up the new Melissa McCarthy movie “Genie” and really enjoyed it but I like Melissa McCarthy — we share a name and we are both “ample” so what’s not to like?  She is about the only comedian I like these days.  Then I settled back for my old Christmas fav “Love Actually” after which I tuned in “Gilmore Girls” and fell asleep.  So, though not what I planned and at times pretty miserable Thanksgiving did have it’s good parts — “Genie”, turkey and a prescription kiosk — what more could a girl ask for? Uh, why has everybody disappeared?  I think my post about hackers has scared everybody away.  I took it down.  I have no reason to think my blog is in danger, just my paranoid self talking here.Come back, bloggy friends!!"},

{"title": "Beautiful Boy", "date": "Sunday, November 12, 2023", "text": "Yesterday afternoon I sat down to watch what has turned into to my daily movie viewing challenge.  Instead of going for something tried and true, you know, that I knew all the dialogue or words to the music, I decided to stay with the more contemporary (ahem, Timothee Chalamet) offerings.  I chose “Beautiful Boy” with Chalamet, Steve Carell, Maura Tierney and a host of others.  I have always liked Steve Carell and have seen him a number of things.  I loved “The Office” for his comic talent but I have seen him in dramatic stuff and he was top notch.  This performance was no different.I have been a fan of Maura Tierney since he “ER” days.  I am a sucker for a great medical series and “ER” didn’t disappoint (neither did “New Amsterdam” or “The Good Doctor”).  So, I was pleasantly surprised to see her in the cast.  She has always seemed so “real” to me and I like that in an actress.Timothee Chalamet surpassed expectation.  This boy gave the most gut wrenching, accurate performance I have seen in a long time.  I don’t usually chose to watch movies, or programs, that are so painfully graphic  but I feel that his performance was spot on.I was a visually dark movie so I can’t say much about the scenery but I will say the music was great — the showpiece being Lennon’s “Beauiful Boy”. Going with that though, this was the most painful, panic-producing, frightening movie I have seen in, well, a long time to not be a horror flick.  The agony that parents go through watching an addicted child that can’t be rehabilitated in indescribable.  By the time it was over I was hyperventilating, almost in tears, giving thanks that I never had to deal with a situation like this and swearing that I will not re-watch this movie, ever.I grew up in a part of the country that, as far back as I can tell, there was always a drug issue.  I was a teenager in the 60’s — the age of enlightenment, I knew a few kids that got sucked into the drug culture and didn’t come out of it.  However, I don’t think it was “then”  like it is “now” but I do blame “now” on “then”.   I blame my generation, to be honest, on a lot of the issues we see with our youth.  I don’t say that out loud and publicly but having lived across all these decades and seeing how things have changed I can’t help but believe that my generation was so instrumental in the issues facing our youth today.I can honestly say, though, “not me”.  I didn’t participate in the drug thing, I didn’t drink, I didn’t live loosely, I went to church and did my homework and grew up unaddicted (well, unless you count sugar) and reasonably functional.  And I can prove it.How you might ask?  I am 73 years old and I am still alive.  What does that mean?  There were things my parents wouldn’t tolerate — drugs/alcohol being one of them — and my mother lived by the old adage “I brought you into the world and I can take you out” and I have no doubt that she would have followed through.  I was her only shot at a baby but that didn’t mean she was going to put up with shenanigans — and I certainly didn’t test her.  She was tiny but a force to be reckoned with nonetheless.  Besides, I didn’t like the taste of alcohol and still don’t and I don’t like feeling groggy and out of control so it wouldn’t have been an issue anyway.  Enough about me, back to the movie.Do I recommend?  No, not if you are affected by the subject matter.  I won’t watch it again.  Yes, I recommend if you want to witness some really good performances.  This movie is a double edged sword.We moved on to the series “All the Light We Cannot See” which is different than we usually watch but so far it is very good.  It is in four parts and we watched the first two.  Makes me so glad I was born after the WW2 era."},

I have some chores to tend to this morning and then I am going to finish this book and plan a movie!  Not going to Girl Scouts this morning — they will just have to do without me!

{"title": "Little Women", "date": "Friday, November 10, 2023", "text": "I was an only child but had a sister figure in the form of my cousin who lived across the street.  She is four years older and my role model.  I don’t know how she feels about that, I will have to ask her one day, but, for the most part, I tried to emulate her.Our mothers dressed us alike from time to time, we read the same books, we went to the same schools, etc  and I figured if she did something then it was something good to do.  That worked until we grew older and our personal likes and dislikes began to define us — she was a thespian and under no circumstances would I ever get on a stage and actually speak but give me paper and a pen and I would be more than happy to write it for you — that was my desire, to write.So, as I followed in the footsteps of my cousin one of the first things I wanted to do was read an actual novel that she was reading — Little Women.  And I did although I conveniently left out the chapter in which Beth dies — she suggested it might be a bit much for me.  So, currently, I have never read the chapter in which Beth dies.  I guess I need to add that to a bucket list — if I had one.We also enjoyed the many versions of the movie of the same name.I never saw the 1917 and 1918 versions.  They were silent films starring people I had never heard of.  My first foray into the cinematic version of the book was the 1933 version starring Kathryn Hepburn as Jo and Douglas Montgomery as Laurie.I thought Hepburn made a “capital” Jo - to me she cinched the “Jo” vibe completely.  I think she was a natural for the part, tomboyish, not especially beautiful in that baby doll sort of way, and outgoing - yes, she made a perfect Jo.The next version that I have also watched a number of times is the 1949 version with June Allyson as Jo and Peter Lawford as Laurie.  I found June Allyson to not fit the part at all.  In the first place, she was very short and very cute and very blond — not the physical appearance that I ever applied to the book version of Jo.  She was perky and sweet and that is just not how I saw Jo.  So, while she did a great job and it was a successful movie, to me the casting could have been better.I though Elizabeth Taylor made an acceptable Amy except she wasn’t a blond and to make her a blond just didn’t work for me.  Margaret O’Brien was the perfect Beth and, in my opinion, Janet Leigh was “just there”.  I thought Peter Lawford as Laurie was good casting but then, I liked Peter Lawford!  I was a teenager in the “rat pack” era and there was Peter Lawford, front and center, and I really liked his movies — along with Sinatra.Then came the 1994 version of Little Women with Winona Rider and Christian Bale.  I have only seen this one a couple of times and it was ok — I especially liked Susan Sarandon and Mary Wickes as Aunt March. I think I need to go back and watch this one a third time and refresh my memory but I have to say, I don’t think it was the most memorable version for me.And that brings us to the 2019 version that I watched last night.  My daughter and I enjoyed this version in the theater with the Bean. She was 9 and I don’t know that she was that “into” it but I was.  Again, for me the setting is so important.  The book is set in Civil War era Massachusettes.  Being from the south, my thoughts on the civil war go to the stereotypical “southern” take on things so I enjoyed the setting being in Massachusettes.  I checked and it was actually filmed in Boston, Concord and the surrounding areas.  The external scenes of the Alcott house are real and I just loved seeing the landscape and city scenes in Massachusettes.  It just changed the whole thing for me — a whole new perspective.  Saorise Ronan was the perfect Jo.  She is the one actress that actually portrayed and projected the idea that a woman is more than just a homemaker, an obviously foreign concept for the time.  You could feel her frustration, however, and I think she did a marvelous job.  Emma Watson was so-so to me, Emily Scanlan’s Beth just didn’t have much of an impact but Florence Pugh’s Amy was spot on.  I thought Timothee Chalamet made a perfect Laurie but I have already admitted to having a soft spot for him — oh to be 19 again.The portrayal of the book was new and modern yet stayed on tap.  It followed the story line but in a more modern way with flashbacks and projections.  It jumped around a bit so you have to watch it — no fiddling with the iPad — you have to watch it but it keeps you on your toes.  And the ending was such a twist and I love the way it led you past Jo reconnecting with her German friend and leads you into the next chapter - the school and the book that would be ‘Jo’s Boys”.  Through graphics it lets you know how the characters are progressing.  A sequel would be spectacular.So, out of the various versions I would have to say that the 2019 version is my favorite.  Besides the fact that I made a memory by viewing it with my granddaughter and daughter, I was just enthralled by the scenery, the modernized presentation and the overall superior casting.  I really think Saorise Ronan is one of todays outstanding actresses — you know how everybody raves about Kathryn Hepburn? — Well, I believe Ronan has what it takes to be right up there with her.So, yes, I recommend the movie.  I think I might even buy it for my DVD collection  and yes, I still buy DVD’s."},
{"title": "Movies Part 2", "date": "Thursday, November 09, 2023", "text": "The weather has turned here and it is finally feeling more fallish — well, except for the few days we had of “fake fall”.  This is more like real fall — temperatures dropping, rain falling, the urge to nest hard to ignore.The Christmas decor is going up all over the place which is too early in my opinion but it does make your think about the upcoming month and what to do.One of the best ideas I have seen for those with children is to gift the children with twenty five books on the first day of Advent to be enjoyed through the season.  A great way to count down the days.  For me, I like to plan and watch a movie a day.  A seasonal movie that is.  I don’t limit it to Hallmark movies either, I like some of the old stuff and love to snuggle in with a cuppa and just go back in time.When I was a little girl, we spent Christmas Eve with my mother’s family, rotating each year between families so each family hosted once every four years.  In the beginning there were four of us granddaughters but in 1960 we were blessed with number 5 so there was always somebody to talk to or play with or confide in.  It was a lovely time — even when my young cousin decided to enjoy the “adult” egg nog and eat every black olive in the house — let it suffice to say that her Christmas Day wasn’t so grand!  My advice is just make sure your kiddo is drinking the UN-adulterated nog because 3 year olds with a little too much of the spirit isn’t a good thing!But, at the end of each celebration we would return to our own homes, don our brand new Christmas pajamas and head to bed so Santa could come.Well, except for me.  I had to stay up and watch “The Bells of St. Mary’s”.  Every year.  It came on after the 10 pm news.  AND, as if that wasn’t enough, my little Catholic heart housed in my little Protestant body had to watch midnight mass.  I think back about my mother almost pleading with me to go to bed — I am sure those are the years that Santa needed help assembling something — a doll house comes to mind.  I finally crashed and I am sure she did too because I remember the doll house being assembled on Christmas Day.Ah, the things we remember.But, those days are long past — now we get to choose when we watch our favorite Christmas/Holiday fare.  The streaming world has made it much easier for those parents who have weird children like me — well, except for midnight mass — but, unfortunately, this old girl can’t stay up for it anymore!  I fall asleep no matter where I am, like during the debates last night.  Sorry, I digress.So, my first Christmas movie will be “Love Actually”.  I just really enjoy the cast and the story line —Liam Neeson, of course, and Alan Rickman — I am so sorry he is no longer with us — but isn’t his character a cad?  I know, who even says that, but that is the nicest way I think to describe the character — but he does it so well!I will end the season of Advent with “The Bells of St. Mary’s” as I always do.  It just isn’t Christmas without it.Now, what happens in between is anybody’s guess — it is up for grabs — it might even be a spur of the moment thing — I will let you know!Do movies play a part in your holiday plans?"},
{"title": "My Second Most Favorite Thing", "date": "Wednesday, November 08, 2023", "text": "Reading is perhaps my first love, as pastimes go.  Second only to it are movies.  Movies have always been a large part of my life and continue to be.  I have recently identified myself as a HSP (highly sensitive person) and I respond very profoundly to the arts and movies get quite the reaction from me.As I mentioned a bit ago, my father was in the media in my young childhood and when I was about 10 or so he decided to become the Cecil B. DeMille of San Antonio, Texas.  There are so many things wrong with that concept but I digress.  When he left the field of news reporting he opened an audio visual business where he did several things including some political films for up and coming politicians.  He also made three movies — one being It is a terrible movie, made in San Antonio and surrounding areas and starring many folks from the local little theater.  I mean, when you consider that San Antonio is not a movie making paradise, maybe it wasn’t so bad but…..I still watch it every year on my father’s birthday because he is a narrator and I can hear his voice and I can hear my own as a “screamer” off camera.  Not everybody can say those things so there is thatAnyway, we were big movie goers.  We went to the movies almost every weekend.  We frequented the neighborhood theater And the closest drive in theater —When my parents didn’t go I would go with my cousin.  How many movies I sat through with her — some more than once — “West Side Story” comes to mind.  Oh, and “Lawrence of Arabia”.  So many movies, so many hours, so many memories.So, today, I am still watching movies.  I watch old movies, like vintage black and white films (The Haunting of Hill House” is a go-to). For a while now I have found it difficult to sit through a full length movie without fidgeting and messing with my iPad and stitching — I blame it on my anxiety — I think I am going to buy a fidget spinner.  However, lately we have done a lot of streaming — “Yellowstone”, “Heartland”, “Call the Midwife”, etc. so I am actually sitting for a longer period and watching and am finally able to watch a whole movie.Now, I have to say that when I was young I always admired the male leads in the movies.  I had the fiercest crush on Frank Sinatra when I was about 11.  My father didn’t get it, Sinatra was an old man, he said, but as we all know the movies keep you forever young.  I believe “Young at Heart” is my favorite Sinatra movie but “From Here to Eternity” was a fav as well.So recently my attention was grabbed by the current Bleu de Chanel ad featuring Timothee Chalamet.  All I will say about this is I am old, not dead.  “Nuf said, check it out and see if you concur.  Anyway, I started looking at his movies and yesterday I sat and watched “A Rainy Day in New York”.  Typical Woody Allen.  Woody Allen is weird, I like his work but I find him repulsive so I am glad this movie didn’t star him — I would have never watched it.  But I enjoyed it.  It stared Chalamet, Elle Fanning and Selena Gomez — all up and coming young stars and they were great but what was even better was the setting —Let’s face it, the setting is what makes a movie, right?  The apartments (“You’ve Got Mail”, for instance), the outdoor scenes (“In the Garden of Good and Evil”) and the “Rainy Day” movie.  I will probably watch it again just to enjoy the scenery — I have never been to New York so it was a treat.Today I might watch the 2019 version of “Little Women”, also starring Chalamet along with Saoirse Ronan, another of my favorite young stars.  I saw “Little Women” in the theater with granddaughter and loved it and I think today might be a good day or, perhaps on Thursday when we will be having a cold rain — so cozy!So, I recommend any of the above mentioned movies for your viewing pleasure.  Well, except for my father’s.  I loved my father but I don’t recommend his movie and no, that isn’t a tease.  I really don’t.  Do you watch movies?  What are your favorites?  What genre?  You have heard of book clubs — maybe somebody should start a movie club!  Yeah, no, not me.  I still have to get a fidget spinner.Have a wonderful day!"},
{"title": "Repeating Myself All Over Again", "date": "Monday, November 06, 2023", "text": "I have made this declaration before and failed to live up to it but next year….I read a lot.  I read on a Kindle mostly.  I subscribe to Kindle Unlimited.  Why?  Because I have run out of bookshelf space and I have no where to put any more.  So, I have been wading in the world of cyber books.  It’s all good.I use Goodreads to keep up with my books and my friends and to get ideas for new reads.  It is a cozy place to visit.Several years ago I started participating in the Goodreads yearly challenge.  Year before last I swore I wouldn’t do it again yet, here I am finishing up my 2023 challenge.  Swearing to never do it again.Why you might ask?  Well, I find the idea of reading to complete a challenge takes away from the idea of reading for enjoyment.  When you find yourself re-reading your granddaughter’s childhood books just to get something quick on the list, I believe that defeats the purpose.  When I was a child I would go to the library, pick up a couple of titles and be in reading heaven for two weeks until the books were due.  If I was lucky we would have one of the slow, steady, monsoon-like rains that were common in South Texas and I could sit and read all day.Now it is a matter of meeting the challenge.I am on a couple of reading groups on Facebook and people are sharing so many interesting books, I have a “want to read” list on Goodreads and am adding to it daily.  But I want to really delve into these books — not just gloss over them to meet the challenge requirement.So, for 2024 I will continue to list my books as I read them, and review them, but I will no longer participate in a challenge — it is just setting me up for failure.Right now I am reading “The Florist on Amelia Island” the fourth book in the Seven Sisters series by Hope Holloway.  It is about a family, the Wingates, who live on Amelia Island.  There are seven girls between the elder Wingates and each has a story.  So far there are five books in the series - the fifth hasn’t been published yet.  I recommend this series as it is engaging, picturesque, romantic and not dreadful in any way.  I tend to read series, I always have, I guess when I find a book I like I hate to see it end.  So, yeah, next year when I post that I am starting my new challenge could somebody please save me from myself? Thanks!"},

But, see, it is things like that that make me anxious.I dug out the journal and started again — I even had to look up what I was doing and how I was doing it.This is what today looks like —I had been using MyFitnessPal to try to control the eating and it is great but, writing it down in my own hand seems to make a bigger impact on me.  I know my sugar intake is part of my anxiety issue so that is my first thing to tackle.  One thing I am learning about myself is that I am a visual learner — I think I already knew that — but in trying to journal and keep tabs on things it is very apparent to me that do much better if I write it down and refer back to it rather than just put it into my phone/iPad/computer and never look at it again.So, I have devised a new planner in a mini binder to start on January 1.  I will show more later but I did purchase a ready made calendar to go along with some other useful pages to do, pretty much, what I do in the journal.  I am hoping to figure out about meal planning as well because I am miserable stinky at that!So, here I am, starting over again, AGAIN! I feel pretty bummed that I am never going to get my weight under control and that I am always going to be swimming in anxiety but I am not giving up yet!  On today’s list are two things that I am hoping to accomplish —- muffin making and dragging out my cross stitch.I have been trying to get back to the cross stitch for several weeks now.  I even brought my stuff down here to my chair but here it sits.  I am just not motivated and yet I know that once I put in that first stitch I will be back on board — it is that first stitch.And after reading Granny Marigold’s post about baking, I am inspired.  I did make some muffins for the grand girl yesterday (she was under the weather so she was with me for the day — I loved it).  The final product was ok but not wonderful so I am going to make them from scratch today — wonderful product “scratch” — you can do so much with it!So, after I made my anxiety journal entry for this morning I felt infinitely better.  I felt back in control.  My day has an outline, a purpose.  It is amazing the power that pen and paper hold.  Have a wonderful Saturday!

Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania to a coal mining family, he went to work in the mines at age 11.  World War 1 found him in boot camp in San Antonio, Texas where he met my grandmother.  They married after a whirlwind courtship and moved to Scranton.  However, they relocated to San Antonio where he lived the rest of his life and they raised their four children.  My grandfather was a gruff little man — little meaning 5’4”!  He was not a talker or a sentimental person.  He rarely talked about his life in Pennsylvania and we didn’t ask.  But, I adored him.  I spent lots of time with him and truly felt the loss when he passed.I believe this photo might have been taken on their wedding day but I am not sure.So, today is catch up day - laundry mostly.  So, I best get started. I bought a new vacuum cleaner —A Riccar— I have named it Ricky.  See what I did there?  Anyway, I have used it twice and it seems to work well.  I am using this instead of my Dyson V8 Animal because it just doesn’t have the capacity to deal with Trixie’s messes.  What messes you might ask?  Well, my medicine cabinet is a wire shelf in my pantry.  As my husband was putting away some purchases he must have knocked down a packet of Miralax — one of the individual serving packets.  For some reason Trixie thought that might be a good plaything so I had a torn up packet and powder all over the living room carpet.  It vacuumed up the mess nicely and fortunately I don’t think Trixie got any of the medication, at least not enough to bother her, so the worst thing was the mess and the vacuum performed nicely.Sigh — kids, even fur babies — what can you do?"},
{"title": "Trixie’s Vet Visit", "date": "Monday, October 30, 2023", "text": "We went to the vet for Trixie’s follow up.  Her UTI is not gone so more antibiotics.  Her allergies are raging irritating everything possible, her ears, eyes, paws and the allergies could be part of the UTI.  So, she got more meds, an allergy shot, I have to start her on Claritin and I am wiping her down every evening to try to reduce the amount of allergens on her body.She goes back in two weeks.She does have the early stage of a collapsing trachea so I have to find a groomer that doesn’t use the loop around her neck.  OR…..I can sedate her prior to the appointment.  I will talk to Petco or I need to find  an independent groomer.  Sigh. Ok, so am doing a trial run of Farmer’s Dog for Trixie.  They sent 16 days of food, four packets, a fourth of a packet per day — I split that into two meals.  It is very little food.  I mean, after I split her daily ration into two meals, put it in the dish, mix a little warm water to warm it up — you can still see the bottom of the dish.  I know she isn’t a large dog and doesn’t need to eat copious amounts of food and she is already chonky but….She liked the beef ok but she really doesn’t care for the chicken.  I am having a problem getting her to do much more than sniff at it.  She is in the habit of sharing my oatmeal in the morning but, before the FD, she wasn’t eating it well either but today was an oatmeal sort of day (39 degrees outside). So I gave her a couple of spoonfuls — three times — and she wanted more.  How do I know?She brings me the bowl.  I decided she didn’t need a 4th refill though and now she is mad at me — I won’t give her more and I have now taken the bowl away from her.  And….I am thinking of cancelling the subscription to Farmer’s Dog.  It is really pricey and I really don’t like having to coax her to eat — I can do that with Fresh Pet which is cheaper.Sigh — today is her followup appointment for her emergency room visit.  Now we have to discuss the possible collapsed trachea.  What a way to start the week.  Have a good one folks! I will let you know what the vet says."},

I had to pick the kibble out of the food and warm it with a little warm water and then she was good to go.  Sheesh.  Yes, I know, spoiled!On our Target run this morning I finally remembered to get her allergy eye drops.  She does have a problem with allergies and her eyes get very irritated.  So, the vet wants me to use this —I have tried putting eye drops in her eyes before and I will say, it isn’t pretty.  So, I will wait until she goes to sleep and try then.  I am sure they will help because her eyes do give her problems.  I also have some gel stuff to use on them — she does better with that if you can imagine. So, it looks like we have Trixie all sorted out.  I am anxious to see what the vet says about her trachea but that is Monday.  I really hope I can take her back to Petco because it was convenient and nice and they did a good job.  We will see."},

{"title": "For Your Viewing Pleasure", "date": "Wednesday, October 25, 2023", "text": "Writing this blog post has been enlightening. I have been alive since the inception of television in San Antonio, Texas.  That makes me sound very old, which I am but it isn’t a bad thing.Television came to San Antonio on December 11, 1949 when WOAI-TV aired at 4:30 in the morning.  It was the NBC affiliate.  Then, on February 15, 1950 KENS - TV signed on under the call letters of KEYL.  That was two weeks before I was born.  My father had been in radio before he went off to help Uncle Sam in 1943 and when he came back television was booming and he wanted to be a part of it.  So, he did and was the nightly anchor at KENS-TV for a number of years.  In this very building.  In 1957 KONO, now KSAT, the ABC affiliate signed on for the first time.  It was in the winter and I remember running across the street to my cousin’s house to watch it come on — we watched the test pattern for hours — and hours — and finally, viola, there it was — and it was news.  Ugh.  Back then television viewing was simple.  You bought the set — early on they had screens of about 10 inches — plugged it in, fiddled with the antenna and, if you were lucky, you could enjoy all sorts of viewing pleasure —- including watching my dad do the news and weather with a tear off paper map and a grease pencil.  It was so high tech — not — well, maybe for the time.I remember getting bigger and better sets, I remember color coming in, I remember having VCR’s and finally getting cable.Now what do we have?  A hot mess!We ditched cable a number of years ago because we were paying large sums for large numbers of  channels we never used for various reasons.  We bought a Roku.  We were intrigued by the streaming channels being offered — and have subscribed to several — enough to make the bill almost as high as cable but what can I say —And network TV has tanked.  There is very little on anymore and most nights I watch re-runs of “Frasier” from 7 to 9.  But, I had to subscribe to Paramount+ in order to watch the new reboot of the old 90’s sitcom.  I may or may not keep it — the show needs to get better and I need to watch more on there than just “Frasier” and, so far, that hasn’t happened.Hubs and I are creatures of habit.  We tend to watch BritComs on PBS as well as British cozy mysteries.  Then, we have honed in on two popular programs — “Yellowstone” and “Heartland”.  I have tried to watch “Yellowstone” a number of times but just couldn’t get into it.  So I decided to watch the two prequels — “1883” and “1923”.  I recommend both.  They are available for streaming but I purchased the DVD’sI recommend both of these with some warning — graphic content, not for children.But, by watching these I was able to get into “Yellowstone” and am enjoying it thoroughly.We also watch “Heartland” which was recommended to me by a cousin.  It is much calmer than “Yellowstone” and definitely family friendly.  There are a lot of seasons of it which makes binge watching possible without running out of shows.  I watch it on Youtube and there are still new episodes being added.So, what do you watch on tv?  How do you watch tv?  I will say that my tv watching has slowed down these days because, for some reason, I just can’t handle all the noise — it seems to be so loud these days — and I have learned to really love silence.  That takes us back to the third sentence of this blog entry.Have a wonderful day!"},

I am thinking after lunch is a good time.  I will have to try it out.I have to say that my television viewing has sort of interfered but that is another post.  Do you watch “Yellowstone”?  “Heartland”?  More later."},
{"title": "The Garden Center — So Out of My Comfort Zone", "date": "Saturday, October 21, 2023", "text": "I am not an outdoorsy person.  I am not a gardener.  Growing up I was allergic to all things outdoors and my mother had a yard service so I am severely lacking in interest and desire to do anything yard-y.  I do love to look at everybody’s yard though, they are so lovely.I have a problem with our yard.  It is huge.  It is long and narrow.  The patio right off the house is too small and the deck, which is home to the foxes and possum, is too inconvenient.  So, between all of that and the fact that I get all allergy ridden if I stay out too long, it just isn’t my gig.  My husband, however, doesn’t mind tinkering in the yard but we are getting older and he isn’t quite as strong and able as he once was so our interaction with the yard is very basic. The previous owners plants photinias all along the back fence.  There re at least 50 of them out there and some of them have some sort of virus and we are losing them.  They are huge and he is having to take them out as they die and they need to be replaced with something.  I don’t like large shrubs - it is a security thing with me, plus they are really hard to trim when they are so tall.  So, we went to the Garden Center to look around.I didn’t walk around the plant area but they have a fantastic gift area.  At the front they have all the fall/Halloween decor and toward the back they have all the Christmas stuff.  It is all gorgeous and I could have spent a fortune there.And this is what I bought —A little ceramic pumpkin with an LED candle inside.  Everything “fall” was on sale for 25% off.  That ws a good thing because this little pumpkins is, well, little.  So, it is going on my dining table.  I will show you later.Then we went for a burger and now we are home and need naps.  We seem to always need a nap these days.I decided to sign Trixie up for food delivery from Farmer’s Dog.  She seems to like eating people food just fine but doesn’t want to eat her dog food — this has been her habit all her life but I don’t cook for us, I sure don’t need to cook for doggo so we will see how it goes.  I am sure we won’t continue past the first box.  Sigh.Have a wonderful weekend all!"},
{"title": "Trixie Update", "date": "Friday, October 20, 2023", "text": "Yesterday was better, Trixie seemed to be back to her normal self — almost.  She takes her meds (Amoxicillan) beautifully in her favorite thing — pill pockets and I haven’t had to give her anymore gabapentin.But, she still seems under the weather and is off her food.  Well, except for the plain pasta I was hand feeding her last night.  She eats Fresh Pet and Purina One kibble (and I am trying out a bit of Blue kibble too, it isn’t going well).  She doesn’t want any of it so now I am cooking chicken and rice.  Never mind carrots because she removes them.So, we will see how it goes.  I hope she is a little perkier soon.  She is drinking water though and sleeping a whole lot.  If she isn’t better by Monday we will be making a visit to her regular vet.And then I have to find a new groomer.Sigh — with kids — it is never ending."},
{"title": "Emergency Room!", "date": "Wednesday, October 18, 2023", "text": "Yesterday was rough for Trixie.  We had dental appointments on the other side of town which meant we left about 8:45 to get there.  And we did get there — a half hour too early.  Trixie was in her crate as she always is when we leave the house.  We crate her because she is a mischief maker and no telling what she might get into.So, we got finished at the dentist and headed to Hubs favorite Mexican restaurant.  Surprisingly it was open as they tend to close on a whim and you never know unless you call first.The thing about our town is — it isn’t a huge place but it takes forever to get anywhere so by the time we got to the restaurant we were starving.  We ate and had just enough time to get back over here to get in the school pickup with a quick stop by the house to pick up a snack I promised The GrandGirl.  We finally got home about 4:30, let Trixie out of her crate, leashed her and took her out to visit the yard.  We took her four times in the span of about 5 minutes (she goes out on a leash).  Uh oh, something wasn’t right.  She came in the house and started running — all over the place — and was frantic.  She wouldn’t sit down, she wouldn’t lay down, she wouldn’t do anything and finally spent an hour running in circles around the coffee table.I told Hubs that something was very wrong and, I might be wrong, but I figure she had an UTI.  So, since it was already 6:30 p.m. and the vet was long closed we headed to the brand new emergency veterinary facility across the highway, no more than 10 minutes awayIt was a nice, clean facility  but a little strange — it was one large room with a centrally located bank of exam tables and computer kiosks.  There were several vets, several vet techs, some lab personnel and some office personnel.  All of us were in the one big room.  There were some individual exam rooms along the periphery of the room.  But, the thing that caught my attention was — all the personnel were women.  Not that I have an issue with that, I certainly don’t, but it just unusual I thought. Especially since the majority of them were tall, blond and they all looked alike -Stepford Vets.  Sorry, I couldn’t resist but they were really quite lovely ladies and very compassionate and caring.So, anyway, we spent a couple of hours here with about six of our new best friends — a black and white cutie with something wrong with it’s throat, a big white something who was clearly attached to it’s hooman mother and had to be touching her at all times, a tiny baby Schnauzer and two cats — one that was very vocal about being there.  Oh and a little Frenchie who had some sort of an accident and skinned his rump.  So, here we were.  As our visit went on we learned that Trixie was in good health, was fat (hmmpppp), her chest sounded good, her temperature was normal and what they had to determine was whether her odd behavior was medical or emotional.  So, they presented me with an estimate of possible courses of action and the estimate was teetering dangerously close to the $1000 mark.  So, since I suspected that she was having a bit of a UTI I declined all the blood work and went for the urinanalysis.  As I suspected it came back with her showing to be on the leading edge of an infection - not fully raging but there were white blood cells and bacteria.  So, they sent me home with the dog, an antibiotic and something to calm her down, that something being gabapentin.So, I administer the antibiotic and about an hour later one of the gabapentin.  I could give her 1 to 3 tablets depending on what state of “calm” I wanted her in.  One was a gentle calm, two was more intense, and three she would be sedated.  I opted for one.It did nothing.  This dog walked around the coffee table in a circle until 1 a.m. when I decided to give her another and put her in the crate she sleeps in.  She cried, she yelped, she growled and barked and up we got.  And down we went.  And up we got — All night.Finally about 3 am I told her we had to go to bed — we had no choice because I was going to die if we didn’t so off we went and I had a solid 2 before it all started again.  So here we are, 6:30 a.m., I am miserably sleepy and dangerously tired, my hip is killing me from trying to sleep in the chair and here is Trixie. —Yes, under my aunts crocheted blanket.  Sawing logs.  No noises, no stress, just easy peaceful sleep.  I won’t show you a photo of me.  It would break the internet.  What a night.  I hope she is better today."},
{"title": "Back to the Business of Cross Stitch", "date": "Thursday, October 12, 2023", "text": "One of the things I like to buy as a souvenir when I travel is a cross stitch pattern or kit relevant to the place I am visiting.  One such kit was the lovely bookmark I purchased at the Westminster Abbey gift store back in 2005. It was a lovely project — the Aida fabric has a silky finish to it, the felt backing was thin and fine and the threads were top quality.  I have toted this bookmark around with me since I finished it.  I even reproduced it for a friend but the materials I used locally weren’t as fine as the ones in the kit.So, a couple of years ago we took a trip to Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia.  We tend to visit historically significant places and they all touch me but no place has touched me like Williamsburg.  I had a lot of trouble hobbling around with my sore knee but the kind folks at the park provided many benches for those of us who needed to sit (and there were a LOT of us) and I enjoyed sitting and just feeling the history around me.  But, I had to find the needlework area to purchases a kit of some sort.I sent my daughter and husband off looking for the proper shop — I would catch up later — and they did find it and I did catch up and I was totally in awe of what the shop had to offer.  I don’t remember which shop it was but it had all manner of reproduction fabrics for period clothing and bedding and such.  I have long since abandoned quilting because I find it difficult with arthritis so I wasn’t interested in purchasing the fabric but I was so excited to find several cross stitch kits.I settled on this one —The vibrant colors spoke to me and the fabric included is similar in silliness to the bookmark fabric.So, I started and put it away for various reasons and now I want to begin again and here is where I am.And what a mess —So when picking up cross stitch again after breaking my arm I realized that due to loss of use in my left hand (20-25% loss of usage) I was having difficulty using a q-snap.  It was bulky, awkward and heavy so I decided to do some stitching in hand.  It was better than the q-snap but I discovered that trying to keep the fabric tension my hand was getting really tired and achy.As a result I started looking at traditional hoops.  I settled on this one from Hoop and Frame out of Austin, TexasI even bought the fancy schmancy French made twill tape to wrap the inner hoop.  It was so lush!  So, now I am ready to get back to it.  Part of the reason I put it aside was to do some little pieces for my granddaughter’s room — Those pieces were done from patterns I bought as pdf patterns and stitched using my iPad.  This Williamsburg piece is a paper pattern in four pages and I am considering taking a picture, putting it in GoodNotes and stitching without the paper.  I seriously hope I don’t have any problem getting back into the pattern because I really want to finish this one before I start anything else and yet……I am still collecting patterns!  I think that is just part of the joy of it!That is what I am doing today. I got up this morning, took the Trixster for a walk using a new, short walking leash — hoping there would be less tripping — yeah, not so much. I then turned on the tv to catch up on the most recent dreadful news and then set about making lunch.  I roasted a chicken yesterday to have for a couple of days and supplemented with baked potatoes, salad and yellow squash.  We are “lunch” eaters so I have the kitchen mostly cleaned up, planned dinner for Skippy our resident fox and have been messing with the cross stitch.  It has been a good day — fall was definitely here this morning, my husband cut the grass and it has just been a slow, easy day."},

{"title": "The Reading of Books", "date": "Tuesday, October 10, 2023", "text": "I love books.  I have always been a reader and probably always will be.  I love to shop for and buy physical books but my aging eyes and hands have veered me into the path of electronic reading which I do on my kindle, which I also love.  Using a kindle (or other e-reader) is nice because of ease of transport.  And, for me, it is easier on my hands because it is not as bulky.  The design of the screen makes it easy to read in direct sunlight or in the dark.  That works for me because the bulk of my reading is done in the school pick up line or in bed before I go to sleep (I know, they say that isn’t a good idea). I rarely buy books because I subscribe to Kindle Unlimited which allows be to “borrow” books and then return them for a flat monthly fee.  However, I have bought a couple of books which are now part of my permanent library.  One of these books is —It looked good, it sounded good, I was looking so forward to jumping in and yet, I can’t get into it.  So, because I actually own it, I decided to set it aside and move on with my next choice which is the first book in the series “The Purrfect Murder” by Nic Saint.  Now, I love cozy mysteries but I am not sure I can get my head around this talking cat thing — I mean, I am really jealous — I wish Trixie could talk and had opposing thumbs.  I digress.But, since I can’t abandon two books I will carry on with the Max the Cat and his person Ophelia Poole.  His side kicks are Dooley and Harriet and I have to admit, they are hilarious.  Maybe it will get better as I go on.I don’t know why I can’t get into “Small Angels”.  I have never shied away from spooky, ghostly stories and I thought it would be a perfect read with the change in the weather.  One of my favorite authors is Shirley Jackson of “Haunting of Hill House” fame.  She also wrote another piece, lesser known but equally good entitled “We Have Always Lived in the Castle” which I highly recommend.  I received it as a Christmas present when I was 13 and I couldn’t put it down, finished it in a day.  And, of course, Jackson’s most famous work —Sorry, the title is hard to read, it appears.And, if you want to get really spooky you can always try —I have a copy, I might pull it out but I read it years ago and it might be a little too demonic for me now —- I might have to stick with Max the cat!So, what do you like to read when the weather turns, the pumpkins are out and the spooky season is upon us?  I could use some good recommendations."},

So I am making an activity plan — a routine like I used to have when my kids were little — you know, laundry one day, grocery shopping another….blah, blah, blah, like the poem of my childhood.  I have discovered, with my anxiety journal, that I am a creature of routine — I need it, I thrive on it and if I don’t have it I am just treading water and sinking fast.  So, I decided that today we would go to the grocery store….well, I had to start somewhere..  I absolutely hate going to the grocery store.  Mostly because I can’t walk long distances and the grocery stores are huge but I decided this morning to do this —So I flufffed out my tutu, grabbed my cane and drove myself to the grocery store, partner in crime in tow.  We also made a stop at Home Depot and Target.  You can’t leave the house without going to Target, it seems.So, we did our usual thing and each got a basket, walked the store and picked up what we needed/wanted and met at the checkout.  That was when it got slightly hellish — There was one regular checker.  There were two people in line each pushing a basket with roughly half the items in the store in each. We discussed going through the self check but I had a little bit of produce and I hate weighing the produce and trying to look it up and all that but the one checker line was going VERY slowly so we bit the bullet and went to the self check which was full and we still had to stand in line.  We were checking along and it was glitching every couple of items and the machine kept saying “help is on the way” and I didn’t know why I needed help and the lady who was clearly the “help” was dealing with everybody else whose machines weren’t working and she finally got to me and upon checking my scanning she informed me that garlic was sold by the piece not by the pound and that was why the machine glitched and I couldn’t scan my pork chops. Well, alrighty. I just smiled and said I was reminded why I hated going to the grocery store but in my mind, this ——So, we managed to get done without me embarrassing both of us or having Ft. W’s finest called.  We arrived at home, I was not in excrutiating pain from walking, I can actually say I enjoyed the shopping process up until the checking out process, and I am trying to figure out which day of the week is the best, crowd wise, for grocery shopping.  I thought being very early Sunday morning would be great, few people, leisurely shopping, maybe a Starbucks, some flowers — well, anyway, I was wrong — perhaps a Tuesday?  I read years ago that Tuesday is the best day to go to the mall….nobody goes to the mall on Tuesdays.  Of course nobody goes to the mall at all anymore but I digress.So, that was my first example of determination — determined to not be defined by my arthritis, determined to make myself enjoy things and not give in or give up — shouldn’t be THAT hard as I am a tough old bird.  What is next on my plan?  Hahaha, funny you should ask.  The dog is going for a walk, with me, outside, in the street, on a very short leash.  I have tried to take her for a walk once, in the street, and it didn’t go well.  I am going to try again.  I know she is bored and I am not a good dog playmate so she needs some sort of stimulation.  Who knows, maybe if we go late enough she will encounter one of the foxes.  That should be interesting!  I will let you know."},

{"title": "Stewardship Dinner", "date": "Thursday, October 05, 2023", "text": "As I mentioned yesterday, our church has an annual dinner for fellowship and to discuss stewardship for the year.  It is held at a well-known Mexican restaurant called Joe T. Garcia’s.  The main restaurant started as a small house and was expanded over the years to include larger dining rooms and a huge, well planted garden — very impressive.  The photos are all copyrighted and I didn’t get pics of the garden so here is the website if you are curious.  http://www.joetgarcias.com/The restaurant also acquired a small building, I think maybe an old church, across the street that they call “La Puertita” — the Chapel.  This venue is used for special events — quite popular with the wedding crowd.  I am not familiar with the origin of this building but it has been there the whole time we have lived here which is 33 years.  It is really a nice place and I have been there before for DAR events.We were supposed to have the dinner outside on the patio in the garden but the threat of rain turned us inside.  I was sort of happy about it because the mosquitos have been eating me alive and I really don’t care for mosquito repellant.  I did take a couple of photos of the interior to share — so here it is — La Puertita — and foodIt was lovely, albeit noisy, and we managed to have our dinner/fellowship before the rain hit! It was a good night."},
{"title": "Self Care — Advocating for Yourself", "date": "Wednesday, October 04, 2023", "text": "Advocating for myself is something I am just now learning to do at my ripe old age.  I am learning to say no or, if I say yes, it is on my terms.  I came from a mother who just gave herself away to other people until there was nothing left to give.  She passed at my current age and if she had been a little more into self care I might have her still, she might know my grandchildren.  But that isn’t what happened. I am not going to let history repeat itself.I think I have fibromyalgia and have been doing lots of reading about it.  I know I have anxiety — some days worst than others — and I know that I have to do what it takes to not let it get the best of me.  So, between the anxiety and the pain and the fatigue, I have to take care of me first so I can take care of others.For a long time, putting myself first has felt indulgent and I have suffered guilt — I seem to have surpassed that now though, which sort of surprises me.  But, I feel like I have earned the right to say no.  I have taken care of lots of people through lots of things and now it is time to take care of me.  I have been hurt by people, family members, and nobody came to my defense so I am coming to my own defense now.  If it offends, so be it.  Tonight is our annual church dinner at a local, well known Mexican restaurant, Joe T Garcia’s.  It is a time of fun and fellowship and I look forward to it.  I have already done  my beauty caretaking in anticipation of the event (haha, that means I washed my hair!) and am ready to go.  I guess my fragrance for this evening will be mosquito repellant because we seem to be growing a bumper crop here at the beginning of fall and this restaurant has an outdoor patio with LOTS of plants. So, yeah.It will be a fun evening and I think the weather will be good, we are supposed to have a cold front (Texas style) come through with rain so hopefully we won’t get rained out.I will try to take some photos to share — all the ones I found online are copyrighted so I guess I will just have to do it myself.  Like they say — if you want something done right, yada yada yada…."},
{"title": "Needlework, needle craft, needle art — whatever you want to call it — ", "date": "Saturday, September 30, 2023", "text": "I was very fortunate to have known one of my great-grandmothers.  She was born in 1875 and lived until 1978.  She was alive for my birth and for my first child’s birth.  She was a much beloved member of my father’s family, a true matriarch.  She was resourceful.  She always had plants growing — mostly in old coffee cans — on her front porch, she sewed, knitted, crocheted and quilted.  She cooked a lot because during the depression and during World War II her home was the gathering place — they would share their ration cards and make it work.  In about 1935 her husband, seen with her above, up and died.  So, what did my resourceful great grandma do?  She turned her little white Victorian house into a boarding house and went to work in the school cafeteria.  She made it work.When I was young and my dad worked at night we would walk (just around the corner) to her house to visit.  My mother really did like her grandmother in law.  So one night we took our little after dinner walk to Granny’s house and found her piecing a quilt.I was fascinated.She and my grandmother were piecing squares about l”, maybe l.5” in just a grid and I wanted to do it so badly, it was absolutely mesmerizing to me.  So Granny dug around in her stash bag and gave me some of the squares and a needle and thread.  My mother was horrified.  I was probably just 5.  She just couldn’t imagine me with something as dangerous as a needle — my Granny just laughed — she was a pioneer child after all and not at all surprised by a 5 year old with a needle in her hand.I sewed my squares together with huge stitches and was so proud.  She asked if I was done.  I said no it wasn’t quite finished.  So, I rummaged around in the drawer of her treadle sewing machine and found some rick-rack and a little jingle bell.  I sewed the rick rack around the edge and the jingle bell to one corner.  There! It was done!  My first quilt square.  The first of many.  I kept that square for long time and then somehow it disappeared.  I still wish I had it.My mother introduced me to embroidery.  She bought some muslin cup towels, an iron on design — it was kittens doing daily chores — and created the towel for me to embroidery.  I loved it.  I never finished it.  It was truly a hot mess.  I can’t show you photos of that either because they disappeared as well — too many moves, a fire, a minimalist mother who liked to “clear the clutter”.  Oh well.  Then I took up needlepoint.  I enjoyed it but not as much as the genre I settled on — cross stitch.  I absolutely love cross stitch.  I do it just for the love of doing it with no plan to “use” it.  Due to my broken arm I had to stop the project I was working on and put it all away.  Recently I was browsing the subject on Pinterest and noticed the trend toward framing cross stitch projects in hoops.  I loved the look, the ease and the price!I have a really dismal stairwell so I though that would be a great way to display the work I had done.  I really like small things and I like the way the wall is looking.  I still have more to do but I have made a start — I have added more since this photo was taken — I am hanging them on wooden thumb tacks so I don’t make huge holes in the wall — goodness knows I wouldn’t want to destroy all that blah beigeness! Anyway, nobody goes up there but us and it is sort of fun to look at the small pictures. The one in the brown frame I did for my mom, and one for my aunt, for Christmas because they collected thimbles.  The little blue mitten was purchased from a Ukrainian stitcher at the beginning of the war — selling her patterns was the way she was still able to make a living.  The piece right above the light switch is St. Louis Cathedral — I purchased the pattern during a visit to New Orleans.  I have more pieces from other places and will get them all framed eventually — I have already bought the hoops!So, anyway, that is my take on needle art, or work, or craft or whatever you want to call it."},
{"title": "There’s Always Room For …… Books!", "date": "Friday, September 29, 2023", "text": "Ok, my title isn’t exactly accurate.  I have bookcases all over my house, all filled to the brim, and that is why I read on a device and use a service like Kindle Unlimited so that I don’t have to find more book space.  But, with that said, I love books and with the impending autumn season (I assume it will get here eventually) I really miss browsing the bookstores for the newest, or maybe the oldest, read available.I was thinking about my reading habits and history and I remember being a very young child watching my mother read the newspaper and asking what it felt like to be able to read.  I wanted to so badly.  Then I went to kindergarten and they taught us to read using those little Dick and Jane readers.  I was in heaven.  Then I went to first grade and those that didn’t go to kindergarten (wasn’t required in the 50’s) were learning to read using those same readers. Of course, I had already done it so I was bored.  Here is a photo of one of the readers but I seem to remember them being soft covered but I might be wrong, it has been over 60 years ago!My mother would buy me books from the neighborhood toy store, Ann and Tom Brown Toys, and subscribe to book clubs so we always had books in the house as she and my father were readers as well. However, when I was in the 3rd grade I was introduced to the public library.  We had our end of school picnic at a historic park in San Antonio and, if we had a willing parent with us, we could go to the library that sat in the park and get a library card.  Well, I did have a willing parent and I did get my first library card!  This is the library — it still stands and it is still operational.I have other photos of it, I just can’t find them, of course, but it was a lovely library and I still remember the children’s section — full of Lois Lenski, Kate Seredy, Laura Ingalls Wilder, etc. One of my fondest memories — remember I am an introvert — is going to the library, coming home and curling up on the couch and reading for hours, listening to the rain (it rained a lot in San Antonio in the fall) and feeling so cozy.  When I was about eleven or so I found my greatest pasttime during the long summers was reading.  I had a pool and a neighborhood full of boys but I spent many hours holding a book.  I learned early on to pick a BIG book to get me through the summer.  I think the first I read was “From Here to Eternity”.  I had just seen the Frank Sinatra movie, was totally in love, and figured that was a great place to start.  Several more followed — Gone With the Wind, Marjorie Morningstar, To Kill a Mockingbird — yes, I know, heavy reading for a 12 year old but there was lighthearted stuff too — when I was about 13 I discovered the Gidget books, based on the movies.  My mother let me read the heavy handed stuff with no problem but let the light hearted, coming of age material come into our house and there were red flags all over the place!  And then, I read The Diary of Anne Frank and it changed my view of the world and the people in it.Around the same time, 7th grade actually, I had to do a report on a famous Texas historical figure.  We didn’t have chain bookstores then but we did have a couple of indie stores, one being Rosengrens —We also had another but I can’t remember the name — it was a little store in a little house and I am happy to report that it is still standing although it looks different.  It used to be white with a green door and a tinkly bell.  I purchased a book on William B Travis and I still have the book.A lot has changed since those innocent summers of the middle of the last century.  We have seen a lot happen, most of it not good, I have aged and become even more intolerant of the world around me so my reading has changed a bit.I tend to read a lot of series stuff — one of my favorite authors is Hope Callaghan.  Two of her series — Made in Savannah and Garden Girls are my go-to’s for cozy mysteries.  I started the Made in Savannah series after a vacation to Savannah, Georgia and I was totally awestruck by the town.And the Garden Girls mysteries I started reading because the ladies aren’t too different in age than myself although I am aging faster!I assume my interest in “serials” is due to early reads like Nancy Drew and The Bobbsey Twins — speaking of, I am going to start the Nancy Drew series again soon.  I am currently reading the latest offering in the Made in Savannah series — “A Pirates Wife in Savannah’.  It is fun and funny — due mostly to the character of Elvira — but I will let you read it yourself to judge and, in the case of Elvira, I think it is ok to be judgey.When I finish with this book I will have read all in the series —-21 maybe? - and I highly recommend if you like light reading like I do.  I am afraid my heavy reading days are over, I don’t really buy “BIG” books anymore although I did read “The House at Riverton” by Kate Morton which I thoroughly enjoyed.  However, if it wasn’t on my kindle I wouldn’t have been able to read it because I can’t hold the big books in my poor arthritic hands anymore!  But, I do have a couple of more of Morton’s books on my “to read” list so I will get to them eventually — on a device.So, that is my thoughts on reading.  I love it, I recommend it, I enjoy all genre’s (well, maybe not military history!) but it is truly a pasttime worth pursuing.  Tomorrow — needlearts."},
{"title": "Trees", "date": "Thursday, September 28, 2023", "text": "A blog friend, Billlie Jo, shared the poem “Trees” in my comments yesterday about poetry.  It is a lovely poem, one of my favorites, but then I have a “thing” for trees.I have always loved trees, I never knew why, now as I am older and more knowledgeable of my family history I think it might have to do with my Celtic heritage — oak trees, you know, are quite important to Celtic lore.But, whatever, the reason I have always been attracted to trees.  I love to watch the colors change in the autumn - and even now some of the trees are turning golden.  Those of us who live here know it is not the changing season but rather the intense heat we have had but it paints a lovely picture nonetheless.I have commented in the past about how I would love to be able to draw — this is not a long reaching goal, I have only come to this realization in the last few years.  When I was in school it never occurred to me to take an art class but now, with a view that hindsite often give us, I wish I had.  And one of the things I would love to be able to draw is — yes, you guessed it — a tree. This is an attempt from a few years ago — clearly I am not siting straight — or maybe it is a tree that experiences a lot of wind and has become leaning.   It looks like an autumn tree to me — no leaves and a bit spooky.  Perhaps I should add a pumpkin or a squirrel?  Hmm.. I don’t know but I do know that I will continue to try until I produce a tree that is pleasing to MY eye and actually looks like a tree.I discovered the photo above on Pinterest a few days back — it contained several of my favorite elements — a tree, a fox and the moon.  I also liked the sentiment, very comforting for those days that are just “too much”And how about this one?  Such a cozy little Hobbit type house — maybe a new style of “tiny” house? I wonder how that would rent out as an airbnb?  Probably popular.And here is the giant oak tree in our back yard.  It is quite old and very large — it feeds the squirrels with its acorns and is the home to a red headed woodpecker.  It provides shade as well feeding into my tree “thing” — it was one of the perks of buying this house.  So,  yes, trees — we need them in our lives == what would life be without our trees?  Do you have a favorite?"},

{"title": "MyFitnessPal — is it Really My Pal?", "date": "Wednesday, September 20, 2023", "text": "My daughter is starting on a weight loss journey today.  She has had a rapid weight gain, in the last four years or so, and it is causing her problems.  Two of her doctors feel it is medication induced, have changed or removed the meds and now she is on a PLAN.I have as much weight to lose as she does and I am very sedentary.  So, I have decided to join her on her journey.  We had a long conversation last night about all the methods and I still say that journaling food, weighing, measuring and counting calories is the best way — a bit of mood tracking as well to see when our most weak times are, just getting a picture of what we are actually eating, when and why.  BUT…both of us feel that food journaling is the spawn of the devil.  The first day is fine, after that it is just a chore.  But, we have decided this will be our method.  I prefer a journal/pen and she prefers MyFitnessPal.  There are advantages to both, if you will.The journal/pen method lets you keep notes about when you eat, why and just adding in a mood/enviornmental factor.  The downside you have to look up all the food in a calorie counter, online, or on the product itself.  That takes a lot more time than I am  willing to give.  Do I have the time?  Yes.  Is that how I want to spend it?  No. So…..MyFitnessPal does have some distinct advantages.  One, you put it on your phone and/or iPad (I have it on both) so you have your method of tracking with you at most times.  It has most of the items you eat in the database so looking up info is a lot less necessary.  It also breaks down what you eat into viewable components of fats, protein, and carbs.  It also shows you the micronutrients you ingest.  It is a nice little tool to see all the good and bad you are doing in a day.  It is boring.  But, it seems to be a necessary evil.We are also walking 30 minutes a day.  That will be a lot easier for the daughter than me.  She teaches school which means she is on her feet all the time anyway and she has a giant dog that requires walking.  She also has a Tony Little Gazelle at home so I don’t think the 30 minutes a day is going to be an issue for her.  For me? Ha! Quite another story.  This sounds ridiculous but I am afraid I am going to have to break it up in segments — possibly 10 minutes at a time.  I am dangerously sedentary because of my knees and this is going to take some work on my part and I am a bit ambivalent about it but I am going to give it a go because we are in this together!So, I spoke to my partner in crime this morning and she is not thrilled about the whole thing which I can so totally understand.  I am very meh about it myself but I know that if I don’t lose the weight I am not going to be able to walk.  She is staring down a family history of diabetes and I am staring down a family history of arthritis, neither of which we want.  So, off we go.But, I am sending her this to cheer her up — granted, she prefers Snoopy and Winnie the Pooh but this cute little furry is just going to have to do.So, wish us luck.  I think we are gonna need it!"},
{"title": "Fake Fall — Second Summer", "date": "Tuesday, September 19, 2023", "text": "I grew up in South Texas where the weather was very tropical (aka humid).  We had hot summers and mild winters (except for 1985).  We didn’t start to school until the first Monday after Labor Day and by then we were glad to dress up in our little plaid dresses, cardigans and saddle oxfords.  I didn’t wear ankle straps like these young ladies, well, at least not to schoolOn Halloween, without fail, we would have our first “blue norther”.  We would all come home from school, hot and sweaty and very excited.  We would don those dreadful plastic Halloween costumes and head out to Trick or Treat for candy our mother’s never really let us eat.  Of course, back then we didn’t have daylight savings time so it got dark and by 8 pm we were home and ready for bed but, before we got home the weather turned and the wind picked up and was howling like crazy and we were cold.  It was the perfect spooky way to end Halloween.  At that point, it was autumn and no messing around with the temps.In 1990 we moved to North Texas and I was excited for what I figured would be four seasons.  I was wrong.  Our neighbor told us that we could expect ice almost every year and snow about every three.  I didn’t realize, however, how it would come about.The second year we were here we had an ice storm on Thanksgiving and I was up cooking and I just kept cooking and my mother kept saying she didn’t think we were going to be able to get together and I just kept cooking but, at the end of the day, we cancelled Thanksgiving and that was a real disappointment.  We noticed that it was summer until mid September and then it turned fall for about a couple of weeks and then it was summer again.  I like to call that Fake Fall and Second Summer.  In October we generally have Real Fall for a couple of weeks but that is as long as it lasts — then it is winter.  No “Fake” about it.  Some years it is milder but we always have at least one ice storm and sometimes snow.  The weather here is very jarring— in San Antonio we have mild winters - here mild is not a word I would use.  In San Antonio summer is hot but you have lovely breezes off the Gulf of Mexico to cool things off —here, well, this year we had over 50 days of triple digit temps going up to 110.  And no gulf breezes.  So, right now we are in Fake Fall but in a couple of days we will see Second Summer —and then it will start turning seasonally colder.  I would love to see all the fall decor on peoples front porches — here people like to decorate porches — but it doesn’t seem like people are in the mood — I think because it has been so hot but, if this year is like the last they need to hurry because when it gets here it will only last a little while and then the winter decor has to come out!  I think that is why I don’t do it — for the cost of it you can’t keep it out long.  I will be glad when Second Summer passes and we get a feel for Real Fall in the air — I love seeing the trees change colors and feel the nip in the air.  But, until then I will just share this —Have a wonderful Tuesday!  Ah, yes, Taco Tuesday!"},

{"title": "Cooking, Crockpots and an Apology", "date": "Saturday, September 16, 2023", "text": "I must apologize for my mini rant of yesterday.  It started out as a convo about intuitive eating and then took a completely different turn and for that I am sorry.  Things, meaning me, aren’t nearly as dire as that post would have somebody believe so believe me when I tell you I am fine, I don’t hang on to things for very long and I am determined to fight the cookie battle for as long as it takes! Just call me Elsa!But, in thinking about intuitive eating one has to think about cooking.  We tend to eat our main meal at noon which, I don’t know about you, is difficult for me because I have to think about it, plan it and almost cook it the day before.  And for a husband that doesn’t like leftovers — sheer agony! Haha! I exaggerate but cooking for lunch is totally different than cooking an evening meal in terms of prep time. So, that is a mental challenge.Which brings me to the next thing - crockpots!  Yes, the old workhorse of the 70’s.  I had a great one that you could remove the liner and actually use it to brown on the stove.  Well, I used it until it just up and died one day and had to be replaced.  So I bought a regular, round shaped unit with a removable liner and it has been a staple in my kitchen as well.  However, I tend to cook pork tenderloins and chicken breasts a lot and those things just dont fit into a round vessel very well so a couple of days ago I did a quick amazon run and ordered this — an oval model.It isn’t fancy, totally manual, no programming, just warm, high, and low — I think I can manage that.  So, it was to be delivered yesterday.  I already had my tenderloin out of the freezer thawing in the fridge ready to put it on last night, on low, so it would be ready for today.  Hmmmm……The crockpot didn’t arrive.  It is late.  So, moving on to plan B — the actual oven.I am really lucky that we are in the middle of Fake Fall here and the temps are really nice so heating the oven won’t make the house really hot. So, it is all good but I was really looking forward to trying my new appliance.  Oh well, tomorrow is another day.I am also going to defrost some chicken thighs for some chicken and rice soup.  Fake Fall has me in the mood for some nice soup — and it is something we can have for more than just one meal.  So is the tenderloin, actually.  We always have a good amount left so I am going to make sandwiches in the next couple of days.A few years ago we moved to where we are now and I took that opportunity to cull some kitchen items.  Two of those being bread makers.   I had one and I inherited one from my mother in law — almost new but without a user manual.  I decided to pass them on because I really liked the process of making bread myself and my mixer was great for kneading.  However, last Christmas I found a unit that was smaller, more compact, and was easy to move around so I bought it.  I have yet to make any bread.  That might happen today, to go along with the soup.  My husband is on a diet prescribed to him by his diabetes doctor and he really isn’t supposed to eat a lot of white bread but if I dole it out and not let him go crazy with it it should be ok once in a while.I have added something new to my morning routine.  My morning routing usually consists of things like, do skincare, do dog care, make the bed, say prayers, eat breakfast — you get the picture, the usual stuff — but today I have added something new.  I know I don’t drink enough water throughout the day so I added a large glass of water with lemon before I have breakfast.  Not cold water, not hot water, just tap water and it is very refreshing.  Hopefully I can keep that up and not go straight for the coffee! I am also going to try to clip the dog.  Yikes! Wish me luck.  I have done small amounts of grooming things to her but never a full on groom but she is getting matted and looks like a bear.  I refuse to take her back to the groomer that she has gone to since we got her because the last two times she has gone she has been injured.  This was never an issue when it was just two girls running the place but they have hired a guy that has tended to Trixie since he came and both times she has been hurt so, I am moving on.  I am seriously thinking about hiring the Petco mobile groomer to just come to me and see how that goes.  But, for today, I am going to give it a go.  Hopefully we can get her clipped a little bit all over before she gets bored and decided to move on.  I will let you know!So, off to have have breakfast and get started on the day.  Hopefully the crock pot will show up sometime today but it will be too late to make the tenderloin but not too late to make the soup!  Can’t wait!"},
{"title": "It’s a Weighty issue — See What I Did There?", "date": "Friday, September 15, 2023", "text": "Yes, weighty, indeed.  Hi, my name is Melissa and I have an eating disorder. -And this is about the age it started.  BTW, this photo always reminds me of myself and my cousin Joy.  It is SO us!I digress.When I was little I was cute. Sounds egotistical but it is true.  However, as I grew and changed as we all do, I lost a lot of that cuteness.  My mother was a tiny thing -5’1”, 105 lbs, 22 inch waist, size 5 shoes.  I bypassed that when I was about 10.  At age 12 I was 5’5”, 125 lbs. and wore a 6.5 shoe.  That was when I quit growing.  My mother had a great figure, narrow hips, ample chest and a tiny waist.  Me? Yeah, not so much.  I was very much aware at the time that my mother was the desired silhouette and I was just sort of moo-like.  I had a short torso, with a high waist, long skinny arms and legs and I couldn’t get my tummy flat to save my life.  I was developing a rather low self esteem about that time which would never right itself to this day.  When I was with my mother I just felt so, well, big and clumsy and unattractive.About the age of 12 I was aware of hearing things like “you don’t need another hot dog, if you don’t quit eating you will be the size of a house”.  But, if I was upset over something, out came the comfort food - there isn’t anything in the world that cookies and soda can’t fix — well, except the result of the cookies and soda.When I was in college I took a dance class (I always danced) that was half Pilates.  My little body was so toned and lean that I didn’t recognize myself in the mirror in the dressing room at the school gym.  I maintained it until after I had my first child.  Then….excuse my French …. All hell broke loose.  The stresses off life and having a small child rained down upon me like a south Texas gully washer.  And how did I cope.  Yep, I went back to the good ol’ cookies/soda routine.  And I added ice cream.  I was on a mission that didn’t work.  I was just getting fatter and my problems weren’t going away.  The years went by, the problems got bigger, my husband traveled a lot in his job and that took him far away for long periods of time, my children grew into teenage hood with all the good stuff that goes along with that (although nothing serious like drugs or alcohol, just grades and school activities, etc., terrible boyfriends, no girl friends, etc.), both of my parents became terminally ill and died.  Just one thing after another and as my aunt used to say “if it’s not one damn thing, it’s another”.  And it just kept coming.So, now, with my children grown, my husband retired and having a number of health issues, my parents gone I have lots of time to sit and think about myself.  Here I am, overweight, all my joints being affected —- we have a strong family history of arthritis which clearly I inherited and I also come from short, roly poly people which I also inherited and nurtured (my bad) and totally anxiety ridden.  So, what’s a girl to do?Well, I have done a lot of soul searching and self realization and I have come to conclusions.  My mother liked me when I was little and cute but as I grew and changed and looked more like my dad’s family than hers, when I didn’t excel in school, when I didn’t want to be a cheerleader or pep squad minion, when I didn’t finish college (that is a whole other story! NOT MY FAULT) I think I have realized that I was just a big disappointment to her.  I am not even sure she liked me.  I have noticed that there were loads of photos of me until about first grade and suddenly there were very few photos of me.  I was very sheltered and not allowed to do things that other kids could do (like after school clubs at school, summer jobs, etc) but then I always felt she was disappointed that I didn’t do the “performance” things and make her proud.  I remember when I was in high school, my mother getting upset over something (can’t remember what) and saying “I just don’t know why you can’t be more like J”.  Well, that stung.The last thing I remember my mother saying to me as she lay dying was “I wish I could live long enough to see you lose all that weight”.   Well, she didn’t.I don’t think it takes a trained psychiatrist/psychologist to see where the problem lies.So, what to do about it.  Mom’s dead, can’t talk to her about it so the only thing to do is accept it, hope I am wrong in my feelings, and move on.Moving on is hard.  How?  I have done WW, I have done calorie counting where I weighed and measured all my food, I have cut carbs, I have tried intermittent fasting,  I have exercised to burn calories and wouldn’t quit until I burned off everything I had eaten in a day.  Now, if this isn’t an eating disorder, I don’t know what is.So, I have been looking into intuitive eating.  It is supposed to help with this sort of thing — an unhealthy relationship with food.  It involves eating when you are hungry, stopping when you are full, not eliminating anything from your diet, going with the idea that you might not lose weight but could gain some.  My plan is looking like this — NOTHING IS OFF LIMITS! Even the cookies.  I quit drinking soda years ago and really crave water so there is that.  NO JOURNALING! Every time I think about journaling my food I have a physical reaction.  NO WEIGHING OR MEASURING!  I have done this enough that I know what a half cup of something looks like.  I know what a portion is.  THREE MEALS A DAY —possibly a snack.  My problem time is between lunch and dinner so that is my focus.  I think I just need to plan a snack and get on with it instead of trying to power through. I am going to use the intuitive eating premise that you eat when you are hungry and eat until you are full — part of the understanding here is that you are making good choices — your meal evenly weighted between protein/fats/carbs.  Heavy on veg.  Nobody got fat eating yellow squash.  I have been at it for a few days and I can say I feel a bit more relaxed.  It feels strange to sit down to a meal and just eat, not thinking to leave something on the plate that I “shouldn’t” have — it does take some courage.  A couple of times I have felt like I am eating poison — but it was really just beans.  Oh, how messed up I am!So, yeah, sorry for the rant.  You know, after my mother died I completely expected to dream about her at some point but I never have.  I think I know why. I think I have unresolved “Mommy” issues that I didn’t realize, until the last six months, that I have.  I have dreamed about my father several times, what I figure were visitation dreams but never my mom.  I think somewhere deep down I felt that I was just not the child she wanted or thought she would have.  I don’t know that I could have fixed that even if I had known and I hope I am wrong. However, after all this soul searching I have a feeling of acceptance.  I think it is helping with the anxiety as well.  Do I need therapy?  Oh, probably but I would rather buy clothes, even if they are plus size, and makeup and books.  I would rather pray over it and just deal with it.  Could a therapist help?  I don’t know, he/she couldn’t change it, I think just realizing that my mother wasn’t being a “bad mother” but she made some mistakes like we all do is enough.  She made some mistakes but I don’t have to continue living it — if I do that is my mistake.  So, yeah, sorry to be so heavy and icky today but just wanted to share the weight thing. I will leave  you with this"},
{"title": "The Magic of Routine", "date": "Wednesday, September 13, 2023", "text": "When I was wee one, I had a magnificent internal clock.  My eyes flew open at 6:30 a.m and my face fell flat asleep at 9 pm regardless of where I was.  The things of life — school, dates, children, etc.,  — messed with my internal clock to the point that I was always tired.  And hungry.So, awhile back when I was analyzing my anxiety issues it occurred to me that some of the problem might be me fighting my natural self.  I seriously thought about if I really needed to sit up and watch the 10 p.m. news/weather - I mean, seriously, in a day how much changes between the 6 pm news and the 10 pm news.  Oh, my husband LOVES the news, by the way.   As it turns out, if I indulge myself and put my needs first, my face still falls asleep at 9 pm and I wake up at 6:30.  Some things never change.When I received the journal in the mail that I was going to use for my anxiety adventure, the first thing I did was make a daily routine.  Now, mind you, it was really BASIC — like, get up, make the bed, wash face….you get the picture.I realized then how far I had strayed from a routine.  Back when my kids were little and my husband was working, there was a flow — things to be done, a timeline to the day and requirements like laundry HAD to be done or there were no clean uniforms and I was not sending my children to school in reworn uniforms.  Then came the sudden and unanticipated retirement — thank you corporate restructuring — no cake, barely a nod for all the years put in but that is another story — I figured it wouldn’t affect my daily routine which had already changed significantly when the children dared to grow up and move out.  But, change it did. And I thing this change has contributed to my anxiety.So, here we are both older and less physically fit and me worrying about everything I can imagine so what do I do?  I make a list.  In my journal.  And I check things off.  I have developed a nice little morning routine which I have been keeping up consistently.  I have even added a few things to it because I have been looking for the proper time of day to do things - I know that sounds mysterious and cryptic.  Basically I have been looking for the time of day to take a shower that really suits my natural routine.  Seems that is about 6:30 in the morning.  It is working out beautifully.I am better at doing things in the morning.  Once lunch rolls around I am pretty much done.  So I tried to get the “stuff” done early which is hard since I have a too-big house but I don’t try to get it all done at once.  I have a list of things to do on the daily and then I spread the stuff out over the month.  I have two guest rooms that don’t get used so they only get cleaned once a month, unless somebody is coming.  I have been taking the time to clean out and declutter lots of stuff, one whole end of my house is decluttered and I feel so accomplished.  Now if I could just bring myself to get rid of all the magazines I would be golden.So, what does any of this have to do with my anxiety issues?  Well, let me tell you.  I have something — the journal and the list — to focus on.  I have found that if I stay busy I will have less anxiety, not so much time to sit around and think about any and all things to worry about! I also feel a bit like my younger self, not so dottering and old and more like I am capable of keeping up.  And I am finding out that if I write down when I am anxious and what is going on at the time I can pretty well identify where my anxiety comes from.And…the journal and the list makes me feel like I am in control of things and my intrusive thoughts — I can talk myself out of thinking weird and wild things (like is that loud plane going to explode over my house) and once I write it down, it goes away.So, keeping the journal, delving into self care a lot and having a to-do list has made all the difference in the world — I get up in the morning and know my list is there and what I need to do, I stay on top of things and I feel accomplished and useful and THAT is the magic of routine."},

{"title": "The Trixster", "date": "Thursday, September 07, 2023", "text": "Four years ago I decided I needed a new dog.  I hadn’t had one for about 14 years, swearing after I lost Tessie that I wouldn’t have anymore.  However, for some reason, I decided to adopt a little Yorkie from a breeder in a nearby town.  She brought the babe to me, we met at a Petsmart to visit and I came home with a little five month old ball of fuzz.Four years later finds me with this little monster!You can barely see her because she is deep in a nap curled up next to her pillows.The breeder told me, when I contacted her about the litter, that this one (called Miss Suzy Q) would probably top out at about 8 lbs.  She was tracking to be larger.  And I changed her name to Trixie.Hmmm.Last visit to the vet had her at almost 18 lb.  They don’t call her a “toy” breed anymore, they don’t even call her a “small” dog anymore — she is a medium dog and I had to buy her a new harness because she outgrew her old one.  She is almost 20” around her chest.  She has to wear a “medium” in clothing.Also, her ears won’t stand up.  They are flop ears.  Honestly she looks more like a bear than a Yorkie.  But, we love her.I am her groomer these days because her last visit to the groomer she has always gone to found her with a really severe case of razor burn and her neck cut.  I don’t care if she does look like a bear, I am not going to pay $100/month to have her injured.  So, that is one more hat I am wearing.Trixie is the most out of spec pure bred dog I have ever seen.But, we love her.Here are some more pics of the little (ok, not little) hot mess — she’s just a baby! I read a headline on google this morning that the first real cold front is coming to Texas next week! We will see! That probably means temps in the mid 90’s which is laughable but I will take it.  I have felt a detectable change in the air the last couple of mornings but nothing significant yet.The spooky season is upon us and the Target discount section is chock full of goodies.  I managed to not buy anything yesterday which is good — I am not great with seasonal decor — but my daughter is doing a good job of tiny vignettes all around her house.  Just enough to be festive but not enough to make you read minimalists inspiration articles.  I might chose a spot and do something.  Maybe.I did manage to drag myself upstairs yesterday to retrieve my cross stitch bag.  I had been working on the piece I bought in Williamsburg, the Governors Palace, and I thought I had lost the pattern but I found it and all the thread and I am ready to commence work on it.  It is a lovely pattern, bright colors, and not too large but it is a small count fabric which gives my eyes a workout but I have my special light and magnifiers so I am good to go.  I can’t wait to get started.  Here is a photo of the work in progress —I know, hard to see much but wrinkled fabric however maybe soon it will be more impressive.  Time will tell.I have been wanting to get back into sketching.  I am by no means an artist but it is a stress reliever.  I like to doodle — small little things.  I used this doodle as my cover photo for, ugh, Facebook.A friend of mine, who was a friend of my Dad’s, showed me how to improve on it  The guy’s name is Sam and he spent time with my artist father when he was a teenager and now he is an artist of merit on his own.  I think I might have a tutor!! I sure could use one.I am going to work on this today and see if I can improve it — It doesn’t look like it would take too much.I have been on Pinterest quite a bit and I love looking at all the things they have to offer for my viewing pleasure.  I especially love the needle felted critters.  Such talent and patience.  I don’t have either. But they are lovely.Today we have a doctors appointment downtown so that will take a good portion of the day.  Then we have to tend to Grandpuppy Olive.  We go over occasionally and play and today is a play day.  She loves us and we love her.  Trixie, however, doesn’t love her! I need to work on that.Still reading “The Beach House at Amelia Island”.  It is going much faster than my last read and is fairly engaging.  However, it needs to pick up the pace a bit, so far the narrative has barely taken us out of a hospital room and I am almost half done!  It will get better I am sure.So, that is ist for this Thursday morning.  I am up early with ice on my gimpy knee.  I have been icing lately and it is helpful.  So have a wonderful day!

{"title": "Coming to Terms", "date": "Wednesday, September 06, 2023", "text": "The Facebook hijacking has left me frazzled.  It shouldn’t have affected me as much as it did but it did.  There is nothing I can do about it, I have lost control of my main page and the two groups I administrated. I feel violated and robbed.  I have reported it to all the proper authorities and there is nothing left to do but rebuild a new account which I am doing.  I am doing it very slowly as well.  Some of my friends I can’t get back and it is making me sad.  Maybe Facebook was too big a part of my day.Thinking about it I realized that is wasn’t the people or content that was the draw for me but rather the scrolling — scrolling through pages and pages of content, most of it meaningless, just to have something to do, a time suck if you will.  That can’t be healthy.  I mean, losing it left me in a bit of a muddle.  I abandoned my anxiety journal for a few days which is what kept me on track, it made me feel isolated and lost neither of which I truly am.  So, in a way, getting hacked was a wake up call — priorities, Melissa, priorities.So, in the meantime I reconnected with Pinterest — I am able to scroll there and see all sorts of beautiful and uplifting things.  I have become reconnected with my blog and have even found some new blogs to follow.  Am I isolated?  No, because I have all my “old” bloggy friends (Granny Marigold and Mary!!) to chat with and it is comforting.  What is disturbing is how much energy and attention is put on social media but we are social creatures, aren’t we?  And social media sites are just a very convenient way to fuel that need, especially in troubled times like covid.  Well, that is all fine and good but I think it needs to be kept in perspective.  I will be paying more attention to my blog now and my anxiety journal and I am simply loving Pinterest right now.  It is  spurring me on to gather my cross stitch supplies and start again, and my drawing pencils and start some sketches.  Who knows, I might even begin card making again — there are so many great cards out there!So, while the hijacking might have seemed earth shattering at the time, right now it seems like sort of a blessing in disguise.  We just never know, do we?"},

{"title": "Family History — Surprises", "date": "Sunday, September 03, 2023", "text": "I was raised in a family that valued knowing it’s roots.  My father’s family were great genealogists and the family tree was well established.  My mother’s family not so much. It was about the time that my mother became ill that she started asking me to delve into her genealogy, she would like to know more.  Her parents were not talkers and didn’t share a lot about their younger years so she didn’t have a lot of information.  Her mother laid claim to be “Scotch Irish and French Indian” and her father’s family hailed from Wales — he was, in fact, a first generation American.  Because of the uniqueness of my grandfather being from “recent” immigrants I started with his family. I even ordered a telephone directory from Wales, went to the library and copied names of possible relatives from a Scranton telephone directory and wrote letters because there was no internet.  The effort was laborious and sometimes fruitful and sometimes not but the advent of the internet made it all much bettter.I am still working on that side of my tree but as a natural progression, I have moved on to my grandmother’s side.  The whole “Scotch Irish French Indian” thing is proving to be somewhat correct but not completely.  It is all complicated by the lack of certain documentation to be helpful in guiding me through a maze of people all bearing the same name.  Whoever knew that “Isham” would be such a popular name and better yet, who looks a beautiful baby boy and says “you look like an Isham”?  You say “Isham” to me, all I see is Popeye.  Anyway, I digress.The one thing I have always been very curious about is my grandmother’s claim of indigenious person ancestors.  That is one thing, however, that seems to be correct. Her grandmother, who I was lucky enough to find photos of, certainly does look the part.  And, in a youthful photo of her, she looks just like my mother.  And the fact that my grandmother’s grandmother had one of her children on a reservation that was run by Ft. Sam Houston in San Antonio would point to that fact as well.  As genealogy searches go, you don’t ever stay in a straight line, doing all the research on each person completely and tying it up in a neat packages and moving on to the next.  It is like a pinball machine jumping from one person to another, sometimes knocking down brick walls and sometimes creating more As I was journeying through my grandmother’s indigenous line I found myself several generations on and discovered something that I never would have thought possible.While my 2nd great grandmother did in fact carry indigenous ancestry she also carried some interesting British ancestry as well in the form of the Symes family.  As I followed the Symes line my Ancestry page posted an interesting “possible” connection to one Grace Sherwood of Williamsburg VA fame.I had never heard of Grace Sherwood until we joined our daughter on a trip to Colonial Williamsburg a couple of years ago.  A performance depicting her arrest and trial as a witch was performed and as a result of seeing that we visited the place where her trial “by water” was carried out — we didn’t know at the time of any possible connection to this person I had never heard of.  However, when I saw the “possible connection” on my Ancestry tree I knew immediately who they were talking about.As it turns out, the connection is still speculative at this point.  It does look promising though so I will keep an eye out on the research and see what I can find as well as what is added on Ancestry.  However, it might explain why I find this mug so hilariously funny —I might have to purchase one for myself!  hahahah!"},
{"title": "Anxiety Journal", "date": "Thursday, August 31, 2023", "text": "It is a well known fact that I am a person with high functioning anxiety.  I can be down the rabbit hold in the blink of an eye.  Recently it had gotten so bad that I decided I needed to do something.  I am on a medication for blood pressure that was originally an anxiety med and it does help but some days my intrusive thoughts are just too much.So, I started an anxiety journal.And it isn’t anything like I thought it would be.I divided it up into sections — a morning routine, an evening routine, Goals for the day, food I have eaten that day (but not really a calorie counting food journal) and a spot for rating my anxiety levels throughout the day and what the trigger is.  Keeping track of the food let’s me know if anything I eat (caffeine, sugar) triggers nervousness.It was like a sigh of relief to start a morning routine and something became immediately apparent — I am the sort of person that needs structure — not a fly by the seat of my pants kinda gal.  I started with the morning routine and as I went I added more things to it and now it has become habit.  I am still sort of working on the evening routine because I don’t do well getting things done at bedtime so I think I am going to have to start my evening routine a little earlier.  That is ok too.The important thing that I have learned so far is that the busier I keep myself the less anxiety I have but I need the list, to keep me on task as my mind wanders way too much.  So, yeah, it feels really good to have a purpose everyday, even if it is just to clear a to-do list but if it helps my anxiety that is fine with me.I know it sounds ridiculous for a woman of my age to have a to-do list but the truth is that since my husband retired and we have had several health adventures, our once structured routine has flown out the window.  People say retirement is great, you can do what you want, and to some degree that is true and ok but not to the point that you lose your way.  That seems to be what has happened to me.  I am glad to be finding my way back.  Have a great Thursday!"},
{"title": "Entertainment in the Time of Extreme Heat", "date": "Sunday, August 27, 2023", "text": "Anybody who listens to just a bit of a newscast knows that the summer in Texas, this year, has been brutal.  I am not an outdoorsy person anyway but this triple digit heat has made doing anything outside impossible.  This heat has also made my arthritis much worse which is very odd I think but it seems to be a “thing”.So, we have been watching lots of television.  I have wanted to watch the Taylor Sheridan series “1883” and “1923”.  I don’t have Paramount+ streaming however and didn’t really want to subscribe so I just ordered the DVD sets for both.  “1883” was outstanding, although a bit, uh, gory, but it was well worth the time.  We are just about done with “1923” which has been just as good — Helen Mirren makes a fantastic Cara Dutton.  She is the only actress I can name that makes getting older look really good.  So, now we will start “Yellowstone” which is what started these prequels.  I have tried to watch it but never got past the first episode.  I am hoping that now with this background I will be more successful.  We need something to watch because the networks don’t have much to offer these days.When I am not watching one of these programs I am watching “Heartland” on youtube as recommended by my cousin.  It is a contemporary “western” about a family that owns a horse farm and a young teenager that “heals” broken horses.  It is really good and I am enjoying it as well — there are 16 seasons and I am in the middle of Season 2 so it should last me awhile.  I am reading a really slow book called “The Second Chance Store”.  The concept is clever but there is just something not grabbing me.  Great cover though.So, off to church.  Have a wonderful Sunday all."},
{"title": "Heat Dome — A Permanent Fixture?", "date": "Saturday, August 26, 2023", "text": "It has been very hot here in Texas for a very long time.  The new catchphrase is “heat dome”.  I don’t care what they call it, it needs to go away.  The temperatures have been so high and our power grid keeps threatening to fail and it is just time for fall.  I keep seeing photos of all the lovely fall decor and scenery and here it just looks like everything is scorched.  I can’t even talk about the wildfire threat.I have spent the last couple of days dealing with a facebook debacle.  If I didn’t use fb for some social interaction to alleviate the isolation that I live in, I wouldn’t have it.  But, long story short and all the gory details put to rest, my account was hijacked.  Now I can’t even delete it.  I am very upset over it and spent most of the day yesterday starting a new account.  I honestly have reservations about starting it again but I will see how this goes.  FB is my main means of socializing and since it looks like we are going to looking at more covid situations with possible some social distancing and who know, another lockdown I hate to not have it but it definitely isn’t worth the aggravation I went through and am still going through knowing I can’t control the account anymore. I actually feel very violated.So that is what I have been up to.  School is back in session so I am back on pick up duty which is awful in the heat but hopefully soon it will change.  I have been working on an anxiety journal to try to help my anxiety and it does help, however, after all the anxiety over the fb account I wonder if fb isn’t part of my anxiety!  Maybe too much interaction?  Who knows — I don’t think all this technology is healthy — I loved it t first but now, maybe not so much.So, anyway, just checking in, will be back soon."},

Coming to you from brutally hot Texas!  We did have a cool down over the weekend but this week is supposed to be as bad as the last few have been.  Well, why not, they are going to start tearing up the street outside our neighborhood and school is starting so it seems appropriate.Things have been busy here.  I have been working on my anxiety journal and the to do list that goes along with it.  I didn’t learn this from any place or anybody, I was just trying to figure out a way to get a grip on my crippling anxiety.  So, I am writing and I am doing and I am talking a lot to myself.  I seem better.A very wise woman — JLSHall, my cousin and the family matriarch — said to me of my anxiety “it is her observation that most anxiety is caused by other people and their expectation of you”.  And she is right — so in dealing with my anxiety I have come to realize that it isn’t what others are doing to create MY anxiety but rather MY reaction to what they are doing and what they expect.  So, I am working to adjust my reactions.  So far, I am having some success.And, in regards to the accompanying to-do list with my anxiety journal I have a discovered that I procrastinate mostly over the things that take 5 minutes or less to accomplish.  So, each day I am breaking my list up into 5 minute increments — do what I can in five or maybe 10 minutes, take a break and then continue on in like fashion.  I told myself last night —that desk didn’t get piled up in a day and it isn’t going to get clean in a day so make a start, then make another start and before you know it, it will be done.   It makes sense to me and seems to be working so I am just going to keep on keeping on.Hubs has been seeing the vestibular therapist to try to get his balance back.  It seems to be helping but some of the exercises seem to be hurting his sore hip — an old dance injury he likes to tell people — long story.  But we have been going to therapy twice a week and he seems to not be quite so apt to fall over so that is good.  He isn’t taking Dramamine with any regularity now so I think he might be on the road to recovery.  I never thought I would see him turn into a hypochondriac though yet here we are.  I just keep talking to myself!!!So, I am off to tackle my desk and my morning routine so see you soon!"},
{"title": "Nothing But Clear Skies — Hope Callaghan", "date": "Wednesday, June 28, 2023", "text": "Last night I finished the 6th book in the Easton Island series by Hope Callaghan — Nothing But Clear Skies.  It was a good read as are all of the Callaghan books I have read.  This series is a bit different than “Garden Girls” and “Made in Savannah” but Callaghan’s writing style rings true — she is a straightforward writer, uses enough words to get her point across but isn’t lofty or too wordy. I like that. I recommend.I am trucking right along on my reading challenge which is sort of a surprise to me as I fell behind pretty early in the year but I seem to be catching up.I am awaiting the arrival of a copy of a book written by an ancestor, William Banta.  It is about his 27 years on the Texas plains as a Texas Ranger.  I sounds rather dry but I am going to try to get through it.  The Banta side of my family was elusive for so many years that I really try to learn as much as I can when I get the opportunity.  There was quite a bit of marriage between the Bantas and the indigenous people of the area and I am hoping to learn more about that as well, maybe there will be some mention of it in this book but not holding out much hope.I discovered a mention of my 4th great grandmother being the daughter of an Osage woman and one of the Chouteau fur trappers.  Up until now no parent names have been given to this 4th great grandmother so I am cautiously surprised and really curious.  I might have to purchase the book about the Chouteaus.  Never mind trying to downsize the library!Well, today is a milestone birthday for Beanie.  More on that later."},

Anyway, upon further sleuthing I am cautious to report that Blockbuster has revived it’s website — yes, indeed, there it is, getting ready to be up and running.  So, yeah!It is Friday!

{"title": "Journaling", "date": "Thursday, June 22, 2023", "text": "My son, Brandon, maintains a very interesting blog titled “Brandon’s Notepad”.  He covers many subjects because he has many diverse interests.  I was reading a post about journal privacy and I brought out of the depths of my memory and incident involving me and my journal — and privacy.  It is a funny story so I don’t mind sharing.Back in my youth, diary keeping was a popular pasttime.  My aunt kept journals all her life as did my cousin.  I wanted to keep a “dear diary” as well but I just didn’t possess the self discipline.  However, for some unknown reason, I decided to make a stab at it and it was probably not a good idea.At the time I had had a row with a classmate — I won’t call her a friend because she was more of an annoyance but at any rate, we had a misunderstanding.  I decided to vent to my diary but the whole ordeal would require more paper than the little diary provided for that day.  So, I wrote my heart out on notebook paper and folded it to fit in the diary and promptly forgot about it.  I am sure I was ranting and raving which would have been ok but I chose to use a certain expletive to express my feelings.  One word.  One time.  That is all.  Some time later I was cleaning off my book case, eyed the diary and opened it.  Upon re-reading the entry on notebook paper I decided that I needed to dispose of that, it had served its purpose allowing me to vent my anger without an actual verbal altercation with the girl and no feelings were hurt. Plus, I didn’t know whether my mother prowled around in my stuff or not, I wouldn’t have put it past her, but I just felt like that wasn’t something she needed to see, because of one word.  One time.So, I tore it up into little pieces and tossed it in the toilet and sent it to its water demise.  The incident was forgotten until later that evening.  My mom was walking down the hall, found a tiny piece of paper with — wait for it — the word. Somehow I had managed to rip that paper to shreds but as luck would have it it tore precisely around the word — preserving it in its entirely.  And I accidentally dropped it.  Right next to the floor furnace — why didn’t it fall down the grate?   To say my mother flipped out would be mild, I was in tears — I was in trouble — and I had lot of  “splaining to do, Lucy”.  Well, I told the truth.  She accepted my explanation but I feel like, if she didn’t pry into my stuff before, she certainly did after that.  And that was ok because she gave me a bit of good advice that I have followed religiously since —Don’t put anything in writingAnd that is why I can’t keep a journal!  The diary pictured is not my diary although mine is blue.  I was too lazy to go find it to take a photo but I do still have it, along with a pink “Ponytail” edition.  I will keep them forever — minus any addendums."},
{"title": "In With the New and Out With the Old — or maybe no!", "date": "Wednesday, June 21, 2023", "text": "Isn’t it strange how every time a new technology comes along we embrace it (mostly) and the things that went before are so quickly forgotten?  That is how it seems.  Movies for instance — movie going was a huge part of my youth and young adulthood.  Babies came along and we still went, just less and then bingo, along came the VHS player with movie rental places all over the place. The kids loved it because they could keep up with the current trends without breaking our bank.  Friday nights were great — we would go to the video store on San Pedro (I think it was Sound Warehouse) and pick up pizza from the pizza place next door (Shakey’s?) and we had a great Friday night.  Then cable came along with all it had to offer — we didn’t have to go to the video store to watch the movies.  The VHS player sat quiet on Friday night.Then, DVD’s came along which required yet another player and back to the video store we went to rent them but it didn’t have the same flair and excitement of those Friday nights when the kids were smaller.Now we have streaming.  You can almost get everything you want to see provided you subscribe to a streaming service — or six.  We do subscribe to several and they are great - until they aren’t.There is a series on Netflix right now called “Yellowstone”.  I have wanted to watch it but just can’t get into it.  So, I decided I needed to watch the two prequel’s — “1883” and “1923”.  Easier said than done — ok, not easier but let’s just say I am stubborn.“Yellowstone” is on Netflix which I have.  The other two are on Paramount which I don’t have.  I looked at the line up on the channel and decided that I wouldn’t use it enough to warrant subscribing.  So, what is a girl to do?Obviously the logical thing would be to fork over the 4.99 for the subscription but I was having a moment and, instead, ordered the DVD.  My husband looked at me like I had lost my mind.  But, it came and we have watched 3/4 of it (outstanding, by the way, but grisly) and I have to say I am enjoying it immensely.So much so that I went to Amazon and bought two more “old” movies for my collection and yes, we have quite a DVD collection stashed away in two big drawers in the tv cabinet.  This is what I bought.“Young at Heart” with Frank Sinatra, Gig Young, Doris Day and Dorothy Malone — circa 1954.  I don’t remember seeing this movie in a theater but, in all likelihood I did.  I just know I have always loved it and have always been a huge Frank Sinatra fan — my generation was supposed to crush on the likes of Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger but not me — Frank Sinatra.  So, anyway, I did have a copy but loaned it to my daughter and, as they say, possession is 9/10 of the law! So, now I have it again.“A Summer Place” — circa 1959 — and I did see this in the theater with my mom, my aunt and my cousin.  I remember my mother asking if it was suitable for me as we were standing in line for the tickets. (Fine time to ask Bette!) and my aunt said “of course” and in we went.  They didn’t have age guidelines and the reality was it was fine, just a little bit more of an adult story line than I was used to.  It did, however, become one of my favorite teenage movies and I always liked Sandra Dee.  Of course, the theme song was lovely and we even danced to it when I took ballroom dancing a couple of years later.So, the whole point of this post is to point out that “everything old is new again?”, maybe, or maybe that not everything that comes into our lives should be so easily discarded. Of course these two movies are easily found on several streaming platforms and can be watched at will but there is something so reminiscent of those long ago Friday nights, grabbing the pizza, searching for the perpetually lost remote and settling down on the comfy plaid couch in the dark to watch the likes of “Teen Wolf’ or “Back to the Future”. Today we have a severe heat day and because the power grid here in Texas is so uh, “fragile”, we have to conserve energy so, I won’t be running large appliances including the television.  I have some Girl Scout patches to sew on and I am deep in the middle of my latest read — “Easton Island, The Christmas Gift”.  So, I am looking to a quiet day and that is ok.  Quiet days are very good things and shouldn’t be discarded."},

Well, we had three channels on the tv and a pair of rabbit ears.  If there was nothing on there was nothing on, we didn’t subscribe to more channels — there were no more channels.  So, we listened to the radio.I remember waking up in the morning with the radio on.  My dad was in the radio business — he was an announcer and a disc jockey until he went into television announcing - so we always had the radio on.  I remember when I had the measles and couldn’t watch tv I had the radio.  I listened to “Baby Snooks” reruns as well as “Amos and Andy” — I know, socially unacceptable, I apologize — but it was good.  When those weren’t on I listened to popular music — I loved “Stagger Lee”.  The radio got me through the most miserable two weeks of my life - well, until I got the mumps! Before I married, when I was still at home with my parents, we ended the night listening to Mystery Theater and this was in 1972! Loved it!I occurred to me today that I no longer listen to the radio.  Even in the car.  What in the world happened to the radio?  So…..I resurrected my Radio Shack weather radio.  That should tell you how old it is — at least 18 years old — and it doesn’t tune in much but I am having fun listening to the radio!  I am shopping for a new one even though I have a Grace digital internet radio and a Bose sound wave — we never use them.  I don’t know why, I guess it is just easier to jump on the internet and google.  I have no explanation but I am thinking that it is time to get back to basics.  Of course, when I was a big listener I was living in San Antonio and we had some great radio stations.  I haven’t found the same thing here in DFW but if I have to I will fire up the digital radio but I think the radio is going to be a regular part of my day from now on."},
{"title": "Permission to Climb Out of the Box", "date": "Wednesday, June 14, 2023", "text": "The proverbial box.  Seems we are all in one in regards to something —tied to tradition, set in our ways, whatever way you want to put it.  The box is not our friend even though it provides a certain amount of “comfort”, doing things the way they have always been done regardless of the fact that doing things we way we have always done isn’t working anymore.Warning: this might be the most self absorbed post you have ever read.  I apologize but right now I need to be self absorbed.I am a caretaker - real and imagined.  I inherited the title from my mother who was the family caretaker.  Real?  Yes, I try to be helpful for my family when I can.  I try to not overstep. My husband right now is going through a bit of a challlenge — an viral inner ear infection that has resulted in a case of vertigo.  I have tried to be helpful but now I fear I have wandered across the line of being obsessive and overwhelming and basically, not helpful.  Disclaimer, my husband has not asked me to be overwhelming — in fact, I think he is getting annoyed so I am toying with the idea of backing off.  Can I do that without feeling like I am shirking my “duty”? Hence, imaginary, does he really need me to hover?  I  think probably not but it seems to be what I do.And I am getting resentful of a situation I have brought on myself.  I am not an overly energetic person - I never have been.  My best time of the day is the morning.  Late afternoon I am pretty much done and by bed time all I want is a sleeping dog, my book and my bed.  Yes, I am a lazy moo. But here, of late, I find myself taking inventory of what I haven’t gotten done FOR MYSELF during the day.  Then I get miffed.So, I woke up this morning decided to start journaling — on paper — again.  I need to rethink the way I do things.  We have all been brought up a certain way, to do things a certain way at a certain time in a certain fashion.  But, I asked myself, is that a chiseled in marble?  Ok, take tooth flossing, for instance.  I know, gross, but stay with me here. In dental assisting school we learned that taking care of dental hygiene before bed is preferable because, while a lot of bodily healing is done at night, a lot of dental drama goes on at night as well so taking care of all that before bed is the best way to do things.  But, for people like me who don’t function well at night, is it better to do the floss dance in the morning or not do it at all?  The same goes for pleasurable activities.  I was raised to believe that the chores had to be done before fun could commence.  Since, for me, the chores never get completely done (a wise woman once said not to try to get the housework finished because it will NEVER be finished) I never get to the fun stuff.  Again, resentment.  So, would it be better to just allow myself to cross stitch a bit or read some regardless of the state of the chores?  Am I the only one bothered by the constant fluff on the floor from the dog destroyed toys? Probably.So, today I woke up thinking about the box and how to jump out of it and I think I might have a plan.I have to let go of the “musts” and the “should haves” and the “why didn’t I’s” and get real.  I thinking getting “real” means doing things when I have the energy and the five minutes to do it whether it fits into the universally accepted schedule or not.  I mean, who makes the universally accepted schedule anyway?  That’s what I’m sayin’.So, yeah, it is time to figure out a way to not be so hard on myself, to get things done (including, and maybe most importantly, the fun stuff) and to not let the resentment grow out of bounds — time to put myself up there with everybody else in terms of importance with everybody/thing else.  That is a hard thing for me to do as I have always been at the bottom of the list but my physical health and mental stability needs some boosting.  Ugh, I hate cathartic posts such as this.I finished a book that I really didn’t enjoy.  It is “Mildred Budge of Cloverdale”.  I thought it was going to be humorous but it wasn’t.  It took a religious slant which is fine for me but then it went over the line of being preachy and too many words.  I know, that sounds ridiculous to say a book has too many words but it did.  So, I don’t recommend.  Sorry author."},

However the “echoes’ part was minuscule and irrelevant.  I expected ghosts.  There were none.  They need to change the title and take out the two or so references to “echoes”.  It wouldn’t matter.I then read “Betsy-Tacy”, a children’s series that my daughter read as a child, is re-reading as an adult and my granddaughter has read.  I enjoyed it but it took me longer than I thought it would.  However, now I am into the series — the next being “Betsy, Tacy and Tib”.  I recommend this series — rather like “Little House on the Prairie” or “Pollyanna”.  Today I am getting a new exerciser to try.  It is called “The Scoop”.  It is like a pedaler but goes side to side instead.  It is supposed to do everything a conventional pedal machine does but more because the movement is lateral.  I am hoping it will help my ailing hip.  We will see.  I just know I need to do something because I have too many aches and pains.  However, I will say, with Dizzy sort of down for the count, I have been much more active (I just hauled the garbage cans in) and I am feeling a difference so there is hope.That is all my news so you have a wonderful Tuesday, dear friends.  Hopefully after Thursday and our doctor visit I will have a bit more time to myself to visit. I will let you know!"},

But, if you read it and now you can’t see it that is why — you aren’t crazy.I just finished my 10th book in my 2023 Goodreads Challenge — “Are You There God? It’s Me Margaret”.  I looked at the book years ago for Bean but it was too old for her at the time and I didn’t think about me reading it myself.  However, with the movie of the same name coming out I thought I would read the book and I am glad I did.  It was good.  It was about a 12 year old girl facing physical changes, learning about her family, questioning her religion — all things we have all done.  It is relatable and funny and I was sorry to see it end.  I am still reading “Echoes of Old Books” too but it really isn’t holding my interest so much.  I will finish it because so many times when I don’t find a book interesting it turns out to be very interesting as I get into it so we will see.Ok, that is it for now.  Thanks for stopping by."},
{"title": "Today is Not What I Was Hoping For!", "date": "Thursday, April 20, 2023", "text": "It is spring.  Spring in North Texas isn’t great but I was hoping for something better today. It is warm and windy — blowing the pollen all over me and I am having a severe allergie situation.  The forecast calls for storms this afternoon.  Trixie has demolished yet another stuffed animal all over the carpet which is going to require picking up (I have already told her the only toys she is getting are socks tied in a knot and chewy bones!) and my vacuum cleaner doesn’t do a very good job of vacuuming up stuffed animal fluff and all I want to do is go make cards.The card making bug has bitten me again and I have been watching youtube videos of a guy named Simon Hurley and his techniques.  He makes it look so effortless and you know it isn’t.  Then I watched a rather lengthy video by Jennifer McGuire using inky printed paper rather than actually inking or water coloring your own paper.  And now, I am itching from the bug bite.Unfortunately when I broke my arm I put my crafting to rest and have never picked it back up.  I was looking at my supplies a while back and most need to be replaced as they were almost spent to begin with or have just dried up from lack of use.  So, I placed an Amazon order last night for some basic stuff — I seem to have LOTS of card stock and patterned papers.  At one point I had made a whole bunch of card bases but I believe I have used them so I need to check on that and maybe start there.  The thing about cardmaking is — well, there are two — I don’t like buying ready made cards because first off you actually have to go do it and second most of them have too many words.  I am an introvert and I am not an overly mushy, gushy person so anybody actually getting a card from me in the first place (I am such a lazy moo) should realize how much they mean to me for me to actually get one mailed in the first place — I don’t have to go over the top with sentiments.  By doing my own I can control that.  Another thing about the cards is — if you are a person like me with great artistic drive/interest and zero to no talent, they are like little canvases and you can creat little bitty pieces of art without it being a huge deal.  And I feel like it IS art no matter what medium you use be it paper, paint, markers, stamps, etc.  That is my story and I am sticking to it.So, I am planning — once the allergy meds kick in — to go upstairs and start looking through/throwing out and getting ready for the amazon order to arrive.  So much anticipation for a bottle of glue.  Then I need to look at my cuttlebug.  They have been discontinued and you can’t buy parts anymore so  I need to see if mine still works at all.  And if my hand will crank it.  I might have to invest in an electric one.  That sounds exciting.  Maybe.  So, anyway, I will post some pictures of my creations if I ever get any done — I think I have a few half done so maybe I will finish those — I have to tell myself I am not in a competition and I am not in a hurry — this is supposed to be relaxing — like cross stitch.  I will be back."},

Hmmm,  I wonder) this year and since I have read very little Young Adult work I decided to give it a go.  I chose the Beachbreak High series by Emily Lowry.I really enjoyed this series — it is about a group of friends in their junior year at Beachbreak High.  They have been friends for years and have many good — and bad — memories.  It is set in California which is ALWAYS sunny and the waves are always peak.  So, these books take us through four couples — they didn’t start out as couples, just best friends, but through the course of the books they realize they really care for each other, end up coupling up, go through some negative things —not too negative and not terribly bad, and come out the other side healthy and well.These were refreshing books.  Definitely not representative of the majority of youth we see today, at least as far as I can tell, but they were good reads — good conflict, good conflict solution, great setting, happy times, sad times — Yes, I recommend for sure.  I am not sure anybody past the 7th grade would read these books because I don’t really think people in high school read at all anymore but they are missing out."},

Ha! I can’t get anything done around here, I wonder how I think I am going to do that!The foxes are gone.  I am sorry.  And then I am not sorry.  I worry Trixie is going to get sick from so much wildlife in our yard.  So, maybe it is a good thing.I am still reading, sort of, but honestly all I have been doing is watching reruns of “Frasier”.  I love “Frasier” and last night I watched the final episode which I had never seen.  It was good. I am also watching “The Farmer Wants a Wife”.  I don’t know why.  It isn’t very good and I generally don’t watch stuff like that so….blame it on allergies.So, anyway, I am still on top of the dirt but having a really hard time with allergies, lack of energy and waning interest in most everything.  I need it to be summer and winter to just go away and the allergies to just go away.  Spring is always a silly season for me — just awkward.So, have a beautiful Holy Week — or what is left of it — and an absolutely glorious Easter"},

{"title": "One Day at a Time — 2/8/2023", "date": "Thursday, February 09, 2023", "text": "Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you. —Psalm 63:3Good morning, all!  Yesterday was a less than stellar day and I have no idea why.  I seem to be wallowing in depression more these days — I think it is my age — but considering the alternative to that issue I will continue to deal with perking myself up.In the last couple of months there has been an unusually high number of passings amongst my group of friends and acquaintenances.  It is disturbing.  So, I am trying to adhere to the title of my blog — one day at a time — not looking back, not looking forward and not going any further ahead than lunch.As my joints have decided to take on a personality of their own I have decided to battle them on their level and take to walking.  The weather has been, well, not good for walking outside. I have a Tony Little Gazelle upstairs but it is, to say the least, rather boring and it really doesn’t make my knees feel good so I have decided to walk inside.  From my kitchen to my breakfast nook which is really a nice sized space, not so “nook”.  So I started — it is about 25 steps along the path I am taking so four passes give me 100 steps.  So I started.  It wasn’t long before Trixie, my shadow (should have named her shadow) was walking along side me.  Up and down the kitchen we went.  Back and forth.  She finally quit in the middle of the kitchen and waited for me to catch up with her.  Then she got under my feet and got stepped on.  I asked her to please not trip me.  So, she took a running leap and almost knocked me off my feet — she is short but solid and she packs a wallop.  She is now fast asleep on the hearth and I need to walk my other 150 steps!  My Fitbit wants me to walk 250 an hour.  I have decided to develop my own housekeeping style.  It is going to be called Bette’s Solution, named after my mother, Bette.  When my kids were little and my house would become unmanageable here would come Bette — the original Fly Lady.  She didn’t come armed with a plan or printed pages or books or anything like that.  She came with a garbage bag and commandeered my broom.  In the end of the session she would grab the vacuum just to make sure that nothing was left behind.  When my kids were big enough she would get them in the den, show them her tools and suggest that anything they wanted they best pick up — she was giving them the time spend on a cup of coffee and then she was going to work.  They didn’t believe her — the first time.  They learned!  I felt like Anne Sullivan with Helen Keller at the pump — she knows!  They knew!  If MeeMaw had a garbage bag in her hand nothing was going to stop her.And so it went.  She would sweep everything into a big pile, from the whole house, front to back, and there it was.  Easy peasy. And into the garbage bag it went.  Oh the wailing and gnashing of teeth.  The shouts of abuse.  The threats to call CPS (yes, my kids threatened to call CPS).  Do you know how many times this Bette’s Solution had to happen?  Several.  But, it got better as each time she would show up with a garbage bag those kids moved in Olympic speed.  Pretty soon their mess was contained to their rooms and nobody cared — the family room finally looked like a family of human being lived there and not a bunch of lazy sloths with too much stuff in their life.  It was a beautiful thing.Did you know that a Kenmore vacuum cleaner, from Sears, circa 1972, could pick up legos and Barbie shoes?  I wish I had visual evidence of it but you will just have to take my word for it.So, fast forward to today.We are old now and don’t have little children — even three out of the four grands have outgrown most toys — so those sorts of messes no longer happen.  Now we have old people messes and nobody to blame but ourselves.  We have gone soft, lazy, and we just don’t care.  We are trying to do all the interesting stuff while we can because we know one day it isn’t going to matter. But right now, it does matter, to me.  I dream of the days that my furniture was dusted and polished on the weekly, my sheets got changed every Monday, never fail, the dishes were washed as soon as they hit the sink — ah, yes the good old days without aches and pains and limiting things.  But something has to be done because clutter isn’t good for my mental health and my soul is letting me know it!  I will tell you though, it is tough being a neat freak with physical limitation married to a closet hoarder who thinks he has the the run of the house now.  Haha!  So phunny!So, today as I was taking my walk with the dog through the kitchen, I was thinking — what would Bette do?  And it hit me.   I know what Bette would do — she was my mother — I knew her as well as I knew myself —- she would grab a garbage bag, the broom and the vacuum cleaner.  I know I won’t get any help because Hubs doesn’t see the mess, all he sees is HIS IMPORTANT STUFF and Trixie can’t pick up her messes ( leaves dragged in and gutted stuffy toys) because she doesn’t have opposing thumbs and honestly she doesnt care so I am just going to have to take over for her and fight this battle on my own.So, wish me luck — I am going to do my second 150 steps walking around the house with a garbage bag and pick up whatever offends me.  Unlike Marie Kondo (who now admits to having a messy house) I am not going to hold it and see if it sparks joy — if it is in my way and has no sentimental value it is going in the garbage bag! I am not going to be picky.  And hopefully when my 150 steps is done my garbage bag will be filled, my soul will be a peace and I will have a feeling of accomplishment.  I will let you know."},

I started thinking about my hobbies and I have pretty much narrowed it down to three — Reading — I love to read.  I have always loved to read.  It takes me places I will never get to go and meet people that I will never meet, some that I would like to and some I would have no use for! Haha!  Now that I am using a kindle, reading is even more enjoyable because I can really take it with me wherever I go and I can change the font/lighting/etc to suit my aging eyes.  Yes, I would say that reading is my favorite hobby.Cross Stitch — I love art but can’t draw so I do what I can and, to me, cross stitch is thread painting.  I love to watch an image emerge from a blank piece of fabric and a chart with non-sensical icons.  I like to change colors around to suit me and now that I am framing my pieces in hoops and hanging them on the gallery wall on the stairs, I feel a great accomplishment there.  I really do enjoy small pieces.  I like small.  Any drawing I do is small and the needlework is small.  Coloring — Again, I love art and while I can’t really draw — I can color.  I have always loved to color — right up there with reading.  My dad was an artist and I loved to watch how he painted his comic book covers and the colors he used and he knew just where to shade — it was magic to me.Here is a very fuzzy copy of one of his covers — the original hangs in my husbands study (it used to hang in his office) because the cover depicts a mad scientist and my husband is/was a scientist so you can see where this is going.  In any event, I love to color so I have picked that back up again.This is the coloring book I am using right now —Johanna Basford does the loveliest books —And these are the tools I am using —I ordered the Bambino crayons and they haven’t arrived yet, coming from the UK but I am anxious to try them because they are clay based rather than wax based and I have heard they are really lovely to use.  Maybe as I progress I will post some of my pages.So, what are your hobbies?  I know many of you make cards and craft — I love making cards as well but right now I need to replenish my supplies as I ran out of a lot of stuff during the pandemic and just sort of stopped.  I know many people quilt — I loved it too back in the day — but I am finding that as I age I need to do short term, smaller projects that don’t put too much stress on the joints and such.  I would love to hear about what you do and see some examples — I always enjoy seeing beautiful things!I will say that during our stretch of bad weather, my mind has been on overtime which is never a good thing — it makes me cross and snappy and I tend to hyper focus on things.So, what is holding my brain hostage this time?  Well…..Genetic memory.  Celtic Christianity.  DNA and how it REALLY affects us.  And no, I don’t understand anything about DNA and I often wonder why I even took the test.  And…the God gene.  So, that is a subject for later conversation.  If you have any views on any of those things, let me know because I am really interested and mostly confused but then, that happens to me a lot!Have a wonderful Tuesday lovely ladies!"},

After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise. —Joshua 1:14-15When I was a child I grew up with the idea of  “family history”. My father was always talking about how historical his family was (and it is).  One of my cousins started her own DAR chapter and all us girls were given copies of our lineage that would enable us to become a part of the group (I did).  My mother’s family was proud of their lines as well even though they were not nearly as “historical” - well, I take that back— my Mayflower connection is from my maternal grandmother side so, yeah.My mother always enjoyed telling us about lighthearted arguments between my grandparents , him saying that his people came over on the boat and my grandmother reminded him that hers met them on the shore, alluding to her Native American heritage.I was always interested in these stories but never thought to write them down or ask many questions when I had the opportunity.  Well, I did ask more questions of my grandmother but she had her limits of what and who she would talk about.  I didn’t think to ask much of my grandfather and he offered precious little — a few stories — and made it seem like he wasn’t too inclined to talk about his childhood.I suspect in both their cases their childhoods weren’t idyllic and rather short-lived since both of them were in the work force at age 11.  But, I digress….When I started doing research in earnest I decided to focus on one group rather than jump around Willy-nilly through all my family.  Since one side of my father’s family was pretty well documented (thanks cousin Naomi), I decided to focus on the one with the closest trip back to Europe.That would be my mother’s father’s side of the family — the Davies’s if you will.  My great grandfather was James Davies (can I say needle/haystack situation?) and my great-grandmother was Dinah Sophia Webb.  It didn’t take much searching to realize that great-grandfather was going to be a bear to search for (his father’s name is John Davies —- not much better).  So, I decided to search for…Dinah Sophia Webb.  Why?  Well, Dinah isn’t an unusual name but it is more outstanding than say Margaret or Mary or Sarah AND she had a middle name — Sophia.  So, that gave me more to go on.And I found this…I have also found baptismal records for her as well…So, I have learned about her parents, most of her siblings (one brother died in a mining accident when one of those Rollie bins ran over him) and her and her siblings immigration to the US where they all settled in Pennsylvania. I have even found cousins both in Pennsylvania and the UK.But, you know what they say— when you do family history you can answer one question and raise a half dozen more and that is what I did.I knew that Dinah was born in England rather than Wales and that her family moved to Wales when she was about 9.  She was born, as per birth certificate, in Newnham, Westbury on Severn, Gloucester.  Now when they moved to Wales they moved to Blaina, Monmouthshire which isn’t very far when you look at a map.  Some censuses say she was a Welsh speaker but I don’t know for sure.  However, it occurred to me that I had done a lot of reading about where she lived as a child but I knew nothing of her place of birth.  So, I ordered this…It came today and I can’t wait to get started on it.    What can I tell you about Dinah?  She was very tiny — she could stand under my grandfather’s outstretched arm and he was 5’4”.  She was intolerant of people that didn’t live like she thought they should and was known to not allow certain people to walk in front of her house and would run them off with a broom.  My grandmother and grandfather married during WW1 and after it was over they moved back to Pennsylvania and lived with Dinah.  I don’t think she cared much for my 16 year old Southern grandmother because she literally terrorized her talking about putting “slow poison” in somebody’s tea!  Yikes! It is no wonder that my grandmother got on a train back to Texas rather quickly!  But, rumor has it that Dinah was an expert at making Welshcakes.  A few years back I got the recipe from a cousin and now I make Welshcakes.  And she went to church and she had a cottage garden and she had 12 children and lost several — two are buried somewhere in Wales.  I wish I had known her.  I think.  I am sure she mellowed out with age.  Surely.Dinah Sophia Webb Davies"},

Hahaha!  I have been doing it since I was 22.  I have had four doctors diagnose it.  It is just a fact of my life.Since I feel like rubbish, like a lot of jet lag, I am not sure what I am going to get accomplished today.  I know I have to vacuum the living room carpet and wash at least one load of laundry.  No guarantees when that will happen.I spent some time yesterday evening perusing the offerings on Kindle Unlimited looking for some good reads for this year — I already have a rather long “want to read” list.  But there are so many things that look good — it is going to be a good reading year.I am still reading my current little Irish Christmas read.  It is going good but it is a bit draggy in places — I think they could step it up a bit but it is still engaging enough so we will see how it goes.The weather today is going to be gorgeous — mid 80’s this afternoon — my kind of winter being the South Texas gal I am.  However, tomorrow it is going to be chilly again and that is ok, my cold weather friends need some love too.Speaking of weather, isn’t that flooding in California awful?  I have to say though that I wonder if we would be getting so much coverage if it wasn’t an area of high celebrity.  I know, that was snarky.  I am sorry, I am sleep deprived.So, with that said, I think it is time to go have a nice cuppa — I hope I don’t fall asleep with the cup in my hand —"},

Blessed are all who take refuge in him.—Psalm 2:11-12It is Monday again — I think I might finally have my days back in order.  This holiday season has left me a bit confused on what day it is — it usually doesn’t do that when Christmas is on a Sunday (which I really enjoy BTW) but this year has been different.  However, I think I am back on the right track.I have been doing some decluttering as of late.  My last trip to the charity bin yielded three garbage bags full of previously loved clothing for somebody else to love.  I hope whoever buys these things from the charity shop enjoys them and are blessed by them.Today I have to work on the Girl Scout patch blanket.  Bean earns so many patches that they won’t fit on her vest so they have moved on to applying them to a blanket.  It is my job to sew them on.  It is a hot mess.  Some are done on machine, some by hand, they all look like they were attached by some sort of wild chicken.  I try to get them straight and even but clearly I don’t see straight and even and there is always one or two that are wonky.  But I had quite the batch to put on and have done about half.  Today I will try to whittle that down a bit more.Speaking of Girl Scouts — Cookie season is upon us so if you see some little adorable girl child at your door or at a booth at your grocery store or mall I implore you to buy a box or a dozen, it doesn’t matter, it all helps.  You might ask where the money goes and I will tell you even though I don’t know the exact percentages — part goes to the council to pay for administrative things and  fun, educational activities.  The rest goes to the individual troops and this is their operating money for the year — any field trips, parties, trips, patches, etc, comes from this money.  When the girls do service projects that require supplies, it comes from this money.  So, the money is used by and for the girls and isn’t funneled into other places.  With that said, the individual troops can choose to donate some of their proceeds to charities or causes of their choice but that is a decision made by the troop, the leaders and the parents.  For instance, our girls have always had an interest in supporting the Humane Society — all of them pet lovers — so if they chose to donate a portion of their cookie proceeds to that organization they could with the proper permissions.  Our girls tend to like to buy the supplies and make dog toys or collect towels and blankets for our furry friends but you get the point.  So, be aware the girls are going to be out and about and amongst you.  Some of them can be persistent, even though we instruct them in being polite and good salesgirls, but just keep in mind that it is a good thing to buy cookies, they taste pretty good, they freeze very well and you are helping to form a little girl into, hopefully, a responsible adult.My daughter has had troop 3390 since they were like 5 years old, we have a few of the original members but some have gone and been replaced with others. We have three levels in our one troop, the youngest being in the 5-6 age range and the oldest being about 12 1/2 years old.   The older girls help the younger girls and act as role models, they do things separately and together but they work very hard to attain their goals.  One of their goals was to go on an actual trip.  A real trip.  So many of the troops plan and save for a long time to be able to go on a trip. Well, last year was our girls year — they went to Savannah, Georgia — the home of the American Girl Scouts.  They visited Juliet Gordon Lowe’s home (a gorgeous mansion I might add),  they saw the sights of Savannah and learned a lot of southern history, they went on a ghost tour and had a lovely dinner at the Pirate House, the oldest building in the area and I am sure that memories were made that would last a lifetime.   And the memories of standing outside at Anthropologie in freezing cold weather to sell those cookies to finance the trip were just a fading hardship.  Also, something that I don’t think is common knowledge is that donations are accepted.  Many times we have people stop by who don’t want to buy the cookies but would like to donate cash — we accept cash and it goes to our veterans.  How you might ask?  Whatever money goes into the donation jar is then used to pay for leftover cookies which are then distributed to appropriate facilities.  Oneyear we took the cookies to the Joint Reserve Base DFW — formerly Carswell AFB.  The personnel were standing waiting to accept our offerings and our girls were able to shake hands, thank them for their service and even get a hug or two.  It was a win-win situation for all involved and those soldiers really like the lemon cookies!Another service project that our girls do every year is participate in Wreaths Across America where wreaths are placed on veteran graves all around the country.   One year we took them to the Dallas/Fort Worth National Cemetery which is beautiful and huge.  The last two years they have gone to a historical cemetery close to downtown Fort Worth.  They love doing this — maybe the weather, maybe lunch afterward or maybe just showing respect for people who have done service for you.  Lunch is paid for by the troop — again, cookie money.Oakwood Cemetery, 2022.So, that will be all I say about cookies and Girl Scouts.  It is a truly admirable organization, it does good work and it helps these girls see a wider world than the one in which they live.  Thank you for your help if you so choose.  I will be standing, in the cold, at the shopping center for the next six weeks or so — I think I will take a chair."},

And I don’t need “worse”.  So I am going to look at turmeric.  And walk.I received my new Fitbit yesterday so I will be counting steps.  Maybe that will help.That is the wrist I broke so it doesn’t really look normal anymore but anyway, that is the new Fitbit.  So, that is what today holds.  I need to finish some laundry I started, put on a pot of soup and wrap the hoop!Have a wonderful Saturday, all!"},

For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.2Corinthians 4:18I like todays verse because it reminds me that there is more to “life” than just what we see.  If we only look at this life we have a very narrow field of vision for sure.  While I love my life and the people in it I would be very sad to believe that this is all there is.As I mentioned a couple of days ago, I have been playing in my sketchbook.  I love art — color, shapes, texture — I love nature although I like to observe it from afar — I will never be an outdoor enthusiast that does things like camp and hike. And, I love trees.  So, I sat down yesterday and decided to make another go of a tree.  Here is my attempt —Yes, I realize it is crooked because I was sitting at an angle, I suppose.  I looks more like a Halloween tree than the one in my back yard but it is a decent attempt.  I have a feeling that this whole sketchbook is going to be filled with trees.  A strange thing happened while I was drawing it though — as I was working on the right side of the trunk a voice popped into my head — a male voice — and simply said “your lines are too straight”.  And he popped right out again.  It was clear as a bell and I know who the voice was.   That isn’t possible, is it?  Well, I took “his” advice, made my lines less straight and it all came together to be this.  Yes, it is crooked but I figure it has just spend eons with the wind blowing it that way.  I wonder what lives in the hole in the middle?  I think a nice little squirrel family.  I will continue to work on this tree and maybe there will be a story. Story writing is something I always enjoyed doing as well — it is also a form of art — painting pictures with words.  We did a lot of creative writing in high school and I was always very secretly proud of myself for having my work routinely used by the teacher in other venues like teacher conferences and things like that.  I still like to write stories but haven’t done so in awhile.  Back about 42 years ago I signed up for one of those correspondence writing courses that you see in magazines — The Institute of Children’s Literature.  It was legit and I really enjoyed doing the assignments.  One thing I wrote was called “The Perils of Petie” about a parrot — an arrogant little thing — that learned some good life lessons.  My father mocked it up and was going to illustrate it for me but that never came to fruition.  I still have the mockup.  He always encouraged me.Today I have some more cross stitch supplies coming.  Needlework or needlecrafts is another form of art for me, even if I am just following a pattern.  I received my new hoop and I have ordered some twill tape to wrap the bottom hoop with and a couple of other little notions — a seam ripper and a tape measure.  It will be here today and I can’t wait to get that hoop wrapped.  I also ordered a new tote from Lands End. This will be my new cross stitch tote.  I bought the medium and figure it will probably be a little too large — we will see.  It was on a really good sale or I would not have purchased it — I only buy on sale. Right now I am using a knitting caddy to, well, tote everything around in, and, after many years the thing is pretty much collapsing on me and falling apart.  I need something new and less obtrusive.So, hopefully the tote bag will get here soon and it will be an improvement.  Not much has been happening on Noah’s Deck — there are still two foxes out there from time to time and a half dozen cats that wander through — not to mention the bobcat — but the one thing missing is Bam, my little favorite fox.  I don’t see any evidence that anything bad has happened to her so I am just hoping that, since it is mating season, she has found the love of her life and is out being her best self.  I am sad though because watching her was a highlight of my day.  I am hopeful though that she will be back.So, I am off to do some chores.  I started walking yesterday and did increase my step count by quite a bit but not nearly what it should be.  However, in this case, I believe in “baby steps”.  We will see how it goes.Have a wonderful day and do something exciting!"},

This has become much easier as the days have passed.  The first day I really had to think it through and, honestly, make myself go through the motions.  Now, just after day 5, it is becoming second nature and I am actually looking forward to it. I have been working on my planners today.  Yes, multiple planners.  Why you ask?  Because I can’t make up my mind.  I have a small one that I carry in my purse solely for appointments and school schedules.  I have a large one that I use for the same appointments/school schedules but I also add food intake, steps walked and books read.  Then I use Google calendar on my phone and iPad because sometimes the little pocket calendar doesn’t make it into my purse.  Oh, and then there is the wall calendar.  I use that so that everybody can see what is going on with us.  Clearly I have a problem and need to decide on one or the other or something.I am making an effort to up my steps.  I have a garmin tracker but honestly, it has never worked.  It is my second one, the first one worked but this one won’t sync and the screen is so low light I can’t really read it.  So, last night I purchased a new Fitbit.  It will be here tomorrow.  I am trying to up my steps to help my knee.  We have a large yard with a sidewalk on one side.  I will use the sidewalk daily but today I took Trixie on a hike.  She was thrilled! She got tangled up around a tree and I was wishing I had taken my cane but we did ok.  Maybe I should do it more often.  Maybe I will.  Hmmmm.I am back into genealogy and I am giving a lot of thought as to how I want to proceed.  I am feeling the need to write it all down, on paper, again and have that option as well as the digital tree on Ancestry.  I really find comfort in paper — it seems like it is less likely to just disappear on me.  Anyway, I digress — I found this book and purchased it My great-grandmother Dinah was born in Westbury-on-Severn in Gloucestershire.  She lived there with her family until approximately age 9 when the Webb family relocated to Blaina in Monmouthshire.  I am not sure how major a move it was because on the map the two places seem pretty close but in 1870 it was probably major.  She was a very religious person and didn’t believe in taking photographs so there are only a couple of pictures of her and I am lucky to have copies of them.When I received this photo from a cousin I was surprised to see how much she looked like my grandfather.  I don’t know why that surprised me but I didn’t have a mental idea of what she might look like.  She was very short — my grandfather was 5’4” and she could stand under his arm.  She had twelve children.  Was was not a pleasant person according to my grandmother who lived with her for awhile and she was known to chase people off the walk in front of her house with a broom if she didn’t approve of the person.  She was a domestic all her life, working up until she died.  She went to a Welsh baptist church both here and in Wales — both churches named Bethel Baptist — I wonder if they somehow sponsored them but I don’t know.  Anyway, I am looking forward to getting the book to see a bit of the place she came from.  I wish I could have met her — I doubt I would have liked her! Haha! But she passed 13 years before I was born.  Bad timing.So, I guess I should go empty the dishwasher, do the leaf control since we went on a hike and brought some in with us and put in my daily load of laundry.  We are having a very mild winter, so far, and I need to take advantage of it and enjoy the outdoors a bit today."},
{"title": "One Day at a Time — Day 4 — Too Much Excitement", "date": "Wednesday, January 04, 2023", "text": "Joshua told the people, \"Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do amazing things among you.\"  Joshua 3:5I have been interested in prepping for a long time, I like the idea of being prepared for things — if the weather is bad, if a pipe bursts, if the grocery store doesn’t have something … I think preparation is a good thing — forever a Girl Scout I am.   However, in the long run, the first thing we need to prep is our relationship with God and that is what today’s verse is alluding to.  Yesterday proved to be more exciting than I was prepared for.  We went for lunch as usual to a restaurant across the highway.  As we were coming home we exited the highway and turned into our regular shopping center — cutting through to get home if you will.  We traveled our usual route through the parking lot when we  came upon a large number of  emergency vehicles — a fire truck, several police cars and an ambulance was headed that way.  There were two cars in various states of disrepair on the road.  There was a person on the ground with people around him and people lining the sidewalks watching.We were able to pass and went on our way figuring there had been a car accident.  The stop signs in this shopping center aren’t easy to see so it is safe to assume that an accident wasn’t out of the question.Well, that wasn’t a safe assumption.  Seems Car A hit Car B in the Olive Garden parking lot and didn’t stop.  A chase ensued and ended in gunfire.  One person ended up in the hospital, the other in jail.  Sadly the first person passed due to his injuries.This was before noon.What is wrong with people.  That was enough excitement to last me for — well — ever.  As one person commenting on the situation on FB said “this is why I sit in my backyard and order online”.  I have pulled my sketchbook out and am playing with pencil and paper.  In my dotage I wish I had been as interested in art when I was young and trainable as I am now but, alas, I wasn’t.  I can’t draw — I didn’t get the gene.  But I like to try and I like to doodle and I fancy myself one day being able to draw a tree.  Yes, I  know what you are thinking…..a tree?Yes, I love trees — the craggy old trees you find in pictures of storybook woods.  The kind that always have tufts of grass at the exposed roots with maybe a stray daffodil coming up and the ears of a bunny hiding behind the big chunky root.  I am not too bad with the trunks but it is the upper branches that have me confuzzled as Bean would say.  I will continue because at some point I am going to be able to draw a tree.  I wish my father was here, he could help me but I wasn’t interested when I had him around and now…well, anyway.Speaking of Bean, I think I mentioned that she had her first date —a trip to the mall with the BoyFriend.  Her mother was a few paces back as they “shopped”.  Apparently it was a rousing success and they are still speaking — all of them, girl and BF and girl and mother.  I would say that was a win-win.So, now Missy Bean has decided she needed to start wearing makeup.  A month ago she wasn’t having it but how quickly young minds change.  As anybody who has read this blog knows, she is fair, Celtic complected with gorgeous red hair.  None of which works well with black mascara.  So, her mother and her mother’s friend took her and her little friend P on a “fun day” and they arranged for a makeup consultant at Sephora to help them.  Bean came home with $100 worth of the most gorgeous, absolutely invisible makeup available.  Her consultant found some mascara that would work with pale, nondescernable eyelashes in a shade of warm brown, a beautiful “twinkle blush” by Benefit (Dandelion Twinkle), an eye shadow palate of light corals, pinks and taupes (Tarte)  and some lovely coral lip gloss, Sephora brand (had to sell some Sephora product).  When she emerged from school yesterday, even after a full day at school, she was absolutely glowing.  I didn’t even realize she had the makeup on because it is such subdued colors but she just glowed.  So that just goes to show you, redheads CAN wear mascara!  I remember when I first saw her a bit after she was born, that transparent skin and red/blond hair, and my first words to her parents were “she is absolutely gorgeous but she will never wear black mascara”.  Nona knows.So, I woke up this morning with the leader or muscle or something essential in the back of my knee totally cramping up.  I have been hobbling around unable to stretch my leg out at all so I guess, after I have my cup of tea, I should get up and walk around.  I should probably take something too.  I need to start taking the glucosamine I bought but honestly, I am afraid of it so I am going to wait until I get it approved by the doctor.  I have given up coffee again.  I have been having non-stop panic attacks for the last week and I blame it on my coffee consumption.  My husband is a coffee addict and he encourages me and I have gone many years without caffeine and now I have started drinking it and I don’t think it is doing me any favors.  So, I am back to tea and will start drinking some green tea again and hopefully that will help my knees. I need to get some cherry juice as well.  Oh, I got my new embroidery hoop so I am going to spend part of the day reducing my cross stitch stash and taking it to the charity shop bin this afternoon.  Here it is — It is hefty and smooth and feels so good inhand.  I started working on a piece that I put down to do the Stranger Things piece and I have been working inhand but I don’t think it is going as well because the count is finer and I need it in a hoop.  So, I am anxious to try this one.  I am waiting though for some twill tape to come, from the same company, made in France, to bind the inner hoop with to help with slipping. I am so excited and I am excited to refine my supplies — you know you can have too much of a good thing!So, I am off to try to do something for my knee, have another cuppa and get some laundry hung.  Half the oak tree has blown in the back door so I have to do leaf control too and that will destroy my back.  But, once I get it done I can enjoy another video by The Unexpected Gypsy.Have a lovely day!"},

Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go.  Joshua 1:9I find today’s verse to be very comforting.  Sometimes we feel alone even when we are in a crowd but we don’t need to.  We must always remember that we are never truly alone.So, today started out a little iffy with my new morning routine but I persevered and came out on the other side with clothes on and a made bed.  So…win!I am also looking at my abysmal housekeeping skills and look back at my childhood and how I was raised.  My mother was a great housekeeper but her house was only 950 square feet with one bathroom!  She was the sort that would clean house, down to the bleach, on a daily basis and if she got angry about something she could do it in record time!  That isn’t my method for dealing with anger — I eat my way through it —but her way was clearly better.So, I have run through all the possible techniques to keep the house tidy and clean from “clean it when you see it”, Flylady, a daily/weekly regime — none of it really works for me.  So, I am thinking of assigning daily chores — like vacuuming the carpet daily, morning routine daily, doing a load of laundry a day to hopefully eventually catch up and then assigning one room a month or a week or something to clean thoroughly.  We have two bedrooms that aren’t used unless somebody is sleeping over which happens — rarely if ever anymore.  So I don’t need to clean them on the daily/weekly/.  I will work it out — I think the thing to focus on is clutter and that is a big focus.  So, anyway, I digress.  The morning routine went well and that makes me happy.Do you use a planner?I used to use one a lot, then I didn’t, now I struggle.  I have a small one for my purse and I try to use Google calendar on my phone but I fail miserably at that one and that is probably the one I should be using.  But while at Michaels the other day I noticed that they were having a sale on their Happy Planners and I couldn’t resist. My new Happy Planner!  Isn’t it lively and lovely and so spring like!  I haven’t written one word in itThis is the little one I carry in my purse.  It fits right in and the spaces are large enough to keep track of appointments and such.So, today I am going to work in my planner.  I think it might be helpful to keep my mind straight with the housecleaning.  Maybe not.We are having Christmas with my son and his family this evening.  My daughter in laws family will be there as well as while we don’t exchange serious gifts we do tend to gift consumables.  So, this year I decided to make Christmas Crack.  My sister in law makes it and my mother in law loved it.  She used to share it with us — a little bit — so I thought I would give it a go.  It is an easy recipe, doesn’t take long but I have never made candy before so I was a bit nervousThis was the finished product going into the refrigeratorThe next step was to chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours and then break into pieces and store in an airtight container.  Well, that got into my bedtime so it is still chilling and hasn’t been broken into pieces.  I will be doing that in a little bit— I hope I CAN break it up.  However, if I can’t break it up that probably means it is inedible so all my effort will have been wasted.  I will report back when I am done.Today in weather we are expecting some rain and storms, but more east of us which hopefully means we won’t getting too much of the boomy booms and the spinny spins — thunder and tornadoes — both of which I am decidedly not fond of.  I guess some rain would be ok but we do have plans for this evening so I don’t need much of that either.  We had a cold snap a couple of weeks ago but since then our winter has been reminiscent of those in San Antonio — warm and humid — and I have liked it a lot.  It won’t stay this way but I am enjoying it while it is.So, off to drink my And then head into the laundry room with a load.  By then Bean should be here and no telling what mischief we will get into — breaking up that Christmas Crack!"},
{"title": "One Day at a Time — Day 1 Happy New Year!", "date": "Sunday, January 01, 2023", "text": "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!   2 Corinthians 5:17What a fitting Bible verse for this day! Putting the past behind and moving forward with intention.  I like it!So, it is also fitting to draw up the loose ends of last year and begin anew and I will start with my finishes for the year —READING — I ended my 2022 Goodreads reading challenge by finishing 36 books.  My goal was 25 but sometime during the summer I had an attack of the energizer bunny syndrome and I just couldn’t read enough.  So, I outdid myself — a first for me.  In response to that I have signed up for the 2023 Goodreads reading challenge and pledging to read 45 books.I ended the year with #17 of the Garden Girls Cozy Mystery series and I think there are #23 in the entire thing.  I will finish that series this year.  Hopefully more will be added as well as more added to the Made in Savannah series which I will carry on with if there are.I have already started this years challenge with a YA title called “It Had to be Mason”.  It is a romance which is better than the depressing dystopian themes that usually go along with this genre.  So, we will see how it goes — I am already three chapters in so it is going quickly.  I remember when I was a child that the one thing I wanted to do was learn to read so when I did a whole new world was opened to me.  I remember getting my first library card and it was as exciting as getting a new toy.  Reading has always soothed my soul and maybe that is why I have been doing so much of it of late — my soul has been restless and troubled and it is in need of calming down.  So….my kindle will probably get good use in 2023.NEEDLEWORK —  2022 found me getting involved with counted cross stitch again.  It isn’t as easy for me now as it was when I was younger but I won’t be giving into to my nemesis Arthur-itis who has chosen to take up residence with me.  No, I plan to continue into 2023 by completing a piece I bought in Colonial Williamsburg and starting a kit my daughter bought me of  The House of the Seven Gables.  This year I decided to try some new techniques — gridding for one and putting into practice loop starts and pin stitch stops.  Gridding is a keeper as is the loop start.  However the pin stitch ends I will have to work on.I also gave up using a hoop or q-snap and decided to stitch an entire piece in hand.  When it was done I decided it was the worst looking piece I had ever done and I have done many.  However, after a wash, iron and finish I don’t think it is too bad! I did purchase myself a new, wooden hoop though — planning to downsize supplies and going for quality over quantity.  Here is the finish —I enjoyed doing this piece — a little different than my normal stuff and I hope the Bean likes it!  MORNING ROUTINE —  I need to improve on my morning routine.  I have come to realize that if you have a routine, you just start your day off in a more positive way.  Plus, getting some of the least interesting stuff out of the way early can’t be a bad thing.   I have gotten in the habit of getting up, putting on the slippers, grabbing the dog and not giving any thought to— well, anything.  So, my goal is to harken back to my Flylady days and get dressed to the shoes, skincare, combed hair and made bed.  Then I can tackle the day.EVENING ROUTINE — I go to bed at 9 o’clock.  My choice?  No, it is the dogs bedtime.  And she won’t go alone.  And if I don’t take her she sits and barks at me so it isn’t worth fighting it.  Besides, since I am not sleepy at 9 pm it give me at least a good hour or hour and a half to read which I do every night.  However, I do need to add a few things to my  evening routine.  I need to make sure the room is tidy, I need to indulge in skincare because that is my happy place now, not makeup.  I need to make sure my bed is optimal and that my shoes are put away.  I have always had an aversion to messy sheets and open closet doors — I can’t sleep well with either situation so I need to realize I am not a teenager who can sleep any place under any circumstances and make sure that my space is right.  And water.  I need to remember to drink water before I go to bed.  Yes, I will be up in an hour but I do get so dehydrated with the heat on.And last but not at all least — SELF CARE — what I mean by self care is not just skin care or watching what I eat or trying to walk more — to me it is being self aware and knowing when I ‘need’ something, some sort of respite or some sort of attitude adjustment and taking the proper action to avert a really negative situation.  Two weeks ago we had some sadness befall the family, a passing, and it has sent me into a depressive spiral that I need to shake.  I am a faithful person, I know this individual is not here but not gone, I know he is in the presence of God and even though the circumstances surrounding his passing shocked us, it was well and truly orchestrated by God and is His will being played out.  So, I know that I should be celebrating this life well lived and not allowing myself to go down the rabbit hole of depression.  So, yesterday, as I sat and allowed myself to wallow in it a bit — just a bit — I realized that my 2023 mantra was going to serve me well — one day at a time — we can’t get yesterday back to change anything and we don’t know what tomorrow holds so live for today, give thanks and praise, take care of each other and be kind."},

{"title": "Lessons to be Learned from Amazon", "date": "Monday, December 26, 2022", "text": "Because of the pandemic I have been shopping differently — and enjoying it more — because I don’t like to shop in the first place.  I have finally honed in on a brand of clothing that suits my aesthetic and budget so I have been buying clothing items from that site.  Shoes are a different story.  I have tweaked my skin care routine and makeup choices so those items can be purchased most anywhere, most often from Target or Ulta or Sephora, all of which are close by and who also have very good websites.I have been working hard to find products that I like, that are quality-enough without being cost prohibitive and that are easy enough to acquire.  I have learned to love Amazon — until now.Most of our Christmas gifts are monetary but I do like to purchase a few things now and then.  One thing I was looking for is called a Book Nook — it is a kit to build that is a little diorama to fit on a bookshelf.It looks like fun and it is cute so I bought one off Amazon. It took forever to arrive. Months.  It finally arrived in a box that was a little worse for the wear but it seemed to be ok.  Fast forward to now and I learned that the light feature was the wrong thing.  I tried to find the people I got it from and it was just a futile chase so I went to the manufacturer website.  There was a three paragraph disclaimer about how there are fakes on Amazon and elsewhere and how to identify a fake.  My purchases ticked all the boxes.  So, I was annoyed and reordered the thing from the real website.  It should be here in a few days.  Hopefully it will be ok.  It is supposed to come with a certificate of authenticity.We will see."},

And I am missing my bloggy friends! So, I am hoping to be more consistent in my posting in the coming year.This years Goodreads challenge went well — my goal was 25 books and I managed to complete 35 so for 2023 my goal is going to be 35 and we will see how it goes.  My most recent finish was “The Irish Nanny” and it was very good and I recommend.  I have been lucky this year in choosing titles — I only gave up on one — so that was what I call a success.  I started a new book yesterday, another of the Garden Girls cozy mystery series, but since I won’t be finished reading before the new year it will go on next years list.  I highly recommend that series, along with other of Hope Callaghan’s books — good, clean, fun reads.My journey back into cross stitch has been relatively successful.  My current project is a piece representing the five kids in the series “Stranger Things”.  Bean watched the series and then introduced me to it.  I did it because she was so excited about it but in the end I really enjoyed it.  However, I haven’t gotten the piece completed— only a couple of hundred stitches away but I won’t be done to give it for Christmas so it might have to be a New Years gift — spread out the joy a bit.  My kids brought me a kit from their Thanksgiving trip to NYC — it is The House of the Seven Gables and that will probably be my next go along with completing my pieces from Williamsburg.  Those three should take me the whole year!The weather here has taken an unfortunate turn.  It has been very cold and we even had some snow.  I am a South Texas gal and this isn’t my cuppa tea but hopefully it will be over early in the week.  So, I will be closing the year out here now.  I wish each and every one of you and your loved ones a wonderful holiday season and a prosperous and healthy new year.  See you on the flip side."},

I am trying to adapt to these new normal situations we find ourselves in and I am fairly flexible especially when it allows me to have somebody else grocery shop for me — not my favorite activity.  So, groceries should arrive at my door between now and 3:02 pm.  I have high hopes — maybe foolishly.I have also been doing a lot of reading and tv bingeing while I am “resting” and “taking it easy” aka losing my mind and I have stumbled across a Netflix series with Jack Whitehall called Travels with My Father.  He and his father, Michael, are having traveling adventures and it is hilarious.  Check it out if you find yourself resting and taking it easy for any reason at all.Ok, so the weather here has turned nasty — cold and wet — so I am off to entertain myself somehow.  I think today I might be able to focus enough to do some cross stitch.  Has anybody got any idea how absolutely bloody boring “resting” and “taking it easy” is?  Sorry, just a bit grumpy."},

Earlier in the week Hubs felt really sick for a couple of days and then he rallied.  I felt bad starting on Wednesday and by Friday night I was feeling more like a “bug” and less like allergies.  Saturday I told my daughter that if I didn’t feel better by Sunday I would test and her reply was “or you could do it now”.  Ah, the logic of youth.So, I did.And yes, I am.And I insisted that Hubs test too.And yes he is. So, yeah.The irony?  Oh, I have battled with weight issues my entire adult life.  Nothing seems to work very well or for very long.  So along comes covid, away goes the appetite, the only thing that tastes good is Halloween candy so I have been enjoying that figuring that it doesn’t much matter and what happens?  I lose 3 pounds. I don’t understand life."},

{"title": "Feeling Fallish, Allergies and Learning to Walk All Over Again", "date": "Friday, October 21, 2022", "text": "It is feeling fallish here in NTexas even though we are supposed to have a warming trend over the weekend.  It won’t last though as our weather has truly changed.  I am enjoying it because autumn is my favorite season and it doesn’t last long enough here.I am getting used to wearing the new orthopedic shoes along with new orthotic inserts.  I will say I think it is helping — my feel feel better and I managed to make a Target run yesterday without my hip cramping up.  I think my knees might feel better but the jury is still out on that.  Having to wear these shoes is forcing me to change some things around here — I am no longer able to just walk around in loungewear, barefooted and all undone.  I am having to get up and pull myself together because if I think these shoes look icky with jeans I am sure I won’t like them with a nightie or pajamas.  So, I am starting my day ready for my day — Flylady throw back!  I did notice when I took my shoes off last night that my toes were less swollen so that is a good thing.Trixie doesn’t quite understand my fascination with the foxes and I think she feels a bit left out of things.  She was a bit miffed that I hadn’t published a photo of her new hair “do”.  So, here she is in all her glory —it is a #2 clip all over and I think she looks just ravishing.And, speaking of the foxes — yesterday my daughter picked up the Bean after school, walked out the front door to her car and immediately phoned me and said “Mom, there is a fox laying on the driveway”.  I thought maybe it was in front or back of her car, blocking her exit but no, it was inside the gate so she took a photo of a sleeping Bam.  Now we have talked about these foxes for months and months now but she seemed genuinely awestruck by the fact that it was curled up like a dog and then, when it noticed her, it stretched out like a dog and continued it’s sunbath.  She thought it was going to run off because she disturbed it but the fox stuck around for a photo session with my husband.  I told him what was going on so he went out to the garage, stood behind the car and shot about 24 pics of Bam actually posing for him — so here you go for your viewing pleasure —So there you go — our Bam enjoying the lovely fall weather — her tail is getting really fluffy so I think she is putting on her winter coat.  She never goes too far away,  I don’t think, which is good but I am afraid she is becoming domesticated and that isn’t good for a wild animal.  Today I am going to test out my new shoes and how long I can stay on my feet to get a few things done around here.  I really need to do some closet cleaning and I guess I need to pass on several pairs of shoes that I won’t be wearing anymore.  So, I am going to give that a go.  A little laundry perhaps.  There are charity shop bins at all the schools for clothes an household items donation — one right as we pull into the parking lot at Bean’s school — so that is an easy thing.  Hopefully I can fill at least one bag today — that is a start.  So, it is Friday! Have a wonderful weekend!"},

{"title": "Old Dog New Tricks the Sequel", "date": "Wednesday, September 28, 2022", "text": "As you know I have taken up cross stitch again.  I have done some form of embroidery since I was about 5 years old, off and on.  I like cross stitch because it is like art to me — thread painting — and can be as extravagant as you want it to be — or as simple.  I have an artistic soul, I think inherited from my father, but absolutely no artistic talent which I got from my mother.  So, cross stitch seems to be a happy medium for me.I have spent some time and money investing in some new tools and gadgets in the last few months, all of which I have blissfully discarded.  The phrase “more trouble that it is worth” comes to mind.  When I broke my arm I managed to render myself a bit lame in my left hand so I am having trouble holding on to a q-snap so I gave it up and went back to a hoop. Being a stitcher of a certain age I also require some magnification and more light.  So I dug out my magnifier lamp and started using it — using is a relative tame term, more like wrestling with it.Now I am sitting in a recliner with a regular end table next to me — limited room to spread out so by the time I get the q-snap or hoop under the light and all the thread to the left of me I feel like I am being eaten by “stuff”.So, I switched things up.  Gone is the big light replaced by this one that goes around my neck.I am not using a magnifier at all.I have dumped the q-snap and the hoop and am stitching in hand.I am using these little silicone things to roll the excess fabric up.  I gridded the entire pattern and rather than wrangle a large paper pattern I have put the pattern into GoodNotes so I can mark it up and make it as large as I need to see the symbolsI can’t show you the whole pattern because of copyright issues but I think this will be ok.I have also decided to do this pattern one color at a time since I have the whole thing gridded and I don’t have a hoop to move around.  I have never done a project one color at a time and I am sort of enjoying this , only dealing with one skein or bobbin of thread at a time — lots less clutter.Anyway, now all I have is the light around my neck, my fabric and my iPad.  It is much, much easier and much, much more relaxing to stitch in hand with limited “stuff”.This is a project for the Bean.  If you remember I did a couple of cartoon characters for her over the summer.  Well, this is a Stranger Things pattern and I will share when I am done."},
{"title": "The Midnight Children", "date": "Thursday, September 22, 2022", "text": "Ok, so, you never know when you are going to learn of a new and exciting read.  Last week we were at the dentist and while I was waiting for the Hubs to get done with his appointment I had a lovely conversation with the office manager, Donna, who I count as a friend not just someone who takes my payment.We were talking about “Stranger Things” and how we both, surprisingly, enjoyed it.  Then she told me about her latest read — “The Midnight Children” by Dan Gemeinhart.  It is the story of Ravani, a very lonely only child and his parents and then the seven orphans who take up camp in the vacant house across the street.  There is much excitement, adventure, mystery and learning that takes place in this book.  Now, I have to say that the descriptions of the slaughterhouse, the main industry of the small town it is set in, is maybe a bit over the top and I could have done with less of that but the overall premise of the story was good and the characters of Ravani and Virginia were very well fleshed out.I enjoyed this book as an adult, I think kids would like it and I am going to buy a copy for my own library — I don’t do that much anymore so for me to do that it has to be good.  I will let you know what the kid thinks about it."},

It is a quick read that I think you will enjoy."},

{"title": "Life as We Know It is Changing — How is that working for ya?", "date": "Thursday, September 08, 2022", "text": "My mother used to complain that my dad was not very progressive — he preferred to live in the past — everything from the past was better in his eyes and she didn’t think that way.  My mother embraced most modern innovations.  So, growing up I enjoyed lots of modern things in our home and never really looked back at “the good old days”.  I remember her telling me how exciting it was when Fritos first came on the market.  I don’t ever remember having fresh squeezed orange juice— why bother when you could buy frozen and reconstitute it.  My mom was the modern convenience queen.I also remember her talking about her father, my grandfather.  He was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a first generation American born to Welsh immigrant parents.  He was born in 1896 and the last most exciting thing to happen to him before his death in 1969 was that he got to watch the moon landing.  Upon his death we sat and talked about how much he had seen in his life — his job as a child was to clean the chimneys on the gas lamps in their house — he saw electricity come into the house, and outhouses replaced with indoor plumbing, he rode to school on a horse which was replaced by cars, he worked in the mines but left for the railroad because trains were ‘the thing’.  He lived through a period of great innovation and change like my generation had not seen, until now.My father, while he chose to live in the past, did embrace the modern technology of television and film making.  He started his career in radio and then after his time with Uncle Sam he came home to the new invention of tv.  My mother was crazy about tv, even though she was a huge fan of the radio, and they got their first, very small, tv right before I was born in 1950.  I think it had come to other parts of the country before then but it was brand new in San Antonio, Texas.  I digress.  He then ventured into the wider world of media and movie making — movie making in San Antonio was not an easy thing — and I venture to say that if he were alive today he would be a great podcaster.Looking at all these people and the changes in their lives, I have to look at the changes in mine. You don’t really realize how things have changed until it just smacks you in the face.  I have sewn all my life and I look at the machines I have used from a little black, very heavy portable singerTo the computerized quilting machine I use today.I have embraced all manner of kitchen appliances from hand mixers to fancy stand mixers, crockpots — now programmable, bread machines, rice cookers and the list goes on and on — most of them I have gotten rid of and some I am thinking of replacing because they take less energy than heating up the house. It is a constant circle of homemaking life.So today what is hitting me is our entertainment world.  When my children were small we enjoyed snatching them up after my husband got home on a Friday, going to the video place and renting some movies and getting a pizza from the pizza place next door.  We didn’t have cable, our VCR was a new thing to us, we still used antennas on the roof, our phones were attached to the wall and our houses were not “smart”.It has come to our attention that our television viewing is changing.  Our network channels seem to be changing, diminishing so to speak, being reduced to less and less entertainment and more and more repeats, news and things like game shows.  We rarely watch anything on network tv except our day time drama and a couple of things at night but those shows are going away — either cancelled or going to streaming.  I think, within the next five years we won’t have network tv like we have now.And, I have noticed that my usage of technology has change and become very commonplace for me.  Instead of making lists on paper I make them on my phone, I keep a calendar on my phone and iPad, and today I realized that using an Apple Pencil is just as normal for me as a regular pencil.  Today I just set up my new AirPods so I don’t have to struggle with earbud wires.  All of this is so normal nowadays.I think my mother would have loved it — not sure about my dad — but for me, I prefer to go further into my old age at least being able to function in todays world — everything is computerized, digital and instant.  I had to write a check the other day and couldn’t remember when I wrote one last.  Do I like modern ways.  Yes, why yes I do.  I was bewailing my soap opera going to streaming until I realized I could watch it at my convenience and it won’t be preempted by whatever is going on outside my little world.  So, yes, I am ok with it.  I don’t have cable anymore, I prefer to do streaming, purchase the plans that work for me and enjoy at my leisure.  The same with reading.  I am so spoiled by my kindle and being able to get reading material instantly either from my library or kindle unlimited — it is just amazing to me.I look at my life — from my childhood in the 50’s, teenage hood in the 60’s, adulthood from 70’s on and I am amazed at the changes in my existence as well — maybe not as extreme as my grandfather — but big enough changes. Even though I love learning about the past — especially my family history — I am glad I don’t live there.  I was sad when I realized that television as we know it is changing and I was very reluctant for a hot minute but now, as I explore all the options, I am up for the change.  One change I am sad about about is Queen Elizabeth’s decline.  I am an American but because my great-grandparents were immigrants I was always aware of the “motherland” and I have always identified with the UK as my ancestral home on both sides of my family.  I remember when Queen Elizabeth had her coronation and we were able to watch it on tv — thanks to growing technology —and I loved the carriage she rode it and I love all the pomp and circumstance.   Never one to enjoy traveling, the only place I had ever wanted to visit was England and I was so fortunate to be able to do that in 2005.  I would love to go back but realize that my mobility makes it pretty unlikely that will ever happen but I will say that  part of me felt comfortable and at home.  I hope Her Royal Highness rallies from this latest setback because she isn’t just a national treasure but an international treasure but she is 96 and we have to be realistic here — if not this time it will be one of these times and we must prepare.  So, as I watch the tv waiting for breaking news that I feel certain is coming, I will be researching bread machines.  I had one that I used for years but the shape of the loaf was weird, I inherited one from my mother in law but didn’t need two and now here I am looking for another.  Ugh. I will let you know."},
{"title": "Hit a Snag", "date": "Wednesday, September 07, 2022", "text": "I have been doing a really good job keeping up with my Goodreads 2022 Reading Challenge.Until now.I have started about three books since my last entry and I couldn’t get into any of them so I am starting over today.Yesterday I grabbed an actual physical book that I bought when we were in New Orleans a couple of years ago.  It is called “The Last Madam” by Christine Wiltz.  And yes, it is exactly what it sounds like.  It is the story of Norma Wallace, born at the beginning of the last century, and her introduction to the world of prostitution, underworld and vice in New Orleans — clearly before New Orleans was the tourist attraction it is.  I am sure there are still MANY Norma Wallaces in New Orleans but the town looks different than it is presented in this book which introduces the readers to the history of the historic city on Lake Ponchatrain (which I thought was the ocean when I first say it, BTW).  So far it is an interesting book but I remember why I enjoy reading on my kindle — my left hand just won’t let me hold real books — by the time I got through a chapter, I had to put it down and rest my hand. Note to anybody who is listening — do NOT fall down and break your wrist — you will never be the same.Today I downloaded an e-book called “The Library” by Bella Osborn.  I believe it is a feel good read and that sounds like a good thing.  I don’t know much about it so I will have to get back to you on it but it looks good.I usually read silly little cozy mysteries.  I like to read for pleasure and not to solve the worlds problems.  I don't like things that are going to “haunt” me.  I have read other stuff, like V.C. Andrews and more serious stuff (mostly in my youth) but now, I just seem to gravitate toward light reading.   One of my favorite cozy mystery authors is Hope Callaghan.  I have been reading two of her series and enjoy them a good deal so I decided to try another of her series — The Divine series — and I just couldn’t stay with it.  Maybe at another time but not now.  Then I had downloaded another book that I actually don’t remember doing titled “Murder at the Maples” and I just couldn’t stay with it either.  So, I am going to work with these two that I have started and see how it goes.  I don’t usually read two books at a time but the “Madam” book I am going to read in the pickup line at the middle school and the other one is on my kindle for bedtime.  I have also been trying to figure out how to make my cross stitch easier.  Not that it is hard but I need to find a more comfortable place to actually do it.  I don’t do well doing it in my recliner in front of the tv.  I need room to spread out so I am heading back to the dining room table.  I can see and hear the tv just fine from there and then I can stash my stuff in the stairwell and get it out of sight.  That is the big problem for me with cross stitch — it is my artistic outlet but it can be so messy so I am having to work through that.Ever since I fell over the vacuum cleaner a few months ago my back has been worse.  I don’t know if it is because I have become so sedentary and just am not active enough or if I actually damaged myself.  I think I might have to get it looked at.  Or maybe I am just getting old.  That IS possible! Hahah!Have a wonderful day fine folks and I will be back soon."},
{"title": "The English Bookshop by Janis Wildly", "date": "Wednesday, August 31, 2022", "text": "Just finished another book on my Goodreads challenge list.  This one is titled “The English Bookshop” by Janis Wildy.  It wasn’t on a wish list but rather I just grabbed it off Kindle Unlimited, in a rush, looking for something to read.  It ticked all the boxes — nice cover, words like “English” and “bookshop”, was a reasonable length and stand alone.  It also didnt appear to be a title that was going to try to solve the world’s problems.  I was drawn in from page 1.  It is a delightful read about Lucy, a young women in business with her mother and stepbrother.  Mom is rather selfish and a bit mean spirited and brother is a corporate climber.  Lucy was from a prior marriage and she knew very little about her biological father, especially after he left her and her mother to return to England to pursue a career.Then, one day a letter arrived and informed Lucy that her father had passed on and she had inherited his property.  She felt compelled to pursue this, her mother wanted her to pretend it wasn’t happening.Down the rabbit hole she went — off to England for a life changing week with people she never knew she needed to know.I will leave it at that because you need to read it.It is a light read, maybe a few tears here and there but over all it is a really comfy read and I recommend it completely.  I might even read it again and I might buy the physical book I was so enamored with it.And Trixie says good morning!"},

{"title": "Rainy Day Memories", "date": "Tuesday, August 23, 2022", "text": "I grew up in San Antonio, Texas.  San Antonio is a unique city.  It is old, it is historical, it has a definite Spanish influence (the only place you can buy red tortillas in a grocery store) and it will forever be home.  Now, San Antonio is not well known for its great weather.  It is very tropical which creates beautiful and lush foliage as well as deadly humidity.  It has been known to weather a hurricane or two and the rains are of the monsoon variety — that is to say that when they start they don’t know when to stop.  And the city has a definite flooding problem. But, what I remember most about the weather is how it felt to spend a long rainy day reading library books.  The overhang on our house was deep enough so that we could leave the windows open without the rain coming in and those cool gulf breezes were enough to create the perfect atmosphere for finishing a book in a day.One of my fondest memories was of the last day of school in the 3rd grade, May, 1959.  We had our annual class picnic at San Pedro Springs Park, a very old park with a lot of history.  My favorite library, aptly named the San Pedro Branch Library, was located in the park, facing San Pedro Avenue, a major street into downtown.  We were told we were going to visit the library and, if we had a parent with us, we could obtain our first library card.  I was ecstatic.My mother was with me and I got the coveted card and going to that library, especially during the fall and winter, was my favorite thing to do.  I still remember how it looked and how it smelled and I remember the shelf that housed my favorite reads.  I also remember how we had to pick up my cousin who was doing homework there during one of the famous flooding downpours — it was dark and a bit treacherous and a little exciting. I digress.This park was on the outer edge of a significant neighborhood — Monte Vista — or Laurel Heights as it was called back then.  The houses were actually mansion-like — very old, very large and very impressive.  I used to make up stories about the families who lived in them.  The whole area was, and still is, very impressive and I would still like to live there.Of course, as time went on we started going to school libraries and new branch libraries were built closer to our house and habits changed.  I have, however, visited MY library in recent years and, even though they have moved things around I can still remember the corner where I discovered The Good Master by Kate Seredy and all the books I read by Lois Lenski — like Strawberry Girl —I still have a copy of that from MY library that I forgot to take back and ultimately had to purchase.  The poor book has seen better days, it survived being thrown around, read and re-read, a fire, many moves yet here it is standing the test of time.  And the best thing is — it came from MY library!https://youtu.be/HDpexFHx0Rk"},

{"title": "The Gallery Wall Is Coming Along", "date": "Friday, August 19, 2022", "text": "This morning as the Giant Yorkie took a wee walk, I decided to take some photos of my yard.  I am not sure why because it is the most boring, uneventful area I have ever seen — this part is sans foxes.  The grass isn’t dead — yet —and the bushes have managed to hang on through the miserable hell that was summer in Texas.  The clover, however, has quit blooming as has the verbena growing wild by the back fence.  It is still there but not blooming as profusely as it was in the heat.  Go figure.We are not gardeners.  I never professed to be.  When I was a kid I was allergic to so much that I just had to stay in so I never cultivated an interest AND I am still allergic.  In our former home we had a LOT of landscaping done (here we measure that in $$$ amount) and it proved to be a real chore because we had some sort of a vine with 2” long thorns on it that just wouldn’t go away no matter what we did.  My husband even injected it with roundup and it came back prettier than ever.  So, anyway, when we moved here we decided we wouldn’t do that.  We have kept the flower beds that were existing except for one.  We have kept it to grass and shrubs and stuff like the clover that comes back on it’s own.  It is over half an acre and that is as much mowing as my husband can handle.  So, my yard is never going to look like the gardens I see here but it is lovely in it’s own prairie like way.Moving on, I think I mentioned that I have a very dark and dismal stairwell that is just icky.  It isn’t dirty and it isn’t scary it is just straight up, steep, characterless and BEIGE.  So, I decided to frame my cross stitch projects that have been languishing in a box for absolutely years and hang them in this stairwell to add some sort of interest — even if people say “what was she thinking!”  Well, that is what I was thinking.  I have chosen to do them in bamboo hoops with no finish on them, hang them on cord from cute little push pins.  I have done a few, I have a few more to do and I added a couple of other things that were already framed differently.So, here is the work in progress —Yes, I know there are two photos of the same thing, I tried to get a better angle on the second one because I was standing on the second step.  If I stood right in front of it there was no way I could take the photo.  So, yes, anyway, I have about six more to do but I need to return some of the hoops I bought for smaller ones and buy some more felt for backing.I guess I could take close up photos of each one so you could tell what they are.  Maybe tomorrow.  So, that is what I have been doing this morning.  I really like the little pushpins I got off Amazon.  They are different shapes and different colors even though they are finished in a natural way.  Hopefully this will brighten up that space or at least make it less boring.  We will see how many get knocked off the wall!Happy Friday, all!"},

Well……Daughter went back to  work on Monday but granddaughter isn’t back in school yet so she has been here with me.  We have been busy.Monday we went to lunch.  My husband likes to eat shrimp at Rockfish so we did.Tuesday the grand girl wanted to go to the movie so we did.  She treated us (thanks Mom) and we saw Top Gun Maverick.  It was her fourth time to see it.  I remember being like that with movies when I was her age - I mean, I saw West Side Story as many times as my mother would let me.  But that was West Side Story — this was a military movie!  Oh, well — there were a lot of handsome guys in the flick so maybe that was the draw!Wednesday we went to Target for a few things.Thursday we went to Michaels and started binge watching Stranger Things — her choice not mine.  She has seen the entire series.  What can I say.Today we finished the first series and she has gone home and I am going to make pizza for dinner.I did a couple of different things this week.  I got a tip from Pinterest about storing folded plastic grocery bags in an empty tissue box in the bathroom or wherever you need it.  I use those plastic bags to line my trash cans — do you?  So, having them where I need them is advantageous and this works well.And, we went to Michaels yesterday so I could purchase some wooden embroidery hoops to frame some of my needlework.  I did one this morning.  Unfortunately, no matter how much I ironed, I couldn’t remove a crease that was created when I washed it.  Had I known, I wouldn’t have washed it.  So, anyway, here it isThe second photo is in the dreary, dismal stairwell.  I intend to fill it with needlework.  I think it will be cute.  I hope.  At least I am hanging them on push pins so there won’t be huge nail holes in the wall!I also finished reading Book Lovers by Emily Henry.  It was really good and I enjoyed it.  So, now to start my weekend — pizza and “Beyond Salem”.  Hahaha!  I am getting so old."},

{"title": "Wildlife", "date": "Friday, July 29, 2022", "text": "Taking a small break from housecleaning posts and before I start a rant  on “aesthetics” I thought I would share some photos of our very unkempt deck and all the activity that goes on out there.This deck was here when we moved in and we added the rail because it is a pretty steep drop off the backside and we do have children around here and didn’t want any broken bones.  We also added the lights.  And we never go out there because it is just not in a convenient place.  You have to trek down the yard or go out through the garage — it just isn’t very useable.  I think patios and decks and things of that nature should be convenient to the back door.  This isn’t.And then there are the mosquitos.  I try to be kind to all of God’s creatures but would I go straight to hell if I suggested all the mosquitos just drop dead?  I am sure they are useful in some way, just not sure what.I digress.Anyway, our deck is a very active place both day and night.  Our neighbor’s house has been denoted as a songbird sanctuary by the Audubon Society and trust me, the birds don’t stay in their yard.  They also lay claim to the foxes and again, the foxes don’t stay in their yard.So, here are some of our birds — please don’t judge the shape of the deck — it will be cleaned up when it isn’t so hot.They absolutely love that pot saucer and we have been keeping it filled.  I mean, it IS 107 here.And, of course, I don’t want to leave these out —So yes, our yard is very interesting.  The birds have different personalities — we have about 100 photinias out there and the cardinals live in half of them and the jays live in the other half and they don’t get along.  Actually nobody gets along with the jays.  They chase everything off.  Occasionally they lose to one of the foxes though.  So far we have seen jays, cardinals, sparrows, and doves.  They are as much fun to watch as the foxes.  And they absolutely love the water."},
{"title": "Just Popping In to ….", "date": "Thursday, July 28, 2022", "text": "Let you know how my new “PLAN” is going.  I spent some time yesterday visiting/signing up for Flylady — again.  I can’t follow her plan exactly because it doesn’t make sense to me really.  But, I did take a few things away from my visit.One thing is, it is going to take awhile to establish new habits — about 28 days supposedly.  So, I am starting with my morning routine and my bedtime routine.  These are both pretty predictable and not at all complicated or time consuming.  The hardest thing about the morning routine is actually doing it.  I timed myself and it takes less than 15 minutes to make the bed, wash face, do makeup (which is extremely minimal) and get dressed.  I think I can stay after it for that long.  The thing I have to do now is establish my “swish and swipe” routine as laid out by Flylady.  On my Target run tomorrow I will be stocking up on cleaning products so that I can have what I need in each bathroom and not have to run all over the house looking for what I need.  I just have to decide between wet wipes or spray cleaner and paper towels.  Since Covid began I have been keeping paper towels in the bathrooms instead of constantly having to wash hand towels so spray cleaner might work well plus those canisters of wet wipes tend to dry out so easily.  Once I get things stocked up I think it will be easy to get on the “swish and swipe” bandwagon.  Plus, I am going to go back to using drop in toilet bowl cleaners.  I used to use them but with kids I quit but no more kids and the dog is too short to drink out of the toilet so I think my drop in toilet bowl cleaner time has come.  Any suggestions as to the best brand?I know, TMI.I have read a couple of articles about dusting and it seems that the best way to dust is to use your vacuum. My husband has done that for years but I stuck to a dust cloth.  However, today I used my Dyson stick vacuum with the attachments and it did make it much easier.  I SAW (clean it when you see it) that dusting needed to happen in my living room so I used this method and it took no time and the physical outlay was minimal.  Plus, maybe lifting that vacuum canister will help me get some arm strength back.  Now I have to take some stuff upstairs and then run the vacuum over the carpet in the living room.And hang the wreath back on the door.  Don’t ask.  One of those annoying things — took it down in December to put the Christmas wreath up and it has been on my dining room table ever since.  We definitely have a big problem with drop and run!  It goes back up in a bit.  It is very easy to recognize where my housekeeping problems are and it is mostly because we just have a tendency to lay things down wherever.  I don’t know if I can change my husband but I can change myself. So, I felt like I got a good start.  I am beginning to readily recognize where changes need to be made and I am actively trying to figure out ways to make the changes while making it easier on me and not so labor intensive.Yeah, that is it so far!  I am going to start my evening routine early this evening because I want to stitch some and if I stitch first and get tired the evening routine won’t happen. Plus, I am going to have to force the “shine my sink” aspect of the evening routine.  Hubs does the dishwasher at night so I don’t know how shiny my sink will be in the morning but I am going to make the effort.  I can’t believe I am doing this at my age but I do feel better having moved around. I think sitting has just taken it’s toll on me and if I force myself to get up and move around, and learning when to sit down and rest, I will get some of my strength back and maybe beat down the depression that I fear is lurking in the background.Oh, we also went to lunch at a new restaurant called “Shuck Me”.  Racy.  But, not racy — just a shrimp place that replaced one of our favorite barbecue restaurants that decided to close.  It is ok and we will go back especially with coupons!"},
{"title": "Puttering, Tidying, and a Solution to the Mystery!", "date": "Wednesday, July 27, 2022", "text": "Ok, I have a new plan.  Ever since I broke my arm a year and a half ago or so, I have become much more sedentary.  It is easy to do when your knees hurt and your feet hurt and your arm doesn’t work and it has become my new “state of being”.  I feel my physical strength and stamina ebbing away and, honestly, I think I am harboring some simmering depression.  I am not happy about any of this because it is taking a toll on everything.So, as I said in an earlier post, I am making an attempt to accommodate these physical changes so I will be more apt to move around and regain some strength and stamina instead of just sitting around crying into the cookie jar.  Yes, cookies are my weakness and my go-to comfort food.  Aren’t they good and so convenient!  I digress.So, I did a fair amount of thinking yesterday about my mom, how I grew up, how she approached things (when she was young and well) and I realized that I am holding those standards as the norm and not taking into account the differences in, well, almost everything.When I was a child my mother was death on a clean house.  When I say clean I mean she bleached everything.  I still can’t stand the smell of bleach, by the way.  She would clean house daily.  We didn’t have a washer so she washed clothes in the huge, cast iron kitchen sink, hung them out, starched, sprinkled and ironed them all in a day.  She cooked all our food from scratch.  She was a domestic powerhouse.  She was also 5’1” and weighed 108.  She was like Peter Pan.Our house was also 950 sq. ft. of post-war tract housing — two bedrooms, one bathroom, living room/dining combo and kitchen.  My house is 3900 square feet on two levels — four bedrooms, four bathrooms, living room, dining room, kitchen, breakfast room, game room and media room.  Over kill much?  Uh, yeah, but I needed to move closer to my kids and my husband would only consider it if there was something in it for him and this house has a 5 car garage.  So, you can see how this went.There is no way I can clean this house every day.  And we are messy — by “we” I mean “he”.  So…….I need a plan.  And I have one.Remember “Fly Lady”?  Yeah, I didn’t get it either.  It simply didn’t make any sense to me but there are a couple of things about it that I did find useful.The main thing is “get dressed to your shoes”.  I am positive that if I get dressed — all the way dressed — first thing in the morning — hair, makeup, etc — I am much more productive.  And the whole premise is establishing a habit — like making the bed when you get out of it — even if you fall out of it.  That sort of thing.I am also a firm believer in doing laundry daily and not waiting until you have everything in the house to wash.  That is just too labor intensive.  My husband doesn’t agree with my thoughts on it, he says it is wasteful, and I reminded him that they have water levels to choose from for that very reason.  I plan to continue with my way of doing laundry.  So, anyway, I am calling my method of housecleaning Puttering, Tidying and Clean It When You See It.  I am going to devote a day a week to sprucing up the two bedrooms that are guest rooms and nobody goes into.  They need to be dusted and vacuumed and that shouldn’t take too long.  I might even been able to get both done in one day.The study — my husbands space — well, there is no hope for it but I do need to throw things away on my desk.  Yes, I have a little corner of the study for my own.  Maybe I can set an example for him.  hahah! I have been setting an example for 50 years and his mother’s hoarder tendencies are just too strong for me to overcome.Then, I need to spend a day, or an hour out of a day, sprucing up the entry and dining room.  Again, we don’t really use those rooms much so it shouldn’t be such a big deal.That leaves the majority of time spent on our main living space which requires something daily.  It may be dusting or running the vacuum because Trixie likes to carry kibble all over.  Sometimes I think she thinks she is a squirrel storing up for the winter.  Anyway, I think I can just about manage this plan if I don’t let my mother into my brain.  She was 30 when she was doing her domestic chores — I am 72.  I think it is like comparing apples to oranges.  I could do the same when I was 30 with a smaller house and lots less stuff.  But, that was then and this is now and I think I have to adapt and adjust and change my way of thinking.Today starts the great clean out.  It is really time to do some purging.  I am feeling good about it and don’t think it will take too long.  I also have a plan for some of the multitude of fabric that I have.  I used to quilt.  I don’t anymore but I have lots of fabric.  I also, sometimes, seem to be sensitive to tissues so, at one point, I made some flannel hankies and I love them.  I googled what kind of fabric to make regular hankies out of and lo and behold it said nice quilting cotton!  I mean, handkerchief linen would be great but I have LOTS of cotton so I am going to make handkerchiefs.  And maybe some cup towels.  It is better than just donating the fabric and I think I can get my head around  sewing four hems.  Even if I do them by hand which should be relaxing.  So, that is on my list of things to do.  The hurdle is making myself do it because my joints hurt so much but they aren’t hurting any less by just sitting — in fact, I think they are worse.Now, I think I have figured out why we have both fallen out of the bed.  Recently we bought new beds — we sleep in twins because our sleep requirements are completely different — and we bought adjustable bed frames.  We have both slept with our heads raised and I think it is putting us at a weird angle and it makes it hard to turn over.  I am a side sleeper and I think the other night I had slid way down in the bed and when I tried to turn over I was on the angle and I think that is why I fell.  Last night I slept flat and didn’t have any problems so I think it had to do with the bed being raised.  I mean, seriously, I have been sleep in a bed without sides for about  70 years and don’t ever remember falling out — now, with these new beds we both fall out?  Coincidence?  I think not.Ok, off to putter and tidy!  Have a wonderful day!"},

But, not back to sleep.  That didn’t happen until after 5 a.m.  I laid there for 2 hours trying to figure out why we are falling around so much.  I mean, we aren’t THAT old.Or are we?  I have never known how to behave properly for my age regardless of what my age was.  Maybe it is normal but I will say I don’t like it.And I promise I won’t criticize my husband anymore.  Well, I will try not to."},

It is another hot one here in North Texas.  We have had almost 30 days of over 100 degree weather.  It is miserable.  And for some reason my allergies are raging.  I try not to go out except to take the dog out but we are having some bad wildfires out west of us and I am sure we are getting smoke and all manner of misery from that so I am sure that is contributing to my runny nose and itchy eyes. Covid is also up in our area — in the red zone for Dallas and close for us the next county over.  So, we are being encouraged to wear masks again and limit where we go.  I have never changed much from what we have been doing for the last two years so I am not too worried but I am going to get a second booster before school starts and we are, once again, in the company of kids.I have been doing a little online shopping.  I have been thinking about how to hang all my little cross stitch projects and I am thinking about displaying them in hoops on the wall of my stairwell which is dark and gloomy.  I know, it will get dusty and I really hate that but I am not sure about actually framing them either.  All those holes in the wall!  I did the two pieces for my Bean’s birthday and I really liked how they looked and I am sort of intrigued with decorating the hoops for display.  So, I bought some decorative push pins to use to hang them.  My thought process is to use lightweight wooden hoops, attach ribbon to the metal screw part and hang them on push pins so I bought these —They are cute and pretty hefty so we will see.  I think it would look nice and absolutely nobody really sees this stairwell but me, the hubs and the Bean.I also bought a book.  A friend of mine acquired the same book and the art attracted me so I bought one too!Frederick is very cute and loveable.  The story is classic and I enjoyed it. I love the art — I mean, it is a well known fact that I do, in fact, choose my books by their covers.  I am shallow like that.  Anyway, this will go on my children’s book shelf and hopefully my g-kids will like it too.  My little planner came.Sorry about the shadow but I am just too lazy at the moment to get up and take a proper picture.  The inside is decorated with the little bees and I am pleased with it.  I need an elastic something to use as a band so I will come up with something for that, I think I have some gold stretchy cord upstairs.  It a multiple year calendar — starts in August and goes through December 2023.  I think it will serve me well.  I had one like it previously and I don’t know why I quit using it but I think I will stick with this one.I have been working on the Williamsburg cross stitch but it is very slow going.  I am used to working on 14 ct. Aida and that is the count of my choice but this is either 16 or 18 and I am actually having trouble seeing it, especially in the evening so I am either going to have to change my stitchy spot or the time of the day I stitch!  I would show it to you but I have gone about this in a strange manner and I really don’t have much to show.  Maybe tomorrow.  I tried gridding the fabric with a pen but it is so small that the point of the pen was too thick and didn’t make a nice neat line so I tried what I call “reverse gridding”.  I am sure this isn’t something I actually thought up, I am sure other people have done it too but I marked the center of my fabric and then I marked the center of the pattern (it is a 4 page pattern so I taped it together).  Then, I highlight the 10 X 10 square grid that represented the center of the piece and completed it, color changes and all.  Then I moved to the left and did the next 10 X 10 grid, marking it off with a yellow highlight when I was done with the whole grid.  So, I actually did one whole row across the center of the piece — that is why you can’t tell much about it — and I have moved down to the next row and starting from the left I am working my way across from left to right with the next 10 X 10 grids and marking them off.  It is taking a long time because I am finishing each grid completely before I move on so there are color changes and all that.  Plus — I can’t see the dang holes!  But, I am not giving up and I have another kit much like it to start when I am done with this one!  Yikes!  Note to self for future purchases — make sure you like the size of the fabric! Haha!I am over half way done with the book “The Chocolate House” by Paula Brackston.  It is the second in a series of four and it is pretty engaging.  I have read reviews about the third book that aren’t so stellar but we will see — this one is pretty good though.I have spent part of today and yesterday cleaning up my bedroom.  Things had gotten out of hand in there — you know, just setting things down instead of putting them where they belong — we are both good at that — and the dust has been thriving.  So, I pick this time of great allergy distress to go in and eliminate the dust.  It will be helpful in the long run but every time I go in there to do something I come out sneezing and wheezing.  So, since we aren’t going anywhere anyway, I am just taking my time.  If it takes me three days to get it done, well, so be it.  I am also very aware I need to purge my bookcase.  I have run out of space and I need to make some room even though I am using my kindle exclusively right now since it is easier to hold than big, awkward books. But, I have made good progress and tossed a bunch of stuff and will continue until everything is where it needs to be — I am almost there.  Over all I feel like I have been productive in spite of my knees hurting and me just wanting to sit and read.  I have been forcing myself to get up and get things done and I think it might actually be helping my mobility!  Yay!"},
{"title": "Old Dog, New Tricks?  Not this Bow Wow!", "date": "Thursday, July 14, 2022", "text": "I have always thought of myself as reasonably forward thinking.  I LOVE technology — when I was a child we listened to the radio a lot because my parents were of the radio generation and there were still a lot of radio programs on.  I never knew a time that I didn’t have television in my house and I loved it.  Enter computers and cell phones and streaming entertainment and I am all for it.  Even an avid reader, I have embraced e-readers and totally love the idea that I can access my library and use my card through my  iPad.  Genius!However, there is one thing I just can’t seem to get my head around and that is digital planning.  Now, my children are grown and I don’t need to keep up with quite as much as I used to but I do need to maintain a calendar for various appointments and things I just want to make note of.I have tried all manner of paper planners, even making my own from a moleskin and again using a binder. I have an affinity for Erin Condren planners, it seems, but carrying them around is getting more and more difficult.  I have even turned to a wall calendar that hangs on my pantry but I keep forgetting it is there!I have tried using my Google calendar but it is annoying because when you look at the calendar it only shows a dot when an entry has been made and you have to get into the calendar to figure out what the dot stands for.So, I bit the bullet and signed up for Zinnia.  It is a digital planner complete with the ability to apply stickers, sync to my iPad and do all sorts of arty things and for a while I was loving it.  Until now.  It is time to add all the upcoming school dates for both Bean and my daughter, upcoming medical appointments that are already creeping into the fall and I am dreading doing all of that on my iPad.  So….I ordered a small pocket calendar from Orange Circle Studio.  It is small enough to slip into a purse and it isn’t anything fancy.I don’t know why I have so much trouble with planners.  I suspect it is because I really don’t need one to control my life — I just need it write down the upcoming events and I feel like I remember things better if I write it down.  With a pen.  Now the Google calendar will alert you to something coming up which is good but I still struggle with it.So, I have the little book above complete with it’s little bees on the way.  I wonder how long I will stick with it.  What do you use?"},
{"title": "Update on the Very Terrible Sunday", "date": "Tuesday, July 12, 2022", "text": "Good morning! I want to thank you Granny Marigold and you Angela for your concern and kind words in regards to the very terrible Sunday.Trixie went to the vet for her regular annual inoculation update and we discussed the events of Saturday and the visit to the very expensive ER.  The vet, a new doctor to me, checked her all over again and found absolutely nothing amiss.  He came to the conclusion that she was having an adverse reaction to the stove repairman who was in the house at the time she began her weird behavior.  Since she didn’t really react to the man being here, no vying for attention or barking or anything, I didn’t consider that but he feels she was having an anxiety attack.  Just what I need, a dog with anxiety attacks.  Well, everybody else has them so she fits in quite well.So, she is ok.  She has allergic eyes though and I am supposed to put drops in both eyes three times a day.  I got one drop in one eye last night and we called it good.  Today I am going to bathe her and trim her hair and get it out of her eyes and maybe that will make it easier.  It is a bit difficult to hold her down, get the hair out of her eyes and manage that tiny drop bottle so…..I will figure it out.In regards to my husband.  My husband is stubborn.  I love him but after years of trying to deal with it I am on a short tether.  He is diabetic and it is getting harder to control.  We are on a special diet (well, he cheats as often as he can and then doesn’t understand why his numbers are high)  he is supposed to exercise (he doesn’t) and he has a tendency to go hypoglycemic in the night which we have pretty much sorted out but it did cause us some huge problems in the recent past.  I could write a book.  What he does have is diabetic neuropathy in his feet.  His feel are almost totally numb which makes walking barefoot very difficult.  He also can’t walk in house slippers.  So when he first gets up in the morning and tries to navigate to the bathroom and the closet to get dressed, he is a wobbly mess.  If he doesn’t sit on the side of the bed and wake fully up, it is all complicated by the fact that he is very sound asleep.  It is all very scary and made worse by the fact that he tends to not remember any of it.  Cognitively I think he is fine — he reads and does math and problem solves but he is deaf as a doornail and wobbly.  And, not to make it about me, I am a nervous wreck.I have very bad arthritis and am fatigued most of the time just trying to get through the basics of the day.  I am constantly trying to find ways to make things easier but at the end of the day I tire very easily and I need sleep.  So, all of the shenanigans of Saturday came together to completely do me in.  I didn’t mean to be a whiney mess but at the moment that was all I could do.  Trixie slept fine on Sunday night and so did I so yesterday was much better.  We had a slow start to the day, took her to the vet, went to an early dinner and shopping at the pet store.  She was bushed from getting her shots so she was out for the evening and we just enjoyed some tv watching and made it an early night.This morning I am feeling better — husband only marginally wobbly this morning so I am hoping for a good day.  Going to Home Depot to get some soaker hoses to put around the foundation of the house because it is so dry our foundation is shifting and doors aren’t closing.  Then I am going to take a self care trip to Sephora and come home and maybe indulge in a little stitching.  We are also under a heat emergency here so for the afternoon we are shutting off the lights, closing the blinds, turning the a/c up and the ceiling fans on.  My house tends to be dark anyway so I am fortunate that I can stitch with a small light that attaches to my hoop and that I can read on my kindle.  It also sounds like a really good nap time. I am just praying our grid doesn’t go down and also praying we can elect somebody who will figure it out.So onward I go and just a funny to let you know it isn’t so funny here in Texas right now!Have a wonderful day and thanks again, ladies, I appreciate you more than you will ever know!"},
{"title": "Limit Reached", "date": "Sunday, July 10, 2022", "text": "We all have our limits.  Me included.  And I have reached mine.  I am an old gal now — grew up in the 50’s and 60’s, worked at a job, married, raised children, took care of aging parents and here I am trying to take care of a very stubborn man with some limitations, a very stubborn dog and myself with my body falling apart at a rather rapid rate.Yesterday the dog got weird.  I would say got sick but I am not sure about that.  She was pacing and panting and refused to lay down.  I figured it was a recurring UTI so I picked her up and took her to the animal emergency room.  $333 later they couldn’t find anything wrong with her and sent me home with the dog and a prescription for pain pills.  I gave her one at midnight and without going through the night hour by hour let’s just say neither of us got any sleep.  I have been up since — well yesterday morning — and she is still pacing.  She isn’t panting and she has drunk water and eaten food and done “her business”. Yet, she is still pacing the floor.  I could take her back to the emergency clinic but she already had an appointment planned for tomorrow at her regular doctor.  I have no idea what is wrong with her or what to do about it — I just know that I don’t need too many more $333 bills.Then, to complicate things, my husband was trying to get out of bed to use the bathroom and he got tangled up in the cover and face planted on the floor.  He has hurt his face, his thumb and his neck.  He won’t go see about it.  He is very stubborn.  After we got him off to the bathroom, I followed him in there and it is a good thing I did because he almost fell again.  I managed to get him down on the floor and told him to just be still while I got his glucose monitor because I was sure his glucose was too low.  Actually, it was perfect.  We managed to get him back on his feet and then he went back to bed.  I was, of course, still up.  I am not good with stress and this is bordering on too much.  I just seriously feel like I am going to have a running fit — a ‘hissy fit’ as we say here in the south.  I am so tired and the dog won’t quit walking and my husband thinks I am overreacting."},
{"title": "Waiting, waiting, waiting", "date": "Saturday, July 09, 2022", "text": "Waiting for the repairman.  Supposed to be here between 8 and noon.  Anytime now would be just fine.  Hubs makes breakfast every morning but he has never made the oatmeal in the microwave so I was prepared to be on cereal duty today but he decided to give it a go and I think he preferred it to cooking it on the stove.  He said something like “it turned out ok and beats standing over a hot stove”. He cracks me up. So, now I am just waiting.  Been out with the Trixster several times, picked up the kitchen counter some, and am now enjoying a cup of coffee.  I never used to drink coffee but I have developed a taste for it.  I buy Cafe DuMonde and really like it.  I used to use cream or half and half but it gives me indigestion so now I just use milk and no sugar.Now if somebody would just bring me a beignet.  Oh wait, you can buy the mix at the store— maybe when the stove is fixed.Night before last we had three foxes on the deck.  Last night we had one.  I think there might have been a second out of camera shot but here he is — I think it is Boo.He was very interested in something on the other side of the deck.  Maybe Bam? I think I might leave them a dog biscuit out tonight although from what I understand they prefer canned dog food.  I can’t believe I am even thinking about that.I have been working on my cross stitch but it is going very slowly.  I am using a new technique —something I dreamed up although I am sure it isn’t an original thought— I am completing each square of 10 X 10 squares at a time — makes for a lot of thread changes — and then, when I have completed the square I am highlighting it on the chart.  Sort of reverse gridding.  It is going well but I could go faster if I wasn’t doing it this way but this makes it easier to keep track of where I am.I didn’t stitch at all yesterday because night before last my left hand ached pretty badly from holding the hoop.  I am back to using just a regular embroidery hoop because the q-snap hurts my hand and I can’t stay with it as long.  So, I gave it a rest last night and was looking forward to spending some time this morning stitching.  However, I woke up at 4 a.m. and my OTHER hand had a terrible cramp in it and I couldn’t straighten it out.  I have no clue what I did to it but it wasn’t good.  Since I have “severe and extreme arthritis” in my left hand (I had absolutely no clue until the orthopedist told me) and my left hand is my non-dominant hand, it would make sense that I have arthritis in my right hand as well.  Up until now I have had absolutely no issues with my hands — my knees, hips, feet and back are another story — but not my hands.  Well, I guess it had to start sometime.  Blah.  I don’t care.  I am not giving up stitching.I managed to get some reading done last night before falling asleep.  I am reading “The Chocolate House” (or something like that) by Paula Brackston — a sequel to “The Little Shop of Found Things”.  As I said previously, I am not into fantasy stories but the first one held my interest — not sure about the second however — but it seems to have grabbed me and I am all in.  I am not sure I am ready for the main character, Xanthe, the go down the time traveling rabbit hole (portal) again but it looks like that is where she is headed.  I will see how this one goes — not sure if I can handle #3 and #4 but I might be so far in that I will absolutely HAVE to read them as well.  That is the thing about a series, isn’t it?  Well, I am afraid I am going to require a second cup of coffee before I can do the things.  I am thrown off schedule because of this repairman situation so I don’t even know what things I want to do — other than stitch.  So, I guess it is going to be a “fly by the seat of my britches” day! That seems to be everyday for me these days.  Oh well, it all eventually gets done anyway.See you later!"},
{"title": "Here We Go Again!", "date": "Friday, July 08, 2022", "text": "A number of years ago, in our very first completely new house, we had the builder grade stove short out when a pot boiled over.  We replaced it with a new, 30” Wolf gas cooktop.  It was great.We moved.Our current house had a gas cooktop as well.  We had a boil over — again — and shorted out a burner.  I guess I should add here that I am clearly not a very effective cook — I do much better with my crock pot.  Anyway,  we replaced that cooktop with another Wolf 30” gas cooktop.  Today I did something stupid.  I poured boiling water into a mason jar and it cracked.  Now, the bottom didn’t fall out and there wasn’t a huge flow of water before I realized what happened and put the jar in the sink.  There was a little water on the cooktop but nothing near the burner or the power knob.  We were told when we bought this unit that it was not going to be damaged due to boil overs because of the way it is sealed.We didn’t think anything about it until my husband tried to turn on the burner for some unknown reason and it wouldn’t light.  Also, the gfi plug next to the stove kept tripping.  We can’t get it to stay on.  There is no power on that side of the room.  So, now we have a call out to the repair person who will be here tomorrow.  If somebody gets freed up today they might be by today. I have never used this company before but they seemed nice and professional.  I am so totally annoyed.  This is the third stove that has gone kaput on me! And this one is only 4 years old!  I am ready to give up gas, go back to electric except that we don’t have a 220 line under the cabinet to plug into which would, of course, required an electrician and I have no idea how many $$.  So, sandwiches for dinner anybody?"},
{"title": "Hot Shot in Savannah and a New Start", "date": "Thursday, July 07, 2022", "text": "Last night, in the midst of another horrendous allergy attack, I finished my latest title Hot Shot in Savannah by Hope Callaghan.  As usual, Callaghan didn’t disappoint with this latest cozy mystery.  While Callaghan’s books are easy to read and pretty predictable she always has a bit of a twist that brings in the unexpected.  I enjoy these books, as well as one of her other series The Garden Girls Mysteries.  They are just so relaxing.  And apparently there is a new one in the works.I am now starting another in my queue titled Secrets of the Chocolate House by Paula Brackston.  It is the 2nd in a series that began with The Little Shop of Found Things.  Time travel isn’t really my thing, not much into fantasy but I did enjoy the first books so I am going give the second a go.  You can’t help but get drawn in by the cover!If my allergies stay at bay I have some housework to do and I have a dog to wash.  If they don’t stay settled down I will read between sneezing.  And stitch.  I didn’t stitch at all yesterday because we were out and about in this life-ending heat.  I used to love summer back when I was a teenager and there was adventure around every corner.  Now the adventure is getting around the corner without falling out because of the heat.  Autumn is, however, my fav season even though it lasts about a minute here so I guess I am really beginning to like winter.  I can’t believe I said that but….Oh, and I got new glasses even though they won’t be ready for a couple of weeks.  What do you think?They have a little bling on the side and I am not a blingy person but thinking I might should put one foot out of my comfort zone.  They are comfortable and not too dark and not too bold so I am looking forward to getting them.  My script changes were mostly in my right eye and I can tell it so I am glad I went ahead and went. Ok, enough of this.  Time to drink the coffee and do the things!See you soon!"},
{"title": "Well, well, well…….now we know and cross stitch update and a little reading update", "date": "Wednesday, July 06, 2022", "text": "As most everybody who reads this blog knows, we have urban foxes that live under our deck and frolic in our yard.  We do not feed them, however, because it seems that being fed by humans destroys their fear of humans and reduces their dependence on themselves.  They tend to disappear from time to time and we worry where they go.  We all know the fate of Bubbles. We now have answers.My husband was out messing with the sprinkler system that has a mind of its own and he struck up a conversation with our neighbor.  Seems she was up all night worried that her yard was going to catch fire with the fireworks going off across the street.  She also said the fireworks were driving her foxes crazy.  HER foxes.  Hmmppp—I beg to differ.  I mean the fact that they use my yard as their personal potty should give me some rights — right?  Then she went on to tell my husband that they feed them and have for a couple of years.  Fox food!! I didn’t even know they manufactured fox food.  Well, they do.  One of the foxes even waits for her on her patio.  But she doesn’t talk to them she declared.  I don’t think the lack of conversation means a thing, do you?  So, anyway, they aren’t disappearing, they are just going into food comas.So, now that we can relax about the foxes I can focus on other things, like my total obsession with cross stitching these days.I have been cross stitching for years but put it aside for a long while only to pick it up again right before I broke my arm.  Well, during that time of healing, when I couldn’t do much of anything with my arm, the desire to cross stitch just grew so once out of the cast I got right back to it.Now, I am having a bit of an issue with it — I tend to not do things in short bursts, I like to sit down, get cozy, get a cuppa and a movie and just veg out on what I am doing.  Unfortunately my arm/hand won’t let me do it.  I was told when I had my release appointment that I have extensive and severe arthritis in my left hand and the break must have just made it all worse.  So, now I have an issue with my hand going to sleep and getting numb so my stitching sessions are shorter.  And, apparently Trixie doesn’t like to see me stitch so she interrupts constantly which is just so annoying.  Anyway, I am not able to just jump in and enjoy like I would like to.  Oooohhhh, a nice rainy day would make it so much better too!  That is not going to happen here in Texas anytime soon I am afraid.So, I have been working on one of the kits I bought in Williamsburg.  It is a cute kit — the Governors Palace — and the colors are really pretty.  I was going to grid my fabric but it is 16 ct and was hard to do with the pen and the sulky sliver just tests my patience so I gridded on the chart instead!What do I mean?  Well, I found the center of the fabric and the center of the pattern and I drew a red line around that first square on the chart and completed it.  Then I moved to the right and did the same.  So, my chart looks gridded but my work does not.  It has been difficult not to just continue stitching but rather stay in the block and finish it as I am completely finishing each block as I got (there is no backstitching).  I tried parking my thread and that didn’t work for me — I got all tangled up.  And I am learning that pin stitches on such small count isn’t easy either so I am back to my old methods.  It is working out well, though because I am able to keep up with where I am as I am highlighting each grid box as I finish.  I will say it is taking forever though.  This will be the finished product.And in reading news, I am almost finished with #18 in the Made in Savannah series by Hope Callaghan.  I really like this series even though it is very predictable.  They are easy to read and hold my interest and are, of course, set in one of my favorite places — Savannah.  I recommend the series as something fun to read, light reading, and nothing offensive.My daughter is back in grad school for the second time and is taking a course with some interesting reading selections.  One is a book called “The Hemmings of Monticello”.  There is mention of people that I believe are ancestors, perhaps lateral, of mine, so I bought the book.  It is a chunkster, though, so I am going to tackle it one chapter at a time. I think it is engaging though so it might go quicker than I think.I have also borrowed from Kindle Unlimited the sequel to The Little Shop of Found Things.  It is a series as well with four in the series so I am going to start on #2.  Then I purchased “Book Lovers” because it seems to be the thing everybody is reading right now.  I am going to have to change my reading habits though because it seems when I lay down in bed I fall asleep quicker than I used to so I am not getting as far as I would like.  So, I might have to sit up to read at night.  Darn.So, now I am off to pick our new glasses.  My script hasn’t changed much so the doctor said I didn’t have to get them but I know what will happen if I don’t—when I go back next year it will have changed enough that it will be a huge change in prescription and that will take some getting used to so I am going to get the new prescription.  I don’t like getting new glasses.  I don’t like picking them out.  I certainly don’t like the high cost once a year — I might keep my current frames and just get new lenses.  We will see.  It will be an adventures.  Right. I will let you know."},

We made it about 3/4 of the way through before the Bean started fading fast so we bid them adieu and promised to continue the movie later.A good time was had by all.  And here are some photos—Olive not having fun but the Littlest granddaughter is terrified of dogs — and Olive is a lot of dogThe gift opening begins — a gift card to Coldstone Creamery — yum!The grand boy and the grand little — he is out girled!Cupcakes —Poor sad, sleepy GrampsCake and decorative platesEldest grand girl and the BeanThe requisite balloonsSo, yes, that is what went on yesterday.  It was fun and it was nice having all my grandchildren under one roof and I enjoyed hearing all the giggles and carrying on.  It was a good time."},

I have a box of projects that I have done over the years yet never did anything with them, just put them in the box, but this was done for a reason — a certain somebody’s birthday.The Bean is all into the Marvel movies.  Her favorites are Spider Man and Loki.  She is not at all impressed that her great-grandfather drew for Marvel at one time.  I guess that is just too ancient for her.  But, anyway, since I am into the cross stitch again I decided to see what I could find for some room decor.I decided on these less-than-realistic renderings.  I think they turned out cute but I have to say I almost gave up on baby Spider-Man.  All that black thread.  And scattered single stitches.  But, I carried on and completed it.This is the first time I have framed anything in hoops.  I thought the look would be good for the young super hero’s room plus it doesn’t required a lot of hanging apparatus.  I am sure her interest will fade and these will end up in a box in a closet somewhere which is appropriate — I hope she doesn’t hang them in her first apartment!  But, I was intrigued with the process of doing the framing and aside from impaling myself with the needle multiple times trying to attach the felt to the back, it went very well.  I will do it again.I think I might be more apt to frame some of the things in the box now that I have tried this.  From what I see on any number of places on the ‘net, you can really dress up the hoops with paint, ribbon, jewels, washi tape, etc. so there is all kinds of ways to be creative there.  I decided to just leave hers plain to not take away from the needlework and also she isn’t a ‘fussy’ child and I don’t know that she would like too much fluff.  So, that is what I have been doing.  Now it is time to start on the kits I bought in Williamsburg.  The fabric in the kit is a smaller count so I don’t know how crazy it will make me — we will see.So, yeah, that is what has been keeping me busy.  I was in a mad rush because of time constraints but the next project I won’t have that problem and I hope to sit down and actually enjoy the process a little more!"},
{"title": "Good Morning! It Feels Like Saturday", "date": "Wednesday, June 15, 2022", "text": "Good morning, friends!  It has been a busy couple of weeks.  My grandson is volunteering his time to a local piano competition and we are his transportation to the event.  So, since the first week of June we have been driving him to the venues.  It has been nice spending some one on one time with him and I think he has been enjoying himself even though his duties include carrying lots of boxes of programs and souvenir items. In addition to chauffeur duty, I have been doing lots of reading and needlework.  I just finished the last book in the Mitford series by Jan Karon.  I started these books years ago when they first came out — I received the first three in a box set for Christmas.  They were purchased from BookStop which tells you how long ago it was!  Last night I finished #14 — “To Be Where You Are”.  It took me awhile but I didn’t want to rush through, I wanted to enjoy it because it is rumored to be Karon’s final book in the series.  I loved how it ended — it closed NO doors and only opened up a way to future books.  Loved it!I have also been working on some needlework pics for Bean’s birthday.  She is very much into the Marvel movies — apparently a “thing” amongst her school chums.  So, I have purchased a gift but I discovered a magazine at Target all about Marvel and I have done a couple of little cross stitch pieces — one of baby Spider-Man and one of Thor and Loki.  The Thor and Loki is finished but not framed, the baby Spider Man is giving me grief because I really don’t like stitching in black but it is getting there.  Both are going to be simply framed in hoops with ribbon hangers because I don’t think this is going to be a permanent part of her decor. Actually, I am surprised she is still “into” it — I figured she would have lost interest long before I finished.  I will post photos when I am done framing.  Now, I have to find a new book to read.  I have bought a couple that are non-fiction — ‘Little White Houses —How the Postwar Home Constructed Race in America”.  I am interested in this book because I grew up in a neighborhood of those little white houses which were, literally, white, in a neighborhood that was geared to be white also.  Of course, at the time, I wasn’t aware of this, I just thought we lived in these little square houses, white asbestos shingles and various colored roofs and matching shutters.  But, apparently there was a deeper meaning and I am learning about that now.  It is rather dry reading though, I will say.  My daughter is reading a book for her certification course titled “The Hemminges  of Monticello”.  Also, non fiction but apparently very engaging.  It will arrive today and I will start of it.  Unfortunately I bought the physical book and not the kindle edition so I won’t be reading it in bed — it is a chunkster.  But, I am looking forward to it as well.  I had previously read another book about Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings and it was also very interesting.  The thing about this book that my daughter is reading is there is mention of several people bearing the surname “Cocke”.  I am a Cocke descendant and I believe the people in this book are cousins somewhere down the line which means it is going to take me down the genealogical rabbit hole once again.So, yes, that is what I have been up to.  It is hot as hades here in Texas and now we live in fear of our power grid going down.  I am beginning to believe that politicians want us to live in fear so they create all these fearful things to surround us with doubt and discomfort.  There was another shooting in our area but thankfully the only one that was injured was the shooter.  I certainly hope some changes are made soon.  This can’t go on.  Well, have a wonderful Wednesday! Stay cool and safe!"},

Because in those children’s faces I see the faces of my children, their friends as children, my grandchildren, their friends now and in those parents faces I see every parent’s worst nightmare realized.There are no words.  Wait, yes there are.  Fix it.  Fix it government — I don’t care if you are republican or democrat — fix it, children have no party affiliation.  Fix it communities — if you see something, say something, be vigilant, volunteer to sit outside the school and watch.  Do SOMETHING.  Fix it parents — don’t leave it up to others, fight for your children’s RIGHT TO LIFE.  We worry so much about abortion and the unborn, we worry about death panels for the elderly — when are we going to worry about the living children, the ones here and now, the ones that are the future of this world.We should be ashamed of ourselves — politics should not come first before human life.  I woke up yesterday morning to an announcement from the Girl Scout council that serves Uvalde.  One of the little girls was an active Girl Scout.  She was proud of the patches she earned, proud of her A-B honor roll certificate, she loved play-doh and I bet she loved her family and life in general.  She had a lot going for her, she had a future and it seemed like a bright one, she could have been a leader in her community and beyond — but instead……Tonight we have our bridging ceremony for our girls.  There will be a talk, a card and a donation.  Such pitiful little attempts to honor this little girl.  We should be honoring her life and achievements rather than her death.  Such a loss, such a stupid, senseless loss.When we are we going to get this right.  When are we going to get this fixed.  When.Pray for Uvalde."},
{"title": "There, I Did It Again —", "date": "Friday, May 20, 2022", "text": "Sounds like a song but yes, I did.  I fell again.  Tuesday morning. This time, instead of tripping over the dog I tripped over the vacuum cleaner that was not put away properly — my bad.  I don’t really know how it happened, I must have run my foot into the head which was sticking out in the doorway, and I could feel myself going.  I was trying to protect the arm I broke last year and in doing so I managed to fall on the vacuum, which was standing up, hitting my ribs and apparently I hit my hand on the wall.I was terrified.  I screamed for 10 minutes before my husband came in and noticed me.  I had to scoot out of the laundry room on my bum to get to a chair in the breakfast area so I could get up.  That is when I realized my foot was hurting really badly and I couldn’t stand on it.  Now, how my foot got involved I really don’t know — but it bore the brunt although my side is still hurting some — I think I pulled a muscle because I have no sore spots, no bruising - I didn’t even have a red mark right after it so i don’t think I broke anything but I do think I pulled a muscle.  My foot is another story.  It didn’t do anything all day — it didn’t get red, or bruise or show any signs of trauma until much later and a little knot came up on the top of my foot where my toes meet my foot.  Later it swelled some and bruised.  I iced it and kept it elevated only limping around when necessary.  By yesterday the bruising was gone and so was the swelling but it still hurts.  And here I sit under the ice pack again.  Ugh.So, what have I been doing when I am not on ice?  I have been stitching.  And reading.  Now I am exploring podcasts.  The concept is new to me and I am not finding a lot of interest but I am going to explore some more.Thursday nights are good TV nights for us.  We watch PBS a good deal and Thursdays gives us Midsomer and Poirot.  We have seen all the Poirots many times but they never get old.  So, Miss Trixie likes to go to bed at 9 p.m.  Well, that is all fine and good until there is something I want to watch on tv that interferes with her bedtime.  So, I was sitting in my new recliner stitching and she was standing on the floor barking at me to do SOMETHING!  It was clear she wanted to go to bed and I didn’t so I had to get out of my comfy recliner and sit on the sofa with her while I stitched and watched Poirot.  I took advantage of the moment to snap this photo —My stitching buddy!  I posted it on a FB cross stitch group and another lady posted a photo of HER stitching buddy and it could have been the same dog!  Hilarious.I keep forgetting I have a tv in the bedroom — we rarely use it and I guess I could go in there with the dog and continue watching but — well, I will have to think about that.We slept in this morning which is rare for us.  We didn’t get up until almost 8 a.m.  That never happens.  I think I was just so comfy that the thought of starting the day just didn’t hold much appeal.  Except, of course, to check the blink camera to see what went on on the deck last night.  Well, after several nights of virtually no activity, there was a block party going on in my back  yard!Fox #1 — I think FionaFox #2 — I believe FinneganThe cat — Oompa Loompa — that strolls though from time to timeNot sure what this is but I think it is the black and white cat that comes to visit once in a while.What concerns me is that they were all running.  From what?  Each other?  I don’t know but it gets really active out there sometimes.  I am surprised the scraggly possum didn’t show up — that is always fun because the foxes don’t seem to care if it is there or not.  Now, one night the fox and Oompa Loompa met up on the deck and had a bit of a showdown — oddly the cat won.  Who knew!  So, I don’t know, it is Friday night —- no telling what might happen — I just hope if there is beer they clean up their mess.I am still reading “To Be Where You Are” by Jan Karon.  I love her books so I am in no hurry to get done with it since this is the last in the Mitford series.  It will be like saying goodby to an old friend.  Well, I was going to bake some brownies but I have no mix so I am going to have to dig up the recipe from the cocoa can and go with that.  They are better anyway and not much trouble so I guess I should get busy as the oven has let me know it is heated.  More later — please pray I don’t fall anymore. Especially on my poor arthritic toes!"},
{"title": "Cozy Blog and How I Aroused the Sleeping Beast", "date": "Monday, May 16, 2022", "text": "I wish I knew how to make my blog cozier.  I read so many and they are so pretty with pretty backgrounds and such and pictures — so many pictures — but I just can’t seem to get my head around it.  I might have to spend some time working at it.  How I aroused the sleeping beast — the beast being my crafting mojo.  I have gotten back into stitching full force which is nice BUT I have been reading some of the stuff on one of my facebook groups about cardmaking and this morning I found myself slipping down the rabbit hole and at the bottom there was the sleeping beast of creativity and I accidentally poked it and woke it up.Now I have to shop because my glue is all dried up, my ink pads are all dried up and everything is in a shambles.  I need the Bean to come and help organize.  She is a pretty good organizer.  Anyway, I have awakened the beast and I want to make cards again.  And one member of the group recycles boxes, like popcorn boxes and cereal boxes to make gift boxes and that just looks like super fun and definitely a good way to save some recycling and some money!  I will have to try it.When I get some glue.  Amazon, here I come.We have been worried about Finnegan and Fiona lately as we haven’t seen them except in snatches.  We really can’t tell which is which except one has a black stripe down it’s tail.  We decided to move the camera to get a different angle because we really don’t know where they come from and we don’t know where they go — they just appear and then disappear. We were lucky last night though.  Before 9 p.m., when it was still light, the one I think is Finnegan came to visit — from where I don’t know — and he just decided to chill on the deck for a little while.  A little later the possum came too.  Scraggly thing it is but it keeps the nasties away so I am ok with it.  So for your viewing pleasure — Fox and FriendThe fox was nice to stop and pose for me but the possum is on the run and so it is very blurry but it is huge.  The fox is big too.  And apparently quite comfortable on my deck.  Oh well, as long as he doesn’t bother me I guess I don’t mind.So, what is up for today?  Well, clearly some Amazon shopping for glue, ink and whatever.  I have already made one purchase today that I need to pick up later but I don’t mind a pick up, I just don’t like in-store shopping anymore.  The pandemic has created a monster in me in that I like to just order and have somebody bring it to me!  Again, lazy cow. So, with that I am off to fluff some pillows and straighten some magazines, put some laundry in and go stitch.  And go upstairs and revisit the craft area and really take stock in what I have.  Yes, it will be fun!Oh, and tonight I will remember to get a photo of the candles in the lanterns.  This have been crazy around here the last week and I just plum forgot.  Maybe I need to make a list!"},
{"title": "The Week from — Well, You Know", "date": "Friday, May 13, 2022", "text": "Was it a bad week?  No, not really, just busy.  I am not an active person anymore and except for the occasional medical appointment and picking up the Bean, my time is pretty much my own.Until this week.Monday found me at the vet with Trixie.  A couple of months ago she had a UTI which we treated but alas, it doesn’t seem that the treatment worked so here we are on UTI —The Sequel.  More meds but these aren’t flavored so I am using pill pockets which she absolutely loves.  Hickory Smoked.  Best treats in the world.  Yep.Tuesday found us at the dentist on the other side of town which is about a 45 minute drive because we choose to travel the semi-sane back streets as opposed to the Highway from H—-.  This is DFW you know and the traffic is terrible.  So, we had our cleanings and I sat in the lobby ordering a cordless waterpik from Amazon.  My bathroom is weird and I have a very long vanity with my sink at one end and the electrical outlet at the other.  Very inconvenient so I opted for the cordless variety of waterpik.  I received it and will let you know how it works when I finally get it organized.  I know, I know.Then, that afternoon we found ourselves at our granddaughter’s school for a band concert.  It was good but I have no photos.  It was early evening which pretty much conflicted with our dinner which is bad because of my husband’s schedule for his diabetes.  But, we had a large lunch and he snacked quickly for dinner and off we wentWednesday and Thursday we attended our oldest and youngest granddaughter’s dance recitals.  They were supposed to be fairly short like mini recitals. Ha! We were there for three and a half hours each.  Again I have no photos, just video I took and my DIL doesn’t like their photos on the internet which I respect.  The first recital was my youngest, on Wednesday and she did a good job and the routines were cute.  The recital last night was my oldest granddaughter and she also did a good job.  The programs, however, were almost identical so it was like a re-run — it was tiring. Tonight I have Girl Scouts.  I am not going.  They are just going to have to Scout without me.  It will be fine.On Wednesday we went to the Tempurpedic store to buy me some new pillows because my shoulder has been hurting and I decided the culprit was my 8 year old pillows.  On our way out of the store a person was pushing one of those large plastic bins they use in retail to tote linens and pillows and things — about 6 ft. tall — well, the guy pushing didn’t see my husband holding the door open and my husband didn’t see him coming and there was a collision.  There were no injuries but he knocked my husband off his feet about a foot away and you could see the fear of litigation in his eyes.  I was yelling “watch out, watch out” yet nobody heard me or paid attention and whack!  He seems to be ok, not sure about the other guy.This week, with all the activity, has left me well off my routine of doing what little I do.  I am now re-washing the cup towels for the third time because I keep forgetting to put them in the dryer.  Lazy cow I am.  So, I guess I am off to stand over the washer so I don’t do it again.Have a great Friday!"},
{"title": "I Love Amazon", "date": "Monday, May 09, 2022", "text": "You know, once in a while a girl just has to have some retail therapy.  Yesterday was my day.  As you know I have been doing more cross stitch lately and I have been looking for devices, ideas, anything to make it easier to adapt my ever changing needs.  I have been reading blogs and watching youtube videos and learning a good deal.I had to trade out my q-snap for a regular hoop because the snap was just a bit bulky for my damaged left hand to wrangle.  So, I have been using a 8 inch hot pink plastic hoop.  Since I stitch two handed the hoop is generally propped up on my hand or the table or my chest and the lighter weight helps a lot.I have a large, floor stand Mighty Light that is a light and magnifier and it is magnificent.  However, I was looking for something a little smaller and more portable since I have yet to find the perfect stitching spot and I am moving all over the house to figure it out. So, I found this, also by Might Light.It works pretty well and, in addition to being able to clip it on to the hoop, it has a little detachable stand if I want to use it that way.I unwrapped it this morning to give it a go and it is definitely a help.Opps, you got a sneak peak of my current project.I have also been exploring the perfect set up for keeping a project together when I am not working on it.  I bought some project bags which are fine but not rigid and I am thinking I need something more substantial.  So, while looking at blogs I discovered a lady using a 12 X 12 document box for a project box and I thought that might work.  I had bought four of them a while back to store larger photos and family history documentation in and I have one that is not in use so I am going to give that a go today.  For years I have been using a knitting bag to keep the cs stuff together but it tends to get cluttered and I am hoping by using a dedicated box per project I can keep it in neater order and maybe save my dining room table from looking like a stitch a long in a shop! I have also been looking at different ways to store floss rather than on bobbins as well.  I saw a video about a lady using 4 X 6 photo boxes and just leaving the skeins intact and storing by number.  I will have to see about that— I have a LOT of thread on skeins.I think I mentioned earlier that I am also using my iPad as my chart — I take a photo or scan it and put it in Dropbox to keep a permanent copy and then import (export?) it into GoodNotes where I have the editing capability and can mark off my rows and make notes and such.  That is working really well so far.Enough about cross stitch.I also decided to purchase some battery operated candles for a pair of copper lanterns I have.  They work great and look so realistic in the lanterns.  They look rather un-real here but when they are turned on and in the lanterns they look really nice.  I will take a photo tonight when I turn them on and show you how they look in the intended setting.  I am thrilled that they are programmable to come/off at a certain time and they have a nice little remote to make all of it happen.  Isn’t it cute?Please ignore the generally unkempt appearance of my table — it has turned into a workbench if you will and I am trying to fix that.  Oh, and Trixie has to go to the vet today as I think we are having a reoccurrence of her previous UTI.  Ugh, if it isn’t one thing it’s another."},
{"title": "Chickens Don’t Belong on Refrigerators!", "date": "Saturday, May 07, 2022", "text": "Yesterday was a very strange day for me.  I was just plodding through my day when something triggered some anxiety from the past.  I am not sure but I was left in a weepy meltdown for some unknown reason.  No need to go into details here, just leave it at skeletons sometimes jump out of the closets and that is what happened.  It pretty much ruined the rest of my day and sent me running to my mother-substitute-cousin to cry on her shoulder.  Unfortunately, I think I probably ruined her evening as well.  I apologize JLSHall.Today, however, is another day.  I do feel like I have been dragged through the mud, partly because of the meltdown and partly because of my allergies, mostly the allergies.  I did decide, though, that I needed to get up and be productive.It is Saturday and we had no real plans — well, at least I didn’t — and it is sort of a quiet, lazy day.  Hubs is procrastinating about cutting the back yard and I am really just puttering around.  I watched some youtube videos which is my new favorite thing to do.  I watched one on Chatham, MA and it was so lovely and relaxing — I would love to go there and just sit and watch the water.  I digress.So, as I was watching this video and the lady was talking about going on visits to small towns and getting inspiration for her own home I started thinking about mine.  For the last couple of years I have been sort of sucked up into the “minimalist” movement.  I have never been a minimalist but I kept thinking that maybe getting rid of everything  would ease my troubled soul.  Well, it was never going to happen because my husband is NOT a minimalist and he is NOT one to just get rid of stuff Willy nilly.  But, as I watched this lady on the video it struck me (things have been striking me a LOT the last couple of days it seems) that I am in no way, shape or form a minimalist.  In my 50 years of married life we have never had any home that even slightly resembled Scandi or even mid-century modern.  We started out all Early American with all the kitschy stuff that went along with it and here we are, 50 years later with me still living with the EA and now a good deal of Mission style furniture and the reality is — I like it.  I like the decor.  I like the stuff sitting around.  I don’t really think my soul would be at all eased by a minimalist approach.  I think I would feel lost and probably quite guilty for ditching my stuff and I am very good at feeling guilty.That brings me back to this morning.  I do not have an open floor plan house — after my last house I have decided I like a closed plan or at least a semi closed plan better which is good because that is what my current house is.  I do have a “counter” so to speak above my kitchen sink that opens a visual to the living area.  I have stuff on it to try to hide the dish drainer which we can’t seem to live without. I decided to do some tidying up of this counter and what did I find?  Dirty chickens.Now, these chickens came to live in our house a number of years ago when I fell in love with them at a furniture store.  They have names — Big Roo, Henny, and Baby Chick Dumpling.  When we moved here, in order to keep them out of harms way, I put them on the refrigerator and didn’t move them until a couple of months ago when we bought a new refrigerator.  I sat them on the counter.  Today I discovered they were gunky, greasy, sticky little chickens.So, they got a bath.  I felt truly terrible that I had not taken very good care of my chickens.  Baby Chick Dumpling was not found of the spray soap, Henny was thrilled to finally get clean and I got a very admonishing look from Big Roo.  I did learn a lesson from this though.DON’T PUT YOUR CHICKENS ON THE REFRIGERATOR!!!!So, here are the clean chickens.Aren’t they shiny?I also decided to freshen up the fake corner of the counter.  This includes fake ivy, fake succulents, and a fake bird.  I mean, why not.The other end of the counter is full of family photos.  I could share those but part of my family prefers I not share photos.  A also made a small purchase from Amazon.  I have a couple of copper lanterns that I bought for emergency lighting, to hold candles.  I have never used them for that and want to put them on the fireplace hearth with led candles.  I am pretty sure you won’t even realize they aren’t real candles.  I opted to buy the battery operated ones that have timers and can be programmed.  I think it will be nice to have a little light by the fireplace but I am not great with real candles, especially on the hearth, because Trixie likes to get up there and sleep.  Or bury bones.  I don’t know — I am not a dog.  I have enough trouble with my own brain/thinking — much less trying to think like a dog.So, that has been my morning. It was more productive than I thought because I woke up feeling a big off — well, a lot off — and my joints were so bad I had to have Excedrin for breakfast.  I have been trying to do without it and have done ok for a couple of days but that wasn’t going to happen today.  I blame our very strange weather — it is even strange for Texas — and it does seem to really affect my joints.Maybe I will find another small project to work on.  I will share photos of the lanterns when the candles come tomorrow.  I am anxious to see how they work on the timers.  Who knew?"},
{"title": "Trixie Talks!", "date": "Friday, May 06, 2022", "text": "Well, that is taking it to the extreme but Trixie is learning to communicate, finally.  Or maybe I am just starting to listen to her.When we adopted (bought) Trixie we met the breeder at a Petsmart in a nearby town.  The breeder, who we shall refer to as Miz B, was very proud of her litters as she should be, they were lovely puppies, and she was very quick to tell us that the puppies had already been trained to puppy pads. Red flag — although I didn’t know it at the time.Apparently Yorkies are not particularly easy to train — to do anything — and housebreaking can be a problem.  So, being trained to pads is not necessarily a good thing as we have never been able to UN-train her.  She is particular though — she will tinkle outside unless it is raining, snowing, icing, heavy dew, etc., her poops are always inside on a particular pad in a particular space.  I have pads in my powder room off the garage and the laundry room. She is very good about using them unless they have been used once and then she won’t reuse them.  They have to be changed immediately.The one rule we have in this house for her is that she cannot go into the living room until she has done her business.  She understand that and the gate (we have lots of baby gates) won’t be opened until she “performs”.We trained her to ring bells that hang on the door to let us know she wants to go out and she does a great job of that.  Multiple times a day.  Now, that doesn’t mean she is going to do important business once she is out there — sometimes she just wants to check out the yard.  And chase the birds.Well, this morning the dew was heavy so when I took her out she decided that her tiny Yorkie feet weren’t going to touch the wet grass.  So, in we came and I reminded her, as I closed the gate, that no living room until she used the potty pad.  I went about my business, paying no attention to her and I sat down to have my breakfast and I am suddenly aware of the bell ringing and this little, low growl at my feet.  This is new, she doesn’t usually growl.Well, I went to check and she had used the pad and wanted in the living room.  I realized that the growling was her way of telling me she was allowed in the living room now!  Cheeky monkey she is.  I guess I need to listen better!As you can probably tell, I spend the majority of my day tending to Trixie— trying to deal with her going in and out, changing out potty pads, making sure she doesn’t over eat because she is a porky Yorkie and keeping up with her required playtime.  Being a Yorkie mom is a full time job.  I keep thinking about getting her a sister or brother.I must be out of my mind."},

Don’t strain to look for Trixie, she isn’t there.  What has gone wrong you might ask?  Well, I DID say do a summer cut and they did do that but they also removed all her fluff off her legs — I guess that is what a summer cut is.  And, I asked them to shave her ears so they would stand up like a proper yorkie but they went back to the “bob” thing.  I guess I will have to cut them myself. She seemed fine after her spa day — she is usually crashing for the rest of the day when I get her home.  But, she seemed very perky and had the zoomies immediately when we got in the house. Well, at least she won’t need another spa day for a while — this place has gone up considerably and, well, they didn’t shave her ears and they did a good number of her legs so, we will see.  Might have to test out Petco but Trixie does like the people here and she doesn’t fight to go so, oh, I don’t know, it is only hair.  It will grow back.When I went out first thing this morning, there was a very small, very red cardinal on the grass, hopping around, doing birdie zoomies I guess.  I didn’t have the phone with me so no pics but it was so lovely and bright.  We have had cardinal families in those photinia bushes every years, several families, so I guess this was a baby from this years flock.  It flew back up into one of the bushes so I guess that is where their nest is.  I will try to catch a glimpse of it again — with my camera!  I know they say that when you see a cardinal it is a visit from a loved one.  Well, in my yard, it is like they are having a family reunion — every year! My next door neighbor’s yard has been declared a refuge for songbirds by the National Audubon Society so we have lots and lots of birds around here but in my yard, mostly cardinals.  I love them.  My yard is just a yard, not a lot of garden area and not much color so they certainly do add color to the area!"},
{"title": "A New Start", "date": "Wednesday, May 04, 2022", "text": "As I have mentioned before, when I travel I have certain souvenirs I like to buy.  I try to find a cute Christmas ornament, a book about the area and a cross stitch project.  A couple of years ago when we went to New Orleans I bought two cross stitch projects — the St. Louis Cathedral that I finished recently and a Mardi Gras mask.  They had a mask pattern honoring my husbands university but, unfortunately, they were out of the pattern so I opted for another instead.That mask pattern is my new start — trying to play catch up before I start the two I have just purchased in Williamsburg.Hard to tell from the photo but this is done is lovely shades of purple, blue, chartreuse and gold.  The threads they recommend are speciality threads and lots of metallics and I don’t enjoy working with those so I am going to use just regular DMC threads that I chose the colors.It won’t be as flashy as the recommended threads but I don’t want it to be too frustrating either and those speciality threads can pose issues if not done correctly.  I am jumping back into cross stitch as a way to relax and, ahem, get off the computer (FB) so much so I don’t need it to be an ordeal.  Hopefully as time goes on I will want to work with the fancy things but not so much right now.I am using just plain white Aida 14 because that is what I can see the easiest. I can’t show you a photo of the pattern due to copyright issues but I will say that I took the time this weekend to learn to download the pattern into Dropbox/GoodNotes and I intend to stitch this one from my iPad rather than juggling a paper pattern, a magnet board, highlighters, etc.  I am looking for a way to reduce the stitching “clutter” if you will so I can more easily stitch in front of the tv — I am so lazy.I figured I would try this new approach on this small pattern first.  Once in GoodNotes you can use their art/writing tools to mark the digital pattern as you go and that way you keep your original copy pristine.  Now, this all sounds wonderful in theory and I have read many group chats and blogs that swear by it — I will let you know as I carry on.  Actually, if it works as it should, I think it will be marvelous for small projects — not real sure about these multi page projects but I am taking it one step at a time.In reading news I am still working on the Jan Karon book and it is keeping me busy — I have always really enjoyed her books.  My cousin is reading a spooky title right now — can’t remember the name — and it looks really good but I read in bed before I go to sleep so not sure it is a good choice but I might give it a go for a daytime/car read.Today is Trixie’s spa day — I try to take her once a month because she gets to be a matted mess if she isn’t kept short haired.  The last time they didn’t trim her ears enough and now they are tangled so we are going to have to have a chat about that.  I managed to overbook the afternoon and have about a 30 minute window of time to get the Bean from school, get the dog from the groomer, get the Bean to an afternoon activity and get home to cook.  One of those things might not happen.  Can you guess which one?  So, since I am going to have to take Bean a snack on our little fast-paced adventure this afternoon and I am out of store bought cookies I am off to bake a pan of brownies.  Yes, a boxed mix which I don’t like as well as my homemade ones using the recipe off the cocoa can but, as you can see, I am a bit time challenged today — something happens to me when I don’t turn on the tv first thing in the morning — it is like time stops for me — that is usually a good thing but not always.Have a wonderful Wednesday, stay safe and well and come back to visit soon."},

So, I will be correcting that after it is dry.I washed it in a lingerie bag with Woolite trying to create the most gentle, safest environment to do this step.  It turned out great and, as soon as I correct the two stitches, I will iron it and plan on a finish.I have ordered some mounting supplies — some acid free archival tapes and I have a large sheet of 3/8 inch foam core to do my mounting on.  I am not going to use batting because I am looking to put it behind glass with a mat.  It will probably go in an 8 X 10 frame with a mat.  I would go seek out a frame today but Hubs cut the grass with the copious amount of dandelions and his allergies are alive and well so I am not going to suggest going looking for frames.  So, here are the photos—The finished piece after washing — I was very pleased to see that the gridding came out beautifully.  I have hung it to dry so I will see if any of the marks reappear.  I hope it doesn’t because I really did enjoy the process and the fact that it made following the pattern so much easier.The finished piece before washing.  So, I guess the next thing is to climb the stair and look at the next project.  I think it is going to be the Mardi Gras mask!"},

If it unravels, I will just do it again! But, I have washed projects like that before and it has worked fine.I have been giving some thought to the next project — I have so many and I am finding even more on blogs and Etsy.  I need to quit looking.  I think I will probably do the Mardi Gras mask - it looks like fun and it has some sparkly trim to add to it.  I am a little worried about Trixie.  She is under the weather.  She didn’t eat last night and she hasn’t eaten all day.  She is just laying. Last month she had a rather bad UTI and she seemed fine after her course of antibiotics — I hope it hasn’t come back on her.  If she isn’t better tomorrow I guess we will visit the good doctor Jennifer on Monday.  We need to get her well because she really needs a visit to the groomer.  I will see if she perks up when the Hubs grills this meat we are having for dinner — it will let me know how she REALLY feels.Tonight I have to get ready for church and it is Father Brown night!  I love weekends on our PBS channel. I am reading the 14th book in the Mitford Series by Jan Karon.  It is the most recent (published about 5 years ago) and I think probably the last in the series.  I bought it the minute it came out and I am just now getting around to reading it but, like all the others, it has drawn me in and I am having trouble putting it down.  I definitely recommend the series.Well, that is about it for this cloudy, breezy Saturday.  Have a wonderful rest of your weekend and hopefully my next post will feature a finished project."},
{"title": "Hobby Lobby —- I Caved and Went — Glad I did but….", "date": "Monday, April 25, 2022", "text": "I have a love/hate relationship with Hobby Lobby.  I don’t like their politics.  But, they are the only craft store in town with any stock.  And they have a LOT of stock.  Which is another reason that I don’t like to go there.  They have it — all of it — and I want it — all of it — now.  And I could have it, theoretically except I took my husband so that sort of negates the having it all.  Who am I kidding, I couldn’t have it all — that place has so much to buy I would have to sell my firstborn, mortgage the house, rent out my husband and I still couldn’t get it all.So, right inside the door sitting on a piece of barn wood/wrought iron furniture was a gnome cookie jar.  It was all spring like, in a bee sort of motif with a yellow and black striped hat (and bees are my “thing”) and a slight, delicate little “ooooohhhh” escaped from my mouth about the same time a “hmmmmm…..what would you do with it” escaped from my husbands.  So, I put it down, grabbed a basket and went on with the task at hand.The task at hand was to acquire some much needed (debatable) cross stitch supplies.  My interest in the craft has been renewed so I decided I needed to purchase a few things — much more justifiable than the gnome cookie jar — especially since I am SUPPOSED to be getting rid of the cookies.  I digress.So, anyway, here is my haul..Yes, not cross stitch but I like to embroider kitchen towels too and — well — bees!Mounting canvasMore mounting canvasApparently I plan on mounting a lot of stuff to these canvasses.I didn’t show the fake geraniums I bought but that will be another post—my ten minutes of gardening on the front porch!So, I went up stairs to sort through my cross stitch stuff and I reduced the patterns and kits to thisTwo carts worth of charts and half-finished kits.  This does not include the 4” binder I have filled with patterns removed from magazines but I couldn’t show you that because, well, I have lost it.  How I lost a notebook heavy enough to be a small child is beyond me but I have a tendency to store things of import in notebooks in page protectors — I have several — and now I have lost this one.  I am sure it will turn up somewhere.  If not, it appears I have enough to keep me busy until whenever.  I am sure I will lose my mojo again at some point.As I posted earlier, I finished my New Orleans piece and have started on my Ukrainian mitten pattern.Somewhere in the middle of doing the New Orleans picture I decided that, due to the difficulty, I should have tried my hand at gridding.  Of course, it was too late for that piece but I promised myself I would do it for the next piece.  I have been wanting to start on the mitten pattern because it is really cute and I want to use it as my fb profile photo for awhile.  I figured it would go fast because it is not large so I thought it would be a good opportunity to try gridding.I have some lovely hot pink sulky sliver thread to use for gridding but I decided to just go with the water soluble pen for this first attempt.  My next attempt I might go with the sulky sliver.  It depends.  On what you might ask?  If the stuff washes out!  I have made considerable progress on this little mitten and if I forego the vacuuming and just sit down and stitch I will have it done today but, no, I must vacuum first then I can stitch with a clear conscience.  Whatever — we all know that decision could go either way.So, that is what is going on on the cross stitch front.  In books I am still reading “The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek”.  I am making better progress since I put it on my kindle.  My hands just won’t let me hold books, even paperbacks, for very long at all, the kindle is better.  And, my new bed is on an adjustable frame which props me up at the perfect reading angle which makes it all so much better.  I am like in a little reading cloud!  Ok, enough of that silliness.Does anybody watch “Call the Midwife”?  Love it! Makes Sunday nights as an adult almost as great as Sunday nights with the Wonderful World of Disney! Opps, there I got, dating myself again.  Ha!Have a wonderful Monday — off to vacuum!"},
{"title": "Ugh — One Step Forward and Two Steps Back", "date": "Friday, April 22, 2022", "text": "Today I am starting intermittent fasting — again.  I did it for four months and it was great — I didn’t eat sugar AT ALL and I didn’t eat between meals and I didn’t lose weight but I felt good.  I also did it one day at a time and didn’t look at the big picture — my big picture was THAT particular day.I don’t know what happened — or how it happened — but a cookie jumped into my mouth and down the rabbit hole I went.  I am working to start over and today is the day.  I am doing the 12:12 fasting plan which is recommended (by some unknown person/book) for a female my age.  It is pretty easy to do because I am asleep most of the time.  My eating window starts at 7 a.m. and ends at 7 p.m.  I am usually finished eating by 6 though because of our dinner schedule for my husband’s diabetes.  I am also going to try to do more whole foods and less processed, more salads and less starches.  We eat out a lot and it really shouldn’t be a problem because you can get salads anywhere.  Maybe add a little salmon.  Yep, I can do that.So, I have started out well and taking it one day at a time.  My goal is twofold — weight loss and less inflammation.  Wish me luck. Hopefully my joints will thank me.My journaling has gone belly up — however, I will start it again today.  It might be useful with the fasting.  Ok, enough of that.  I was so taken with Williamsburg that I have been watching youtube videos of it — they are great—and I want to go back.  However, I have also had a yearning to go back to San Antonio.  It came to me this morning that it has been four years since I have been home.  I get homesick once in a while — less now that I have been gone for so long — but still, I think we need to make the perilous drive down I-35 before summer is out.We have been worried about our fox family the last few days.  When I posted the pic of the babies playing in the ornamental grass that was the last of them for several days.  We even put out water because it has been pretty warm here — already 91 yesterday — but no foxes.  Well, my phone pinged early this morning and lo and behold here it isI wish he/she/they would come out during the day so I could capture the color.  With that said, our foxes are gray foxes and they don’t have that glorious red hue to their fur.  But, they are ours and we love them.  However, I wish they would come home, they are spending way too much time someplace else and I want to get a good look at the babies.   I keep wanting to leave out a dog biscuit or two but I get a resounding no from the hubs. So.,  Hmmmp.Well, it is time to revisit the washing machine.  Such fun on a Friday.  And then I am going upstairs to revisit all the cross stitch stuff and I will take photos of the damage I did at Hobby Lobby yesterday.Have a great Friday!"},
{"title": "Pet Peeves", "date": "Tuesday, April 19, 2022", "text": "I am a blessed person.  I have always been a blessed person.  I have a roof over my head, food in my belly, a beautiful family, a wonderful supportive place of worship, I am on top of the dirt and I really have very few worries.I am blessed.  I have no reason to complain.  However, it has come to my attention that there are things that annoy me.  I should overlook them.  I really should.  However, some of them are rather impactful.  Is that a word?  The one that comes to mind is — ready? — low toilets.  These can be found mostly in public restrooms.  How do I deal?  Well, after almost killing myself trying to use one of these really oddly low toilets, I learned to use the handicapped stall regardless.  Of course, now I am sort of handicapped so it is appropriate but before I could have been handicapped had I fallen and broken my back trying to use the oddly low toilet.  Why don’t designers think things through?  Who does that?Shopping has become an annoyance.  Why you might ask?  Well, let’s blame it on the pandemic.  That is an easy scapegoat but it is the truth.  We have been ordering online for two years now.  I didn’t really have a problem with it at all because, being slightly handicapped, I don’t really enjoy meandering through large stores.  I like to get what I need, I know what I like, and then leave.  Ok, so it isn’t all the pandemic or my rotten knees, I am not comfortable being in large, enclosed places anymore where somebody could wake up of a morning and think it a good idea to go shoot up all the little old ladies in the Allison Daily section of Dillards.  I am just not a fan of enclosed space.  Or open spaces for that matter where people congregate. I digress.  Over the weekend I did a good clean out of my cross stitch/embroidery supplies.  I have learned over the years that my fabric of choice is Aida 14, not even weave and definitely not linen.  As I went through my stash I realized I had no more Aida 14.  I also wanted some mounting boards and some 1/4 inch appliqué pins.  So, my husband was going to Home Depot which is conveniently located right next to Michaels.  I decided to go in and replenish my stash.  Well, hold on, cowgirl — not so fast.  Easier said that done.  They had nothing.  No pins, no Aida 14 in the brand I wanted, no mounting boards — and their little artificial flowers were ridiculously priced so……I came home empty handed ready to let my fingers do the walking and do my shopping online.So what am I annoyed about?  The fact that every time I go into a store to buy something they don’t have it — the stores look like they are going out of business.  It is ridiculous.  However, our Target seems fully stocked and we are getting an Ulta in the store — that warms my heart because I can binge shop cookies and cosmetics all in the same store — actually, in the same area of the store!  Be still my heart.So, I guess at the end of the day I don’t have many grievances.  I really don’t have much to complain about.  I am blessed."},

The colors are lovely but I have learned a lot from this little chart.One — if your pattern is mostly beige tones — DON’T use oatmeal fabric.  Two — look at the pattern before you ever buy it — if you can — to make sure it isn’t impossible to read.Three — give yourself the grace to wing it need be.So, it is done.  I am not sure how to finish it — sort of into framing in hoops these days — but I will see — I thought I was going to give up on it but glad I didn’t.I will revisit when it is framed."},

In this case, it was sea shells as massive amounts of shells were used to fill in areas of landscaping.It was a wonderful trip — the drive was horrible and long but it was worth it.I had a physical reaction when I saw this building.  Can’t explain it, looking into it.Enlarge this photo — there is a surprise in there!Without sounding like some sort of a lunatic, I felt quite the connection to this place.  We went to an organ recital at Bruton Parish church and I later discovered that a person named Dr. William Cocke is buried in that church — and he died in that church.  I am related to a Willliam Cocke.  My William Cocke isn’t Dr. William Cocke but I am absolutely positive there is a familial connection and I will find it but again — so many Williams in the family.  It will take some time but I will find it.  The organ recital was wonderful, by the way, Irish music on St. Patrick’s Day.  If you have never been to Williamsburg I would suggest a visit — I will be going back — with a better walker!"},

{"title": "Working Trough Things", "date": "Thursday, February 24, 2022", "text": "At 72 years old one would think I had nothing left to work through.One would be wrong.Some days I feel 12 going through puberty hell.  I blame it on the cessation of long term medications which controlled my hormones.  I feel a little lost, in a way, because at 72 I am still trying to figure out who I am!  How ridiculous!I find myself spending copious numbers of hours researching how I am supposed to be.  For some reason I feel the need to be validated by some random talking head on the internet.  I want somebody to tell me what to wear, what kind of make up to wear, what to read — it is really annoying.  I have a style both in my personal styling and in my home — I know what I am comfortable with but yet, I want SOMEBODY to tell me it is correct — the right way for me to be.  WTH is this? I would like to go back and blame somebody for this indecisive nature of myself, this lack of confidence in who I am and what I do but I have nobody to blame.  I don’t have a great self-esteem and I think, in that regard, I can look back at my relationship with my mother and find elements that could probably have contributed to that.  My mother was not a bad person and she was a wonderful mother and she adored me but her method of discipline was to express “disappointment” in me — the worst thing I could do in life was to disappoint her — I can’t believe that was the worst thing I could ever do but that I what I was told. And then, there was the time in the  6th grade when I was deemed inacceptable by my peers parents and their children told not to associate with me.  No fault of my own, they didn’t like my father, but I knew about this event and it stuck with me.  So, yeah, maybe I can blame them.  And I do.But, that was eons ago — and here I am, trying to figure ME out — what is right for me and what to do about it.  And how to do it without somebody else to tell me it is ok, that  I am ok.  I think probably the description of this is self acceptance and self awareness.So……..I bought a journal.  Haha! Yes, a journal — a dotted Moleskin hard backed journal in classic black.  I am going to use it to try to figure me out — mostly with ideas, goals, doodles, food, anything I can think of that is a challenge that makes me question myself.  I want to be me.  I don’t want to be what somebody wants me to be.  I don’t want to have to scour the internet to find out how I am supposed to be and what I am supposed to think or how I am supposed to look.  I think I have just lost sight of me.  Again, self acceptance.  I have spent so many years trying to be acceptable (thanks grown up mothers of my childhood peers).  I want to be enough — for me.  I need to accept me at this age and — as I told my girl — be true to myself.  Why do I think somebody else knows what is best for me?  So, I have been reading that journaling is very theraputic.  I want to draw — no talent but loads of desire — so maybe some doodling will go on.  I need to break the comfort food cycle (ok, I can blame my mother for that!) so journaling food is probably going to be part of it — I just need to break the internet scrolling cycle.  Maybe the blue light is getting to my brain.So, anyway, sorry for the slight rant here - and bringing up things that I don’t ever really choose to talk about — and hopefully the journal will get here soon.  I would have gone out to buy one but you know — ice.  Ugh.  Have I mentioned I hate winter.  Hate is a strong word — winter is a strong season."},

I am not keen to splash the interior of my home on social media but I thought I would share here. Don’t worry, it isn’t going to take your breath away. But, for what it is worth, here is my mantle—I will say that this fireplace was a selling point in this house and I really do like it.  The clock was a Christmas gift from my mother in law many years ago.  The snow globe was a gift to my husband from our daughter and the rest of the stuff came from Pier 1. The two candle holders on the hearth don’t belong there and will be going back to their proper places today. The little red bird came from the gift shop at the Tyler Rose Museum in Tyler, Tx.  For some reason I gravitate toward birds.So, while the bungalow group isn’t going to see my mantle, I hope you like it.  The fireplace hasn’t been used once this year.

I was depressed.  I asked a friend if she did the same when she quit taking it and yes, indeed, she did.  Well, alrighty.Then earlier in the week, my daughters father in law passed away.  It wasn’t expected but yet he had been ill  for months.  The day I called our rector to let him know my daughter would be traveling to England soon he confided in me that he would be retiring at the end of this year. Cue the tears. I have been in lots of churches and known lots of pastors but I have never known one like Fr. K.  He has been at our church 23 years and for all that time he has been a part of our family’s good times, bad times, milestones,  celebrations — he is family. He isn’t leaving the area, wants to still be active in the diocese, and says he will maintain the friendships he has nurtured and built over the years.  I am going to hold him to that.  I am heartbroken.Like I said, this has been a bad week.  And now we are having snow and ice.  No words."},

I would donate but they won’t take open food.  Then, as I was putting things away after grocery shopping I found several cans that were outdated so I dealt with those.  Now my medicine box needs to be pared down and re-arranged and possibly even moved somewhere else.The one thing I struggle with are the cutlery packets that come with takeout food.  We generally don’t use them but since I feel that we DO pay for them I hate to get rid of them.  I mean, they do come in handy to stick in a bagged lunch or to use for wet dog food. BUT, they have gotten all over the pantry so I need to find a better way to corral those.  It looks like today is going to be a “mental” work day more than a physical work day trying to figure out how to rearrange things.However, it will all come after church which I will be doing virtually.  I have been exposed to the plague and since our church is largely made up of older people I really don’t want to drag my germs around to maybe share.  I am giving myself two weeks to let this pass and then will be back.It is a lovely day here but very, very cold.  As you probably saw on some newscast or the other we had an unfortunate hostage situation in a synagogue in a neighboring community.  I have been to that synagogue for a bar mitzvah several years ago — a lovely place in a wooded area — rather small.  Such a shame those people had to go through that — what are we coming to as a society.  Fortunately the people that were being held were all freed and unharmed.  The hostage taker didn’t fare as well but I guess it is to be expected.  When the big SWAT trucks arrive you know it isn’t going to be a fair fight.  I am just so thankful the people were saved and nobody was harmed.  “They” keep saying the omicron variant is peaking and should be on the downswing soon.  I am not holding my breath but hopefully “they” are right.  I wouldn’t be surprised if there was another variant waiting in the wings.  I think I might have to buy one of the fancy KN95 masks.  What a mess.  It is a good thing I am an introvert and like to stay home.  I have even learned to love shopping online.  Because my green thumb is non-existent I even ordered a faux pothos ivy yesterday.  It will be here today sometime before 10 pm.  Isn’t “faux” a nice word?  Sounds so much better than “fake”.  But either well, it will definitely survive better than “real” in my house!  I have other “faux” plants round and I think they are ok.  I will post a photo of all of them when it comes.  I even have a “faux” succulent - bet you thought you couldn’t kill succulents — well, you can and I did!I finished my fourth book of my Goodreads challenge.  It was #10 of the Garden Girls mystery series — “Home for the Holidays”.  It was good — they have all been good.  I recommend.  I have been reading on my Kindle because it is easy to read in bed with it but I might look at some of my physical books and see what to read next.  I really prefer the e-reader though — so I don’t know.  I will let you know what is next in my queue.I am setting up a better cross stitch area.  That is one of the organizational items I am working on today.  I could go upstairs and stitch but I sort of like it down here.  I don’t know, I will see.  I do have a tv upstairs and all MY toys so that might be what I need to do.  Maybe I need to try it.  On that note I am going to get ready for church and then make my “plan” for the day — since my mouth is still tender and slightly painful I am not going to do too much but maybe I will get something accomplished.Have a wonderful Sunday!"},

I know that sounds ridiculous, you would think at my age my routines would be set in stone, but something happens when your husband retires — suddenly everything just goes out the window!  We now seem to be in some sort of competition.  My new routine is a bit Flylady-seque .  I start by getting dressed, making the bed, emptying the dishwasher, putting on a load of laundry,  blah blah blah.  Well, he has been watching me and is questioning how I am doing the laundry.  He thinks I am not being efficient.  Well, I think doing the laundry on a daily basis and keeping things from piling up is pretty bloody efficient!  Plus energy saving — MY energy.  Then,  yesterday morning I heard him in the kitchen rattling around and he was unloading the dishwasher BEFORE me!  I sort of chuckled because I didn’t know we were having a contest.  It seems like we are two school children and somehow competing for something but I am not sure what.  However, in the photo below I declared him the winner of that particular round.I think he needs to go back to work.  Or out to his workshop and do something workshop-y.  Or rebuild his computer — something, anything — and quite rearranging my pantry — he is left handed and puts everything on the wrong side and I can’t find anything!  Who knew getting old was going to be so amusing?So,  yes, off to find the tea bags for another cuppa.  Have a wonderful Saturday!"},
{"title": "The Mighty Oak", "date": "Tuesday, January 04, 2022", "text": "When we purchased our current home, one of the selling features other than the massive garage, was a huge, probably ancient oak tree.  It is a gorgeous tree.  In the summer it shades a good deal of the yard.  In the autumn, when all the leaves have fallen it lends just the right spookiness to the season as you can see the purple sky through it’s gnarly branches at dusk.  In the winter, if we have snow, it looks like a Christmas card.The tree spoke to my husband, being the Texan he is,  it represents our heritage, the strength, the longevity, the beauty.  Oaks are quite revered here in Texas.  To me, it brings out my Celtic heritage and I look at it and see all the spirituality and tradition surrounding it — the mighty oak.BUT…..then there is the other not-so-romantic side to it.  What side is that you might ask?The leaves.These suckers don’t wither and dry up and crumble, drifting deep into sod and the dirt to fertilize and feed the grass to allow for the new spring growth.  Nope.They just sit there.  And pile up.  And get moldy.Enter Trixie.  She hates the leaves.  Why you might ask?  Because she is a fuzzy dog.  And they stick to her.  She tries to piddle and the leaves are all stuck to her underside.  She tries to run and the the leaves, some that are still attached to little branches, trip her up — she has very short legs you know.  And then, when it is time to come in, she looked like she has been tarred and feathered like a character out of the old children’s story, Brer Rabbit.So, what does she do?  She runs like a devil monkey all over the house throwing the leaves all over.  Literally, all over.The vacuum cleaner won’t pick them up so I have to sweep them up — such a delight for my sore back — but that is ok because I can get up the kibble that she has thrown all over trying to separate her pate food from her kibble food (yes, I mix it hoping she will eat enough of either or both to sustain life.  How is this dog so porky?).

{"title": "January 1, 2022", "date": "Saturday, January 01, 2022", "text": "Happy First Day of 2022!.  Today has been just as I planned — a quiet, laid back sort of day that I could begin my new routine.  I have been doing a lot of thinking over the last couple of weeks and decided to make some changes in my routine.  I know it sounds silly to think that changing the time of day you do things could make a difference but it truly does.The first thing I have done is change up the time of the day I do all my self care.  I am finding that I am too bushed at night to indulge in too much primping so I have decided to do it early in the morning.  Go to bed with makeup on, you say?  No, I just simply don’t wear makeup if I am home so I don’t have to take it all off which I really don’t like doing.  I did get some lovely microfiber facial clothes that remove makeup with just water and, of course, I make good use of my Bioderma micellar water.  See, while I love the idea of self indulgence I am just too lazy. I have learned that if I shower at night it wakes me up — wide awake — but, a warm shower in the morning and all the potions and lotions just make the day start out good.  It also feels sort of good to put myself first in the day instead of last.I have also made an attempt to conquer laundry and I think I have won that battle.  I worked like a Trojan to get all the laundry done a few days ago — nothing hiding anywhere — all done.  So now, when I get up in the morning I grab up what we have dirtied the day before and wash it, dry it, fold it and viola! Done!  Two loads at the most.  I am lucky to have a very flexible washer with very small load levels so I don’t feel like I am draining the ocean or anything.  I have also been using a soap called “Clean People”.  It is detergent infused papers that dissolve when wet so you put your clothes in the machine, you lay one on top and fill the washer and again — done.  I ran out of these little papers so I bought a bag of Charlies soap and I am sorry to say I ruined a t-shirt with it.  It appears that I put the soap on top of the clothes and it sat and didn’t wash off and basically it looked like I had spilled bleach on the shirt.  I washed it again but to no avail — the shirt was ruined.  So, I am going back to the Clean People papers.Another new habit I am trying to form is unloading the dishwasher immediately upon entering the kitchen in the morning.  I get up, take the dog out, bring the dog in, take the dog out, bring the dog in and then after I feed her and make her happy I wash blueberries for breakfast.  We eat oatmeal and blueberries every.single.morning. So, my job is to wash the blueberries.  Then I  usually go in and hop on my ipad or my Nintendo switch but  for the last couple of weeks, I have been taking the five or so minutes it takes to unload the dishwasher.  It is just us two so there are never a lot of dishes because that would only happen if I cooked and again …. Lazy.  So I unload the DW and by the time I am done, Hubs has completed the oatmeal — real team effort here — we eat and load the DW back up again.  They say you can’t teach old dogs new tricks and yet, here I am at 71, learning that life is easier if you clean as you go.  Who knew!Oh, and another thing I am disciplining myself to do and you are going to be shaking your head wondering how I got as old as I have without making this a habit. Well, I don’t know.  I guess it was just never a priority for me.  It was for my mother but not for me — however — I am now making my bed every morning.  The dog just has to wait for her in/out/in/out ritual.  Then, after doing all these little chores that hang over me but really take no time at all I can enjoy some time with the fun stuff.  My mother raised me to believe I could only “play” once all the chores are done.  Well, that worked when SHE was doing all the chores but it doesn’t work for me because I am the one doing the chores.  If I wait until everything is done I would never do anything.  But, I am also trying to plan my time to be able to do all of it — maybe not all at one time, but all of it a little at a time.I mean, I might not be able to cross stitch for hours but I can for a half hour, same for reading.  Slow and steady wins the race.  Oh my gosh— how old and cliche!My daughter has decided to read the Bible this year.  I decided to read along with her.  I am a believer and a church goer but I have never been a good Bible reader.  So I am using a women’s devotional Bible — ESV version — that is a guided study.  I have two copies of the same thing, different version, but I realized that the print was sort of a light gray and these old eyes were straining so I put a new version on my Kindle and that is what I intend to use.  So, while I don’t make resolutions, I am trying to do some things to streamline my life — and I will say it has been a lot easier since I have been off the medicine which just totally sapped my energy and left me with no desire to do anything.  I am getting a big kick seeing how quickly and efficiently I can get things done early in the day so I have time for the fun stuff later.  I mean, honestly, there were days when making the bed was a day long endevour when, in reality, it takes five minutes.  I didn’t realize how much strength and energy I had lost but it is coming back in spades and I am taking advantage of it for sure.So, that is how my new year is starting out.  I hope you have had a wonderful day and are looking at the new year with anticipation."},

And a New Start or Perhaps an Old Finish — I Am So Confused!", "date": "Sunday, December 26, 2021", "text": "Happy Boxing Day!  When I was growing up Christmas Day marked the end of the Season.  I realize that a lot of people follow the liturgical calendar and it is actually the beginning of the Christmas Season.  Regardless of wherever you sit on that particular fence, I hope it is good for you!For me, I am still enjoying our Christmas Village that we put up every year.  I didn’t put up a Christmas tree this year because, I was tired.  My mojo was AWOL.  I just couldn’t do it.  Did I miss it?  Not in the beginning but yesterday I was really wishing I had put it up and I almost did but thought better of it.  I am happy to report that I feel my energy returning after cessation of the meds I have been taking. I am seeing that my interest in things is returning and mentally I seem to be more clear — I can actually string words together in a sentence that makes sense rather than stumbling over my words and forgetting what I am saying mid-sentence.So I am looking forward to the new year and a new me — I really do feel like a new me — and I am looking forward to getting back to some of my previous interests.  I feel like I have lost so much time being in a medicated fog for so long.  But, not to dwell on that, I am better now and moving on to the New Year with great anticipation.One of the things I am looking forward to is getting back to my cross stitching.  Embroidery has been a part of my life since I was a child and cross stitch since I was a young adult.  It is one thing that I can do to relax because I have no expectations — I collect all the “stuff”  and the patterns with no idea if I will ever do it all but it is small and doesn’t take up much room.  I can put it down and pick it up and it is relaxing — no, I don’t stitch on linen — that is not relaxing to me.  14 or 18 ct. Aida is my fabric of choice.  To me it is my “art” right up there with card making which is another post.  So, anyway, I have been away from cross stitch for quite awhile.  I was working on a piece when I broke my arm last year — or was it year before last — I forget.  Clearly I couldn’t hold a hoop or q-snap so into the drawer it went.   I now want to finish the piece and do a few others that I have been having in my queue for a long time.  So, I asked for some new supplies for Christmas.I lose scissors at an alarming frequency so I bought some more.  A spare is never a bad thing.Needles.  Lots of needles.  I was trying to get all my stuff ready to work on the current piece and I couldn’t find a needle to save my life so I ordered a years supply.I have never had a needle minder before so I bought one.  A fox motif, of course, to honor Finnegan and Fiona.And this thing — it is actually a tablet holder but it has a neat pocket that my Lo-Ran metal magnet board will slip right into. It also has little pocket to hold the scissors and a package of needles.I am currently using a knitting thing to hold all my cross stitch stuff but it is large and awkward so I am trying to condense so I ordered some project bags.  I really only wanted one but they came in sets of five so here we are.  I am hoping they help me control my messinessAnd, as a surprise my husband ordered me this little needle threader from Lee Valley tools.  I love Lee Valley tools.  I have lots of gadgets and stuff from there that are actually useful and affordable.So, here is the current project.  It is actually almost done and I am going to spend some time today seeing how far I can get with it.  I haven’t held a hoop or a q-snap (my favorite) in a long time and my left wrist is weak and painful at times so it might take me longer but I am determined to not have to give up this hobby.I am now going to have to rearrange my threads because it seems that some little Porky Yorkie with an attitude got into my threads and chewed up several bobbins, including the thread numbers, so I might have to make a trip to Michaels as DMC #452 is missing or I don’t recognize it because it is one of the half eaten bobbins.  I will work it out.Hopefully the next post will show some progress.  We will see."},
{"title": "Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!", "date": "Friday, December 24, 2021", "text": "Wishing all of you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!  I am looking forward to 2022 being an outstanding year for my family and I hope it will be for yours as well.I have never posted much about health issues and sad things and troubling things but I am going to share something with you today.In 2013 I was diagnosed with cancer.  I sort of knew I had it but then things progressed to the point that I could no longer ignore it.  I was told that I was lucky because I had the sort that they could get rid of completely, even the very aggressive form that I had.I had surgery and chemo and for 6.5 -7 years I have been on a drug that, for me, has been very difficult to take. I had many side effects from this drug and, to be honest, I have felt like I was at least 90 years old.  I tried not to complain and I stood the test — it was a 5 year drug, I took it for 6+ and never took a pause.Last Wednesday, December 15, I had my annual appointment with my oncologist. He told me that it was time for me to “graduate” — one of his favorite terms.  I ask to what?  He said to “not coming here anymore”.  Did I leap for joy?   Did I hug him and his nurse and throw out a big Hallelujah?  No.  I cried.  He was very taken aback.  He told me that I was cured, it was gone, it wasn’t coming back and I should go live life.  He also told me I could quit taking the difficult med.  Then he bid me adieu and exited the room, leaving me to cope with my feelings. And what were those feelings?Fear.  Fear of not being part of that “culture” anymore.  Fear of nobody watching over me.  And let down — it was a moment I had been waiting for for 8+ years — I should have been happy and I WAS happy but  that was buried somewhere beneath all of the fear and uncertainty that, at the moment, I was swallowed up in.I left.  I didnt get to properly thank him for all he had done for me so I wrote him a note.  For the rest of that day I was in sort of a daze.  I didn’t know what to do with the information I had and the feelings I had.  I decided to just sit and digest it.That was also the last day I took the difficult med.  It has now been 9 days since I had any and I can feel the side effects waning.  I learned that it would be in my system for 7 to 10 days and that after that I would feel some relief from them.  Some of the longer lasting, more severe side effects would take several weeks to go away.  Almost immediately I felt a difference.  I had been getting progressively more crippled with my arthritis worsening every day.  I couldn’t straighten my knees, I couldn’t straighten my fingers, sweeping the floor reduced me to a puddle of tears because of the back pain, I was hot all the time — hot flash hot — my hair is very thin — and the loss of energy was unbelievable.  Almost immediately the joint/muscle pain got better.  I am able to walk without a cane/walker, I swept the floor with considerably less pain, I can now make the Girl Scout salute which I haven’t been able to do for years and I am doing things — laundry, cooking, playing with the dog — actually moving around doing things.So, this Christmas I have received the best gift ever — a clean bill of health and a slow return to a glimpse of my former self.  When I started this journey the one thing that I felt immediately was an overwhelming feeling of gratitude for my doctor, his staff, my family, the air that I was breathing — everything.  Last Wednesday that same intense, overwhelming feeling of gratitude washed over me again.  I hope it never leaves.So, maybe those weren’t tears of fear and the unknown, maybe they were tears of gratitude and a deeper understanding of the meaning of being blessed.Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all!  Make the most of it — I know I am."},
{"title": "Love Hate Relationship with Goodreads", "date": "Wednesday, December 15, 2021", "text": "I like Goodreads.  I really do.  I like to see what my friends are reading and I like getting new recommendations.  I even enjoy the yearly challenge.  What I don’t enjoy, however, is trying to keep up with my challenge.  Things don’t load right, sometimes they duplicate, sometimes they don’t get on it at all.  So, my New Years resolution is to just maintain my reading challenge here on my blog.I have surpassed my challenge this year already and I doubt I will finish another title before the end of the year, but I might.  Even if I don’t, I think I did well as my goal was 25 books and I read a few more than that.I did discover a new series — I seem to be drawn to series — by Hope Callaghan.  I have read all of her “Made in Savannah” series and really like them.  So, when I was done with the Savannah series I started the “Garden Girls” series.  I have read six of those and have enjoyed them as well.  I will continue with that series into the new year.  I am not sure how many titles are in the series but they are quick reads and lots of fun.  I don’t do much “heavy” stuff these days.  The world is already too heavy without me bringing it into my entertainment realm.  So, I recommend these two series by Hope Callaghan and she has a couple of others as well but as for now, I am sticking with the Garden Girls for a while."},
{"title": "Current Situation", "date": "Monday, December 13, 2021", "text": "Let me begin by saying that I am not complaining in any way, shape, or form.  God blessed me with a wonderful, hard working husband who has always provided for our family well and who was raised by a father to be very handy with home maintenance.  In my almost 50 years of marriage he has always managed to take care of our needs while I was a stay at home mom and I never saw anything he couldn’t fix.So, the week of Thanksgiving we found ourselves in a conundrum.  We make yogurt twice a week because he eats it on his diabetic diet.  We double the recipe so we have LOTS of yogurt — two of those very large Pyrex mesuring cups full.  Yesterday we only made one though.  I digress.  The thing is we were due to make yogurt the day before Thanksgiving and I found myself juggling two of these monsters along with a whole turkey and an enormous bowl of potato salad, trying to shove it all in a counter depth refrigerator.  Aside from my hands not letting me stir up the potato salad the frustration of trying get everything into the fridge was mounting.  I mentioned we needed to buy a bigger fridge.I have learned over the years to time those sorts of comments just right because if I do, it will happen. Not being manipulative, just thoughtful and intentional.Lo and behold, a week after Thanksgiving we were buying a new fridge.  Well, a matching oven and microwave combo caught his eye.  Our current oven is the original one in the house and going on 20 years old.  It works fine but I can’t read the temperature display and it sits really low which is not good with Trixie because she wants to “help”.  Very dangerous.So, two days later we had the new oven.  However, he decided to install it himself because he has to alter the cabinet that it goes in.  So, my son in law came over yesterday to help him install it because this thing weighs 200 lbs and I am useless.  Didn’t happen because the hole in the cabinet wasn’t big enough so we will revisit it again this evening after more alteration is done.So, this is my current situation -My house WAS clean.  Now it is a disaster.  Our bulky trash pickup comes once a month and it was just this last week so I suspect I will have this old oven sitting in the corner of the kitchen through the holidays.  The good thing is the week of bulky pickup people drive around and “steal” useable goods.  I am sure the perfectly good oven will go to a home that can use it. We usually try to place the “good” stuff on the curb separate from the truly trash stuff that just needs to go to wherever they take it so it is easy for the scavengers to pick it up.  This time I had a small table and chair set for little kids and since my littles aren’t very little anymore I figured somebody could use it.  So, when one of the trucks came by the gentleman get out of the truck, looked the set all over and put it in the cab of the truck with him.  This made me happy because there are more little memories to be made with that set — it was like new and will serve somebody well for a long time.So, anyway, I am dancing around two ovens in my not-so-huge galley kitchen, the dining room looks like it has been swallowed by packing material and there are tools everywhere.  As I said, though, I am not complaining — I look at that and count my blessings — I have a roof over my head even though it isn’t new and fancy, my husband is still with me to take care of these sorts of things and he enjoys doing it, he has the knowledge to make it happen, I have a son in law who is willing to help and I now have the old refrigerator in the garage so I have lots of room for yogurt.  Life is good.And this is Trixie’s new trick —It is really blurry because she was on the run but when she gets done with her food, we are feeding her out of paper bowls which I recognize isn’t a really good idea but it is helping to get her to eat, she takes the bowl and runs off with it and hides it in her bed.  She is such a pill!"},
{"title": "Trixie part 2", "date": "Friday, December 10, 2021", "text": "Trixie came here as a companion to Bean. That wasn’t enough so her parents acquired Olive as another companion.Olive is a standard poodle. She has very long legs. She is lovable but a lot of dog. We all love Olive and we all love Trixie.  However, They have both have been thrown over by Bean in favor of a third companion—an iPhone.  Her parents weren’t in favor of getting a phone but in light of the computer hacking debacle of last year, they decided to get it for security. It is very secure as it is permanently attached to her arm. I am glad I had kids before the age of technology.  I digress.So since the dogs have fallen from favor with Princess Bean, I decided that I needed to forge more of a bond with the one who lives here instead of treating her like a boarder.  I have learned a lot about Trixie lately.  She has some unusual traits.  I am just going with it and learning to co-exist.As I have mentioned before, Trixie is afraid of the dark. So rather than argue with her about going out at night for the last call I have learned to put her on a short leash, take Hubs with us because she feels safer with Daddy there, and tell her to turn around in circles three times and tinkle.  It works like a charm.  And this happens at 8:30 because if I wait until later she has fallen into such a deep sleep I am checking her pulse and she won’t go which makes a very early morning for me—like 4 am.I have made discoveries about the puppy pads as well.  She will use them beautifully but only if she can’t discern that her little fluffy feet have ever walked on them. If she can detect ANYTHING it is a no go.  She will get close but her feet aren’t going to travel anywhere that MIGHT not be pristine and untouched. So, to keep the cleaning and mopping down to a minimum I do hourly checks on the pads. Fortunately there are only two. I have been giving thought to weaning her to one but I don’t know how well she would handle that sort of confusion.That brings us to food.  I have mentioned we have been having a problem getting her to eat.  As per the vets suggestion I have put her on Purina canned food and Hills kibble. She eats the kibble best from my hand as a treat to go outside like a good girl. Once in awhile she might have a taste of chicken put on top of the kibble and that works. The real challenge is the canned food. A freshly opened can is met with great enthusiasm, she does the happy dance around the kitchen. Once refrigerated is a whole different thing. It must be heated in the microwave. Don’t say it, I know.  This is not Trixie’s bad.  She is just smarter than me.BUT, with that said, she plays kissy face really well and I have nothing better to do than take care of this little fur baby.  I hope you don’t think I am complaining , just trying to give a humorous account of a day in the life of!  We wouldn’t trade her for anything because, after all, it only takes 10 seconds to heat the food!"},
{"title": "And Then There Is Trixie", "date": "Saturday, December 04, 2021", "text": "Trixie is about three years old.  She came to live here as a companion for the Bean.  I had second (and third) thoughts about acquiring a pet, especially a puppy, at my age and with physical limitations.  Some days I think I should have had a fourth thought.  But, I didn’t.Trixie came with baggage that no 4 month old puppy should have.  I just didn’t realize that she would retain that baggage once she was settled in our home.  Now, Trixie isn’t our first dog by a long shot so you would have thought I would have known better.  But, I didn’t.Trixie came from a breeder that I felt was a reputable woman and I still think so.  However, she trained her puppies to puppy pads.  I understand some of her puppies were going to top out at less than 5 lbs which creates a whole different situation when talking about potty training outside, especially in the winter.  Parents of small dogs, chihuahua’s come to mind immediately, sometimes have to create an alternative approach to the issue.  Apparently Barbara did a bang up job training her puppies to pads because the concept has stuck.  The situation here is Trixie is not a 5 lb. delicate Yorkie — she is topping out at close to 15 lbs. and while she is small, she isn’t THAT small.  I thought I could train the pad concept out of her brain.  But, I didn’t.I keep telling myself that the pads get changed on a daily basis, sometimes more, and that it really isn’t much different than a cat box.  In fact, it probably isn’t as bad as an icky cat box — no litter to drag around and, of course, she can’t climb on the kitchen counters to walk around.  So, that is my story and I am sticking to it.However, what I wasn’t ready for is so much of my time being spent trying to get the dog to potty.  We go out on a regular basis — she rolls in the leaves which she is allergic to, she tromps around in the flower bed, she stands stock still at attention while listening to whatever has her attention — but she doesn’t go potty.  She races in to the house and straight to the pad.  So, clearly at age 3, Trixie isn’t housebroken and I am a bad puppy parent because I don’t know how to make it happen.  Seems to be an issue with Yorkies though as I have spoken to others about it and I just get the hopeless laugh.I have also learned that Trixie is afraid of the dark.  We both have to go out with her after dark because she goes out, stands in one place and stares in the direction of the foxes.  Now, she has never seen the foxes but I am sure she can smell them and apparently they scare her.Trixie is also off her food.  I have six bags of various brands of kibble and three brands of wet food and she turns up her nose on a regular basis.  She mopes around, gives me the poor sad doggy look and acts likes she is about to breathe her last — quite the drama queen she is — until we put the steak or chicken down for her and then it is a dance party in the middle of the kitchen.  Methinks she is a master manipulator.  I love Trixie though.  I like it when she lays next to me and puts her head on my ankle.  I like it when she gives me “kissy face” which has mastered beautifully.  I just wish she would eat and potty.  Eat and Potty and repeat.  Ugh.So, that in a nutshell is how Trixie is doing."},
{"title": "Bean Update", "date": "Wednesday, December 01, 2021", "text": "Bean is a tween.  I probably shouldn’t have to say more.  But I will.At her beginning of covid she was in the 4th grade in the neighborhood Catholic school.  It wasn’t going well so when the schools closed that spring it was sort of a blessing for us.  Fall rolled around and schools were still closed so she started 5th grade remotely in the neighborhood public school.Unique to say the least. The technology was glitchy, the instruction was ok but somewhere toward Christmas her device just wouldn’t function. We called in the district technology department and long story short she was being hacked. It was serious enough to call in federal support. That is all I will say.  The last six weeks of the school year found her back in the classroom. Mask on face, new device, and butt in desk. She was elated.  She was experiencing “social life” like she had never known it and I hadn’t seen her that happy since before she started school. This year is proving to be very successful socially and academically  and she seems very happy.This year she is in the sixth grade.  She loves dance classes, hates math, and has discovered —heaven help us—boys.  She is still our little red headed bundle of fun but she is definitely a tween.  Halloween this year.  We think she has quit growing and if so she is going to be short, takes after my mom’s family I suspect.And can’t leave without a shout out to Olive.  She is so big.  So, so,big."},
{"title": "House Reveal", "date": "Tuesday, November 30, 2021", "text": "This post is a long time coming for sure but the project, which was SUPPOSED to be fairly quick, turned out to be more of a project than we thought.  You know how that is, you start something and that leads to another thing and so on and so on.It started after the great Fort Worth Freeze of February 2021.  Every living thing, plant life I mean, perished during this time.  It looked like somebody had gone through all the neighborhoods with a blow torch and singed all the plants.  They started coming back but truly there was no redeeming them.So all of those were removed and replaced with flirt nandinas.  It probably doesn’t really look like much here but there were two layers of shrubs and in part of the bed there were these really treacherous rose bushes.  Great home security because they had thorns so thick and so mean that it would very painful to crawl around in there and my poor husband who is on blood thinners sported all sorts so wounds from those rose bushes for days.  We eventually got it emptied out and started completely over.In the second photo there is an archway of cedar posts painted dark brown.  I am not a huge fan of dark brown and this arch-y thing always looked unfinished to me.  So, we decided to embellish it and I am happy with it, you will see that at the next photo.I decided I wanted to get rid of the dark brown trim — the front door was dark brown and looked like a black hole, the window shutters were dark brown and so was that arch.  We painted the shutters three times before we got the color we wanted but I think we are finally satisfied.  The flower beds look a little sparse but we are liking it so much better than the overgrown, over-tall, jungle that was there.  So, here is Fox Hollow at Prairie now — we are satisfied and we are done.  What do you think?We added the fencing and the brackets to make it a bit more “cottage-y” and more finished looking.This is a faux window that we hang a little flag in — right now there is a Christmas flag but we have been hanging a fox-themed flag to honor Finnegan and Fiona, our resident foxesHad to find a place for the fairy door — just in time for the cooler weather — don’t want the little fairies to get cold.  No, I haven’t been imbibing — Bean just loves this kind of thing so I have to incorporate little bits and pieces here and there.Hard to see them, but Hubs planted over 30 of these Flirt Nandinas.  They will spread out but they will stay low which is good.  I am a little paranoid about shrubs growing up in front of windows — thanks to my mother.  She was always afraid somebody would hide behind them and that stuck with me so no shrubs in front of my windows.)Meet the hubs — painting the shutter for the third time.  I am satisfied with the color, thank goodness, because I didn’t want to have to ask him to paint them again.The wreath I have used for about 25 years.  I was going to make a new one but decided against it and just stuck this one up again.  It has held together pretty well for 25 years, don’t you think?So, anyway, that was our summer/fall project.  I am glad it is over and one of things we did that I didn’t show was paint the porch ceiling a sky blue called “haint” blue — a southern tradition to keep away evil spirits and, apparently, wasps.  I remember my great-grandmother’s house having a blue ceiling.  So, I thought it a cute tradition and brings back memories for me so we went ahead and did it even though Hubs had to stand on a very tall ladder and I stood out there and spotted him because anything above a two step step stool and I am having a nervous rigor.  That is it, we are happy with it and I wonder what you think.  Of course you have to just imagine it before but that isn’t hard — just plug in dark brown everywhere and you get the idea."},

So, I have been thinking about it and aside from being bored out of my mind I have allowed myself to get too involved in social media and online entertainment—like Bubble Pop.  I have neglected my blog and the crafts I got so much enjoyment out of so I am making a concerted effort to shift my gears.  I hope it works because I just don’t think I am spending my time wisely.I promised pics of the changes we did on the house and I will do that tomorrow.  We are happy with our new cottage look.

{"title": "Funny Day", "date": "Thursday, September 23, 2021", "text": "I have not worn a dress since my daughter got married in 2004.  I always wear slacks/jeans/pants of some sort to sort of camouflage my slightly bowed left knee (thank you Arthur-it is).  Well, it has been really hot here so I decided to buy a couple of dresses to wear around the house — just sort of knit shift affairs.  They are cute and trendy and looked so coolMine isn’t this cute little coral number but rather a blue and turquoise stripe and it doesn’t look like this on this rather old and roundish body but it was cool, as in temperature.  We were having some work done on the front porch and so I was going to be home all day so I decided to wear it around the house.  I have to say it wasn’t as light and freeing as I thought it would be.  We had a cold front come through yesterday morning and it cooled things off very nicely and I am usually too warm so I figured this dress would be great.  I was wrong, I was cold.  Then, it came time to pick up the Bean from school and I went alone because Hubs was with the guys doing the work on the front porch and I got to school and realized I hadn’t changed clothes which was very uncomfortable because not being used to wearing dresses I felt like I had left part of my clothes at home! I was not comfortable at all and decided that if I am going to wear dresses — and that is a big “if”,  I am going to have to wear leggings.  I never really understood leggings being one of the panty hose generation, but I think I do now.  Today I go back to my jeans.  And it is another cool day.  I think I will be more comfortable.I promised photos of the front flower beds when we were done and I am going to share those but we had a post on the porch replaced and now we need to do some painting.  I am anxious to get it done before the weather really turns cool which won’t be until the end of October.  I think it will all look nice but we are going to have to buy some tarps to cover the new bushes should we have a repeat of last winter which froze everything into oblivion.  This is Texas, that isn’t supposed to happen.  But, it did.  So, that is what is on our agenda for the next month or so.  We have to wait a couple of weeks before we start painting because the new post is cedar and isn’t quite dried out.  We only have a little trim to paint so it won’t take long.  Hopefully. We are also adding a little rail to the porch.  I think it will look much more finished and it will give me a good spot for doing a bit of seasonal decor.  I don’t usually do  much because I am not up for spending money on stuff like that but I wouldn’t mind doing something.  I need a new Christmas wreath and I really like “real” ones but always use something I have made because I can keep it over the years.  In a couple of days I am going for faux pumpkins.  Never had faux pumpkins before but am going to now.So, yes, fall has fallen here at Fox Hollow at Prairie, at least for a few days so I am going to enjoy it.  I might even make pumpkin bread.  No promises."},
{"title": "Hello, all! ", "date": "Friday, September 03, 2021", "text": "Things have been busy around Fox Hollow on Prairie lately.  School started a couple of weeks ago and along with it comes all the horror of Covid.  The schools are full of it, no mask mandates, and no real plan for when it crashes and burns.  We learned today that Bean was in close contact yesterday with somebody who tested positive. We are less than thrilled but it is inevitable I suppose.  Fortunately she is wearing her mask and washing her hands and using sanitizer but it is incredibly horrific when thinking about the littles.  In addition to all of that hot mess, we have been working on our front flower beds.  I say “we” but I mean the Hubs — I went out once in a while to make sure he hadn’t collapsed in the heat but it was all him.  Here is a before - The shrubs in the front are loropetulum which died during the winter and they came back out but they looked awful.  The people who did the landscaping before we came had it all layered and stacked and things were growing into each other.  There were these scraggly rose bushes that had killer thorns and I really didn’t like them.  They didn’t survive the winter either so we just took those out.  In fact, we just started over.I will post pics of the “after” when we get the mulching done but  it is much improved.  Now we have to have some repair work done on the front porch and then paint.  All before winter.  I am sort of looking at turquoise as an accent color and, of course, haint blue on the ceiling of the porch.  I have to have that.  So, we have a bit of work to do but not so much that it will run into winter.  I am looking forward to having it all done and I really do like the way it is going to look.I have been reading a whole lot too.  Trixie has to go to bed at 9 p.m. and I go with her but not ready for bed so I read.  I have subscribed to Kindle Unlimited and it is working out well — I don’t feel so bad giving up on a book now. The one I am reading now “The Winter Cottage” has sucked me right in.  It is good and I can’t wait to get to reading time tonight!  I will let you know how it goes.So, that is all for this evening.  Looking forward to the long weekend but our plans for my daughters birthday have been put on hold since Bean has been exposed — we are just going to sort of quarantine and then get tested.  This stuff really needs to go away.Anyway, have a wonderful, long, healthy weekend!"},
{"title": "Thank you! And Book Review!", "date": "Sunday, August 08, 2021", "text": "Good morning everybody!  I hope your Sunday is proving to be a good one.  It is hot here and humid and I think that is going to be the story here for the next week.  I am not going to complain, though, because it has been a cooler summer all around so I am not going to say anything.  Going into fall we have a tendency toward bad weather, like in spring, so I don’t want to rush things.   First off, thanks to everybody that is helping me recover blog addresses.  I read my blog list almost every day and I have missed doing that the last couple of days so later on I am going to work on reconstructing it.  I really appreciate your help.I finished “The Art of Inheriting Secrets”.  It was very good although there were some not so great reviews.  I liked it.  I will say that as the book went on all the attention to details were sort of diluted a bit, not as prevalent as in the beginning but it was a good book with a happy ending and a couple of twists in the middle so it made me happy and I do recommend.I am now moving on to my next read — The fourth installment of the Palmetto Isle series.  The first three were good and I am hoping this one is as well.  It will go fast I am afraid so I need to be on the lookout for the next in my queue.  For once, I think I might meet my Goodreads goal.  Miracle!I have been having so much trouble with my knees, back and feet that the other day I just took my shoes off and let my feet rest on the cool tile floor.  I was thinking back to my younger days — yes, I can remember that far back although it is getting a little fuzzy — but I was always barefoot in the house.  My pediatrician told my mother, when I was learning to walk, to let me go barefoot and I always did.  When I started having knee issues I started wearing shoes all the time and the issues have just gotten worse and worse so I decided to try without shoes again.  Amazingly the knee was a smidge better yesterday.  And my back wasn’t too bad either.  So, I think I have been mistakingly looking at my knees as the problem when it could be my feet.  I will keep you posted on my progress because I am absolutely sure this is scintillating stuff! Haha!I think I mentioned that I have given up sugar.  It has been about three weeks or a little longer.  I decided to get on the scale this morning.  I have lost four pounds.  I can’t believe it.  Just a million more to go.  I won’t keep you posted on that subject — well, maybe — because I am sure it isn’t interesting to anybody but me.Ok, well, that is it for now.  I have a list of things, projects to start working on — one is organizing photographs — sounds like fun doesn’t it?  Not.  Not one bit.  We will talk more about this later.  Have a great day!"},

Feel free to visit his site — I have a special fondness in my heart for cartoonists — they are a breed apart — my father was one of the group and his friends have become my friends.  So, check out Donnie’s page.I got a little farther in the book I am reading.  It is getting much more tense in many areas — like, the house is falling down.  The relationship between Samir and Olivia is heating up.  And Grant is being a complete idiot so out of control.  I will leave it at that.  The book is set in modern day England, in case I never made that clear, and I guess I went to sleep with it on my mind and I dreamed I was in Wales. Which I know isn’t England but it is the ancestral home I identify with most.  Most all of my family is from England or Wales so I identify with it stronglyOk, I guess I am going to go try to put my blog back together.  I don’t think I can get it back electronically so I will just have to try to remember.  Hahahah! Yeah, have a good day and let me hear from you!"},
{"title": "The Wild Wild World of my Back Yard", "date": "Wednesday, August 04, 2021", "text": "I have to admit that my husbands camera was a unique way of offering up some breakfast table entertainment.  It is fun to view the feed as we eat our oatmeal and blueberries.  It looks like the foxes are spending less time here and the other critters are coming around more. I think it is a seasonal thing.And this morning, around 9 a.m. my phone signaled that there was activity on the deck and when I pulled up the footage this is what I found —Now this cat has been coming around the whole time we have lived in this house so I figure she knows the foxes are here.  It is surprising to me that she is sitting there watching the spot that the foxes come and go.I am sure she is looking for a spot to have babies because she is so clearly expecting but I would like for her to find another place.  I don’t need kitties becoming a fox snack.  That will make me very upset.So, this is the first time we have caught the cat on the camera and I was really surprised although she likes to join my husband in the garage from time to time when he is out there working on a project.  I can handle the cat, I just don’t want the foxes taking a liking to him!I have done quite a lot of reading on my current book “The Art of Inheriting Secrets” and it is a page turner for sure.  I don’t want to share too much because you might actually want to read it.  All I will say is that Grant is history, Sam is the future and the mystery unfolds in ways you didn’t expect.  Or at least I didn’t. I will add that the food sounds wonderful!  Ok, that’s all.  Maybe more tomorrow."},
{"title": "New Header Photo", "date": "Monday, August 02, 2021", "text": "I added a new header photo so you can see what we are dealing with.  Meet Finley and Fiona Foxx.  One of their children is running around someplace.  They are wet because it is raining.  I wanted it to rain so I could read — see how well that worked out?  I digress.Finley and Fiona played on the deck most of the night.  In one or two camera captures we saw a younger one.  And we even got a snap of Penelope Possum.  She has been around for a long time and we have even seen what is probably one of her kiddos — a much smaller version of herself.  I guess foxes don’t care for  possum.  That is good I guess.  However, if my childhood pediatrician were here, he would be trapping them to eat them.  He liked possum.  Yech!!!!   It is getting dark earlier.  Have you noticed?  I took Trixie out for her last call at about 8:30 and it was already dark so we stayed close to the house — far away from the deck.  However, I looked along the fence line as I always do because that is how Penelope travels, and I was met with two glowing  eyes staring at me from under a lantana plant.  I don’t know if it was a possum or a fox but I told Miss Trixie to get a jiggle on because I wasn’t staying out there for very long.  It is one thing to watch the shenanigans on a camera feed but when you feel like you are being watched, in person, and discover you ARE — quite another thing altogether.I read until midnight on my new kindle and I would love to share with you what is going on in “The Art of Inheriting Secrets” but that would spoil it now wouldn’t it?  Don’t you always form a mental image of the characters in your mind when you read?  Well, my idea of Olivia was shattered last night in the passages of her going to dinner at Pavi’s restaurant “Coriander”.  Now I have to rethink the whole thing!  This book certainly has a lot of imagery to help form those images, it is very easy to place yourself there mentally and it is very enjoyable.  This is the second book I have read by Barbara O’Neal and I definitely recommend.Well, I guess I will go try to accomplish what I didn’t accomplish yesterday.  I think when I fell last year and wiped out my wrist I also damaged my back.  I don’t think anything was broken but I do know I have arthritis in my back and my hip and it seems to be a lot worse these days.  It seems I am sitting down between tasks so much more often than I used to and some days I don’t get up at all. So, word to wise, old people shouldn’t fall down! So, on that note — well, we will see how the day goes."},
{"title": "Hmmm……It’s Gone", "date": "Sunday, August 01, 2021", "text": "I wrote a rather lengthy, albeit dull, post last night and it doesn’t seem to have posted.  Maybe the powers that be decided it was not post-worthy.  Oh well, it probably wasn’t.  It was just about my shopping habits and my reading habits and all that has been covered before so maybe it is for the best.I have been reading a book titled “The Art of Inheriting Secrets” by Barbara O’Neal.  It is about Olivia Shaw, an American (native Californian to be exact) who learned, upon her mother’s death, that she has inherited a gigantic manor house in England that is falling apart and a title.  She is Lady Olivia Shaw, Countess of Rosemere Priory.  Now, Olivia’s mother never told her about any of this — the house, the title, her life before immigrating to California — this came out of the blue and has sort of gob smacked Olivia.  Needing to deal with the legalities she made a trip to England to sort things out and learned that while she knew nothing of this part of her mother’s life, everybody knew her! And they were jolly well not very thrilled about her being there! Clearly there is a mystery to be solved, a romantic take on it considering she is very disenchanted with her American fiancé and has met the very charming Samir (Sam).  So, that is where I am — It is getting to that point that I can’t put it down.  I love it when that happens.  Now if it would just rain a bit!  Perfect reading environmentI have always liked, in my writing, to name my house.  I like the British idea of naming houses — here we don’t do that officially but I like the idea.  In my new house, the one we are currently in that isn’t really new except to me, I have had difficulty coming up with a name.  I have been calling it Brinkley Cottage but I think I have come upon something much more fitting — Fox Hollow on Prairie.  Clearly this has something to do with the fox population inhabiting our back yard.I have been doing a lot of reading about grey foxes and they are really pretty interesting.  They aren’t a species to be feared particularly which is good — unless you are a mouse, rat or, their favorite, a cotton tailed rabbit.  I have seen them with all of those.  They do, however, leave the possum alone and we seem to have two of those that trip through the yard.Anyway, it seems that they are denners and only use their dens during mating/birthing season which is January/April.  It takes 53 days for the pregnancy to complete and once the babies are born it takes them about 4 months to become fully independent and able to hunt without their parents.  I think this is the period of time that we came to be fully aware of their presence.  We have had several captures of four of them on our camera — two clearly smaller than the other two — and we assumed they were pups — or kits — or cubs whichever name you prefer.  Well, over the course of two or three weeks we have watched them run like crazy, play, catch mice and climb trees — yes, climb trees which I didn’t realize foxes did but the ability only lies with grey foxes not red foxes.  Apparently they also like to rest in trees, like cats.  Fortunately I haven’t seen that yet.In the last two weeks we have seen the youngsters disappear which makes sense because at about 4 months they go off to do their own thing.  We have seen the other two come around less and less and not really hang out for very long and for the last few days, there has only been one.  From what I have read, once the mating/child rearing season is over and the babes are gone, the parents leave because they only use the den for mating/child rearing purposes and they don’t live there full time.  Kind of like Airbnb for foxes.  At that point, which is where we are at, they will leave and most likely come back in January when the whole cycle starts again because it seems they return to the den they have previously used. So, it is probably not unusual to see them less and less and perhaps they will go away completely until winter.  While I have enjoyed watching them after being initially terrified of them, I wouldn’t mind if they went away forever.  Not destroyed, just maybe find a better den.  We have closed up three sides of the deck and if I knew they were gone I would have Hubs close up the fourth but they do burrow so if they wanted to get in they could  by digging under — seems the only way to get rid of them short of having them picked up is to dismantle the deck and I doubt that is going to to happen so I guess we will have to learn to co-habitate.  Maybe they will leave until January — that would be good too.  I will take it.I really can’t believe it is August! What happened to summer?  I am upset over the surges in covid again — Texas is a hot spot — and I am not looking forward to the chaos that will ensue when school starts.  But, I will be glad for the weather to cool down.  I am really over the heat and it hasn’t really been that bad but I am dealing with it less and less as I age.  So, I am going to get a cool drink and meet up with Olivia Shaw and see what is going on at Rosemere Priory."},

They start coming about about 9:30 pm and go back to their den about 6 a.m.  I would like to have them trapped and relocated by my husband likes watching them.  Who knew foxes could climb trees.  I am writing a book.  My cousin wrote his memoirs about growing up in our hometown of San Antonio and I decided it would be fun to do that as well so I have been working on that a bit.  I am also watching a youtube vlogger named Noemi — the vlog is called “Scandish Home”.  It is interesting and relaxing and all she really does in clean her house and do remodeling projects.  It is inspiring though and fun to watch.  I can’t believe it is already the end of July.  I can’t believe school is starting.  I can’t believe that covid is rearing it’s ugly head again.  Ugh.  So stressful."},

{"title": "Good Morning!", "date": "Thursday, June 24, 2021", "text": "Good morning, all!  How are things in your neighborhood this morning?  I seem to be having technical difficulties with blogger this morning.  I guess I have been gone so long that it is in shock.  What a pain.A couple of weeks ago I bought a new iPad and a keyboard to go along with in anticipation of doing more blogging.  Well, for some reason, when I try to post a comment or respond to one, it no longer wants to let me put spaces between the words with the space bar.  Very annoying. I guess I will have to continue to fiddle with it to see if it is my iPad or blogger but I am not having any difficulties creating a post.  So…..hmmm.I am not a gardener.  I love a beautiful yards and lovely flower beds but I am just not of the nature to create it.  We do have a few things that the previous owner had planted that I do enjoy.  So, here is a photo of the lovely lantana that comes up in all the flower beds every year.That flower bed runs behind the breakfast area and it is full of lantana and purpose planted clover.  The clover is gorgeous early morning with its lavender flowers and when it is not blooming we have the lantana.  Unfortunately, after entertaining ourselves with feeding the birds, we also have sunflowers now.  I don’t like sunflowers.  But…..Trixie likes to smell them so until they die or Hubs yanks them out, I guess we have sunflowers.Still reading “When We Believed in Mermaids” but almost finished.  I am enjoying it but it is getting more graphic as I go along and while not cringe worthy it takes me a bit out of my comfort zone.  Still a good read though and I am looking forward to the ending where all is revealed.  I do recommend it with the caveat that there are some things that might not sit well.  Still working on Bean’s room.  I ordered a dust ruffle which I generally don’t like, especially on a day bed but it is here and washed and ready to be put on the bed which is what I am doing this morning.  Why don’t I like dust ruffles on the daybed, you might ask? The bed is hard to make up anyway, have to take the mattress off to change the sheets, and then the dust ruffle just gets all messed up and it is a struggle but it is a trundle bed and I need to cover the trundle so there you have it.  Then I am going to hang some more art and contemplate getting a new lamp.  However, the parrot lamp is staying where it is.  I will take photos when it is done.  For months we have been struggling with Hubs glucose levels.  He is on a new medication which is helping and we are following the diet pretty well.  However, he loves to eat out.  Eating is out is trial and error — mostly error— and we are learning what he can’t eat without his blood sugar spiking.  Sandwiches.  They are bad.  Pizza.  Pizza for a diabetic is like a candy bar.  Rice.  Never going to happen in this house again which is really unfortunate because I like rice and it is the base for a lot of good recipes but any more than a couple of tablespoons has his sugar off the charts.  So, I am still learning a few good things — like avocado tacos.  So good.  So easy.  So, now I am off to start sewing Girl Scout patches on a new vest.  Our sweet Bean bridged to a Cadette last month and she is now in khaki.  Daisy blue and junior green are a thing of the past and now we are in the most icky color there is but it will showcase all her patches really well.  She and her mother and another GS mother/daughter combo took a little patch excursion to Missouri to do the Little House on the Prairie tour.  They had a wonderful time but it was hotter than they thought.  They did veer off from the Little House exhibits and visited the St. Louis arch and they spent some time in Little Rock visiting Little Rock Central High School.  They had a wonderful time and are now planning to go to Minnesota to see more Laura Ingalls Wilder places.  Hopefully it will be coolerIsn’t that house cute?  Isn’t Bean growing up?  My advice to young mothers — don’t blink! Before you know it they are 5 ft tall and wearing khaki!"},
{"title": "Shopping Online", "date": "Wednesday, June 23, 2021", "text": "Hi, all!  I was thinking about the last year and a half  and all the changes to our lives we have had to deal with.  I am thinking they aren’t all bad.  What do you think?  What changes have you made that you intend to keep now that life is getting back to normal — sort of?  I can think of one for myself.That would be online shopping.I had already done a good deal of online shopping prior to Covid but the stay at home orders made it even more necessary.  I find I like it a LOT.  I can take my time, browse my favorite sites, read reviews and honestly, in my case, make better purchasing decisions.Over the course of this year I have sort of re-invented myself.  I have developed a sort of capsule wardrobe with a particular color scheme.  My hair is now all gray in a shade I like to call “Mouse”.  So, my colors are black, white, gray, and navy —and my accent colors are red and turquoise — all colors complimentary of a “Mouse”.  I have narrowed down my shopping venues to stores (Lands End being one) that have products that I know fit me and the quality is good so I don’t stray from those.  My feet are a pain -  literally — so I have really given up trying to buy trendy shoes and have narrowed my choices down to those I can get from a shoe company called SAS.  Some of their stuff is a little weird but they are made well, made in the USA and readily available for online shopping and, if necessary, local return.  Another place that changes have been made is in hair care.  I really don’t like going to salons so not being able to really wasn’t a problem for me.  I can cut my own hair well enough to make do and most times I honestly prefer it even with it’s slight wonky-ness.  My hair still retains some chemo curl and I have been stressing over how thin it has become — thin curls, never a good look.  So I purchased some hair thickening shampoo from Living Proof and it is really nice.  It makes my hair feel completely different and when I use some Giovanni hair gel, it is actually acceptable.  I don’t dry it anymore, I just scrunch it so the curls will form and let it air dry.  Then I “comb” it with my fingers and voila — I am a puff ball.  It is good enough for me.Nail care is something I have stressed over for years.   I have never had great nails and always wanted long, glossy, manicured nails.  Fugidaboutit.  Not gonna happen.  My latest foray into nail care was getting sucked into the Olive and June system which guarantees the polish will stay on for two weeks.  Uh, not on me.  It was peeling off in two days.  So, I have now settled on a nail care routine that doesn’t involve much of anything except general maintenance and it is a win for me because my nails, when long, tend to break in the quick and I am hoping for less of that. It hurts.Make up is almost a thing of the past now.  I have never worn much but now I have it down to a system too.  Skin care is the thing I spend my time and money on.  I have cleaned out my make up drawer and honestly, literally, just thrown out money because I don’t buy cheap stuff. I try for clean these days — trying to do my body a favor — and some of it works and most of it doesn’t.  So the one thing that is gone forever is foundation.  I was never good with foundation because I have a rather strange skin tone and have never been able to match it very well.  Apparently after much research I have a Celtic complexion which make sense considering my dna and my coloring is that of a pink salt lamp so the process of finding a clean, non-toxic foundation is pretty daunting and the pay off is not worth the aggravation.  Plus, in the Texas heat it lasts for about a minute.  So, I have narrowed it down to a few items and after experimenting with several clean brands and one not so clean (Glossier) I have decided that my cosmetics of choice will come from Jane Iredale.  I love the Glossier products but they aren’t as clean as I like and maybe it isn’t a big deal since I don’t wear it every day but if I keep it to JI then I don’t have to constantly be researching product safety.So, all these things are what has kept my mind busy through these months of isolation.  I have had the opportunity to sort through and suss out what really works for me.  There is more and I will touch on that later but for now I can say that the lesson I have learned during this whole difficult time we have all lived through is my new rule of life is to be true to myself.  Sounds like a 50’s song and it is a concept that I wish I had embraced in my younger years rather than being a sheep and following the crowd.  But, better late than never and I can honestly say, for the first time in my life, I am finally comfortable in my own skin.  And comfortable with online shopping!"},
{"title": "A Beautiful Day In the Neighborhood", "date": "Tuesday, June 22, 2021", "text": "Today was a really lovely day, unlike the last two weeks.  The weather has been excessively warm, I am certain warmer than the norm for June, and I have felt pretty much like I am roasting.  We have had two rare summer cold fronts come through however and today felt like a lovely spring day.  Tomorrow we are back to normal.  Sigh.I decided to spruce up one of my extra bedrooms, the one Bean stays in when she is over.  I have an elaborate  black iron daybed in there along with an antique chest, a black chest of drawers and a bookcase.  In my last house I had the bed covered in a cute black and beige toile set with a matching shower curtain in the adjoining bathroom.  I have grown tired of it, however, and wanted something lighter and brighter.  So I replaced the set with white covers and lavender pillows with blue accent pillows.  I will share pics when I am done.  I have also hung some of Bean’s artwork that she has gifted me and it is much livelier in there now.  I have a little lamp that goes with nothing.  It has a parrot on it.  I love it.  I thought about swapping it out with something more in keeping with the new color scheme but I just can’t let go of that little parrot lamp.I have been doing quite a bit of reading lately.  My latest titles have been The Titanic Sisters and The Paris Seamstress.  Both of these books were page turners and I recommend both of them.  At the moment I am reading When We Believed in Mermaids.  It is a page turner as well — the story of two sisters and Dylan. It is sad, a mystery, full of secrets, full of romance, full of promise and full of hurt.  It is intense and again, a page turner.  I am almost three quarters of the way through and, at this point, I recommend.  I might change my tune when I am done — we will see.I  also read My San Antonio Childhood: A Memoir written by Michael L. Hall.  Michael L. Hall is my cousin’s husband. He grew up in San Antonio, went to college in Texas and then ventured out into the wider world.  After a lot of education and a long career, he and my cousin are back in Texas and he has written his memoir.  It is a fun read, brought back many memories of time and place since I, too, grew up in San Antonio.  I recommend it as well and it is available on Amazon.I haven’t been feeling all that well lately so I decided to take the bull by the horns, act like a grown up lady and come to terms with my “issue”.  My “issue” is that I am addicted …… to cookies.  And, not just any cookies — chocolate chip cookies.  I can pass up anything else, haven’t had a soda in years and years but I have a cookie problem.  I don’t drink alcohol or participate in any sort of drug taking so I figure the reason I feel so rotten is my diet.  By rotten I mean my achy joints and lack of energy and by diet I mean the cookies because I prepare and eat nutritious meals and in a moderate amount.  So I did some research on cookie addiction and who knew - it is a THING!  Apparently chocolate chip cookies are as addictive as cocaine.  There is research and papers and it is a thing.  Not just cookies in general, but chocolate chip cookies specifically. So, I decided my copious amount of chocolate chip cookie ingestion is making me feel bad so the grown up lady thing to do is tell myself “Melissa, you are bigger than this cookie and you can conquer the cookie”.  So, I have gotten rid of all the cookies in the house — chocolate chip and all others — and I have made up my mind to not fall down that rabbit hole again.  I also decided to be diligent about taking my vitamins.  I have just felt draggy and sluggish and since I have had anemia problems before I started thinking that maybe I was running a little anemic again.  I could go get my blood work done but that would make my doctor absolutely giddy — he loves to do bloodwork.  And we don’t want him too giddy.  I digress.So, anyway, since I haven’t had any sugary anything for almost two weeks and I have been vitaminized — I feel better!  I have had energy, I am re-doing rooms and cleaning house and cooking a lot and my knees aren’t hurting as much.  Now, I realize that a lot of my joint pain and muscle aches are side effects of a medication I take but I still feel different.  So, yeah, conquering cookies has been taking up a lot of my time.We have been very slow to get back out in the covid laden world even though we are both completely vaccinated.  We are being cautious but gradually getting out and about.  We had doctors appointments yesterday and stopped at our favorite coffee shop for a coffee and roll afterward.  We actually went in, sat separated from everybody else and had a glorious thirty minutes.  It felt downright normal.  But, to be honest, I am in no hurry to jump back into “normal”.  Part of me has enjoyed the isolation of this pandemic.  It has given me time to do some thinking about things — I can’t tell you what exactly — but sorting out my feelings about things and what is important and what isn’t.  I had all sorts of plans for my 70th year but I spent it in quarantine.  That gives you something to think about for sure — An entire year of my life spent in my house away from other people.  Jolting.  So, I have done lots of soul searching and I think I have changed as a person — and I think that is probably a good thing so I am not being quick to leave my isolation — it has really been good for me in some respects. So on that note, I have a few dishes to finish and I can call it a day! I am hoping to get back into the blogging groove now that life is getting back to some semblance of normalcy."},

She is in a new school this year having left the parochial school she was in since age 3.  It just wasn’t a good fit anymore.  Now she is swimming in a public school sea with about four times more kids than her previous school but so far so good.Where is this going?  Well, the Gramps and I are sitting in a new pick up line observing students age 10 to 12 and I have to say it is a very dismal view.  One girl has half her hair dyed back and the other side maroon.  Texas Tech fan perhaps? Doubtful.  One boy has his head shaved on one side with the other side flowing almost shoulder  length.  And they all wear black.  Or gray.  Or black that has been   washed to gray.  Nobody ties their shoes.  Nobody brushes their hair.They all look terrible.When I was that age, in school, we got dressed — up.  We had natural colored hair and wore hair clips and   head bands and petticoats and matching cardigans.  We wore skirts and sweaters from Bobbie Brooks and penny loafers.  The most scandalous thing we did was wear a cardigan backwards. Tattoos were for sailors.So, I am certainly getting an education on the fashion sense of tweens in Texas these days.  It isn’t good.  But I do have one question—-Where are these kids parents? Or am I just hopelessly out of touch?"},

He was born in Pennsylvania to Welsh immigrants.  He didn’t talk much but what he did say about his life in Pennsylvania was enough to stir my interest.  As a result, I have always identified  myself , after American and Texan, as Welsh.   I guess most people lean toward one thing or another in their ancestry.  Mine is Welsh.I have an interest in the language so once in awhile I look up Welsh words and pronunciations.  So far I know three.  Really zipping along, aren’t I? Today I learned croeso—welcome.  It is  pronounced croy-saw.  There is a really good youtube video by a guy with the last name Hugh who pronounced these words beautifully.   I also know diolch which means thanks or gratitude and cwtch, pronounced cutch, like butch, which means a cuddle or hug, the Welsh version of hygge.I wish I had asked more questions of my grandfather.  We knew a lot about his Mam, she was English born but Welsh raised.  According to census records she was a Welsh speaker and family history tells us she was very short, loved her children fiercely and was totally intolerant of anything she didn’t think was right.  She was also very religious which is why there are only a couple of photos of her.  She also needed a baby name book because she was dismal at naming her children.We really don’t know anything about my great grandfather except he was jovial, could expand his chest to 52 inches and died young of lung disease.  I am having difficulty locating his parents.  However, he and my great grandmother lost two babies in Wales and I am well on my way to finding them now.  We had heard stories of two babies being buried there but nobody had  names or specifics but through modern technology I have found them and an getting the documentation now.So what do you do during pandemic lockdowns?  You learn words in the mother tongue!  My conversations will be limited though — welcome, thankful and cuddle.  Well ok, at least they are positive words.Oh and I love dragons and daffodils And Celtic music talks to my soul.  So, that’s it!

Five  minutes on each side.  Perfection.  I will be doing that again.I decided to  start walking in my house for exercise.  I have a long galley kitchen that goes directly into the breakfast area which makes a nice path.  I did four or five passes earlier and will do more through the day. I don’t walk enough which just makes the knee worse.  The funny thing is, though, Trixie follows  me everywhere so she was walking laps with me and looking at me, the whole time, like I had lost my mind.  Maybe I have.  Do you watch the Super Bowl?  It will be on.  I won’t watch it.  Not very interested, even in the commercials.  I will be reading my new reading start The Magdalen Girls by V. S. Alexander.  It has been on my shelf for literally years and it is time to start reading books I already have rather than buying new ones.Speaking of books, however, I have to say that I really enjoy my kindle.  So much, so, that I have subscribed to Kindle Unlimited.  It is really great, as I think I have mentioned before, and last night I even looked at a magazine!  It was great.  I read the magazine and returned it and didn’t have to pay for it or store it.  Love it!Ok, that’s all.  Need to gather up some items for the trash and maybe, maybe, vacuum before the football game.  For dinner we will be having breakfast which we do once a week so it is going to be  relaxing, albeit cold, day. I just finished book #5 in my Goodreads challenge. The title is Exes and Woes by Hope Callaghan.  It is #14 in the Made in Savannah series.  I began this series after visiting Savannah and falling in love with the city.  These books don’t talk about the city much but you get the vibe.  These are not serious mysteries, just fun little cozies that you can sort of get lost in.  There is one more about Christmas and that might be my next read.I recommend this series if you just want to cuddle up and get lost in a fun book!"},

Sacagewa, the story of the young Native American that was instrumental in the Lewis and Clark expedition.  Another is Fly Away Home that was read for ELA.  There are two more that I have to get the exact title off the book which is at her house.  Next week we will be learning  about immigration so more reading.  I will add those books when we are done.The other two books are the last two in the Coming Back to Cornwall series.  I have now finished the series and have to say I would recommend it to everybody.  It is such a quiet peaceful read but certainly not boring or without conflict.  After reading all these books, I feel like the characters are real and I know them well.  It just flowed beautifully.I have now started on the 14th book of the Made in Savannah series .  I  have read the entire series as well except for the last two and it is a great little cozy mystery series.  It is full of colorful characters and comedic relief.  I started reading this after falling in love  with Savannah.  It is very enjoyable and I recommend."},
{"title": "The Times They Are A’ changing", "date": "Saturday, January 30, 2021", "text": "Yesterday Bean asked me how we danced “back then”.  I showed her a YouTube video of American Bandstand from 1967.  She watched, she looked at me and she said “that’s weird”.  Well, thank you very much.  Not as weird as today, I thought.I am on a Facebook group titled “born in the 50’s, raised in the 60’s”. I have to laugh because every time I see a post I have either used the product, had the shoes, created mile high hair or SOMETHING of the era.  It all feels so familiar and normal.However, things are changing for me, gradually and  mostly out of necessity.   I can’t dance like we did “back then” and it seems there are a lot of other things I can’t do anymore either.  So, adjustments have to be made.  Some I just think are fun to do.Let’s start with laundry detergent.  I broke my wrist in May.  They said in a year I would be able to do 80% of what I normally do.  That is not easily interpreted until you actually put it into practice.  There are a lot of things I can’t do and I don’t think that is going to be different in May.  One thing I can’t do is open the jars of laundry pods.  They are big and awkward and I just can’t do it without using bad language.  So, I am giving this a go—It is a little box of cute little strips of paper, or something, embedded with detergent. You just throw it in and wash as usual.  It is supposed to be eco friendly and fragrance free.  I can see it being good for travel if you need to rinse out something in the hotel room. Easy to carry.   Am on my second load right now and I will let you know how it works. I had thought about going back to making my own detergent but that requires soap grating, unless I want to use my food processor and  I don’t think so.  I don’t think I want to use a hand grater  either.  Hopefully these little strips will work.Another thing I have been doing is making my own foaming hand soap.  I don’t need to do this but using liquid Castile soap and water is pretty cost effective.  I did have to buy the bottles but that isn’t a recurring expense and my husband actually likes it, which is a are occurrence.Another thing that has changed about my life is reading.  I have always been an avid reader, always have a book going.  I love physical books.  However I have run out of space so I have moved on to ebooks and a cute little kindle.  Well I tend to haul the kindle with me wherever I go as well as my iPad.  Lots of schlepping of devices and chargers and such so I have also decided to pare it down to one thing. So, the iPad won out.  I have the kindle app on it and I subscribe to kindle unlimited so I can actually read a lot for free.  That is good because if I don’t like something to can just return it and not have wasted money or bookshelf space.  It is different from overdrive as well as there are no end dates.  You can keep it as long as you want.I talked to my eye dr about reading on devices and he said it is fine.  I still read on the little kindle when I read in bed.  The kindle and the iPad sync up so you go between the two.  I resisted at first and have done lots of research to dissuade me from using a device but I just can’t give it up.  It is too convenient and easy to obtain reading material in this time of being stuck in the house.So yes, times are changing but it isn’t all bad.  Age and circumstances beyond our control are forcing some changes but if you keep an open mind and are willing to try new things you might just like it. In the words of the famous Jack Sparrow ”the problem isn’t the problem, the problem is your attitude toward  the problem.”Gotta love Johnny Depp!"},

I saw my father in a completely different light.  He was just a kid.  He was homesick and missing his wife and his life.  He talked about kids they would have.  I sensed my mother’s insecurity about him being gone for so long. I could sense his fatigue and almost desperation at wanting to be home.  He sounded like a teenager trying to be a grownup, talking about how life was going to be.  There are no words to express the emotions that were running rampant as I read.  I will read them again.  Someday."},

No, not strange, just divine intervention. So, thank you Pastor Bob for such a wonderful sermon.  I enjoyed the music included and the children singing were adorable — and I loved their leaping!  I will be back for sure.Today’s menu includes beef stew.  I will try to take photos but there isn’t much interesting about beef stew, is there? Yes, my husband doesn’t think so either but this icky day seems to just scream for some comfort food.  The rest of the day will be reading, visiting my own church later this morning, and more laundry.  There is always laundry, isn’t there?  I am going to make a stab at getting back to my cross stitch project but somehow my motivation for that has gone AWOL.  I know that if I could just get started I wouldn’t be able to put it down but it is the getting started part that I am stuck on.  So, on to the next load of laundry and maybe a second cup!"},

Bacon fryingChopped veggiesVoila! Calabacita!Recently, when I bought the shiny sneakers, I realized I needed some new socks.  I am not a sock person, never have been.  When I was in school it could be absolutely frigid and I would be all dolled up in a skirt and sweater and flats with bare legs.  Hated socks.  However, I decided I needed to get at least a couple of pair.  Maybe bright white socks would tone down the pearlish finish of the shoes.So, an ad  kept popping up on Facebook for socks that don’t cut your legs, are soft and just a class act.  All kinds of colors.  Cute packaging. Cotton or wool.  I ordered three pair of white socks, from the wool collection, never looking at where they came from. They took much longer than I thought to get here so I went looking for them and they were on their way —- from Turkey.  So much for me trying to buy American.  I have yet to try the shoes or the socks.  Maybe tomorrow.  The socks are really soft and I think they might  be good, for socks that is.  I will let you know as soon as I get around to trying them."},
{"title": "Feet", "date": "Wednesday, January 20, 2021", "text": "Feet are funny things, aren’t they?  I mean, we all know it and Dr. Seuss even wrote a book about it.  Feet aren’t very pretty so we try to pretty them up by pampering them with lotions and potions and pearly polishes.  You feel good and fancy and special but feet are still what they are, funny things.I have been blessed with many things in my life and I am so, so grateful.  I have also been blessed with two good feet that have served me well.  I am afraid I didn’t always treat them so well, however, walking barefoot on hot pavement, cramming them into stylish shoes that maybe weren’t so good, dancing until they were about to fall off yet here we are, my feet and me, still together after all these years.I have noticed, of late, that my feet are “talking” to me more.  They moan and sigh and generally complain in their own quiet way.  So, I have decided it is time to take better care of my feet.Now, if you know anything about me you know that I am careful about purchases and prefer to buy American made if possible.  We have a shoe manufacturer here in Texas called SAS shoes and all their products are American made.Now SAS shoes are durable, well made, leather (if that is your thing) and just scream “orthopedic”.  They also come in a variety of sizes and widths.  I have a love hate relationship with these shoes and yet I continue to buy them.  So, I have been looking for a nice pair of white sneakers, like Keds only better made. After many Google searches I came back to SAS.  Why you might ask?  Because while my feet have been a blessing, I have to say that I have also been blessed with two feet that aren’t the same size or width.  I always buy shoes to fit the wider foot and the other foot just sort of swims along in the shoe.So I found a pair of nice white sneaks on the SAS site and ordered them.  They came yesterday.  Imagine my horror when I opened the box and the shoes Were a whitish, silvery pearl color.  So here I am thinking my nickname should be twinkle toes.  They aren’t as heavy as their shoes usually are which is good because heavy shoes hurt my knees.  They look cute, if these sorts of shoes can be considered cute but....I still haven’t tried them on.  I am waiting for some new socks I ordered.  Well the good thing is that if they don’t work well or I can’t get my head around that hue, I can always return them locally.  I will let you know."},

I do believe their are some dangerous people in our government and I wish they weren’t there but again, we will see how it goes.  I, personally, am putting my faith in my religious beliefs.  That is what is going to get me through and, hopefully, that is what is going to help me help my friend who is having a really hard time right now.  I was so tired yesterday that I couldn’t eat dinner, much less cook it.  I think the stress over home school has been intense this week and hope that it settles down soon. Tonight hubs is cooking which is good.  I would like to stitch a few stitches on my cross stitch project to see if my hand will hold up.  And I need to run the vacuum now that all the Christmas decor is put away.So, I am off to do more school and enjoy this beautiful day.  Have a good one!"},

I have decided that “fried” and “oven” just don’t work well together.  I am going to start researching air fryers but I really don’t like small appliances.  Sigh.  I hope tomorrow is better and not so many tech glitches with school.  We are supposed to have frozen fog in the morning.  Sounds exciting doesn’t it? Oh, and when I got home this afternoon I discovered that Trixie had shredded her bed.  She tears up anything that is stuffed so I spent the evening searching for a wicker dog bed like my mother had for our dogs.  I finally found one.  Amish made.  Totally unreasonable.  But it isn’t stuffed.  As my aunt like to say— if it’s not one damn” thing it’s another.Second sigh.I think it is time for bed."},

My house, however, is not.  It has snowed all day but nothing has stuck.  So disappointing.  Well, not really.  I am not big on snow.  Or rain.  Or ice....you get the picture.  So, the snow was a bust.See, no snow.Ok, so moving on to the enchiladas.  Now,  being from South Texas, I have eaten Mexican food since I cut my teeth!  My mother cooked it, so did my grandmother and my aunt so how, I wonder, could I not have any cumin in the kitchen?  So wrong on so many levels.I digress. On to the enchiladas.  I have always used American cheese in my ‘chiladas.  However the powers that be at Kraft decided that they didn’t need to manufacture their blocks of cheese anymore, just slices.  Well, trying to grate it was beyond frustrating.  Out came the food processor.  After I finally remembered how to use it it didn’t work well and what cheese did grate was really just little balls.  I googled what to do and read a blog entry by a woman having the same problem who just chopped it up finely.  That worked and then I chopped the onion and mixed it all together.  I have decided that American cheese is not my fav and will be exploring other options.Then I set about making the enchilada sauce which was pretty much what I always made before except for a couple of changes.  This recipe called for a pinch of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. oregano and a splash of vinegar. I never put those ingredients in my sauce before and I won’t again because it added nothing.  The sauce went together well and simmered nicely while I prepped the tortillas.I softened the tortillas in hot oil, rolled them up with the cheese filling, topped them with the sauce and remainder of the cheese mixture and popped them in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes.And there you go! I plated them, sat us down to dinner and now comes the confusion part.  I looked at the clock and it was 4:45.  In the afternoon.  Dinner was done, most of the dishes washed and it was 4:45.  I have no idea why I made dinner that early. Honestly I wasn’t even aware of the time at all.  I guess it has been so gray and icky that it seemed late.And now the funny part.  After fussing about not having the cumin my husband walked in and handed me a brand new bottle sitting on the shelf right in front of me.  Ok, maybe it wasn’t THAT funny!"},

I have to do laundry and I am going to try a new enchilada sauce recipe.   BIG plans for tomorrow.  I might even bake!  Whoa, hold on cowgirl, don’t be going all crazy!I think I need to hit the sack.  Somebody is shooting off fireworks, I suppose in celebration of the snow but it is upsetting the dog so I guess it is time to call it a day.Have a good night!"},

And a wooden carousel horse.  I can’t take a photo of it, however, it is up too high.  Most of my decor has sentimental value.  The things I have around me are things that mean something to me, that remind me of fun times and special people.  So, here we go.Here is the big, fat bluebird of happiness.  He makes me happy.  I can’t remember where I got him. Maybe Pier One.This is a painting done by my mother in lawThis clock was a gift from my mother in law in about 1990. I inherited the plates from her as well.Another painting by mother in lawThese are pictures of New Orleans that are mounted on slate tiles from Pennsylvania.  They were purchased by my husband on a work trip to New Orleans.And, for your viewing pleasure, one of my new chenille bedspreads.  I love them.  Old fashioned and comfy.So, those are those are some of the things that make up my sort of cozy."},

C.  The only thing I am going to say about it is that is embarrassing and uncalled for.  Enough said.I was asked to share some photos of some of the things I have put back into service in my home decor so here we go.One time I had an antique chest of drawers sitting in a hallway and it was a dark area.  Since there was a base plug there. I asked my husband to make me some sort of a cute, little unique lamp.  So off to the hardware store he went and he came home with a little blue speckled enameled coffee pot and in short order it was a lamp.  It has been painted many colors over the years and I finally decided to pack it away.  Now....it is back on a bookcase lighting up a dark area.  I still like it.The planters are two that I made in a ceramics group at church.  They remind me of a good time with good friends.  We would buy the items in the greenware state, clean them in class and then my friend would take them to be fired.  Then we would glaze, fire again and voila!  I loved it, would like to do it again, in fact, because it was a great way for a person with no artistic talent to be artistic.  They had been put away for a good while but I decided I needed something else to take care of so houseplants became a thing again.  One is real and one is not and one looks a lot better than the other! I hope I take care of my people better than I do my plants!So, that is just a couple of things that are now back in my house.  Tomorrow I will share my chenille bedspreads!"},
{"title": "Cottage core ", "date": "Monday, January 04, 2021", "text": "One of the ways I procrastinate the best is by looking at YouTube videos on houses and decor and cozy living.  Recently I ran across an concept called cottage core while looking at hygge and lagom articles.  I had never heard of cottage core before.iBy now we all have heard of the Scandinavian lifestyle that involve minimalism, fairy lights, candles and hot cocoa.  Sounds yummy.  I can’t do the minimalism part, mostly because my husband won’t let me toss all the furniture and buy new Danish modern stuff and the dog doesn’t play nice with fur like pillows and throws.So, I moved on to Lagom which generally means “ just enough”—not minimal but not hoarder.  I seemed to fit into this ideal better.But then came cottage core.  It is the ideal of rural life, cute cottages, chintz, tea — in tea cups and all things cozy.  This is a little more than I can handle because, well, I don’t like to dust. The blogs and photos are so relaxing, though, you risk falling into a coma looking at them.So, I started thinking about all the things I had packed away in the quest for a more minimal home and I started pulling things out and wondering why I decided minimalism was  “me”.  Then I remembered the dust.  And started putting things back.So, I have come up with what I call Melissacore.  And I follow the guidelines of  Coco Chanel when she says after you finish dressing for an event, take off the last piece of jewelry you put on and the it will be perfect.  So I am using my “things” that I have collected over almost 50 years and the last Knick knack I put out—well I put it away for another switch out.  That way, it is perfectly Melissacore.  It was a beautiful day  here.  It was sunny, in the sixties and just lovely.   I hope we have a repeat tomorrow!"},

Hopefully tonight will be better.Clearly I didn’t get much accomplished today but self care was necessary.  I did make a good start on putting away the holiday decor.  Not finished but it won’t take much to get it done.  Packing up the Christmas village is my husbands job!I did spend some time this evening working on an introduction I have been asked to write for a friend looking to publish a book. Slightly terrifying since I haven’t written anything of any merit in years and years.  But, I got a start on it and it was fun.  I do like writing,I have three books going right now — “Wildwood” by Colin Melody, “Something About The Stars” by Katherine E. Smith and “The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek”, author slipped my mind at the moment.  I don’t usually read more than one book at a time but they are all so different that I am not having difficulty with reading them all at the same time.I am reconsidering reading on a device so much.  I love my Kindle and my iPad with the nook and kindle apps but there is something about being able to see how far you actually are in the book.  I don’t know, I don’t know which is best.  Reading on a device is a lot easier if I want to read in bed and not disturb my husband.  Pros and cons.....hmmmm.School  starts back tomorrow for my daughter but not until Tuesday for Bean.  It appears that her whole 5th grade is going to be accomplished from her bedroom!  How different this year has been. For her it really hasn’t been bad, different but not bad.  Hopefully the plague will find its way out of our lives soon.So far we haven’t had much winter but the last few days have been really chilly.  Hopefully this week is going to be lovely.  They promised.  We will see. So, on that note I think it is time for me to call it a day.  I  need to recapture all the sleep I missed last night.  Have a lovely evening all and hoping for a great tomorrow!i"},

{"title": "Insomnia", "date": "Sunday, December 06, 2020", "text": "Some years ago, around 1990, I began to experience raging insomnia.  I blamed it on the stress of a major move, parents in declining health, teenagers and my age of 40 years.  Lots going on that year.  As time went on things seemed to right themselves somewhat or I just quit fighting it or whatever but things got better and the situation disappeared.Fast forward to now and the demon is rearing its ugly head once again.  Since none of the previous issues exist anymore I have been thinking about what the culprit could be.  So I did a little thinking and a little reading — funny I should mention reading—and I have come to a couple of conclusions.  I needed a designated bedtime routine.  So I put pen to paper and planned out my time from 7 to 9 pm.  I am a morning person so I am not particularly active during the evening so I figured it was just a matter of adding in some relaxation elements.  These included a nice warm shower which I don’t usually like. I like morning showers to help loosen up the ol ’ joints. However I decided to reverse the process thinking the warmth might help the pain at night. I would also add some sort of pain reliever as well. Ok, with that all done I figured I would dive into my skin care routine which I really enjoy, complete the requisite dental regimine , put on warm jammies and head out in the back with Trixie for our last foray into the bleak wilderness of the backyard. Who knows, maybe the giant orange cat would be visiting, or the quick red fox that apparently lives under our deck.  With all that done I spend a bit of time playing Animal Crossing which I have been doing most of the day between laundry loads and I grab my kindle to do a little more reading right after I check my email.Light bulb moment.After a quick google search I learned that screens should be shut down two hours before bed to reduce any interruption in sleep because all that light can mess with your mind.  Well, isn’t that dandy!  I read on my kindle before I turn out the light.  Poo.So I shut everything gown, grabbed a physical a  book and did my evening read.  The Trixster and I went to bed and while I did have trouble falling asleep, once there I didn’t have a problem staying asleep.And I didn’t dream about being a resident on my Animal Crossing island.  Has anybody else had a problem with screens and sleep?"},

There are entanglements and complications but it all works out in the end.  It seems that now in her 30’s Alice is having a hard time growing up. The third book leaves you with a cliff hanger which I thought was a bit disappointing because her relationship with Sam was just presumed and not tied up in a neat little package.There is a reason.  I found out today there are two more books in the series.  I love series but I thought I was done.  Guess not.I recommend.  Is anybody else having trouble with blogger?"},

{"title": "Signs", "date": "Friday, November 20, 2020", "text": "In 1971 there was a popular song by the Five Man Electric Band Called “Signs”.  It was all about signs in our lives telling us what to do and what not to do, generally directing our lives.  It was a very popular song but never one of my favs.Growing up in a family that possessed a fair amount of superstition, I was always aware of other kinds of signs, not the street variety.  My grandmother was superstitious and we owed it to her Native American ancestry even though she was never really around her Native American grandmother that I know of.  However, she had a healthy respect for birds—especially birds in the house.  I am sorry to say I perpetuate that belief that a bird in the house could mean death.  I don’t want to talk about it.We all know about cardinals in the yard signifying the visit of one of our dearly departed loved ones.  A feather in your path could be the same.  Those are a couple of my favorites.I don’t go out of my way looking for “signs” but in the last week I have had two things happen that have gotten my attention.I am a big believer in prayer.  I do a lot of it.  Lately I have been praying a lot for a specific intention that is dear to my heart.  In addition, I am praying for a young woman at our church who is very ill and has a young family. I never ask for signs that my prayers are heard, I know they are.  I have a very large, probably old oak tree in my yard that has to have dumped a ton of leaves in the yard.  I also have a very fuzzy dog that works hard to bring as many of those leaves into the house as possible. So, the other evening, while focusing on my prayer intention, I decided to get something warm to drink and as I headed to the kitchen something caught my eye.  There, alone, separated from the rest of the leaves that had found their way in was this.Yes, it is a cross shaped leaf.  It looks like a leaf but on my floor it looked like a golden cross.  It glowed.  It definitely caught my attention.  It made me smile.  I didn’t ask for a sign but there it was.Then I was reading a Facebook post written by Lorna Byrne.  She is an Irish mystic that can see angels.  Not just her angels but all angels.  I have always believed in guardian angels — you know— “angel of God my guardian dear...” but I have never sat down and thought about it too much until I read Byrne’s book some years ago.  I thought at the time how  blessed she is, what a fantastic gift to have.  Then, the other day I started wondering about my own angel and how neat it would be to  see him/her or at least feel his/her presence. Now, bear in mind that I was cleaning my kitchen while all this thinking and wondering was going on.  I have sort of an open shelf, like a small counter top, above my sink.  When my mother in law passed I brought home several little, tiny knick knacks  from  her apartment and set them there.  They were little things like a 90 year old woman would collect.  One of them was a terra-cotta angel, thimble sized. I had forgotten all about this little angel as it had gotten shoved under some Girl Scout badges and mangled dog toys sitting on this shelf but this day I noticed that it was laying on its side toward the front of the shelf.  I didn’t put it there.  I am sure I disturbed it when I was throwing some stuff away but I was really surprised to see it at that place at that time when I was thinking  so hard about my guardian angel. Was it a sign? Don’t know but it made me smile for sure.So, how do you feel about signs? Do you believe in them? Need them to validate beliefs? Think it is all a bunch of hooey?  I don’t know but I think I will keep the little terra-cotta angel on the shelf—she makes me smile."},

Now, in all fairness to me, I didn’t buy them myself, I fell heir to two of them but still.We have a lovely charity shop not far away that I am going to gift with all sorts of notions and things.  I am sure someone will need some pinking shears.  And rick rack, and patterns.  Lots of patterns.  I think it is time I go through the fabric too.  That will be a chore but I am feeling that it is the right time to pare down — or mass produce some bed quilts!So, as I turn out the light on this last day of my favorite month in my favorite season I am looking forward to working on this project and sharing all my excess with other who don’t have any.  It will be a win win for everybody! Now it is time to take the fur baby to bed — I will just ignore the clock until morning.  Maybe I will actually get that hour of sleep back!"},
{"title": "End of October", "date": "Friday, October 30, 2020", "text": "The end of October is rather disturbing.  Let’s review — this weekend we move the clocks back, we have a full moon and it is Halloween.  What could go wrong?On a personal level things are just frustrating. I feel like all I do is whine.  I used to be very involved in crafting and fiber arts.  I love art — can’t draw a straight line with a ruler but I love art.  My dabbling in the arts has always been in the form of quilting or embroidery and more recently, cardmaking.In May, when I broke my wrist I was told I would be able to regain about 80% of the use of my hand and I would be able to do MOST of the things I was used to doing.  That sounds promising but the reality is far different that you would think.Thanks to the pandemic I have not gone out of my house for much of anything.  Oh, I have made a couple of runs to the grocery store and doctor appointments, of course.  But, in regards to just hitting Target and stocking up on things, like greeting cards and wrapping paper and such, well, it just hasn’t happened.I needed Halloween cards for the kiddos.  So, I just decided to make them.  It has been almost a year since I have made cards.  Most of my supplies have either been used up or are aging rapidly.  I didn’t know if I even had enough supplies to cobble together four cards.  So, upstairs I bound (ok, gross exaggeration) and I set about making some cards.  My creative mojo is clearly gone but I forged ahead.  I managed to come up with four rather simple cards but my hand got stiffer and stiffer and now it is swollen and just hurts.Over the years, I have given up quilting because of arthritic hands and knees.  Now I guess I will have to give up card making.  I am going to try to do some cross stitch but I am not very confident that I will be able to .  If I can’t do that I am going to get rid of all my supplies and just read.I don’t really understand why breaking my wrist has hurt my hand so bad.  I understand my wrist hurting but I don’t understand my hand swelling and hurting.  I  as told that it was a very bad break and that I have extensive and severe arthritis in that hand but it never hurt like this before.  Whatever is going on is making me very sad.I am tired of being home, I would love to go to a bookstore or out to eat, I feel pretty shut in and now I can’t enjoy the things I like to do.  And it is going to be a full moon and Halloween.  What could go wrong?"},

I believe my sewing will be reduced to placemats and pot holders and the majority of it will involve a tapestry needle and fabric in a hoop.  I don’t like the mess, I don’t like pins and little pieces of fabric all over the floor, I don’t like big gobs of thread all over the place and I most especially don’t like sewing through my finger — this isn’t the first time.  I am just blaming it on 2020 — not that I am a lousy seamstress or impatient or genuinely disinterested — it is just 2020."},

Petite Cottons. It is a single thread with the same weight and thickness as two strands of the floss.  There are solids and blended colors and I would love, LOVE to buy the whole set.  I might.  Kinda pricey.  But, we are still pretty much quarantined so.....I have been reading a lot.  I just finished a great little read called “Summer of ‘69” by Elin Hildebrand.  It takes place on Nantucket and is the story of the  Foley/Whalen/Levin family.  It is very readable and I completely recommend.  Since it is still very much summer here, sitting and reading in the nice air conditioning is the best thing to do.  I might even turn the a/c up, grab a blanket, light some candles and do pretend hygge.  Hey, why not, this is 2020 and everything is weird!Other than that, I have been doing nothing but hand exercises, taking the dog outside and unpacking moving boxes.  Yes, we moved 3 years ago.  Yes, I am still unpacking.  I can’t talk about it."},

I could still just kick myself for having taken the fall but it could have been worse.  Counting my blessings as I do the prescribed exercises.I have been spending my time playing Animal Crossing and reading.  I finished “The Dutch House” and I highly recommend it.  I am now reading “Wildwood” and Bean and I are reading “The Chronicles of Narnia”.  We just started on the first book but I think we are going to enjoy it. And I am re-watching “The Last Tango in Halifax”.  Enjoying it a second time, just as much as the first.The schools here are in a huge mess and it is causing my daughter issues.  I am praying they go 100% remote but doubtful they will.  I think they should just cancel the year and start over again next year.  I also think somebody should create a covid test for all of us to use at home, like diabetic testing, so we could just test ourselves.  I don’t know, the whole thing is disturbing and now I am wearing masks in my house when Bean is here because she has gone back to dance class in person and kids can be  so gooey and germy.  So, here we are.  It isn’t fun, it is uncomfortable and unwelcoming and I don’t really see how kids are going to get a good education under these circumstances.  Jumping off my soap box now.Ok, hand is beginning to ache so I will say goodnight.  Goodnight!"},

{"title": "Learning New Things in the Time of Covid", "date": "Friday, May 22, 2020", "text": "A lot of people have had a very hard time with this pandemic.  In the beginning, I was pretty afraid.  The hubs and I fall into a high risk group and everything just seemed so dismal.  It did, thanks to the media mostly, seem like a disaster of epic proportion and, for a lot of people, it has been — especially those who have experienced the loss of a loved one or who contracted the disease and have had to deal with the recovery. I decided early on that I was going to comply with the restrictions without complaint.  I was going to do what I needed to do to keep well and help keep others well.  I made masks and watched the news until I decided THAT was not helpful.  Everything on the tv was negative and depressing and really frightening.  So, I decided to turn that around.I decided I wouldn’t let this make me crazy — I have one foot in crazy as it is — haha!  I didn’t need help from a virus.  So, I decided to make some changes in my life.  I didn’t know how it was going to work — it was a work in progress — and it still is but there were some things that I just needed to fix, even before this disruption in daily life.   I seem to be in a state of being overwhelmed a lot of the time — too much to do, don’t know where to start, have no energy to tackle things, no time to do the things I WANTED to do. I was not happy, it had to change and it has. I am still working on it. Tweaking so to speak — not to be confused with twerking — I couldn’t do that if my life depended on it and I have no desire to try. My husband has really bad diabetes.  We went to a diabetic counselor and adjusted his diet and he has been doing exceptionally well — his numbers have been outstanding.  So, I knew that we would be eating in now since we were quarantined so I made an effort to replicate that restaurant meals that we have learned he can eat.  I don’t like to cook but I knew I was going to have to so I made a plan — an eating plan so to speak.  Several days of the week are assigned a type of meal — for instance, Wednesday is Mexican food because growing up in San Antonio we had Mexican food in the school cafeteria every Wednesday and it was just something we always did.  On Fridays we are having breakfast for dinner because I have Girl Scouts on Friday evening and breakfast is quick.  One night a week is assigned fish, another hamburgers, so on and so forth.  It makes it so much easier.  Except for Wednesday and Friday I don’t hold to a special day for each meal but have the items on hand to make whichever meal sounds good that night.  And yes, I am building a pantry again.  I haven’t done that since my kids left home but I think that giving up on those habits was a mistake so I started rebuilding my stores before this pandemic started.  I don’t know why I felt like I didn’t need stuff just because I didn’t have kids here.I am also learning to groom the dog.  Of course the groomers weren’t considered “essential” so they were closed.  I tried trimming Trixie with scissors and it worked sort of but she needed more.  I finally broke down and bought some grooming shears and some clippers which sort of scared me to death.  The came, finally, on the day I got the text that the groomer had re-opened.  Well, I wasn’t going to send them back so I decided to give it a go.  It is going to take several goes to get her like I want her but I have to say I am pleased.  She seemed like she loved it.  Yesterday I messed with cleaning up the hair on her ears.  I figured if she would let me do her ears she would let me do all of her.  And she was great.  They were still a little raggedy but I worked on them more today.  Then I took to shearing her body.  My goodness this little dog has a lot of hair.  She looks like a little bear.  So, we spent about an hour on it.  You can tell she has been to a groomer because she knew what to do, when to stand up and she didn’t get rattled.  She still isn’t as short as I want her to be so we will have another go tomorrow.  Saturday morning is going to be her bath day.  Yorkies can tolerate getting bathed once a week so that is her new schedule.And yes, that is my ugly foot.  She is still pretty shaggy but I used the longest comb in the kit so tomorrow I will use a shorter one.  At least now she will hold her ears up.I have also learned a lot about laundry and doing dishes.  I do the completely wrong thing for the planet but I am doing the completely right thing for my sanity.  I am washing small loads every day.  I don’t wait until everything is in the hamper to wash.  I have been much happier because nothing makes me more cross than looking at a huge basket of clean laundry needing folding.  So, Monday is sheet day with underwear.  Wednesday is towel day with underwear.  Tuesday and Thursday is everything else day and Friday is cup towel day.  What I have learned is that just because you are an empty nester it doesn’t mean you can let the laundry pile up.  Same with the dishes.  I am doing lots of dishes by hand these days as well as running the dishwasher.  It seems that hand washing is pretty quick and I never have to worry about the dishwasher being too full.  I think what is happening here is that I have figured out that if I do these things daily the chores become a lot lighter.  I know, by now you are shaking your head wondering what planet I have been living on.  Well, self discipline has never been my strong suit and I have always left things until the last minute and put things off and I have always been frustrated with domesticity.  I have finally figured it out and I have felt more accomplished which had led me to wanting to keep it up.  I have also learned to go with the flow and order groceries for pick up and order things that I need from Target and such.  And you know what, I am happier doing that.  I don’t like shopping, my knees don’t let me walk all over malls anymore and so it is just a good thing for me to be able to order what I need, get free shipping where I can and I am not fighting it.  I have had zero problems with it and it makes me happy for other people to choose my groceries.  I am fine with it.  I want to plant some bulbs in the back yard at some point so I guess I will be perusing seed catalogues as well.  I have never done that and it sounds like fun.  I am hoping for some nice irises and day lillies and maybe some daffodils to celebrate St. David’s Day next year.  I have learned that the housework is never going to be finished and the only way to deal with it is to do a little each day, work in the fun stuff so you don’t feel deprived, and just keep on keeping on.  I will honestly say I have much more energy after living like this for a couple of months and I intend to keep it up.  And maybe I will get all those unfinished cross stitch projects done!"},
{"title": "Planning Your Life", "date": "Saturday, May 16, 2020", "text": "Do you use a planner?  I have always used some sort of planner because I have never been able to commit everything in my life to memory for instant recall.  When I was a kid they used to give out small Hallmark calendars at gift stores, at the check out, free for the taking.  I always had one — or maybe two — in my purse. When I was in school I used a notebook for school work, obviously, and each section had a page that I would jot down assignments, due dates, etc.  I didn’t use a separate planner because I just wasn’t that organized and if I had it in that notebook, I was good.  If I didn’t have it in that notebook chances are it got left at home.After my school years I sort of quit using a planner I could carry around and moved on to a wall calendar to keep all those “kid” things organized — two kids definitely tested my memory for sure —  I couldn’t remember what I ate the day before much less keeping all those pediatrician appointments and school schedules straight.Then my husband took to traveling and I had to keep up with his schedule and keep important contacts with me and blah blah blah I went back to a personal planner.Over the years I have used many different brands, sizes, colors, configuration ..... none of them perfect.  Right now I am using an Erin Condrin life planner that is 18 months long — or 18 months BIG.  It is big.  And I make it bigger what with papers paper clipped in it and appointment cards and such.  I keep it together with this cute rose gold elastic band and it works but it isn’t ideal.  Why you might ask?  Well......We have a book, a black book, that we keep our accounts and passwords in.  I bought it at Barnes and Noble.   My husband has decided I need my own book because it seems we can’t both use the same book because he always has it and I can never find it.  I don’t want to buy another book because that is just one more thing for me to keep up with.  I also need to have a place to put contacts in — I have a small moleskin address book, black, that keeps getting lost as well.  So, the solution would be to have contacts in my planner.  There is no place for contacts in this planner.  So, basically, I would have to re-write everything every year when I got a new planner.  I am not up for that. I have even tried to download a digital planner and that just didn’t work at all — clearly I am not techy enough.So, the solution is to make my own.  I have made my own using a moleskin journal before and it was good and fit in my purse but again,  being bound, it couldn’t be added to at all.  The obvious solution is a binder — but what size?  I have explored half size binders, leather binders, cute binders, regular binders.....And after watching several videos I was no closer to making a decision.  So, I decided to shop my own desk.  I have a half page loose leaf binder, I have a silly full size binder that is new and never used and I have two zipper binders.  One is a pink and black binder that I bought somewhere, can’t remember where and the other is this really cute, sort of hippie retro floral print, bright pink, that I got years ago at Old Navy.  I had no use for it when I bought it but I really like the print.  So, off the shelf it came.When I opened it up it had two or three sets of dividers — nothing “cute” but all very serviceable.  One set was for the months of the year and then I had two sets of insertable dividers — plain ol’ buff colored.  There was also a very nice pencil pouch there and a pocket that I could stash a dashboard with post its and paper clips and such and a couple of other little hidey holes for things.  I don’t actually remember putting all that stuff in there but I was glad to see it.  Now, clearly this is a large item to haul around.  I don’t have my junior high school boyfriend to “carry my books” for me and I doubt my husband is going to haul it around.  So, what do I do when I go to appointments and things?  After some thought I decided the best thing to do is employ the calendar on my phone.  Then transfer any appointments or plans to the planner.  The thing is, I don’t want to possibly lose the planner with my contact list and, even more importantly I don’t want to lose my account and password information so the planner would have to stay home for the most part.  I did some looking online for free printable and printed out monthly calendars.  I don’t have a color printer so everything I printed is just black and white but I am thinking of ways to bling it out.  I printed out the half page versions but the more I look at it the less workable I think it is.  After using Erin Condrin and the MochiThings planners, I know I need room to write.  So, is this going to be my Holy Grail of a planner?  Doubtful but we will see.  I am going to give it a go.  I figure this way, at least it is a bright color so I won’t lose it in the jumble of “black” books we have around here and it zips so things won’t fall out.  It is bulky and it is bigger than the current planner but it does have some pluses.  What do you use?  How do you use it?  Opinions?  Discuss."},

I get really cranky if I can’t do my fun stuff and I was raised to do the important stuff first so I have devised a way to do them both.  I am stitching or reading between laundry loads or emptying the dishwasher.  I am alternating a chore with fun.  It is working well.  Plus, I am looking at the things I have been putting off and figuring out how I can get it done really quickly.  So far so good.  I am not terribly domesticated and really don’t care for housework so this sort of makes it better.

We are book people so books always come home with us when we travel.  My husband had been to New Orleans years ago and brought home some books on the area so I chose something different than the usual factual travel type books.The book that is going the wrong way “Fragile Grounds” is a book about the historical and unique cemeteries in NOLA.  Being below sea level poses a distinct problem for people living in the area that want to remain in the area after they have gone to the great beyond.  Here in Texas burials are pretty straightforward and run of the mill — you open the grave, place the casket or urn, and cover it up.  Not a lot of fuss unless your cemetery is on rocky terrain like our family cemetery in Harper, Texas and then dynamite is involved but for the most part there is little complication.  New Orleans isn’t quite that way — all the graves are above ground or they sink into the ocean.  There are many of these little tombs for families or strangers or both.  There is a process.  It is gross.  I won’t go into it here.  If you are curious do a google search.  I am glad I live in Texas.The second book is a paperback called “The Last Madam” about the life of French Quarter legend Norma Wallace.  It is the portrait of a time in New Orleans French Quarter that is full of charm and decadence.  It is a non-fiction read but I am hoping it is interesting and historical — I loved it there and I would like to know more about it although I am not particularly interested in bordellos.  Or tombs either, actually, but the whole place just smacks of glamour and a bit on the wild side.  I took a photo but it didn’t actually turn out probably because the dog was trying to be involved in the picture taking.Aunt Sally’s  Creole Praline Shop was a delight in itself.  I bought the books there as well as the little prints I showed in a previous post.  It was full of pictures, pottery, books, souvenir pencils, magnets, Mardi Gras beads and, of course, pralines.  I grew up eating pralines that were commonly sold in Mexican restaurants and I wanted one so badly but it seems that in my senior years I have developed an allergy to pecans so I didn’t get one.  I wanted one though.  But, I was already having enough trouble walking I certainly didn’t want to end up with an allergic reaction!So, that is the most of the souvenirs.  I have one more to show at a later date but it is small and rather inconsequential.  I am now off to my little space at the table to work on my cross stitch.  Opps, I did say AFTER the chores, didn’t I?  My bad."},
{"title": "Mother’s, Owls, Cross stitch and Baking", "date": "Monday, May 11, 2020", "text": "Happy Belated Mother’s Day to all.  Mother’s Day is bittersweet to me.  While I am a mother it takes a backseat to me missing my own mother.  My mother passed away in 1996, she was only 3 years older than I am right now — certainly brings perspective to age — and I think I miss her more rather than less as the years go on. And while I could wallow in grief for a long time I choose to focus on my own Mother’s Day.  I have two wonderful children — a boy and a girl.  They aren’t children, clearly anymore, and they have children of their own who are growing quickly — we even have one teenager! Yikes!  In this difficult time, though, they managed to make my Mother’s Day probably the best I have ever had.  Saturday evening the doorbell rang and there was my son and family standing by the car — they had brought me a photo and a card made by the kids.  I just love these sorts of gifts — they mean so much because they come from the heart and the hands of those giving them.  My daughter called and said she wanted to bring us dinner.  Now, my poor daughter has been having to listen to me grouse about being tired of eating my own cooking so she and her family went to a popular barbecue place and brought us dinner.  She knew how welcome this gesture would be.  It was wonderful.  They were both so thoughtful and came through even though this Covid thing is definitely making things more — challenging.  I have really good kids.  I am blessed.We are also blessed with an owl.  About a month ago I was outdoors at dusk with the Chunky Monkey (aka Trixie) and I heard this wild flapping of wings and watched an owl swoop down very close to her.  Now, bear in mind that I am a total city girl and having owls dive bomb the dog isn’t something I am used to.  Since the dog is like twice as big as the owl I guess it thought better of trying to grab her up and rested in the tree above where we were standing.  I have never seen the owl again but I did find an owl pellet in the yard which was an exciting thing for Trixie to try to get ahold of.  So, since the owl is clearly still around I might get Hubs to build an owl house for it. I don’t know too much about owls so research is in order.I am still working on my cross stitch project and making a bit of progress.  At least I am past the beige on beige bit — green on beige is a little easier to do!  I am going to work on it today in between laundry and vacuuming up all the leaves the Chunky Monkey brings in.  My life has sort of morphed into a weird little routine not of my design.  I have the cross stitch on the kitchen table and every time I put a load of laundry in or load the dishwasher I sit down and do a few stitches.  The book I am STILL reading — The Little Shop of Found Things — is there as well so sometimes I sit and read a couple of pages between doing the laundry or the dishes or taking cookies out of the oven which brings me to my newest activity — baking.I used to bake a LOT.  Bread, cookies, muffins — but we also ATE a lot and none of it was good for Hubs diabetes so I sort of put it on the back burner so to speak — no pun intended.  You know how they say don’t grocery shop when you are hungry?  Well, that goes for ordering groceries as well — one of my orders had a copious amount of cookies in it and I ate them.  Not good.  Really not good.  So, I decided that any sweets I might have I will make myself.  So, the other day I pulled out the mixer and the measuring cups and mixed up some chocolate chip cookie dough.  I usually drop them with a little scoop like an ice cream scoop but I found it made my hands hurt so I went back to the double spoon method.  I got a new cookie sheet for Christmas that is ridged for even cooking and I hadn’t used it yet so I pulled it out and I can’t tell you what great cookies it made.  They were crisp on the outside and soft in the middle — really nice — so I am pleased with that.  My husband also bought me some cookie stamps and an etched rolling pin to make elaborate cookies with and I am going to try those out — I think you have to use a springerle recipe for those.  When I do I will add photos but I didn’t think to take photos of the plain ol’ chocolate chip cookies.  So, anyway, I am back into baking and most of it is going into the freezer but better the freezer than me!  You have heard of the Freshman 15?  Well, I don’t want to fall victim to the Covid 25!My knee has been giving me a lot of trouble lately so I think today I am going to try riding my exercise bike some.  I know it will help but self discipline isn’t my strong suit.  But, I have the time so......no excuses.With that, I think I will go get some laundry done.  I am finding life to be much easier if I do things in smaller batches and more often — I really hate large loads of laundry — and dishwashing — not waiting until so many things need to be washed — do it and get it done.  My younger self could have learned so much from my old lady self.  Eye roll."},
{"title": "Sunday Ramblings", "date": "Sunday, May 03, 2020", "text": "It is May 3.  I thought it was May 2.  I DO know it is Sunday.  The beginning of a new week and the beginning of a new grocery list for curbside pickup.How are you doing during this time?  I am a little frustrated.  Not because I am at home — I LIKE being at home.  I have all I need and I have the ability to get what I need.  What I am frustrated about is time — I figured I would have all this time to do things and I do but my gimpy knees are giving me trouble so I am sitting way too much and not doing all I need to do.  I am going to try to deal with that mindfully today.  I might have to make a list instead of just wandering around with no real plan.  Lists are good.I have been doing some thinking about streamlining things around here.  Minimalizing if you will.  I don’t know about you but as I am getting, ahem, older, certain things annoy me.  Purses for instance.  I really could do without carrying a purse.  Keys.  I can’t tell you how many times I leave the house without my keys.  If I am with Hubs it is ok, I don’t need them but sometimes I do and they are a pain.  If I throw them in the purse they always sink to the bottom and I can’t find them.  So, as I laid there last night trying to fall asleep, I was trying to figure out how to eliminate the problem.  Voila, so simple, just put the keys in your wallet.  I only have two keys and a key fob for the car so take them off the key ring and put them in a zipper section of my wallet.  Then I always have them. And I put all my stuff in a clutch type wallet so if I don’t want to carry a purse I don’t have to.  I find purses to be so bulky and in the way, especially cross bodies and walking with a cane is a lot more difficult if you are trying to carry a handbag.  I had a lot of trouble in New Orleans trying to wangle a rather large crossbody and a cane and shopping bags — there was no room for a drink!First world problem.  Not earth shattering or really insurmountable but right now little aggravations seem amplified.I finally jumped on the baking bandwagon.  I have to be careful because my diabetic husband loves baked goods but yesterday I had a bunch of bananas that needed to be used so I made two recipes of banana muffins and sent some home with the Bean.  I think I am going to freeze the remaining, very ripe bananas.  I will see how that goes.I am watching lots of tv — too much tv — which only adds to the problem of too much sitting.  I am attending church on my ipad.  Our clergy has made May 17 a target date for reopening for Mass but I don’t imagine we will be going anytime soon.  Hubs is vulnerable.  He is 73 and diabetic and heart issues. I have some underlying issues as well but not like his so I think we will be doing things this way for a while.I have been trying to read but I keep not doing it.  I am still reading “The Little Shop of Found Things” and am about half done.  I need to make a plan for getting it done because I have another in the queue that I am anxious to start — “The Dutch House”.  Maybe I should put reading on my “to-do” list.I am still working on my cross stitch project.  I am “building” St. Louis Cathedral in NOLA.  It is coming along but I ran out of one of the threads so I had to order it from an online cross stitch shop.  It took forever to come so I got impatient and placed a curbside pickup at my neighborhood Michaels.  And....wait for it....the ordered thread arrived the next day so I have a bumper crop of beige thread.  Sigh.Apparently the thing to do on some of the cross stitch groups on FB is to show the back of the work.  I try to make the back of my work neat, I end threads at the end of a color or a row and I don’t drag threads across large areas.  It is fun looking at peoples approach — some are as good as the fronts and some are just hot messes. Here is my back—Not perfect, but not terribly shabby.  We will see how it goes because there is a large area of greenery and lots of one or two stitches of a color and then a change.  That should mess it up nicely.  We will see.So, that is today.  I need to trim the Trixie monster’s nails — not sure how I feel about that.  I don’t want to have to go to the emergency room but her nails are really treacherous now.  And I am needing to cut her bangs because I can’t see her eyes anymore.  Clipping her face is sort of dangerous because she doesn’t sit still and I can just see me taking an eye out.  Thinking about buying a product called Scaredy Cut — it is scissors with clipper heads on it — looks fairly benign — ha!  I will let you know.So, have a wonderful, quiet, safe Sunday!"},
{"title": "Am I Clever or What?", "date": "Friday, April 24, 2020", "text": "I used to cross stitch all the time.  Then I quilted all the time.  Then I baked all the time.  Then I made cards all the time.  What goes around comes around, right?So, now I am cross stitching again.I am working on a chart of St. Louis Cathedral on Jackson Square in New Orleans, Louisiana.  I bought the chart at a cute little needlework shop in the French Quarter.  I am enjoying working on it except for the thread deficit which has been shipped now and will be here soon.  And, I decided to work it on Carolina linen Aida which is a speckled beige fabric. This is where the clever part comes in and I am being sarcastic.The fabric is beige.  The threads are various shades of beige, except for what is green.  It is 14 count which isn’t too bad but after just a few rows it has sort of all become beige.  Lots of beige.I might go blind.But it isn’t nearly as bad as stitching on black. Anyway, here it is so farIt isn’t a big chart and I would have been done had I not run out of thread.  However, tomorrow I am going to work around the missing threads and continue with the beige.  I think it is going to be cute even if it is a bit.......beige.Anyway, I will give an update as I progress.  I also found several unfinished projects that are going to give me grief — you know, must finish before I can start anything new.  I hate that about myself.  But, anyway, I hope to get this one done quickly so I can add it to my collection."},
{"title": "Shopping Online", "date": "Thursday, April 23, 2020", "text": "I almost titled this “Shopping Online in the time of Covid” but the reality is that online shopping has become the norm for me. I don’t know about anybody else but I am finding that retail shopping has changed.  In my childhood we had large department stores and, for the most part, those large stores provided one stop shopping from clothes, to fabrics, to hair products — one even sold saddles!  Going “downtown” on a Saturday (which we did every two weeks) would result in a lot of shopping— so much that many times we used a delivery service called Merchant’s Delivery (little dark blue vans) that would deliver our purchases to our homes.  We never had a problem finding what we wanted.Fast forward to today.  I don’t like shopping like I used to — blame it on the mobility issues — so when I go I want to go in, get what I need, and leave.  I am finding more and more that I am having difficulty finding things — while there are things in the store, there isn’t the variety that we used to have and not necessarily the brands that I use.  So, I turn to the internet and search until I find what I want.  I was beginning to think that a lot of things I use have just been discontinued but that isn’t the case — they are just not available in stores.  I understand that stores don’t have “back rooms” like they used to where they kept more stock — there is no more stock — what you see in the store is what is in the store — period.  It is sad and disturbing. I miss those large, glamourous department stores.  I remember the smell when we would walk into the air conditioning from the hot street.  Many times we entered the store through the small leather goods department, where my aunt worked, and the lush smell of the leather would seem so strong.  We walked through the cosmetics and the perfume departments and those heady smells would take our breath away — sometimes almost literally.  We ate lunch in the small cafe called The Chuck Wagon because the formal dining area — The Camellia Room — was reserved for fancy things like bridesmaids luncheons and debutant brunches. Joske’s — the Biggest Store in the Biggest State until Alaska became a state then it was the Greatest Store in the Greatest state — We had to adapt!The Camellia Room — I only ate there once when I was an adult Had my hair done there several times.  My aunt worked there and  used the salon — the stylists name was Larry.  He wanted to cut my hair into a pixie.  I didn’t let him.  I was about six.But, we are living in the time of Covid and I no longer have the energy or interest to plod through stores these days.  These large department stores are a thing of the past — Neiman-Marcus is declaring bankruptcy as I type — gone are the smells and sights that invoke those wonderful childhood memories.  My blue delivery vans are now gray with a turquoise swoop that says “prime” or are brown and say UPS or maybe they are a plain truck that says nothing.  But, they bring me my goods — and now dog food and some groceries. — and they do provide a bit of excitement — like waiting for the mailman. Will things go back to the way they were before?  I doubt it.  Retail was suffering to begin with and I don’t think this situation is doing it any good. I can’t imagine the department stores are suddenly going to morph back to MY past and become something like Joske’s or Frost’s or Neiman-Marcus again.  I think that is a thing of the past, something that can’t be explained to our children — the products, the smells, the very feel of the places.  It was a thing of past generations and our grandchildren are going to reminisce about Prime trucks and browsing the internet to shop.  So sad."},
{"title": "New Attitudes in the time of Covid", "date": "Wednesday, April 22, 2020", "text": "This quarantine is inconvenient.  It is also a little comical.Years ago I went on a binge and I bought every shade of DMC thread there was — all three million colors or whatever there are.  I patiently wound all the thread on the little bobbins and put them in the cases — about 8 cases.  They looked like little jewels. Over the years I have pulled out bobbins for projects, put them in ziplocks with charts, just generally messed up my thread.When I bought the chart of St. Louis Cathedral, Jackson Square, in New Orleans the girl asked if I needed thread.  I assured her I had all of it.I don’t.I am missing four colors out of the list on the chart.  I have torn all my craft stuff apart looking for those colors.  Well, the part of my craft stuff that didn’t get torn up looking for elastic. The dog even got one of my bobbins and tore up the thread — good doggy!I found charts I love and never made, I have found new skeins of thread that never got put on bobbins, I have found embroidery scissors I forgot I had but I can’t find those four colors of thread.So, I decided to go get the thread — oh, wait, nope, can’t do that because the store is closed except for curbside pickup.  Curbside pickup — I can do that!  Well, Michael’s process is so complicated, and my items might not be eligible for pickup — I gave up and ordered it from an online store.  It will be shipped Friday.  Poo.  That means it will be Monday before it gets here, at least.  I won’t have worked on the chart for over a week and in that time I could have had it done.  It isn’t a huge chart.Annoying for sure but a small thing at this time.  We are blessed, we are healthy, our family is healthy, we have food, the ever elusive toilet paper, a roof over our heads and the good sense to stay in the house.  I have a new vision of things — I am finding humor in things that would have aggravated me at one time — like the dog and the thread.  I am putting things in perspective — like, so what that I will have to wait for the thread — such a small thing when other people are waiting for food or medicine.  I am quieter and more introspective and I am seeing beauty in lots of things around me that I had just quit noticing and it seems like my priorities have changed a lot.  I am not rushing (no where to go), I have lifted my self imposed demands on myself and therefore am actually enjoying cooking and cleaning more than I ever have — who says it all has to be done in one day — take your time, shine your sink, and enjoy the process. Who knew that at my age I would learn new things."},
{"title": "How Are Things Changing For You?", "date": "Friday, April 17, 2020", "text": "They keep talking about how life will be different when this is all over.Say, what?  Life is different NOW! I don’t know about you but while things are the same in some respects, they have changed a lot for me.  I have morphed back to my childhood.Second childhood, you might ask? Ha! No, not yet but without a doubt I have fallen back on the things of my childhood that were comfortable.  I wonder if you have as well.Food is what comes to my mind most readily.  For years now I have been trying to be more natural, more ‘green’, more non-toxic, if you will.  Less processed.  Enter pandemic and my pantry now consists of copious amounts of canned goods — not Amy’s — Green Giant.  I have cornbread mix rather than the raw ingredients to make it from scratch, cans of soup, store bought cookies, frozen breaded fish rather than the fancy schmancy ready grilled salmon from the fancy schmancy HEB store.  All of a sudden my paradigm has shifted — clearly quantity over quality.  The need to stock the freezer rather than hitting the store every two days for the freshest of the fresh.  Frozen fruit and vegetable — and — frozen garlic bread.  These are all things my mother bought, things I grew up with — grilled cheese sandwiches on white bread with soup — and I have completely gone back to my happy place.  How about you?Reading.  Reading is a great escape for me and now is no exception EXCEPT I had progressed to the new era — reading on devices.  Love them— have several — love being able to buy books at the click of a button or check out library books without the library.  But, I am having difficulty reading on the devices.  I keep going back to reading books — physical books — because I am taken back to when I was a kid and would go to the library, get a stack of books and curl up through the winter, through the thunderstorms, through the bad days at school.  I feel like I am in that chair or on that couch reading through this storm.  How about you?Hobbies.  I have dabbled in hobbies all my life, from the first set of embroidered dish towels when I was five (disaster by the way).  I have quilted, I had done paper crafts, needlepoint, regular embroidery, cross stitch, tried knitting — and I have lost interest with all of it at various times.  Now I have picked up the needle again.  Cross stitch.  Not because I have this huge desire to cross stitch images for which there is absolutely no use but because it brings back memories — like when I had pneumonia and I cross stitched a pillow top for my mother for Mother’s Day, the times I would carry small projects with me while hospital sitting with parents — it gives my hands something to do beside grab those store bought cookies.  How about you?Laundry and house work.  I am really bad at housework however, I am finding comfort in cleaning and doing laundry and “feathering the nest” so to speak.  For some reason vacuuming and dusting and decluttering and putting things in order is making me feel good.  When I was first married I kept a very simple, mid-century house and I kept it well, it was always clean (down to the baseboards) and I didn’t have a lot of clutter.  Over the years, with kids and stuff and aging and less energy things aren’t as easy as they used to be.  The house I live in is three times larger than that little first house and sometimes I dream of that little first house with it’s ONE bathroom — green and brown tiles — so much littler so much easier.  But, I am working my way through it one room at a time and it is comforting — I am putting things out that I used to have out in that first house, I am not trying to be modern and sophisticated — I am going back to my roots.  How about you?The yard.  I am not an outdoor person.  I don’t do yard work, I don’t like gardening for a variety of reasons but in the last few days I have been looking at the yard (which is quite large) and making plans.  We don’t have flower beds because neither one of us wants to maintain them, it is just a big lot with grass and a lot of trees.  I am longing for a fire pit, a swing of some sort, a few chairs around the fire pit.  A picnic table would be nice.  Family playing in the yard would be great — I hope to see that again soon.  I think about how during my childhood we spent lots of time outdoors — and I long to go out after dinner and just sit in the yard, just sitting and talking, having a cup of coffee or a soda — just enjoying the yard and the stars and the stupid June bugs.So, I guess the question at the end of all this musing is — how will things be at the end of this?  Will I go back to being a foodie, will I go back to shopping every couple of days, will I decide I don’t need to dust those baseboards and will I decide the Kindle is superior to a book?I have to idea.  I had no idea this pandemic could ever happen here.  It doesn’t seem possible, it doesn’t seem real and I can’t get my head around it.  Since I never had to deal with anything like this before, as an adult, I have no idea what the lasting effect will be.  Is this going to be our “depression”? I am sure my lifelong dislike of crowds will not change and will serve me well because I don’t imagine I will ever go anywhere full of crowds again and I will probably always have hand sanitizer with me — if I can find some!How about you?"},
{"title": "The Last Dogs — A book series", "date": "Wednesday, April 15, 2020", "text": "Caroline and I are reading a series called “The Last Dogs”.  It is four books telling the story of three dogs — Max, Rocky and Gizmo — on a quest to find their packs, their people.A while back the people disappeared.  People in hazmat suits picked them all up and took them away leaving all the pets.  Now these three — Max, Rocky and Gizmo — want to find their people so they are going through all sorts of adventures to discover what happened to them.  It has been a rough go and not much progress was made until the last few chapters of the first book — “The Vanishing”.  In “The Vanishing” we see the pups leave their town and go to the city where they encounter packs of rats, cats and wolves.  They get hurt, chased and hungry.  They learn about The Corporation and how the animals left behind are trying to cope with being on their own. The first book is exciting, cruel in places, humorous (thanks to Rocky and Gizmo) and just really leaves you wanting moreThen comes the second book — “Dark Waters” — same cast and crew and more adventures.  I won’t spoil it except for one thing —The three pups ventured to the Zoo and met The Mountain (Mortimer the Elephant) — and that is where they heard about the virus.  Apparently there was a lab — The Lab — where experiments were done on animals and the Praxis procedure was performed on the animals making them super intelligent.  The procedure involved injecting a virus into the animals and then zapping them with electricity to activate it.  Seems the virus escaped the lab, mutated and started infecting the animals and then infecting the people.  Because of that, the people evacuated and left the pets behind because even though the pets weren’t getting sick, the people were. UH, HELLO!  What a book to be reading right now! What kind of coincidence is that? We are half way through the second book and it is becoming disturbing.  Caroline is loving it and since they don’t watch a lot of news I don’t think she sees the comparison of what is happening right now. But I do.That’s all I have to say."},
{"title": "Easter Sunday Freak Out", "date": "Tuesday, April 14, 2020", "text": "Ok, this may come as a surprise to everyone but I am not a calm person.  Even in the best of times. For several days last week I had been having allergy issues.  My ears especially and my eyes were bothering me a lot.  We have at least 50-75 photinias planted in the back yard — not our doing — and they are blooming to beat the band.  We are allergic.  The wind has been blowing a lot.  I have been standing out in the yard with the dog that doesn’t want to do her business out there, she just wants to chase bugs and roll in the grass.  I knew it wasn’t a good combination.So, Easter was not quite the day we had hoped — no ham, no family, no eggs hidden, it was just blah.  So, we watched church online at 1 p.m. and then I fell asleep.  When I woke up I was having a chill, I felt awful and I had a FEVER!!!  Nothing scares me like a fever.I was so scared I even called the doctor on call for my doctor asking if I should go to the ER or get tested for the plague.  He said neither.  He said it didn’t sound like Coronavirus — no cough and not short of breath — although it could be something brewing but not that.  He said just manage the fever, he would send the report to my doctor and my doctor could decide if I needed to get tested. I have yet to hear from my doctor.I was completely terrified which probably helped the temperature climb.  I finally calmed down, the fever came down, I took some tylenol and went to bed fever free.  At some point it came back as a low grade, I didn’t feel good on Monday but the temp went away on it’s own and didn’t come back.I have stayed in all day yesterday — no doggie walkies outside — either Daddy had to take her (which isn’t a good solution) or she had to use the potty pads.  Since she does that 85% of the time I didn’t feel bad about explaining to her that I was not going out in the pollen, the wind, and the spurt of winter we have had in the last couple of days.  I am sure she understood every word.  But, the more I was in the less my ears hurt and the less my eyes were bothering me. So, I think rather than Coronavirus I was having an allergy attack.  I think the temperature was probably some inflammation and total unadulterated fear.  In any event, it seems to be gone — crossing my fingers.So, that is panic in the time of corona and I do it so well."},

I can’t draw a straight line with a ruler but I admire those who can.  I come from an artistic family although that gene clearly skipped my generation.  My own personal art comes in the form of card making, quilting, and needlework.  Right now I am involved in revitalizing my interest in cross stitch. When I travel I like to acquire certain things from the area I am visiting.  Books are a must, Christmas ornaments are highly sought after and prints depicting the area I am visiting are always a welcome addition.  Our latest trip to New Orleans was no different. So, in this time of quarantine I thought I would share some of the art I have acquired from other places and one other that is really special to me. These are prints that I obtained in New Orleans.  The one on the right is a painting of the riverboat we rode down the Mississippi.  We also ate a delicious dinner there as well.  It was a lot of fun.  Too crowded which made me worry about the virus but after dinner we sat out on the deck and relaxed as we enjoyed the Mighty Mississippi!  It was great! The one on the right is the famous St. Louis Cathedral in Jackson Square and the French Quarter.  I will go back again because I just didn’t get enough!Tower Bridge in London.  I purchased this in Covent Garden on our visit to England in 2005.This is the one that is truly special to me — it is our church.  A drawing done by Michael Pavlovsky, a well known local artist and fellow parishioner, as a fund raiser for a project.  I smile every time I look at it.  Sorry for the light shining on it.Arneson River Theater in San Antonio, Texas.  It is a unique open air theater that is used extensively through the Fiesta season for Ballet Folklorico performances.Big Ben, phone box, mail box, double decker bus — all the ‘things” of   London.   England was the one place on my bucket list and I enjoyed it immensely.That is not all the art I have in the house but I only have one piece that I bought just because I liked it.  Everything else was either a gift or done by somebody, mostly relatives.  I am funny in that things that I surround myself with have to have meaning whether the art on the wall or the jewelry on my body.  I guess I am a traditionalist and love the coziness that things give when they have meaning.  I will share other things another time — I even have a collection of Bean’s work that I would love to share.  Another post, another post."},
{"title": "What A Mess", "date": "Wednesday, April 08, 2020", "text": "What a Mess and no, I am not talking about the Coronavirus crisis although that certainly does qualify as a “mess” of epic proportions.What I am speaking of, however, is my craft area and most specifically, my craft stash.I have been making masks which forced me to go into the craft closet.  Everything is a hodge podge, clearly just thrown in with our last move almost 3 years ago.  I haven’t been doing much crafting, except for card making, so I haven’t entered the closet of doom.Ok, so I managed to locate all I needed for the masks and used up some of my stash which is good — well, it doesn’t look like a dent was made in the fabric but I did manage to use up all the elastic.  I am done with masks for a few days because, while it was fun in the beginning, it turned boring and I got a terrible backache from bending over the machine.  And then the machine had a temper tantrum which made me all tense so I made it happy, finished up and decided to move on for a few days to something else. Specifically cross stitch.Here is the little Old North Church I mentioned in an earlier post.It is leaning up again a wooden block that you can see through the fabric.  It was a lot of fun to make and it is really tiny.I am going to start on of the kits I brought home from New Orleans.  It is a chart of the St. Louis Cathedral on Jackson Square. It was such a lovely church.Of course, by that time things were beginning to be cancelled due to the plague so a concert that was supposed to happen didn’t but we got to tour the church.  Since it is such an iconic part of the French Quarter, I decided a chart of it would be an appropriate souvenir.So, I went upstairs to gather my supplies and I was really annoyed.  At one point, in my craft hoarding life, I managed to buy all the DMC threads.  All. Of. Them.  Well, I couldn’t find about half the colors.  I finally realized they were packaged in other half done kits.  So, I gathered what I could, searched other stuff that was half done and I think I have it all now but there needs to be some serious Marie Kondo -ing of my sewing stuff.  Well, else do I have to do, right?  I guess this will teach me to quit being so sloppy!Time for a nap."},

He was fighting a war with his body.  His blood sugar had dropped dangerously low.   He was almost in a coma.  He rode in an ambulance.  He recovered well and fully and we even went on to have Easter dinner that evening.This Easter finds us fighting a war with an enemy we can’t see.  We imagine it at every turn.  We are spraying and disinfecting indiscriminately to thwart the demon that is wrecking our very existence.We have been told to focus on Jesus and not the storm.  Even though Easter as we know it is cancelled, it is almost a blessing that we are going through this during the Easter season because it helps us to put the focus where it needs to be. Our bishop has asked that we hang palms, or greenery, on our doors to commemorate Palm Sunday.  I have no palms and my husband just trimmed up everything and disposed of the branches so I have no other greenery.  So, what is a paper crafter to do?  Improvise.Wishing you a wonderful and meaningful Palm Sunday!  Stay in, stay well and stay safe!"},
{"title": "Learning New Things in the Time of Pandemic", "date": "Saturday, April 04, 2020", "text": "As we forge ahead during this very odd, uncomfortable, sad, infuriating time I am learning a lot of things.  Not new hobbies or doing things I have been putting off but things of life.I am learning that being frugal is a good thing.  I am so fortunate when it comes to material things — I have never really had to worry about where my next meal is coming from or if the lights are going to stay on or if I have a roof over my head.  In the past I have been a bit wasteful — I would throw the leftovers away because my husband doesn’t like leftovers.  I always felt bad about it but did it anyway.  Now?  Uh, no.  He will be seeing those leftovers again.We don’t need nearly as much “paper” as we think we do.  A few months back I bought, on a whim, a package of 50 cheap, unhemmed microfiber towels. I can’t find a photo of them and am too lazy to get up and go take one but they are very basic with pinked edges.  I didn’t have a reason to buy them at the time but I am glad I did.  Trixie is a messy little doggy.  She is always making some kind of a mess or another and I have never been shy about pulling off a bunch of paper towels and going to town.  Now I have determined these towels to be used for those messes — and I am not using paper towels.  I am also using cup towels for more kitchen things rather than paper towels.  It is amazing how something like this changes your habits.I am learning that sleep is a good thing.  Now I haven’t gone into some sort of weird hibernation, escape thing — I don’t feel depressed or denied or frightened — but I am adhering to my usual schedule and I look forward to crawling into that bed at night and getting all cozy!  I am also getting up at the same time too and that is good.  Our meal times have stayed the same and I because of that I haven’t lost track of the days.I have learned that you can have too much of a good thing — like the news.  I only watch a little of it because I am certain that if you watch too much you will really get sick.I have learned that people are crazy.  Long story but it seems that a lot of old folks have launched into our second childhoods and it isn’t pretty.  People, get a grip.Have a great Saturday!"},
{"title": "Masks ", "date": "Thursday, April 02, 2020", "text": "According to our medical expert, Dr. Fauci,  they might be recommending the use of masks in the not so distant future.  Well, of course, in the beginning of all this they said we didn’t need masks but the masks went the way of the toilet paper and now there are none to be found.  So, the solution?  Make your own.Anybody who sews knows this is just a matter of “hold my seam ripper”, “I am quilter hear me stitch” — whatever.  So, even though I have been away from quilting for a while I never got rid of any of my supplies — and I mean any of them. So,  I went upstairs to the very unorganized closet full of unorganized sewing supplies and started rummaging.  Clearly that closet needs a good reorganizing but that is another post.  I thought I remembered having some pellon — I finally found the pellon — a whole bolt of it.  Why did I buy a bold of pellon?  I don’t remember but I am glad I did.  Then I realized I couldn’t find my quilting ruler or my rotary cutter.  I still haven’t found the ruler but I had another because I can’t just buy one of anything.  The rotary cutter has seen better days — the blade is completely rusted and I don’t know why and I can’t find the other three I once had.  So, I had to cut the fabric with scissors.  Imagine that — so totally old school.  I didn’t think I had any elastic but I found some and then I found some more every drawer I opened so I am good on the elastic front.So anyway, after “phoning a friend” — messenger actually — and doing some google searches I found a reasonable pattern with a good visual.  I used a fashion fabric (gingham), the pellon, and a backing fabric of white muslin.  I cut it all 6X9, added 6” of elastic on each end and bingo, a mask.  I have made two — the second was easier, of course.  It fits me well and I am going to make a few a tad larger for the “boys” although this one fit my husband quite well.  I think my grandkids can wear the adult ones one except for the little squirt and I will have to figure out how much smaller to make it and I might use ties on hers just to make it easier to fit her.Here is a photo of my work — I realize the pleats are crooked but this is my prototype and they aren’t crooked on the second one I made.  These are actually sort of fun and addicting to make. At least it is a cheery color considering this day is anything but cheery.Ok, that title is an exaggeration.  I know that.  It hasn’t been that long and it really hasn’t been than difficult.  I have plenty to do and plenty of craft things to play with and lots of puzzles to put together so I am good.From the first day of my self imposed quarantine — the day after we returned from New Orleans — I have maintained my regular routine.  We are retired, we had stocked up on food and goods, we don’t have a huge social life so for the most part life just went on as usual without the normal after school pick up.Then yesterday happened.  My husband wasn’t feeling well — not virus related — but allergy related.  He has been out in the yard cutting down two trees,              The pollen is high and the photinia’s are blooming which bring a bumper crop of that little allergen as well.  So, I was on high alert.  From the moment I got up everything was wrong.  Finally late afternoon I realized what was wrong....I never got dressed.  Or combed my hair.  Or put on makeup or shoes.  So, 4:30 p.m. found me in the shower trying to scrub off all the ick of the day — the bad mood, the worry, the fear — and it worked.  I cooked a favorite dinner of mine — tacos because on Wednesday, in Texas, we always had Mexican food in school and old habits die hard. We had dinner, watched a little tv, fussed at the dog and I went to bed improved but with new resolve.  Tomorrow (today) would be different.So, I woke up before the alarm this morning which was good.  Instead of just laying there mulling over our current situation I got up and reverted back to my FlyLady days.  I got dressed to the shoes — fully dressed with makeup on, hair combed and jewelry — yes, jewelry except for rings because rings are supposedly problematic when trying to keep your hands cleaned.  I am not too worried about it though since we aren’t leaving the house and nobody is coming in.  My biggest source of grief is mail and deliveries.  I am a madwoman with a can of Lysol.So, how did I do this morning?  I feel better than I did yesterday.  However getting dressed in the semi-dark when all you wear is dark clothes is a bit difficult — I have on a pair of navy LandsEnd stretchy pants (really comfy, heavy weight) and a black long t-shirt.  Now I was raised that you don’t wear navy and black together so in my mind I look somewhat like a short, round bruise.  But, I am clean, I am dressed and I am feeling ready to deal with the day and whatever that brings. Apparently what that brings is the need for face masks.  So, this morning after I finish the Girl Scout patches I am going to go through my supplies and see what I have to make masks.  I found a pattern that uses Pellon interfacing as a filter.  I am sure I have some so I am going to try my hand at it.  How hard can it be?  I will let you know.So, with that — I need a cuppa and a little watch at the news and then off I will go.  Be back later."},

{"title": "An On We Go", "date": "Monday, March 30, 2020", "text": "We returned from New Orleans on Saturday, March 14.  On Sunday I did a grocery shopping and then entered a self-imposed quarantine because I had been around SO many people while touring NOLA. I was a little out of my comfort zone but I had no idea that NOLA would turn into such a hotbed of Covid-19.  Of course, it has been over 14 days now since our return and, even though we are free to roam from our own quarantine, we have been told to shelter in place for who knows how long.  It is a bit daunting and I won’t lie, in the beginning I was freaking out and feeling like a caged animal.  However, with time I am realizing that my day to day life really hasn’t changed much except for the occasional Target run, grocery shopping and picking up Bean from school.  Other than that it is pretty much business and usual.However, after the initial shock of the whole situation has worn off — I mean, who has the plague anymore these days?— I decided to revisit some old hobbies and interests.  One of these is cross stitch.I used to cross stitch all. the. time.  I used to even sell my finished stuff on eBay.  I still have a box of finished items waiting to be put into pillows or frames or something.  But, that doesn’t matter.  What does matter is the activity itself. About 6 years ago, on a trip home to San Antonio,  I wasn’t feeling well and chose to spend the afternoon in the hotel room while my family did the whole tourist thing.  I grew up there and didn’t really need to do that so I slept.  On their return my family had bought me a tiny cross stitch kit of the Alamo.  I started it then but didn’t finish it — I was REALLY sick — and I just finished it last night.  It is tiny — like 2X3 — and couldn’t have over 200 stitches in it if that but I pretty much had just put it aside and I am glad I picked it back up. So basically, I reconstructed the Alamo!  My daughter also brought me a kit from Boston of the Old North Church.  It is small too and I did finish it and will share a photo at another time.When I travel I have a certain criteria for souvenirs — books on the area, a Christmas ornament from the area, and a cross stitch kit of the area.  So, as we were walking (or in my case, limping) around the French quarter my daughter discovered a needlepoint shop.  Of course I was in there in a flash and the needlepoint canvases were gorgeous but I don’t enjoy needlepoint as much so as I wandered through the store I discovered a corner in the back full of cross stitch patterns.  The name of the shop was The Quarter Stitch and I loved it.Please excuse my drippy cup but I am enjoying a cup of tea as I type.  So, I digress.  I bought two patterns there — now they didn’t have the threads with them but I hoard embroidery thread so I am good — and here they are —   They are small and will make a cute grouping with the other small ones — I am going to create a “vacation” wall of tiny cross stitch pictures — nobody can accuse me of being a minimalist!  If you like needlework, check out the website for this shop — total eye candy — and in person it was heaven!My criteria for buying souvenirs are — a book, a Christmas ornament and a cross stitch kit from the area.  I will share the other souvenirs with you later. So, that is what I have been up to during this difficult time.  What about you?"},
{"title": "Yoo  Hoo!  Hello!  Just Checking!", "date": "Saturday, March 21, 2020", "text": "Hello everybody!  Just checking in to see how everybody is doing.  This is certainly surreal, isn’t it?  I don’t really know what to say about it — I am terrified, I am doing a particularly wonderful job of staying in because (1) I am terrified and (2) I am an introvert and staying in is easy for me, I do it all the time.  I am waiting for us to be locked down completely for two weeks soon.  I don’t know that for a fact, I just have a feeling.But, since I can’t do anything about it, let me tell you what I have been up to for the last couple of weeks.Last week, spring break here, we went on our annual Girl Scout Spring Break Adventure to New Orleans.  Now my daughter and my husband had been to NOLA before but I hadn’t and, of course, neither had Bean.  So, Monday of Spring Break we traveled by car from DFW to Shreveport and then from Shreveport to NOLA.  I have to say that Louisiana looks a lot like Texas.  When you get closer south, of course, you get more swampy areas and it looks more like the Texas coast but, on the whole, if I didn’t know I was in La. I would have thought I was in Texas. Lake Pontchartrain is huge.  I mean scary huge. It looked like the ocean to me.We visited the unusual cemeteries with their wild and crazy histories and stories.  I am going to do some reading about Marie Laveau — the VooDoo priestess of New Orleans.  I saw her tomb and people would leave things — hair ties mostly — I don’t know why hair ties but, well, ok.  She is buried in St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 — a very old Catholic Cemetery which is built in the style of the area — all graves are above ground because Louisiana is so near sea level.  So, they have this process — But you are going to have to research it yourself because it is gross.  I am sorry but I am having problems getting my pictures to load but Nicholas Cage has a tomb there in the shape of a pyramid.  Look it up — it is very strange and very close to Marie Laveau’s tomb.We spent two days in the French Quarter which was very interesting to me.  I am from San Antonio, Texas which has a very prominent Spanish/Mexican influence.  I grew up with it, it wasn’t “unusual” to me.  However, upon entering the French Quarter I was struck by how, well, French it was.  The buildings are old, there is wrought iron all over the place, the doors are narrow and shuttered.  The thing that struck me was the ornate vent coverings in the foundations.  I wish I had taken a picture.  They are oval wrought iron and very ornate — but apparently you can buy them at Home Depot but the ones I saw I think were very old. The first day we were there we went to the World War II Museum and it was amazing.  It is housed in a couple of buildings and  it is huge.  There was so much to see and read and hear — it was sad and grand all at the same time.  My knees were giving me a lot of trouble so I didn’t do as much walking as it required so I didn’t get to the see the Pacific exhibit which was the most interest to me because my dad was in the Pacific. I will go back one day though and do some more looking.  I think I will buy my dad and my father in law a brick for the floor to commemorate them. The last day the family went to the zoo and I stayed in the hotel room icing my knees and ankles.  I didn’t do well with the walking and I figured I would just hold them up.  They took a lot of photos though and it was an absolutely lovely zoo.  Not sure why I can’t get my photos to load.  I will have to figure that out.So you are probably wondering how we did with fighting the Coronavirus while we were there.  I drove everybody pretty crazy.  I was the keeper of the hand sanitizer.  I took Bean to the restrooms mostly and I just about annoyed her making her wash her hands and open doors with paper towels.  I was absolutely rabid about it and they all got pretty annoyed with me.  I am sure they were glad I didn’t go to the zoo.  It has been 12 days since we arrived in NOLA and we are all fine so I guess we came out on the good side.I bought souvenirs but I will take photos of those and show you in"},
{"title": "What a Challenge Coronavirus Is!", "date": "Monday, March 02, 2020", "text": "Ok, it is no secret to anybody who knows me that I am food challenged.  I don’t like meal planning, I really don’t like going to the grocery store, I have weird eating habits, I am not a great cook and let’s just say that part of domestic life is just a real challenge for me.So, enter coronavirus.  I live in Texas where they decided to offload a number of the people on the affected cruise ship.  The people aren’t in the city where I live but they are in my hometown and now there is a crisis that one of the people was released only to find out that she really is positive for the disease. So, back into isolation she goes after she visited the mall, ate at the food court, tried on some clothes, stayed at a nearby hotel — in essence just spread herself all over the area.  It wasn’t her fault, she thought she was clear. I digress.The news media, as well as state and federal health officials, are telling us to prepare to be isolated for awhile.  They are saying to have food and water stashed away for about a month.  Then they came back and said we really didn’t need to hoard water.  So, I didn’t but I don’t know how to plan to be in the house without going to the grocery store for a month.  I mean the idea of not having to go grocery shopping for a month sounds great but I don’t know how to do it.So, I have grocery shopped twice now and loaded up on frozen things and canned things.  I doubled some things and quadrupled others.  I forgot a lot of things — cornmeal to be exact.  I don’t think I have enough to feed us for a month.  As I use the stuff up, though, I am going to make a running list of what to replace because buying these large loads of groceries isn’t my idea of fun. What is fun though is looking at a full freezer and pantry — and filled with things we actually eat.  There are so many times I grocery shop and then don’t have anything to eat because I bought stuff we really don’t eat.  And I HAVE to mention the stash of Girl Scout cookies — I have twelve packages of Girl Scout cookies that are going in the freezer.  I am going to look at them everyday and see how long I can keep from eating them.  I mean, if we end up being quarantined or something I have to have cookies.So, yeah, prepping for a pandemic is confusing, tiring and not much fun.  However, I have learned a few things from it and will probably try to keep my stash up so that I don’t have to do this again.  When I was a girl we moved to a new-to-us house and the next door neighbor was new as well.  It was an elderly couple and they liked to chat with my mom.  The lady, Mrs. S, told my mom that when she moved she bought all new food rather than moving food.  She made a list of everything she ever needed and she bought a certain amount of each thing and when she would use one she would make a list and her next grocery shopping trip was made up of just what she had used out of her stash.  The houses in the neighborhood had large pantries and she would rotate her pantry so she could use up the older stuff and the new stuff went in the back.  I thought it was genius.  That is what I am going to try to do.  Tomorrow I am going to rearrange the pantry and get things more organized.Ok, that is all I am going to say about coronavirus except that I am terrified of it.  That’s all."},

{"title": "Happy Valentine’s Day", "date": "Friday, February 14, 2020", "text": "I will be honest.  I am not a fan of Valentine’s Day in the Hallmark sense of the holiday.  It has always been a huge amount of pressure to me.  I remember as a child I found this gorgeous box of candy at the grocery store and I kept pointing it out — it was pink — and I wanted that box so badly. I didn’t really care about the candy but the box was gorgeous.  The day came and I got a large box of candy but it was red and it wasn’t as pretty and I remember my mother asking me if it was okay.  Well, in the first place, I felt like a ridiculously selfish spoiled child wanting something and being disappointed not getting it.  I should have been more grateful.  What I got was fine — the same brand, the same size — it just wasn’t pink.  I was probably about 8.  I have learned a lot since then.Then there was the valentine exchange at school.  Back in the day we weren’t required to give valentines to everybody in the class.  If you only wanted to give a few you could.  We didn’t even have valentine boxes, we decorated brown paper bags and taped them to our desks and everybody would drop their cards in the bags.  I wasn’t popular so I lived in fear of having an empty bag. I never was empty but it was a fear — how embarrassing to be the one kid with no cards.  Too much pressure.Then came along the boyfriends.  I hated the pressure — do I get them something with no idea that I will get anything.  They were boys, they were poor — what in the world do I expect?  I expected nothing and that was a good thing in most of the cases.  Then there was the boy who stole his mother’s savings stamp books (remember those?) and bought me two enormous stuffed animals — a poodle and an elephant.  He gave them to me in a toilet paper case — unwrapped.  Didn’t really know what to say about that one.  My last boyfriend (now husband) did better but by that time I was done with the whole thing.  I remember what pushed me over the heart shaped edge.  My cousin’s boyfriend (younger cousin I might add) bought her a little “promise” ring with linked hearts and a tiny diamond chip where they joined — quite common in the 60’s and 70’s — and I told my BF that i would love to have one — he looked at me and straight up said no.  I got mad, he didn’t care, and I gave up on Valentine’s Day.  I might add that, in his defense, he routinely brought me roses when he would come home from college and just a few months after the promise ring incident I was presented with a custom made 3/4 karat diamond engagement ring.  Was I thrilled? Yes.  Did I feel guilty about the stink I made about the promise ring?  Yes and no — it was childish and silly but I really wanted that ring! So, now, we don’t celebrate Valentine’s Day.  I buy cards for my grandkids — usually silly cards — not mushy and that is it.  I still don’t like the holiday and don’t miss it at all.  But kudos for those who love it — and a lot of people do — I wouldn’t begrudge them of the joy it brings but just not my thing."},

Texas and we have the threat of rain.  It isn’t doing anything out there right now it who knows — I am sure the weather wizards will let us know.Oh, if you click on the photos you can enlarge them and get a better look at Penelope."},
{"title": "Mr. Popper’s Penguins — Bean and Me Book Club", "date": "Wednesday, February 05, 2020", "text": "I recently finished my third book for my Goodreads Challenge.  It is a children’s book titled “Mr. Popper’s Penguins”.  It was a fun read and recommended to me by the Bean.  I recommend it although I have to wonder, is Mr. Popper going to get home?  Hmm...My reading isn’t going very swimmingly it seems.  I usually read faster than I have been in this new year.  I am not sure why except that I read when I go to bed and lately I have been crashing early on.I am currently reading a children’s book called “Pax” and it is a slow go.  I hope to be done soon so I can move on to a couple of new titles I just acquired.It has been a yucky day here.  We were supposed to get some wintery weather but all we got was some rain and cloudy weather.  It is supposed to be warm again soon for the weekend.I feel like I am getting a cold so I am making some soup today.  It is just one of those days.I have been interested in doing some needlework again so I bought a magazine to get me inspired.  Hopefully I will do more than just read the magazine!And, I have been researching the concept of a “capsule pantry” — stocking the pantry with what I actually use and nothing more.  I know that sounds ridiculous but some of us tend to go to the grocery store and buy stuff we really don’t need/use.  It also involves having the ingredients on hand for what we DO cook.  So far so good.  I have managed `to effortlessly cook a couple of meals although I am missing some ingredients so I need to make a new list.  This is a learning curve for sure.I have a headache so I am hope I am not getting whatever it is my daughter has.  She tested negative for the flu but they are treating her for the flu.  Whatever, she feels really crummy and I haven’t seen her for days.I am tired of the politics on tv.  I am not politically motivated in the first place and they have messed up all my tv programming for two weeks — OVER IT!Ok, rant over.  Time for lunch."},
{"title": "Cookie Time!", "date": "Sunday, January 19, 2020", "text": "Well, folks, it is that time of year again!  Girl Scouts are out everywhere selling cookies to support their camping habit.  Our girls are doing the same as they are raising money for their first cabin camping trip to Stevens Ranch, one of the Girl Scout camps here in North Texas. I went to Outdoor Camping 101 training and learned all I needed to know about outdoor camping.  I won’t be going I don’t think.  Time will tell but the stories about the spiders were enough to turn me off.Anyway, yesterday Bean had her stash of “Cookie Now” cookies which are 12 cases checked out to individual girls to have an individual booth or walk their neighborhood or whatever.  They are theirs to sell on their own.So, Bean had a booth at a large shopping area.  There was great foot traffic, the weather was sunny but cold and windy and she managed to sell 121 of her 144 boxes there.  Then, when that was done she walked my street and sold 7 more in orders and then she walked her street and she sold 31 more in orders.  All in all a good day.The morning after?  The adults can hardly move and the pollen in her hair has caused Beanie’s allergies to flare up so while we did well, there is a price, other than the $5 per box, to pay.  The troop sales start next week and I pray for good weather.  This time of the year is always iffy.I put Bean’s blog on the side panel of mine so if you want to visit, just click on The Life of Bean and it will take you right there.  I think she is a little disheartened to not have any visitors so feel free to stop by and say hello to her.Ok, time to get the day started. Our grandson officially becomes a teenager today — 13 years old — hard to believe that tiny little baby I held and took care of is now a 13 year old with a changed voice and taller than his mom.  Time flies when you aren’t watching it for sure.Have a wonderful Sunday."},

I am so unmotivated in cold weather so the most I have managed today is dealing with Trixie and sewing Girl Scout patches on Bean’s vest.  I will be going out in a bit and have plans later in the day but it is very icky out and I won’t be enjoying it.  I will make the best of it however.In the meantime, here are some photos of the puppy...."},
{"title": "Blessed and a New Reality", "date": "Tuesday, January 14, 2020", "text": "Many years ago, when I was just small I asked my mother if she could feel her heart beat.  She answered in the negative, asked if I could and looked a bit panicked when I said yes, all the time.Fast forward to 1973.  I was on an awkward telephone call and my heart started pounding to the point that the bed I was sitting on was moving. It scared me so bad that I made an appointment with my childhood doctor the next day and went to demand that he tell me what’s wrong with me.  “Nothing is wrong with you, never has been and I have known you since day one.  It is atrial tachycardia.  Nothing serious”.1975 found me in my on-gyn’s office at the beginning of my first pregnancy and the doctor says “your heart is beating hard and fast”.   “Yes, it does that a lot”.  “Hmmmpppp, atrial tachycardia, it’s nothing”.1979 was a repeat of 1975.Fast forward to 2006 and after my husband had bypass surgery I had an event where my heart went out of sinus rthym and that began a series of events that continued until last week.  I was sure I had aFib — an arrhythmia caused by any number of things and it seems to run in my family.   A while back my cousin called to tell me what was going on with her — yep, aFib — a hospitalization and a couple of procedures.  She encouraged me to check it out since I was doing pretty much the same thing.I did.  I visited the cardiologist on December 12 and had an EKG which was normal.  I then wore a heart monitor for a week, returned to the doctor two weeks later and had an echocardiogram which was normal.  The report from the heart monitor showed the arrhythmia and the diagnosis is atrial tachycardia.  Not aFib.  Not particularly serious but more bothersome. Atria tachycardia is treated by the use of beta blockers.  I have been prescribed a common drug — my husband takes the same — and within hours of the first pill all the drama and fluttering and racing in my chest had stopped and hasn’t, knock on wood, come back.  I have slept well, I feel good and I feel blessed that it wasn’t anything worse than that.Now I have a Fitbit to track my movement which isn’t great due to the gimpy knees and trying to lose a little weight — my decision, not doctors.  It is a fun device — and I am always looking for fun.Last night I attended Girl Scout Outdoor Training 101 in preparation for camping season. Haha haha— what a hoot!  That is a post in and of itself but I just can’t imagine me camping — unless it is at a Hilton or Marriot.  We will see about that!"},

Also, Bean has started her own blog and would love some visitors.  It is called The Life of Bean.  Feel free to stop by."},
{"title": "Use It or Lose it", "date": "Saturday, January 04, 2020", "text": "When I was young I loved to make lists and catalogue things.  I used to sit and practice different styles of handwriting.  I loved to write stories.  I enjoyed the physical action of writing. When I was in school I learned to type and as I progressed through the educational system more and more things were typewritten.  I went to work and typing was what I did.  Now with computers keyboarding is even more a part of my lifeSo, as I was thinking about my Goodreads 2020 Reading Challenge I started thinking about keeping a record of what I have read in the past, how best to organize the information so that I don’t repurchase books or start books that I have already read and have forgotten (me, forget?  Never! Right.). As you  might have noticed I have been keeping a running list here but it is getting a bit too unwieldy so I thought I should build some sort of a notebook.Off to Target I went for a binder, some paper and dividers and new pens.  I sat down to make a page for each author I have read and and list the books on the page.  Sounds doable, right?Well, I can’t write anymore.  I have arthritis in my hands and I can hardly hold a pen for any length of time.  My handwriting doesn’t even remotely resemble my handwriting and it didn’t take too many pages for my hand to start cramping up.It makes me sad because I was looking so forward to making this notebook to keep up with my reading.  I did finish it but it looks like a little kid wrote it and I didn’t enjoy the process like I thought I would.  So, annoying!So, while we are becoming more and more technological remember that if you don’t use it you could lose it and I think losing the ability to write is a huge loss. So, every now and then sit down and just write to make sure you still can!"},

It is “The Boy on the Porch” by Sharon Creech.  It is the story of a mute boy being left on the porch of a young married couple to be tended to until his parents return to get him.  He was left with a crumpled, poorly written note with no end date.He stayed.  The grown ups became attached and, as you would figure, his father showed up to get him after he had been there a long time.How did he affect their lives?  How did his going affect their lives?  And.......did he come back?I don’t think this is a book that children would enjoy even though it was very well written.  I read it in one setting but I found it repetitive. It was interesting enough for me to keep going but I don’t know if I would recommend it.Hi all!  After her first post to the Bean and Me Book Club, Bean has decided to start her own blog.   It is attached to mine for security and the title is The Life of Bean and you are invited to read what she has to say.  Not sure how long it will hold her interest but we will see.  She loves to read and has always written stories so we are hoping she will use this venue to hone her skills!Welcome to The Life of Bean!"},

{"title": "January 2 — And the car is ready — almost", "date": "Thursday, January 02, 2020", "text": "Just before Christmas the car did something horrible.  It has been making a noise and then one day the a/c and the power steering stopped and there was this dreadful stench of something burning.  We managed to pull into a service station and Hubs discovered that the serpentine belt had broken and, in the process, it broke the bracket that held the whatchamacallit that held the whole thing together. We made it home but couldn’t get it to the dealer for the repair so it had to be towed.  It has been there ever since.We just heard today that it is almost, very nearly ready, but the computer console is out (we knew that, thank you Caliber Collision) and the check engine light is on — we didn’t know that because it wasn’t that way when we sent it.  So, they are doing diagnostics on it. Somehow I don’t feel very secure anymore and it is a Subaru which is supposed to be a very reliable car.  I now really have the new car bug.  Sigh.I am in the market for a copy of our church’s new prayer book, the 2019 Book of Common Prayer ACNA.  We started using it in church a few weeks ago and it is much the same but yet so different in a few aspects but I need a copy to really be able to sit down and compare.  I looked at Amazon and it isn’t available yet so I went to the publisher and I can get one from them.  I don’t want a pew edition, I want a nicely bound one and they do have that so I will be thinking about ordering in the near future.I have started my Bible reading.  Of course, I have read the Bible in spurts, in parts, all my life but I have a goal to actually sit down and read it.  I recently purchased a copy of the English Standard Version and find it reads really well so this morning I had a perfectly enjoyable read right after breakfast.  A few years back my husband bought me this beautiful study Bible with lots of info about the regions, the life at the time — just a lot of stuff — but the print is so light, sort of a light taupe on white that I can’t read it.  I do love the book though and the information therein but the format is terrible.  This one is much more “user friendly”.So far my new plan is working well.  The street tacos were yummy, the kitchen was cleaned immediately after dinner (not after I “rested”) and my night time routine went off without a hitch.  I like routine and I like getting back to one.  It sounds silly, I know, but I have always changed the sheets on Monday (crib sheets were daily).  If I can stick to the Monday sheet thing I feel in control.  My sheets were done on Monday and all is right with my week! Silly old girl I am.Have a wonderful Thursday! My kitchen is clean and I am going to the pet store to try to find some indestructible toys for the girl he"},

I then took the pupper to bed because she didn’t like the fireworks and I went about my new nightly routine and took myself to bed with my book.I haven’t signed up for my 2020 Goodreads challenge yet.  I am trying to decide how I want to do it.  I am thinking of following my daughters lead and read an adult fiction, a YA or children’s fiction and a non-fiction book each month.  That is a lot of reading but that is my escape of choice so I should be able to do it.  I am currently finishing up “Plantation” by Dorothea Benton Frank and the autobiography of Freddie Mercury.  I won’t have any problem finding children’s books because Bean keeps me well stocked on those and most of what she reads are really pretty interesting.  My daughter has already suggested a non-fiction book issued in England to explain to the British people exactly what was going on with Hitler and why they were going to war.  It is supposed to be a really good read so that might be one I add.Sugar.  The only thing that I am doing that is going to look at all like a resolution is to reduce my sugar intake.  I had done well with that but somehow backslid and here I am eating too much again.  I don’t look at that as a resolution, though, more like just a change of habit. I am working toward meal planning and tonight we are having street tacos.  I love tacos.  I have always loved tacos.  Tacos will pretty much fix anything.  So, we are having tacos on these cute little street taco tortillas.  Growing up in South Texas and eating in public schools pretty much wired me for Mexican on Wednesday so.....it is Wednesday and it is Mexican and that is part of my new plan!So, on that note, I am going to put in another load of laundry and read a chapter in my book after I see what the dog is so viciously chewing on.  It could be my chair.  Who knows.

{"title": "The Bean and Me Book Club — El Deafo", "date": "Sunday, December 29, 2019", "text": "The Bean and Me Book Club has been on hiatus for a bit while the Bean works on getting her OCD under control.  Anxiety in an old lady like me is one thing, but in a 9 year old who is supposed to be enjoying life, well, it hasn’t been a fun time.  Steps are being taken to deal with her issues and make life easier for her to learn to cope with her little overactive, worried brain.Things seem to be getting better though and she is beginning to enjoy all the things she used to before       OCD became a part of her life.   One of those things is reading.  She always wanted to read and once she could, it was her main activity.  Now her goal is to surpass one million words on her AR tests by the end of the spring semester.  She is, once again, sharing her books with me and we are reading and discussing them as usual.My latest read is “El Deafo” by CeCe Bell.  It is the story of CeCe who contracts meningitis at a very young age and, while she survives and thrives quite well, she is left hearing impaired.  It is the story of her journey through the process of discovering her deafness, learning to live with it and learning to live in the world as a child with a challenge.  It is a great story of acceptance. It is also a great story of learning about people, their strengths and their shortcomings, and how to discover and deal with the people who come into your life, how to choose your friends and do what is best for you.This is a very good book, especially for a child going through a challenge but it is an excellent read for any child learning to understand people with differences — we all have them, right?So, yes, this is a definite recommend for all ages and being written in the graphic novel style, it is a quick and fun read.  And, there are enough “adult” references that make it tolerable and not oh-so-serious for adults as well."},
{"title": "Revisit and Plan", "date": "Friday, December 27, 2019", "text": "It is getting to that time of the year that we all sit back and take a look at the year we have just lived.  I don’t much believe in resolutions because I tend to break them before the ink is dry on the list.  I do, however, like to look back at what worked, what was successful and what needs to be re-evaluated.I have been doing some thinking about planning — planning meals, planning my days, planning projects — just planning in general.  I buy lovely Erin Condren  planners every year and I do use the calendar section for the ever increasing doctor appointments and school schedules and such but I think I could benefit by using the other sections for meal planning and housekeeping schedules.Now, you are probably wondering why an old lady like me needs to plan things.  We are retired, shouldn’t I just be able to “be” (as my daughter likes to say).  Well, the problem with that is that when I just “be”, nothing gets done except tv watching and net surfing.  Before you know it, there is nothing in the house to eat and the laundry has piled up and I can write my name in the dust on the furniture.  But, the net has been duly surfed.I find all of this just makes my anxiety and my depression explode.  It has come to my realization that just because I don’t have children in the house doesn’t mean that I don’t need a schedule.  I have also realized that, because of my mobility issues, I put things off until I have a monumental task to complete and not nearly enough energy to do it.  So..........I must rethink things.Now, since Hubs stroke and hypoglycemia issues, we have been following a much better diet and things have been going well with that.  It does make cooking easy because there is more of a formula and he is helping by grilling a good deal.  Steak or chicken with salad and a vegetable and a small amount of carb is the order of the day and is much less taxing on me but my problem is that I don’t plan and I am always forgetting something at the store which means I don’t always have what I need and that is frustrating.  So, I need to plan my meals.  We are eating out again but he is making good choices and his blood sugar has been in excellent control — to the point that his meds have been reduced and he might even be able to get off of the injectable.  So, that is great and the eating plan is making it easier for me.  But, I still need to plan.The housework is a big problem for me.  I am lazy.  I don’t like to dust and dragging a large vacuum cleaner around is not my idea of something I jump up in the morning and yell “yay, let’s vacuum”.  So, I bought a Dyson cordless stick vac — the one for animal hair even though the Trixster doesn’t really shed.  It is a lifesaver.  And, the canister releases from the “stick” and I can use it to vacuum the furniture with the nifty little attachments.  It has been a good thing.  I have also gone from mop and bucket to the Bona floor care system.  It is helpful as well — especially with the untrainable Miss Trixster.  She is doing better with the potty pads and almost always “hits” them — expect for when she doesn’t but things have improved.  I feel accomplished in learning these new ways to do things but now I have to continue decluttering.  Today I am going to work on the massive magazine collection.  I love to take magazines but I need to move past saving them.  I have gotten to the point that I read them and toss them but I do have a rather large basket full of them to plow through.  That is on the list for today.So, while I am not contemplating sharing any huge resolutions with you, I will be sharing changes I am making in my day to day life to try to make things easier for me as I age (yes I actually said that) and am finding things more difficult.  I don’t want to have to struggle and I don’t want to wallow in depression and anxiety because life is changing, I want to find new and better ways to do things so that I can continue to do the things I enjoy.On that note I am off to Walmart! I never thought I would say that — I don’t like Walmart but the Hubs has a mission so off we go.Have a great day!"},

I have been struggling with anxiety and depression, brought on I am sure, by my worsening arthritis and increasing immobility.  So I am hoping for a better go in 2020.I have done a lot of reading lately but failed to meet my Goodreads goal.  I will do better in the coming year.I have started seriously decluttering areas of the house.  I have learned there is a significant link between anxiety and clutter and I am making an effort to declutter on a daily basis.  My closet has gone well as has my makeup drawer but the craft stuff is going to be a bear.  I am passing on a few books but those are the hardest to get rid of.  I really value books, even yellowing, brittle paperbacks but there is only so much room.  I have succeeded in lessening the amount of reading material coming into the house by using my kindle or my kindle app on my iPad but I will never quit buying books.We did a little dressing up of the upstairs craft room to make it more kid friendly. I have my craft table which is really a work bench but it looks really nice.  We got it at The Container Store.  Then we added a red leather sofa and a coffee table.  We took some of our paintings out of storage and hung them, refurbished some lamps, added a new, larger tv and voila, a good place for everybody to hang out.   I will take some photos the next time I venture up there but right at the moment my joints are laughing at me even thinking about going up the stairs.I might go later and buy a keyboard case for my iPad to make typing the blog easier than this one finger hunt and peck action going on.  I have thought about buying a new computer but can’t get excited about it at the moment. Maybe later.So, anyway, I thought I would check in to let everybody know I am still amongst the living although I am not very mobile at the moment and less motivated."},
{"title": "Hello, All!", "date": "Monday, November 04, 2019", "text": "Good morning!   Finally had a few minutes to chat for a bit.  Things have been very active of late between doctor appointments, trying to help get Bean straightened out, having some work done around the house and forever trying to housebreak this little fur monster we live with, it is never ending.I had my annual oncologist appointment and all seems to be well, don’t need to see him for another year. I do believe I need to visit a cardiologist though, and I am due for an eye appointment. I dread the eye appointment because it is all the way across town by our old house and I really want to find somebody closer but I don’t care for breaking in new people, do you?  I have given up on dealing with my knees and just figure they are part of getting old.The hubs has been painting the inside of the house which is going much quicker than I thought it would. Several weeks ago we ordered plantation shutters for the windows and they have been delivered and installed.  We need to work on the bathrooms which are covered in rather dated wallpaper. Dealing with wallpaper removal is dreadful. We might end up just re-papering over it. A pain either way.Girl Scounts has been particularly active.  We had a birthday party for Juliet Gordon Low, the founder. It was supposed to be outside but the weather had turned so we had 17 girls and a few parents in the house. It worked out ok though.  Not Scout related but Bean made a lovely Evie for Halloween. The pooch is getting better about her business. She has finally gotten what the puppy pads are for so the moment some of the frantic pressure is off her.  She is ringing the bells more often than not and the accident are few and far between but when there is one she manages to make use of the pads so life is easier.So here we are, already November.  Can’t believe this year is going so quickly!  Not ready to think about the holidays yet even though my neighbor has already put up lights. Too early in my book. For now that is all the news.  That is ok with me, I like a little calm."},
{"title": "My Absence", "date": "Sunday, October 13, 2019", "text": "I haven’t been around my blog much lately and it isn’t because I have lost interest. There are two main reasons — one, my iPad and the second is my granddaughter, not in order of importance.My laptop bit the dust a while. Back and I replaced with a more powerful iPad.  I am finding it to be difficult to use for my blog. That makes it a lot less fun to do.  It is more work and it has sort of put me off but I have no intention of not blogging. I will make it work.The other thing that has been taking a good deal of my time, thought and energy is the Bean.  She has been diagnosed with  Obsessive Compulsive Anxiety Disorder.  Looking back she was probably born with it.  It appears to be genetic and I know the disorder existed in members of my family and still does.  Something caused a flare, however, in the last school year and I believe it was an unfortunate teacher.  I know it is easy to blames somebody like a teacher, my daughter gets that all the time, but this particular teacher was a real train wreck.  She would say inappropriate things and have full on panic attacks in front of the children.  It was horrific yet she retained her job through the entire year.We felt this year would be a new start but, alas, the  demon reared its ugly head and now we are all working to make things better. The way this presents in her is different than you see on television programs —she isn’t oddly tidy, she doesn’t aphabetize or count or line things up.  She has intrusive thoughts that she can’t control and they keep her from concentrating on what she should be thinking about.  The thoughts concern the weather and her health.  She is terrified of stormy weather and she is worried about being electrocuted or having her arms dislocate or getting a concussion.  This comes directly down the DNA pike from my grandmother who was terrified of weather and her health.  My daughter says she wishes she were tidy.  Oh yes, my daughter is clearly OCD as well, even though it presents differently in her, there is some overlap and yes, she is tidy.So, the Bean is under a doctors care, receiving medication and seeing a therapist to help her control  the situation.  She has a new friend  at school who has the same thing although it presents differently in him but they have become each other’s support group and it is working well.  She is back in school, her grades are good, she has taken up dance as a new endeavor, she seems to be back to her old self and doing well but oh my goodness, this has all happened so quickly and so intense, it has made this Nona’s head spin. She is reading again so I hope to have some more entries in the Bean and Me Book Club soon.  She will be fine, not sure about the rest of us.On a more upbeat note, autumn has arrived here in North Texas and it is glorious!The latest book I have  completed for my 2019 reading challenge is “The Secret Orphan” by Glynis Peters.  It is the story Elenor from Tre Lodhen, Cornwall and Rose, a child from Coventry.  It is set in World War II Britain. This is a historical novel chock full of mystery, espionage, secrets and a little romance but it definitely isn’t a romance novel.  I think it provides a small window into the lives of the British during  that very frightening time and gives good examples of how resourceful they were.For me this was a page turner.  I simply couldn’t put it down and I recommend as a great read for all."},

Even my reading has hit a lull and my crafting has ceased altogether.As .you know my husband had a couple of diabetes related issues back in the spring.  Well since then we have been to a specialist and seen a diabetes counselor about his diet and I have to say it is all going very well.  His blood sugar is staying quite normal and his doctor visit this week was stellar.   It isn’t a bad eating plan and we are living very normally now although I never thought I would see the day when he would eat yogurt and oatmeal but here we are.We sold our former home recently which is a big relief.  I loved the house but it was a bit smaller than we needed and the distance from the kids was taking a toll on our energy and our gas bill. So now that we have completed the sale we are embarking on some much needed projects here in our current home. The Hubs has painted over half the interior, we have changed out a number of light fixtures and we have ordered shutters for the windows. We are painting the interior the same color as the old house which is called Wise Owl.  The trim will be white to match the shutters. It is going to be lovely!I will share photos when the shutters arrive and all the clutter is cleared away.  It won’t be long.So just letting you know I am still kicking but more than a little tired,"},

It looks like my blog plan didn’t work so well, can’t stay on task or really focus lately,  Things will be better when this house sale is completed.  It seems to be sapping all my physical and mental energy.  Hopefully the 23rd will come and go without issue and we can pass the ownership over to somebody else.  Yesterday was strange because we went to check the mail and there were six cars in the driveway and people all over.  Seems the buyers had family in town and wanted to show them the I know that is allowable but it seemed strange.Today is errands and back to picking up the Bean from school.  All four grandkids are going to be in the same school so I will probably see all of the at some point.  That is going to be different but they are looking forward to it.  I wish they didn’t have to go back so early as it is just too hot.So, off to make oatmeal and get the day started.  The morning will go fast and I have to make a grocery run and a trip to the bank.  So uninteresting!  I will try to do something exciting for the next time.  I promise you Trixie’s life is much more interesting."},

It sold the first day on the market and we had the inspection but either the inspector is stupid or they are trying to put one over on us but they reduced their offer price and are requiring us to fix things that aren’t broken. So, the saga continues.Today we meet with Hubs endocrinologist to re-evaluate his situation and see how to continue moving forward.  We are also meeting with a diabetes counselor which is new to us.  With all that is going on I am probably going to have to meet with somebody with a couch and some happy pills.  Hopefully all will go well today and hopefully the house situation will work out.  I am feeling very Pollyanna today.I have finished reading \"Wish\" and have now started another Made in Savannah cozy mystery.  They are very relaxing and that works well for me right now.So off to see the doctor in a little while.  Will be back with any news."},

I thought Trixie killed herself this morning.  She was jumping up to grab a dog biscuit from me and slipped on the kitchen floor and banged her head on the tile floor.  She didn’t miss a lick though and got right back up and continued jumping so I guess all is well.Well, off to meet the realtor so fingers crossed this house sale will go quickly."},

{"title": "The Bean and Me Book Club", "date": "Tuesday, July 09, 2019", "text": "The Bean and Me Book Club is a joint effort of my granddaughter and I to read the same books and review them.  Obviously these are youth books but don’t mistake that for being childish or simplistic.  Some of the books Bean brings to the table are really good and very engaging for an adult as well.Right now I am reading “Wish” on her recommendation.  It is about Charlie, a girl who has been shipped off to live with her aunt and uncle because her mom is severely depressed and can’t get out of bed and her dad is in jail.  She doesn’t fit in very well in her school and she has a chip on her shoulder as big as the county.  She has become obsessed with rescuing and caring for a stray dog that has been lurking about trying to get her attention.  Her uncle and her friend Howard, who walks up down (limps) are going to help her.That is my stopping point.  I am hoping that today they figure out where the dog goes when he is hiding out!  So far it is a good story although some of the circumstances are a little adult but certainly not unrealistic.  Bean handled it well and didn’t get bogged down in the sad parts.  She won’t tell me what happens so I guess I am going to have to finish soon so I can find out for myself. I will let you know!I read some really lovely blogs.  I love visiting with my blog friends every day and seeing what is going on in their lives.  I love seeing all the photos as well.  It makes me think about my own blog and not in a very good way.I enjoy playing with the layouts and color combos.  I get a kick out of different fonts. However what doesn’t seem to be as good as it should be is the content.  That is sort of a big deal because that is why people visit blogs.  So I am thinking about being a bit more organized about my writing.  I am thinking about assigning a topic for each day of the week.  For example, Monday could be The Trixie Chronicles, Tuesday could be the Bean and Me Book Club, Wednesday could be about cardmaking, Thursday could be about faith (that should actually be first), Friday could be about cooking or fashion or something.  Anyway, you get the picture.  So, since yesterday I introduced The Trixie Chronicles, I think today will be about the Bean and Me Book Club. I have always thought blogs should be sort of random but that makes it difficult sometimes when there is no direction.  I really enjoy blogging because it gives me a venue to write.  My goal in life was to be a writer and, of course, that didn’t happen but I still like to put my thoughts down on paper. Sometimes it is a great way to clear your mind. So, I am hoping to be a better blogger with a plan.  We will see how it goes.And here are some photos for you — my fairy gardens in pots"},
{"title": "The Trixie Chronicles", "date": "Monday, July 08, 2019", "text": "Hi there! My name is Trixie and I am a 4 month old Yorkshire Terrier.  I came to live with Mommy Nona and Grampsey two weeks ago.  I came from Cleburne where I  lived with my four sisters.   I am  not much dog —less than five pounds —but I am so much more than that.  I am a supreme escape artist, a potty training challenge, a cuddly ball of fluff and an Olympic grade runner every night about 8 pm. I am also a practical joker.  The first two days I was here my human folks thought I was so quiet and polite.  I didn’t let them hear my big threatening bark for the first week.  I had to laugh because the first time Mommy Nona heard me she wasn’t sure it was a bark!  I really only bark when they put me in my crate and I don’t want to be there.  Seems they think it’s ok to ignore me.  Hmmmmp.Mommy Nona is really beside herself because no matter how hard she tries I still have accidents inthe house.  I am really stealthy like.  So today we went on an outing to Petco.  I went and even got to ride outside my crate.  BUT, when we got there she bought a big box and some pellets and she thinks she is going to make me potty like a cat!  Haha, Mommy Nona is so fun——-ny!  We all know that isn’t going to work but we will play the game for a while because apparently she doesn’t have anything else to do.  It does look like the laundry is piling up though. Oh, the pellets are really tasty too.So, the last two weeks have been interesting.  I have been loved on (that’s nice), yelled at (just once), taken outside a bazillion times and told to “go potty” more than that.  I am pretty independent, really slippery, rather tiny and loved by everybody even if I have no intention of ever telling them when I need to go out.Well, it is past my bedtime.  So until the next time......Nighty nite from me, the Trixster!  Oh, hi Jack!"},

She has been quite entertaining and a joy to have.Moving on to yesterday -- they all returned home to find Snowball asleep on top of her bedding, breathing very shallow and unresponsive.  Crisis ensused.  Daddy was summoned from the grocery store to deal with the unthinkable.After much research, Daddy decided that Snowball might be hibernating, something that even  hamster house pets can do even though I had never heard of it.So, Snowball was covered with a little fleece blanket and watched to see if warming her up would produce a miracle.Apparently she moved out from under the blanket during the night but when they looked at her this morning she was no longer breathing and her ears were flat.Daddy still thought she might be hibernating so he covered her up again and put a warm water bottle in the cage with her to see if he could warm her up. That was the last I heard.My daughter doesn't think she is hibernating, she believes she has gone to hammy heaven.  I have no clue because I have never heard of hamsters hibernating even though I have had many hamsters in my children's lives. The funeral is planned for this evening in my back yard.Unless there is a miracle resurrection.I will let you know."},

Sika wanted to ask the Snowfather to heal her grandfather and make him well to be able to make the race himself during the next True Winter.The children met with all sorts of peril and danger along the way.  My favorite was the Yeti Noodle Bar where one could get trapped forever if one was not careful.The Bean loved this book but she is perplexed that it has taken me weeks to finish it and she accomplished that in an hour.  It is a cute book, good message and great illustrations. I would recommend for school age children and adults who want to get lost in the fantasy.As you probably remember, my family vacationed in Savannah, Georgia last year. I was completely taken with the place, the culture, the food, the architecture -- yes, I could live there -- well, in the winter anyway because I understand that the summers are pretty bad with the heat.So, since then, I have been reading a lot of books that involve Savannah.  The latest is \"Temple Secrets\" by Susan Gabriel.It is the story of the Temple family -- a generations old Savannah family with connections to slavery and a whole lot of secrets.  The family is a blended family -- black and white -- wealthy landowners and slaves in the past and this is the modern day remnants of that family.The main characters would appear to be Iris Temple, along with the  daughter and granddaughter of the some of the most influential men of Savannah at their time.  However, Iris's demise takes her out of the story pretty early and the attention goes to her half sister, Queenie, and her granddaughter, Violet.  Queenie is the daughter of Iris's father and Old Sally, a black housekeeper at the time.Then there is Rose.  Rose is Iris's daughter with her husband Oscar.  She is Violet's half sister with Queenie being Violet's mother and Oscar being Violet's father.  History repeating itself.And I thought my family tree was confusing.And then there is the Book of Secrets.  It is a ledger that was kept of all the indiscretions of Savannah's rich and famous over the decades.   This book takes on a life of its own.And Edward -- what an idiot.And the ghosts.I will just leave that here.  If you love Savannah, the south, ghosts or a humorous, messed up family story this is the book for you. Next on my list -- the sequel  -- \"Gullah Secrets\". Hopefully it will be just as enjoyable."},

It is a very, VERY balanced diet.  Almost anything can be enjoyed on this diet in the portions allowed on the diet.  There is only one snack and that is in the evening.  It isn't a bad diet, I am following it as well and have lost five pounds.  The thing to get used to is having just a small amount of starch and not eating between meals. Ok, so my husband has done really well but he is now beginning to balk about the food.  I am not a chef.  I am not even a very good home cook.  I mean, one time when I was pregnant with my daughter, we ate boxed mac and cheese five nights in a row.  Doing all of this is clearly out of my comfort zone.So, he complained about the green beans at lunch and offered to take me out to dinner.  He said I needed a break.  I think HE needs restaurant food which we are supposed to be weaning ourselves from.I had to have our daughter \"speak\" to him.  Sad.I am thinking of sending him for a little visit to his sister."},

{"title": "If It's Not One Thing It is Another.....", "date": "Wednesday, March 27, 2019", "text": "my aunt used to say that all the time and it appears she was a very wise and knowledgeable little lady.It happened again Saturday morning.  We were just getting into our day when my husband walked into our study to look at something, came back to ask me a question and discovered he couldn't speak.He has an evil sense of humor and I thought he was playing with me.  Upon further observation, I discovered he wasn't.We got dressed, called for an ambulance and headed for the hospital -- one that specializes in stroke care because he was exhibiting all the classic symptoms of a stroke.  Oddly, however, he walked in, got dressed, combed his hair, brushed his teeth, gathered his wallet and other items, put on his shoes and socks and waited for the ambulance to arrive.Halfway through the 20 minute drive to the hospital the situation resolved itself and he was speaking plainly, laughing, talking about our granddaughter and signing papers.  Immediately upon arrival they started doing stroke assessment tests and he had no deficits and never experienced any symptoms again.He was tested, MRI'd, CT scanned, walked, prodded, drained of blood, questioned (raise your eyebrows, stick your tongue out, follow my finger, touch my nose, now touch your nose, what is happening in this picture I am showing you) and assessed.He was sent home yesterday without restrictions.  We had lunch and went to Target. The most bizarre situation I have ever seen.Why did this happen?  Probably an acute blood pressure spike incident.  Diabetes that is not well controlled could have been involved. So, meds have been changed and fiddled with.  We are now following a diabetic exchange diet which we have never used before so it is a learning curve for this old brain but not too terrible.  We are visiting with our family doctor today -- I am sure he isn't going to be happy with us but oh well. His blood sugar (my husband, not the doctor) has been falling very low in the mornings.  He has also been having some rather disturbing symptoms of a sleep disorder.  After watching what went on in the hospital I was beginning to conclude that the sleep disturbances were due to something physiological -- oh, say, blood sugar that is too low.  So, I asked the neurologist and she assured me that it could most definitely be connected.  I asked the dietician (who looked like a 12 year old) and she also assured me that the blood sugar issues could, in fact, cause such symptoms.So, we are now on an exchange diet which is proving to be a bit of a challenge for me.  However, I saw a huge difference this morning.  He woke up normally and, even though he wanted to go back to sleep, he had his wits and control enough to make himself get up and get busy (I mean, seriously, NOBODY wants to get up do they?) and his blood sugar was a much healthier number which just sort of proves what the doctors said.I would be lying if I said I wasn't tired.  I am but I am so very thankful that this wasn't worse than it was.  I am thankful that the hospital was specialized, that he was thoroughly tested and we have the opportunity to try to get things under control.I have said that I think this was a blessing in disguise, God's little tap on the shoulder to say \"hey, Al, you need to get your stuff together, you just ain't living right\".  While that may sound silly or extreme to some, it is what I believe. We are blessed.God is good ALL the time an God's way is the right way, ALL the time."},
{"title": "Did You Miss Me?", "date": "Tuesday, March 19, 2019", "text": "Last week was spring break here in most of Texas.  My daughter decided to do a repeat performance of last  year and take her daughter on a Girl Scout patch/badge seeking adventure across Texas.  Texas has lots of history so there were quite a few opportunities to learn the history and to earn more bling for the GS vest.We decided to tag along and were also joined by our son and his family.  That is the first time for this sort of adventure with all of us together.We were gone for eight days and visited a number of places in several cities.  I will share this trip across several posts. We left last Saturday morning and headed South to Austin where we toured the Capitol building.  I had never seen the Capitol and I still didn't see it because the walk to the building from the parking garage sent my knees into despair so I sat out the whole thing.  There were benches in the rotunda though so I had a nice view of things and a comfortable place to hang out.After the Capitol we toured the Bob Bullock Texas History Museum located close to the Capitol.Thanks to my daughter for sharing her photos with me.  I charged my camera overnight but apparently my battery was \"exhausted\".  I have ordered a new battery.I recently completed \"Tamara's Child\" by B.K. Mayo.  It is an award winning YA novel.I enjoyed this book a great deal -- it was intense, engaging, a bit frightening and rather sad.  For me, it was a page turner.\"Tamara's Child\" is an apt title -- it is the story of Tamara, a troubled teen running from a bad situation into a worse situation which I am sure is not uncommon.  She is pregnant with no place to go until she lands at her step-brother's house.  Her stay there was no walk in the park.  She finds herself in a twisted plot situation and in trouble with the law. Events advance, time passes, and the book ends with Tamara as a middle aged adult coming to terms with her past.I don't want to divulge too much information because this is truly worth the read.  I enjoyed it although it ticked all of my emotions but then, that is probably why I enjoyed it.I recommend this book without reservation."},

Hear it here.1) What are your plans for this Saturday morning? Soon I am going to make a cup of tea and look at laundry.  I may or may not do said laundry but I am going to look at it.  2) In this song, a man sings of going away for the day with a friend. Where did you go on your last day trip? I have no clue.  We don't go on day trips.3) The lyrics say, \"we will remember long after Saturday's gone.\" What's something you've done recently that you predict you'll remember for a long time to come? Well, it isn't really recent but last spring break we went on a road trip with our daughter and granddaughter.  We did Girl Scout badging from here to Savannah, Georgia where we ultimately visited the home of Juliet Gordon Lowe.  This year we are going to do a similar thing here in our home state and will be visiting several spots -- some even I have never been too -- in the quest for more Girl Scout badges and an indepth understanding of Texas history. 4) This song was the Oscar-nominated theme from the movie The Sterile Cuckoo. What's the first movie song that pops into your head?  \"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\" from My Fair Lady.5) In the movie, Liza Minnelli played Mary Ann Adams, an eccentric girl everyone called \"Pookie.\" Have you ever been known by a memorable nickname? Who gave it to you? Hmmm.....my mother tried to call me Missy (short for Melissa) but my dad decided that Messy would work better.  She didn't like that.  So, I was ultimately called Liss -- or Lissie -- or Lissie Lou -- the Liss stuck and it still does. 6) Today's group began their career as The Grads. Recording artist/producer Herb Alpert liked their sound but hated their name. Alpert picked \"sandpiper\" at random out of the dictionary. Do you still have and use a bound dictionary? Or do you rely on the internet for word searches and spelling?  I have several but I tend to use the internet7)The biggest news story of 1969, the year this song was popular, was one of the biggest news stories of all time. On July 20, Neil Armstrong stepped foot on the moon. Other than the moon landing, what's the most consequential event that you've seen in your lifetime. How do you feel it changed America, and the world? The JFK assassination and 9/11.  I don't really know how it made the country as a whole feel but I felt very vulnerable.8)1969 was a big year for music festivals, with Atlanta, Toronto and Woodstock all holding famous fests. Have you visited Georgia, Ontario or New York (state)? I have been to Georgia.  And I loved it.9) Random question -- According to some plant enthusiasts, house plants do better when they're spoken to. Do you talk to your plants? I don't have plants -- I don't do well with them.  I have been thinking about trying though.   Thanks so much for joining us again at Saturday: 9.

{"title": "The Bean and Me Book Club -- Because of Winn Dixie by Kate Di Camillo", "date": "Thursday, February 28, 2019", "text": "My granddaughter is an avid reader.  I am proud of this and thankful for it because it is my belief that if you can read you have the world in your hands. She is now 8 and is reading fairly advanced and sophisticated books (i.e. Harry Potter).  She has asked me to read some of the books that she has found particularly compelling.So, we started the Bean and Me Book Club.  This is how it works.  She reads the books, recommends them to me (and loans them to me sometimes -- the kid has an impressive personal library) and then I read them.Our most recent read is \"Because of Winn Dixie\" by Kate DiCamillo.  I saw the movie years ago and enjoyed it and am really looking forward to starting this book.  I am sure it will be one of those I can't put down and it will probably be a quick read.  It is on my Kindle and I always read faster on the device. The queue is growing and I was told this morning what I will be reading when I am done with this.  It looks like a good variety.  I love that we are able to share this love of reading.I might even start a blog devoted completely to his book club.  I have to think about that.I just finished reading \"The Water Tower Club\" by B.K. Mayo. I discovered this book when it was reviewed on my cousin's blog (mlhalldotcom.blogspot.com).  Michael gave it a very positive review and it sounded like something I would enjoy so I purchased the book for my Kindle.Now, it didn't hurt that the author, B.K. Mayo, was an alumni of my high school that I had met once when Michael married my cousin Joy in San Antonio.  It also didn't hurt that the book had San Antonio ties.  So, forth I charged.The main character of the story is Darryl Coombs, a transplanted San Antonian who was in a rather complicated relationship with Charlotte.  The story revolves around Darryl Coombs returning to his hometown of Grotin to try to save his sister, Libbey, who had, for some unexplainable reason, decided to attack City Councilman Bobby Hobson with a nail file and had been arrested.Along the way, as Darryl tried to uncover the reason for the bizarre attack launched on Bobby by his sister,  he was forced to revisit his difficult youth and come to terms with all the ghosts he had shoved in his the back of his mind. And what did he learn about the attack waged on Bobby?   I am not going to tell you. You will have to  read the book but it is well developed and isn't at all contrived and chock full of secrets as well. As the book progresses he deals with this past demons, gets his sister out of jail, makes amends with this mother and journeys home to San Antonio and to Charlotte, anxious to share his new  feeling of freedom from his past.But, Charlotte isn't there.I am not going to tell you where she is either.  You will have to read the book. I didn't know what to expect when I started this book but I have been very impressed.  It is so well written it just flows well.  So, I purchased another of Mayo's books -- \"Tamara's Child\" and am looking forward to it."},

{"title": "Good Morning, Monday!", "date": "Monday, February 25, 2019", "text": "It is Monday, the sun is shining and all is well in my world --I think.  The Bean is on the mend and destined to return to school today, we have a new clock which is helping Hubs with his sleep inertia -- I think, and we have sunshine and warm temps in our immediate future.  I couldn't be happier.The weekend started with a Girl Scout meeting held in a local park.  The theme of the meeting was \"letter boxing\".  It is sort of like geocaching but without the co-ordinates.  Instead, it used instructions that you get off the internet. It was cold and it was dark and apparently, somewhere just beyond our route was a cow with glowing eyes.  They squealed with delight and \"udder\" fear -- get it?  We were only out there for an hour which was good since most of them had been battling illness and didn't need to be out in the damp, foggy weather.They were cold and scared but they had so much fun.Yesterday we spent at our other house doing some cleaning and getting ready to meet with our realtor.  Finally.  I have some observations about it that only come with age.I grew up in post WW2 housing that had 8 ft. ceilings in the rooms, hardwood floors, tile kitchen counters and bathrooms and bathtubs that would not be confused with a swimming pool.  My mother was very short -- 5'1\" -- and all she had to do was stand on a kitchen chair to change a light bulb.Young people, when buying houses today, should recognize that they won't always be young and agile and they should assess whether what they are buying is going to be \"do-able\" when they aren't young anymore.My poor husband was on a step stool and almost on the bathroom vanity to change out the light bulbs in the fixtures. One of those handy dandy gadgets that allows you to stand on the floor and grab the light bulb won't work in these small fixtures.  So, with his diabetic neuropathy, his arthritic hip and knees, there he was teetering around trying to put in a light bulb.I climbed into the 18 inch deep jacuzzi tube (that I have always hated) to clean it out and I couldn't get back out again.  Climbing in was easy compared to climbing out.  The tub is a two person affair (laughable) and it is almost  impossible to clean by just wiping down.  I can no longer get on my knees to do that sort of thing and even if I could, my arms are too short to stretch across because it is a corner unit.  This doesn't address the massive glass shower enclosure that has to be cleaned constantly because of the lime scale.  I know my mother complained about tile and cleaning grout and she was thrilled when formica became vogue.  I agree with the grout issue but I am not thrilled with the granite/marble used today either.  In my bathrooms at the other house there is black marble.  We have hard water.  It is impossible for water marks to not show up on that black marble.  Granite takes a lot of care and the pattern we have doesn't allow you to see anything that might be stuck on it.  You have to clean by touch.  My current home has formica in the kitchen and honestly, while not as fancy and impressive, I love it.The floors in the \"old\" house are travertine marble which is very easy care and looks lovely but it has done a terrible number on my arthritis and is contributory to my current condition.  But, it looks impressive.So, as I prepare this house to sell I am thinking longingly of those 1950's houses that were so simple and easy to take care of.  When we bought the house 14 years ago, it was advertised as being a community of garden homes, minimal care, perfect for retirees and empty nesters.  Well, it is a garden home community and they (the HOA) Do do the yard but as far as that minimal care -- not so much.So, youngsters, if you can fast forward yourselves to an older, yet still awesome version of you (look at your parents or grandparents) make wise choices or one day you will be longing for a simple little bungalow with a plain bathtub and shower curtain and light fixtures you can maintain without having to hire somebody to do it.Jumping off the soap box now.  Oh, wait, not jumping -- more like hobbling."},

{"title": "Conundrum and Quandry", "date": "Sunday, February 10, 2019", "text": "Yes, it is a conundrum and a quandry -- our home life is all wonky, no routine, no schedule and no groceries.I don't like to cook or grocery shop.  With all the delivery services, shopping shouldn't be a problem these days and I really should try one but with a major grocery store walking distance from my house, well, it seems sort of silly, doesn't it? I don't like to cook.  Well, that isn't completely true.  I do like to cook but I am a plain cook and I like plain food and I like vegetables.  The man of the house, however, doesn't.  We have been married 46 years and he doesn't like my cooking.  I don't think he ever has.  It is rather disheartening to stand up on my gimpy, painful knees and cook a meal only to throw most of his away fifteen minutes later and watch him get up and make a snack.We have also gotten to the age that eating a noon meal is more appealing than a heavy evening meal.  Neither of us seems to digest well anymore and that makes us very grumpy and we don't sleep well.So, a couple of weeks ago I quit.  I told Mr. that I wasn't cooking anymore.  That we would just eat out and we would eat lunch and he could choose.  I just didn't care anymore.  I don't really have much of an appetite anymore -- I think it is due to a med I am taking -- and you would think I wouldn't have a weight problem but I do.  So, since he doesn't like what I fix, I doubt he would like what eatery I would choose so it is all on him.That has been our routine for two weeks.  I haven't been to the grocery store either.  Is that bad? It is when the weather is dreadful and you don't want to go out to the restaurants!  There is nothing in this house to eat.  So, I am re-thinking the whole thing.While I am not crazy about getting out of bed and starting lunch, I know people used to do just that.  Maybe I should cook ahead but that means \"leftovers\" which Mr.'s delicate palate can't seem to handle.  Maybe I should just bundle up and head out. I have no clue.  How could two people who have lived together the majority of their lives be so different?  It is a mystery.But, in other non-whining news, I have been making cards again.  Here are a few of my latest creations. Every time I make a card I sit back and look at what it looks like and how I could have made it better.  The little koala needs more background \"stuff\" and I will probably remake it with more \"stuff\" but I think he is cute, just the same.  The teacup mice -- well, those just went really tacky really quickly but I think the recipients will like them anyway.  The music inspired one was pretty much copied from one on pinterest (I think) -- thank you whoever did it for the inspiration because sometimes the creative part of my brain is like a dried up desert. So, yeah, that has been my week -- hoping this one starts out better."},

Mayo and it is turning into a real page turner.  I will review when I am finished.I have also found myself part of a very unlikely book club consisting of two members -- me and the Bean.Bean is an avid reader and has advanced to the likes of Harry Potter and similiar things.  She reads a good deal, at a good pace, and enjoys an advanced level of enjoyment.Lately she has been sharing her books with me.  I am not a Harry Potter fan, I don't think, I have never been interested in starting the books but maybe I should check them out.However, we are now reading \"TheCricket in Times Square\" by George Selden.  It is about Chester Cricket who has been adopted as a pet by Mario Bellini.  Mama Bellini doesn't like Chester but Papa Bellini has a soft spot for the little insect.  Chester and Mario have great adventures, like visiting Chinatown, and it is really quite the engaging little book.  Written in 1960 it won the Newberry Honor Award in 1961.  The illustrations are by my all time favorite illustrator, Garth Williams.The next book in the queue is \"Because of Winn Dixie\" by Kate DiCamillo.  It was published in 2000 and won the Newberry Honor award in 2001.  In 2000 it won the Josette Frank award and in 2003 it won the Mark Twain award.Bean has finished the book already and I have yet to start.  She said it was amazing although it had a sad patch, but got better as it neared the end.  I remember watching the movie but don't remember the details.  I am sure the book is better and I will be starting it shortly. I am very thankful that Bean loves to read and that she likes a wide variety of books.  She reminds me of me as a child and I might recommend the next book -- \"The Good Master\" by Kate Seredy -- one of my favorites as a child. I remember visiting the library and checking out the books in this series and I distinctly remember curling up on the couch and reading it through as it rained slow, steady, and abundantly as it is want to do in San Antonio.  Such a good book.  I hope she likes it as well.I am quite happy with my little book club.  It suits me!"},
{"title": "Mayhem and Matrimony by Hope Callaghan", "date": "Wednesday, February 06, 2019", "text": "I just finished reading book #11 in the \"Made in Savannah\" cozy mystery series by Hope Callaghan.It is the latest in the ongoing story of the Garlucci family who moved from New York to Savannah to escape their \"family\" connections. Carlita Garlucci, the main character, is always finding her way into some sort of an uncomfortable situation with some mystery to solve.And she is getting really good at it.With a cast of secondary characters -- Mercedes, Shelby, Violet, Elvira, Reese, and the Garlucci boys -- there is always a lot of activity and close calls.These are great little books -- murder mysteries, yes, Mafia connections, yes, but there is nothing off putting about them.  They are very sterile and just a lot of fun.I definitely recommend."},

Montgomery.  I don't know how I went so long without reading it -- or why. Anne Shirley, the lead character, has red hair, a precocious personality and just manages to vex people while simultaneously wrapping them around her little finger.I was drawn into this novel from the get go.  So much so, actually, that I did some research on Prince Edward Island so I could have a good picture of the setting although it was well described in the book.I don't usually cry over books but I did shed a few with this one. I believe I will continue with the series."},
{"title": "Hygge, Lagom and Cwtch ---oh my!", "date": "Saturday, January 26, 2019", "text": "For the last two or three years people have been enchanted by the lifestyle concept of Hygge.  It is Danish in origin an embraces a cozy environment using lots of cozy linens and candles to create the correct ambiance.  The look is generally light walls, light wood, uncluttered interiors to ward off the dark of the long winters.  It is almost minimalistic.I am not minimalistic so while I like the look, it isn't me.The next new thing is lagom.  It is Swedish in origin an means \"not too little, not too much, just enough\".  That sounds more like me.  I can't be minimal because I like things around me that have meaning.  I don't like clutter, though, so this sounds like it would be more up my alley.So, I decided to go to my own ancestral background and discover what sort of lifestyle the folks in my ancestral home (one of them) find to be appealing.Enter \"cwtch\" -- rhymes with \"butch\".  It is Welsh for a hug and also a cubby or cubbyhole -- a cozy place, a safe place if you will.  So, when you apply this word to interior design it means cozy and warm.  There is no direct English translation for this word, by the way.Apparently there is no one style or color scheme or plan, you simply surround yourself with what makes you feel like you are in a cozy, safe place.  One article said to include lots of family photos.  Another article said to use lots of natural colored linens, different colored woods, create a cozy reading nook, and common family eating area.And they also said not to forget the Welsh cakes! And a Welsh dresser!Yes, that sounds more like me -- I think my house is already \"cwtch\"."},

{"title": "Channeling Marie", "date": "Monday, January 14, 2019", "text": "Yesterday was a non-day.  What do I mean?  I mean it was like I was invisible.  I didn't do anything.  Well, I did a bunch of laundry but that is mindless.  I didn't do anything that required much energy or intellect at all.  I didn't feel well, my knees hurt, the weather was icky and my allergies were making their presence known so I sat and watched movies. I watched a lovely little anti-drug film made in 1936 by the title \"Marahuana\".  It was the most dismal thing I have ever seen.  Why did you watch it you ask?  Curiosity.  And you know how they say \"curiosity killed the cat\"?  Yes.  Yes, it does.Then I watched \"A Kiss Before Dying\" with Robert Wagner and Joanne Woodward.  It was typical 50's fare with a nice little twist. Then I moved on to \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" with the ever gorgeous Hugh Grant.  I had to turn it off though because my grandchildren arrived.  With their arrival we went on to finish \"Moana\" which I really hope to not have to watch again for awhile and when we were done there we started the 1951 version of \"Alice in Wonderland\". After the kids left we were on our own for pizza and more tv.  However, I continued reading on THE book.  It is not uncommon for me to think books start out slowly and then reach a point of not being put down but this was went on almost three quarters of the way before I could say it got interesting.  It is moving along at a better clip now and I am more than ready. So, today I have tackled the beast known as my closet.  The closet, well, my side of it, looks as though a little hurricane has gone through it.  So, I have decided to fix it.  Now the whole bedroom looks like a hurricane has gone through it.  I have a ton of blouses that I don't wear because they all have to be ironed -- a lot -- with lots of starch to even look like I have touched them.  Marie Kondo says to hold an item in your hand and see if it sparks joy.  Is she kidding?  These blouses don't spark joy! They are just wrinkled!  So, don't know what I am going to do about that -- probably donate.  And then shop.  Fun?  No.  I don't like shopping.I have a chest in the closet that I am moving upstairs for craft storage.  I need the hanging room it is taking up.  I really prefer to hang things so Marie and I don't really agree on that.  I folded a bunch of stuff her way, once, and promptly forgot I had it.  However, once I opened the drawer I put it in it was like Christmas but, yeah, I have to be able to see my stuff.So, that is what I am doing today.  Waiting for the warm up they said was coming today but they have now bumped it to Wednesday.  Oh well, it is January.Guess I will go back to the closet.  Fun!"},
{"title": "Been Away", "date": "Saturday, January 12, 2019", "text": "Been away for a few days.  Not really \"away\" but away from the computer.  I have been trying to un-device myself and spend some time doing other things.  I really love being on the computer but I feel like I need a break sometimes.I have been making moves to re-do my closet.  I think I am going to have to employ Marie Kondo's approach to tidying up-- holding an item in my hand and if it sparks joy, keep it -- if not, don't.  I have a feeling none of my blouses that need heavy ironing are going to spark any joy for me.  I might have a lot going to the charity shop.I also spent a little time cleaning up my craft area.  I have a few cards to make and it was to the point, after Christmas, that I couldn't see the table top.  The Hubs has ordered me a new table for crafting and I hope it gets here soon.  I need to do something about storage but I have some ideas. Still reading THE book -- almost done -- really, I am.  I have been taking a break and reading \"Twenty Seven Years on the Texas Frontier\" by William Banta.  William Banta is an ancestor of mine -- my great-grandfather's uncle of some number of \"greats\".  It is an interesting account of his time here and what it was like in the early to mid-1800's.  I love the mention of the areas that I am familiar with as modern sites. The weather has turned cold and icky.  It was quite rainy yesterday but it dried up today and we did quite a bit of moving of stuff from our other house.  There is very little stuff left there and we are almost ready to market the house.  It will be the fourth or fifth on the market in the neighborhood.  I don't know if that will be good or not -- it will create more traffic in the area but then there are more to choose from.  Guess we will see what happens.Not much to speak of -- not much going on.  Girl Scout cookie season has begun and I hope our girls do well.  I think they will.So, I guess I will go watch this Dallas Cowboy football game -- I really don't like pro football."},

{"title": "January 5,2019", "date": "Saturday, January 05, 2019", "text": "Today is the last day of Christmas.  Tomorrow is Epiphany.  It was a wonderful season.However, things are getting back to normal whether we want them to or not.  I didn't post yesterday because I had some errands to run and by the time I was done I was pooped and I crashed.Today was spent going to our old house and taking things to the donation place.  We didn't get much done but I am hobbling around and not much help.  We are at that point that we sort of need to just throw it all away, all the little stuff that is left.  It is time.I have spent the day thinking about clothing and how our lives change our needs.  I don't need to remind anybody who has been here for a while, that I am having arthritis issues that now are complicated by ankle issues.  So, I did some looking at shoes-- yes, orthopedic shoes -- it hurts to say that, yes, it really does.  Especially since I have a Tieks mind!  But, I did order a pair of rather homely shoes called Sanibel by Orthofeet.  I would show you a photo but it seems they won't let me copy it.  Anyway, we will see how they work.  I suspect that part of my problem is that I insist upon wearing shoes with absolutely no support.  But, isn't it all about the cuteness factor?  No?  Oh.So, all the shoe shopping let me think about my clothes.  I don't wear heels anymore but I do wear cute flats.  I wear lots of slacks and jeans.  I have a problem with tops because t-shirts aren't my \"thing\" -- I much prefer shirts or blouses.  So, I follow a blog that will remain nameless and the lady has good advice -- if you are very small and very rich -- which I am neither.  So, I was sort of devising my own take on her advice.Then, I happened upon another blog giving an idea of what sort of things, in what amount does one need to create a reasonable \"wardrobe\".   I do know what \"works\" for me, what I wear repeatedly and what I find comfortable so I think I should start there.I no longer like prints in tops.  I much prefer solids in whites, blues or grays.  I like things tailored and I like colorful jewelry and accessories.  However, with that said, about the only purse I carry anymore is a Longchamp tote in gray or red.  They are so fantastic -- and they zip! A necessity for people like me who tend to drop things.  Here is one similar I also did some looking at makeup a few days ago.  I miss mainstream makeup since I have been using \"natural\" makeup for several years now.  I was drooling over the Clinique website when I noticed that all their products are paraben free now.  I dumped my entire makeup drawer, headed for Ulta and bought all new makeup.  I don't use foundation anymore and I do use Thrivecausmetic mascara so I bought some blush, eye shadow and lip balm all in the chubby stick line.  I love it.  And now my makeup drawer is clean.So, I am making a move to do the same thing with the closet.  I have a good list of what I need to make a good wardrobe for myself --and I don't really need to buy much except a couple of blouses.   What I need to do is get rid of what I don't wear hanging up.  I have a bunch of shirts that I bought a while back and they are all way, WAY, too big.  I just didn't bother to send them back.  My bad.  But they are all a hopeless wrinkly mess and have to be ironed with lots of steam and lots of spray starch and I just don't think I can continue with them very well.  So, the closet is getting a good clean out.  I wish I could consider it fun but I don't.  Oh well, I will like it better when there is only stuff in there that I will wear. So, yeah.  That is how my year is starting out.  Trying to be productive.  Trying to finish that book!  One day I will and you will all be surprised!"},

(Hopefully not!) A comedy or romance?  It will be fun to watch the book write itself and revisit this first page on December 31, 2019.As I have said before, my Advent was superb, my Christmas a blessed time like no other before and here I am headed toward Epiphany with a fresh sense of renewal and purpose looking forward to all the new year has in store for me. My thought for the new year?  To let the year be what it is meant to be, look at the new day and know it is a gift and be thankful for it.I have a few plans for the year.  I mentioned before that I have been doing morning devotionals using a book called \"Jesus Calling\".  There is an entry for each day of the year and I am beginning at the beginning today.  I like the way it feels to start my day with a devotional reading.  It just sets the day off on the right foot.  This is a lovely little book if you would like to check it out -- I have it on my Kindle.I am still reading \"Mrs. Lincoln's Dressmaker \" and not enjoying it one bit more than I was two days ago.  I am determined to finish it though.  I have a stack of reads piling up on my bedside table though that I am anxious to get to.  I have never been very successful at trying to read more than one book at a time but as slow as this one is going I might have to try. I believe that my first book started in 2019 is going to be \"Anne of Green Gables\".  It is a title I should have read years ago and didn't so I am playing catch-up.  Also, there is a new title out in the Made in Savannah series that I am just itching to start.The new year is going to find me cooking more.  In our house, everybody seems to want a couple of dishes -- \"I don't know\" and \"I don't care\" -- and I can't find recipes for those particular dishes so I am planning to make the decision of what we will be having.  I mean, since I am the one having to cook it, I should be able to decide what I want to spend my time doing --right?  I think so.I will be continuing to make cards in the upcoming year.  I am on a couple of cardmaking groups on FB and there has been mention of people being concerned about recipients tossing the cards and how that hurts their feelings.  I think differently about it.  In the first place, nobody has room to store everything that comes into their homes and some things have to be thrown or recycled just out of practicality.  I make these cards because I feel the need to be artistic -- seems I inherited my father's drive and inclination toward art but not the talent.  That is a conundrum.  So, making cards is a creative outlet for me.  It is fun for me.  It is thought provoking to design and choose papers and stamps and such and I get a kick out of it.  If the people I send them to like them, that is the cherry on the top, isn't it?  If they decide to dispose of them, well, it is their card once it is in their hands.  My fun has been had.  So, I will continue with the hobby until I tire of it.Last week was such fun.  I had the privilege of viewing \"The Return of Mary Poppins\" with my daughter and granddaughter.  I think the Hubs and I should go to the movie more. I miss it.  It used to be our main activity when we were dating and after we married we just became homebodies.  Admittedly, with all the offerings now on TV with streaming and such, there is little need to venture to a theater but once in a while it would be nice.I don't believe in resolutions.  I see resolutions as something to be broken.  I do believe in seeing better ways to do things and making the effort to embrace new approaches but the idea of feeling like I have \"failed\" if I slip just doesn't appeal to me -- so there are no resolutions.  However, Advent has taught me a lot -- how to relax, how to be quiet, how to prioritize, how to be happy with \"enough\", how to weigh needs and wants and how gratitude is the most wonderful feeling.  For some reason, this holiday season has been a real learning curve for me and I am so thankful for whatever it is that has molded my thinking for the last couple of months.  It has been eye opening. So, here is to a new, happy, prosperous year to all of you!  I am looking forward to reading about all of your new years as well."},

I read an article this morning about how it is going to take more than \"put Christ back in Christmas\" to get back to the real meaning of Christmas.It talked  about how Christmas was banned in Early America.  It talked about the commercialization of the season.  It talked about how the modern day Santa came to be and how it is a big part of American culture now.It was a sad article.  But, it was an eye opener.  I am really glad we \"do\" Advent in this house.With that said, I am tired.  My daughter is having a medical \"procedure\" tomorrow and, while I am not worried, it is on my mind.  I also have the Bean for the night and I have to get her to school and then go back three hours later for her Christmas party.  I made goody bags for her classmates but it seems a good number of them are either going to be gone for Christmas visits elsewhere or they are throwing up.I have no words.So, I have to deliver those and teacher gifts and make sure she doesn't eat any nut laced cookies.  Parties are just a little nerve wracking.  I will be glad when it is over..What did I do today?  Laundry.  Hubs was under the weather so we didn't do anything but make a run to the bank.  I cooked dinner and made a couple of cards.  I am trying to get all my laundry caught up because I would like to start a new plan to keep things up and done. \"The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry\".  Ah, yes.  We shall see.So, I am off to hang up wet uniforms, wash my hair, put somebody to bed and probably collapse.  There is a reason God gives children to young women.Goodnight."},

When I read that I felt as if I was being wrapped in a big, minky blanket.  It goes on to say \"Feel the warmth and security of being enveloped in my loving Presence.  Every detail of your life is under My control.  Moreover, everything fits into a pattern for good, to those who love me and are called according to My design and purpose.\"  Wow.If you can acquire one of these books, either a physical book or an electronic book, it is a great start to the day.Because I have changed my approach to Christmas this year I have a lot more time to enjoy some of the programming.  Last night I watched the Darci Lynn special.  Remember she was the little puppeteer from America's Got Talent.  She is only about 13 years old but she has a voice that, in my opinion, rivals other young singers like Brenda Lee.  The show was enjoyable and I loved hearing her sing \"Mary Did You Know\".

His reputation evolved among the faithful, as was common for early Christian saints, and his legendary habit of secret gift-giving gave rise to the traditional model of Santa Claus (\"Saint Nick\") through Sinterklaas.  So, yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.In the parochial schools here it is a very common practice for the children, on December 6, to put a shoe in hallway and sometime during the day the shoe is filled with goodies. This is what it looked like today. And then, at home, there was thisWhat a great way to enjoy that candy cane that was left in the shoe."},

{"title": "Tis the Season and All That Jazz", "date": "Monday, November 26, 2018", "text": "I always loved the Christmas season. I grew up in the South but our weather was always seasonal enough that we could enjoy Thanksgiving and Christmas appropriately.Then, I grew up and had children and suddenly Christmas became really stressful. Why?  I don't know.  I think there was always so much to do that I became overwhelmed easily.  That happens to me a lot.  But, instead of dialing back and repacing myself I forged ahead and suffered a huge burnout.Then there were the years with sick and failing parents.  There were years that they were either sickly or hospitalized or not with us anymore and I would be lying if I said that didn't impact our holidays.  We were a small family and when things started happening, huge holes were left -- we didn't have a ton of brothers and sisters and kids to fill the void.  And the void just got bigger and I didn't care anymore.Grandchildren came along and that helped but there were issues there as well and sometimes the holidays weren't nearly as much fun as I had hoped.Last year we moved to a new house, promptly got the flu and bam, Christmas was on top of us and I was done.  I didn't even send cards.  I had a really bad case of the bah-humbugs.  I was actually glad when it was over and I could just sit down and try to get well -- that little bout of flu, while not severe, seemed to hang on a long time.Fast forward to this year.  After last year I decided to rethink the whole thing and re-evaluate my expectations.  I think I have come to terms with decorating and shopping and over-doing.  I have two children, two in-law children and four grandchildren.  They are all difficult to buy for.  For a long time I gave my son and son in law socks as a gag gift.  That's how bad it is.  The girls are picky.  That's ok.  The children -- well, I don't like to compete with parents and Santa.  So, I just decided, without apology, that I am gifting them with money.  Problem solved.  Do I feel bad about it?  Absolutely not.  The kids are all big enough to want to shop and maybe they don't want to shop right then, maybe they will want something later.  Maybe they will hate it but for me, it works.My decorating is done and the gifts are decided.  Food will be what the food always is so I feel, for the first time in a LONG time that I have a handle on it.So, I went grocery shopping today.  It isn't my favorite chore (I don't have a favorite chore-- they are all chores).  But, I realized that I was singing to the music (Jingle Bell Rock) and I was looking at all the things that my mother used to buy (cordial cherries, specifically) and I felt like it was 1965 again, I was in HEB and I was in my happy place.  It was major deja vu and I felt so good and free and happy.  It was like the Christmas's of my youth.  I can still feel it.So, if I get all down again, I guess all I have to do is go to the grocery store!"},

I glanced behind me and it was a rather tall, nicely dressed lady.  I apologized for being in the way and slow and she struck up a conversation.We chatted about getting \"old\" which she clearly wasn't -- I would say early 40's but it was hard to tell, maybe younger.  It was a nice chat as she walked along with me to my car.  I assumed she was getting in the car next to mine as she walked with me all the way to the car.As I turned to open my door and get in the car, she asked if she could pray for my knees.  It was then that I looked at her, REALLY looked at her.  She was tall, slender, dark complected with short hair.  She had a beautiful face and really beautiful eyes.  I am not one to look people in the eye, really, especially people I don't know but I couldn't help myself, her eyes were really pretty.So, anyway, she asked if she could pray for my knees and I said sure, I could use all the help that I could get and she asked me my name.  I told her Melissa and she said \"ok, Miss Melissa, I will pray for you\".  I asked her her name and she looked at me, with the enthusiasm of a little child and said, with a big grin and a look of joy-- \"my name is Autumn Joy\".  I guess I can imagine somebody naming a child Autumn Joy -- not different than naming December babies things like Merry Carol and Noel.  However, it seemed almost contrived--like she just thought it up.I thanked her and we parted ways -- I fully expected her to get in the car next to me but she didn't.  She turned around and walked back into the store.  It was then that it occurred to me that she didn't have a handbag, a name tag, any sort of identification linking her to the store.  It was just her. I wasn't afraid of her, I felt quite at peace talking to her, I didn't feel that the situation was odd until after it was over and I thought about it.Who was this  person?  What was she doing?  Where did she come from?  I will probably never know -- I haven't been back to the store so I don't know if she is an employee there or not.  I have no clue.So, thoughts?"},
{"title": "Saturday 9", "date": "Saturday, November 24, 2018", "text": "Wednesday, November 21, 2018Black Magic WomanWelcome to Saturday: 9. What we've committed to our readers is that we will post 9 questions every Saturday. Sometimes the post will have a theme, and at other times the questions will be totally unrelated. Those weeks we do \"random questions,\" so-to-speak. We encourage you to visit other participants posts and leave a comment. Because we don't have any rules, it is your choice. We hate rules. We love memes, however, and here is today's meme!Saturday 9: Black Magic Woman (1970)Unfamiliar with this week's tune: Hear it here.  1) Black is this week's signature color because Friday, November 23, was \"Black Friday,\" when retailers cut their prices and consumers flock to the stores. Did you score any \"Black Friday\" bargains?No, I don't \"do\" black Friday.  I did go to Hobby Lobby to get antlers and a reindeer nose for my car but they were out.  So, I bought a box to store my paper cutting dies in and I had a 40% off coupon.  2) On busy shopping days,  carts often litter parking lots. After loading your items into your car, are you careful to return your shopping cart to the store or the designated cart receptacle? We routinely park next to the cart return place so we always put it back. 3) Who on your gift list is hardest to buy for? Everybody --that is why we give the gift that fits all tastes and sizes and almost everybody likes green. 4) Feasting and football are also popular Thanksgiving weekend pastimes. Do your Thursday-Sunday plans include enjoying leftovers or watching a game? No leftovers this year because we ate away from home but football -always.  Big Texas A&M fans, here, Gig 'em, Aggies! Whoop! 5) Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade is an annual event. It began in 1924 as a local event in New York. Today it's nationally televised. Did you watch it? For the first time in my life I sat down and watched the whole thing through.   6) What did you give thanks for on Thanksgiving 2018? My health, my family, their health, the weather, just life in general -- it is a blessing. 7) At the first Thanksgiving, there were no forks. Pilgrims ate with spoons and knives, and forks didn't become popular until the 18th century. Think about your Thanksgiving place setting. Did you have both a salad and a dinner fork?    no 8) Pies are a popular Thanksgiving dessert. What kind of pie did you enjoy? Or did you have ice cream? Or did you skip dessert?Pumpkin pie   9) This week's featured band, Santana, was named for its founder, Carlos Santana. He was born in Mexico. When at a Mexican restaurant, what do you usually order?Last  night at Baha I had chicken tinga street tacos.  At our usual place, Mi Cocula, I have been getting a plate called La Condesa -- it is chicken with spinach and mushrooms in a creme sauce.  Very nice.  Thanks so much for joining us again at Saturday: 9. As always, feel free to come back, see who has participated and comment on their posts. In fact sometimes, if you want to read & comment on everyone's responses, you might want to check back again tomorrow. But it is not a rule. We haven’t any rules here. Join us on next Saturday for another version of Saturday: 9, \"Just A Silly Meme on a Saturday!\"Well, Thanksgiving is almost a memory now and Christmas is quickly approaching.We had a nice Thanksgiving.  We had dinner at our son's home and it was a nice evening.  No leftovers, but that is ok because we always get tired of the food quickly.  Our daughter and her family took the week to vacation at Disney and I am so glad they did.  It sounds like they had a lovely time and we really enjoyed the daily photos.  We are also glad they are home safe and sound.Over the week, since there was no huge cooking going on, we decided to put up our Christmas village and pull things together for the holidays.  It is lovely.We chose not to put up a big tree this year -- we don't have room with the village -- it is one or the other and since we really don't buy gifts anymore (they all prefer money) then I don't need a tree to put packages under.  This works well for us. I have been making holiday cards this year and have been having a good time of it.  I have a few more to make and then will start mailing them out.  One I will mail this week because it is going overseas and I want it to get there. So, it has been a quiet week and a productive week.  I am looking forward to going into Advent next week (Dec. 2) and the quiet time that goes along with. I am glad we put the decor up already so we can just enjoy the serenity of the season."},
{"title": "Diolch", "date": "Friday, November 23, 2018", "text": "Good morning! Today, here in the US, is Black Friday -- the day after Thanksgiving, the retail day that causes people to run amok shopping \"fantastic deals\" to obtain lots of material goods -- after spending a day being thankful for all they already have.  It is laughably sad.I don't participate in Black Friday.  There is nothing in the world I want bad enough to fight the crowds of people who are overtired, haven't digested the food from yesterday and are generally disagreeable. Not my idea of a good time.However, I do want a set of antlers and a Rudolph nose for my car.  I saw them a few days ago and passed on them, now I want them, but I will wait until the crowds are down -- or maybe tomorrow -- to see if there are any left.  If there aren't, I can certainly do without. If I get them I will post a photo -- and one of the embarrassed hubby who doesn't understand why his ancient wife would want to dress up the car.  I can't explain. Anyway, I started out this morning reading blogs like I always do and there were several from my British friends concerning Thanksgiving.  One, in particular, brought my mind around to gratitude.  I remembered that I had started a gratitude blog a while back -- quite a while back -- and I decided to resurrect it and make short entries each day as to what I found to be grateful for.  Full disclosure, this will be a religious faith based blog so if that isn't something you might be interested in you might just want to pass.  However, I feel compelled to write this blog for myself, to remind myself of all that I have been given and if it is helpful to anybody else, then so be it.I have already written a post today and I invite you to visit Diolch -- loosely translated Welsh for \"gratitude\" -- I think.  Diolch won't be  discussed here -- two different focuses and two different vibes but I am using this time and this place to invite you to visit Diolch if you so desire. There is a link down the side of this page.So, with that said, I am going to start my day by finishing picking up from the Christmas decorating and get read to go hunt for those antlers/nose! Wish me luck."},
{"title": "These Is My Words by Nancy E Turner", "date": "Wednesday, November 14, 2018", "text": "\"These is My Words-- the diary of Sarah Agnes Prine -- 1881-1901\" -- a fictional piece based on the family history of the author Nancy E. Turner.It is the story of Sarah Prine, a spirited woman who grows up and comes of age on the frontier.  During the course of the book she goes from an uneducated child to an educated adult and from a young woman finding her way in spite of loss and turbulence to a loving mother and wife of cavalry captain John Elliot.I enjoyed this book but it was rough and harsh and didn't gloss over any of the events that occurred during those times in those places to countless people.  It was happy and sad and a struggle.It made me glad I live in my time. I recommend as long as you realize that it is a tough book to read."},
{"title": "Gotta Love Texas Weather", "date": "Sunday, November 11, 2018", "text": "October is my favorite month.  However, somehow I missed it this year.  We were still having summer in October so I was indoors a lot.  It finally felt like fall fell on Halloween.  It got chilly.It is now November 11 and we are in winter.  We have been near our first freeze.  The weather man was saying something silly like \"stray flurries\" on Monday.  So, it appears we have had about 10 days of fall.   Bother.So, between the time change and the weather, I have been a bit out of sorts.  Allergies kicking up, joints aching, just sort of blah.  I haven't been getting much of anything done but I have been playing with card making.Here are a few of my recent efforts.  I was trying to design a card for a small boy who is at St. Jude's for about six weeks receiving radiation for a tumor.  It is a difficult thing to think about making for a child -- get well cards can be so -- depressing.  So, I decided not to make a get well card -- I did something different.Tell me what you think. Then I didn't know if it was too bland and not colorful enough so I made this one. And then I saw an anniversary card similar to this one and I made it just to compare.I love the stamp set and it is easy and fun which I thought \"fun\" was exactly what the little boy needs.So, I am probably going to send the first one.  I am thinking that I am going to send one once a week until he is home so I need to come up with some more ideas.  I have some cute digi stamps that I love to color so that may be my next project.I will share whatever I do -- card makingis very therapeutic and a bit humbling.  I have two new \"toys\", if you will, a stamp positioner and an envelope maker.  Well, yesterday after hours of sitting and coloring and cutting and gluing I decided to play with my new toys.  I couldn't get either of them to work and was so disgusted.  I was tired and tired of sitting so I just closed everything up and left the room.  After a few videos on you tube and a couple of embarrassing \"ohhhhhh\" moments I realized that the toys were not at fault but rather operator error.  See what I mean about humbling. So, today is a new day and I will approach this activity with new knowledge.  I have some ideas!  I will share later."},

{"title": "Thoughts About Genealogy -- How Much is Enough?", "date": "Monday, October 22, 2018", "text": "I dabble in all sorts of things, none of it very well but I am diligent.  One of my pursuits has been my working on my family tree.  Family history has always been a popular \"thing\" in my father's side of the family.  The family was fairly historic and it was something the family was very proud of.  There really wasn't a whole lot of research to do as it was pretty much already done, I just had to add to it a bit.My mother's side was a different story and back in the late 80's she decided she would like to know more about her family so off I go to \"discover\" her roots.It hasn't been easy but with I knew a few snippets of information and with the help of some distant cousins I learned a bit more and was gifted with some old photos.The person I started with was my great-grandmother who was born in Cinderford, Gloucestershire, England.  She moved with her family to Wales when she was about 9 years old and then, as an adult with children of her own she immigrated to the US.  My grandmother lived with my g-grandmother at one time and she told me a few things about her.The one thing that I learned about my great-grandmother (she had a  name, it was Dinah) was that she was very religious and refused to be photographed.  So, you can imagine how surprised I was when my cousin sent me three photos of great-grandmother Dinah.   Well, I felt I had to share with other members of the family.So, long story short Dinah has been copied, mailed, emailed, put on Ancestry.com and put on facebook and I can honestly say I feel awful about it.  We all wanted to know our foremother but have we all been terribly disrespectful of her wishes and beliefs? I feel she would be appalled at the whole thing if she knew and she would probably hate us all! So, how far is too far to go with genealogy?  At what point does the research and sharing become an invasion of privacy? If the person is deceased does it really matter anymore?  I worry about things like this.Personally, in the case of Dinah, I think we have overstepped the line."},
{"title": "Apologies", "date": "Sunday, October 21, 2018", "text": "Yesterday I  posted about wishing people would comment when they visit my blog.  Then, today, I set out to do my daily blog reading (yes, I really DO do it every day) and it became glaringly apparent that I was visiting and not commenting! Talk about awkward!So, I set out to make it right and I decided that if I visit a blog, I will make a comment, even if it is only \"hi\".I need to be more thoughtful.My bad.I am back to making cards and delivered my granddaughter's birthday card and I dropped off their Halloween cards to be given to them by their mother so I didn't have to worry about remembering to mail them.  I still need to deliver Bean's.  I went shopping for some card making supplies today and am very put out with the selection as it is very meager.  Hobby Lobby is still the best place for stamps and dies and ink.  However, I did stop into Wal-Mart and bought two packages of card stock.  One was Neenah that is recommended and the other was Georgia Pacific which is also recommended.  The GP is considerably heavier so I will have to experiment.  I think the Neenah will be used to  print out digi-stamps for coloring.I then went to Michaels with my 50% off coupon and bought a 24 set of Polychromos colored pencils.  I love the look of the copic markers but they are too rich for my blood especially since I don't know how well I would do with them.  And, I like pencils.  So, I hope to do some coloring later on this evening.I purchased a Tim Holtz ruler as well and it is due to be delivered today -- yes, on Sunday -- and I hope it helps me cut things a little straighter.  I have a double astigmatism and sometimes it shows!  It is getting late in the day  and it hasn't arrived yet so not sure if I will see it or not.  Hopefully I do.So, in the future if you see a shy little \"hi\" in your comment section it is just me stopping by for a read.  And, hopefully I will be able to share some more cards here soon."},

Not sure what happened to fall but it seems winter has bullied it's way into our lives a little early.So, I haven't been up to much, really.  Trying to tame the beasts known as Messy House and Moving Boxes.  It appears that I am winning.  It is a slow battle but I am determined.I have been spending a good deal of time in my craft area.  I inherited all of my mother-in-law's art supplies -- and they are plentiful -- as well as my father's supplies -- not quite as plentiful -- but it all needs to be organized and I have been working toward that goal.I have also been  under a lot of stress lately so I have been turning to crafts to help me deal and escape.  I decided, after unpacking lots and lots of craft supplies, to turn back to doing some card making.  The fiddly nature of the  process forces me to concentrate on just that and not on other things.  So, I thought I would share some of the things that I have been doing.I am new to this and I don't pretend to possess the sophisticated skills that many of the card makers possess.  But, it is fun, it satisfies a bit of desire for creativity and it is useful.  So, on I will go -- at least until I use up some of these supplies which will probably take about 25 years."},

What we've committed to our readers is that we will post 9 questions every Saturday. Sometimes the post will have a theme, and at other times the questions will be totally unrelated. Those weeks we do \"random questions,\" so-to-speak. We encourage you to visit other participants posts and leave a comment. Because we don't have any rules, it is your choice. We hate rules. We love memes, however, and here is today's meme! Saturday 9: Unbreak My Heart (1996)Unfamiliar with this week's tune? Hear it here.1) Songs like this are enduringly popular in part because each of us has had our heart broken. Give us the name of a heartbreaker from your own life.There were two -- Charles and Michael.  It is a toss up as to who was the best heartbreaker -- they were both pretty stellar in that department. 2) Toni Braxton sings that \"nights are so unkind.\" What did you do last night? \"Blindspot\" and I surfed the net looking at cardmaking sites. 3) While this song has Toni singing the blues, in real life her love life is happier. Now aged 50, she's engaged and has been sporting a diamond on her left hand. Do you believe that a bride is ever too old to have a big wedding?I think a bride can have whatever sort of wedding she wants.  I had a fairly large wedding but I wanted a small, intimate wedding.  I was quite taken by the description and photos of Barbara Bush's wedding last week -- very nice.  But, I was also taken by the few photos I saw of Princess Eugenie's wedding yesterday -- I loved her dress. 4) Growing up, Toni Braxton's parents severely restricted how much TV their children could watch each day. Ironically, today Toni and her sisters participate in a reality TV show on the WE-TV network, so TV cameras are a big part of their daily adult lives. What TV show do you try not to miss?I always watch \"Days of Our Lives\" and have since 1975.  Recently I have made it a point to never miss \"This is Us\".5) She is prone to dry skin and applies Kiehl's Hand Salve to her hands and arms throughout the day. Tell us about a product you're brand loyal to.I use First Aid Beauty and MooGooUSA 6) Toni admits to being \"a bit of a germaphobe,\" and always maintains a supply of hand sanitizer and wipes. What is always on your shopping list?Not really a germaphobe but I think I should be so I am going to try to remember to carry hand sanitizer with me. 7) While she is not shy about her body, and has worn revealing outfits on the red carpet, Toni Braxton refused a 2011 offer from Hugh Hefner and Playboy to pose nude. What's the last thing you said \"no\" to?Ice cream.  I said no to ice cream.  8) In 1996, the year this song was popular, Mattel introduced a Star Trek Barbie and Ken set. Have you ever fantasized about space travel? Uh,no.9) Random question -- Would you (or did you) invite an ex to your wedding?No.   Thanks so much for joining us again at Saturday: 9.

{"title": "Sometimes I Think I Am Losing My Mind .....", "date": "Monday, October 08, 2018", "text": "I have been going through a bit of a stressful time recently.  My husband is having sleep issues and my mobility has been not- so- good for the last year with a lot of pain and clumsiness.  I am not sleeping well for sure so maybe fatigue is the problem and not that I am getting trippy.However.......We moved into this house just about a year ago.  It is a comfortable house and works well for us even though it needs some work that we are gradually getting done.  It isn't behind a wall with a security gate but I haven't felt unsafe here at all.  I haven't heard odd noises or sensed odd things until the other day -- twice it seems like I have seen something move out of the corner of my eye.  It is like a white blur.  The next day I walked into the bathroom and found a penny laying on the floor.  Finding things on my floor isn't anything new -- I could vacuum and sweep every single day -- but a penny, on the bathroom floor, out of nowhere.  It struck me.Then today the hubs and I were at the neighborhood office supply and I got tired of standing in line so I told him I was going to the car.  I was aware of a person behind me - a female, very attractive and well spoken.  She said hello and asked me how I was and I explained my sore knees and how the weather changing seemed to bother them and we chatted as we walked to my car.  I thought she was going to get in the car next to mine but when I got to my car she asked my name and I told her and she told me hers -- Autumn Joy -- and she asked if she could pray for my knees.  I assured her she could even though I find these sorts of encounters to be awkward but she was so nice and seemed so unthreatening that I wasn't really uncomfortable.  So, she said she would and I thanked her and got in my car completely expecting her to get in the car next to me but she didn't -- she turned around and walked back into the store. It all seemed a bit surreal to me -- she sort of came out of nowhere and seemed to be completely focused on me and our conversation and when it ended she just went back in the store.  I don't think she was a store employee -- I didn't see any signs of that -- and I don't really know where she came from but she made and held eye contact through the whole, short encounter.  It felt very strange, indeed.So......you know what I am thinking, right?"},

I am done.  I love it.  With that said, the skincare routine has been upped which has made such a difference.  I am very comfortable with my decision.I have also morphed into wearing a formula wardrobe.  I read a blog written by a woman who does this and it makes sense.  Of course, she is tiny and attractive (and has also quit wearing makeup -- yes, her blog influenced me) but her approach is very do-able even if you aren't tiny and attractive.  So, my colors are black, white, gray and navy.  Throw in some splashes of turquoise and red (I love to carry a red handbag) and I am good.  But what makes it different for me right now is I am looking for thin t-shirts.  This is new for me.  I normally wouldn't wear something like that but I have a Girl Scout jersey that is thin and it feels so good so I thought......yeah, a new me!That isn't all that has changed.  I am finally taking time, again, to do some of the things I like to do -- like card making!  I finally got all my supplies organized and I sat down to make my oldest granddaughter a birthday card.  She has now reached double digits and likes to dance so this is what I came up with.So, what do you think?  I have another done that I will post at a later date."},

{"title": "I Don't Believe in Hygge", "date": "Monday, September 17, 2018", "text": "Last winter I became aware of the concept of \"hygge\" -- the Danish lifestyle that has no definition but that means cozy, contentment, welcoming.I did some reading about it and the articles I read did create a picture of some ethereal softness and fuzziness and homey-ness.  I don't think that is a real word.Well, this is Texas and as summer came on the idea of wool socks, hot chocolate and a roaring fire went right out the window.  Now we are on the cusp of the seasons changing so I decided to do some reading -- again.  This time I was looking for pictures.Not much out there so I decided to look at some real Danish houses.  I went to some real estate websites and looked for houses for sale in Copenhagen.  And you know what --I only saw two candles.Two.Candles. I also learned that most countries have something like hygge.  They all have their unique ways of being cozy an welcoming.  Heck, there is even \"Texas Hygge\" but it is more about getting through the hellish summers and less about being cozy and cuddly in the winter.So, after exploring some Danish houses I will say -- yes, everything is white.  Danish modern furniture is a real thing.  Everything is very minimal and uncluttered and - well -- Ikea. Was it cozy?  Not to me.  Was it warm.  No, but it was bright which I understand is essential during the Danish winters.  Were there lots of little twinkly candles everywhere?  No.  And no furry pillows but I did see one furry throw.So, I am not sure that I believe in hygge -- I don't think it is any different than what any of the rest of us do during oppressive weather -- it is just a way to make the unpleasant pleasant.I am going to try burning more candles though.  LED candles -- for safety -- but I am going to see how \"cozy\" I can get.Yes, I know -- the houses were staged for sale so the realtor probably told the owners to get those candles all packed up so it wouldn't look cluttered.I watch HGTV!"},

We love memes, however, and here is today's meme!Saturday 9: Teenage Dream (2010)Unfamiliar with this week's tune? Hear it here.1) Much of the video for this week's song takes place in a convertible and on the beach. How's the weather where you are? Would you be comfortable riding around with the top down today? It has cooled down considerably but it is humid and rainy thanks to a tropical disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico 2) This video was filmed all around Katy Perry's hometown of Santa Barbara. Amtrak runs through Santa Barbara via The Pacific Surfliner. Tell us about a memorable train trip.  In 1961 we went to California on a train.  My dad had some work to do there and my mother wouldn't fly so going by rail was what we did.  It was fun.  My mother didn't agree.3) Katy sings that her boyfriend thinks she's funny, even when she gets the punchline wrong. Do you think you're a better joke-teller or audience?  Probably teller4) Her \"teenage dream\" lover is shown working out with a heavy bag. When is the last time you visited a gym? Ha! Years and years5) Katy changes her hair a lot. She's gone from long black hair to cropped blonde hair with stops at red, green and purple. Today, are you having a good hair day?  I never have  a good hair day6) Katy thinks dimples are \"irresistible\" and can't help poking a finger when a dimpled friend smiles. Do you have dimples?  No7) Two of Katy's fragrances (Meow and Purr) are sold in cat-shaped bottles. Are you wearing a scent as you answer these questions?   I don't wear scent8)  Katy's favorite dessert is ice cream (specifically Cold Stone Creamery's Birthday Cake Remix). What's the last dessert you ate?   I broke my diet and at a biscotti last night with a cup of tea9) Random question: How often do you change your bedsheets? Once a week.  Monday is sheet day.  It always has been.  Except when I had babies in a crib -- then everyday was sheet day"},

Then, we built risers to make it multi level and this year we were planning on putting it on two folding tables but I ran across the photo above and thought that looked like a real good idea. Maybe even to be used instead of a tree. I have a lot of collectible ornaments from my kids, from places we have visited and some with just sentimental value so I don't know about not putting up a tree but how great is this ladder idea?I might be convinced to even think about Christmas this early with this idea."},

We love memes, however, and here is today's meme! Saturday 9: Gotta Travel On (1959)Unfamiliar with this week's tune? Hear it here.1) In this song, the Billy Grammer sings that \"summer's almost gone, winter's coming on.\" When you look out your window, do you see any evidence that the seasons are changing?Not really except that hurricane season is in full bloom and we are getting a lot of rain. 2) He admits he has laid around and played around for too long. Do you consider lazy days to be wasted days?Sort of.  My husband is retired and our days have sort of morphed into a no-routine hot mess.  I like routine. 3) Billy relaxed by fishing. Tell us about a visit you made to a pier, or a ride you took on a boat, this past year. (Bonus points if you went fishing!)Zero, zip, nada 4) Born in 1925, Mr. Grammer was the eldest of 13 children. He and his wife Ruth were childless. What do you think is the ideal size for a family? Depends on the family.  I am thinking that fielding a team might not be good but since that wasn't my goal, I really can't speak for others. 5) This song was very popular on juke boxes back in 1959. When were you last in a bar or restaurant that had a juke box? Did you play it?no clue so no I didn't 6) In 1959, movie tickets zoomed up in price to $1.00 and Ben Hur was the big blockbuster. What's the last movie you saw in a theater? Do you remember how much the ticket cost? We really don't go to movie theaters much and I can't tell you the last time -- maybe to see The Secret Life of Pets.   I did see Ben Hur in the theater in 1959 though -- I remember it well.  That chariot race was grueling.7) Huckleberry Hound was a hit with the younger audience in 1959. What cartoon did you enjoy as a kid? I wasn't a big cartoon fan but I did like comic books 8) In 1959, continuing dramas (soap operas) were still broadcast each day on the radio. When you turn on the radio, do you listen for talk, news, or music?   I don't listen to the radio much -- my bad -- but I do have an internet radio that I like to listen to BBC4 -- The Archers.  When I was still at home my mother and I would listen to Mystery Theater at night before bed -- I always fell asleep before it was over and never heard the end of one of those programs.  That was in 1972. 9) Random question -- Which competition would you rather judge: The Pillsbury Bake Off, The Miss America Pageant, or Dancing with the Stars? Pillsbury Bake Off I am not a fashionista.  I don't pretend to be. When I was in elementary school I wore lots of tie back dresses in plaids and medallion prints along with cardigan sweaters and penny loafers or saddle oxfords.In junior high school and high school I wore lots of skirts and sweaters -- Bobbie Brooks -- and lots of a-line dresses -- thank you Lilly Pulitzer.I grew up and went to work and it all went to hell in a hand basket.  I got married, I gained weight, the styles had changed -- my go-to formula was gone.I got pregnant -- that was another whole adventure for this non-fashionista.And here I am.  I am an aging child of the 60's with no idea what she is SUPPOSED to wear but I know what I usually wind up wearing.I wear jeans a lot -- pull on, elastic waist, fashion no-no jeans.  I wear button down shirts.  I like 'em loose and long.  Most times I am barefoot but I prefer flats -- ballet flats -- Tieks -- even though my feet don't like them.So, I was roaming around the 'net last night checking to see if Normcore was still a thing and apparently it has morphed into Menocore.MENOCOREYes, it is what it sounds like.  It is a look to help along a group of women who are generally overlooked by fashion.  The middle aged group.  It is a fashion trend to celebrate the \"age\" and help women find themselves if they are a little lost.  It consists of loose, likely linen clothing, bobbed white hair, thinness (Opps, can't identify!) and apparently wealth.Check it out on Pinterest.  Or the 'net.  Or in Vogue or Bazaar.Apparently the younger generation isn't waiting to get to be middle aged or beyond to enjoy this new trend, they are doing it now -- dressing like middle aged women.As a society we are really interesting creatures. Menocore -- who knew?"},
{"title": "MooGoo Revoo-- again", "date": "Friday, September 07, 2018", "text": "A little while back I did a review on a product called MooGoo Skin Milk Udder Cream.  I didn't give it a very good review and I am here today to fix that.At the time of the first review, I had exfoliated my face with a microfiber cloth and then applied this.  I think I was a little aggressive with the cloth and perhaps irritated my skin a bit so when I put this on it started itching after a while. So, I put it on my list of \"itchy\" things, stated that in the review, and put it away.  After a few days I decided to try it again.I absolutely love it.  No itching, no greasiness that takes forever to soak in and it makes a wonderful makeup primer.  The only thing is that the fragrance is, well, not great but it goes away quickly and the after effects are worth it.I really do love all the First Aid Beauty products I have been using for quite some time now.  They feel posh, they feel comforting, they come in really cute packaging and they cost a bundle. I had worked up to using at least six products twice a day with a couple of others for special occasion thrown in.  When you buy it all at the same time, it makes sense that you run out at approximately the same time which means a hefty purchase when you need to replenish. So......I have been looking at what I did before FAB came into my life.I used Dr. Bronner's bar soap on my face -- it is non-drying and it is full of good oils and I never had a problem with it.  I bought a bar of the baby soap at Sprouts yesterday and started using it last night.  It felt fine.Then, for a toner I used to use rosewater.  So, I picked up a bottle of Heritage Rosewater at Sprouts.  I used it last night and it felt really soothing.Then, the MooGoo.Nothing is going to get rid of the little wrinkles and things that I am, now, very aware of.  But, I need products that make my skin comfortable, don't break the bank, and are readily available. Have I totally abandoned FAB?  Probably not -- I really like it -- but we will see how the new routine goes.  Sometimes I think you can do too much to your skin as well. At least the MooGoo doesn't really make me itch."},
{"title": "Little Dutch Girl", "date": "Thursday, September 06, 2018", "text": "I am of British ancestry.  I was brought up by a mother that identified herself as British.  My grandfather was first generation American of Welsh/English immigrant parents.  I was told I had beautiful, English skin (whatever that is).Then why would my grandmother refer to my mother as \"my little Dutch girl\"?  Towheaded, blue eyed, fair complected little child whose hair flipped up all the way around like -- a little dutch girl of advertising fame -- is that what made her a little Dutch girl?She wasn't Dutch -- or was she?Let's go  back  about 30 years ago.  The interest in genealogy reared it's ugly head and I was bitten by the bug.  My mother wasn't a whole lot of help, to be honest, although she tried.  Her mom's family was a bit of a mystery.  Her grandfather was really not a part of her life and she only had snippets of info about him.His name was Banta.  My aunt swore he was Hispanic.  My mother decided he was Basque.  Clearly they didn't know and were playing the guessing game.  This was before I was involved with anything online so I was guessing right along with them.Grandfather Banta is the tall, slender gentleman in the back seat of this \"car\".  He doesn't look stereotypically Dutch, does he?  That is probably because he takes after his mother, the Choctaw Indian.I digress.So, moving right along to DNA testing.  I had mine done.  It was exactly what I expected and then not so much.The American Indian never showed up unless you do some really in depth searches.  I was looking for possible Jewish links -- again, not there unless you REALLY look.  So, what did it look like?Europe West46%Great Britain28%Ireland/Scotland/Wales21%Ok, yeah, I got it -- All that British connection -- no surprise there!But, I was ignoring the elephant on the page.  I had 46% Western European DNA connection.  I knew I had a great-great grandmother from Germany on my dad's side but I didn't believe that connection would account for 46% of my ancestry.So, I started exploring -- oh, it isn't just Germany -- it is, in large part, the Netherlands.  Hmmm......The Banta's are from the Netherlands.  How could I possess so much DNA from somebody I only knew of but had no connection to? That is a tad creepy to me.So, I have been doing some reading on The Netherlands.  While I still think of myself as primarily British ancestry, I am totally engrossed in learning about the lifestyle of my Dutch family, my roots.Is this why my favorite flower is the tulip?  Is this why my hair flips out in that very annoying way -- like my mother's did?Is this why my grandmother called my mother \"her little Dutch girl\"?  While my grandmother never knew her father, she must have known his heritage and she must have seen the genes in her daughter.Oh, yeah, the DNA test also said I have Viking blood.  Could that explain my temper?  Probably.So, I am going to continue learning about all things Dutch and figure out how much I identify with it.  I doubt I will ever lose the totally ingrained feeling of being British but how much fun are tulips and wooden shoes -- we are from Friesland.  Need to read up on Friesland.And maybe I shouldn't mind the flippy hair so much.  It has meaning."},

What's the hardest job you've ever had? The hardest job I have ever had is being a mother and a wife -- and I am still doing it.  As far as a job that I worked at outside of my home and earned money, I was a secretary to one of the assistant superintendents of a school district in my hometown.2) The lyrics tell us she has worked at this job for 28 years. What's the longest you stayed with one employer?  I was at the school job for 3 years during which time I got married, got promoted twice, got pregnant and quit for the job I am still doing.3) Donna Summer was inspired to write this song during an awards show. She ducked into the bathroom and met the elderly ladies' room attendant, whose job it was to make sure the room the spotless, the complimentary hairspray and moisturizer was abundant, and there was a hot towel for every celebrity who used the facilities. \"Wow,\" Donna thought, \"she works hard for those tips.\" Who is the last person you tipped?  It would have to be the waiter at a restaurant since I haven't had my hair professionally cut in about a year -- I know, I know,4) Early in her career, Donna was in the touring company of the musical Hair. It played in Munich for so long that she became fluent in German. What's the longest you have ever lived away from home?  I have never lived away from home.  I lived in my childhood home until I married and then I lived in our home.  I lived in my hometown until the work transfer and then I moved to my current location and my family, including parents and aunt, moved with me.  I have never lived outside my home state. I am very dull and boring.5) Sam's dad is naturally outgoing and enjoys striking up conversations with waitresses, librarians, the checker at the supermarket, etc. Sam is always polite but more private. Are you more like father or daughter? I am more like Sam's father -- I never met a stranger I wouldn't talk to -- well, within reason.  I had a lovely conversation with a lady at Half Price Books the other day who sold five boxes of books for $59.  That was pretty good.  Once I sold 117 paperbacks and only got $17.  Rip off.6) A little more than 10% of the American workforce is self-employed. Have you ever been your own boss?   I am a wife and mother -- I am truly the boss of everybody.  However, JLSHall is the family matriarch and oddly, I listen to her.  7) Labor Day weekend may offer a goldenopportunity for napping and sleeping in. Do you snore? Sometimes -- mostly during allergy season. 8) Will you be attending a Labor Day picnicor barbecue?  No, I will be cleaning out my other house to put it on the market 9) Labor Day traditionally marks thebeginning of the fall. Will you be adding any new fall clothes to your wardrobe? Probably but I tend to buy season neutral clothing anyway so I wear the same thing all the time.  Looking to pick up a couple of cardigans though.  I wish I looked cute in them, like my daughter, but I really just look like an old lady in a sweater but I do find them to be comfortable."},

Our promise to you is that we will work hard to find the most interesting and intelligent questions.  (Past hosts include: Our first - Judd Corizan, Mr. L, Kwizgiver and Bud)  Cheers to all of us thieves!Stolen from Phoenix, the Blogging Mama, which is now a private blog, unfortunately1. How has your life most benefited from the Internet? Whether it’s meeting people, cutting business overhead, finding rare collectibles, or simply sharing funny cat pictures, share how the web has made life easier. I am able to keep up with family better and I have reconnected with people I lost touch with years ago.  It also comes in handy when doing genealogy. 2. The getaway car is waiting outside – where is it taking you?Savannah, Georgia3. Do you reply to comments on your blog? All of them? Or just the really interesting ones?  Do you go back to check if the authors or the blogs you comment on reply to your comments? Yes, I replay and yes, I go back to look for comments.4. On average, how long does it take you to make an important decision? Depends on the decision -- if it is an emergency I make a decision pretty quickly -- if I am trying to buy a new sofa -- well, that can take a long time -- long enough for me to lose interest in it.5. Do you gather a lot of information prior to making the decision, or do you go with your gut in the heat of the moment? Again, depends on the decision6. What’s the most important thing you’ve learned recently? To take one day at a time and to enjoy that day and not wish your life away7. What’s your hidden talent? Are you double-jointed? Can you sneeze the alphabet? Share your unique skill.  I have no hidden talent.  Just a girl trying to get by.8. Rate the level of intensity you have about wanting to know God – no desire, low priority, curious, great desire, high priority, desperate to learn more. Explain your answer. I know God.  He is with me every minute of every day.  I talk to him everyday and he hears me.  He takes care of me because I am his child.9. What’s one of your nicknames?  How did you get that nickname? Liss.  My dad called me Liss.10. What do you have to have with you when you travel? Why? my meds because well, I need them.  Something to read.  Phone Charger.  A few clothes.11. What do you think about reading books on an electronic reading device? Do you have an electronic reading device? Do you love it? Why? If you don’t love it, why not?  I read a lot and I love books but I have been reading on a device and I love it, too.12. Do you prefer writing on paper or a keyboard? Why?Paper13. If the shoes make the man (or woman), what do your shoes say about you right now? (Assuming you’re wearing shoes. Although if you’re not, that certainly says something, too.)I am not wearing shoes.  I have a love/hate relationship with shoes.  I have problem feet.14. Describe your favorite pair of shoes. Ballet flats15. If you could wake up tomorrow having gained one ability or quality, what would it be? To get my house cleaned up in a day lie I used to be able to.BONUS:  When they \"cool sculpt\" your body, where does the fat go? I have no idea.Think (1968)Unfamiliar withthis week's song. Hear it here.In fond remembrance of The Queen of Soul (1942-2018). 1) As befits one of America's premiere artists, Aretha Franklin sang at three Presidential inaugurations. The first was Jimmy Carter's in 1977, when she sang \"God Bless America.\" What's your favorite patriotic song? America the Beautiful2) The daughter of a Baptist minister, Aretha grew up with church music. She told Rolling Stone one of her favorite songs was the hymn, \"Victory Is Mine.\" What's your favorite religious song? I have many favorites -- I love church music -- but in our church hymnal the hymns aren't named so for this I will say \"Jesus, Name Above All Names\"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBVFvtM9SzM3) She welled up a bit when President George H. W. Bush presented her with the nation's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005. When is the last time you shed a tear? Oh, I don't know.  Probably a bit weepy yesterday4) In 1980, the Queen of Soul sang for the Queen of England in a Command Performance at The Royal Albert Hall. Have you ever been to London?  Yes I have and I would like to go back5) Since Aretha had many honorary degrees, it would have been appropriate to refer to her as Dr. Franklin. Who is the last person you referred to by his or her title (Officer, Father, Sgt., Dr., etc.)? Probably my priest, Fr. Klein6)  In this week's song, Aretha tells her lover that it doesn't take a high IQ to understand what's going on in their relationship. Do you know your IQ? No7) A sculpture of Aretha is on display at Madame Tussaud's in New York. Do you think wax museums are cool, or creepy? I have never been to one and never had any desire to go to one so I guess I would have to say creepy because if I thought they were cool I would probably go.8) Aretha and Motown legend Smokey Robinson were literally lifelong friends, since they were playground buddies in Detroit. Smokey is one of the only people who can claim to have seen The Queen of Soul with a bucket in a sandbox. If we went to the playground today, would you head for the swings, the slide or the jungle gym? Or, like Aretha, would you play in the sand? I don't care for sand and I don't like climbing so I would have to say the swings or maybe the slide if it wasn't too hot.9) Random question: Do you like pumpkin seeds?  yes"},

{"title": "Girl Scout Situpon Buckets or How to Transform a Paint Bucket Into Something Stupidly Expensive", "date": "Saturday, August 25, 2018", "text": "Good morning!  I hope it is for you.  I am a little tired today and just a little grumpy.  Yesterday was a very active and busy day and I am paying for it today. Last night was our second Brownie meeting of the year.  We are joining our troop with another troop whose leaders decided they didn't want to lead anymore.  We have a group of 16 girls now as opposed to 5 and it is a lively group.  It is mixed -- we have four Daisies and the rest are Brownies.  They are working well together and I think after the next meeting we will no longer be two troops combining but actually one big troop and it will be good.Our goal last night was to have the Brownies teach the Daisies about Girl Scouts.  Several of the \"old\" girls prepared information to share with the littles.  After that, worked ensued on making a 5 gallon paint bucket into a little stool for them to sit on with room to carry all their necessary items.  We hope they will be useful during cookie booths even though they aren't supposed to sit down.  We will see.So, I made a prototype and then cut out all the necessary parts ahead of time so they would only have to assemble it.  It was chaotic enough with all that pre-made -- I can't imagine what it would have been like if we had been trying to do all the cutting during the meeting. I didn't take any photos of the event last night -- I need to do that in the future -- but I did take photos of me making mine.  So, for your viewing pleasure  --circle the size of the bucket lid cut out of cardboard -- we used moving boxes because we had them and they were free -- Girl Scouts are always frugal and resourcefulFour layers of extra loft batting to fit the cardboard circleThe lid before I attached the velcro -- low profile, industrial strength velcro cut into four pieces and spaced equally (12, 3, 6, and 9 like a clock).  I had put the loop and the fastener pieces together as a unit so when I stuck the bottom piece down I only had to remove the tape off the top one and place the covered \"cushion\" on the top and stuck to the velcroThe cardboard circle with the batting was covered in the fabric of their choice.  It was stretched around to the back and secured with duct tape.  It was easy to work with it to get a really smooth and nice looking cushion so when it was attached to the velcro, this is what it looked likeDecoration was their choice and the only requirement was that their name and troop number be visible.  So, here is my name and troop number.And a little bit more ribbony goodness.  I have since added a sticker and a cross hanging from the handle.  I don't have a photo of that though.So, yes, that has been what I have been doing the last couple of days.  It was really interesting to see the girls work on these last night.  There was all manner of fabric, embellishments, bling, hang-y things.  Their personalities really came out and they had a wonderful time. Now, I just have to clean up the mess I made."},
{"title": "A Scientist I Am Not", "date": "Wednesday, August 22, 2018", "text": "Back in my school days my strengths were English and History.  I had no use for math -- odd I would enjoy quilting with all the geometry involved -- and science -----well, I learned I was allergic to formaldehyde in high school biology so there you go.  It makes sense, then, that I would marry a microbiologist who never met a math problem he didn't like, right?Anyway.I have several hobbies, not the least of which is researching my family tree.  It doesn't take but two generations of searching to get me across the great pond and that makes the searching a bit dicier.  Enter Ancestry DNA testing.Yes, I did.  I took the test.  I wasn't surprised at the results they showed, I was surprised at what they didn't show but that is another conversation.  Then I downloaded my results to Gedmatch.com and found another whole slew of \"matches\" -- some I recognized, some not so much.Facebook groups on family history have begun to immerge and I joined one dealing with Wales and Welsh DNA.  People are putting their kit numbers up there for comparison.  I have done the same and never come up with any matches which is disturbing considering my great-grandparentage.So, yesterday I was contacted by a person who showed how we were a match and how if you use a certain search criteria you might find more matches.  I tried and I did, only to be told that I might come up with some false positives.  Sounds like medical testing.I spent last evening putting in kit numbers and doing comparisons and have come up with three people that I truly think might be related.  I don't know how or where -- well, somewhere in Wales I would suspect.I can honestly say this is the most confusing thing I have ever seen.  I know nothing about DNA and at this point I am pretty sure I am incapable of learning.  I guess I will just have to rely on the knowledge and wisdom of others. So confused."},
{"title": "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil", "date": "Tuesday, August 21, 2018", "text": "This spring when we were visiting Savannah, Georgia I decided to make sure my souvenirs were meaningful.  It is so easy to just get lost in souvenir shops because that is what we do when we travel, isn't it?  Food and souvenirs.So, I decided that on this trip I would only buy two sorts of things -- books on the area and Christmas ornaments.  I have found that these sorts of things are easy to transport home, unlike a large model of Westminster Abbey.  That is another post, however.One of the books I decided to purchase was \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\" by John Berendt.  We all know that I am a sucker for good covers and I love the cover of this book.  I love the \"bird girl\" statute and the general spookiness of it. I couldn't wait to delve into the book.But, since it was a souvenir I decided to borrow it on my kindle through overdrive so I could keep my copy pristine.  I started reading the library copy but didn't finish so I rechecked it.  Still didn't finish so I moved on to my copy.  The reading got slower and slower and I am not one to move on until I am done with something, especially as close to the end as I was.  But.....I had reached a draggy point and it was like trying to plod through quicksand.  Do they have quicksand in Georgia? I will have to Google that.Finally the other day I picked the book up -- which is no longer pristine I might add after having carried it in my purse and dog-earring a few pages -- and decided to finish it. And I have.So, what did I think?  I have enjoyed it but it does have draggy spots.  I guess I got bogged down in the Williams trial (just read it) but the book does share the flavor of Savannah with all it's quirkiness.I will say that before I started the book I watched the movie with Kevin Spacey in the lead and I really enjoyed it -- mostly because I got to see Savannah again and I loved it.  I don't always enjoy the movie versions of books but this I did.Would I recommend?  Yes, I would.  I would also recommend the movie.  I would also recommend a visit to Savannah in person.  Wear comfortable shoes and a crossbody bag.  And prepare yourself for lots of souvenir shops.I still wish I had tried to bring home a bird girl statue."},
{"title": "It's a Jungle Out There", "date": "Saturday, August 18, 2018", "text": "Thursday, August 16, 2018It's a Jungle Out ThereWelcome to Saturday 9. What we've committed to our readers is that we will post 9 questions every Saturday. Sometimes the post will have a theme, and at other times the questions will be totally unrelated. Those weeks we do \"random questions,\" so-to-speak. We encourage you to visit other participants posts and leave a comment. Because we don't have any rules, it is your choice. We hate rules. We love memes, however, and here is today's meme! Saturday 9: It's a Jungle Out There (Theme from Monk) (2003)Unfamiliar with this week's tune? Hear it here.1) This week's song is the theme from the detective show that ran from 2002-2009. Were you a fan? Never watched it.2) The song warns us about the air we breathe and the water we drink. Does your home have an air or water filter?  I have a filter on the water dispenser in the fridge.3) The lyrics say, \"People say I'm crazy to worry all the time.\" Are you a worrier? Or do you just take things as they come?  Worrier.  I come from a long line.4) TV's Adrian Monk is known for his outstanding deductive powers, an homage to Sherlock Holmes. Have you read any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books featuring Sherlock Holmes?  No but watched it plenty on TV.5) Monk was also known for fastidiousness and precision, an homage to Hercule Poirot. Have you read any of Agatha Christie's books featuring Poirot?  No.  Again, tv.  My husband's guilty pleasure6) This song was written and performed by Grammy and Emmy winner Randy Newman. Do you have any trophies or plaques? No, I wasn't a competitor of anything.7) Before winning an Oscar in 2001, Mr. Newman had the distinction of having the most nominations (15) without a win. Do you consider yourself a graceful loser?  I don't really know -- never been tested as I was never competitive.  Oh, I did win a free soda at a restaurant in the mall where I took ballroom dance at about 13.  Does that count?8) In 2003, when this song was introduced, Lance Armstrong won his fifth Tour de France. Later, he was disgraced in a doping scandal. Can you think of a time when a hero disappointed you?  Never really had heroes.9) Random question -- We're catering lunch. Should we put you down for a burger or a taco?  Taco, please."},
{"title": "MooGoo Review", "date": "Friday, August 17, 2018", "text": "Hi, Friends!  As I mentioned earlier, I have decided to change up my skin care a bit.  I have been using First Aid Beauty and, while it is a fabulous product I have learned that some of the line has questionable ingredients in it.  I believe the basic products are good and non-toxic and I will continue to have those on hand but I thought I would branch out a bit.I was watching a documentary with Julie Walters the other day -- a railway journey across Britain -- and they visited a dairy farm.  The hostess looked considerably younger than her years and she said she used the udder cream on her face that they used on the cows at the dairy.I decided to try it so I ordered some Natural Skin Milk Udder Cream from MooGoo of Australia.  They have a place in the US so it didn't take forever to get here.It arrived yesterday.  They also included a cute little sample of their Natural Milk Wash.  I love samples.So, I immediately went in and washed my face with the face wash and applied the moisturizer and waited to itch.  Things tend to make me itch and tingle.  I thought this product was going to but it didn't really.  I think what I felt was my imagination.  I didn't get red or splotchy which is good.  Right now my skin is really dry so I decided to exfoliate with a microfiber cloth and I think I just irritated everything.  Microfiber cloths are great for removing makeup without chemicals but I think my skin has gotten a bit more uh, \"mature\" and delicate for that.  So, don't know if I will keep it up.So, this morning I decided to repeat the MooGoo plan and so far so good.It is NOT greasy.  It feels almost like putting vaseline on  your face but it soaks right in.  I am anxious to see what  it feels like to apply makeup on top of it because it isn't greasy or slippery or anything.  I am just relatively soft but I don't look like I fell into a vat of moisturizer.One of my goals in exploring new options is to reduce products.  While the safety of the product is of importance to me, so is the efficacy.  I have been using a LOT of product with the FAB line.  I absolutely love their stuff and I use the cleanser, the facial brightening pads, the serums, the eye cream, the coconut primer and some of the make up products.  My face has never looked better but.........It is a LOT of stuff to use twice a day and it isn't cheap.  It isn't hugely expensive but when you are using that many products it adds up.  I am sort of looking to pare down with both skin care and make up products.I don't really wear much makeup.  I use Mineral Fusion powder foundation, a bit of blush, either Pacifica or Bare Minerals or sometimes just my lipstick because that works as well.  I use a Revlon lipstick that rates #2 on EWG or Mineral Fusion or even some of Burt's Bees lip balms (and yes, for blush as well)  I use mascara and done.MooGoo has a line of lip balms that I might order next.  I really like lip balms and my lips are worse in the summer than in the winter if you can imagine.  MooGoo also has a line of cosmetics called Dustygirl.  It is mineral makeup and I might try their lip shine product.  I am not a big lipstick gal but if I don't put on something I feel just not finished. Ok, I am digressing.  The package came with a very nice, well done product guide.  Full color and glossy with lots of description of the products.  Their website is well done as well.Today is only the second use of the products.  I will let you know how it goes but so far so good.  Now I have to figure out why my hands are itching.  I changed dishwashing detergent to Seventh Generation and I wonder if that is the culprit.Aug 17 -- mid day --Ok, I have been trying to ignore it all day but I am afraid the new products are causing to me to react.  I have had subtle itching and stinging on my cheeks all day so I finally went in and washed it all over and used my regular FAB products-- just the face wash and the thick moisturizer.  It is beginning to feel better.  I wanted it to work, I really, really did."},
{"title": "I Used To.......", "date": "Sunday, August 12, 2018", "text": "I used to love to shop for clothes.  Eh, not so much.I used to love to shop for shoes. Pointless with wide feet.I used to love to shop for jewelry -- ok, I still shop for jewelry.I used to love to eat sweets.  Well, broke that addiction -- bummer.I used to love to buy makeup.  Well, two things happened.  I got sick and felt the need to detox my life and go a bit more natural and less chemical laden.  And...I got old and guess what, girls, what works at 20 or 40 just doesn't work at 60.  So,  I have systematically thrown out all the chemical laden makeup and explored the natural brands.  Some are good, some not so good but the general concensus is I do better without much of any of it.That sent me on a journey to find natural, non toxic skincare because we all know what is UNDER the makeup is what matters.  The natural stuff is good but it is good and pricey too.  I happened upon a brand called First Aid Beauty and it has been really good for my skin.  It is moderately priced and I have been using it for a while and have been happy.However today I was doing a bit of browsing waiting for the ice and aspirin to kick in for my painful hip joint so I decided to look at other non toxic lines.  With all the sites I saw, I never saw FAB listed so I googled toxicity and I was shocked.  It hadn't been on EWG before but it is now and I was shocked that some of the stuff I was using was in the #9 range.  Ok, so the general thought process is -- at 68 years old do I really need to worry about that?  Probably not but I do.So, I decided to explore more DIY solutions.  I found a recipe for honey facial cleanser.  It was easy.  It was honey.  You could add a little milk or cream, mix it up and wash your face.  I thought, ok, I have the ingredients so let's give it a go.  It was great.  I didn't have on any mascara so I don't know about removal of that but my face felt wonderful.I have normal skin that tends toward dry so I looked for a toner and what do you know -- I had it in my hand.  The website said \"brew a cup of green tea and use a cotton ball to apply to face\".  Well I had just had a cup of green tea and I had just enough left in the cup (it was cold by now anyway) to do this.  It was nice.Then I applied some of my MyChelle Vitamin C serum and I itched.  I didn't put on any moisturizer and just put on my makeup  which is so minimal it almost doesn't exist.   I use Mineral Fusion powder foundation, thrivecausmetics mascara and a little blush from Pacifica.  I use tinted lip balms.  See what I mean about minimal.  But, the more I put on the older I look so there you go.Yesterday after we were watching a documentary of Acorn about railway journey's through Britain with Julie Walters.  They were visiting a dairy farm in Scotland and Ms. Walters was shocked when her hostess said that she was 61 years old.  I promise you that she didn't look anywhere near 61.  She explained that the udder cream that they use on the cows works wonders on her too!So, what did I do?  I let my fingers take me straight to Amazon where I promptly ordered some MooGoo Udder Cream.It is on it's way.So, I am thinking I might try the honey/cream facial cleanser, Thayers Rose Witch Hazel for toner if I need it and this udder stuff for a moisturizer.  Maybe skipping the Vit C serum as I am still sort of stinging.  I might keep the Burt's Bees Micellar water for the mascara if the honey/cream doesn't work on that.   Right now I am doing so many things with so many products that I would like to pare it down but want to keep it natural.So, what do you think?  Washing my face with stuff from the kitchen and using cow stuff on my face?I will let you know!"},
{"title": "Weight Loss -- It Is Such a Heavy Subject", "date": "Saturday, August 11, 2018", "text": "The NannyWelcome to Saturday 9. What we've committed to our readers is that we will post 9 questions every Saturday. Sometimes the post will have a theme, and at other times the questions will be totally unrelated. Those weeks we do \"random questions,\" so-to-speak. We encourage you to visit other participants posts and leave a comment. Because we don't have any rules, it is your choice. We hate rules. We love memes, however, and here is today's meme!   Saturday 9: The Nanny (1993)Unfamiliar with this week's tune? Hear it here.1) This week's song is the theme from a sitcom that originally aired from 1993 to 1999. Were you a fan?  No.  I have watched it once in a while but would never seek it out.2) The song tells us that Fran once worked in a bridal shop. Have you ever worked in a retail setting? No, but I think it would be fun.  My mom and aunt were retail ladies and they made it sound so exciting.4) \"The Nanny\" is the colorful one, the one who wears red when everyone else wears tan. What color do you think you look best in? I look best in pale colors, pastels, and neutrals close to my face.  I don't look good in prints and I am trying to eliminate them from my wardrobe completely.  In slacks I prefer dark neutrals like navy and black.  I am not a beige, khaki or brown person.  When I was young and my hair was dark with a lot of auburn in it, brown worked but now since it is a lovely shade of mouse brown is a no-go.  5) The TV show, The Nanny, was the brainchild of actress Fran Drescher. She got the idea while visiting her an old friend in London. Her friend's pre-teen daughter enjoyed having Fran as a confidante and shopping buddy. Do you enjoy shopping as a leisure activity? Or would you prefer to just dash into a store, grab what you need, and get out and go home? Shopping is a necessary evil.  I used to love it, but  now, not so much.  I can never find what I am looking for when I go to stores so I generally shop online.  I always buy clothes online.  Recently I tried to go out and shop but it was so frustrating I swore never again.  6) The friend Fran was visiting in London was Twiggy, who was the world's most famous model in the 1960s. Name another famous model.3) The kids in the Sheffield household appreciate their nanny's \"joie de vivre,\" which is defined as \"exuberant enjoyment of life.\" Are you feeling joie de vivre this morning?  Another model?  Cindy Crawford.  Joie de Vivre?  Uh, all I am feeling this morning is numb since I have been icing my knee for two hours.  7) The Nanny: The Complete Series is available on DVD on Amazon. It consists of 19 discs and takes 55 hours to watch, start to finish. What TV show have you recently binge watched?  Ok, I will admit I have been binge watching \"Hart of Dixie\" on Netflix with Rachel Bilson and Tim Matheson.  I absolutely love it.  Four seasons with LOTS of episodes.  I am in the middle of season 2.  My husband can't wait for it to be done.8) The Nanny theme was sung by Liz Callaway. Her father, the late John Callway, was a long-time Chicago newscaster. Have you, or has a loved one, ever been on TV?  My father was a long-time anchor for the CBS affiliate in San Antonio, Texas.  He did lots of other programming for that station as well as KLRN -- the PBS channel in San Antonio.  I was never on tv but I really wanted to dance on San Antonio's equivalent of Bandstand.  It was called Swingtime.  My mother wouldn't let me..  9) Random question -- Which of these adjectives comes closest to describing you: sexy, sophisticated or down-to-earth?  Sexy was never an adjective that I would use to describe myself and I don't think anybody else would either.  I am not sophisticated at all although I would love to be.  Down to earth, however, fits me to a T.   Thanks so much for joining us again at Saturday: 9. As always, feel free to come back, see who has participated and comment on their posts. In fact sometimes, if you want to read & comment on everyone's responses, you might want to check back again tomorrow. But it is not a rule. We haven’t any rules here. Join us on next Saturday for another version of Saturday: 9, \"Just A Silly Meme on a Saturday!\" Enjoy your weekend!I have weight issues.  I suspect I am not alone.I have dietary issues.  Again, probably not alone.I have cooking issues.  Ditto.I have tried to solve the problem and on one hand, I did and on the other hand, not so much.I have carried too much weight for a LONG time.  My knees, ankles and hips are paying the price.  I decided to follow my daughter down the Keto road.  The goal to lose about 150 million pounds and to break my sugar addiction.  I have lost 7.5 lbs and keep gaining and losing the same last two over and over again.  My clothes are loser though.  I don't get it.  So, I didn't exactly lose those millions of pounds but I did successfully break the sugar addiction.  My guilty pleasure is cookies -- not cake, candy or pies -- just cookies.  I haven't had one in over a month.  I don't crave them anymore.  I think that is a success that should be rewarded -- with jewelery not cookies!I get easily confused about \"eating plans\" AKA diets.  I was raised to believe  you eat a balanced diet (no cookies aren't a food group), you eat a normal serving and you get on with life.  That is what I have always done until I wanted to lose weight a LONG time ago.  Then I went on a reduced calorie diet and I lost lots of weight but I think that deeply ingrained the \"diet\" mentality in me.  I have tried them all.  I have journaled my food, counted every grain of anything I put in my mouth and wrote it down.  When I reached 1200 calories I was done.  If that was at breakfast -- too bad so sad.  There was the grapefruit thing, the high protein-low carb thing, the egg and grapefruit thing -- there has always been a \"thing\".I was the down the rabbit hole.  I gained weight easily, had two kids, had forgotten how to eat correctly.I am trying to recover that knowledge.I don't think the Keto diet is eating correctly but after a month I did break the cookie/sugar addiction and now the only thing I am looking at is how much \"sugar\" I am eating and by sugar I mean added sugars and starch.  I am not ready to give up fruit yet.I am cognizant of portions and choosing not to eat starchy things -- green peas are safe in my presence.I am choosing to use heavy cream in my tea rather than Lactaid but I fear that I am going to have to stop that because the cream is giving my tummy fits.  And I feel I need to add more fiber to my diet. I am trying to channel my teeny tiny mother from beyond and I feel she is speaking to me.  She never ate an early breakfast -- or hardly any breakfast at all and if she ate toast with her coffee she wouldn't eat a sandwich at lunch.  Most times she didn't eat lunch which probably wasn't good -- she was a smoker and I think that controlled her appetite.  She didnt bake much and she didn't buy lots of cookies or desserts at the store.  When she did, I don't remember having an uncontrolled desire for them.  All this sweet craving came after I was an adult.  Unfortunately, we did drink soda which I gave up years ago now. When Mom cooked dinner we had a meat, starch, two veg or a veg and a salad.  I asked her why she planned meals that way -- she said she learned it in school.  We went to the same schools and had a lot of the same teachers so when I took Home Ec. in the 7th grade, I learned that method of meal planning from the ancient Home Ec. teacher who was probably ancient when my mother had her.  Actually she was only about 45 when I had her but in the 60's I believe 45 was the new \"old crone\".  Anyway, I digress.  That is still how I plan meals but I am leaning more toward a meat/salad/veg.  My husband is diabetic and he doesn't need the starch.I have also retrained myself to not eat between meals and not eat after dinner.  Growing up I never ate between meals (they didn't let us snack at school) and after dinner my mom cleaned up the kitchen and there weren't going to be any dirty dishes.  Period. So, now that I have been on Keto for a month or so, I have completely wrecked my digestive tract although I have felt, generally, much better.  I have kicked the cookies to the curb, I have learned the joy of cream.  I have learned that I miss my morning cereal but am adding some plain oatmeal back in.  I know that my body isn't working as well without my dried fruit and pecans as a snack but I have given up snacks so those items will probably have to be part of a meal.I am eating no more than 1200 calories a day and I feel that I am eating better quality food (cookies aren't good quality).  I feel better.  I look better and my neck looks thinner -- that is a big deal for me.  I feel like I am doing the right thing for myself. I feel that calorie control is a better option for me because I can generally eat any variety of food I want.  I think that, if given the freedom to do so, my calorie controlled diet will actually be more Keto anyway if I am choosing to spend my calories on less processed foods. I guess basically it just comes down to choice and I am trying to make better choices, more nutritionally intelligent choices.  I am journaling my food just to see the choices I am making.  I am paying attention to portions.  I am trying to be smart.I guess if I just keep gaining/losing the same two pounds that is just natures way of telling me that life is funny and my body is a joke! But at least I don't want cookies anymore and that, folks, is what I did this summer."},

{"title": "June? Already?", "date": "Saturday, June 02, 2018", "text": "I can't believe it is already June! What happened to May?  I guess I blinked.We have had some really early really warm days here in Texas.  We don't usually have 100+ days in early June but yet, here we are.  A lot of people complain about the heat -- the same ones that complain about the cold -- but I am not one of them.  I don't do well in extreme heat because of medications that I take that make it worse but I am blessed that I have air conditioning and I have the freedom to stay indoors and enjoy it. How do I enjoy it, you might ask?  Well, I have several hobbies that I enjoy -- reading, needlework and drawing -- the drawing is new.  I also do my exercise indoors. And there is the ever-present housework to keep me busy.The other thing that I really enjoy is watching the birds.  We have positioned the bird feeders close to the breakfast area windows and we are always entertained by them.  We have a large dove that likes to sit on the top of the hook from which the feeder hangs and when he takes off in flight the whole thing springs back and forth!  Lots of activity out there right now.We have a cardinal family that has been around here since we moved in and they are so lovely.  A brown thrasher family has joined in the neighborhood and they must have babies because the male just paces the yard catching bugs for their meals.  He looks rather frantic as he paces -- maybe we have more birds than bugs?  It is a very active yard and so much fun to sit with a cuppa and just watch. While it is hot outside we have had a great time planting our little fairy gardens.  I am not sure if the fairies like them but we did our best.  I am planning out the next one that is going to be a beach scene in a galvanized bucket.  My husband thinks I am a little crazy but I think I am creative! And nothing like keeping Hobby Lobby in business!So, we are expecting a cold front (haha!yes, the term the weather wizards used) later today but for now we are experiencing the hottest day of the year so far so I am watching PBS -- a lovely documentary on Italy -- looks lovely!"},
{"title": "Summer -- the Beginning", "date": "Tuesday, May 29, 2018", "text": "Summer began for us, as a family, early this year and both my daughter and her daughter were out of school last Friday. This is the first time my daughter has been done with school before June. In addition to school being out, things at church have wound down as well.  The choir is on summer hiatus and Sunday School is done for the summer.  Our Sunday School program for the littles is The Catechesis of the Good Shepherd begun by Maria Montessori.  It is a wonderful program and the children just love it.I am continuing to read toward my Goodreads goal.  Right now I am reading \"Midnight In the Garden of Good and Evil\".  I bought a copy while I was in Savannah but I am reading it on my Kindle after checking it out on Overdrive from my public library.  I am nearly done and will review.The Hubs has had a couple of projects to deal with.  One involves shimming up my bookcase in the bedroom.  It is a large bookcase and I never had a problem with it leaning before but the carpet in my new bedroom is very thick and the bookcase just leans and honestly, it pretty much scares me to death because it is tall and heavy and the thought of it falling isn't pretty.And, I had an idea for a knock-down play house for Hubs to build out of PVC pipe and cover with sheets.  This is it.I found the plans on the internet and it works well.  It is rather huge though.And then, the Fairy Gardens have been planted and here they are -- ta da!this one isn't quite finishedthis is the main oneWe did this quite early this morning as it is really hot right now in North Texas.  The mosquitoes almost carried us off and the heat got us really quickly.  So, by 10 a.m. the gardens were planted and dressed, we were showered and ready for a quiet day indoors!Tonight -- we will work on a puzzle! We haven't done that in a while and it seems like a nice thing to do after dinner!Summer is getting off to a nice start."},
{"title": "New Old School -- AKA Old Dog Learning New Tricks -- for me anyway", "date": "Friday, May 25, 2018", "text": "I have a love/hate relationship with my crock pot.  It is a good crock pot.  I can brown meat in it on the stove.  It cooks a mean pot of beans.  The crock is removable so cleaning is relatively easy.  So what is my problem?Everything coming out of it tastes the same.  I recently made a recipe of orange chicken.  It was dreadful -- and I couldn't tell the chicken from the roast I cooked last. I prefer the oven but......what if I leave the house.My mother would have never left the oven on and left the house so, as a result, it never occurred to me.  I do remember one time that I programmed the oven to come on and heat a lasagne while I was at church but that was walking on the wild side for me.So, I want to cook a roast.  I don't want to put it in the crock pot.  I want to slow cook it in the oven.  I am going to be brave and put in on low (300) and then go get the g-daughter from school.  I am going to leave the oven on. This is ridiculous -- I am sure it will be fine. I think I am too old a dog to learn new tricks!"},
{"title": "Little Women", "date": "Monday, May 14, 2018", "text": "Did anybody watch the Masterpiece Theater (PBS) adaptation of \"Little Women\" last night?  I waited for weeks for it, I was so excited!  Seems my neighbor decided to talk on his ham radio last night which caused a good deal of interference with my antenna so it was a dicey viewing.  I was upset.Aside from that, however, it was very enjoyable.  It was much different than either of the movie versions I have seen multiple times in my life.  The casting was was well done.  None of these girls looked like glamour queens (i.e. Elizabeth Taylor) -- they all looked quite representative of young women the ages they were playing.I am always interested in settings when I watch anything.  I like to look at the backgrounds of photos as well.  It was filmed in Wicklow, Ireland which I find to be a bit strange.  To be such an \"American\" story, I would have thought it would have been filmed in Massachusetts where the book was set.  The setting is gorgeous, as you would expect, but the viewer (if watching such things) gets the feeling that the setting isn't quite right.  It is beautiful however, so no points lost there.Angela Lansbury does a bang up job as Aunt March.  She defies her age.  It was a treat watching her in this role.  I still watch re-runs of \"Murder She Wrote\" so I am a big Lansbury fan.I completely enjoyed this show -- despite the interference from the annoying neighbor --and am looking forward to the second part next week.  All of this and the Royal Wedding as well!  It will be a good weekend."},
{"title": "Homebody or Recluse?", "date": "Friday, May 11, 2018", "text": "I am noticing that, as I am aging, I am changing in ways I never imagined.  Oh yes, the obvious things like the hair, the waistline (or lack of ),  the newly acquired purple Hurrycane....\"These aren't the things I am talking about.  I am talking about my change in interests and habits and such.When I was young and when my children were young, I enjoyed all the things younger people enjoy.  I liked going shopping and chatting with the neighbors (sort of, I am an introvert after all) and I absolutely loved going to bookstores.Well, now the kids are grown, I don't care for shopping anymore, don't really know my neighbors yet (that might be ok!) and the bookstores are all gone.Online shopping has squelched any desire I had to shop -- I mean, why bother when you can just click a button and it arrives at your door.  Maybe.  Or is dropped by a drone.  Speaking of drones -- we saw one in the neighborhood across the street spying on the traffic at the intersection.  It was scary -- on the same level as those big white wind turbines. I digress.So, have I become a homebody or a recluse?  Seems I don't really want to be anywhere but home.  I like my house to be clean, quiet and sort of dark and cool.  It isn't always that way because of the g-kids who come around but for the most part, I really like it to be serene. In our old house we had plantation shutters on the windows.  In this house we have venetian blinds that need to be replaced.  Hubs wants more shutters.  I like the blinds.  They let in more light and they remind me of my youth.  My mother was an ace at making our house seem peaceful and serene and a lot of it had to do with thoseblinds.  I am afraid a lot of my reading about minimalism has stuck with me.  I like these minimalist blinds. But, I want new ones, I want my OWN blinds.I have a routine these days.  It is rather slow and deliberate.  It is almost imperative because of my gimpy knees but it makes me feel like I am in control.  Not much gets set around on the tables and such.  I don't buy magazines anymore so I have eliminated the clutter of that.  The bookstores are all gone, for the most part, so I buy books or check them from the library on my Kindle.  I absolutely love that.It just seems like I have settled into this odd existence.  So different that it used to be.  But, I like it.  I like the quiet.  I like the world being \"out there\" with the dreadful traffic and the horrible problems we see everyday in the news and on social media.  I like me being \"in here\" to keep things simple and serene. I wonder what is wrong with me."},
{"title": "Made In Savannah -- Cozy Series by Hope Callaghan", "date": "Thursday, May 03, 2018", "text": "I have just finished the last available book in the cozy mystery series \"Made In Savannah\" by Hope Callaghan.  There were 9 books in the series with a 10th due out soon.  I am looking forward to it.This series was delightful to read and held my interest, clearly.  The books are clean yet not squeaky --they do involve the Mafia, after all! They are not long books and are really quick reads. The characters are not as fleshed out and complex as they could be but it is very easy to identify with Carlita's plight trying to keep her children on the up and up -- pretty difficult for a Mafia wife! And Elvira -- what a character -- the kind of you love to hate but end up really liking -- just because.  The character of Mercedes could have been developed more but I suspect that is going to come in the next book. If you have any knowledge of Savannah, Georgia, you will be able to identify places with changed names, events and activities that are associated with the city, and the architectural descriptions.  However, I think the settings could have been expanded upon.  If you don't have a good working knowledge of Savannah, it would be hard to develop a mental picture of the area.The plots are good but could have a few more twists and turns.  They are safe and straightforward but would be more engaging with more intrigue and complication.With all this said, however, I do recommend these books.  If they hadn't been good I would never have stayed through the entire series.  I am looking forward to book 10 and hope it is out soon!"},

{"title": "Food Journal Re-deaux", "date": "Sunday, April 22, 2018", "text": "I have had a \"weight problem\" (real or imagined) all my life.  I had a \"weight problem\" when I weighed 114 lbs and was pregnant with my first child.  Why did I have this problem?  Two reasons -- an overweight father whose weight was my mother's main focus in life and a mother who was incredibly tiny, could wear anything she wanted and never had a tummy pooch in her life.I know, I know, don't put the blame on the parents so I won't put all the blame on them -- I was also a teenager in the 60's when the gold standard for girls were people like Jean Shrimpton and Twiggy.So, I am a grown up now and should have moved on past that, right?  Well, except that I have gone the way of most women my age and the weight has come on, seemingly overnight, and it just won't go away.  Factor in meds that make weight loss difficult and arthritis that makes exercise hard and what do you have -- I know there is a name for it.For years I kept track of my calories and amount of food I ate.  I can't do that anymore -- just can't do it.  So, I have been practicing a method of eating called moderation -- you eat only when you are hungry, you stop when you are satisfied and you eat what you want.  I have gone a step farther and tried to not eat between meals or after dinner.  In theory this works great -- in reality though, it is easy to lose focus and forget your self imposed rules.So, I am going to try to keep a food journal.  Not to weigh and measure all I eat and list it on a piece of paper.  More to just keep track of what I am eating and when and how I am feeling when I eat as a tool to keep me on the moderation plan.I know how to eat healthy.  I know to stop eating when I am feeling satisfied (note: not full like OMgosh I ate the whole turkey).  I know how to make good choices over bad but when I lose focus I fall into the obvious trap of \"eat whatever you want until you are satified\".  That sounds great until you start talking about chocolate chip cookies.The thing is, when I was growing up my pediatrician told my mother that all foods should be introduced and, if well tolerated, should be offered on a regular basis.  Nothing was off limits.  Not even desserts but people, use some sense, if the kid won't eat the squash, don't try to fill her up with ice cream!  Fortunately my mother employed the pedi's method and I have always eaten a wide variety of food and yes, I love ice cream!So, the reason I want to start the food journal is to make sure I am making good choices and staying balanced.  It will also help to pull out the journal when the doctor's say \"you need to try to lose some weight\".  I can show them what I eat and they can figure out if maybe it is something out of my control -- like their meds!  Plus, my memory isn't so good anymore and I will be able to get a good picture of how I am taking care of myself for my own information. And it gives me a reason to peruse pinterest for some cute journal ideas.Do you food journal?  Does it work for you?  Is it useful or just another aggravating thing to add to the day? On this day, in 1970, the first Earth Day was celebrated.I do my best to reduce my carbon footprint and be ecologically aware.  However, as I am getting older, I am finding it harder to do a lot of the stuff I used to do.  It would be easier if my knees would cooperate but, so far, they aren't. So, Happy Earth Day -- be sure to recycle and be aware of how your habits affect the earth, the people on it and, no small thing, your pocketbook.  Have a wonderful day -- go plant a tree or a geranium!  Personally I am really digging all the bright red geraniums I am seeing around town.On the reading front I am reading the series \"Made in Savannah\" by Hope Callaghan.  I am on book 8 of 9.  This cozy mystery series has sucked me in since my visit to Savannah and, because it is easy read, I have just flown through the books.  These books aren't complicated or sophisticated but they are fun to read.After visiting the area and reading about the history and some of the curiosities of the city, I have enjoyed reading these books because, even though the names of places and events have been changed, it is very transparent and I know what they are talking about.  By reading these books it has sort of extended my visit.I have been researching more books set in Savannah that AREN'T a series and I have a list that I am going to read when I am done with this.  The first one is obviously \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\".  I watched the movie but I understand the book is so much better.  There are a couple by Mary Kay Andrews as well that are set in Savannah.  I love lowcountry settings as I have never lived near a beach and I really enjoy the reading atmosphere.So, today is our congregational picnic at church.  It is always a lively affair with all the kids running all over the playground and good food.  I am not there, however, as my knee has me sidelined.  My husband, daughter and granddaughter are there though and I hope they are having a wonderful time!The rest of the day is going to find me trying to do some laundry and picking up and just putting things to right for the upcoming week.  I am hobbling pretty well though so not sure how much I will get done but we will see.  I see a crock pot dinner in my future!Have a wonderful Sunday! Hopefully all that advil I am taking will help the knee soon!"},
{"title": "April 19,2018", "date": "Thursday, April 19, 2018", "text": "On this date, in 1775, the American Revolution began.I hope nothing so monumental happens today.Actually, today I am sitting her thinking about the blogs I read and how much information I derive from them.I love blog reading and have made some good friends from reading those blogs.  As well, they are chock full of useful information, funny stories, sad times illustrating the human condition and lots of ideas for our own lives. .One blog I read is about fashion -- it is titled susanafter60.com.  It is written by Susan who decided her life needed a change and she set about reinventing herself.  Her original blog was called fiftynotfrumpy and has now evolved into the current incarnation.  I am not a fashionista although I used to be much more interested in clothes than I am now.  Now my focus in on shoes that don't make my feet hurt but that is another whole post.  While the things that Susan wears would not suit my body type her approach to clothes buying and fashion is very helpful and I have taken her points to heart.  It makes sense to me.  As she is aging (aren't we all?) she is discussing ways to embrace that age and continue forward in a way to feel good about yourself.  One of her key words is \"soft\".  I am learning a lot from Susan and I would suggest that anybody visit her blog at least once.Another blog that I read is g.donna.com.  For some reason it won't let me link but you should seek it out anyway.  It is written by Donna who, along with her husband, has created an experience of living in different time periods by adjusting her home and activities to reflect a certain decade.  Right now they are living in the mid-1940's.  They research the time period they are interested in and outfit their home to give them an idea of what it is to live in that period and they stay there for a year.  I believe that the year they are in now, 1944, is where they would like to stay permanently.  Now, her way of life is a bit too labor intensive for me -- I would probably be healthier if I could live like that but I don't think this old girl has it in her.  Plus, 1944 was before my time so many of the things I hear her talk about is reminiscent of things my parents spoke of.  However, her home is delightful, her gardens heavenly, and reading her blog does take me back to a simpler time and it is like a great big \"sigh\" to just look at her photos.On a daily basis I read \"Frugally Challenged\" and \"Trundling Through Life\" written by my penpal, Mary.  I just delight in her posts -- we are approximately the same age which means we have memories of the same time periods and it is so interesting to see her talk about her life in the UK and I can compare my life in the US.  She has guest posts -- most notably from her caretaker Jack.  Jack is a character of the highest order and I have developed a great liking of Jack and his posts -- such fun! So sorry about your knees Jack but glad you are on the mend. Tracing Rainbows is another along with Jenny of Elefantz.  I love the needlework ideas, the gardens, the cooking -- it is just like I have good neighbors who like to get together for a chat over a cuppa.Joysweb and A Little Reading are also regular reading for me.  Of course, Joy is my cousin so Joysweb keeps me up on what she is doing.  A Little Reading, also by Joy, is a good source for reading material as she is an avid reader/reviewer.  We all know, however, that I do judge my books by their covers!I read many others as well, equally as charming and informative (they are all listed on my blog sidebar) and I look forward to seeing what is going on with my bloggy friends.  It has become a highlight of my day to check in on these folks and see what is going on in their worlds.So, do you read blogs regularly?  If you are reading this, then you must.  What do you look for in a good blog?  Are you looking for an escape?  Information?  Or just a nice place to spend a few minutes out of your busy day?  I would like to know."},
{"title": "Doodling", "date": "Monday, April 09, 2018", "text": "I am finding that I am having great fun with doodling.  I decided to sit and doodle some more last night and this is what I came up with after my cousin said I should draw some fruit.So, here is some fruit.Our new house has a large yard.  In fact, the whole lot is about a half acre and the house sits to the front of that so the back yard is large -- wider than deep.  The previous owner had done a lot of landscaping according to the neighbor but not much of it remains -- seems the things she did really weren't good for the house, like piling dirt in flower beds above the foundation line.  So, basically, the yard is a blank canvas and will stay that way, I think.  I rather like the serenity of a large, sprawling lawn.  Our neighbor's yard has been designated as an Audubon Society site for songbirds and we do have a lot of birds around.  On Friday I counted five robins in the yard.  I have never seen so many at one time!   I tried to get a photo but I wasn't quick enough.So, to do our part with the birds, we moved our birdbath and birdfeeders and put them outside the breakfast nook window where we could enjoy watching the little sparrows.  They aren't going to be little for long because they have emptied those feeders twice and they have only been out there for a few days.We haven't done anything with that flower bed yet because it has been too chilly but it will be cleaned out, the soil lowered away from the house and mulched.  If I put in flowers they will be in pots.  I can handle that.I have rambled away from the point of the post here -- the crisis.Well, it seems the former owner had hung a live wreath on the wall that had dried up and was needing to be discarded but we hadn't gotten to it yet.  The other day, while mowing, Hubs discovered a dove sitting on the dried up wreath -- clearly on eggs.  It was a great place for a nest -- under an eave, up high, well hidden. After watching her a couple of days we realized the eggs had hatched and there were two little hatchlings in the nest. However, yesterday, Hubs came in said he thought maybe something happened to Mommy Dove as there were feathers all over the ground below the wreath/nest and no bird in sight.  I went out and searched the whole yard -- the babies were screaming their heads off -- and no mommy to be found.I panicked.  I Googled how to care for baby birds and the best advice was to get in touch with a \"bird re-habber\" or rescue.  So, I located one or two in the area and went back out to look.  There was Mommy Dove behind the shrubs on the ground.  She didn't appear to be hurt so we left her alone.  She moved all over the ground but didn't get back up in the nest.  We felt sure she was ok so we went on about our business but kept an eye out because we do have a very large, ginger cat that makes it's way through our yard.  As we retired for the night, she still wasn't on the nest but we felt confident that she was close-by.When I got up this morning I checked and she was back up on the nest with everybody tucked in nice and snug.  I went out to take these photos and I checked -- Mommy is gone again but I did capture a baby sticking it's head out of the nest.  It seems to be the same color as the wreath so see if you can see the babe!Crisis over!"},
{"title": "Spring Break -- Installment Four", "date": "Saturday, April 07, 2018", "text": "We decided to extend our stay in Savannah an extra day because there is just so much to see.  An extra day could have turned into a week for me but we did need to move on since we only had a week.The second day was full of shopping and food and looking at all the gorgeous architecture.There are no tall buildings in Savannah, no skyscrapers -- I think the tallest building is four stories.  The tallest thing you will find in the city are church steeples -- this being one of the best examples. This is the Independent Presbyterian Church.  It has a rich history and you can read about it on the website at http://ipcsav.org/Another  outstanding example of Savannah churches is the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist.The exterior of this church is breathtaking but the inside is even more so.  You can visit their website as well at http://savannahcathedral.org/This is just a drop in the bucket in regards to the architecture. The mansions and row houses around the squares are gorgeous and the ironwork is so beautiful.  There is a lot of iron work on the homes and the story is that the wealthier you were the more iron you had on your house so there you go.the famous Mercer House -- owned by the singer John Mercer at one timeWe ate at two places while there -- The Cafe at City Market and The Six Pence Pub.  The Cafe at City Market was a very popular place, rustic in style and the food was great.  The Six Pence Pub, however, was fabulous.It is authenic, the food was wonderful -- I had the shepherd's pie and salad -- and if you want to see it in action it is one of the locations in \"Something to Talk About\" with Julia Roberts.  I would go back -- right now -- I wonder when the next flight is?And, then, of course, you have to do a little shopping.  There were great shopping places -- one called Silver Silk and Beads had gorgeous silver pendants that were designed reminiscent of the elaborate iron work you see around the city.  Gorgeous but I decided to go to Twinkle  and buy a cute little turquoise cross body bag with matching bi-fold wallet (tiny but it works!) and pom pom key chain which I really needed -- I really did!It was a wonderful day -- the weather was gorgeous -- the citizens were excited about the upcoming St. Patrick's Day festival and everybody was decorating and feeling the festive atmosphere.  Personally, though, I am glad that we were gone before St. Patrick's Day because apparently it gets really rowdy -- people actually travel to attend so it isn't a totally local 'thing'.The first day we used the trolley and my knees were thankful -- sort of -- climbing on and off those buses wasn't easy -- but the second day we walked everywhere and decided to take a Ghost Tour that evening.It was a grand tour that included dinner at The Pirate House -- a restaurant housed in a building that was built in 1734 making it the oldest building in Georgia.  The meal was lovely -- although a LOT of food --my meal alone could have fed all four of us -- and it was ended with  a tour of the basement -- the very haunted basement.  Do I believe in ghosts?  Yes.  Did I see or feel any?  No.  With that said, the entire atmosphere of the city seems charged with excitement.  Does that have anything to do with the paranormal activity that is supposedly strong or was it just St. Patrick's Day?  I don't know but next time I go I definitely want to go to the CVS that is built on the site of the original jail -- seems that the spirits like to turn over shelving on the customers. Sounds like fun!The next day saw us sadly heading out of Savannah toward Birmingham Alabama.  While there we visited the  16th Street Baptist Church which was the site of the 1963 bombing that killed four little girls.  We learned that two of these girls were Girl Scouts which made it even sadder -- these girls were apparently strong examples of what we all want our daughters to be -- smart, leaders, caring -- what a shame.  The whole area was sad -- the park across the street that was dedicated to these girls with statues and plaques was just so sad. I remember the events at that church but it seems much more recent than 1963.Leaving there we headed to our hotel where we discovered that we were just too tired to go eat.  So, the Hubs and the Daughter walked across the street to a Publix and bought the makins for a picnic in our hotel room.  It was a great change from restaurant food -- even as lovely as it had been.Finally, the morning found us rising and shining and heading out for the 12 hour drive back to Fort Worth.  It was a long, hard drive (it rained the entire way across Mississippi) and I was so glad to see a Whataburger!  Exhaustion set in, and we were glad to see our own bed.  It took me about three days to recover.Would I do it again?  You bet -- with some changes -- I would choose to go to Savannah -- on an airplane -- and stay in downtown where I could walk to everything.  But yes -- and I probably will!Last night I was restless. I think I was tired and my knees were hurting and I wanted to do something but not too much of something.  All my sewing was upstairs and I just couldn't be bothered to climb the stairs so....I decided to draw.  Now, you must understand that while my father was a very good artist and made a living at it, I didn't inherit the gene.  I knew this so I never even tried.  However, as many people do as they age, I have a new appreciation of art and enjoy a number of aspects of it.Obviously fine art, painting, sculpture, etc is all art but I look at quilting, cross stitch, and paper crafts (i.e. cardmaking) as art as well.  I love the complexity of mixed media projects and have worked on a couple of those as well.  I was right on board with the new adult color book craze and love it -- I am going to indulge myself in a full set of prismacolor pencils as soon as I can find a full set someplace!But, what I would really like to do is be able to draw.  I used to marvel at my father's ability to just sit and draw effortlessly.  The detail in his work was amazing (he was a cartoonist) and I would just shake my head not really knowing how he did it and being a bit resentful that I couldn't.I will never be an artist but I have discovered that is ok.  Art is in the eye of the beholder and while I will never have the talent that my father did I can still play with it.So, last night that is what I did.  I opened the internet and searched for sketching ideas and found a couple of things and gave it a go.  I was surprised to find that it was actually relaxing and not stressful because, after all, art is in the eye of the beholder, right?So, here you go--Art -- MY way!this is a vase in my kitchen -- this was done a few weeks agoagain with the vasejust the posya duck I copied off the internetA penguin I copied off the interneta fantasy flower and a magical bee from my imaginationmore of the sameSo, that is what I did last night -- huge waste of time but it was very relaxing -- I  might do it again tonight!"},

I didn't know what to expect but I was anxious to read them.I have finished all three and have purchased #4.  These are clean, cozy mysteries about Carlita Garlucci, her husband Vinnie, a crime boss, and their four children.  As the series begins, Vinnie has died and left Carlita with more than a few things to figure out, including an envelope, a key and a deed to some property in historic downtown Savannah.All of this leads to a new life for Carlita and her family -- one away from organized crime but chock full of mystery everywhere she turns.These books are quick reads, not terribly complex but great fun.  I recommend them and will continue to enjoy the series."},

It is the last bad eating habit I have.  I don't generally eat cake or pie and never bake them and with a diabetic hubby, I don't buy candy, so my bad eating habit is cookies and they needed to go. I didn't eat a cookie for a full month.  I felt so much better -- noticeably so.  Then I fell off the wagon.  I have eaten cookies again -- not in the same amount and not as often but I have eaten them in the past and I could feel a huge difference in how I felt.So.......back on the wagon.And you know, with all those cookies you would think I would feel all sweet and nice but no, I felt all grumbly and cross and bogged down. Therefore, no more cookies.Back to Spring Break and the new book series I am reading!"},
{"title": "Spring Break -- Installment Three", "date": "Thursday, March 29, 2018", "text": "We pick up leaving Nashville and its rain and snow -- yes, snow.  I wasn't thrilled -- and head toward Savannah.  My daughter assured me that I would love Savannah and what can I say -- she knows me well.  Three days was not enough.Our goal in Savannah was to visit the Juliet Gordon Low birthplace since it was Girl Scout Day the day we were there.  We joined another group and took a tour of the Low home and learned about her life and how she started the Girl Scouts of America.monument in one of the squares  gate in the back garden of the Low homeVeranda of the Juliet Gordon Low birthplaceI don't mind telling you it was an absolutely gorgeous home and was furnished with many of the Low personal effects.  The bathroom was over the top -- for the time.  Who doesn't want a toilet that looks like an elephant? I think the photo is on my husband's camera.  Sorry.After spending quite a bit of time at the Low home we visited the first headquarters of the GSA which was housed in the carriage house owned by Juliet Gordon Low's father-in-law.  It was very interesting because it was a bit of a museum with examples of past uniforms (oh, how they have changed) and many marketing items like dolls.  They even had a copy of the handbook that I had, as well as my uniform.  The handbook could be contemporary but the uniform was really dated.plaque at the GSA headquartersAfter leaving the GSA behind we did a bit of walking around the various squares.  Savannah is made up of sixteen squares, each named after a person significant to the history of the city.  Each square has monuments to something or somebody, benches and the most gorgeous foliage you have ever seen.  The azaleas were blooming profusely and the moss in the trees was swaying in the breeze.  It sounds ridiculous to say, but it looked like a postcard.I was a bit hobbled with my knees and all but thanks to their lovely trolley tours I was able to see many sites and get dropped off at various places to explore and get back on the trolley to go to the next stop without excessive walking.  It was a godsend.We decided that ice cream sounded like a lovely idea since Savannah is the home of Leopold's -- an ice cream shop that has been around for almost a hundred years.  There is always a line and this day was no different.So, as the rest of the group stood in line, I decided to wait it out at one of the outdoor tables where I struck up a conversation (as I am so apt to do, much to everybody's chagrin) with a lady who was also sitting it out.  We chatted until her companions arrived and I went to leave and they told me to stay so the chatting continued.  One of her friends was named Barbara.  We talked about why we were there visiting and where we came from and we were surprised to learn we both came from San Antonio.  The conversation, of course, veered to school and who knew who and we said -- at the same time -- that we went to Edison!  Seems she graduated in 65 and I in 68.  We started naming off people we knew and yes, we knew the same people.  This is such a perfect example of what a small world it is.So, after all that and getting the ice cream we set off walking again.  At this point we decided to revamp our plans and stay an extra day in Savannah and forgo our stop at Vicksburg, Mississippi. In retrospect, we should have done it differently still but I just wanted an extra day in Savannah because I wasn't done!More to come about Savannah, Day 2.    The photos above are just random offerings by the Bean.  She commandeered my camera and she wasn't very selective about what she snapped! So, I have to thank my daughter for letting me use some of her photos."},
{"title": "A Memory of Violets by Hazel Gaynor", "date": "Wednesday, March 28, 2018", "text": "I just finished reading \"A Memory of Violets\" by Helen Gaynor.  It was recommended to me by a friend a few weeks ago and after reading a snippit of it I had to acquire the book and read on.It is a book about sisters Florrie and Rosie who were part of the flower selling community in the East End of London in the late 1800's.  It is also a book about Tilly and Esther, sisters as well, who lived in the Lake District and even though the four girls came from different backgrounds they all had severe burdens to bear and their stories were entwined to make a compelling story.It was a very sad story of loss -- lots of loss -- and hardship -- much of that as well but also the story of a benefactor so benevolent that he saved the lives and made homes for hundreds of homeless, destitute, crippled and blind girls in the area.  It was heartwarming.This is clearly a period novel based on the life and work of John Groom -- Albert Shaw in the book.  The other characters, Flossie and Rosie, Tilly and Esther and a whole host of others were fictional, based on knowledge of the flower girls that had been written about previously.I had a hard time putting the book down because of the delightful twists and turns -- letters written, diaries kept. It was interesting and I learned a bit about the Eliza Doolittle's of London.  It was sad all along but the ending was poignant and very satisfying.I recommend."},
{"title": "Spring Break -- Installment Two", "date": "Sunday, March 18, 2018", "text": "After we left Little Rock we headed to Memphis.  We saw the Mississippi River but we didn't see Graceland.  We did, however, see Margie's 901 Ice Cream.  It was really good and really expensive but not as expensive as the parking -- $13 to park the car for about 30 minutes.  That is highway robbery!It is a locally owned shop featuring homemade ice cream and cakes.  It was delicious and I would recommend it if you are in the Memphis area.Leaving Memphis we were back on the road to Nashville.  We got there in time for dinner which we ate at Jim 'n Nicks -- a really nice barbecue place with these ---These were the most luscious cheese biscuits I have ever tasted.  The food overall was exceptional and I would definitely go back to this place if I am ever in the area again.Shortly thereafter Bean fell asleep at the table and we headed off to the hotel for a good night's sleep -- I love Marriott's beds -- I always get a good night's sleep there.The next morning we set out to visit the Country Music Hall of Fame and what fun that was! It was raining and miserable outside so this was a great place to spend half the day.Entrance to the exhibitThe main exhibit was Loretta LynnIn the Taylor Swift Educational Center the kids could do crafts -- Bean did a backstage pass!We ate lunch at a Mexican restaurant in the Country Music Hall of Fame and it was rather odd -- Mexican food in a very American museum and all they were playing was 60's British rock music!  Very odd, indeed!So, after lunch we headed to the Tennessee State Museum.  It was a lovely museum that reminded me of the Institute of Texan Cultures.  However, by the time we got there my knees were done and I sat most of the visit and missed quite a few things, like their quilt collection. When we finished with the museum we decided to look for dinner.  The weather was horrible, flooding, deluge rain.  It was not a pleasant day -- it only got worse.Headed back to the area of the hotel we had a car accident -- a person lost control of the car in the rain, slid in front of us, my daughter was braking but hit them anyway, they did a 360, bounced off the retaining wall and came back to hit us two more times.  We were fine but there is damage to the car. Unfortunately the driver of the other car was taken to the hospital. We finally found dinner at Olive Garden.Returning to our hotel room we learned that there was a chance of snow that night.  I figured it wouldn't.  I was wrong.  It snowed.We left the next morning and I have to say I couldn't get out of Tennessee fast enough.Next installment -- Savannah!"},

{"title": "This and That", "date": "Saturday, February 24, 2018", "text": "It is yet another rainy day here in the Fort.  The yard at Brinkley Cottage is beginning to resemble a swamp.  The weathermen keep saying \"we need the rain\".  I beg to differ.  It is supposed to be gone later today. So, since neither one of us feel like slopping around to go shopping (maybe later when it dries up a bit) we are really just messing around the house.I am very proud of myself.  In spite of my gimpy knees, I have started walking -- or gliding -- on my Tony Little Gazelle.  I have to say, though, that it is the most boring thing on earth to do.  I have a television close by but my husband's music room is right next door and he plays lots of music which is good but doesn't alleviate the boredom and I can't watch the television with the music going.So, the next best thing is to read.  So, upstairs I trot this morning to \"walk\" with Kindle in hand.  Well, the Kindle won't set on the machine so I asked my husband to solve the problem.  I was thinking of a way to tie the thing on, or a little pouch or something.  My husband is a flipping genius.  Here was his solution:He had some blue tack sitting right there so he chunked a piece of it on the machine and voila! it held my Kindle just fine.  Brilliant.So, I figured while I was up there I would take a few photos of my sewing area.  One of the reasons we moved here was so that I could have a sewing area and here it is:If I ever give up sewing this would make a great reading nookJust ignore those boxes on the shelves and the fact that I haven't hung pictures yet.  That may be what I do today.  Unpack boxes and hang pictures.I have done a little decorating in the upstairs powder room however and here it is:I have to hang the cross stitch yet but I thought it picked up the colors in the towels and the vase quite well.  I will take another photo when I get it hung.  I loved doing those cat cross stitch patterns.  I can't remember what they are called -- Kats by Kelly or something like that.  Great fun.And last of all is a shot of our stairway.  It is steep and evil but it is giving me lots of exercise.  I think it might actually be helping my knees.At the top, under that light, I am going to hang my \"travel\" cross stitch projects.  I have the one of the Old North Church and one of the Alamo.  I am working on the Alamo chart now and you can see it in the photo above of my sewing space.  We are going on a quick little getaway later in the spring and I have decided that my souvenirs will be books on the areas we visit and small cross stitch charts of something historic in the area.I haven't been buying books lately.  I have been borrowing them from the library through Overdrive for my Kindle.  However, one title that is in my queue wasn't available on an e-book format so I am waiting for it to be shipped to the library close to my house.  So, in the meantime, I am reading yet another Cedar Cove installment that I downloaded on Overdrive.  BUT -- my husband wanted to go  to Half  Price Books and I picked up these two titles --I have been wanting to read \"The Curious Charms of Arthur Pepper\" for a while but it hasn't been available in an e-book so when I saw it I just though I would read a real physical book.  \"The Girl from the Savoy\" is by the same author as the book I am waiting for from the library -- \"A Memory of Violets\".  I started reading it a bit in the shop and it looks good so I am going to give it a go.Now I am going to go direct the hubs to hang some pictures.  Yay!"},

I took naproxyn a long time ago for my knees and they prescribed it with caution.  Now that I can get it over the counter, it is easy to get but not any easier to take.  So, it is aspirin or nothing.  We all know that Tylenol doesn't do anything for an inflammation so I don't bother.I have also been using all manner of topical products -- Aspercreme, Salonpas, rubbing alcohol, Absorbine Jr. -- whatever I can get my hands on.  It helps, for a little while.So, I decided to do a little research on DIY approaches to the problem. I am a fan of apple cider vinegar so I studied that first.  Of course, they talk about drinking it which I have done for years.  I will be doing that again.  But....they also talked about making an ointment of it by mixing 2 tbs. vinegar with 1 tbs. coconut oil and rubbing it on and using it at night. I made the ointment last night but it didn't mix up,  I need to heat the oil since oil and vinegar don't mix! I got it mixed up enough, however, to rub it on my knees and I went to bed.Last night was the first night I have slept so pain free and so soundly.I will do it again and see if it really does work but I got up this morning and, while I am still limping and all, I am not hurting as badly.Hmmm...who knew."},

{"title": "Intuitive Eating", "date": "Tuesday, February 20, 2018", "text": "For the last couple of months I have been following the principles of intuitive eating.Basically it involves eating what you want following certain guidelines.  It isn't a \"diet\".  It is about listening to your body and recognizing what your body is needing.I can't really remember when I started doing this but I went to the doctor in November with my knees.  I weighed X.  When I went a few weeks later, with the flu, I weighed X-9.  I felt like I had lost weight but I certainly hadn't been trying.  I gave up soda years ago but with the flu all I wanted was 7 up so I had 7 up.  When I was well, I didn't want it anymore and I haven't had anymore.So, what happens is you get in touch with your body's hunger cues.  There are some visuals and graphs out there to help you and I feel like the best thing to do is to start in the morning, when you are empty, and see what it feels like to be empty.  Take a look at the chart below so you can get some idea where you are in your hunger and see where you want to be.  Ultimately you want to be at 5 or 6.  When you get there you stop eating and don't eat again until you are hungry. This came from immaeatthat.com (Yes, I spelled it correctly!)Another visual that you can carry with you all the time is your fist.  Your stomach is about the size of your clenched fist.  That is the same amount of food it will take to get you to #5 on the chart above. So, when you go to the restaurant clench your fist, look at the size and look at the food on your plate.  Chances are there is enough food there to pack up and take home for another meal.  That should say something for the portions in restaurants.So, yes, this is about portion control as well. It is more about portion control and your body's hunger cues than what you are eating. Eat what you want within the guidelines above.  And sometimes you won't, you will eat more, but it is all about balance. Dessert?  Yes, when it is appropriate, making sure that you stay at 5-6 on the chart.Sounds easy, right?  In the beginning it isn't -- especially if you are a dieter and used to following \"rules\" about what to eat, when to eat, when not to eat, what to avoid.  However, after a while of doing this it becomes second nature.  If you eat slowly you can anticipate when you are approaching that 5-6 slot on the chart.   Follow that old etiquette trick -- put your fork down between bites and chew your food well.  You will soon recognize when your hunger is satisfied.I was never a breakfast eater.  My mother had to struggle with me to get some toast/tea down me before school.  Of course, halfway to lunch I always ended up with a headache only relieved by lunch.  The problem then?  Having to eat breakfast too early.  Now, I don't eat when I first get up.  I am up at least an hour and a half before I eat.What is my usual breakfast?  I am trying to make good choices so my breakfast usually involves oatmeal laced with raisins, blueberries, cinnamon, butter, and honey.  Today I added some strawberries that were going to go bad if I didn't use them.  I am pretty lactose intolerant so I use Lactaid.  I don't like all the rice milks and almond milks.  I have tried.  Not going to happen.I am satisfied.  I am at a 5.  I feel like I have made good choices.I am planning lunch out because that is what we do and we got a bunch of restaurant gift cards for Christmas.  There is a lovely restaurant around the corner from us that is American/Italian home cooking.  I have looked at the menu and am thinking the salmon looks delish. We will eat a very light dinner after lunch out.  Soup, toast, cheese and crackers -- just light fare.  We have both learned that we feel better and sleep better going to bed at about a 3-4 on the scale. So, I have fallen off the plan what with the Girl Scout cookies in the house.  Today I am consciously dealing with that.  Am I going to eat some?  Yeah.  But only when it is appropriate and in a reasonable amount.  Why?  Because if I keep the chart and the fist in mind, it will be ok.Now I am going to take my gimpy knee upstairs and try to walk on my Tony Little Gazelle.  I am sure it isn't going to be good but we will see."},
{"title": "Time to Grow Up and Put On The Big Girl Panties", "date": "Monday, February 19, 2018", "text": "Yep, it is time to grow up.  Time to take charge. Time to do the right thing and I know what it is.I have severe arthritis in my knees.  It hurts like -- just add whatever descriptive word you prefer here.I have had cortisone shots, had fluid drained, done exercise, rubbed it with all manner of \"stuff\" and, while it helps, it isn't a \"fix\".  I feel sure that the only \"fix\" is surgery but I don't want to do that.The thing that I keep hearing is lose weight.  I need to lose weight.  I have needed to lose weight for years.I know that the only thing that is going to help my knees is weight loss.I have been doing the moderation thing, I have been using a couple of visuals to keep my eating under control and it was working.  I lost 9 lbs.  I didn't count anything, journal anything -- nothing -- just eating when I was hungry, not eating when I wasn't and trying to make good choices.Then came the Girl Scout cookies.  I'll just leave that here.Tomorrow I have to go back to \"the plan\".  I have to do this or I won't be able to walk. I am not being over-reactive in saying that.  It is a fact that I have to face and if I don't do something about it that is what my future holds.So, here I go!PS -- I gave up soda and never went back surely I can give up cookies!  Nona -- that is the name I go by most often nowadays.  Even my little Brownies call me Nona.  Well, Nona has just had a couple of cra-cra moments lately.As everybody knows, we moved house in late November or early December-- I can't remember which.  We got most of our things moved and then things went downhill quickly so we are still a bit scattered with a lot of stuff at the other house.  Moving the rest of our stuff was put off what with illness (dreaded flu) and MIL getting sick and passing on.  So, I didn't think much about it all until I started missing things.Wanting to make an angel food cake, it occurred to me that I had no idea where my hand mixer was. Looking for shoes that wouldn't hurt my feet I realized that I had lost my Tieks.I looked everywhere for both these items and simply couldn't find them.So, back to the old house I tore up everything I could to find them.  I packed up most of the rest of the kitchen thinking that I would run across the mixer.  I went through bags of stuff for charity shops thinking I just tossed the Tieks. Nothing, nada, no go.I was bummed so I came home and went into my closet.I moved a pair of sandals and what do you suppose I found?  No, not the mixer but I did find the flats.Then yesterday morning I went into the kitchen to make some breakfast and I couldn't remember where I put the griddle.  Well, there is one cabinet that I forget I have -- I don't know why, it is a galley kitchen but this one cabinet completely eludes me and since I don't use the griddle on a daily basis -- well -- you can see where this is going.So, I open the cabinet to see if that is where the griddle was and voila! Yes, the griddle was there and so was -- the handmixer.  All very organized and lined up neatly. I can't believe that I couldn't remember bringing the thing home or putting it away so neatly but there it is!And I was very glad to find my shoes.I will be glad when everything gets moved so I can finally have all my stuff here and I won't look so idiotic when I \"lose\" things.The last couple of months have been very hectic and scattered and I need to feel grounded.I think I will go to the other house and move some more stuff.Have a wonderful day!"},
{"title": "Rainy Saturday", "date": "Saturday, February 17, 2018", "text": "It is a chilly, rainy Saturday here at Brinkley cottage.  The rain is suppose to stop by about noon.  We need it because the threat of grass fires has been great of late and we have had quite a few.  Scary things to watch, for sure.Our day was supposed to be going to our other house and continuing to move boxes of things.  We are down to a manageable amount -- we just need to get it done now and I was hoping the weather would cooperate today.  Maybe later this afternoon. Yesterday I had the baby granddaughter, Emily, here for a while.  She is three and loves to be read to.  I found it very poignant that I was reading her books that were originally her father's.  Funny how that is -- when we are small we never think of people outside the realm in which we know them --like our parents were never 3 years old!  If I  don't go to the other house I am not sure what the day holds except that the Bean is going to be here for the night.  She is into watching the Buddies movies -- the ones with the big golden retrievers -- and I think she has watched all of them.  Two or three times.  So, we might have to see what the current offerings are. I guess I will have to start taking Aleve again for my knees although I really don't like it but it seems to be the only thing that really reduces the inflammation.  I bought some new shoes -- skechers slip ons.  Not sure about them so I am only wearing them around the house right now until I see if I need to return them.  Oddly, they are quite wide and I am wondering if I needed a half size smaller but then I fear they would be too short.  Like I said in the previous post, I think I would be more successful with wearing the boxes.Well, I have nothing earth shattering to report or comment on.  Deeply saddened by the events of the week -- it just casts a black cloud over everything.  So, I guess I will go have a bit of breakfast and get on with the day.  Hopefully I will get a bit livelier later today and have more to talk about!"},
{"title": "How The Brinkley's Do Shrove Tuesday", "date": "Tuesday, February 13, 2018", "text": "Easter is my favorite religious holiday.  I can't explain it but that is the way it has always been for me.  This year is no different.Shrove Tuesday -- Fat Tuesday-- Mardi Gras -- whatever you want to call it is chock full of fun!It started out with the Mardi Gras parade at Bean's school.  It is always a colorful, lively, musical, fun filled event even though it was a little cold.And then, we had our annual Shrove Tuesday Pancake Dinner at church!  Bacon and sausage and eggs -- oh my!  And pancakes and waffles and toppings!  Coffee, tea, milk and juice.  Quite the spread all cooked by our own and served up -- a good time was had by all.Such a good time!And now -- Lent.I haven't said much about it here but I am currently dealing with a good deal of pain from \"very severe osteoarthritis of the knee\" as per my orthopedic surgeon.I have had shots and done exercise and taken meds and rubbed all manner or ointments and gels and whatnot on the poor, delicate joints.  In mid-December it was if nothing was going on -- my knees were great and I was feeling no pain.  Then the cold weather came and I am hobbling around again.I suspect, since I pretty much feel like the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz, that my arthritis issue isn't just in my knees.  My feet give me lots of issues as well and now my hip, my neck, and my hands.  Except for my hands, I think all the other issues are just amplified by the gimpy knees -- I just don't walk right. I limp, my weight isn't evenly distributed and speaking of weight -- well, there's that, isn't there?So, in trying to be objective I have been observing myself and taking note of what feels good and what doesn't in regards to footwear.I have also been doing some reading about earthing, or grounding, in an effort to relieve the knee pain and, while I am not sure it is a \"thing\", it is interesting reading and has made me curious about minimalist shoes. My left foot has a very high arch and sometimes, in certain shoes, when I get out of the car, I have to stand still for a bit because it seems like the bones in the top of my foot have to \"settle\" or get back into place.  I am sure the shoes I am wearing, which are a good, highly acclaimed brand, are squishing my foot into a shape it shouldn't be going in.I am happiest barefoot but it isn't feasible to go to the grocery store, or church, barefooted -- especially in freezing weather.  Around the house, on really cold days, I wear slippers but for the most part, I am barefooted.So, last night I did a search on shoes that would mimic being barefoot.  I did some reading that told me that people with knee arthritis do better with shoes that have a zero drop -- which means very flat -- and they should wear minimalist shoes that mimic being barefoot.  Of course, the next article in the queue said people with knee arthritis should wear trainers or athletic shoes with lots of padding and cushioning that lace up.  Lace up's are hard for me because of the one foot with the high arch.  Those sorts of shoes make my feet feel like they are suffocating.  I really liked my Tieks but I have very wide feet and they were just too narrow.So, what is a girl to do?  I have given thought to wearing the shoe box -- that might work better than anything I have tried so far.I did find, through my searching, a couple of places that had shoes that might work but again -- the wide feet are problematic.Vivobarefoot - had these--They look promising.  They also had these --These second ones have laces but I could try them.They both have very flexible soles and are lightweight.Not sure what to do about my wide feet -- I will have to talk to one of their reps about it.  And, they are a little pricey for making a mistake but I guess I just need to pony up and start returning things I buy by mail that aren't satisfactory.Like my new bedspread.But that is a completely different post.Guess I will go buy shoes."},

It is the 5th in the Cedar Cove Series.I am really enjoying this series  and have decided to read on through.  I could add something in between each installment but I am really engrossed in this story.  So, on I go.In \"50 Harbor Street\"  a lot of big changes happened.  Cecelia had her baby and all is well.  Anson is missing and in a lot of trouble.  The author of the postcards is revealed.  Cliff and Grace ....well, best read it for yourself.  Something is going on with absolutely everybody and I have come to one conclusion about this series --I would like to live in Cedar Cove.I just downloaded the 6th installment on my Kindle -- \"6 Rainier Drive\" -- from my local library.I love being able to download library books onto my Kindle.  I have given up being so stoic about print books -- I love this Kindle and will continue to use it. I can buy books, check books out of the library, and I can carry it in my purse.  I still buy books but I have run out of bookcase space and have many books on those shelves unread so I see no reason to continue to buy physical books when I can make good use of the library -- even if they are e-books!So, off I go to load the dishwasher, make a cake, finish some laundry, do a bit of vacuuming and ------- start the new installment!Happy Saturday!"},
{"title": "Facebook -- What to Do", "date": "Saturday, February 10, 2018", "text": "I have  been \"on\"  Facebook since its inception.  I remember signing up for it before it was clear what it was for.  That is a long time ago now.  I used to enjoy it.  Some of it I still do but....I am on several interesting sites and I comment and people comment back and we enjoy conversation about a mutually interesting subject. But...nobody reads my posts.I posted two reasonably interesting things yesterday -- one sort of sadly comical -- sad because it was true, comical because, well, it was true.  And, one with photos which I thought were interesting.No comments, no heads up that it was seen.I clearly don't have what it takes to be a facebooker. Should I quit?  Should I just lurk which is mostly what I do anyway? I read peoples posts and I comment.  I am invisible.Oh well......"},
{"title": "Art ", "date": "Friday, February 09, 2018", "text": "My dad was an artist.  I never had the interest until now.  I am now interested in all things art.  I can't really draw but I can color fairly well and I love to mess with fabric colors and threads and fibers and such.I think the term \"art\" is subjective -- it means many things to many people.My mother in law always said that when she retired she wanted to paint.  She always said she liked to draw as a girl and hoped to be able to spend some of her leisure years pursuing that interest.And she did.  All of her children have several of her paintings in their homes and we enjoy them on a daily basis.  On her passing, I asked if I could fall heir to her art supplies and such since I have a growing interest in the pursuit and so does my husband.  We came home with several boxes of supplies and books.I was going through the boxes of books yesterday and I came across a rather fragile, thin manilla mailing envelope addressed to my MIL at her childhood home.  The return address was torn off.  It was postmarked \"Dallas\", 1936 -- she would have been 15 at the time.The contents of the envelope were several pencil drawings in the style of the time, all people and all on manilla paper -- some of which were hole punched with reinforcements which led me to believe that she kept these in a binder of some sort.I feel deep down like she had submitted these for publication to a magazine.  There were no notes or names or identification of any sort.  If they were her artwork, she didn't sign them.  They are lovely drawings.  I am afraid they didn't photograph well but I will share a couple anyway.They are very fine line pencil drawings and I was standing in the way of the light but you get the idea.  I wonder if maybe she requested drawings from another artist?  I guess there are many ways she could have come upon these drawings but they are really nice.Art is in the eye of the beholder, right?  I love paintings and drawing and I really love photography.  But, because I am not good at any of those I lean toward fabric art.  I quilt, I do cross stitch and, from the looks of my stash, I collect fabric!In going through some of the boxes from the move, I ran across a couple of small cross stitch projects.  They are very small and very, very simple.  The kind of thing you can get done in an hour.  But I do love to do these sorts of things once in a while.The first one was a gift to me from my daughter -- a souvenir of their trip to Boston.  It is the Old North Church.  It was such fun to do.  The second was a gift from my husband during a trip to San Antonio.  I was quite ill on that trip and didn't get to do any sightseeing so my husband brought me a little pick me up from the Alamo.  This kit is almost five years old and it keeps getting put aside.  It is my next finish for sure.I have done many pieces that are much more complex but I like the small ones too.  I purchased a bookmark kit from the gift shop at Westminster Abbey and I loved making it so much, I made a second one for a friend.  When I run across it I will share a photo. Things are still sort of in chaos around here but it is getting better day by day and eventually I will know where all my things are -- maybe.I will be sure to share a photo of the little Alamo when I finish it.  I think I am going to have both pieces framed in large frames and I have the perfect place for them -- more on that later.So, off I go to see what \"new\" treasures I can find as I sift through boxes of all my earthly possessions chunked together.I will never move again, I don't think."},
{"title": "Jazzed Up", "date": "Wednesday, February 07, 2018", "text": "I decided I want it to be spring.  I don't have that kind of power in the real world but I do have that kind of power over my blog.So, I jazzed it up for spring. Snazzy, don'tcha think?Self Care -- sounds Self-Ish, doesn't it?  Apparently it is a buzz word amongst the Millennials.I am neither -- selfish or a millennial.However, I am a boomer and a female and that means that I was raised with a 50's sit-com mindset -- like vacuuming in heels and pearls.I was raised by a mother who believed the house should be clean -- all the time -- and the meals should be cooked -- from scratch -- by her and that she could solve everybody's problems.  My mother was a woman who was the consummate caretaker.She took care of everybody but herself.Even though I became a wife and mother in the 70's, my mother's beliefs were firmly imbedded in my brain.I became a caretaker.I became last. My parents have gone on to glory and my children have grown up and have families of their own.Here I am realizing that I should be taking better care of myself.Physically, yes, but emotionally and spiritually as well.  Changes need to be made.I am trying to form a few new habits.  New habits are hard to forge -- old habits are hard to break.  It is a conundrum.I have been following the \"moderation\" movement life plan for eating.  I have been using \"Thin Within\" as a guide.  Basically you listen to your body, eat when you are hungry, don't eat when you aren't, and stop when you are comfortable, not full.  Sounds simple.  It is.  But I got the flu and that sort of messed me up and I am trying to get back into the swing.  This method sort of makes you feel guilty -- like if you aren't counting something, or weighing or measuring stuff or keeping a diet journal you must be cheating.  But, you aren't.  You are just being real, normal (yes, there really is a normal), and eating like we used to when were --you know -- kids.  The whole premise is to listen to your body.After eating this way for a bit I have learned to pay attention to what my body is telling me.  My body doesn't like dairy products.  It upsets my stomach in ways you don't want to know.  If I use milk, like on cereal, I use Lactaid but sparingly.  My body also doesn't like sugar.  That is the tough one and the struggle is real.  I have learned that if my meals are roughly 1/3 protein, 1/3 carb and 1/3 fat, my body is pretty happy.  I try to include each of these in each meal.Eating isn't the only way to listen to your body.I am also listening to my memories.  I would love to be thin -- really thin -- and I was at one time when I dieted myself into a waif.  But that wasn't real.  I am not a waif.  I am not real tall, I am square with a thicker, high waist.  I have always been that way.  I have spent too many years trying to be something I am not -- I can't lower that waist no matter what I do so I think I need to be working on acceptance.I was also raised to believe that you couldn't \"play\" until your \"work\" was done -- homework, chores, housework later on -- so as a result -- I never get to \"play\".  That is changing.  Let's face it, the housework is never finished so I am going to change my attitude and my expectation -- after all, it isn't the 50's anymore!  So, there are certain things I do on a daily basis -- some laundry, the dishes, and I cook one meal a day.  I am abandoning the idea that I have to vacuum and dust the whole house in a day.  My knee won't let me do that  so I am doing a certain amount each day and then that is all.  I can start over again the next day and continue on.  After all -- housework never really gets done, right?And I will allow myself to \"play\" everyday, if  just for a half hour.I have been listening to my body in regards to sleep too.  I used to take a nap and now I don't.  I am suffering for that.  I start falling asleep about 8:30 every night.  I sleep in the chair until I get up and go to bed.  Clearly my body needs sleep.  So, I will be going to bed earlier from now on.Again, listening to my body.Another thing that is happening to me is that I am fraught with anxiety.  I am not sure why.  I never used to be but in the last six months I have been really miserable with  anxiety.  Hopefully having play time and addressing my sleep issues with help the anxiety issue.However, I think that in order to really combat the anxiety I need to look at my spiritual life.  I have made a couple of changes --simple changes but something I am having to concentrate on and make time for.  I always pray at night when I go to bed.  I don't always make it through the whole prayer because of my sleep issues but I do start out my night that way.  Now I have been making the effort to start my day the same way -- before I bound out of bed (I don't really \"bound\" anymore, creak, creep and crawl is more like it) I like to open my eyes and give thanks for another day.  Nothing long, nothing involved, just a thank you.  I think it sets the tone for the day.I have also downloaded a different Bible version on my Kindle -- it is called the Christian Standard Bible and it is written in plain English.  I am reading a chapter or two a day.  I really believe that getting into the Word will help my anxiety.  I am not sure that it is the best translation but I am reading it and that is the point.So, what does self care mean to you?  Spas?  A good cup of coffee?Yes, I agree, those things are good ways to care for yourself but I think the best thing is to examine how you are spending your time -- are you spending any of it on yourself?  If not, maybe changes should be made -- if you don't take care of yourself, you can't take care of anybody else.Play?  Play is good for mental health.  Everybody needs to play -- whether it is reading a book or doing a craft or baking a pie -- spend some time doing something that gives you joy.Physical awareness?  We should all take the time to be aware of ourselves, what our bodies and minds need.  We take care of everybody else's physical needs -- why not our own.Spiritual needs?  I believe we all have spiritual needs that are just as fundamental to our well being as what we eat.  I honestly believe that in order to be a strong, functional member of society, we need to be in touch with our spiritual selves.  Find a way, find the time, just do it.So, as you can see, I have been giving a bit of thought about the self-care concept and I believe this is something we can probably all learn more about and improve areas of our life but we can't wait for other's to do it for us -- this is all about us.So, just do it.My husband loves Celtic music.  I should with my ancestry and I do but it makes me want to cry.I have a cousin who was adopted into the family back when she was a baby in 1957.  She has unfriended me from Facebook (she got mad at me) and she acts like she is a member of the family and I am not.  I am not exactly sure what to do with this so I am going to leave it here.I am toying with the idea of sewing clothes for myself again.  It didn't work when I was a svelte little thing -- I doubt it is going to be any better now.  Maybe I should stop thinking about this.I decided to vacuum today.  I am ashamed to say that I don't vacuum very often.  I believe it is good exercise though and I should do it every day.  It really wears me out.We are having winter again.  A couple of days ago we were having summer.  I am too old for all this changing about.  I hate to think about changing the time again ....too old for that as well.When I get finished vacuuming, I am going to sit down and read and read and read and then....I am going upstairs to find a cross stitch project.Something about moving has made me interested in doing all the things I used to do.  I think I feel energized here and my other house depressed me.  I have no rational reason for that.I am having sushi for lunch!  Yay!PS -- should I jazz up my blog?"},

{"title": "Shoes -- A Problem", "date": "Saturday, February 03, 2018", "text": "For some reason, back in November, my knees have gotten considerably worse with arthritis.  Bad enough to send me to an orthopedic surgeon where I was given a cortisone shot and told to exercise my knees.  I am a candidate for knee replacement surgery sometime in the future but not now -- and if you ask me, not ever.I am pretty sure I have arthritis in all my joints but because I am heavier than I should be I think it is hitting my lower, weight bearing joints the worst.  My left ankle is giving me a lot of trouble right now.  I have had three severe sprains in it and now that I seem to be giving to my knee a great deal it is acting up as well. I am a structural hot mess.So, I am noticing that one pair of shoes that I wear frequently is making things worse for my knees and my ankle.  This is them --They are very easy to slip on and off and they look nice on my feet but there is absolutely no support and I guess they have stretched a bit because my feet slide all over in them making my ankle and knee wobble.  Mostly my ankle.I have a pair of Clark's flats that work fairly well -- they are so old I can't find a photo of them!I have a pair of Grasshopper ortho-lites that feel ok but with my high arches I don't do well in lace up shoes but it seems that if I am not in the ones pictured above, I am in those.The problem is that I think all of my shoes are making my foot issues worse.I am thinking of trying Tom's.  I need something I can just slip on.  I am afraid I inherited my father's feet and he couldn't wear lace -ups either. Suggestions anybody?"},
{"title": "What Goes Around Comes Around -- My House", "date": "Thursday, February 01, 2018", "text": "That old saying, \"what goes around comes around\" usually refers to your actions being revisited on you.  Today, I am using it in regards to my house.My husband and I were married in 1972 -- the era of avocado green, harvest gold and pumpkin.  None of them my favorite colors.  However, we did use them because, like everything else, that was what was popular so that is what we could mostly get.I came into the marriage with an Early American bedroom suite -- mine from childhood (although it wasn't childish) complete with a four poster bed, a dresser with mirror and a chest of drawers.This bedroom furniture set the tone for future purchases and, before too long, we had  an apartment full of Early American furniture thanks to a manufacturing company known as Tell City Furniture.Our first purchase together was a drop leaf table.This is not my table but it is the same table.  My husband liked the table but he wasn't crazy about the fact that I set up an account, in his name, at a local furniture store and purchased this table, in his name, before he even had a job right out of college.  I think he feared that was how things were going to go.  His fear was validated.  The table now sits in my new dining room.So, ten months after we were married we bought our first house -- a little, mid-century tract house in the neighborhood in which my husband grew up and only a few blocks from where I grew up.  A larger space required more furniture.  One of the pieces we purchased was this table for our kitchen.Yes, this was another Tell City piece that has served us well for many years. It is now sitting upstairs and being used as a game table.So, as things usually go, we started a family which required us to build on to the house and yet more furniture was bought in the same style and so on it went.  We moved to Ft. Worth in 1990 and acquired a larger house which required a bit more furniture and that is when we strayed from our tried and true Early American style.It wasn't in style anymore and  you couldn't really find much of it.  So, we did the wrought iron tables with glass tops, lazy boy recliner furniture, new bedroom furniture that was more English than Early American sort of thing -- we became eclectic.Moving to the next house which was Country French in style and very ornate required us to buy bigger and yet a different style of furniture.  My much loved and used Early American furniture was put into storage after we after we dipped our little pink toes in the pond of sophistication!Fast forward to now --  we have moved again to a house that is considerably less ornate.  It is bigger but plainer.  The woodwork is not massive and the lower ceilings not coffered.  It is a bigger house yet but much more conventional, straight forward and actually useful.I needed more furniture so what did I do?Took all my Early American furniture out of storage and am re-using it in my new house.  I asked my husband why this house seemed so familiar, so comfortable, so homey.  He just looked at me and said \"because it looks a lot like our first home, our apartment\". And he was right.  I have furnished it with the same stuff, I have put the same sorts of bedspreads on the beds, we now have venetian blinds and not shutters -- yes, it is like coming home again.Apparently, what goes around DOES come around."},

Beaton.I seem to alternate between both offerings but right now I am focusing on Cedar Cove because, to me, it is written like a soap opera.  It is easy to read and it goes quickly, at least on my Kindle.I seem to read faster on an e-reader.  Do you?  I wonder why.I just finished book three, 44 Cranberry Point which focused on Grace and Cliff, Olivia and Jack (of course), and Bob and Peggy Beldon -- and, naturally the mysterious stranger who wound up dead in the Beldon's B&B, Thyme and Tide. I am starting on the fourth book, 50 Harbor Street, which, from  perusing page 1, appears to be focusing on the McAfees and the mysterious letters and gifts they have been receiving.  It seems ominous but they can't be sure.  Maybe we will find out in this \"episode\".Fortunately I have been able to obtain all but one of these books from my public library on Overdrive.  I love that feature and almost never have a problem finding something that I am looking for.  I have a feeling I am not going to stop reading until I have finished the series.  There are twelve books and some supplementals so it will keep me going for a while.  I hope I continue to be interested in the story lines -- it seems like it would be difficult to keep it going for that long but we will see.Ok, back to reading!"},

SO....this past weekend we were in our hometown laying my mother-in-law to rest.  The last time I couldn't get photos off the phone I swore never to use anything but my trusty little point and shoot Nikon camera.Well, with the half-move and all I can't find the charger or the case so I decided to just take the phone.  Of course, I had forgotten that I can't transfer the photos.  So.....Yep, isn't it ironic."},
{"title": "Trying to Get Normal", "date": "Thursday, January 25, 2018", "text": "Normal -- what is that even?  I don't know that there is such a thing as normal since there are probably as many \"normals\" as there are people.  However, for me, what my life has been since mid-December is definitely NOT normal.  And I am not happy about it.  It has been implied that I am being selfish but I don't think so.Since we partially moved in mid-December we have had a few glitches along the way which have made it much more difficult than it should have been. In the first place, not trusting the moving company, I chose to pack and move by car many boxes.  That was a mistake.  The movers were excellent and I should have just let them take everything.  I should have let them PACK everything.  There won't be a \"next move\" but if there was I would do things differently in that respect.Then as I was trying to unpack and plan for Christmas I was slapped upside the head by the flu.  After about week three I was wondering if I was ever going to get over it.  I am still wondering because I don't feel 100% even yet.Then my mother in law took a turn for the worst and wound up in the hospital in a rapid decline.  I was totally freaked out because the emergency room was completely full -- the hospital was full, actually -- of flu patients.  In the ER they had the gurneys lined up two deep against the walls and in one part of the waiting room.  They were masking everybody and I never felt more exposed in all my life.My MIL was a week in the hospital when they finally moved her to hospice where she spent less than 24 hours before going home to glory.  That was the easy part.Then came planning the funeral and burial.  I will tell you that dealing with the military is not an easy task.  She is buried in a national cemetery with her husband but it was a two week wait for the burial and another week for us to have a memorial service which will be this Saturday.  There has been much communication between my husband and the funeral home (she purchased a funeral in 1977!) and the cemetery.  They can't seem to get the names spelled correctly which has been a real source of aggravation for my husband.  Hopefully that has been resolved but not sure.  And the paperwork has been ridiculous but thankfully, in this day and age, it was able to be done electronically and we didn't have to make an extra trip there to get it all tied up.Then, because this event is out of town (nobody lives there anymore, everybody is scattered) and happening right before lunch, we needed to make plans for lunch for everybody.  The immediate family numbers 33.  Yes, you read that right -- immediate family = 33.  That is children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  There are 5 nieces and nephews coming as well.  There is one restaurant that we know of that could accommodate a party that large so we set about booking it.  Their guidelines are very rigid.  We had to choose a menu because ordering off the regular menu is not allowed.  We have gone round and round trying to plan this gathering.  Honestly, it has been the hardest part.So, why has it been implied that I am being selfish?  Because I am a tad upset about not being finished moving or being done with unpacking.  I guess it appears that I am thinking about myself and not about the family's loss.  That isn't true but I am finding that the older I get being surrounded by clutter and disorder gives me great anxiety.  I still have boxes stacked up that I am trying to empty but it is a slow go on my own and now I have many of my mother in law's boxes to deal with as well. For every box I unpack, three more come in the door! It will improve this weekend as I deliver boxes of earthly possessions to her children but for now I am just a bit annoyed that my house still looks like moving and storage.  Also, I have asked my husband to relocate some things he unceremoniously dumped on my kitchen counter and he hasn't done it yet (about three weeks ago I asked) because he is trying to help somebody spell his name -- it isn't difficult. Hubs has assured me that next week all will be different -- we will be back on track and we can get back on our usual routine.  I am not sure I remember what that was but I do know that I have a lot of appointments to reschedule so I guess I will be doing a lot of that stuff.  And moving.  Some more.Oh, did I mention that my seasonal allergies have kicked in?Is it too late for Bah-humbug?"},

{"title": "Moving is Enlightening -- The Upside to Hoarding", "date": "Monday, December 18, 2017", "text": "They say you never really know a person until you live with them.  I believe that to be true.  I can expand on that -- you never really know yourself until you move.Twelve years ago we moved from Wakeland Manor to Maison Brinkley.  It was a disaster -- we only moved what we needed and we held on to the rest way too long.  We finally hired a skip and tossed and tossed and tossed.  It was cathartic. Moving along to the current move from Maison Brinkley to Brinkley Cottage.  We had acquired more stuff, of course, we are human after all.  But, since I have been trying to organize my home more logically things weren't as helter skelter as they were at Wakeland Manor.  I packed like things with like things and labeled the boxes very well.  The movers were great about putting the boxes where they should be. I didn't pack my kitchen though, until yesterday, and it still isn't done.  I did bring home six boxes of things and have managed to put most away.  Surprisingly, the new kitchen, which I thought was smaller, actually has a lot of storage so I am pleased.  In any event, dealing with the kitchen stuff really makes me wonder what sort of disease I have.There is no reason for a person to have four cookie sheets, two mini-muffin pans, three regular muffin pans and a miniature bundt cake pan I have no recollection of buying.  It has never been used.  What in the world is wrong with me.However, hoarding tendencies -- if well, organized and stored neatly -- do come in handy once in a while.  The Bean needs a shepherd's headdress for Thursday.  She doesn't want to be a shepherd but that is another story.  Well, since I am the only person who sews those sorts of duties fall to me and I was stressing a bit since I don't live across the street from Joann Fabrics anymore and all my stuff is packed up in big boxes.So, I did what everybody does and went to pinterest and noticed a lot of these sorts of costumes are made with towels or just rough cut fabric so I got to thinking.  I like to embroidery cup towels -- the old fashioned muslin sort and I knew I had a package of them.  Someplace.  So, I limped up the stairs, went to the box labeled \"needlework\" and started rummaging through all the cross stitch fabric and voila! There it was.  A brand new package of muslin cup towels just ready to be transformed into a shepherd headdress.  How will I do that?  Open the package, take it out, place on child's head and tie it on with a random piece of fabric.Boom.Hoarding isn't necessarily a bad thing."},

Books don't have the same value they used to -- and they are so easy to hoard.Arrange your home in some sort of logical manner -- like things with like things -- putting things where you are going to use them.  If you don't have room and have the urge to stick your children's baby photos in with the cup towels step back and re-think.  If you don't have enough room maybe you should get rid of something .If you arrange your home logically then the movers can pack up for you.  If you don't then you run the risk of them whispering behind your back \"what is this broad thinking\" or \"OMG, why does she have this here\".  I am sure they don't do that but that is a real fear.Ok, time to go take the cover off the bed and throw it into the back of the car.  Day 1 went well with the movers and I am sure day 2 will go equally smoothly.  The rest is up to us and I am sure it is going to take days and days and probably not go nearly as smoothly.  I will let you know.Let the moving commence."},

While it seems that this was a quick decision and things have moved along at a rapid pace it also seems like it is taking forever.  I think I am the one taking forever.Once we took possession of the house, and the previous owner's stuff was out, we finally got a good look at some things that really needed to be done.  The glaring issue was carpeting in the living room.  I would have to say that somebody had an issue with red wine on a beige carpet.  There was also a red wine issue with a lamp shade on the light fixture above the breakfast table.  I am not sure if I want to know about that.....So, we swapped out the shades on the light fixture and headed to the locally owned flooring store around the corner from the new abode.We were just going to have the carpet switched out but on further review opted to do a bit more.  The very back bedroom will become our study complete with a rolling desk chair so we decided to put some solid flooring in there rather than carpeting although there isn't anything wrong with the carpet that is in there.  We also chose to remove the carpet from the hallway and continue the solid flooring through there just for a good transition.  We chose a product called Core-tec -- one of these new modern engineered things that is rapidly replacing laminate.  It is 100% kidproof, waterproof, and pet proof.  And since we don't have too many red-wine issues here I assume it will hold up well. We have also opted to remove the wood flooring from the entry and dining room and put this Core-tec flooring there as well.  The wood needed to be replaced and we were keen to do it all at once. So, here is that product --not my house!Since we are currently living with real travertine floors I think this will be a good transition for us and much easier on my knees as one of the layers is cork.  I feel that twelve years on stone floors has gone a long way to make my knees much worse than they really need to be so I am hoping this will help.In the living room we thought about going with the same stuff but I really wanted carpet -- again for the legs/knees.  I don't especially like carpet because it is just one big dust ball as far as I am concerned but I do like the coziness of it.  We chose  a Mohawk product called SmartStrand which I was told was one of the lowest VOC products available.  I am all about that, you know.  I would show you a sample but I can't find it on the website and I can't remember the pattern name.  It is a low nap carpet and the color is Antique Light so you can have some idea of what it is -- it blends very well with the Core-tec. Installation of the floors begins tomorrow and will be done by next Tuesday for sure.  The products are having to come from Georgia but they are due here today and I am ready for work to commence.I am trying to pack but packing all the wrong things!  I need to be emptying out the furniture but instead I am emptying out the cabinets!  I need to regroup.  That is what I will be doing today as we are carrying a lot of our breakables ourselves and it is taking a lot of trips even though we have a truck.  I think we have too many breakables! I think we have too much stuff, period!And, I have lost the charger for my Kindle.  Blah.  I am sure I will lose a number of things -- hopefully not my mind.So, that is my quick update on the transition from Maison Brinkley to Brinkley Cottage.  More later.  Oh yes, tomorrow we get internet at Brinkley Cottage as well!  Yay!  Life will feel much more normal!More soon."},

My parents were married on the 14th in 1942, my in-laws were married on the 13th in 1942, my mother in law was born on the 18th in 1921, my daughter in law was born on the 28 in 1977 and my youngest granddaughter was born on the 17th three years ago.  Lots of celebrations and yesterday was no different.We started the day with a party at my son and daughter in laws house for the three year old, Emily.  She had a Care Bear cake and received a lot of presents.  We got her a nap mat and a tent all in the ever popular \"zebra\" pattern.  Black and white goes with everything, doesn't it?After that party I came home and took a much needed nap to rest my knee and my mind.  Too much going on right now.  After that we went to a local barbecue place called Cousins to celebrate my mother in law's 96th birthday.  All of her four children and their spouses were there.  Out of her eleven grandchildren, six were there -- four with spouses and all 13 of her great-grandchildren were there.  It was a large group and the majority of it was running crazy playing tag and hide and seek.  It was a bit rowdy but I rooted myself in the back corner where I could stretch out my knee and just observe.And what did I observe?  Well, one lost a colored pencil in the groove in the floor, one was running crazy and ran smack into the wall, the rest of them decided that crawling around on the floor under the tables was a fun thing to do wallowing in all manner of yuck under there.  And, Bean decided to share her science experiment, a lava lamp, with all who would observe.  Very lively group.  The rest of us were complaining about aches and pains and my niece was giving helpful information about my knee.It was a long day but since I spent the majority of it sitting I didn't get too tired but tired enough that I hit the sack the minute I got home.My daughter did share these photos  from this year and the past couple of years so I thought I would share them here.  I have to wonder what these girls are eating or drinking that is preserving them so well -- I see very little change in any of them.  I wish I had known their secret about thirty years ago.Jan Brianna Jill -- 2015Jan Brianna Jill 2016Jan Brianna Jill 2017There are three more girls -- Sarah, Rachel and Rebecca but they were unable to be with us.  Love them all!"},
{"title": "That Was Then and This is Now -- Comparing Apples to Oranges", "date": "Thursday, November 16, 2017", "text": "Picture this -- 1973 -- San Antonio, Texas.  Factor in two young people with zero experience in house buying.  Sounds like a disaster waiting to happen, right? Not so much. When we married in July, 1972 we moved to a really cute little apartment with a sunken living room, a miniscule galley kitchen, a nice sized bedroom and several really decent closets.  Apartment living wasn't really great for my husband, however.  I came home one day to find the closet housing all my wedding gifts emptied, everything piled up in the corner of the dining area and a work bench had been constructed in the closet. I knew my apartment days were numbered.So, close to the end of that first years lease, my mother spotted a house in a little local, neighborhood paper -- the Northside Recorder -- and suggested we look at it. We did.It had a living room/dining room combo, a big eat-in kitchen, three bedrooms and one bathroom. It had new carpeting (gold) and new draw drapes (also gold).  It was enormous in our eyes.  It was close to our families.  And -- it had a garage. So, we started negotiation if that is what you want to call it.  The family that lived there at the time had only been there for six months.  The husband was military and they were in and out in a blink of an eye. Here were the terms and conditions -- $1800 down and assume a 30 year VA loan that still had 29 1/2 years on it.  We sat on the living room floor with a piece of notebook paper and wrote a contract that we (Hubs and I) would bring her $1800 by a certain time on a certain date, we would assume the loan and a week later we moved in.Fast forward to now ---Not. So. Easy.  We have loans and papers and warranty policies and inspections and on and on and on.  While moving to this new house was sort of a quick decision, getting there is slow and painful.  So much to do, so many people to talk to, so many papers to sign (did I just sell my first born?).  Just so much.I won't be doing this again.I promise.All I want to do is move.And, my knee hurts again -- seems I moved too much yesterday.Sigh"},
{"title": "Moving Right Along -- Literally", "date": "Saturday, November 11, 2017", "text": "Movement -- that seems to be the focus of my life these days. For the last three weeks I have had very little movement, choosing to sit curled up in a chair writhing in pain.  I finally moved myself to the doctor, got x-rays and a referral to an orthopedic surgeon.  The conclusion is that I have severe arthritis in both knees and I was having a lot of inflammation in my right knee so action had to be taken.I didn't know this doctor but she put my mind at ease and was easy and pleasant to converse with.  She drew a lot of fluid off the knee (I could feel a difference immediately) and then administered a cortisone shot.  She then prescribed Aleve twice a day for two weeks which I am a little cautious about but I am following orders as laid out.  I am doing a few exercises to try to improve my range of motion in that knee because after sitting curled up for three weeks I am almost unable to straighten my leg which makes walking pretty difficult.  I am seeing some improvement and am SO grateful because more movement is in my future.We have decided to move from our current home to a new-to-us house with some much needed changes.  We moved here about 12 years ago -- new construction, a garden home with the yard done for us, in a small gated community.  It has been nice but it lacks some things we need.When we moved here we didn't have four grandchildren.  Our house has two bedrooms and a study.  When I have the group over and need to put them down to sleep I have no room.  It also has a larger garage for my woodworker husband and a place for me to sew which is a plus.  It is also in closer proximity to both our children which will be nice.  We will close on the property on the 20th and I am ready to get this show on the road.  We (that means the Hubs) have started packing and will continue today.  I don't look forward to this part of it but will be glad when we get it accomplished.  I am ready to be settled.  The fact that we are moving into the bad weather season hasn't escaped me so I am ready to get my stuff in the new place just in case we do something silly like winter.So, that is what has been going here.  I will update as time goes on and hopefully we won't run into too many glitches!"},
{"title": "Just Checking In", "date": "Saturday, October 28, 2017", "text": "I have been away from here for a bit but things have been a little hectic around here. The first thing I have done something horrible to my knee.  I think it is an arthritis flare but it might be bursitis.  One thing it is for sure is miserable. I went to the doctor yesterday for it and he is sending me for x-rays to see which of my knees is the worst and told me to quit taking Advil.  I asked what I should do about the pain which has been very bad (I have a high pain threshold and this has literally brought me to my knees.).  He suggested that I use a Salonpas patch since it has lidocaine but since I am allergic to adhesives I passed on that. So, I tried Aspercreme with Lidocaine this morning and it actually helped.  I was surprised and relieved.  I have only used it once today and I am still experiencing a manageable amount of pain. However, now I feel like I am coming down with a bug.  I can't be less thrilled.  I had two dr. appointments yesterday and was spiking a low temp at each so I don't know if I really feel bad or if it is just in my head but I feel cold and clammy and my tummy is a tad dodgy. All of this complicates our latest project.  We are considering a move to another house. We are working on it and I will say it is a much more complicated process once you are retired.  We aren't completely sure we are going to go through with it but we are forging ahead with a positive attitude. We celebrated my eldest granddaughter's 9th birthday today. It was a nice gathering and she is growing up way to fast.  The four cousins were together and it was a good time had by all.Our weather has changed and our 20 minutes of autumn has passed and winter is upon us -- until Monday when summer returns. No wonder everybody feels bad. Yck.  I don't like season changes and then next weekend --I think-- we have to face the time change.  Hopefully they will stop that -- I heard talk about it and hope they carry through with it.So, I thought I would check in with what is going on -- not much yet a whole lot all at the same time and we are at the point where we hurry up and wait.More on the move later."},
{"title": "You Are Never Too Old To Learn -- Sort Of", "date": "Friday, October 06, 2017", "text": "I have been embarking on a new idea to eat better.  It is called intuitive eating.  The general premise is to only eat when you are hungry and stop eating when you are comfortable -- not full.  It sounds easy, right?  Actually, it is once you learn your hunger cues.  In order to do that you have to let yourself get hungry so you know what it actually feels like.  Then, if you need to, eat until you are full -- you know, Thanksgiving-I-can't-believe-I-ate-that-whole-turkey full.  Then you know what \"full\" is.  You only have to do it once.  Then, you know your goal is pretty much the halfway point between ravenous and #OMGIAMGOINGTOEXPLODE!There are a couple of visuals out there to help as well.  One is a graph that shows hunger on a scale of 1-10 -- you are aiming for 5.  Once  you realize all these feelings, that isn't hard to do.  The second is visualizing that your stomach is about the size of your clenched fist.  It only takes that same amount of food (a fist sized clump of mashed potatoes) to get you from 0 to 5.I would also suggest following the old \"manners\" guideline of putting your fork down between bites and thoroughly chewing your food.  That way you give your brain a chance to tell your body that you are getting full.  If you use your fork like a shovel and approach food with your plate close to your face with your fork/shovel at the ready -- you are going to miss your cue.OK, I have been working on this for a couple of weeks and it has been really easy.  No dieting, a better relationship with food and I feel normal -- not always trying to figure it out.Enter -- exercise.  I need to exercise and I really think walking is the best thing for me.  I really do.  As long as nothing is in my way it is the one thing I can do without hurting myself.I should not do squats.  Over thirty years ago I started on my journey to arthritis by doing squats -- with weights -- badly.  Totally whacked out my knees.  So, why then, do you supposed I would think that doing squats in my dotage would be a good idea?  I think I was feeling so empowered by the eating thing that I was totally undaunted by the idea of the squats.I was humbled -- actually, brought to my knees -- literally.  I couldn't do them safely and effectively 30 years ago and nothing has improved since then.  I whacked out my knee again.  I have been hobbling around in pretty significant pain for about a week.  Yes, I should have gone to the doctor or maybe a chiropractor but I chose to sit here and cuss and cry because we all know how effective that is.I really felt like something was \"stuck\" or out of place so I decided I had a dislocated knee.  I googled it because that works well.  It didn't appear to fit the criteria so I sat with an ice bag on my knee all day, rubbed it with Salonpas which stinks to high heaven and took extra-strength Tylenol -- aspirin and Advil did nothing.  I hadn't slept in days because I couldn't get comfortable.So, last night I went to bed with my poor knee propped up on a pillow -- that lasted about three seconds -- so uncomfortable -- but I finally got in a decent position and went to sleep.  Sometime in the middle of the night I tried to turn over, something in my knee popped, I screamed -- hubs asked me if I was alright.  Say what?  I am just dandy -- I just always scream out in excrutiating pain in the middle of the night.  Don't mind me.So, what did I do?  I turned over, went back to sleep and slept the rest of the night.This morning I am actually able to sit in this chair and move my knee around.  It is plenty sore and I can see an ice bag in my future but it feels different and I think something was shifted out of place.So, what did I learn?  Squats aren't my friend!  Quit trying to do them.  Go back to walking and be happy to be what you are and quit trying to be something you aren't (19 year old thin to be exact).However, there is something else and I feel I really must share this.  A year or so ago I bought a pair of Tieks.  In taupe.  They aren't my friend either even though I love them dearly.  I can't walk in them.  Every time I wear them I get cramps in my feet, my ankles get really sharp pains in them and I am pretty sure they have been contributory to the knee problem as I have absolutely no support in them.  Yesterday I put on a pair of SAS loafers and I could feel a difference in my knee -- before the popping.  I guess I have just moved into the realm of orthopedic shoes.   So, sad.  How did I get this old and crippy.I don't know but I guess I will just continue to be content with my intuitive eating and walking for exercise.  Our weather is supposed to change sometime next week so maybe I can go outside and walk if the knee has gotten better since then.So, yeah -- that is what is going on here at Casa de Brinkley."},

{"title": "Smoothies, Books and DAR", "date": "Friday, September 22, 2017", "text": "I have been a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) for a number of years.  I used to go regularly as the meetings are held at my church and they were in the morning so it all worked out well.  I was even the recording secretary for two years.  There were a dozen or so of us that met and it was a very rich and rewarding time.Then Bean arrived and I began my time as a child care support person.  That eliminated the morning meetings for me.  I could have taken her but it is quite the distance from her house to church and I wasn't comfortable with it.  So, I gladly gave up the monthly meetings to care of the Bean.  Then Bean started school and I thought \"oh, I can attend the morning meetings and still be done in time to get her from school\".  Hmm.....they changed them to evening meetings timed right while I was driving home.  So, I haven't made much effort to get there.Last night, however, a friend of mine from church was being installed and she asked that a number of us who are church/DAR members be there so I high tailed it back to this side of town to get there in time for her installation.  I made it, she got installed, and I realized that I actually missed those meetings.In the seven years that I have been away, the member ship has grown from just a few to 134!  I don't know how many were there last night but Mitchell Hall was full to the rafters.  It was a much younger group than I remember and very lively.The program was all about All Church Home -- a FW organization that started out as an orphanage and has become more of a foster care organization.  They do a lot of good work and it is something to be supported.  We also learned of a preservation project that one of our ladies has undertaken.  There is a small, hidden cemetery right around the corner from my house.  My husband discovered it one day and we have been watching it.  The property around it is being cleared for -- wait for it -- a parking lot.  (Sounds like a 60's song!) Apparently our DAR lady got involved, I assume because she feared it might be paved over, which it might have been, and has now saved the cemetery from destruction. We are going to be involved in a project to revitalize the area, cleaning up, doing some painting and planting.  My husband and I were trying to find out the name of the cemetery -- it seems it is Thompson Public Cemetery and quite a few members of the founding families of White Settlement, Texas are buried in this cemetery.  It is quite old, the most recent burial around 1949, and it is comprised of a couple of large families.  It is quite interesting and I will post some photos when my husband and I go poking around some Saturday morning.I have decided I don't like breakfast.  When I was a youngster it was all my mother could do to get me to eat a piece of toast for breakfast.  Toast and tea -- true to my UK roots.  Then, when my kiddos came along I decided I needed to be a good example since breakfast is supposed to be the most important meal of the day.  Well, I started eating breakfast and I started gaining weight.  I have been reading \"Thin Within\" and realized that I am not hungry in the morning when I first get up but I eat anyway.  That is not good.  Even when I get hungry I am not ravenous and we eat our big meal at lunch so I don't want to eat a huge breakfast just to not be hungry at lunch.  So, I decided to revisit smoothies.  This morning I had one with yogurt, a little milk, frozen cherries, flax seed, wheat germ, a little cinnamon and some vanilla.  It was lovely.  I was up about an hour and it was just enough to satisfy what little appetite I had.  I think it will carry me through until lunch.I have been reading a lot lately.  I just started another Agatha Raisin mystery and I just purchased the new Jan Karon offering the other night.  The Agatha Raisin title is \"The Day the Floods Came\" and the new Jan Karon book is \"To Be Where You Are\".  I borrowed the Agatha Raisin title from the public library on my kindle so I will be finishing it before I start Karon's novel but I own it and can take my time.  I think it is so clever how we can check out library books on a device.  It makes it so easy and you have them the same time as if you went into the library and checked out the physical book.  AND....you don't have to make the effort to return them.  They just automatically expire -- no rushing to the library to return, no late fees -- it is really nice.So, that is what I have been up to this week.  I have no idea what the weekend holds -- we shall see."},
{"title": "The Fifth Petal and Anne Frank", "date": "Saturday, September 16, 2017", "text": "I have just finished reading \"The Fifth Petal\" by Brunonia Barry.  It is the sequel to \"The Lace Reader\" and it was equally as good.  It is the story of Rose Whelan, the Goddesses, and Callie.  And Salem.  It is a great ghost story, a murder mystery and a romance.  I should have waited until October and cooler weather, however, to read it.  It is a perfect fall read -- but it isn't ever going to be fall in Texas so I decided to go ahead and read it.I recommend.Now I am reading \"The Diary of a Young Girl: The Definitive Edition\".  I read the Diary of Anne Frank years and years ago so I decided to revisit this new, expanded edition.  It is a lot different than I remembered.  Maybe I should go back and reread the one I read originally.  There seems to be a lot of added material that was omitted from the original edition.  It is good, it seems more realistic.  It seems to be a fast read.I will let you know.Have you ever thought that doing things the \"old school\" way was better?  Easier?  We have so many labor saving devices and computer apps to help us do things that one wouldn't think doing thing the old fashioned way would be acceptable anymore or even desirable. However....I have one of these --Only mine is red and her name is Ruby.  I love Ruby, we get along very well and she is holding up well for her age.  The problem is, I don't like pushing and pulling Ruby around.  She is a little on the, um, portly side for her size and it is exhausting getting her go where I want her to go.  I love her, though, and would never get rid of her.However -- I also have this --Meet Big Wooly  -- Big Wooly is an American made dust mop with a washable, all wool head and a lacquered handle.  It has a 12 inch swivel action head that makes it very easy to maneuver around furniture. Since most of my floor are solid surface either option works but shhh....don't tell Ruby ....but Big Wooly and I have a better working relationship.Then, my next big booger bear is dusting.  Since my house has every window covered in plantation shutters I have a lot of dusting to do.Sometimes I use this --or thisor just a microfiber cloth.However, the other day on my soap opera (hey, they CAN be educational!) I was watching somebody dusting with an ostrich feather duster.  So, I did a little research and learned a lot.  I have had lambswool dusters and chicken feather dusters and I didn't care for them but I have never had an ostrich feather duster.  Apparently they are completely different. So, I took my sassy self to BedBathandBeyond and bought this --Considering the price of the Swiffer duster refills, $12.99 isn't bad for this little jewel.I got up yesterday morning and dusted all the furniture in my living room and my den and I dust mopped all the floors.  I couldn't believe how quick and easy it was.  The dust mop makes the floors really shine and the feather duster really did pick up the dust -- my mother always said they just throw the dust around but -- sorry Mom, you were wrong on this one.I have been reading a couple of blogs that promote doing things the \"old school\" way and generally living a more simple existence. They take me back to my childhood sometimes so when  I pulled out that dust mop  I could see my mother cleaning house -- she loved dust mops -- in her white shorts and rubber flip flops.  She wasn't big on lots of appliances -- give her a broom, a dust mop, a wet mop and some Lysol and she was good to go. And it all worked! The house is clean and I am not exhausted!  The moral of this blog is -- pay attention to your mom and your soap opera -- you can learn a lot from both!"},

{"title": "Prepping and the Weather", "date": "Friday, August 25, 2017", "text": "All our lives we have heard how the weather and the skies affect us.  More babies are born during a full moon because of the moon's affect on water -- all water.  Humidity messes with our hair and gives us headaches.  Cold weather causes us to want to hibernate and hot weather makes us sluggish.In the past several days two major weather events have messed with us -- our minds and our bodies.  The first was, of course, the eclipse.  We only had a partial showing here in Fort Worth but it felt strange and looked strange -- an unusual cast on everything outside.  Supposedly wildlife could behave differently but I didn't have any wildlife around to try to judge that.  It did get very quiet and still and there was just a creepy vibe.  I was actually glad when it was over even though I harbor no superstition about such events.The latest event is Hurricane Harvey churning around in the Gulf of Mexico threatening the Texas coast.  It has already caused mandatory evacuations and boosted the sales of plywood and duct tape.  My poor sister in law is having to move everything upstairs from a low level storage building and garage.  Fortunately they have one of those beachy houses up on stilts since they live right on the beach in Galveston.  I hope they are ok.Now, this weather isn't going to reach us, in any big way, here in North Texas.  However, from my years of living in South Texas, in San Antonio, and having experienced a number of hurricanes, my first instinct was to go to the grocery store and stock up. Back in the day when I had kids and cooked a lot, I always had a fully stocked pantry.  Now, as years have passed and it is just the two of us, we eat out more than we should and I shop less than I should.  However, I decided yesterday was the day to go recreate my pantry.  The problem is, however, that I used to buy lots of canned goods and now we eat more organically so I was a bit stuck on what I would buy -- fresh doesn't last long it seems.As I looked at my pitiful, existing pantry I realized that most of the canned goods I buy are organic, GMO-free, bpa free and there is generally a good variety.  So, I decided I could actually have my pantry of old with my new mindset.So off I went and I am feeling very comfortable with my stash.  I figured out a long time ago not to buy stuff that I don't really use so I stuck to what I know we will eat -- I only forgot a couple of things -- and this is the final result with the new and improved pantry.I should have wiped down the shelves but I haven't done that yet. working more toward getting stuff re-arranged.  I haven't tackled the bottom yet because that is where my husband-the-hoarder keeps every paper grocery bag that comes into this house.  I don't know what he is saving them for but he is diligent.  Grrr.So, anyway, I have managed to purge a lot of out of date things and I realize that I really need to visit my pantry more often.  My goal is to cook more and I am doing that and maybe now it will be more enjoyable with a more concise pantry.Thank you Mr. Hurricane Harvey."},

My niece is a podcaster and a contributor to Forbes Magazine.  She is a writer and has always been.  So, she started a podcast about writing.  It has been going for a good while now but I decided to listen to it today for the first time.  I am not done, I will pick it up later and finish but I am enjoying it.  If you are interested her name is Sarah Rhea Werner and her podcast is \"WriteNow\".This has been a very lazy morning.  I was able to sleep a little later today -- a blessing I am sure I received in celebration of all the walking I did yesterday.  Plus, we had a rainstorm which made sleeping in all the better.I have caught up on the laundry, thrown all the trash away and cleaned the kitchen.  So, now what time is it?Lunch time and reading time.Lunch will be at MiCocula's -- our go-to neighborhood, indi Tex-Mex restaurant. Reading?  \"The Fifth Petal\" by Brunonia Barry.  It is the sequel to \"The Lace Reader\" but it is scarier.  I should have waited until October to read it but that would have just been silly.So, it is hump day.  We have had a cold front (hahaha!) come through which will keep our temps below 90.  We had a lot of rain and are expecting more from the disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico.  I doubt I will stock up on duct tape because it isn't supposed to advance this far north but I might have to stock up on toilet paper and milk just because that is what we always did when \"the 'cane was coming\" -- words from my three year old son.Have a wonderful Wednesday and do whatever you love!"},
{"title": "Starting Over -- Again!", "date": "Tuesday, August 22, 2017", "text": "For some reason it is impossible for me to stay on an even keel.  Whether it is cleaning my house, doing my laundry, trying to maintain a reasonable eating routine, I am generally all over the place -- a hot mess.I was doing really, really well with all of it until I wasn't.  I don't know what turned the tide but in the blink of an eye I was all adrift again -- with five extra pounds on me. So, I went out yesterday and bought a Fitbit Charge 2 in teal. I bought it because my friend Gill has one and she earns cute little badges and, because I like cute little badges, I wanted one as well.  This tracker has more to offer than my garmin vivofit in that it doesn't fall off my wrist in unfortunate places like the parking lot at the grocery store.  It also has cute little badges.I have signed up for a fitbit challenge -- Goal Day.  My goal is 8000 steps. Ha! This should be good.  We will see if I can meet the challenge -- even remotely.  I will let you know.So, today I start over.  Again.On the literary front, I am reading \"The Fifth Petal\" by Brunonia Barry.   She is the author of \"The Lace Reader\" which I really enjoyed and another title I didn't read, and can't recall, because it didn't get a good review from my own personal book reviewer.  So far it is really good but making me long for October, my favorite month of the year. I think I should still be reading beach novels because it is still very much summer here.  However, I am into this one and will continue.  I have the hard copy but had to buy the Kindle version of it because the book is so large it is hard to hold and I wasn't enjoying the hassle.  Much easier on the device.Television watching has certainly changed for us, especially during the summer months when everything has gone on hiatus.  We are watching Acorn and Britbox almost exclusively.  We have finished these series -- \"Doc Martin\", \"Poirot\", one of the versions of \"Miss Marple\", \"George Gently\", \"Mum\" and we are now working on \"William and Mary\".  Now, these are entire series -- not just a show here and there so you can see why I need the fitbit and the challenge -- too much sitting, too many cookies -- yes, you can have too much of a good thing and then you can wind up with too much of you.Have been doing some reading on fashion for old women.  That is a blog post in and of itself. So, I am off to do Tuesday and walk 8000 steps on a gimpy knee.  No use waiting for it to get better -- it hasn't gotten better since I was 34 and diagnosed with arthritis.  Hopefully the walking will help.  Guess I will be dragging out the gazelle glider because walking around my kitchen island is about as boring as watching paint dry.I will report in."},
{"title": "The End of Summer for All Intents and Purposes....", "date": "Tuesday, August 15, 2017", "text": "It is mid-August and summer is drawing to a close for all intents and purposes.  My grandchildren are back in school, my daughter is back at work, the weather seems to be a bit changed although that is really just a \"feeling\" (still triple digits here) and people on the innerwebs are talking about Christmas.  Yikes!There has been a lot of stuff going on here at Maison Brinkley, mostly  pulling together loose ends and trying to go into the fall season with some idea of accomplishment.  There has been some thought given to how I want to spend my time and what I want to be doing.  There is one thing that I was determined to accomplish this summer.  My parents passed on a LONG time ago -- my mother in 1996 and my dad in 2000.  When my mother left us my father couldn't travel back to our hometown to bury her.  So, the plan was to cremate and we would hold on to her until my father passed and then we would commit them together.  That is what we did except for one small thing -- it took me until August 4, 2017 to actually see the plan to fruition.  Now, before you decide that I was just lazy or uncaring let me explain.  They had bought burial property in 1957 in San Antonio but my mother always disliked it.  My father always wanted to be buried in the family cemetery in Harper, Tx -- the one you have to use dynamite to dig a grave. Our other option was a military cemetery since my dad was a WW2 vet.  My cousin, a pastor, was supposed to do the honors but unfortunately he was killed in a car accident about six years ago. I was very conflicted over choices -- none of them felt right -- enough so that I got stopped every time I tried to move forward. After our brief vacation to San Antonio, I had sort of decided to place them in the military cemetery in San Antonio but I couldn't get the military to answer the phone.  As I sat and waited for the military it occurred to me what my problem was.  I am an only child.  I lived all my life around my parents, they even moved to Ft.W to be with me and the kids.  I couldn't imagine burying them somewhere away from me and I will never move back to San Antonio.  So, when that light bulb came on I immediately made a call to the local, large, heavily wooded cemetery that is just down the road from my house.  Appointments were made, plans set, our dear rector agreed to do the religious honors and before I knew it, it was done.  We chose a spot in the curve of a clump of oak trees with a lovely shaded canopy.  It is in a new section so it is still being developed and it is still a little new looking but it won't stay that way for long.  The spot is at the top of a small hill with a sweeping view of the rest of the cemetery, looking one way, and town looking the other.  It is green and lush and the most peaceful place I have ever seen.  It was a private burial with just immediate family present.  It was perfect, it was just what they would have wanted.I was surprised to discover that even though it took me seventeen years to bury my parents the feelings were the same as if it had just happened.  I didn't expect that. Entrance to Greenwood Cemetery, Fort Worth, TexasSo, that took up some of July and August.  There was a lot of soul searching, it was gut wrenching, there were no tears, however, but great relief at finally paying my parents the respect they deserve.  We decided to also make all those decisions in regards to ourselves for our children -- everything bought, paid for and planned out.  We will be buried in the same plot as my parents, the headstone will already be there and all they will have to do is make the call. Part of the reason I had so much trouble is because my parents were not sure what they wanted even though they had purchased property.  I spent all this time trying to get into their heads.  When I finally came to the conclusion I did, I knew it was the correct decision because peace just washed over me.On that note, I intend to move forward into the autumn of the year with my sights set on new interests, bringing back old interests and trying to be a better me."},

{"title": "Saturday 9", "date": "Sunday, July 30, 2017", "text": "Ok, I have done this once or twice but can't remember to do it so I missed doing it yesterday.  So I am doing it today.  Don't judge me -- I seem to be permanently off schedule.  If you want to jump in just go to the site and follow the instructions.  So, here I go.Welcome to Saturday: 9. What we've committed to our readers is that we will post 9 questions every Saturday. Sometimes the post will have a theme, and at other times the questions will be totally unrelated. Those weeks we do \"random questions,\" so-to-speak. We encourage you to visit other participants posts and leave a comment. Because we don't have any rules, it is your choice. We hate rules. We love memes, however, and here is today's meme!Unfamiliar with this week's tune? Hear it here.1) Sarah McLachlan wrote this song about someone she barely knew. She read the obit of Jonathan Melvoin, keyboard player for the Smashing Pumpkins, who died of a heroin overdose. What's the most recent news story that touched you deeply? I try very hard not to watch the news because it ALL touches me.2) Ms. McLachlan performed this in tribute to Linda McCartney at the 1999 Concert for Linda. She was expressing her hope that, in death, Linda found relief and peace after a long and painful battle with cancer. What do you think happens to us when we die? I believe only our physical body dies and our soul goes to meet our maker and come to terms with our earthly lives.3) Daytime dramas General Hospital and As the World Turns used this song on-air after a major character died. Do you follow any \"soap operas?\" I watch Days of Our Lives and have done so since 1975  4) In 2007, Sarah donated her recording of this song to the ASPCA. Do you have a pet? If yes, how did you get it (shelter, pet store, etc.)? I don't currently have a pet but I did have, for 14 years, the privilege of being furmommy to Tessie, a wheaten Cairn terrier -- the best dog on the planet and I got her from a family that owned her mommy and daddy -- they weren't breeders, just a family with a couple of dogs that had puppies.5) She admits she can't watch those ASPCA commercials, where her recording of \"Angel\" plays over sad photos of animals. Is there a TV commercial that really gets to you (in either a good or a bad way)?  I feel the same way about those animal commercials that she speaks of.  Can't watch.  Or the commercials for St.Judes although that is one of my charities of choice.6) In 1994, Sarah was stalked by an obsessed fan. Tell us about a time you were really frightened. In retrospect, was your fear commensurate with the threat? I have never been threatened and never really felt fearful.  I am lucky.7) Sarah was adopted by Jack and Dorice McLachlan. Though she has a friendly relationship with her birth mother, she always considered Dorice her mother and sees herself behaving with her son the way Dorice did with her. Is there anyone in your family that you feel you resemble, either physically or by behavior? Haha!  ALL of them -- I am multi-faceted!  I see aspects of many of my relatives in me.  I am not turning into JUST my mother.8) McLachlan is one of the founders of Lilith Fair, a summer concert series designed to showcase talented female performers. Do/did your summer plans include an outdoor concert? No, no concerts.  It is too hot and mosquito ridden to go outside here.9) Random question: Which of these men would you most like to be seated with at dinner -- Clint Eastwood, Prince William or Jimmy Fallon?  The Prince, thank you very much!"},
{"title": "Pillows,Pillows Everywhere", "date": "Thursday, July 27, 2017", "text": "Let me start by saying that Hubby doesn't care for home decor that serves no purpose.  What comes immediately to mind is throw/toss pillows.  He also thinks that every flat surface is a work surface.  It could be an Ikea table or an antique dining room suite -- no difference.  Work Surface. Annoying. However, in spite of his opinions, we have never really had a lot of problem seeing eye to eye when furnishing a house.Until now.Going back in history -- when we were married in 1972  I inherited my bedroom suite that was lovely hard rock maple in the Early American design.  I had a dresser, chest of drawers, night stand and beautiful four poster canopy bed sans canopy.  This was our beginning.When we went to purchase furniture for our first apartment we carried the theme through and bought a BUNCH of Tell City Early American furniture.  It is well built furniture and we still have it and we use most of it. However, something happened along the way.  Oh, I know what it was == they quit making Early American furniture as it fell from favor.  I was grossly out of style but hey, this furniture wasn't going to fall apart anytime soon.  So, we tried to incorporate different styles over the years  but we either found new homes for those items or went back to buying pieces that, while not technically Early America, did blend well.  Maple was a thing of the past but cherry was quite popular so we have a good deal of that.Fast forward to the move to our current home.  The space here is different than our old house.  Fewer rooms but larger spaces which meant that our little drop leaf maple table was dwarfed in our breakfast/dining area.  So, off we go to the Amish furniture store to choose a new table.  It is large, it is cherry, it is lovely but it is dark.  We bought a sideboard to complement - black -- black tends to be a good transitional finish between older and newer furniture and styles. We also bought some new furniture from the Amish store -- a sofa and two chairs -- don't ever buy anything you sit on without being able to sit on it.  The chairs are fine, the sofa not so much.  It is cherry furniture with dark brown leather cushions.  Operative word -- brown-- dark brown.We also have two chairs that are brown Coach leather.  They are really pretty and lovely to sit in if  you want to watch tv on the ceiling or have no intention of speaking to the people on the other side of the coffee table because they recline very far back.  But, I am keeping them because  -- well, because. So, I have it all arranged in a \"pit\" sort of arrangement with a large coffee table in the middle with chairs and sofa surrounding it.  And what do you see?A sea of brown.Dark brown.So, my design sense is stuck somewhere in the 70's along with avocado green and harvest gold so I resorted to pinterest to see what to do about an all brown room.  I tried to get my husband to replace the uncomfortable couch but I got \"the look\" and just moved right along. So, after all of that explanation, here are some photos of what I did.unadorned chairs -- yes that is a crayon box on the table -- don't judge me -- I have grandchildrenI added two white throws as per Pinterest -- they are really nice, very reasoable, from Targetenter two stripey down pillows from Pier 1 -- they were having a nice sale -- still have to cut the tags offsofa with old ticking striped pillows -- I made them -- they are comfy to sleep onbringing in two brightly colored embroidered pillows from Pier 1 along with light beige throw from my cousin JLSHalladded two delightfully fun fuzzy pillows also from the Pier -- throw in a couple of pieces of mail that needs to be thrown out  So, tell me -- have I successfully diluted the brown?  My husband had to compromise-- throw pillows (on sale) or a new sofa (not on sale but doesn't matter -- way overpriced either way).  He was ok with the pillows as long as I don't put them on his chair.  After I do a bit of picking up and re-arranging I will take another photo from another angle and see what you think"},

So, I am thankful that everybody had fun, did what they wanted to do and did it all safely.  I am looking forward to seeing photos and hearing stories and am getting a little anxious for the first nip of autumn in the air -- but I have quite a wait for that.In the meantime ----"},

It was a very popular place as well.  It was ok but I think it could have been better. It was an interesting site though as there was also an RV park attached. Anyway, it was a lovely drive up Hwy.77, through the small towns from here to there, and I did take some photos so I thought I would share.Welcome to our Saturday!Wind turbines were everywhere and they were scary!

{"title": "The Pilgrimage", "date": "Sunday, July 16, 2017", "text": "Definition of pilgrimage             1 :  a journey of a pilgrim; especially  :  one to a shrine or a sacred place2 :  the course of life on earthOk, so maybe my recent \"pilgrimage\" wasn't as grand as this definition would have it but it is a trip we take every year around our anniversary.I speak of our annual trip \"home\" --to the city our births, the place where our youthful adventures were spent, the place we said we would never leave (until we did) -- San Antonio, Texas.When you say \"San Antonio\" the image that pops into most people's heads is the Alamo.  Rightfully so.  It is historic and there have been several movies made about it.  My favorite is the John Wayne version of my youth.  There is so much more to San Antonio, however, that most people don't really see or know of.San Antonio is old.  It began in 1718 by Fr. Antonio Olivares when he established Mission San Antonio de Valero which would later become the Alamo.  The Spanish explorers gave the San Antonio river its name because it was discovered on the feast of Saint Anthony of Padua, Italy.  At the time there was an Indian settlement in what is now called La Villita - the little village.  There was also a significant German influence in the building of the city but that goes largely unmentioned.  Some of the most influential families were of German descent and they began some of the biggest and longest running businesses -- Joske's Department Store and Pioneer Flour Mills (Guenther Family) come immediately to mind.Time has passed, the city has grown, city planners have decided to change things up and modernize, many of my childhood haunts have met their untimely demise under the wrecking ball in the name of progress -- many are now just vacant lots.  Makes perfect sense to me.  They have \"modernized\" our historic schools (tore them down) in the name of progress, they have taken downtown historic buildings and incorporated them into \"The Mall\" and stuccoed over ornate German built buildings again, to make it more modern.  Bleech. So, each and every year we make the trip home and peruse what has changed, what hasn't, what we remember, what we don't.  We are tourists in our own hometown.  This time was a bit different.  It was a longer trip and we weren't in a rush.  After two days, it seemed as if we had never moved.  It was a strange feeling.  In the past, when I have left to come home, my feelings have been mixed -- one time I will be homesick, other times I can't wait to leave.  This time was different -- my heart was waving and not saying goodbye but rather -- see you next year! I am truly living in two places and it feels ok. In the past we have visited the places of our childhood, our former homes and schools and this time was no different except that we included some different places that had meaning to us.  Or me, mostly.   So, I will share some of these photos with you to show you some of the beauty of this old city.San Antonio is a Catholic city.  It was founded as such and as such it remains.  Here are photos of two prominent Catholic churches in town.  The first is the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Little Flower.  My great-grandmother attended church here and was buried from here.The gentleman in the photo, I assume a caretaker, asked if he could comb his hair before I took the photo! He was very nice.  The next photos show St. Joseph's Catholic Church in the heart of downtown.  St. Joseph's was surrounded by a huge department store, Joske's of Texas, and at one point Joske's asked to buy the church for the property.  The offer was declined so they just built around the church and now the church is jokingly referred to as \"St. Joske's\".Magnificent, aren't they? Next are some photos of La Villita. La Villita was the actually beginning of the city, it was originally a small Indian community that the Spanish priests had come to convert.  In my youth, it was a pretty dicey place to roam around, it wasn't \"fixed up\", it was kind of scary actually.  However, over the years, probably around the time of the World's Fair in 1968, attention was paid to the salvation and preservation of this historic area and it now hosts a good number of high end restaurants and art galleries.  It is quiet and shady and just a magical place to visit.  Of course, it comes to life during Fiesta in April but on a daily basis it is just a pleasant place to visit.The Little Church of La VillitaThe next photos are just some random places downtown that have meaning to me.The Menger Hotel of Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Rider's fame.  However, I remember it being the place we would lunch with my Aunt Linnie who worked at Joske's and the place I got my leg stuck in the table leg, cried, got hauled to the bathroom to get my face washed and when I returned they had removed my ice cream.  Not a great memory.  We almost went there for dinner one night but I was afraid of the tables.I don't really know the name of this building but I believe it is the home of the Sol Wolfson store that my grandmother worked at when she was about 11.Schilo's -- the best deli in the world.  It has a very ornate bar.  We used to come here when I was a child and I would have recurring dreams about that bar -- I couldn't remember where it was until I walked in as an adult and there it was -- the location of my recurring dream.  Great food.  Really, really great food.The Tower of the Americas -- Hemisfair '68 -- I worked in the shadow of this very tall building at the San Antonio Independent School DistrictThe Transit Tower, or the Tower Life Building, where my father spent a good deal of his early radio career.The next photos are of the famed San Antonio Riverwalk.  When I was a child the Riverwalk was nowhere you wanted to be.  It wasn't a \"walk\" actually but a dirty creek than ran through town where all sorts of unsavory things could surface on a Sunday morning after a wild and woolly Saturday night.  However, again with the city planners, a decision was made to do something with the area which was a good thing -- it has been developed beautifully, is home to lots of restaurants and music venues, and it is a gorgeous, landscaped walk through downtown and they keep expanding it so it goes even farther now.  It isn't scary anymore.Looking out over Casa Rio Mexican RestaurantSwim little duckies -- we aren't sure about the yellow one in the flock of brown ones -- a swan maybe?WaterfallWhen I was a child growing up San Antonio had some really nice shopping downtown.  We didn't have malls and we didn't have cars so we had to take the bus downtown to shop.  We would walk up and down Commerce Street and Houston Street looking in all the little dress shops, shoe stores and dime stores.  I remember the way the Woolworth's smelled!  Ultimately we would end up at Joske's -- the biggest store in the biggest state (until we acquired Alaska!). Joske's was the Harrod's of the Southwest.  You could buy anything at Joske's.  There were two places to eat there -- The Chuckwagon which was where we went as children and The Camilla Room which we never went to because we were children.  There was a beauty salon and a bridal salon.  You could buy clothing, and fabric and shoes and saddles -- yes, indeed, you could get anything at Joske's.See -- you can see the church spire of St. Joseph's in it's little niche created by this giant department store.Well, Joske's survived well into my adulthood but then it went the way of so many stores being gobbled up by big conglomerates and it couldn't compete with the malls in the suburbs so it changed hands many times and finally just stood vacant for a number of years.  Another mall had been build downtown adjacent to Joske's and finally, in the last three years or so, Joske's was incorporated into that mall.  How you ask?  Well,they retained the complete facade and gutted the inside and subdivided it.  I wanted to see how that was done and if any remnants of the old building were there and I was pleasantly surprised.  Clearly the facade remains and it was cleaned up and refurbished.  It was a lovely building and they have done it justice.  The inside, of course, was different except that there were visual signs of the old store -- the windows were uncovered (I had never seen an open window in that store in all the years we went there) and looked out over the city.  The old, heavy brass doors remained with the hardware still in tact and there are huge wall sized photos of how the store was back in the day.  They look to be permanent and pay great homage to the store that was the biggest store in the biggest state.  I was afraid it was going to be a horror story but it wasn't and I would rather see it be part of the mall and saved than go under the wrecking ball like so many other things and places have.  It is good.Another place we visited was Woodlawn Lake.  Woodlawn Lake is situated in an area of town close to Jefferson High School -- a very historic, gorgeous high school -- and it is in the neighborhood that my mother spent her younger years in.  It is close to Little Flower and my mother's entire family lived in this area at one time or another.  We visited this area a while back and I have to say it was pretty sad.  It needed some work desperately and I would have to say that somebody took note of it and much progress has been made.  It is a lovely park now, Woodlawn Lake Park, and it is actually used.  I saw many people walking the walking paths, couples with ear buds walking to the music, moms with strollers, kids playing basketball and Egyptian geese all over the place -- google it -- odd birds with pink legs.  Anyway, this is one area that progress made sense and it looks good.If you click on this photo and make it bigger you can see lots of history here -- Little Flower, The Transit tower, the Tower of the America's and this little lighthouse smack in the middle of the lake that has been there all my life. So, that was just a brief overview of our 2017 Pilgrimage to San Antonio.  We did other things, of course, like eat at our favorite anniversary restaurant, Fujiya's, and barbecue at Bill Miller's and Mexican food at Jacala's and Teka Molino.  We drove around our old houses and schools and libraries.  My elementary school has been torn down and rebuilt.  I realize it was necessary for the education of the kiddies but the new school just doesn't have the same historic, vintage look to it and I don't think it ever will.  Standard issue modern architecture.  Nothing to write home about.  It was a good trip -- I am already starting the sightseeing list for next year!  See you then, SA!"},
{"title": "By Jove, I Think She's Got It!", "date": "Tuesday, July 04, 2017", "text": "Ok, peeps, the word on the street is that Moi is weight challenged and not in a good way.  I need to take 75 pounds of me and put it someplace else.  \"Just stop eating\" they say.  \"Move around more\"  they chide.  Not. That. Easy.I have been on a diet since I was about 14 years old.  Ever since my Bobbi Brooks skirts went from an 8 to a 10.  I was officially fat at that point and not fond of the concept.  Plus, I had long hair and split ends.  I was a hot mess.Solution?  The hair got cut into a cute little \"bubble\" style which I wish would come back INTO style because it really worked for me.  Now it is considered an \"old lady's\" haircut.  Blah.  I digress.  I bought a small little calorie counter at the grocery store and set about making things better.  I was crazy.  I wasn't fat.  At 20 I weighed 129 pounds.  I wasn't fat.  But my brain was -- Hahah! Crazy body image disorder.Fast forward through life, two kids, great stress, personal loss, illness, medications, etc. and here I am needing to do something with this 75 pounds. In my mind I can see this cute little blob of fat, on a skateboard, chained to me and I have to drag it everywhere I go.  It has eyes and a sneaky little grin.  It follows me everywhere, especially the fitting room.  It is so annoying.I am a champion calorie counter.  I don't even have to measure anymore, I can eyeball a half cup of anything.  I am not great at math but 3500 calories = 1 pound is ingrained in my brain.  Calories in/calories out was my mantra FOREVER.For whatever reason, it isn't working right now.I read a book called \"The Obesity Epidemic\" by Zoe Harcombe.  Well, I tried to read it, very technical and statistic laden, but the gist of it is that the calories in/calories out concept doesn't work.  Not all calories are the same.  3500 calories out does not necessarily mean one pound lost.  She talked about a low carb eating plan.I am a carboholic.  I never met a cookie I didn't like.  I broke my cookie addiction a few months ago and didn't understand why I didn't just melt away like the Wicked Witch of the West.  Hmmm......could it be because I just replaced the cookies with things like crackers and pretzels?  I wonder.  Sometimes I am so dense.So, because I can't do anything in moderation, I decided to go very low carb -- as is no carb.  The first day I ate no carbohydrate.  Felt great.  Second day, not feeling so great but did virtually the same.  I had lost three pounds (all water, I am sure, who am I kidding!) Day three I woke up and thought surely I was bound for glory.  I was shaking like I had the DT's.  I could barely hold my head up.  I was close to tears.  I had Carbo Flu.I have enough health \"issues\" that I don't need to complicate my life with that.  So, after I ate some cereal and sugar laden yogurt I headed off to church to pray my way out of it.  During coffee hour I had a conversation about it with a friend of mine who is pretty nutrition savvy because of her own health issues.  As we talked a lightbulb started to slowly flicker. Calories aren't equal.  You can't live without carbohydrate.  Balance.  All words bouncing around in my head.My friend suggested two things -- a look at the American Medical Associations suggestions on macronutrients in our diet and to look back at the dietary requirements when we were children in the 1950's and follow that.  I did both.  Note: I won't be going back to jello salads of my youth, however.The AMA has a list of how what percentage of each macronutrient is considered acceptable and balanced -- carbs (45-65), protein (10-35) and fat (29-35).  I decided that instead of counting calories I would keep track of my macronutrients and keep it within their guidelines.  I think I have figured out that 150 calories of cookies is not going to be the same as 150 calories of brocolli or 150 calories of steak.  It just isn't.  There is this thing called food value or nutrition going on and that is more important than calories.I know I sound incredibly stupid but blame it on my generation.  Growing up the idea was to eat less and move more if you want to lose weight.  It is called The General Principal. You have to cut down 3500 calories to lose one pound.  If you cut 500 calories a day at the end of the week you will be one pound lighter. There are a couple of reasons why it might not work -- if you cut down on food you also cut down on energy which makes moving around a little less probable and again, calories aren't equal.  You can cut out 3500 calories in cookies or you can cut out that much in real, whole food and depending on which you choose, you possibly could be cutting out necessary nutrients leaving you with just the fast sugar rush of the cookies and the eventual sugar crash which is oh so amusing.So, I fired up MyFitnessPal on my phone and started logging in my food paying attention to the percentage of macronutrients and keeping it within the AMA suggested amounts.  I am pleased to tell you that it hasn't been difficult at all to do this, makes more sense to me actually and I haven't gained back the initial 3 pound loss but have gone on to lose 1.5 pounds more.    And I haven't been shaky or feel like my blood sugar has tanked.  All of this since last Friday.  And a side note, my step count has doubled.  Does that mean I have more energy or just more laundry requiring me to walk back and forth to the washer?  It is something to think about.So, have I finally discovered the Holy Grail of weight loss for me?  Have I finally come upon an eating plan that will let me lose weight and keep it off.  Have I figured out a way to eat that is healthy that I can actually stay on?  I don't know.  I will let you know.  But, for now, I am celebrating my 4.5 weight loss like I have won the lottery!"},
{"title": "A Week --", "date": "Saturday, June 10, 2017", "text": "I can hardly believe that a week has passed since I was here last.  It has been a rather uneventful week -- and slow -- but I can handle slow since some of my facebook \"friends\" are already counting down to Christmas.  I don't really understand that but since I don't do it I guess it doesn't really matter.Anyway, I digress.  The week started out with me having a bit of minor surgery.  As many of you know I underwent chemotherapy treatment almost four years ago.  This treatment required me to have a port installed.  Well, I never really made friends with this port -- I didn't name it or anything -- I just put up with it.  It wasn't completely dreadful but it was never really comfortable either.  So, last doctor visit, The Man, Dr. H. asked if I was ready to lose it.  I said \"yes, please\" but I had a pang of guilt.  I shouldn't have been so callous toward the port -- after all, it did help to save my life -- but, well, I get sappy over strange things.  So, Monday was the day.  I was elated on one hand and slightly terrified on the other.  It wasn't done in a hospital setting but right there in the doctor's office.  I was sort of anticlimactic, actually.  Nothing to write home about.  However, because of my feelings of guilt toward the port -- I brought it home.  In a jar.  It looks brand new.  Like it could be recycled.  Sometimes I am so odd.So, anyway, I haven't experienced any ill effects from the removal except the reaction to the adhesives on the tape.  I discussed my reactions with Dr. H so he used something that I wouldn't react to.  And I didn't.  I was to remove the bandage after 48 hours.  I did.  However, I decided that I still needed to cover it so I had some gauze pads and paper tape -- good to go, right?  Wrong.  By the next morning I was reacting to the adhesive on the tape.  So, I used some old paper tape I had had for at least ten years.  Yep, still reacted so I took the whole mess off and decided to just let it go.  I am still itching and have little blistery places.  I am healing nicely and the whole area is just a little tender, not painful, but itchy.  I guess I should have followed his instructions and just uncovered it.  Next time I won't try to be so proactive.  I hope there isn't a next time.So, the rest of the week has been mostly just resting to heal and doing a bit of housework and laundry.  I have started back on my 6 week challenge with Jenn.  While I was resting I got to thinking about what my physical needs are and mostly I need help with my mobility.  I don't move around enough and then when I try to jump into an exercise routine I fail miserable.  So, that got me to thinking about a dance class I took in college.  It was half jazz and half pilates and stretching.  It was wonderful.  Painful but wonderful.  I remember how it transformed my body and how I felt so strong.  I remember the exercises pretty well so I decided to try to do that.  Keeping in mind to be careful of my arm I set out to recreate my college experience.  Of course, I couldn't do as many reps as I did then but I am hoping to work up to it.  I have to say that after doing this for a couple of days my ankles and feet are less painful and I think that this is what I should have been doing all along.  I surprised myself that I can actually bend over and touch the floor.  I didn't think I could do that.Yesterday I was hit with the worse case of boredom I have experienced in years and years.  I am usually not bored but yesterday nothing was interesting me.  So, I pulled out a small cross stitch project.  I made good progress on it and maybe have a renewed interest in the craft.  I used to do all manner of needlework but somewhere along the line the desire just left me but this was fun last night so maybe I can keep it going -- if I choose small enough projects.  I will post a photo of my finish when I...finish.Today is grocery shopping.  I don't really care for any of the grocery stores right around me so I have to travel a ways to go to the one I sort of like.  I don't like grocery shopping much at all but it gets me out of the house and it gives me a reason to walk so it is beneficial in that regard.  I don't understand why we don't have more grocery stores -- it almost seems like companies don't think we need groceries anymore.  By my daughter's house they are building grocery stores on almost every corner but not in my part of town.  It is really odd.  I know that people are able to order online these days but I don't think enough people are doing that to close down bricks and mortar stores.  I don't even think I want to start shopping online.  I would never leave my house!So, that is my week.  Not very interesting - trust me -- I know.  Maybe next week will be better."},

{"title": "The Start of Summer, Debbie Macomber and my 6 Weeks to Summer Challenge", "date": "Wednesday, May 31, 2017", "text": "Hi, there! Did you think I had disappeared?  Nah, I never REALLY disappear-- I might get lost once in a while but I am never truly gone.  So, where  have  I been you might ponder? Well, ponder no more -- I will share my incredibly mundane existence with you.The Hubs and I are babysitting this week.  We are at my daughter's house during the day through Friday while Mom is finishing up in her classroom.  Today was an especially good day because Bean decided the thing to do was to surprise her mother by cleaning the WHOLE house -- spotless-- and she did.  I did very little and it wasn't really the whole house but enough so that Mom was quite impressed.  She thought it was fun!  Yay!  Who am I to tell her that after about the first 35 years it gets really boring?  I will let her figure that out on her own. Then, I finished the first book in the Cedar Cover series by Debbie Macomber.  The title is \"16 Lighthouse Road\".  It was a great read.  Of course, I will have to start the second one now -- another series I am roped into -- but I think it will be ok.  I enjoyed this one even though I had seen the miniseries.  The odd thing is that when I first saw the books in the bookstore I wasn't interested.  When the miniseries aired originally, I wasn't interested.  Then I watched it on Netflix and it was really good and the books are really good so what do I know?  Don't listen to me except yes, they are a good read.My 6 Weeks to Summer challenge has gotten a bit derailed.  I sort of ruined myself on Saturday.  We went to the zoo.  It was the hottest day of the year so far.  The heat index was 103.  I wore Tieks and decided the thing to do was to carry the cooler.  Granted, it was nylon but fully packed it was like a bunch of bricks.  I walked from the car to the ticket counter and I was done -- and we weren't parked far away.  So, for the next four hours I was in severe pain with aching feet and knees, I was exhausted from carrying the cooler and I was annoyed that I was such a disaster.  So, Sunday I couldn't move or walk, I was in so much pain, Monday was a little better -- not quite so tired but still oh so sore.  Tuesday better and am just now feeling like I can actually stand on my feet.  Note to self -- next time I head to the zoo, everybody carries his/her own lunch or we eat at the cafe.  Done.So, yeah, summer has begun for us, the weather is warm and a bit stormy right now and I am looking forward to many days of reading and decluttering and getting back to my challenge but I am not up to exercising quite yet."},

{"title": "Bridging", "date": "Friday, May 19, 2017", "text": "This year I had the honor and privilege of helping my daughter with her Girl Scout Daisy troop.  This was their second year as daisies and a busy year it was! There were service projects like making dog toys for the Humane Society and collecting used eye glasses.  They learned new things like compassing while visiting a nature preserve. They studied their faith during Jubilee Year of Mercy. They laughed, they cried, they giggled, they ran, they turned cartwheels and tonight...They bridged. That means they completed their second year as Daisies and tonight they became full-fledged Brownies.  In order to do this certain criteria had to be met.  They had to have an older Brownie talk to them about what it would be like next year as they start their time as Brownies.  Then, in turn, they had to talk to a younger Daisy about some of the things they did during their time as Daisy.  For the most part, we could do any sort of ceremony we wanted -- it could be simple or elaborate, indoors or outdoors, short or lengthy -- but we had to have a physical bridge. So, here are our girls on their bridge.And, of course, there had to be cake.So, our girls are growing up -- they are Brownies now! One even told us that she thought she had grown as she walked over the bridge.  I wonder which one that was?"},

And, it was the blessing of our new playground and church community recreation area.We had a picnic.  The meat was provided by Fr. Estes and the rest of the chow was brought to us by Feastivities -- a catering company owned by one of our own.  It was delish!  The congregation provided the desserts and ohmygoodness, they were good.  I never heard of making banana pudding with Chessmen cookies -- so much better than vanilla wafers.So, I thought I would share some snaps of the big day.  Of course, there were none taken in church of confirmation but it was a beautiful event, trust me on that.  But, here are some of the festivities afterward!So, yeah, this is our new playground with some really gorgeous play equipment.  What isn't pictured is a lovely new basketball court.  This area will be used for our kids to play, for some Sunday School instruction and for congregational gatherings like this one.  It is beautiful, the folks who worked on it this whole last year have done a wonderful job and we are truly blessed!The Weekly Muse is posted, here, every Sunday, and invites you to participate by either (1) answering these questions, privately, in your journal, (2) answering the questions on your blog, and then coming back to link that post here in the comments at Life, Unleashed, or (3) leave your answers directly in a comment here, on that week’s post.

To defrost meat.To keep up with the housework.  We cleaned house on Saturday and it would be helpful to do a bit in between so I don't have it all to do next Saturday.To exercise.  I really need to exercise.  I would like to walk outside but we have an Ozone day today so I won't be doing that but I can walk inside.  I have the equipment and the need -- just not much motivation.So, there you go.  This wasn't the most exciting meme in the world but it gave me a little focus.  So, for your viewing pleasure ...."},
{"title": "Sunday Stealing", "date": "Sunday, May 14, 2017", "text": "Sunday Stealing: The Getting to Know You Questions1. What is your occupation right now? How long have you been there?  I am a homemaker.2. Favorite rock band. Ever.I don't know that I ever really had a favorite.  I used to love all of them in the 60's because I liked to dance and they were mostly danceabe.  I guess if I have to narrow it down I would say the Beatles but the Beach Boys were a close second.  3. What are you listening to right now?The only thing I am listening to right now is the aquarium run.4. Last person you spoke to on the phone. What was it about?I guess the last person I spoke to on the phone was my cousin Martha.  It was just a chat.5. How old are you today? Or make up a question. This one bites.I have reached the age where I feel wise.  I feel like I am turning into my grandmother.  I am now old enough to feel that I am justified in doing what I want, when I want, with whom I want and I don't need to answer to anybody.  Ok I am 67.6. What is your favorite sport to watch on TV?Not much of a sporty person.  I do like to watch some of the olympics and we do watch Texas A&M Football in the fall7. What is your favorite drink?  All I drink is water8. Have you ever dyed your hair? I tried when I was younger and started turning gray.  It turned green.  I had to choose between gray and green.  9. Favorite food?  I don't really have one.10. What is the last movie you watched?  No clue.  We don't really watch movies too much11. Favorite day of the year?  The logical choice would be Christmas but that is a lot of work.  I think as holidays go, Easter.  12. How do you vent anger?  I yell.  That is a vast improvement over throwing dishes like I used to.13. What was your favorite toy as a child?  I always preferred books but those aren't really toys.  Um....crayons and coloring books.14. Living arrangements? (Of course your pets count. Geez!)  I live in Maison Brinkley with the husband and a fish.15. What was the last thing that you cried about? yuck, I don't cry.16. Who is the friend you have had the longest?  I would have to say my husband or Joy Lynn.  Actually Joy Lynn has been around longer than my husband but she is a blood relative.  Oh, I don't know.17. What did you do last night?  Helped my granddaughter with a sewing project.  Then I watched Agatha Raisin.18. What are you most afraid of?  I am afraid of something happening to my children or grandchildren.  Things like kidnappings and plane crashes and car wrecks.  On the whole, though, I am not a scared sort of person.19. In how many areas of your country have you lived? What's your favorite? I have lived in Texas.  How boring.  I have however visited other places and I think, besides Texas, my favorite was Arkansas.20. What is your favorite flower? (Ugh. Quite the note to go out on. But hell, we steal the questions. I guess you get what you pay for.)  I don't have a favorite flower.  I always liked roses for corsages when going to high school dances so I guess I would have to say roses.  With that said, the begonia I got last night from my grandchildren is pretty nice too!"},
{"title": "So Over It", "date": "Wednesday, May 10, 2017", "text": "I sound like my daughter -- \"I am SO over it\"!  But, I am.  My allergy situation is beyond any help whatsoever.  I am fed up with sitting here feeling bad, giving into it and just generally having a big old, sniffly, snotty pity party.  So, I decided yesterday to just ignore it (hard to do but....) and get on with things.  I have a lot of things to do and I am tired of dealing.So, what is any sane, grown woman to do under these circumstances with this mindset?Clean out her dusty, over-stuffed clothes closet, of course. (Not really a good idea with the dust and all.)Yesterday I started pulling out everything and throwing it away.  Yes, throwing it away.  I have about six knit shirts that have been hanging on the hangers for so long (yes, I know, fold them) that you can't recognize their original shape.  I have a number of blouses that have embroidered details that just scream \"middle age\".  I am middle aged -- no, I am older than middle aged -- in my body, not my mind and I just can't handle sweet little embroidery.  Out! In the pile.I have found slacks I forgot about that have never been worn.  I found jackets I forgot about.  It was a mess.  Marie Kondo would have been in decluttering heaven.So, I got to thinking -- AGAIN -- about wardrobe, body type, personal preference, comfort, climate, who I admire as a fashion role model.  All those things and I have finally come up with an answer.I shall buy a box of 33 gallon garbage bags, cut appropriate holes for head and arms and be done.  A cute pair of flats and some pearls for church should work, don't you think?Ok, maybe not.So, I have decided that a neutral wardrobe is best.  My options are obvious -- denim, black, gray, beige, white, navy and taupe.  I think solids are good for tops or geometric prints -- stripes and polka dots.  I have several pairs of slacks and capris that fit in these categories so I am good to go.  I am overbought on jeans so I won't be buying any more.  In fact, I have just purchased a pair of white ones and black ones so I think I am done on the pants.Tops seems to be my big problem.  I don't like short blouses or shirts so I have to opt for the longer, tunic style.  I can't wear t-shirts because I am an \"apple\" and \"apples\" just look dumpy in t-shirts.  I don't mean to offend but it is true.  I have had to be brutally honest with myself during this little exercise and that is my conclusion.  I also don't care for these \"fitted\" or \"shaped\" shirts that are popular these days (thank you Lands End).  I have several and will keep them as they are practically new and in very good shape due to the good quality (thanks again, Land's End).  With that said,  all those seams to bring the shirt in and fitted are  where I go out and are uncomfortable. I am high waisted but it seems like the waist of the shirt is still higher and I keep wanting to pull it down.  First world problems, what can I say.  Be thankful I have a shirt -- lots of people don't.  Shame on me for complaining.  Anyway, think I have narrowed down the style of blouse or top I need.  My daughter doesn't care for my choices but I am not the tall, willowy person with the gorgeous flowing locks that she is so...be quiet.   I have to work with what I have.  I am a shrinking, apple.  Not an easy thing.  As far as color goes I am sticking with neutrals there as well -- white, black, ivory and blush.  Now, I have a lime green shirt in my closet and I don't know why.  Oh, I bought it.  It is a solid.  It is a good brand but.....it is lime green.  I don't \"do\" lime green -- what was I thinking but since it has been worn possibly once the idea of just tossing it is giving me pause.  It is in my \"dazed and confused\" pile.So, shoes.  I have arthritis.  I can't wear heels.  I never wore really high heels but I did like dressing up and can't now.  So, I have settled in on flats.  I have a couple of pair of Clark's that are really comfy.  One is black and one is camel.  I have a pair of Tieks in taupe that I wear all the time.  All. The. Time.  I need to buy another pair (or four).  I also recently bought a pair of New Balance flip flops.  Being the sort that needs to have her shoes strapped to her feet I was hesitant but they are so comfy and they don't fall off my feet and I haven't tumbled over yet so I say they are a go.  Shoes are problematic as well  -- one foot is a medium and the other a wide.  I have my dad's high arches and really can't stand anything going across the top of my foot (trainers are torture) so flats it will be.  Plus, heavy shoes make me feel like I am walking through quicksand so the Tieks are great.  My husband is just going to have to cope.I only carry one purse -- a Longchamp nylon zipper tote -- LePilage -- in gunmetal gray, the medium size.  I have other options but that is the easiest to deal with and comfortable for me.I used to love jewelry but not so much anymore.  I wear the same things every day.  I guess I am like my Aunt Linnie that way.  She had some \"signature\" jewelry that she wore all the time and didn't deviate from it -- I am the same way.  I guess I am just not very creative.  I am thinking of buying something turquoise to compliment the taupe and white stuff that I am planning on wearing.  If I think about it.So, as I ride out the allergies I am determined to make my closet look like it belongs to a member of the human race.  I have discovered that I am going to have to start ironing again.  That doesn't make me happy.  I don't like to iron.  But, I am going to like being able to go in and get dressed!So, yeah.  Now I have to clean up the bedroom floor where I dumped everything.  Bother.PS -- In case you are wondering who my fashion icon is -- well -- hee hee -- Judi Dench.  She is short, roly poly, wears long, loose blouses and shirts and has gray hair -- what's not to love!  And she has a wicked sense of humor from what I have read."},

I Didn't Mean To!", "date": "Monday, May 08, 2017", "text": "In my previous blog-- a meme -- I said I didn't have any pet peeves.  I didn't really think I did but now I think I do.  I guess I lied although I didn't mean to. Ok, listen up, it is like this.PBS and BBC have done a nasty thing.  A DANG nasty thing!  When they first aired \"Home Fires\" I started watching it and then didn't.  A few weeks ago I picked it back up and was really into it.  Last night was supposed to be the season finale.  It was, however, the SERIES finale.  Yes, it just ended.  No storylines were concluded all neat and tidy.  The characters were going about their business like it would continue.  But....it just stopped.There was supposed to be a season 3 but BBC and PBS decided to just not do that.  So, nobody knows how anything ends.  After a little google search I learned that the author who wrote the book the series is based on is going to write three more books to bring it to completion.So, I went to B&N today and bought the original book that the series was based on.  I figured that I may as well start from the beginning.  The next book is due out in July.  This is so annoying!!! Ok, rant over but honestly, HOW RUDE!!!!!"},

Scott Fitzgerald.   5) Worst Habit?Well, let's see.  I have given up cookies and soda and practically all caffeine.  I don't smoke, drink or cavort -- so I guess I don't have any.  Maybe not taking all makeup off before I hit the sack.  Oh wait, I have given up makeup as well.  Well,blah. I guess I don't have any. 6) If you saw me walking down the street would you offer me a ride?If I knew you, of course.  If not, sorry, who knows who you might be. 7) What is your favorite sport?Not the sporty sort but I like watching gymnastics and Texas A&M football.  8) What would you do if you were stuck in an elevator with me?Freak out.  It's not you, it's me -- don't care for elevators for that exact reason -- the possibility of getting stuck in said box attached to a rope. 9) Worst thing to ever happen to you?I would have to say losing my parents. 10) Tell me one weird fact about you.I have had what I feel are visitation dreams from my father. Also, a couple of disturbing recurring dreams. 11) What if I showed up at your house unexpectedly?I would ask you in.  But don't ask for refreshments as I haven't really fully grocery shopped for about six months.  It is not that I can't grocery shop but rather that I really, really hate grocery shopping -- not my idea of good time.  I might start ordering online. 12) If you could change one thing about how you look, what would it be?I would be thinner.  You would think I would be with my grocery shopping situation. 13) Would you be my crime partner or my conscience?Depends 14) Ever been arrested?Ha! No.  But I did get a traffic ticket once for something my husband did -- or did not -- do.  It involved license plates.  I had to go to court to dispute it.  I made him go with me and I made sure everybody within earshot knew it wasn't my circus or my monkeys.  Still a bit miffed about it but you probably can't tell that.15) If you won $10,000 today, what would you do with it?I would  put part of it in the bank and use the rest for a good cause.  16) Favorite thing to do in your spare time?I could say reading or cross stitching or watching British tv  -- all viable options --but with the amount of time I spend on the computer I guess being on the computer is what I do the most.  That isn't good, is it? 17) Biggest pet peeve?Eh, I am not a peevy sort of person.  Is that a word? 18) In one word, how would you describe yourself?Blessed 19) Do you believe in/appreciate romance?Oh, sure, I suppose.

{"title": "May?  Is This A Joke?", "date": "Wednesday, May 03, 2017", "text": "How could it possibly be May?  I know that time passes quickly as you get older but it seems to be going at breakneck speed for me!  Somebody posted on Facebook about how many days it is until Christmas!  No, no, make the madness stop. In other news, we have had two cold fronts which have make our temps cooler than they have been in a long time.  I mean turn-on-the-heater-and-grab-a-sweater cooler.  Very jolting to the system for sure.  I can handle it but somebody needs to do something about the gale force winds and the pollen swirling around our heads.  I know, complain, complain, complain -- I will try to refrain.On the reading front I have finally finished \"This Side of Paradise\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  \"Paradise\" was his first work and quite notable.  I enjoyed it and thought it outstanding for a first work (many first works are quite forgettable) but I did have to read more slowly than I am used to and pay more attention to what I was reading.  It is definitely a book to be read, not glossed over.  It isn't as finessed as \"Gatsby\" but still quite enjoyable with it's main character, Amory Blaine, going through life's loves and losses.  I think my favorite female character was Eleanor Savage -- wild, free, lover of literature -- so different than the other female characters -- social debutantes living under the social dictates of the time. I recommend to anyone, especially somebody wanting to experience literature of a bygone era -- much different than today's offerings.I have now picked up the first in the Cedar Cove series by Debbie Macomber -- \"16 Lighthouse Road\".  I rejected this series early on because it just seemed so predictable.  I even refused to watch the television program.  However, during one particularly lean tv viewing time, I did start watching on Netflix and enjoyed the series a good deal.  So, now I have picked up the book (it has been on my Nook forever).  So far, so good.  I doubt I will read the entire series at one time, I tend not to do that, but rather shift between several series that I am reading \"at\".  I also want to start the Hamish MacBeth series by MCBeaton.  I have listened to one or two on audio book and think I would enjoy the series.  The Agatha Raisin series and the Elm Creek series are due a revisit as well.  I see this being a \"very reading summer\". For now that is all I have.  Our little Daisies are bridging to Brownies later this month so there is a lot to do for that.  I will post pictures of the ceremony to be held on my daughter's driveway.  Hint..it will involve a real bridge.  And balloons.  And cake.  It will be glorious.So, for now that is all.  Hopefully something exciting will happen soon -- not TOO exciting though -- I am too old for TOO exciting! Ta!  Later."},
{"title": "Update on New Routine", "date": "Wednesday, April 26, 2017", "text": "How long does a new routine have to be followed before it isn't new anymore?  As you know, we have been following a new routine and it is working well.  The last several days have been challenging but we have managed to eat our main meal at lunch although a few of those meals were restaurants which we are trying to avoid.  However, we did keep to our plan to eat our large meal at lunch and I think we are both feeling better for it.We were remarking, on our way home from our daughter's house today, that neither of us was ravenously hungry.  When we were eating breakfast and a light lunch we were starving by the time we were leaving our daughter's house for home and would then still have to cook which sent us to the restaurants every night.By eating lunch we don't have that long stretch without food so we are able to make it until we get home and can have a light dinner.  I think it is a win-win.  I have lost a bit of weight and I just think going to bed on an emptier stomach is a good thing.The last several days have found me cleaning out the closet and I have taken two bags to the drop off place for donated items.  I have two more bags to take as well.  Then randomly I am going to tackle the kitchen drawers -- they need it.  I am very excited to be getting things cleaned out and organized -- it makes me feel good and I have come to realize it is a never ending job so I don't need to feel bad about it not being finished -- it isn't ever going to be finished!I am still reading the F. Scott Fitzgerald book but I am about done and I am ready to be done.  I have enjoyed it but it hasn't gone quickly and I am wanting to get started on some of my other new books.  I am reading books lately rather than my e-reader because the e-reader books have gotten so expensive! I really love Half Price Books and I can find whatever I want most of the time.  I have decided that during the summer I am going to visit the library, as well.  I miss the library and would like to go more frequently.I am proud of myself that I have kicked the cookie habit.  I am a serious cookie addict.  I can pass up anything else but cookies are just too enticing.  But, I have managed to stop eating them and haven't really had any (except for the madeleine at church) for almost two months. I feel so accomplished! I have weight issues and honestly, sweets are the problem.  I have broken the addiction to sodas (that was a big one) and now cookies (the other problem) and I feel so much better for it.  Not that I feel better physically but emotionally because I actually took hold of the problem.  Yay!I have been binge watching \"As Time Goes By\" on Britbox and am loving it.  I have watched this series many times but never in order and it is quite fun.  I think I might start on Dr. Who when this one is done.  I would like to start EastEnders but I don't know how easy it would be to start a soap opera.  I did watch Coronation Street a bit when I had Hulu but I stopped.  I will see how that goes.So, that is me up to now.  Oh yes, Bean decided to write a book -- her life up to now (she is 6).  On the first page she said \"I was born when Mommy got me out of her tummy\".  And then asked me what happened next.  Not much progress has been made but she makes me smile."},
{"title": "The Little Couple", "date": "Saturday, April 22, 2017", "text": "For the last several summers we have had families of cardinals living in our yard and the one next door.  I noticed our latest couple a few days ago but managed to get some snaps this morning.They are very pudgy and the cool weather this morning has made them very frisky - if you can call a bird frisky.  At any rate, they are all over the yard and burrowing down in the jasmine -- I wonder if they are what is stealing my strawberries?So, anyway, meet the little couple!The MisterThe MissusSorry for the poor quality of the photos but I was inside the house and every time they saw me move they took off so this was the best I could do!My husband and I have always been a pretty good match in all areas.  I guess that is why we have stayed together for so long.  However, as we have gotten older we seem to have different ideas of temperature.  He is always cold.  I am always hot.  Now, during the day that doesn't seem to be a problem but at night....totally different story.I have always liked comforter sets  -- you know, with the matching components but I really don't like pillow shams.  They are a nuisance.  So, three or four years ago I bought an American made heirloom bedspread.  I had two of these when I first married and I really liked them, too.This is the exact bedspread that I bought-- a Bates-style bedspread which you can get with pillow shams or long enough to cover the pillows.  This was important because my husband is paranoid about having the pillow covered. He seems to have a \"thing\" about dust.The only problem with this is that my husband wouldn't sleep under it -- he said it was too heavy even though it is one of the \"lightweight\" bedspreads offered.  So, he would roll it all the way down to the foot of the bed and then pile a quilt on top of him.  Sometimes two.  No, I didn't understand either.Because he is so cold all the time we also have two cotton blankets on the bed as well.  Needless to say that I -- in my permanent hot-flash state -- was miserable and I told him we had to do something so off came the quilts and I have forced him to sleep under the blankets and the bedspread.  He has adapted.However, I have been thinking about a down alternative comforter and a duvet cover.  I like the way Europeans use a bottom sheet and the duvet and that is all.  Simplifies bed making for sure.  However, not a problem here because our rule is the last one out is the one who makes the bed and it is NEVER me -- I am an early riser -- or at least early enough to not have to make the bed.  Haha!So, we went looking and then I went to reading.  After reading several articles I have decided to stick with my bedspread/blanket combo. There were a lot of negative reviews of duvets and honestly, I can't imagine wrestling to get the comforter back in the duvet each time I wash the sheets.  Yeah, no.So, I have decided to stay with what I have but I still have the problem of too-cool-hubby and too-warm-moi -- So, what did we do about that?Since it is now early summer here in Texas (seems we didn't feel the need to do spring or winter this year) I have insisted on turning on the ceiling fan.  I woke up to find Hubs with all the layers of bedclothes pulled up to his chin.However, he isn't complaining so I am leaving well enough alone."},
{"title": "I Have Failed at the Art of Tidying Up", "date": "Thursday, April 20, 2017", "text": "I have read articles about Marie Kondo and the Kon Marie method of keeping yourself together.  My cousin even bought me the book which I have read.  However, the book didn't address the concept that some people might be drawer-dysfunctional.That would be me.If I can't see it, I forget I have it.Case in point.  Two days ago I went looking for my pajamas.  I have taken to retiring in athletic shorts and t-shirts because they are quite comfy for this perpetually-too-warm body.  However, I decided that I need to sleep in real pajamas and I knew I had them but where?  After a brief study of the situation I went out to buy some more sleeping duds -- not athletic shorts.  I came home to put them away and when I opened the very last drawer in the dresser in the closet what do you think I found?  Yes.  My pajamas.No, I didn't return the new things. So, yesterday I started cleaning out the disaster that is my closet.  Here in Texas they tell us to go into the closets during a tornado.  My closet look likes the tornado followed me in.Not anymore, though. However, I have a large dresser with 8 drawers (my husband has a matching one with 12 drawers -- yes, it is a large closet) and I am unable to store anything in them because I forget it is there.I found t-shirts neatly folded in the Kon Marie method -- they look lovely.  I have my personal garments folded the same -- except for what I found lost with the pajamas.  And I uncovered six pairs of shoes.  I guess I didn't need them since I wear the Tieks most of the time.  However, I feel a little crazy.My husband's side of the closet is an equal disaster but it is a disaster with his own stuff.  My side of the closet has also been turned over to things like extra blankets and quilts, the boxes of family photos, the Nintendo Wii box, you know, stuff like that.  I am going to be merciless and just ditch it all. I was so good yesterday.  I had two grocery bags (paper) full of neatly folded clothes for donation.  Remember when you could donate things to the little donation bins in the grocery store parking lot?  Well, those little bins have been popping up all over the place again so I thought it would be easy to find someplace to donate the clothes.  I was wrong.  There were two in our Target parking lot just a few weeks ago and now they are gone.  We actually drove all over the place looking for one.  I finally found one but I am not sure it was a good idea to leave things there. I need to find another place because that one gave me the heebie-jeebies.  All I did was open the chute and I felt the need to drown myself in hand sanitizer.  When I opened the chute I was met with all sorts of food trash -- is somebody living in this thing?  I don't know but I will find someplace else.So, this morning I am back at work re-inventing my closet.  Oh, and the shirts that are too big?  Well, I uncovered one that is the smaller size (never worn, BTW, but it was neatly folded in the drawer) and it fits perfectly.I have decided to keep the larger shirts because when I tried to re-order them in the smaller size they didn't have any of the designs I wanted so next time I order things, I will remember to buy the smaller size.  Blah.  Maybe they will shrink in the wash.So, today I am continuing to tackle the closet -- hanging everything in my sight so I won't lose things.  I am sort of beginning to worry about forgetting things.  How can somebody forget their pajamas?  Just doesn't seem right.However, now I am well stocked on pajamas.  Yay."},
{"title": "Annoyed", "date": "Wednesday, April 19, 2017", "text": "Yes, two posts in one day by moi! The world must be coming to an end!  But, I am annoyed.  I buy most of my clothes online.  Why?  Well, I don't enjoy shopping and they have closed all the reasonable stores close to me like Dillards and Macy's.  So, since I don't like to shop anyway and I don't particularly like driving across town in DFW traffic, buying online seems to be a good option for me.So, in March I placed an order for several things and I got them in a timely fashion.  However, I didn't try them on in a timely fashion.I tried them on today.The slacks fit fine but the shirts are too large.So, what am I complaining about?  Who complains about too large?Seems I just assumed they would fit so I threw all the packing material and return labels  away.  I have the pouch they were mailed in but no paperwork.I contacted the company and they assured me there was no problem, just print a new label from the website and send them on.I really wanted these shirts -- so I jumped online to just re--order them in a smaller size and guess what!!???None of the patterns I purchased is available anymore in a smaller size.  Not sure if they ever will be.  So....that is why I am annoyed.I would be less annoyed if it was THEIR fault but it is my fault so I am REALLY annoyed.Guess I better go print that label.Sheesh.I am still chipping away at \"This Side of Paradise\" (not such a page turner but not willing to give up) but I decided to take a second-long break and read a children's book titled \"Little Bo--The Story of Bonnie Boadicea\" by Julie Andrews Edwards.  Yes, that Julie Andrews.It is a children's book and it is large and has pictures which I guess qualifies it to be a picture book but it is lengthy for a picture book, almost 100 pages so I think it is a tad more than a picture book.  My granddaughter brought it home from the school library so I had to read fast as it is due on Thursday.In any event, it is the story of Sarabande and Bounder -- she being the gorgeous Persian cat belonging to Mrs. Edge and the street cat -- Bounder -- a sort of feline Lady and the Tramp, if you will.  Sarabande has a litter of kittens and Mrs. Edge who is very hard-edged decides to keep the one that looks like Sarabande and tells her mean hearted butler to take the rest to the pet store.  As it happens the pet store won't take them and the butler, who didn't like them anyway, had a bicycle accident and the kittens all get away.  It was a dark and rainy night and they all scattered for parts unknown.The story focuses on Boadicea -- or Bo for short -- as she is the smallest and most helpless.  Lest you think she drowns in the gutter or something I will tell you that she is rescued and goes on an unbelievable adventure and scores herself a human that has strong values. I won't say anymore, however, because it is a good book and I recommend you reading it for yourself.I did think it ended rather unceremoniously and a bit flat, leaving the reader to want more.  However, after a bit of research, there is more.  There are other \"Bo\" books out there and I, for one, am going to read them."},
{"title": "It Is All in the \"S\"", "date": "Monday, April 17, 2017", "text": "Sorry I haven't been here in a few days but I have been nursing the latest allergy attack along and really haven't felt like doing much.  However, I am bored with not doing much so I am ignoring the allergies -- seems like the thing to do!One thing I have been doing the last few days is surfing the internet about skin care and how French women take care of their skin.  Several months ago I stumbled across an American skincare line that I really like, First Aid Beauty, and have sort of gotten on the skincare bandwagon.  My skin was never, even in teen-age years, tragic.  I never had a lot of problems with it and that hasn't changed.  The thing I have always had a problem with, however, is makeup.  I don't play nice with makeup.  So, I decided to see if I could improve my skin to the point that I don't actually need to wear much makeup.  I have been told by skin care \"people\" that I don't need it but I was never comfortable.  I always have always felt like I need to do something and I decided that something would be skincare.So, I was doing a little study of the products that French women use and I ran across micellar water.  Now, I have used micellar water before but I wanted to try what the French women used.  Seems there are two brands --Bioderma and Vichy.  So, I ordered the Bioderma online because it can't be purchased locally and this is what I got--cute little wrapping paper in a plain brown boxmore packaging-- bottle wrapped in brown paper, tied with cream and black cord and nestled in copious amounts of black tissue paper -- felt elegantViola -- the bottleTwo days later I walked into Walgreens and found the entire Vichy line right there -- no ordering!!! That sort of thing always happens to me.So, I have been doing the skincare thing but in reading about French women I learned that they always choose a signature scent and stick with it.My aunt, who was very glamorous and a fashion buyer for a large department store, had a signature scent.  It was called Fleurs de Rocaille (Rock Garden).  This is a scent that I will never forget -- ever.  She wore it so much it permeated everything she owned.  I loved it.  At some point it became difficult to find so I asked my husband to buy me some on one of his trips to France.  He did.  It was wrong.  It didn't smell the same -- AT ALL.  Apparently there was a new (1994) formulation aimed at the American audience and that is what he bought.  I went to a perfumerie here to by some of the \"original\" stuff for my cousin and was assured it was the original formulation (1934)  but it wasn't.  I bought it anyway thinking I just couldn't smell anymore.So, the other day when I was doing all my research on French women I started looking for this perfume.  It seems that the 1934 formulation was called FLEURS de Rocaille.  The 1994 version is FLEUR de Rocaille -- just one fleur.  So, I went to a site called Lucky Scent and found the 1934 version which is still being manufactured and I promptly had them send me a sample.  I was ecstatic when I got it in the mail today.I just knew I was going to pop the lid off that tiny vial and be transported to my youth and be in the presence of my aunt again.  I didn't even smell it in the vial I just put some on my wrist and guess what -- it is WRONG.  It isn't anywhere near the scent that I was so familiar with. I was so disappointed! After a while, it was so strong I had to go wash it off.  So, I decided a little spritz of Chanel #5 was in order.  Even that was too strong.  I haven't really worn perfume in a long, long time for a lot of reasons and I guess my poor little nose just can't handle it anymore.  By the time I got the Chanel washed off I was sniffling and my eyes were running and, well.....I guess I am just never going to be a French fashionista."},
{"title": "Happy Thursday! Or Random Post Because I am All Drugged up on Allergy Meds", "date": "Thursday, April 06, 2017", "text": "Good morning! I am trying to sound perky when I am really not.  I have seasonal allergies which seem to span almost all four seasons now and I take Claritin everyday.  For the most part it works except for when it doesn't.  That would be yesterday.Our pollen count is off the charts, the wind has blowing gale force and, of course, I had to venture outside.  And breathe.  So, yesterday morning I got up having a horrible allergy attack.  I took the Claritin and bingo! Nothing happened! I just got worse.  Finally at about 7 p.m. I took some Benadryl and was down for the count.  I slept nine hours.  I feel better but not great.  I am out of benadryl and don't really want to stay drugged all day so I took the Claritin as usual this morning.  Hopefully I can hold it together until I get some more Benadryl and it is time for bed.In other news -- I have a new project for Hubs.  Hubs loves projects.  Hubs needs projects.  If he doesn't have projects he shops -- worse than a girl.  So, this morning I got up with this brilliant idea about battery operated lamps.We have a circular entryway.  It is two story and sports a very large, very lovely chandelier.We rarely use it because it just isn't the sort of lighting to warm up a spot.  We have a small chest in there along with two curio cabinets, unlit.  I need a lamp.  So, what is the problem you might ask?  Well, the brilliant builder decided that there only needed to be one base plug in there and not in the right place.  Yes, Hubs could drop a line but that would require cutting sheetrock and I hate cutting holes in walls.  I also hate hanging pictures and such because I just don't like holes in walls.  So, anyway, that made me think about battery operated lamps.I looked online and there are a few, some quite acceptable, options.  However, I then ran across a tutorial about converting a regular lamp to a wireless lamp using batteries and led light strips.  My husband loves led light strips and has just installed some behind out television.  So......you can see where I am going with this.He isn't awake right now but when he gets up I am going to let him know what his next project is.  I am sure he will love me for it.An update on our new eating plan --It is working well for me.  I haven't lost a lot of weight but something is changing because all my clothes are loose -- don't understand that -- but I will take it.  It is much easier cooking a large noontime meal than an evening meal.  I don't know that Hubs is really doing as well with it but I feel better so I will keep it up. It has certainly helped with between meal eating.  I haven't had a cookie in a month and haven't had to fight the craving -- there hasn't been a craving.  I think that is more mind over matter but whatever it is, it is a good thing.  My acid reflux is non-existent.  That is a relief for sure. My energy level has increased by leaps and bounds and I am not sure why changing our eating schedule would have anything to do with that but it seems to.  I am getting things done in the morning (I am a morning person anyway) and I am keeping up with things.  I seem to have a new discipline that I never had before.  It is amazing.  I know that sounds silly but it is amazing to me. I guess you really are never too old to learn new things.  Hmmmm.So, now I need another cuppa.  I have a sore throat and my nose is still runny and it just really aggravates me so I am sure another tea will help.Have a nice day and I will let you know how the lamp project goes."},

This little church was originally the Watauga Presbyterian Church but is now the home to a hispanic Christian community.  Isn't it just a lovely little building?  Can't you see this being the center of activity of a small community many generations ago?  I can.Then there is this church.  Bethel Baptist Church in Scranton, Pennsylvania -- the church home of my great-grandparents James and Dinah Davies.This is how the church looked when my grandparents attended thereA bit latermuch more currentSadly, this church ceased being a church back in November (2016) when they decided that the population had dwindled to the point that the church couldn't be supported. At that time there were 10 members.  I think it would make a very lovely house.  Of course, I never saw it in person but I think it is a perfectly lovely little neighborhood church.This is St. Joseph's Catholic Church, Elk, TX.  It is the church that my husband's family attended as they lived close by.  Clearly this is not the original church but it is the one I am familiar with.  There is also a cemetery on the property behind the church.This is my current church here in Fort Worth.  It is absolutely beautiful and when you walk in there is no mistaking that you are in church. It is truly one of the most beautiful churches I have ever been in.The church I was married in -- Concordia Lutheran Church, San Antonio --yes, that is me and Hubs taking our vows -- did I really promise to obey?  Hahaha!The church I grew up in as a child, Asbury Methodist Church --And the last church I attended before we left San Antonio -- Mt.

Don't give away too much information!My current read is This Side of Paradise by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  My sentences come from page 20:\"After reproving him for avoiding her, she took him for a long tete-a-tete in the moonlight. He could not reconcile himself to her beauty, that was mother to his own, the exquisite neck and shoulders, the grace of a fortunate woman of thirty.\"I seem to be in the mood to read older fiction right now by the likes of  Fitzgerald and Hemingway -- does anybody else still read these authors?Well, it has been a few days since we started our new life plan here at Maison Brinkley. I have to say it is going well.  I am a morning person (i.e. if it isn't done before noon, it isn't going to happen) so this new scheme  just plays into my sensibilities.I have discovered that cooking a main meal to be eaten about 11:30 a.m. isn't a problem at all in the morning.  In the evening it is damn near impossible because of our schedule.  So, since Saturday we have been eating \"dinner\" (a large, noon meal) and I am proud to say that the meal was eaten and my kitchen was spotless before my soap opera came on.  That makes me feel good and accomplished.I had hoped that this change would make changes in our health.  The results?  I am losing weight -- slowing but I am losing it.  My husband's blood sugar was very low yesterday -- not too low, it never gets too low -- but low enough to see the difference.  Mission Accomplished.So, for today's meal I am doing something different.  I am not a fan of crock pots even though I have two.  One I never use and the other I use when I have no choice since we are gone from the house everyday.  No, I am not afraid to go away and leave it on \"low\".  Anyway, I didn't want to use the crock pot this morning so I decided to research slow cooking in the oven.  Seems it can be done since millions of homemakers before me did exactly that before there was such a thing as crock pots. My grandmother had an stove that had four burners and a \"well\" that could be used for things such as stew and chicken and dumplings.  It cooked slowly and yes, those were the best chicken and dumplings I ever tasted.  Think Aga. Slow cooking in a regular oven can be done -- or so I have read.So, I dug down deep in the cabinet and I found this --This isn't mine, mine is a lovely dusty aqua hue.  But, it is the same thing.  The idea is to put your food in it, put ice in the depression of the lid which will allow condensation from the inside to drip off little bumps in the lid into your food to keep it moist and succulent.  I have used mine once but I decided that I would give it a go today.So, I browned some seasoned, floured stew meat, added some mushrooms and  a cup of water, put the lid on, added the ice and placed it in a pre-heated 300 degree oven.  This was at 7:20 a.m.  Hopefully it will be done by 11:30.  I will let you know how it turns out --if it turns out.I may be a morning person but I have never been a breakfast person so this new eating plan is a bit challenging in that regard.  In order for a person to eat the majority of his/her calories by mid-day, breakfast  has to happen.  So, I decided to go the whole 90 yards and actually eat at the table, a proper meal and see how it goes.This was breakfast --an English muffin with a bit of butter (just a bit) and a bit of cherry jelly, six prunes and a half a container of yogurt -- only half though because the first ingredient is sugar.  A cup of green ginger tea and my meds with a glass of water.  Hopefully that is going to get me through until lunch.  I actually sat at the table and did my Bible study at the same time.  I am trying to get on a regular routine of Bible study and this seemed like a perfect time to do that.So, my day is started, my laundry is caught up, lunch is in the oven (did you know you can cook rice in the oven as well?) and the house is reasonably picked up.  So, what to do?Oh yes, I am having a telephone coffee break with my cousin Elaine at 9 a.m.! That should be fun!  Doing a bit of genealogy together.  Isn't technology wonderful?  A telephone.  Not facetime or skype, not email --- just a regular old telephone call.Telephone calls, slow cooking in an oven -- just call me progressive."},

{"title": "Old Fashioned Ways and Intuitive Eating", "date": "Saturday, March 25, 2017", "text": "It is no surprise to anybody who has read this blog for a while that I have a love/hate relationship with food.  About two weeks ago I realized that I was having a lot of acid reflux issues.  So, what does any self-respecting individual do in that situation?  I googled \"acid reflux\".  I was handed several pages of things to do to eliminate the issue -- reduce fat intake, reduce portions, reduce acid consumption....operative word -- reduce.  So, I decided to re-think \"intuitive eating\".I have never really \"gotten\" intuitive eating.  Oh, I understand the principals but to actually feel the feeling -- well, it is hard to do when you are sitting with a bag of Chips Ahoy on your lap.  So, after a particularly unpleasant evening of \"refluxing\" I decided to figure out what that \"feeling\" was and start listening to it.The next morning I did just what all the articles said -- I reduced -- everything.  Long about mid-morning I recognized the feeling that I was supposed to identify as hunger.  I ate a small snack, just to eliminate the pangs.  Then lunch came along and while I was hungry I was satisfied enough to make good meal choices.  Mid-afternoon, again with the hunger pangs.  Repeat morning routine.  Dinner rolls around and I do the same with reduced portions.  I go to bed -- not really hungry (I could have eaten a cookie or a dozen) but I didn't, just hit the sack and I slept the soundest I have slept in a long time.I have continued the process for a couple of weeks, I have lost three pounds, I have apparently successfully shrunk my stomach because I am not hungry enough between meals to require a snack.I would say I have successfully mastered \"intuitive eating\".That brings us to the \"old fashioned\" part of this blog title. Back in the \"old days\" the main meal was eaten at lunch.  Farmers would go to the fields at dawn and their wives would go to the kitchen to prepare a hearty mid-day meal.  The farmers would come in and refuel for the afternoon's work and the wives would save the leftovers for \"supper\" and continue on with their chores for the day.In a more modern world, my cousin Dessie used to run her house like this for her husband Pete and their two children, right smack in the middle of San Antonio -- no farmers here and not in the 19th century!So, I have been thinking about the concept of a bigger noonday meal.  We have late afternoon obligations on a daily basis.  This generally sends us straight to the restaurants.  We both have weight issues and my husband is diabetic -- and he now has a spare tire that looks a bit out of place on his lanky frame.  So, I have decided to further adjust the eating issue in this house. I read an article that eating a main mid-day meal is healthier overall and for diabetics, it helps with the blood sugar.  So, Hubs is used to eating a light lunch and a full dinner and I am just going to reverse it.I feel the benefits will outweigh the negatives.  I won't waste so much food because I still grocery shop like I am feeding a teenage boy! I thaw meat, don't get around to cooking it, toss it -- it is a travesty.  Also, I can control all that salt and fat and heaven knows what else that is in the food.  And.....I can get the kitchen cleaned up early and not wait until I am completely bushed.  We will then have our \"light\" lunch for dinner and then go to bed empty.  My husband tends to snack a lot, beginning as he leaves he dinner table so if he feels his blood sugar will drop too much he can have a snack before bed.  For me, I think I prefer going to bed empty --and waking up empty!I am anxious to go back in time to explore this old fashioned way of life.  I am hoping that we will both reap health benefits from it and that my pocketbook likes the change as well!Does anybody here eat their main meal at mid-day?  Thoughts?"},

The coffee was ready when it finished \"perking\".  I don't think many people \"perk\" anymore.  I digress.So, anyway, thinking about yesterday's post I took a little walk down memory lane visiting my former abodes. When we were first married we lived in an apartment --Our apartment was just across the courtyard from this one with the dutch looking one in the middle.  I have some photos but I am just too lazy to go find them so I got this off an apartment rental website but you get the idea.  It was a cute apartment, really sort of fancy at the time -- it had a sunken living room with steps up to the dining room/kitchen and bedroom.  Those steps proved to be quite dangerous if you were racing through with socks on.  Experience?  Oh yes.Then, after a year of my husband trying to create a workshop in a closet we decided we needed a house with a garage.  So, we looked in a little local newspaper called the Northside Recorder and found this one -- easily assumable with hardly anything down and the monthly payments were less than the apartment so we moved.This house went through many changes.  We moved the front door, we closed in the front porch, we put french doors on the garage, we added a very large family room, we remodeled the kitchen several times and created a large laundry room.  The current owners have made more changes and not for the better.  I liked it better when it was mine and a different color.  This is the house we lived in when my children were born and lived a good portion of their childhoods.Then we got transferred.We lived here--This is a photo off realtor.com.  This is where my children lived their teenage years.  It was a nice house but the neighborhood was aging so we decided to move on before we became too aged.Here is where we are now--poor, lonely little unadorned gate.  I was going to go yesterday to find something to embellish it but that never happened.So, what is all the point of this you ask?  Other than me looking at my own evolution?Well, there is no point except to show you that if I were going to make one more move, money were no object and I could actually build it myself this is where I would be...and this what the bedrooms would look like ...but since that probably isn't going to happen I am turning my thoughts toward this...That isn't asking too much, now is it?"},

I hate allergies because all I want to do is go outside.I don't like my sofa but I feel guilty for not liking my sofa -- some people don't have a sofa and I am lousy for being a sofa snob.I am slowing down and I actually like it.  I feel like I have been on some sort of a race all my life and now I am not.  Whew -- a sigh of relief.I don't like to cook, sew, or clean.  I  have given up hobbies because of the mess they make.  The truth is, I didn't like them to begin with but felt like I \"should\" like them.I secretly want my husband to cut my hair with his new clippers.  It would be bad but I feel like it would be fun.I wish I had a screen door so the kids could slam it and I could tell them to stop.I wish I lived somewhere that there wasn't an HOA.I am falling out of love with technology except for Rosy, my new iphone.  I still love her.I want to travel around Texas, maybe on the train.I wish I could draw.I wish I hadn't sold my piano and I wish I had practiced more.I wish I could go to San Antonio for a couple of weeks and just \"be\" there again for a while.I miss the 50's and the 60's.  If I could go back just for a day, oh the things I would change!I have a tendency to live in the past.I am a deeper thinker than most people think I am.Ok, now I need lunch.Have a great Saturday!"},

{"title": "One Thing Always Leads to Another...", "date": "Monday, March 06, 2017", "text": "The other day, while looking for tea kettles, we visited our local Sur la Table and William Sonoma.  WS (or Billy S as my husband refers to it) was always the go-to shop for cooking items and kitchenware.  A few months ago our neighborhood acquired a new Sur la Table and my, oh my, what a fantastic place for all things gadget-y.  Now, granted, we didn't come home with a tea kettle from either of those places but that doesn't mean that we came home empty handed.From Sur la Table I scored these cute little cookie presses.  I make a sugar cookie that you roll into a ball and smash with the bottom of a buttered/sugared glass to make it cookie shaped. I thought these would be much nicer than a plain cookie!  I especially like the honey bee motif.  When I was a child my mother told me that my name means \"honey bee\" or \"sweetener, sweet\" so I have always gravitated to \"bee\" inspired things.From WS I picked up these two spoons.  I really don't like wooden spoons so I buy silicone.  My daughter has had these for years and they have held up beautifully so I decided to gift myself with them.I think it would be better if I didn't mention these little goodies....I didn't come home with those because....well, just because.  It will be a great gift idea when \"some-husband\" can't think of anything to buy me!In other news, it is spring here for all practical purposes.  We have had a couple of gray and rainy days here over the weekend but the fact of the matter is, it is going to be 80 here today and no way that can still be considered winter. I have proof...Look at the redbud!  The crabapple is looking much the same but the pears are lagging a bit behind.We have five yaupon hollies across the back fence and they were still heavy with berries.  They are usually stripped clean by the waxwings but they seemed a bit late this year.  Then, yesterday, there was a flurry in the trees and the trees were so full of wax-wings they looked like a bird tree! In no time those berries were stripped off those trees and the birds were gone. It happened so fast that I didn't have time to find the camera and snap a pic.  I wish I had though -- it probably would have been better if it was a video -- but it was quite the sight to see.  Maybe next year I can get a photo.Not much went on this weekend.  We are now looking for a new television.  Ours isn't quite gone yet so we have some time to research and shop which is my husband's favorite thing to do.  The television was mounted on the wall so we managed to take it down and put it on the stand.  I need to lift weights -- that thing was heavy and, while I used to be quite strong in my upper body, I am not strong anymore so lifting the televison was a bit of a stretch for me but we got it down and all is ready for a new set when the time is right.  I  am not one to replace things before their time (like they really have to just give up the ghost for me to replace) or if I get a good deal and know that it is just a matter of time.  So, whenever it happens we are ready and we will no longer put a television on the wall.  Way too much trouble.So, here is wishing you a fabulous week! See you on the blog-side!"},
{"title": "The Quest is Over", "date": "Friday, March 03, 2017", "text": "As you know, Hubs and I have been looking for a replacement for our recently deceased electric kettle.  After having replaced kettles on a nearly yearly basis, we decided to go with a stove top model.  We have looked at everything from All-Clad to OXO, from big to little, to plain to fancy and from cheap to expensive.  Not being able to make a decision other than we didn't want to mortgage the house to buy a kettle, we made an impulse buy last night.  We stopped at our neighborhood Target store to pick up dishwasher detergent and we ran across this.Yes, I will say that I purchased it for the color but what would you  expect from someone who chooses books by the cover art.  I haven't tried it yet but Hubs has and he says the whistle will wake the dead.  I didn't hear it as I was drying my hair but I will take his word for it.In other news, I have been trying to make Facebook a kinder, gentler place (ha! futile, just futile) so I have been posting photos of my favorite things.  I like garden gates and light houses, history facts and inspirational quotes.  Well, ok, maybe not the quote thing so much but honestly, anything but the nastiness that is regularly spewed on FB.So, today I posted this photo and thought I would share it here --This is a painting by a Texas artist named Dalhart Windberg.  He is a native Texan, born in Goliad in 1933 and living in Georgetown, Texas.  He specializes in landscapes of the Texas hill country as well as other areas of the state. We own a print of this painting and I always thought it looked familiar to me, like I \"knew\" it.  Then it dawned on me that it looked just like the entrance to the Harper Cemetery, Harper, Texas.This is what the entrance looks like now but years ago there was an old wooden gate (exactly like that in the painting) that you had to jump on to unlatch.  Then, about thirty years ago there was a steel farm gate that you didn't have to jump on but you did have to unlatch it.  Now there is no gate -- I would assume that the gates were removed when it was made a community cemetery rather than a family cemetery.  It is all cleaned up now, not as \"rustic\" as it used to be and there are many new names there.  It has grown, is taken care of and is truly a testament to the pioneer families of the Texas Hill country.  If you visit this link, you can see photos of all the headstones there -- http://www.fbgtxgensoc.org/photos/har/index.shtml. The Harper Cemetery started out as a family cemetery.  Anybody related to the Rogers Family could be buried there.  If you visit the link above and look at the headstones  you are traveling through my paternal family tree.  Boyett's, Giles's, Bierschwale's, Rogers -- yes, that is me on my paternal grandmother's side of the family.  There is a lot of history there was well.So, anyway, that was my \"gate\" for the day.  I have been posting lovely photos of gates in magazines and on pinterest but today I decided to post one that had personal meaning to me.  Welcome to my world."},

This morning it was really red and sore and hurts to bend it but I am able to bend it so I assume it is just jammed. So, about Tuesday's child -- yeah, dumb poem."},

{"title": "Introducing Rosy", "date": "Friday, February 17, 2017", "text": "Ok, this is how yesterday went.  I was awakened five times in the night by my mother-in-law calling the wrong number on her new cell phone that she doesn't know how to work.  I question the wisdom of giving a 95 year old a smart phone -- I wouldn't have done it.  Anyway, she was trying to call the front desk of her assisted living place and she kept calling us. When we answered the phone she didn't answer.  It was nerve wracking and scary and maddening all at the same time.  We didn't think we would be able to get back to sleep.  My morning was clearly not stellar.So, I got up determined to solve the phone issue.  I called t-mobile.  They gave me a price and I was all up for it but they told me they didn't have any in stock.  Grrr....mood not improving.  So, I called the Apple store -- a place I avoid like the plague -- they had what I wanted, they gave me a price for everything I was looking for and yes, they would be happy to help me.  I left the house at 10:30 -- about a 15 minute drive from my house.  I got there, overwhelmed by the number of people in the store, told the guy what I wanted -- exactly -- and in about 10 minutes I was on my way.  I stopped by t-mobile to get the newly required SIM card only to find that I didn't need a new SIM card.  So, I headed home with my new phone, a new case and a car charger. Actually I walked in the door a little before 11:30 so it was a very quick trip even with travel time.  I think the saleman knew I wasn't in the mood to mess around. I didn't buy the service policy but  I am considering it -- I have 60 days to decide.So, anyway, meet Rosy!  I hope we get on well together -- so far so good.Then, my daughter forgot that Beanie had today off school.  I hadn't written down the spring school schedule yet on my calendar so I was clueless as well so guess who came home with me yesterday and spent the night.  She is enjoying her usual Nona breakfast of chocolate chip pancakes and watching Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3.Sorry she is a little blurry.So, that is how my day started.  I have a hair appointment later, she is getting her bangs trimmed and a couple of shopping stops before she goes back home for the girl scout meeting tonight.Yesterday was sort of scattered and out of control but it all ended up good."},
{"title": "Phone Misery and Phone Envy", "date": "Thursday, February 16, 2017", "text": "Phones seem to be the bane of my existence these days.  Not my land line.  My land line is fine.  We understand each other.  It sits there in the cradle and chills until it rings.  I answer it and all is good.  When it is a telemarketer I don't answer it.  It gets it. My cell phone is a completely different story.  We are not soulmates.  We actually hate each other.  I bought this phone about a year and a half ago -- maybe a little longer -- and it has been a love/hate relationship from the beginning.  I rarely talk on the thing -- we text all. the. time.  It is simple, it is easy, it keeps us from getting into conversations that end of a bit combative.  By \"we\" I mean my dear daughter and myself.  I don't verbally express myself too well sometimes and she only listens with one ear so there is a lot of misunderstanding going on which leads to ...well, you get the picture.  Texting is much, much easier.  Except for when it isn't.  My texts tend to fail.  I can type a nice long text message and it fails.  I retype it, a shorter version, and it fails.  I finally end up texting \"call me\" and it fails.  I have to turn the phone off and back on to get the text to go.  I don't get texts in a timely manner either -- one day it took two days to get to me.It is the phone. Not the carrier.So, I go to my handy dandy T-mobile store across the street where we usually do business.  I walk up to the display with the Apple iphone SE.  The price tag says $384 in big letters/numbers.  They tell me that is the price with a contract.  I don't have a contract.  I don't want a contract.  I just want a phone.  Well, in that case, it will cost me $441.00 with the addition of a new SIM card.  That was posted on the price tag in such small letters that I needed a magnifying glass to see it.I walked out and said I needed to think.I came home and looked at the Apple website.  It is the internet's version of a glossy magazine.  Eye candy.  No prices.  Anywhere.  Apparently you can buy the phone in the store SIM-free for $449 but I didn't get that from the website.  Then you can go to the carrier and buy the SIM card and link it to your account. This whole thing is a major pain in the neck.  So, I decided to check out the no-contract phones at Target which is where I got my current phone.  Apparently Target doesn't carry T-Mobile products anymore.By this time I am banging my head against a virtual wall.  So, this morning, I am going to call both T-Mobile and the Apple store and get a price on the phones.  I can't believe I am actually considering spending that sort of cash on a stupid telephone.  However, we are caregivers for a six year old and we are on call for a 95 year old so, unless I want to just stay in my house next to my trusty landline, I have to have a reliable phone.  FYI -- my husband doesn't believe in cell phones, will only carry one under duress and won't turn it on unless he needs to make a call --- to bad if you are trying to find him.  So, he has leisurely hours at Lowe's and Home Depot to just stroll around and peruse the offerings -- me, I have to be in control and available at all times.Blah.So, I am hoping they have the phone in Rose Gold, 64 GB and that I don't have to sell my first born to get it -- his wife and children probably wouldn't like that. Wish me luck --"},
{"title": "This and That", "date": "Wednesday, February 15, 2017", "text": "Good morning!  I went to bed late last night and slept in a bit this morning but I woke up as the sun peeked through the shutter-- a pleasant sight from the cold, gray days we have been having.  I got used to summer quickly and then poof! it was gone.  Now it is back and I am happy.So far this morning I have had a bowl of cereal and cleaned out the refrigerator since the trash men come today.  I will be tackling the freezer and the pantry later.  I declared today to be the pantry cleaning day.  The pantry has become the storage place for a lot of things other than food -- mostly small appliances. I had three crock pots -- two of my own and one of my mother-in-law's.  I gave one of mine to my daughter-in-law and then put my mother-in-law's back out in the garage with the rest of her stuff we are storing.  I will keep the one I have because you can put the liner on the stove and brown things in it before you set it to slow cook.  I don't know why I bother though because my husband doesn't like food cooked in a slow cooker.  C'est la vie!I have a rather old bread maker which I don't really use anymore.  I don't like the shape of the loaf.  So, when we moved my MIL and I brought some of her stuff home I tried her bread maker.  Better shaped loaf but I didn't like the bread it made.  So, out to the garage it went.  I find I prefer using my stand mixer and just making regular bread.  My stand mixer kneads it for me and that is good enough.  The bread recipe I use is great so it turns out wonderful.  I really should make bread more often. And butter.  Sounds like a diet destruction looking for a place to happen.So, anyway, today I plan to reclaim the pantry for food.  Then I have to grocery shop.I really don't like Walmart.  Yesterday evening, around 6 p.m., my husband and I went into the one across the street to buy some hair clippers for him.  We checked out and as I was putting things away in my purse I was aware of a man VERY close to me.  It was like he was shuffling around me, first on one side, then the other, then behind me -- it was like I couldn't get away from him.  My husband was walking ahead of me and I asked him to stop for a minute and I just stopped walking.  The guy almost ran into me and I stepped on him.  I turned around and gave him \"the\" look and he just took off.  I am sure I was about to get purse snatched or picked, one of the two.  I carry a big tote and it has a zipper.  I was putting my receipt away and then zipped the purse up.  It was on my elbow and not my shoulder.  I think he was trying some \"fancy footwork\" on me to confuse me.  He just made me angry.  That tote is so heavy, I could have hit him with it and done some real bodily harm.  The only harm done was that I got angry, he got his feet stepped on and it just reinforced my dislike of Walmart.I felt terrible yesterday -- I thought I was coming down with the flu in spite of getting the shot.  Seems it was just my allergies rearing their ugly head again.  So, after some aspirin and mucinex and a little nap I felt better and improved as the evening went on.  I still wasn't in the best of mood when I encountered the guy at Walmart but I didn't feel sick so that was good.  This morning, yep, I see the allergies are still there but I have energy and I think it will get better as the day goes on.Still working on the cross stitch and have a couple of sewing projects I would like to work on after I finish cleaning out the freezer.  I am determined to get my \"stuff\" under control here and get my spaces better to work in. So, yes, that is what today holds.  I will let you know how the pantry redeaux goes."},
{"title": "Revisiting the Past -- Cross Stitch", "date": "Tuesday, February 14, 2017", "text": "My husband has always been interested in woodworking.  He has built furniture and play equipment, toys and useful household items.  When we moved to this house and he finally had space for a very small shop, he decided that he would move away from large projects like furniture and concentrate on small projects like toy tops.I feel the same way about my hobbies and activities.  I am no longer interested in making large quilts or trying to do anything large scale.  My house won't accommodate it and I find it a lot less enjoyable if I have to struggle with something. However, in my last post I mentioned being drawn to all things artistic and that includes needlework.  I have always loved handwork and I honestly think that my interest in quilting started waning when I started doing it on the machine and not by hand.  However, my hands are a tiny bit arthritic and so I don't enjoy quilting by hand anymore but cross stitch and embroidery is still do-able.So, anyway, I decided that I needed to find a diversion from Facebook (amazing what a time sucker and negative influence that little space in the interwebs can be) so I have been upping my reading time and have now decided that I should spend some time revisiting needlework.However, like my husband, I have decided to start small.  I have a lot of unfinished things so I went through them and picked out a couple of small things to get busy finishing.  I have a piece started that is a lovely bird but it is large and very involved so I am waiting until I whittle down my stack of unfinished starts. So, this is what I pulled out of the rather large milk-crate I have all this stored in. this kit was a gift from my daughter -- a souvenir of their vacation in Boston -- it is the Old North Church -- it was a quick finish and I really enjoyed doing it.This is a card kit that I had finished about half way.  The count of the fabric is small so it is taking me a little more time but it is quite lovely.  I think cross stitching cards is really fun and a good use for the stitcheryThis little kit was purchased for me from the Alamo gift shop on a trip there almost four years ago.  I started it but I was ill and just didn't have the energy.  However, I am well now and have the energy and will be finishing it quickly.  Framed and coupled with the Old North Church should be a couple little grouping someplace in the house.So, anyway, that is what I am working on instead of scrolling through FB all day.  With the exception of connecting with family and good friends, it is a huge waste of time and is ridiculously addictive -- like sugar. I will be back soon with some finishes here -- can't wait to finish the little Alamo!"},
{"title": "Art, Music and Change", "date": "Monday, February 13, 2017", "text": "Change -- it happens, get over it, nothing ever stays the same -- or does it?  They say that after you have a major life event -- surgery, near death experience, life threatening illness -- you change.  I have seen it happen with family members and I am now realizing that it has happened to me as well.  I knew things were changing but I didn't know what to credit this change to -- now I think I do.Whatever the reason, over the last couple of years I have seen a huge change in my personality and I really rather like it.  How have I changed, you might ask?  Well, I wish there were words but I guess I would say my attitudes and priorities have changed.  The result?  A calmer, more serene me.  I say yes when I can, have no problem saying no when I can't -- or don't want to.  I finally learned what it means to put myself first because if I don't keep myself together, I can't be of any help to anybody else.  It is like an epiphany. Experiencing the joy of gratitude is a life changing event.The biggest change I see in myself, however, is my interests. Once an avid quilter and cross stitcher, I no longer find joy in those pursuits although I am considering a cross stitch project to keep me off the computer, more specifically Facebook.  It seems that now I am totally mesmerized by music and art.My father was an artist and my children are artistic but the gene completely skipped me.  Can't draw a straight line with a ruler.  Or can I?  Does it matter?  What is art?  To me, art is anything drawn, painted, sculpted, sewn or designed that brings joy or awe,  question or discussion.  The effect that color has on a being is amazing to me -- or the lack of color.  Maybe I can't explain it but I do know that right now anything \"art\" has my full attention.\"Art\" is also words to me.  I was introduced to a poem recently -- The Carousel by Rilke --one my daughter learned in high school German class.  It had great meaning to her. Of course, I didn't understand the meaning she gleaned from it but after a discussion I \"got\" it.  My meaning is different than hers, I am sure but it is a deep and thoughtful poem with great symbolism and romantic images.  Here is a link for you to visit:  http://yearwithrilke.blogspot.com/2011/08/carousel-i_20.htmlMy father's art can be seen here:  http://charltonlibrary.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-painted-covers-of-pat-boyette.html and and example here:Yes, they are comic books but my father was well known for his painted covers -- they were paintings rather than just colored illustrations.  I chose Robin Red because it has special meaning -- Robin Red was my son and Maid Mandy was my dog.  The little girl in the story was my daughter.  Let's just say Robin Red and the Lutins was a family affair. My father was a prolific writer and he could create art from his mind, not an example to follow.  He was quiet in the art world but is now, seventeen years after his death, coming to notoriety.  Isn't that always the way?I love fine art as well but I love book illustrations -- my very favorite illustrator being Garth Williams.  He is well known for his illustrations in the Little House books, Stuart Little and scores of Little Golden books.  Tasha Tudor is a close second.Oh, to be able to draw like that! What a gift!And music. Being a child of the  60's I grew up in one of the most fantastic musical eras's of our time.  I mean, seriously, how could you not be impacted by the Beatles, the Beach Boys and Motown.  And, if you liked to dance, like you know I did, it would just shake you to your core.  My favorite song of the time was \"In My Life\" by the Beatles.Today, however, I am more moved by the Nanci Griffiths and Leonard Cohen's of the world -- totally fascinated by Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\" right now.  Is it religious?  Secular?  I guess it just depends on your take and your position but it is meaningful and thought provoking, nonetheless.Art and music-- they both imitate real life yet they can take you away from real life.  They can ground you and they can make you fly and ponder and think.  They can make you feel alive and feed your brain.So, I think I will go color in my color book but I will leave you with this video.  If you think music doesn't have an impact on you, let me tell you that this song brings tears to the eyes of my 6 year old granddaughter and when I watch her, through those tears, I see the true meaning of everything.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBVFvtM9SzM"},
{"title": "Summers at Blue Lake by Jill Althouse-Wood", "date": "Friday, February 10, 2017", "text": "I read a lot of books on my e-reader.  I really don't like it because I prefer physical books but I really love it because it is small, lightweight, and I can read in the car really well with it, even at night.  I am in the car a LOT.  Now, just in case you are wondering, I don't read while I am driving.  I do, however, read when I am a passenger.I have quite a few books on my e-reader so I decided that to start out my 2017 reading list (no challenges this year) I would begin by trying to read down some of my books that are electronic.  I began at the top of the list.  I have them arranged alphabetically by author.  So, the next on the list was this title -- \"Summers at Blue Lake\" by Jill Althouse-Wood.When I opened this book, I sort of felt that it was just an exercise to mark books off a list, clean house so to speak, get it done and archive the book.  I had no idea that this story would grab me hook, line, and sinker.  Finally a book that didn't involve political statements or opinions, marches, rallies, extreme social issues.  This was just a romance.  I loved it.Now, like a lot of books written these days, there is the primary story and a back story.  In this case, the primary story was pretty predictable.  It was the back story that was the grabber. This is the story of Barbara Jean aka Bobbi aka BJ -- depending on what time of her life you are looking at.  BJ is in a really bad marriage -- a marriage of inconvenience where she is the inconvenience.  It is dissolving all around her.  She is the mother of Sam, her five year old son - the product of the inconvenient marriage.  She is an artist specializing in jewelery and metal works.   The book takes you through the summers she spent with her grandmothers in Pennsylvania.  BJ grows up, has romances, has disappointments and victories during this time.The real story, though, is that of her grandmothers.  Now, normally you would think that means her mother's mother and her father's mother.  Not so, in this case.  Her grandmothers were lesbians.  They weren't always lesbians, they both had completely different lives at one point and that is where the twist comes in. I won't say anymore because you just have to read it.  It is well written and flows nicely and actually, it was a page turner for me.  It is medium sized book, 298 pages on my Nook, and I read it in two days.  I couldn't put it down which means the floor didn't get vacuumed.  Oh well, it hasn't gone anywhere.I will say that the interpersonal relationships between BJ and her friend Karen, her husband Bryce, her long-time love Travis and, of course, the grandmothers were handled very tastefully.  There is no explicit detail of the relationship between the grandmothers.  Everything is pretty much \"assumed\".  The tension between BJ and Travis is a little more detailed but not offensive in any way.I recommend this book, it was a great read.  The twist was unexpected, actually, and brought a lot of depth to the characters.  Yes, I enjoyed it."},
{"title": "And Then There was Butter!", "date": "Monday, February 06, 2017", "text": "Awhile back I blogged about making butter using my stand mixer.  It was fun and I wanted to make butter on a regular basis.  Clearly I got distracted because I never made any more.Well, the other day while looking for a few kitchen items at Bed Bath and Beyond I ran across this little goody.  A little butter churn!  Isn't it cute?Yes, I thought so, too.  It is by Kilner, a leading UK brand of canning  jars.  It is well made, easy to use and easy to clean. Here I am pouring the pint of cream into the jar-- it would have held more but I decided to go slow.  The instructions say to leave the cream out for 2 hours to come to room temperature.  The instructions said that by leaving the cream out, it would only take 10 minutes to churn the butter.  I left the cream out for the 2 hours and set about churning.  The instructions were wrong.  It took about 15 minutes for the solids to begin separating from the butter milk but it finally did and this is what it looked like.At this point I poured the buttermilk off, put the solids into a bowl of ice water and washed it -- twice.  Then I squeezed the water out of the butter as in the picture below. After I felt I had all the water out I shaped it into a rectangular shape and added some salt and there you go!And here is the buttermilk that came off the butter -- it will be used for scones tomorrow!My review of the little churn is good -- I liked it.  It was harder than you might think, my arm got tired and my husband had to help but we got some nice butter and I will definitely be doing it again. Today I finished a novel by Susan Gabriel titled \"Trueluck Summer\".  The synopsis caught my attention because it described an adventure involving a 12 year old Trudy Trueluck and her 70 year old grandmother, Ida.  It sounded like it could be comical or poignant or whimsical.However, it was historical fiction taking place during the civil rights movement, specifically 1964. It was engaging and a quick read.  It flowed well and I enjoyed the characterization and the setting.  However, again, maybe not the right time for me because it was all wrapped up in the political and social unrest of the time.  I lived through that unrest so it wasn't particularly entertaining from that aspect.I would recommend the book, it was good, funny, had a good ending -- it was a bit \"To Kill a Mockingbird--esque\".  However, one thing that I realized reading this book is the same thing that I realized reading the last book I read and reviewed -- not much has changed in our society.

{"title": "I Am So Confused!", "date": "Thursday, February 02, 2017", "text": "I like to read magazines and blogs.  I clearly have a problem with magazines, an intervention might be necessary.  I have too many and hang on to them for so long.  I don't care for fashion magazines too much because I am not particularly fashionable but I do enjoy home magazines and regional magazines. I enjoy reading about home decor and lifestyle trends -- always much more \"with it\" than my own decor and lifestyle, to be sure.Last year one of the popular trends was called Hygge.  It is a concept of Danish lifestyle that really has no definition.  A loose translation would be \"cozy\" and all the things that go into making a space cozy during a long, hard, winter.  Hot cocoa and candles seems to be at the forefront of this concept along with knitted items.  Things that we would find cozy as well. Well, maybe not in Texas.No sooner do I get interested in \"hygge\" do I learn that hygge is out and \"lagom\" is in.  Lagom is a a Swedish word meaning \"just right, just enough\".  Now that is something I can get my head around.  Just enough.  I like that and it is actually something that I have been striving for myself.  Not one to really embrace excess, this concept seemed to speak to me.For the last couple of years we have been hearing a lot about \"minimalism\" thanks to Joshua Becker and Marie Kondo.  I sit and look at the photos in Dwell Magazine wishing my home could look like those in this publication.  Sleek, clean, bright, airy, NO CLUTTER -- yes, how soothing and relaxing that would be.  So, just as I start decluttering and packing things away to create a minimal space along comes an article discussing the newest trend -- maximalism.  Yes, it is what you think it is -- excess.Now, just as minimalism is defined by sleek, clean, white/chrome areas, maximalism is defined by over-the-top large scale wallpaper, bright colors, dark colors, lots of furniture and art items.  Lots of -- everything.Ok, so by this time I am really confused.  How many candles are too many?  Not enough?  Just enough?  How many knitted items do I need -- or do I not need any?  I am pretty sure large scale print wall paper isn't going up on ANY wall in Maison Brinkley.  Been there, done that and swore never again.So, I have decided to embrace what I call \"Melissaism\".  What is that you might ask?  Well, let me tell you.  When Hubs and I were first married we bought a houseful of Early American furniture.  Then we fell heir to some of my mother's EA furniture.  I still have a good deal of it.  Then we went through a modern stage and Hubs actually built several things which I still have.  Then came ShabbyChic -- yes, yes, still here.  We decided to get rid of the EA bedroom furniture and buy a brand new bedroom suite because we had never had a brand new one before - it is like British Country Home.  In order to blend all the different sorts of things --and multiple bookcases -- we have added some black painted pieces.  So, you can see where I am going with this.Melissaism -- the melding of 44 years of marriage, three moves, two children and changing tastes all rolled into one not-very-big house.  Is it minimal?  Uh, no.  It is maximal-- not really.  Does it look like a room out of a furniture store -- which store?  which decade? -- no.  Does it look comfy?  Yep.  Does it feel comfy?  Yes, except for the evil sofa in the den.  Would I change it?  Nope -- well, except for the evil sofa in the den. So, I guess I will continue to look at the magazines and blogs and such and enjoy all the trends but know that I will only be comfortable with Melissaism."},
{"title": "Victory Garden by Meredith Allard", "date": "Wednesday, February 01, 2017", "text": "\"Victory Garden\" by Meredith Allard is a novel about Rose Scofield and Adam Bell.  It is also a story about the women's suffrage movement of 1917-1918.  The story shares some of Rose's youth, the fact that her mother passed away when Rose was 2 and that Rose was a school teacher.  She was also a free thinker and a stubborn \"impudent\" sort of girl.Rose's father was a writer for the newspaper, it is assumed the New York Times.  He wrote an article about the Bell Brothers, a really good vaudeville act.  Through her father, Rose met Adam.Because Rose was a supporter of the suffrage movement, she lost her job as a teacher.  She joined the movement, went to Washington D.C., found herself in jail and eventually found her way back home. And Adam?  Well, you will just have to read it to find out.I didn't particularly enjoy this book.  It was a good read but the majority of the book was devoted to protests, marches, World War I and politics.  That makes sense since that was the basic theme but with the atmosphere around our own political situation right now, I wishI had been reading a book to escape all the politics, not throw me right in the middle of it. In spite of it, though, it was a good read and I recommend."},
{"title": "Glitch", "date": "Tuesday, January 31, 2017", "text": "When I posted earlier about no comments on my blog, it was brought to my attention by a friend that she was commenting but I was not getting them, couldn't see them and couldn't find them.  As I looked around, I learned that the problem seemed to be with Google+.  I have since done away with Google+ and now have a comment.  So glad to be able to see comments again although the previous ones have been lost forever.  The last comment I received was in late November.  So, we shall see how it goes -- I certainly don't want to go back to Wordpress -- too difficult.I have been at this blogging business for quite sometime.  I never had a \"theme\", it was more eclectic -- whatever was going on in my head.  I have noticed that I am not gaining readers which is fine, it is mostly just for my fun anyway, but people are stopping by to visit but not leaving any comments.If you stop by to visit I would like to know you have been here so if you could just leave a short comment it would be greatly appreciated.I have been thinking about whether the blog should have a theme, like reading or needlework but I don't think that would work for me particularly.  I have a wide range of interests and don't really care to have multiple blogs.   I have also considered whether it should go on at all.  It is a consideration.At any rate, if you stop by, please leave a comment so I know you have been here.  That is primarily how I found blogs to read for myself!"},
{"title": "Happy Monday!", "date": "Monday, January 30, 2017", "text": "It is a glorious Monday here at Maison Brinkley.  It is spring-like outside -- lots of sun and warmth.  More importantly -- less pollen.  That is a good thing.It was a busy weekend.  I have been working on a project for my eldest granddaughter.  She has to dress up as Betsy Ross for school this week and needed a costume.  I have an \"angel\" costume that I use for virtually anything -- angel, witch, pirate or....Betsy.  So, here is the finished product -- well, except for the hem.  That remains to be done.  Oh yes, meet Ruby, my little red vacuum cleaner.I gathered up all the books on my current TBR list and took a photo.  Here there are.And yesterday, we did this. It was a very busy weekend.  I got a little tired.  I also got sunburned and while the pollen count is lower I have still been bothered.  Blah.So, now I am off to make my homemade laundry detergent.  Then I can tackle the mound of laundry that has piled up while I have been having other fun!"},

{"title": "Ok, Maybe I Do Have Something to Say", "date": "Thursday, January 19, 2017", "text": "I don't like grocery shopping under the best of circumstances.  I certainly don't like it when I am sick with allergies and the pollen count is really high.  I don't want to leave the house.  So, I have been exploring grocery delivery services this morning.I really needed to grocery shop this morning.  The Mr. and I talked about it last night.  He accompanies me everywhere I go because.....well, he is retired and has nothing better to do.  I said we needed to go early to get it done as I really feel like rubbish.It is 11 a.m. and we haven't move -- an inch.  No groceries bought.  Waiting for a phone call that may or may not ever come.I am annoyed.  So, I started exploring delivery options.I found Instacart which delivers from all but one of the stores I shop at.  They will deliver in just a couple of hours.  It isn't an outrageous delivery fee if you buy over $35 worth of products.  Who doesn't spend that every time they walk into the store.  Seems like a non-issue to me. I told my husband I was going to have the groceries delivered.  He laughed at me and said we would go tonight.  I don't want to go tonight.  I don't feel well, I want to go to bed.  I guess I could make him a list and let him go but since that hasn't happened in years I am pretty sure that isn't even on his radar.I wonder if he is going to find it so hysterical when there is no dinner.Yes, I know, I should have just taken myself to the store and ignored him.  I have done it before!My question is -- thoughts on grocery delivery?It seems I have nothing to say today.  I am still sick -- have been this way for a week.  Not happy and I can't taste anything.  So, I thought I would share a couple of photos I took a few days ago.  Probably shouldn't have been outside in the cedar pollen to take them but here they are.A gorgeous Texas sunset --It was really pink and orange -- you can't really see the intensity here but it was beautiful."},
{"title": "What it Means to be Texan", "date": "Wednesday, January 18, 2017", "text": "I am a Texan.  I have lived here my entire life.  People are correct when they say it is like a different world.  Texas has it's own culture, sort of it's own language, it's own style.  Texas has lots of things. I have always been proud to be Texan, felt I lived a different life than most Americans (I didn't but that is how it felt), I love it, would never leave it except under duress but I have to say that sometimes it is hard to be a Texan. Why? Read on.From the Texas State Handbook online we learn this:TEXAS, ORIGIN OF NAME. The word texas (tejas, tayshas, texias, thecas?, techan, teysas, techas?) had wide usage among the Indians of East Texas even before the coming of the Spanish, whose various transcriptions and interpretations gave rise to many theories about the meaning. The usual meaning was \"friends,\" although the Hasinais applied the word to many groups-including Caddoan-to mean \"allies.\"This is true, we are a friendly bunch.  We wave a lot, bless peoples hearts a lot, if you go out to the country the farmers still wave at you as you drive down the highway and in the little towns, people still stop, pull over and take off their hats for a funeral procession.  Sometimes, though, it is just hard to feel that \"perky\" all the time!We have a style from Texas Tacky decor to big hair  to giant homecoming mums (I really don't get that one).these are very commonly found on houses or patiosAny small town gift shop or antique store will have theseBig Texas Hair -- my daughter does it SO wellBig Texas Mum(All of these photos were taken from a google search.  I hope I haven't made anybody mad.) It is hard to be a Texas gal when you can't get your hair big! Bad hair and humidity make it almost impossible for me to achieve this iconic look.  My daughter, however, has it nailed but then she has enough hair for three or four peopleAnd, we have a language all our own -- such as -- 'Aw, the poor little thing tumped over his bowl of grits -- bless his little heart.  Y'all we'll  just give him a coca-cola to cheer him up'. Yep, that is pure Tex-ese and while it sounds like it should come out of somebody from the country it is \"big city\" too.  I never lived in the country, I hailed from the big city and this is how I talk.  I just love the word \"tump\".  The hard part about it?  Well, if we are talking in our own circles it is fine -- we don't even notice but let somebody from, say, Pennsylvania listen to us and they laugh at us.  Yes, laugh.  I had a cousin ask me who taught me to talk because I didn't pronounce \"ambulance\" the \"right\"\" way. Hmmmmp.So, living here is like a down home, friendly, country all around sort or existence-- there is so much to love. But there are some negatives as well.We have lots of poisonous snakes -- like rattlesnakes. We have coons, possum, fox, coyotes, alligators, rabbits -- ok,  the rabbits are ok --  and mockingbirds -- the state bird -- they make lots of noise.We have really weird weather -- floods, twisters, well, that is mostly it except for the fact that it is spring right now in January.  But, that is ok, it IS Texas -- like that explains/excuses everything.Flooding at Ft. HoodThis one was right here in Ft. WorthSo, with all this good, bad, and terrifying stuff about Texas there is one thing that is just the most miserable, deplorable thing EVER!It is Mountain Cedar coming out of the Hill Country and blowing up here to make us all miserable.pollen blowing off a cedar tree in the Texas Hill countryA pollen explosion outside of Austin, TXthis visual just terrifies meinnocent looking isn't it? ha! don't be fooledSo, if there was anything I would change about Texas this would be it.  I wouldn't do away with our corny, countrified ways or our unique style but I would obliterate these dang nasty bushes from the entire planet.I was always sick as a child with \"colds\" -- stopped up ears to the point of complete deafness, general malaise, just miserable like I have been since last Thursday.  We had one of these monster trees right outside my bedroom window.  We slept with the windows open.  I am suprised I am not dead.So, if  you are thinking about coming to visit Texas there is a lot to consider.  If you want to go to the coast to see the Gulf of Mexico and the beaches, or maybe out west to the Davis Mountains and Marfa to see the Marfa lights go right ahead.  Or maybe up here to Dallas to see  the giant metropolis that is Dallas with all it has to offer -- a veritable \"little New York\" or San Antonio with it's rich German history and it's warm Mexican heritage -- not to mention the wonderful, warm Mexican food!  Go ahead, plan away -- you can find almost anything here but whatever you do --Don't come between December and March -- the cedar will get you and not let you go -- it will forever ruin what could be a beautiful memory.  So...just sayin -- October and November are real nice."},

{"title": "Our World Tuesday", "date": "Monday, January 16, 2017", "text": "Our World Tuesday is a meme to give a snapshot of our daily life. I don't know if I should be participating because that is sort of the normal theme of my blog but I will give it a go.Our World, January 16, 2016The weather has been very strange this winter on the whole but yesterday we had some dangerously severe thunderstorms.  It wasn't cold and it felt more like spring.  Today was beautiful and the pollen count was very low which was wonderful but I am already sick with \"cedar fever\" which is what we call how you feel when you get attacked by the cedar/juniper pollen that thrives in Texas.The weather was so nice today that my husband decided to change the oil in the car. Of course, once a tinkerer, always a tinkerer so he pulled some wires, put them back and voila! the car wouldn't start.We now have a new car battery.  We noticed that it was slow to start on one of our colder days.  Glad he got that done before we got stuck someplace. And me?  I have sneezed all day.  All. Day.  A low fever -- very low.  Aching face/teeth. Scratchy sore throat and ..... sneezing.That is what is going on in our little world today, 16 January 2016.We are well into the new year now.  Resolutions have been made and broken.  Diets have begun and failed.  To Do lists have been made and ripped to shreds.  I think the better thing to do is reflect -- on the LAST year.Last year for me seemed to be a rather hectic thing.  I had lots of things I wanted to do, got very few of them done, was truly unorganized which showed at the holidays and I just generally think I failed at 2016.  That realization has given me pause for reflection.Reading my cousin's recent blog entry (mlhalldotcom.blogspot.com) made me think about how I would like 2017 to go.  A little better than 2016 I would say.  He talks about not getting caught up in extraneous events and happenings but being more in the moment with things that are more personal.  I like what he says and I agree with his approach.In the past year I have tried to live my life between doctor's appointments.  Stupid, I know.  It is like, ok, I just had a positive doctor visit so let's see how much living I can get done in the next four months before the NEXT visit.  Of course, the month before the NEXT visit is always fraught with anxiety so that is a waste of precious \"ok\" time.  I seem to judge time as \"ok for now\" time until the next time.  Really annoying so I am trying to get past that.  That sort of thinking is SO counterproductive and I waste so much time determining if I am ok or not ok so I can plan how to live and what to prioritize.  Really not good.This was the year of our latest election and what an election it was.  It was the most mean spirited, back-biting, lying, accusing, disgusting time I have ever seen.  I guess elections can do that to people.  The problem is, people are still doing it! It is like everybody is still in campaign mode!  People, it is over.  Let it go (breaks into song here).  Eight years ago I didn't vote for Obama, I voted for Romney.  I didn't like either of them, I determined my vote based on who made me the least nervous.  Romney didn't win but I didn't go out acting the fool and being obnoxious to people with name calling and be being assinine.  This election I voted for Donald Trump.  Again, I voted for who made the least nervous.  I actually think I voted for Mike Pence.  The point is we all do the best we can under the circumstances, make the best decisions we can based on our concerns and go with it.  In eight years it will be over and we can judge then whether it was good, bad, or ugly.  The one thing I have learned through all this is that you don't really know people until you tangle with them politically.  I have had people that I thought were friends be so degrading and hateful that I no longer communicate with them.  That is sad.  So, the lesson I learned is.......don't talk about politics.  Make your choice, change  your mind, talk to yourself but whatever you do, don't talk to anybody else! Or, maybe you should -- good way to see people as they truly are.I have also come to understand how I want to spend my time.  I have always been involved in several hobbies -- mostly needlework of some sort.  I used to enjoy it.  I don't really anymore.  I tried to keep doing it anyway because I thought I \"should\".  Yep -- not gonna do that anymore.  I have decided I don't like any hobbies that make a mess or cause me physical pain.  So, I will be coloring.  A lot.  And reading.  And maybe drawing -- something I have become quite interested in the last few months.  I have also considered taking up painting -- not sure if that is doable but  you know, I can dream.So, my take on 2017 is going to be like mlhall's -- the year of me.  That sounds selfish but it isn't . I am going to take this year to learn more about \"me\", to sort out what is really \"me\", to explore some sides of \"me\" that have been left unexplored.  Maybe I will try my hand at writing again -- or get deeper into my family history (don't understand DNA at all, BTW).   For certain I am going to be a more regular blogger even though nobody reads it or at least nobody comments. So, here's to the year of \"me\" -- discovering who I am and what I am supposed to be doing at this point in my journey.  Hopefully 2017 will be a kinder, gentler year."},
{"title": "Angels in my Hair by Lorna Byrne", "date": "Sunday, January 15, 2017", "text": "A while back I caught Lorna Byrne on a television program and decided to check out her book \"Angels in my Hair\".  Lorna Byrne is a modern day Irish mystic who claims she can see and talk to angels...not just her angels but everybody's angels.I believe in angels because they are spoken of in the Bible.  I believe in Jesus and accept him as my Lord and saviour and I believe in God as the creator of everything.  Because of my beliefs I had no problem believing in the angels that Byrne speaks of.  I am not sure of her ability to have such a relationship with angels, however.  It is very interesting, though, to read her accounts of knowing angels since she was a baby.  Her descriptions are beautiful.  She seems to be a very gentle person and not the sort to deceive.The one thing that I noticed, though, is that as I read I found myself wanting to know my angel's name and to feel my angel's touch.  Yes, I believe we all have a guardian angel and if Byrne is correct, we have angels all around us all the time.  I found myself curious and desiring the same sort of relationship she claims to have.  It was all very beautiful.  I also have found myself thinking I would like to speak to Byrne myself. Do I recommend this book?  Yes.  If you are a spiritual person it will only strengthen your faith. If you aren't, it might change something.  If nothing else it opens up a whole new conversation.Unconscious Mutterings  Free association is described as a \"psychonanalytic procedure in which a person is encouraged to give free rein to his or her thoughts and feelings, verbalizing whatever comes into the mind without monitoring its content.\" Over time, this technique is supposed to help bring forth repressed thoughts and feelings that the person can then work through to gain a  better sense of self.That's an admirable goal, but for the purposes of this excercise, we're just hoping to have a little fun with the technique.

{"title": "Vintage Photos of San Antonio, Texas", "date": "Saturday, January 14, 2017", "text": "I grew up in San Antonio, Texas.  I was always aware that we lived in a very historic place -- who hasn't heard of the Alamo?  I always loved the old architecture.  We lived relatively close to downtown and while the neighborhood we lived in was \"new\" -- circa 1948 -- many of the buildings were quite old.  I loved the vintage feel of all of it.There is a site on Facebook that is dedicated to photos of vintage San Antonio.  I thought it might be nice to share some of old photos here.  Some of the photos are of really old buildings, some are places that I spent time at as a child.  There isn't much rhyme or reason to my selection, just whatever speaks to me at the moment.  I won't show them all here today but spread them out over several posts.  It could be an ongoing project as people are always finding \"new\" old photos.This first one is going to be of Firehouse No. 7 at 604 South Alamo.This building was built in 1924 and was the third structure to be on this piece of property.  It began in 1885 as a volunteer unit.  It is said to be haunted with the spirits of former firefighters.I used to work at the San Antonio Independent School District which is right behind this fire station.  We would walk across the parking lot, through the fire station, wave at the firemen, cross the street and walk a half a block to  our favorite Mexican food restaurant, El Mirador.This is what it looks like today.  It was for sale in October.  $150 square foot.  5300+ square feet.  What a fantastic house that would make. I could even go get my old job back and walk to work!  Well, ok, maybe not. Anyway, just a little bit of SA history! More to come!"},
{"title": "Header Photo", "date": "Friday, January 13, 2017", "text": "In case you are wondering about the layout of my blog, I have been playing again! I love to arrange and design these things even though I am not terribly creative.  The current photo is inappropriately Christmas themed.  We already did Christmas, didn't we?  I think so. Anyway, during the Christmas season many vintage photos of San Antonio, Texas were posted on a facebook page devoted to San Antonio memories.  Since San Antonio is my home town I decided to save a few of the photos and this is one.  I remember Christmas in downtown so well -- this was taken in the 40's -- before my time -- but it hadn't changed much when I was a child.  I remember all these stores and the decorations that spanned the streets.  It was a magical time!So, since it is still January, technically winter although hard to tell here in DFW with the 70-80 degree days we have been having, I thought I would share for a few days.  It won't last long, though, because I love to change these things around!Again, this is a meme I used to participate in but have let go for some reason.  I decided to pick it up again today.  If you would like to join in you can find the rules at RoseCityReader.com.  The idea is to post the first one or two sentences from  your current read and then link back to the website.I am currently reading \"Angels in my Hair\" by Lorna Byrne, a modern day Irish mystic that claims to be able to see angels.  I saw her on a television program and decided to explore her book which is autobiographical.  It is a good read, interesting, funny in parts, questionable but thought provoking.  I would recommend.Here are my first sentences --\"When I was two years old the doctor told my mother I was \"retarded.\"  \"When I was a baby, my mother noticed that I always seemed to be in a world of my own.  I can even remember lying in a cot--a big basket--and seeing my mother bending over me.\"So, if you decide to check out Lorna Byrne, there are lots of articles about her.  Interesting lady."},
{"title": "Buh-by Hygge, Hello Lagom!", "date": "Thursday, January 12, 2017", "text": "I am probably really slow on the uptake but in the last several months I have heard a lot about the Danish lifestyle concept known as \"hygge\". \"Hygge\" doesn't really have an English translation but loosely means \"cozy\".  It is a way that the Danes look at life and structure their homelife.  It has to do with the cold, dark weather there and is meant to make it more comfortable and festive.  It involves lots of knitted items, hot cocoa, simple meals with good friends and candles.  It sounds lovely but.....It is Texas, it is January, is is 80 degrees and I am in shorts.  Hard to \"hygge\" under those conditions unless you factor in a comfy lawn chair, some new flip flops and a big iced tea.  That is \"hygge\" in Texas.I do understand the concept though and I like it, it sounds great.However, it seems that \"hygge\" is so 2016!  According to magazines and the internet the next new thing is \"lagom\".\"Lagom\" is a Swedish word meaning \"just the right amount\" or \"just enough\".  It is also a lifestyle concept and it promotes simple living, moderation.Now, that is something I can get my head around.  I have done that all my life! Who knew I was living some exotic, foreign lifestyle!!  Maybe it has to do with all that Scandinavian blood coursing through my veins according to Ancestry.com DNA.  Maybe it came from my mother -- nah, she didn't believe much in moderation as I think back.  I don't know but I do know that I have always lived \"in moderation\".I can't be a minimalist for sure.  I just can't.  I like my \"stuff\" too much.  Now, I don't go out every chance I get and acquire new \"stuff\" and I don't particularly like shopping at all but I can't live with one plate, one towel and one pair of shoes.  My feet hurt too much for just one pair of shoes.I also cannot live with excess.  Right now my kitchen cabinets are giving me grief because they are running over with unnecessary stuff.  I need to purge.  Most of the stuff I didn't buy but rather fell heir to.  Falling heir is not a good thing in a lot of cases.  Anyway, I dont' like having too much --too many plastic storage containers, too many towels, definitely too many magazines.  I can't handle too much.So, it seems that for me, 2017 being the year of \"lagom\" is going to be a good fit! It gives me license to go in and dig out all those casserole dishes that I don't ever use.  It gives me the \"ok\" to throw out all the magazines! Yes, it gives me permission to be myself!Yay 2017 and the year of \"lagom\"!!!"},
{"title": "And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer", "date": "Tuesday, January 10, 2017", "text": "I went to Barnes and Noble even though I said I wasn't going to.  I went to the sale table.  I wasn't going to but I did.  I picked up a couple of titles.  I wasn't supposed to but I did. I went to the new release shelves and a small book caught my eye.  It was titled \"And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer\" by Fredrik Backman.  It was small and short and I knew it would make me cry.  I walked away.I looked a cookbooks, I fawned over the coloring books, I was amazed at how B&N has reduced their ebook section to almost nothing.  I was drawn back to the little book with only 76 pages.I couldn't help myself.It is about Grandpa -- an elderly man living with some form of dementia.  It is about his son Ted, his wife and his grandson Noah. It is sad.  But it isn't sad.  It isn't humorous but it isn't too dire either.  It is written beautifully like all the other Backman titles.  I really haven't read prose like his -- ever.  It seems like the central theme for all his books is death but then they aren't really sad.Would I recommend?  Yes, yes, yes.  It is thought provoking and yes, a tear jerker but it is worth it.Today is my grandfather's birthday.  He was born January 10, 1896 in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  This photo was taken in 1953 at my 3rd birthday party.  It was taken in the backyard of my grandparents home in San Antonio, Texas, right around the corner from our house.  I dearly loved my PaPa and still miss him.Welcome to Teaser Tuesday, the weekly Meme that wants you to add books to your TBR, or just share what you are currently reading.

Everyone loves Teaser Tuesday.For some reason I always want to call this Tuesday Teaser instead of Teaser Tuesday.  Go figure. Ok, my teaser today comes from a novella by Fredrik Backman.  The title is \"And Every Morning the Way Homes Gets Longer and Longer\".  This teaser can be found on page 36.\"Why are you holding my hand so tight, Grandpa?\" the boy whispers again.\"Because all of this is disappearing Noahnoah. And I want to keep hold of you the longest of all\".This novella is only 76 pages long and I am almost finished.  You can read the review here later today."},
{"title": "Christmas Bells by Jennifer Chiaverini", "date": "Monday, January 09, 2017", "text": "Christmas Bells by Jennifer Chiaverini seemed like the perfect holiday read.  It was a slow go but mostly because the holidays didn't allow me much reading time.  As is popular now, it was a story comprised of multiple story lines involving lots of characters but it was primarily about the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow family Christmas and modern day Sophia and Lucas.  The stories become entwined when Sophia choses a carol set to a Longfellow poem for the annual Christmas program.There are several other story lines going on -- Father Ryan and his brother Liam, Camille, Sister Winifred, Charlotte, Alex and their mother, the Civil War -- there was a LOT going on.All of these story lines came together at the end to make sense but for the better part of the book it all seemed scattered and hectic and I didn't think it flowed well.  I was a bit disappointed in this book because Chiaverini's books generally flow well but this one was just more halting and, at times I felt a bit contrived like she was really having to work to make it work.With all that said, however, Jennifer Chiaverini is one of my favorite authors and I will continue to read her works with pleasure.It seems the popular \"thing\" on Facebook these days is posting quotes that are meaningful to you.  I see this done as an expression of faith, a nudge to the posters own sensibility or maybe even a passive aggressive message to a possible reader.  Whatever the reason behind the post, some of these really resonate with me.  One of my friends, a devout Christian, seems to always be posting something that I absolutely need to hear at that very moment. The words that I have quoted seem to express my reality now, three and a half years after my \"medical adventure\".  I know the reasonable, scientific, doctor-speak reason for my adventure but I really feel like it was to get my attention.  There needed to be an attitude adjustment.While there was an abrupt change in my attitude at the time, there has been more of an evolving change as well.  I look at the world completely differently now.  I deal with \"issues\" differently now -- first line of defense is prayer.  I no longer think I can fix anything.  I can do things that I know are healthier (physically and emotionally) for me but in the big scheme of things I have no power except to realize and acknowledge the need for a strong faith, an unceasing prayer life, quiet time and a reason to go on with life. I am working toward all of those things and I feel like a different person.  The most important, life changing thing of all was experiencing the joy that comes from gratitude.  There is no other feeling in the world like it and it is a feeling I have come to crave.  I believe it is a blessing and once you have felt it to the extreme, you know it.So, yes, this above stated quote is like my mission statement.  It is pretty much how I govern my days these days."},
{"title": "The Remains of the Snow starring My Back Garden", "date": "Saturday, January 07, 2017", "text": "They had been predicting snow for several days.  Not a lot of snow, mind you, just a few flurries.  It would begin about rush hour on Friday morning.Friday morning came and went and no snow at Maison Brinkley.  I was keeping my fingers crossed because, while it is very lovely, I don't like snow or ice. About 1:30 we were getting ready to leave to pick up the Bean and we looked out and, lo and behold, what did we see?  Small little flurries punctuated by some really big fluffy snowflakes.  We laughed and said no big deal.It wasn't a big deal except for the one patch of ice we hit but even that wasn't horrible. Thank goodness for four wheel drive vehicles!So, with any luck, winter is over since it is supposed to be in the 70's on Tuesday. I jest because we have been known to have snow in March so we will see.  It is generally a crap shoot here in Texas in regards to the weather.I did record this winter event for posterity and, for the viewing pleasure of my readers from up north,  a good laugh.So, here is our Texas snowfall for January 2017.Snow on the boulder -- there really was more last nightIce in the birdbathThe berries make a wonderful addition to the photo, don't you think?"},
{"title": "Yesterday....", "date": "Friday, January 06, 2017", "text": "Yesterday was quite the day.  Well, in the big scheme of things, not really, but in my little world anything out of the ordinary constitutes excitement.In our house we have a set of unwritten rules.  I get up early.  Hubs doesn't.  The last one out of bed makes it up which means it is never me! I don't turn off the house alarm because it beeps and it might wake him up so that job goes to him as well.Ok, so Hubs is on several meds for diabetes and high blood pressure and cholesterol and all that sort of thing.  Recently, oh say the last year or two, he has been having a \"problem\" in that he has vivid dreams and can't seem to wake himself up out of them.  As a result he seems to do a version of \"sleepwalking\" through them until he wakes up.  He looks like he is awake, he talks like he is awake but he usually is acting out the dream and he has no recollection of what is going on.  Trust me, these are very active occurrences.  It isn't like he is sound asleep and mumbling -- he is on his feet, trying to do things like fold all the bed cover up in a little square, or trying to rearrange things that aren't there.  A couple of nights ago he was wadding the quilt up and holding it up over his head like a sacrifice! Sometimes these things are funny but most times not.  Yesterday was one of those not-so-funny days.I got up as usual.  Came in and had my breakfast and a cuppa when I heard the alarm being turned off.  He didn't get it turned off because it beeps a certain number of times when it turns off and I could hear that didn't happen.  I asked him and he replied \"yes, of course I got it turned off\".  I could tell, with that reply, that he wasn't awake.  Well, before I knew it he had gone out the door into the garage to \"check the meat\" (he was smoking meat in the dream) and, in the process of opening the door, he set the alarm off.  He kept trying to turn it off but was hitting the wrong buttons which sent it into a stupid loop where we COULDN'T get it turned off. The siren blared for at least 10 minutes.  The only thing to do was flip all the breakers on the panel and make it stop which he did.  We could then restore everything to normal.It woke the neighbors up.  They came outside to look and decided there was something wrong with our gas meter.  They couldn't get us on the phone because we couldn't hear it ringing with the siren going off.  So, they called the gas company.  We didn't know any of this was happening.I had just sat down with my cup of tea, trying to calm my nerves when there was a booming knock on the door.  It was the gas man asking about our call.  We didn't make a call.  I sent him next door.  By this time Hubs was waking up and getting dressed to go out and talk to the gas man.  There was nothing wrong with the gas -- no leaks or anything.  Gas man went on his way.Everything finally calmed down into normalcy but as we sat laughing about the hectic morning, Hubs said he had no idea why he went out into the garage to begin with.  He was dreaming that he was smoking meat and that there was a line of people wanting to help baste it and he had to check to make sure it was getting basted and he assumed, in the dream, that the meat was in the garage. All that and no real meat to show for it.  If he is going to have these ridiculous dreams, I wish there was at least something to show for it other than my frazzled nerves.Is this funny?  Sometimes.  Sometimes not.  Do I think it is serious?  Oh yes.  Am I going to have to intervene and talk to the doctor.  Probably.  Yuck. New rules -- I turn off the alarm when I get up whether it wakes him up or not.  I did that this morning.  He is still asleep.  Clearly not a problem."},
{"title": "Consistency", "date": "Wednesday, January 04, 2017", "text": "My goodness, it is already the first hump day of the new year! And a cold one it is.  We have been spoiled by lovely spring temps but we are paying our dues now for the next few days.  Friday might bring some light snow flurries.  If they are light and no ice is involved, I could enjoy that.  IF.I don't like to make new year resolutions because I am always a bit over zealous, a bit too detailed and fussy and I am always trying to change things that clearly aren't meant to be changed.  Some of my resolutions would absolutely require a personality overhaul which, we all know, isn't likely to happen. However, since last spring I have been working on a list of things I would like to change about my habits and our life here in Maison Brinkley.  As I have posted earlier, I had a list of things that I had to do before the end of the year and I managed to get most of them done but not without a good bit of anxiety and sandwiching between other things.  I am starting out the year feeling accomplished but I don't want to lean on my laurels -- one of my biggest downfalls.  I was always like that and it isn't good.  As Dory would say, \"just keep swimming\".So, I am making small changes to my personal habits to make things happen on a more even keel.  From what I understand, it takes 28 days to form a new habit and, by my observation, about 20 seconds to break it so my goal is to work hard to try not to break them.One goal is to make my dentist very happy.  We all brush and floss our teeth -- or at least I hope we do.  However, some of us are more prone to dental distress than others -- it seems to be an inherited thing in my family -- so I have had to ramp up my dental habits somewhat.  My dentist is going to be pleased to hear that I am flossing after each meal as well as brushing.  Now, the brushing was always a given but the flossing after EACH meal is new to me.  I realize that is too much information but it is a good example of how a small habit can be formed -- I have been doing this now for a couple of months and I can't imagine not doing it -- I don't feel right when I don't.  I am hoping this new habit will yield results he will be happy with.  I will let you know.Another bad habit I am hoping to break is waiting until 3:30 to figure out what is for dinner.  It will more than likely be something that has to be defrosted which immediately means dinner out.  That is a habit that was so easy to form and one that needs to be broken without a doubt.  So, today I am planning to start dinner quite early, make use of the crockpot and hopefully have a lovely roast for dinner tonight.  I started planning this last night so I can be more effective today.  I guess a good title for this would be \"planning ahead\". One more habit that I am currently forming is mopping my kitchen every night.  I have an open floor plan with lots and lots of tile floor but I don't intend to mop the entire house every night -- just the kitchen area.  It is a galley style and not all that huge so it really shouldn't be an issue.  I bought a Bona floor care system with the spray bottle of cleaner.  It works really well -- no big buckets of mop water and it doesn't feel sticky afterward.  So, how much work could it be to do a little spritz and swish over the floor at the end of the day.  I would think it would be quite do-able so I am going to do it! And another habit that I want to form is reading at least 30 minutes a day.  I am not joining any challenges this year but I did see one that is 52 books a year -- one a week.  I think that would be great but some books might take longer than a week and some maybe could be done in a day or two.  My goal, I think is to just real a little everyday -- consistency is important in anything you do.In fact, I think consistency should be my overall goal for the year -- being consistent with everything.  Don't try to be perfect just be consistent.  So, that is my buzzword for 2017 -- Consistency! Just Keep Swimming!"},

It seems much more vibrant after the rain last nightthe blue porch ceilingI can attest to the fact that yellow jackets and wasps do NOT like the blue ceiling.  We took down  the ceiling fan on the patio which, much to our dismay, had become a big nest for wasps and mud daubers and decided to just replace it with a light.  A couple of the wasps came back looking for their now defunct home and they kept trying to fly up and hit the ceiling and came right back down which means they actually do think it is the sky.  They finally left and I haven't seen them since. I love blue, it is one of my favorite colors and I love incorporating it into my decor.  It is generally the color that I wear the most as well.  I very pleased with the way the back of the house looks with the new paint and the new roof.  I think we should go to the nursery today and buy some pansies to plant in those blue pots!What do you think?"},
{"title": "Happy New Year!", "date": "Sunday, January 01, 2017", "text": "Happy New Year! It seems that 2016 was a challenge, in some way, to almost everybody.  Everywhere I go I hear people commenting on what a rough year it was.  I am included in that group.  From September until yesterday, our life was so incredibly busy -- and expensive -- that it is hard to get our heads around it.In September my MIL fell and broke her hip, had surgery, had a heart attack as a result of the surgery and spent a large amount of time in rehab.  After the heart attack  she was treated more as a cardiac patient than a surgical patient and she spent a lot more time in rehab than a usual rehab stint.  She doesn't seem to be having any lasting effects from the heart attack and she is back home from rehab but she didn't get home until mid-November.In the middle of all of that my husband had cataract surgery on both eyes.  It all went very well -- they really have that down to a science.  Very little downtime, very few restrictions.  He can see to drive at night now which is a blessing as we were beginning to live our lives in just the daylight hours.  That is fine except for the times that it isn't.  At any rate he is doing quite well.Then, in the midst of all this health care, we had quite a few things come up with the house.  It was almost like the house was feeling left out of attention and decided to give us some issues.The first thing involved getting a new roof due to the hail storms last spring.  We opted for a dent resistant roof because we tend to have hail and ice and such a LOT here.  In fact, we are supposed to have softball sized hail tonight.  Yay!  Because the whole town apparently needed new roofs we were on the docket for December but, fortunately, we were called in November that they were read to start and we were doing the happy dance.The hail also did a number on the gutters.  The yard cutters do a number on them as well so new gutters were in order, after the roof installation.  The house needed fresh paint so my husband decided to paint the house between the roofing and the guttering.  It is all done now and looks smashing!In the meantime, with all this exterior work going on and all the health caring going on, the washer decided to quit, a ceiling fan remote stopped working and the replacement has been discontinued which required a new ceiling fan and  the hv/ac went out which required a new unit. Now, last spring I made a list of things that I wanted/needed to get done before the end of the year because my goal was to start out the new year with things taken care of (like an adult) and caught up with and just generally being on top of things.  On this list were things like -- get the new crown on the back tooth, get new glasses, have the mammogram and try to work in more exercise -- all before the final doctor appointment for the year on December 30.  Well, as September rolled around and the great Brinkley Collapse happened, all my list got shoved to the end of the page giving precedence to the other stuff.  So, the last two weeks of December found me playing catch up with my own list.  I crammed a lot of stuff in that last two weeks which pretty much put Christmas on the sidelines which was really ok, I guess.  Christmas celebrations aren't what they used to be when we were young and our kids were little but I do find that I am quieter during Advent, more thoughtful and closer to the real meaning of the holiday.  Over the years I have mourned those youthful, kid-filled, noisy, rowdy Christmases but this year I realized there is something deep and meaningful about it being quiet and calm.  The focus is shifted but I am not sure that is a bad thing.So, last night I sat here with the Hubs, quiet, trying to finish a book that I am simply not enjoying, one eye on the football game and I realized that I was calm and peaceful and feeling very accomplished.  I had accomplished a lot in four months even though a lot of it was not of my choosing.  I feel like I am going into 2017 with a clean slate, I feel caught up and like I have a handle on things.  I have a list of things in my mind that I want to commit to habit -- these aren't resolutions -- I don't do resolutions -- they are just habits that I need to tweak to make my life easier and help me not get behind -- staying on top of things so to speak.  I have been working on these changes slowly and will continue to do so.  I am learning, in my old age, that self -discipline is not just for the young -- all of us need to have some self-discipline in order to control the stress and the feeling of being out of control and that being \"retired\" doesn't negate the need for self-discipline. It is a good thing to quote Martha.As I close this first blog of the new year I have to say that I am going into this year with hope and calm and the knowledge that I can't change anything in the world or in anybody else's life but I can change mine and how I do that will have a direct affect on how I deal with the world around me. Oh, and I have to take care of the one thing on my list that didn't get taken care of.  I have to have that new crown made.  So, I will be making that appointment on Tuesday.  No more putting things off for me -- Melissa will be striking while the iron is hot -- nipping things in the bud -- whatever cliche you want to use.  My goal for this year is to stay on top of things and persevere!!Have a wonderful day!"},
{"title": "Happy New Year! and....the ugly truth", "date": "Saturday, December 31, 2016", "text": "Tonight is New Year's Eve.  As a couple the most we have ever done is stay up late, at home, and watch some of the local fireworks.  We are not the party type, we don't drink, and staying up late for no better reason that to watch the clock tick just seems like a big waste of good sleep time to me.  I know, I sound like the New Year's grinch but I am not, I just like to sleep.Tonight we will be doing something different, though.  We will be babysitting three of our four grandchildren.  It should be fun but definitely something that we don't usually do.  Their parents want to stay out past midnight which means a late night for us -- again, something we are not used to.  I am sure I will be passed out on the couch long before the kids are -- that is just how I roll.We won't be spending the night there but rather we will either come home which is a 45 minute drive in the middle of the night with all the drunken crazies out or we will go down the road and spend the night at my daughter's house.  That is probably what is going to happen.Yes, we need to move.So, that is how we are ringing out 2016.  I am ringing in 2017 with a heavy dose of exercise and dieting using My Fitness Pal.  I am still going to be doing my \"normal eating\" approach but I am going to document what I eat so that I can show the doctor who probably doesn't believe me.  I need to exercise because I just sit here on this computer all day.  All. Day.  My first exercise is walking and I will be doing that here in my house.  My floor plan gives me a really good \"track\" to walk a circle through the house and it takes me about 100 steps to make one lap.  I have reactivated my Garmin fitness tracker and am wearing it -- too bad that it irritates my skin. What is precipitating all this?  I had my 4 month dr. appointment yesterday and as far as the cancer goes, all is well.  Apparently my numbers are good, my exam was good and it was thumbs up all around.  However, my blood pressure was off the charts --183/120/90.  I have always had low blood pressure but the medication I am on is known to raise blood pressure and make weight loss nearly impossible.  So, the bp is on the rise and the weight is as well.  I have to do something.  So, since I have already adopted this \"normal eating\" style -- three meals a day, a snack in between and nothing after dinner -- all normal portions -- the only thing left is exercise.  So, exercise it will be.  It is time to nip this in the bud.  I don't think getting off the medicine is an option so exercise is the best line of defense.  I do need to work on getting past \"white coat syndrome\" -- maybe it would help if my dr. didn't wear a white coat! So, wish me luck in the new year.  I am not waiting until tomorrow to start -- I have already started.  I took my bp this morning and it was still high but not THAT high.  I was still a bit anxiety ridden this morning -- I have been having anxiety problems lately which I noted to the doctor but nobody addressed it.  So, I guess I am just going to have to walk or bicycle through it.  I think I can do something about this other than medication, I just need to make the effort.So, I think I will go take a walk."},
{"title": "Goodreads 2016 Challenge", "date": "Friday, December 30, 2016", "text": "Tomorrow is New Year's Eve and the day that I will wind up my 2016 Goodreads Reading Challenge.  Last year I did well reading more books than my goal.  If you look at numbers that is a good thing.  However, I can honestly say that I don't even remember reading some of the books.  That is not such a good thing.  Granted, some of the books are may not be  memorable but seriously, I think I was just reading too fast to really enjoy the process.This year I signed up to read 25 books.  I am not going to make that goal as I have only read 18.  I am currently reading \"Christmas Bells\" by Jennifer Chiaverini and am about half finished.  However, with my schedule for the next two days I seriously doubt that I am going to finish -- and it isn't a long book!So, after giving some thought to the reading challenges I have decided to make my own reading challenge.  It won't be based on the number of books I read during 2017.   It will be based on meaningful reading and reading from my own shelves.  I can't begin to tell you how many books I have unread on my shelves.  I have even stopped going to bookstores for fun because I can't say \"no\" to a book calling my name and I have plenty here to read -- I probably wouldn't have to buy a new book for quite sometime.  When you factor in the number Nook books and Kindle books I have, well, the numbers grow exponentially.With all these things in mind 2017 won't be a year of reading for quantity but rather quality.  I will start on January 1,  I will probably still be reading the Chiaverini book and it will be my first finish.  What is next?  I don't know but I do know that it will come from my personal library -- either a physical book or an e-book. A while back I decided to arrange my books alphabetically by author.  I even left room for new additions -- clever of me, wasn't it?  I am finding it much easier to not duplicate books that way -- something I have been known to do. Now looking at my own personal library is much like going to a bookstore.  I am also learning that not every book that comes into my house has to stay in my house.  I either take advantage of Half Price Books buy back program or I donate to charity.  Sometimes I just pass them on to others.  I only have a certain amount of space and we have several bookcases already along with a book closet so I really don't mind paring down now and again.  Some titles will never leave.That is how I see my reading going for 2017.  I feel like I have been rushing through everything lately and that isn't how I want things to be.  I want to slow down and really enjoy what life has to offer and that includes books.  So, that is my plan!  You can see my accomplishment list here and I will take more time to review the books that I read.  They will be listed on Goodreads as well. Now, to finish this Christmas book and move on -- I see some Dorothea Benton Frank in my immediate future!"},
{"title": "Haint Blue Ceilings of the South", "date": "Thursday, December 29, 2016", "text": "I am from the south but the Texas south -- not the deep American south like South Carolina and Georgia.  I have an accent - or so I have been told - but a Texas accent, not an American southern accent.  However, lots of my ancestors took the usual migration routes across the country from the New England area through the southern states to Texas.  Many of them lived in North Carolina and Alabama so I have an interest in the lifestyles of those areas. Every area has its customs and traditions peculiar unto itself.  Obviously Texas has lots of cultural and historical customs and traditions which are completely ingrained in those of us who have lived here all our lives.  However, many areas have just as interesting and compelling backgrounds and one that I have been fascinated with, since I learned of it, is the blue porch ceilings of South Carolina and Georgia.Many people paint their porch ceiling a shade of blue or blue green referred to as \"haint blue\".  \"Haint\" is the Gullah word for haunt or spirits.  Here is a definition of Gullah from Wikipedia:Gullah (also called Sea Island Creole English and Geechee) is a creole language spoken by the Gullah people (also called \"Geechees\" within the community), an African-American population living on the Sea Islands and in the coastal regions of the American States of South Carolina, GAnd here is an explanation of the painted porch tradition from the Sherwin Williams Paint website: \"Southerners, especially in the area of South Carolina, have a name for the ceiling paint used on porches – the soft blue-green is referred to as \"Haint Blue.\" \"Haints are restless spirits of the dead who, for whatever reason, have not moved on from their physical world,\" says Sawaya.\"Now, I don't much believe in spirits that haven't moved on -- well, I do actually but I don't think any of them are living on my back patio.  However, what does live on my back patio are wasps, yellow jackets and mud daubers.  According to some, the blue ceilings will appear to be the sky to these little varmints and they will not want to build their nests in the corners of your patio or porch.  That was reason enough for me to do this --Since we were painting the house anyway thanks to the installation of the new gutters, I asked my husband to paint the ceiling of the patio blue.  He looked at me a little concerned about my mental well being but I told him the history which didn't make much of an impression but when I told him about deterring wasps and flying things, that shed a whole new light on it and voila! we have a blue ceiling.  It looks a bit washed out here in the early morning light but it is actually a very lovely, light turquoise blue.  It is very spa-like -- beachy actually.  It looks very relaxing from inside the house and I think it is going to be very relaxing during the summer and maybe we won't have so many flying beasts to contend with.  It is hard to maintain a relaxed summer atmosphere when you are armed with Raid to get rid of the wasps and yellow jackets -- we have mostly yellow jackets.So, that is what we have been doing in this wonderful warm winter we are having.  It was 82 yesterday so the painting got finished, the ceiling is blue and we are quite pleased with the way it turned out.What do you think?"},
{"title": "Winding Down the Year --Reading Challenges", "date": "Wednesday, December 28, 2016", "text": "2016 is winding down.  It hasn't been a bad year for me personally but then I am not a celebrity or person of notoriety, thank goodness.  The year was actually pretty devoid of monumental events which is just fine with me.  I have reached the age where average, ordinary, undramatic works well for me. This year I have come to terms with the fact that I have lost interest in a lot of the things I used to love to do and I have figured out why.  Pressure.  I used to love to quilt but lost interest because 1) I couldn't just get creative and play without the pressure of having to make something for somebody else and there was always a deadline and 2) I can't crawl around on the floor to pin them anymore.  I used to love to do needlework like embroidery and cross stitch.  I remember when I was expecting my daughter, I went to JC Penney and bought a crewel embroidery kit.  It wasn't for anybody, it wasn't a gift, it was just for me to do.  I loved it.  Now I have gotten myself into the mindset that I MUST make Christmas ornaments or greeting cards or sell my finished cross stitch pictures on Ebay.  Somehow I have lost the ability to just do something for the sake of doing it without some sort of ulterior motive.  This is why I have lost interest.I have now taken up coloring and it is very enjoyable because there is absolutely nothing to do with the end product but to enjoy the process.  Nobody wants a coloring sheet I have done, nobody is going to buy it and there is absolutely no worth in it except for the enjoyment that I get from doing it.  I see a lot of coloring going on in 2017.I still read.  I love to read.  However, I have joined several reading challenges -- mostly on Goodreads -- the last several years and while it did prompt me to read more books, I think it has had a negative affect on my reading.  I feel like I have to read faster just to meet my \"goal\" and I don't necessarily enjoy the books as much if I am rushing.  I also don't like the feeling that I have \"failed\" to meet my goal -- like this year.So, starting in 2017 I don't think I will do anymore Reading Challenges.  I think I am just going to read and keep a list -- my own reading challenge so to speak.  Some books just require more mulling over, some books aren't meant to be finished or need to be put aside for a while, some books are quick reads and maybe aren't so monumental.  I think I am just going to enjoy the books as they come to me and document it here on this blog just like I am doing with the 2016 Goodreads challenge this year but there isn't going to be a goal or a limit.  It will just be what it is.And that is about as close to a resolution as I am going to get."},
{"title": "Christmas is Over", "date": "Monday, December 26, 2016", "text": "Today is the day after Christmas.  I had a good Christmas although it didn't seem like Christmas at all.  I suspect that all the frivolity got lost in my \"to - do\" list.  Toward the end of summer I made a list of all the things I wanted to get accomplished before the end of the year.My list was comprised of lots of household things as well as my own health to take care of.  It was all complicated by my mother in law falling and breaking her hip in September.  She had surgery and was in rehab for an unbelievably long time -- 'till mid-November.  In the middle of her stay there my husband had cataract surgery which, between both eyes, took six weeks.  Not complaining as his vision is much, much better which I would have expected but it is sort of amazing to see it.  Anyway, after all that was done, I had several health care appointments to keep.We also had scheduled for our new roof to be installed.  Every roof in our neighborhood has been replaced due to hail damage from storms last spring.  While we were waiting for that to happen, our a/c decided to go out and that needed to be replaced.  Of course, with the new roof came new gutters so after the old gutters were taken down the husband decided we needed to go ahead and repaint before the new gutters were put up.  So, he has been painting the exterior of the house.  There isn't much and the way the house is built it isn't too difficult -- or so he says and since I am not the one doing it, I choose to believe him.  That is almost complete.  We are painting the patio ceiling blue like they do in South Carolina.  It is supposed to keep wasps from making nests in the corners.  Oh, and it is supposed to keep the spirits away!So, in the middle of all this home caring and health caring and mother in law caring came Christmas.  Christmas is pretty quiet for us these days.  The children are grown and gone with children of their own and plans of their own.  We celebrate with them but it isn't the same.  My shopping has changed as the grown ups don't really need anything and they are all picky (sorry, just telling the truth) so they get money and they can go get their own present.  The kiddos, well, I try to do the four things -- something they want, something they need, something to play with, and something to read.  I guess I just didn't want to wrack my brain (is that even a word?) so the something they want turned out to be money, the something they need was pajamas, the something to play with are games and puzzles and the something to read ended up being a Barnes & Noble gift card.  I usually like buying them books but there were a lot of restrictions this year so I just opted to let them pick out their own.  So, there wasn't much shopping going on for sure.  It makes me sad that I don't shop like I used to but, with all the other stuff going on, maybe it is better.  I probably would have been a blithering idiot by now.  Also, I didn't send many cards this year.  I don't know how I feel about that -- I will revisit that next year.I did like it that Christmas was on Sunday.  Somehow that just seemed right.  I wasn't prepared for no mail delivery today though, that seems NOT right.  But now it is business as usual which, honestly, I am ready for.I don't know why but I  tend to get sad over the holidays and I am not sure why.  My parents have been gone a long time now.  I am used to my children being gone.  I have no idea but the melancholy just seems to set in.  I almost took the Christmas tree down today but I usually leave it up until Epiphany.  Not sure I will make it this year.Tomorrow I am going to continue de-cluttering my closet and making a bag of items to be donated.  I also need to go through the magazine basket and start recycling those things.  I guess you could say I am starting an early spring cleaning.  The weather has been so warm here that you would think it was spring -- I wonder if this is going to be another winter-less year.  Bad for us -- good for a bumper crop of disease ridden mosquitoes.  We need several days of freezing weather to get rid of those.We had two snakes on the patio today.  That is all I can say about that.  I only saw one of them -- very small little grass snake.  I went back in the house.  I don't do snakes.So, that is all that is going on here at Maison Brinkley (haha -- that cracks me up).  Hopefully the paint will be done tomorrow and then we can start on the inside.  That I am not looking forward to at all.  Hate the smell of paint.  And we are going to replace carpet.  It is all exhausting and I am not even the one doing it.Ok, enough of this, I must go get the cedar pollen off of me and try to continue reading the book I have been stuck on for over a month now.  Slow going, very slow going.Be back soon!"},

Where has the month gone?  Actually, where has the autumn gone? September, October and November were ridiculously busy.  My planner had something on each and every day.  I hadn't been that busy since I had kids at home.  I put a lot of things off because of the priority of other things and I have spent the last two weeks playing catch up.  It is going well and all I have left is to get a crown scheduled and a doctor appointment at the end of the month.So, I don't guess I need to tell  you that Christmas has sort of taken a backseat to all the catching up.  I haven't mailed any Christmas cards out yet.  I have a couple of gifts left to buy which I will try to do tonight.  I have to make a list of food to buy and order a ham -- yay! for Honeybaked Ham Company. I haven't wrapped a thing although I did buy paper.  I don't really like buying Christmas wrap so I try to buy something that I can use for other things.  The Container Store is good for that. I have a quilt project that I have been working on and that I was hoping to get finished today but it wasn't meant to be.  I need to work on it tonight and maybe, just maybe I can get it done by the weekend.  That would be phenomenal. So, yeah, it is ten days until Christmas and I am so far from being ready it isn't even funny.  Guess I should go get read.  Ta!"},

Or music, maybe?  I will have to try that.I guess you could say I have a case of the Bah-Humbugs.  What to do, what to do.  I can't let this get the best of me -- if I do I will really regret it.  I have a list a mile long of things to get done and I can't seem to get started.  I have lost my mojo, I guess -- never really knew what \"mojo\" was but I think mine is gone.Well, I think I will take my Christmas book to bed and see if I can get a little more inspired.Hmmmm.......this isn't good!"},

{"title": "Cranky", "date": "Monday, November 07, 2016", "text": "HA! This made me smile today!  My daughter posted it on her FB page early this morning -- something to do with jeans not fitting.  Perhaps if she hadn't partied so hardy at a wedding reception on Saturday night this morning would have been different.  I feel that excess wine make you retain stuff -- water, wedding cake, reception fare -- whatever.  It made me laugh.I also reminded me to not let the day make ME cranky -- I need to practice \"going with the flow\". We are getting a new roof and it was scheduled to be installed in December. Well, they called last week and said they would be installing today and tomorrow.  I am so excited.  However, it is raining.  They haven't showed up with the materials yet and I am getting bummed.  Hopefully the rain will go away, the materials will, well, materialize and I won't have to get cranky.My favorite way of cleaning house is to walk through the house with a trash bag and just tossing everything that has stacked up, fallen down, doesn't have a home or has lost it's usefulness.  You would be surprised how quickly things get better.  I especially like doing this with my vanity which seems to get messy very quickly.  And the coffee table  in the den.  Makes all the difference in the world.  Anyway, that was the first thing on my to-do list today, after we watched the roofers deliver the roofing material. So, no roofer yet so no trash bag cleaning.  I seem to be just sitting here waiting.  Don't you just hate it when that happen?Tomorrow is election day.  I can't wait for it to be over. I have been doing more reading on hygge-- the Danish lifestyle idea.  It sounds so lovely and calm and quiet. And cozy! Sounds wonderful.  I am looking forward to fires in the fireplace and warm, thick socks but we seem to be stuck in late summer here.  There was a fall feel in the air yesterday and I actually got chilled so maybe fall is finally on it's way.I tried some refrigerated organic cinnamon rolls this morning.  Immaculate Baking Company cinnamon rolls.  They were ok.  Not as good as mine but then not as time consuming as mine.  They are in a tube just like Pillsbury and such and I had to laugh, I couldn't get the stupid tube open.  I banged it on the counter, I poked it with a spoon -- it just wouldn't pop.  Well,  seems I hadn't taken off all the wrapper! Duh!  Such a dumb bunny.  Anyway, I will buy them again. I miss buying processed convenience foods.  I mean, I grew up in the 50's where convenience foods were new and very popular -- I don't remember my mother ever making a cake from scratch -- they all came from a box and honestly, I still prefer them.  I have been trying to cook more from scratch and not use convenience foods but the organic food industry is getting better and I am finding that I am, again, turning to convenience foods albeit the organic choice and they aren't bad.  Horizons or Amy's mac and cheese come to mind.The thing I can't get around though, is canned green beans.  Green Giant kitchen sliced green beans, specifically.  Frozen green beans are just soggy and fresh go bad before I get them cooked it seems. Sprouts does have green beans in non-BPA cans but they just aren't the same.  Guess I am going to just have to suck it up  for the Green Giant variety. My reading has sort of gone south lately.  I am still reading \"A Man Called Ove\" and I am enjoying it -- it isn't draggy or anything but I keep getting interrupted.  I don't think I am going to meet my Goodreads 2016 goal.  In fact, I don't think next year I am going to participate in the challenge but just keep a list of the books I read on here for my own information.  I find that when I try to keep up with these challenges I am just reading as fast as I can to complete the challenge and not necessarily enjoying the book.  I want to enjoy the books more than complete the challenge.  So, I think that is going to be my goal for next year.  sort of goes along the whole \"hygge\" thing, doesn't it?Well, the roofer isn't here. The rain has stopped, I have no more excuses so I must get up and grab that trash bag.  Have a wonderful day!"},

They were all lovely families with well-kept secrets and mysteries and lots and lots of money and gorgeous clothes -  probably not so far from the truth, actually.I don't do that anymore.  Or, at least I didn't think I did.We are taking a new route home from Bean's in the afternoon.  It takes us through a neighborhood very much like the one we lived in the first 16 years of our marriage.  Yesterday I found myself looking at the houses and making up stories about the people in them.Hmmmm.......is this a sign of ADHD, impending senility or literary brilliance?Yes, I think so!"},

I hope today is being good to you.  It has been a lovely day thus far in spite of the fact that things are falling apart at a rapid rate around here.Bear in mind that our house is only 12 years old.  It was new construction when we purchased and we have been the only occupants.  We were thrilled that everything just worked and we had no desire to knock out walls, re-do tile or add anything on.It has been fine except now age is creeping in and things are getting wonky.  We have to have a new roof.  Now, that has nothing to do with age but rather the extreme hail storm we had in the spring.  Huge hail.  Destroyed roof.  However, since we live in a gated community we have an HOA which is a good/bad thing.  It keeps us from having to deal with turquoise paint and pink flamingos in the yard but on the flip side, everything we do we have to have \"approved\".  It wouldn't be bad if our architectural committee didn't have \"control issues\" and \"power issues\" and, well, you get the picture.  So, we got the almighty approval and got on the docket with the roofer.  We will have a new roof in December.  Yes, December.  I am underwhelmed and just hoping we aren't solidly into ice/snow by then.Then, a couple of weeks ago our ceiling fan in our bedroom died.  It is remote controlled, no pull chains, and apparently the thingy in the fan went out and there is no way to make it work.  We researched a new part to make the remote work.  Apparently they quit making that new part.  So, we went out and bought a new fan today.  Why you ask?  Why today?Because sometime Friday our air conditioning went out.  My husband thought it was a capacitor.  He replaced the capacitor.  Not the problem.  He called the hvac guy.  The guy said they could come but being a weekend it would be twice the amount of money and they couldn't fix it until Monday anyway.  He said to try to hang in there until Monday and they would be out.  Nice guy.  Saved us some money.  It is 90 degrees today.  Upon further review, my husband thinks the yard guys, who seem hell bent on destroying everything in the path of their lawnmowers, has cut the freon line because there is very apparent damage to the compressor box.  Now, these lawn guys have messed up window facings, they have broken yard decor and they have actually ripped the gutters off the house.  I really don't like these yard guys.  So, we went to Lowe's and bought a new fan and a spanking brand new 12' ladder so he could get to the 14 ft. ceiling.  We made sure we didn't buy a remote control fan but rather one with a pull chain.  It has taken him six hours to install this fan.The pull chain doesn't work.The joys of home ownership."},

It was a really amazing display and I would love to see it again when half the population of San Antonio wasn't there.And now, for my latest card --A cute little birthday card for a cute little girl.  Hopefully one of these days I will grasp the concept of getting the elements straight and centered.  But, until then, this will have to do.Today has started out better.  I have been off social media for most of the morning which is a good thing.  I took my blood pressure and it was quite normal.  I have gotten laundry done, the card finished, a gift wrapped, the dishwasher unloaded and reloaded, I am dressed and enjoying the rain.  It has been raining since about 5 a.m. We need the rain and the lower temps are very refreshing.  Sunshine this afternoon - sounds like a good day coming up!Happy Friday, all!"},

Garcia's.  The food was good, the fellowship outstanding, and the weather cooperated.  A good time was had by all.My mother in law fell in September and broke her hip.  She had surgery and after a week was placed in a rehab center.  She is still there.  I think she is getting too comfortable there, even though she doesn't like it.  So, all the visiting and laundry is keeping us busy.I have made a couple of cards.  My grandson had his first piano recital last week.  Has only taken lessons for four months and he was outstanding. I didn't know what to take him for his achievement -- flowers didn't seem right -- so I made him a card.  I should have taken a photo.  Today I made a card for my eldest granddaughter who is having a birthday party tomorrow night.  I will take a photo of that when it is complete.Other than that, there isn't much newsworthy going on.  We had fall for a few minutes and it is pretty summery again.  That is ok.  I can handle it, at least it isn't 107 degrees.  Hopefully I will emerge from this depression I have gotten myself into soon.  It is exhausting and annoying -- even for me! I am sure I will feel better after November 8.  Or maybe not."},
{"title": "Falling is Getting Closer!", "date": "Thursday, September 15, 2016", "text": "I can feel it in the air!  It has been a bit cooler in the mornings although it is still summer in the afternoons!  We had a bit of rain this evening with lots of lightening.  I don't like driving in the rain but I love sleeping in the rain so I am ready for some over night showers.I have been having some problems with my feet.  I think I might have hurt them while exercising but not sure, it might have been from some shoes I was wearing.  At any rate, about three weeks ago I noticed my right ankle started feeling like it was sprained.  Well, it kept on and then it just started swelling.  And it hurt.  My entire foot hurt.  I could touch my toes with my other foot and it hurt all the way up my ankle.  We went to San Antonio and walked all over and it just got worse -- what a surprise.  So, finally I decided to rub it with some Absorbine, Jr.  Remember Absorbine, Jr?  Well, it worked!  No more swelling and the pain is almost completely gone.  It still hurts but I haven't worn the offending shoes anymore (bye bye $125) and I bought some new shoes.I bought some Tieks!  You know, those cute little ballet flats with the ridiculous price tag?  It took everything I had to order these shoes because I just don't spend money recklessly.  I am very judicious when I shop and I rarely buy anything that isn't on sale.  I buy basic stuff and don't replace things very often.  But......I had to try these shoes. My feet have been miserable for a long time and I finally figured out why.  When being sized I am right on the line between two sizes.  Vanity always causes me to buy the smaller and I think that is a mistake.  I also require \"wides\" -- on my right foot.  So, I buy wides and the left foot swims in my shoes.  Not much can be done about that.  However, I have high arches and every time I try to buy trainers or any sort of lace up shoe I just about go crazy until I get them off.  They are just plain uncomfortable.  One night it dawned on me that I remember a conversation with my mother about my father's feet.  He always had to wear slip on shoes because he couldn't stand lace up shoes because of his high arches -- problem explained -- I have my father's feet. So, between wide feet, high arches and vanity I have a shoe problem.  I have one pair of shoes from SAS Shoes that work pretty well --  they have a wide toe box which accommodates the wide feet (Flintstone feet, I like to call them) but they go across the top of my foot and that is annoying.  So......I am hoping that these little ballet flats with the ridiculous price tag makes my feet happy.  I started to say \"my little feet\" but that would have just been wrong on so many levels.  There isn't much shoe to them, no support and no padding but there are also no straps, ties, high sides, etc.  I mean, something has to work doesn't it?I clearly was meant to be barefoot. Like the Flintstones."},

{"title": "Catching Up and Sit-upons.", "date": "Tuesday, August 16, 2016", "text": "The last couple of weeks have been a whirlwind of activity getting ready for school and Girl Scouts and after school activities.  Yes, I know, I am a retired grandmother -- how does this affect me?  Well, when  you are the after school pickup of a suddenly active child, it affects you.The duty of being an assistant Girl Scout leader has fallen on me as none of the troop mothers could do it.  This is odd for me because I was only a Girl Scout for a short time -- a LONG time ago -- so I am having to wrack my brain to remember much of anything about it.  We were discussing projects and my daughter mentioned the cushions for the girls to sit on.  Back in the deep crevices of my brain I sort of remembered these and when I did a google search I was reminded of the name of them -- sit-upons! So, we decided to gather the goods for the girls to make sit-upons.  While trying to find a photo of one to put here as we haven't done ours yet I discovered a number of new ways to accomplish this task including using extra large ziplock bags.  Using those you simply fill the bag with whatever stuffing you choose (we will be using my daughter's 250 saved plastic grocery bags), zip them up and seal with decorated duct tape.  The girls also decorated a piece of paper with their name and decorations and put it on top of the stuffing so the stuffing didn't really show.  Now, mind you, when I saw this I had already purchased materials to use -- plastic tablecloths and yarn.  I have plans to cut them into 18 inch squares, punch the holes and let the girls lace them shut.  More hands on than just stuffing a bag and more cost effective, too.  I had to laugh at myself for wanting to take the easy way out -- when my mother and our other leader were going through GS training and they wanted them to start a fire by rubbing two sticks together, my mother's friend promptly pulled out her cigarette lighter and started the fire.  They failed fire starting and had to start over and they weren't allowed to go home until the mission was accomplished.  They finally managed to get a spark and were allowed to leave but it was a long, long day.  So, me wanting to just fill ziplock bags reminded me of my mom -- funny the things that jog memories.Ours are going to be red with white yarn for lacing.  Walmart didn't have a huge selection of plastic tablecloths -- especially when I was looking for the PEVA or EVA options.  Before I cut anything out, though, it has to pass Leader Bri's muster though.  Hmmm....maybe she will like the ziplock bag idea.Looking for ziplock bag coupons.  I think that idea is a winner.  I will post photos."},

There have been five burials since the last reunion two years ago, the most recent two weeks ago.Today we had the opportunity to go through boxes of papers and pictures belonging to family members long gone.  We were encouraged to take what we wanted, the cousin who had these in his possession didn't really want to have to take any of it home.  I managed to bring home some meaningful paper work involving the farmland that Adolph acquired when he relocated to Central Texas, some photos of the original \"homeplace\" as my mother in law calls it, some family portraits -- there was so much stuff -- some of it relevant to my husband's life and some not so much.  It was quite the genealogical find.  It fills a box.  It still strikes me oddly sad that a piece of paper, a bill of sale, a list of purchases at the feed store can outlast people.  These common everyday items seem to have so much meaning.The next reunion will be in two years.  Is this going to be just a \"cousins\" reunion with all the old folks gone to glory?  Are we now the old folks? Is it going to be in the country again like it usually is or will it be at the new venue that we were at today.  Changing, changing, things keeps changing. Whatever it is, wherever it is -- I am sure we will go."},

I used a Colorbox white stamp pad and dauber to stencil  the design and the ink just soaked into the paper.  So, I started over and decided blue would work -- I like blue at Christmas.  So, here it is.Now I have a lot of sweeping and reorganizing to do.No procrastination!"},

Anyway I did find some time to do some card making. I only made one and my photography is really bad.  I have a new camera and didn't know how to turn the flash off so I had to enlist the photography guru to show me how.  So, anyway, here are the fruits of my latest efforts.The coloring seems to be a bit washed out here but it really isn't.  I made two copies of the stamped image -- one I did in Prismacolor pencils and one I did in Crayola colored pencils.  This one was done with Crayola.  The one I did with the Prismacolor pencils is more vibrant.  It will show up on something eventually but I thought the more subdued colors went well with the muted, soft toned papers.  However, it is more colorful than it appears here.  Sorry for the poor photography but I shake a bit and the light was miserable. I need to work on my photography skills.I have been playing with my Cuttlebug but I am bummed to find out that I need an additional plate and they don't carry it at my neighborhood Joann.  I bought a set of Spellbinders dies but need the plate before I can use them.  This is getting to be a rather pricey hobby so I am cutting myself off for the moment.  Not sure if  I will be keeping the the die set or not. So, that is what has been taking up my time these days.Oh, and I have put down \"the book\" and have taken up this one --It is pretty good so far and I will review when I am done. Well, off to the dentist!  Have a great Monday!"},

Do fun things, eat hot dogs and watch fireworks and never, ever forget who we are and what we stand for.  Ever."},

As you can see I haven't even opened them all up yet -- just waiting for the proper inspiration.  All of the punches are of a very basic variety so I suspect I will use them often.I bought a Cuttlebug.  I am not convinced I need this nor am I convinced it was the proper purchase but it did fit into the budget although I could have gotten it cheaper online.  However, since I am still on the fence about it a return will be easier if purchased locally.  As you can see -- I haven't even taken it out of the box but Hobby Lobby has a 90 day return policy if I opt out.So, that is what has been helping me straddle  this lumpy hump I have been trying to get over.  Today I might have to go pick up some other inks and things.  I have been watching youtube videos about distressing and texturing and all that sort of thing and I \"need\" some more stuff.  Actually, I am pretty sure I don't really need more stuff but  I could still use a bit of cheering up. Hee hee!I don't even need to mention how all the paper is affecting me.  Paper --- fabric --- all the same sort of delightfulness.  I feel the same way when I look at the paper as I do when I look at fabric.  There is just something about it.  Honestly, though, paper is what I lack.  Back in my scrapbooking days I had lots and lots of paper but I passed it on to my daughter when I discovered I had no intention of scrapbooking.  There was tons of it to buy loose by the page.  Now, while you can still buy the loose pages, it seems that the majority of it is available in coordinated tablets which is brilliant.  I will have to check into some of those as this obsession hobby progresses.  I did notice a rather large display of Christmas card making supplies at HL the other day -- I became immediately confused and walked away.  I have some idea for Christmas cards, though, borrowed, not original, unfortunately. I am not that clever.So, anyway, that is my \"stash\" -- partial, I am sure.  I now see my husbands joy in gearing up for a project -- if the project never happens the gearing up part is a good part of the fun!"},

{"title": "Dreams -- Bad or Otherwise", "date": "Tuesday, June 28, 2016", "text": "My father loved to dream.  He always said his dreams were vivid and exciting and gave him great ideas -- the artistic mind, I suppose.  I wasn't so fond of my dreams.  I had a tendency toward one particular recurrent dream that I found frightening as a child.  My parents and I -- and the cat -- were standing at the curb watching the house burn down.  I had that dream regularly until I was 19 when the house did burn down.  I never had the dream again.It has been years since I have had anything remotely close to a recurrent dream until last night.  Sometime in the past I dreamed about my parents and in the dream I hadn't seen them in a long, long time so I went to their house to see them.  When I went into the house (which was my childhood home, the one that burned down) my dad was sitting at the dining room table shirtless (which was his norm) and my mother was a bit disheveled and ill -- she was crying.  They were in a big mess.  They had no food, the bills hadn't been paid, the house needed repair -- they hadn't done anything since my last visit which was long ago.  He said they were waiting for me to come and bring food but they didn't know when I would be there.  I was upset and trying to figure out how I could take care of them, I felt guilty and despairing. I had the same dream last night. I took care of my parents through both of their illnesses and deaths and I thought I did a pretty good job considering I had a traveling husband and two school age children as well.  I did my best but was my best good enough?  Are they telling me I failed them somehow? It was disturbing and has left me very grumbly this morning.  I didn't sleep well and now I have this hanging in my subconscious.I have had what I think are visitation dreams.  Now, I am sure that as a Christian I am not supposed to believe in such things but those dreams were different and fulfilled the definition of \"visitation dream\".  This was not that.  This was just plain disturbing and I am still shaking about it.Then, when I just about got settled into a dreamless sleep the phone rang and woke me up. Now I am just in a bad mood.Has anybody else had recurrent dreams?  Visitation dreams?  Opinions?"},
{"title": "Happy First Date Anniversary!", "date": "Sunday, June 26, 2016", "text": "Today is the 51st anniversary of our first date.  We went to a local theater to see a James Bond double feature.  We are celebrating by having homemade pizza and watching \"Dr. No\" which was one of the movies we saw that night.Yum!Ok, I am an anomaly.  I have a strong artistic desire but absolutely no artistic talent.  So, what do I do?  I dabble in crafts sometimes.I quilt and really enjoy combing color combinations of fabric.  My quilts will always look like a beginner quilter because I am more interested in the color and fabric than I am the block pattern or the quilting design.I do cross stitch because that almost seems like painting to me.  Of course, I don't make up patterns of my own, I use other's creations but sometimes I change the colors around. I can't knit or crochet -- I just simply don't have the gene for that which makes me sad but I do have a set of those round knitting things that I am going to teach myself to use.  Someday. But, I have been intrigued by something else of late.  Cardmaking.  I have a friend who makes the loveliest cards and they are a joy to get.  I have to say she is quite the inspiration.I have tried my hand at cardmaking before but it was basically a blank card with stickers and it was a LONG time ago.  Since then the internet is teeming with all sorts tutorials and ideas and such so I decided to give it a go.  Today.And this is the fruit of my effort --I did learn from my early attempt that you have to have lots of stuff to make cards.  Paper, ribbons, some way to stick it all down, blank cards, colored pencils, punches, embossing things, design elements -- the list goes on and on.  I have been making an attempt to acquire some of these necessary items and now that I have a few things I am going to have to make some cards to justify the purchases.  So, anyway, what probably would have taken an experienced cardmeister fifteen minutes to make took me --- wait for it --- drumroll -- five hours.  Yes, five hours and a trip to Joann Fabrics for \"design elements\".  I broke a sweat.  I struggled but the card is made and ready to be mailed.  It is definitely masculine so it will probably go to the next male having a birthday.  Now I have to work on some girly stuff which will probably mean more \"stuff\" and \"bling\".  I wonder if I can sell these?It has been a few days since my last blog post.  You are probably curious about what I have been doing.  No?  Cool.  The fact of the matter is I have been doing very little of any import.  It is hot here which makes trying to do anything outdoors pretty miserable and draining -- not that I do much outdoors anyway.  Getting into a hot car and navigating the ridiculous traffic isn't fun either so we have been pretty much staying at home.I have done a craft project -- a tooth fairy box.  I decided to do this rather than a tooth fairy pillow.  The tooth was just about to come out so I put a rush on it.  The tooth still hasn't come out -- stubborn tooth.  Anyway, here is my creation such as it is. It is made from an altoid-type metal box and scraps of scrapbooking paper, felt and rick rack.  It was fun and quick to make and possesses just the right amount of tacky.I have been making an effort to cook at home more.  I decided to make some potato soup from a very famous, down-home, cook's recipe and I just have to say it was dreadful.  I will be sticking to my own recipe, thank you which is pretty much potatoes cooked and mashed with some chicken broth and milk added.  Now THAT is potato soup.  Oh well, you live and learn.  The rest of the menu involved ham and cheese sandwiches.The sandwich was ok, the soup not so much.  I also made bread in the bread maker and I just have to say I prefer the bread I make without the bread maker.  That is on taps for today, I think.And, here are a couple of pics of Bean's kinder graduation -- I have to admit I shed tears through the whole thing.  They sang, and acted out, \"If I Were a Butterfly\" and I am proud to say she was the very best butterfly -- ever.So sorry but the light was really bad in the church.  It is a lovely church but a photography nightmare. I rarely go to Walmart but we went the other day to get some stuff to make Hubs new tires shiny.  I happened across theseand I couldn't resist.  I purged the kitchen of all my old cup towels a while back and bought two new sets of four each in turquoise and white stripe but I thought these were lovely and the non-terry ones will look lovely in the bread basket at meals. So, that is what I have been up to.  Reading has come to a screeching halt because I am stuck on a book I just really want to finish but really don't want to read.  Ah, first world problems, what can I say.  I am working on some unfinished sewing projects that I would like to complete before the end of summer -- a couple of them before the end of this week, actually! Good luck to moi on that.Anyway that brings you up to date on my incredibly dull summer thus far.  Hope yours is better. My next post will probably include mention of my new crafting obsession -- cardmaking.  I am intrigued yet terrified.  I am building an arsenal of tools and gadgets with which to create these cards.  More to come.  Maybe."},

Well, now I am paying attention to it.  I discovered yesterday that it does a bang up job of dusting baseboards.  So, I put my extension cord on and am going to town.  Should I give him credit?  Nah! Yeah, I should.Monday was quite the frustrating day in regards to laundry.  I like to do laundry every day so I don't have lots of stuff pile up.  I learned that when we had a power outage a few years ago.  So, Monday I set off to do my wash in the washer and dryer we have had for about 14 years.  It is a Kenmore and had done exceedingly well.  We have only had one repair in all those years.  However, the old girls have been getting grumpy as of late.  Not full blow cantankerous but I could see it coming on.  Sunday I washed a load of whites -- not a large large, just some of hubs unmentionables.  I had to push the start button three times to get it to start -- not an unusual circumstance.  Then I put them in the dryer and dried them on medium-high for 45 minutes.  They were wet.  Repeat.  Forgot about them until Monday morning.  Went in to fold.  They were wet.We went shopping.Yesterday this was delivered to my house --along with the companion dryer.  I should have taken my own photo.  Maybe I will later.I am thrilled.  Yes, they are OLD SCHOOL -- Speed Queen -- made in the USA.  Fabulous warranty.  All metal.  Do they look sophisticated?  No.  Do they play music for me?  Uh, no.  Are they tall? With drawers?  No, but my old ones were.  Am I ok with that?  Oh yes because it doesn't feel like my laundry room is being eaten by my appliances.Most importantly -- do they work?Yes.In fact, I am beginning to think that since they use a whole tub of water my clothes might be getting cleaner.  They feel cleaner and they look like they are rinsed better.  There is none of that musty smell that I used to have with the front loader.Am I pleased with my purchase?***Squee!!!***"},
{"title": "The One Good Thing", "date": "Wednesday, June 08, 2016", "text": "about, uh, let's just say \"maturing\" is finally getting comfortable in your own skin.  This takes a while because you have to go through periods of competing with other teenagers, other young mothers, other co-workers -- you get my drift.  You have to be what the world wants you to be which might be a far cry from what you really are.There comes a time when you don't have to do that anymore.  I have reached that point.I have been reading blogs about what a \"60 something\" should look like.  Hmm...well, I guess leggings with gladiator heels just aren't \"me\".  So, I go to the mall the other day -- the first time in I can't even tell you how long -- and looked around at my fellow mall shoppers trying to discern what was in their minds when they got dressed.  There must be a code I can't crack because I never figured it out.  I didn't see much of the fashion forward thought that I see on the blogs. My conclusion -- appeal to your own sensibilities and I headed off to Lands End.  I am comfortable there -- hanging close to their sale rack which is still too pricey but you gotta do what you gotta do. Gladiator sandals?  Hmmm....heading off to SAS Shoes. My feet hurt, I have arthritis, I am 60 something -- does anybody care what I wear on my feet?  Doubtful.  I am pretty sure nobody is looking at me saying \"what WAS she thinking\".  Actually, I am pretty sure nobody is looking at me at all -- I have reached that invisible age. That is fine with me.That means I can do what I want -- dress for comfort, read what I want, frequent the locally owned businesses, just make myself happy.I am friends with a couple who have recently moved from Los Angeles to Asheville, North Carolina.  They are people who, how can I say it, are right up my alley.  I grew up in an arty, literary, unconventional sort of existence that made me feel different than all my contemporaries.  This couple is so like the people my parents were friends with.  In any event, they have this gorgeous home in Asheville and occasionally the Mrs. will post photos of her lovely abode.  It is like a veritable art gallery.  The things they live with have history, like a small table that was her bedside table as a child, and the art is magnificent.  I am sure that if I were to visit I would be quite rude in just looking at all their stuff.  They have good stuff. But the point is, they live with what they love and don't worry about making it look like a furniture store showroom with meaningless things.  I love that.That is a perk of being older -- you have a history and your environment shows it. As I am aging I am noticing that my spending habits are changing.  While I would still like to binge shop once in a while, I am noticing that I am definitely going for quality over quantity and I tend to not throw things away quite as readily as I used to.  Yesterday I had an almost uncontrollable desire to toss everything in my bathrooms and go \"redecorate\".  However, I talked myself out of it and decided I would rather go to the new bookstore and buy a new book.I realize that it is only June but my thoughts have been meandering toward Christmas.  We have two locally owned stores close by that I really like -- Toyworks and Monkey and Dog Books. I think my Christmas shopping for the kids will be centered around these two stores.  Again, quality over quantity.  The toy store is pricier than, say, ToysRUs but they have unique items and I think I could do ok there.  I don't buy for the children like I used to -- they all have enough to open their own toy stores -- so I like to look for things that are maybe a bit unusual.  The book store has such a lovely variety of books and the location is magical -- the corner of a catering business -- I know how it sounds but if it were around when I was a child I would have loved to have spent a rainy day in there.Again, I have finally become comfortable doing what I want.And part of what I want is to frequent local businesses.  Our new bookstore -- The Last Word -- has such great potential.   It is lovely.  I am hoping it grows into a modern day Rosengren's of San Antonio fame. It was announced that they are going to become part art gallery as well.  Now, if somebody would just bring a coffee pot it would be wonderful. So, as I awoke this morning, giving thanks for being here another day, I thought about how my and Hubs life has evolved.  We are finally free spirits.  We can progress through the rest of our days as we please.  I can wear what I want and what makes me happy.  I can bob my hair and go without makeup if I want.  NOBODY CARES!!! And if I don't care then it is ok.  We don't have to keep up pretenses. Whew! What a wonderful day!(Ok, I know this was a completely random post!)"},
{"title": "Me and PaPa", "date": "Thursday, June 02, 2016", "text": "I was going through some photos on the computer and I ran across this one.  This is my grandfather, James W. Davis and me at my 3rd birthday party in 1953.  I remember this birthday party well and I remember that little basket handbag.  I also got a red duster just like a grown up lady.  I should get the other photos out so you could see my cousins and my lovely cake.  Can you believe it was February?  This nice day was the norm for South Texas winter.  Sigh -- three was great. Beverly Miranda -Whittemore, New York Times bestselling author of Bittersweet says this about Eve Chase's Black Rabbit Hall -- \"A twisting gothic of family secrets, forbidden lust, and four extraordinary children who'll stick with you long after they've scattered off the page.\"I purchased this novel on a whim -- no research or anything -- and I was expecting a bit of Shirley Jackson (The Haunting of Hill House) and V.C. Andrews (Flowers in the Attic).  My first impression wasn't wrong but it wasn't quite right, either.  While Black Rabbit Hall did possess some of the elements of Shirley Jackson it wasn't anywhere near as frightening.  I was a bit disappointed but not disappointed enough to stop reading, for sure.  It also possessed elements of V. C. Andrews works but not nearly as graphic.  I was fine with that -- it was graphic enough for me, thank you.  I guess I would have to say it was a kinder, gentler sort of gothic novel. It is the story of Lorna who is looking for a wedding venue.  She and her fiance Jon visit Pencraw Hall, also known as Black Rabbit Hall.  Lorna falls in love with the place, is inexplicably drawn to it and Jon is -- well -- not.It is also the story of the Alton family -- Hugo, Nancy, Amber, Toby, Barney and Kitty.  They are happy and in the blink of an eye they aren't.  They are a family intact and suddenly they are a family torn completely apart.There is love and lust, forbidden alliances, deaths, an evil stepmother, adversity and survival.It is a good read, I would definitely recommend but it is a little wordier than I think necessary.  Other than that, though, I would say it is a keeper."},
{"title": "Intentional Decorating", "date": "Monday, May 30, 2016", "text": "Learned a new term today -- intentional decorating.  It is sort of like minimalism in that you don't keep clutter -- but it is less like minimalism that you don't get rid of everything you own.  The idea is that you keep things that have a purpose and that you enjoy and get rid of things that don't serve a purpose.  Do I need to remind you of that last visit to Pier 1 where you went berserk?  I think not.So, I was doing some blog reading today while I really should have been doing other things (Oh well, I will live) and I ran across some blogs about intentional decorating and I decided to apply the principals to my own bedroom.My house is what I would call \"eclectic\".  It is furnished with furniture from our early marriage, our middle marriage and our current marriage -- same two people, three different lifetimes!  That would mean some Early American, some traditional cherry, some arts and crafts style and some transitional painted pieces -- mostly black.  Does it all mesh?  Well, yeah, to a point.  Of course, I am used to it -- to anybody new walking in it might just be a hot mess.  To me it is home and it is comfortable.My husband and I have some differences of opinion about decorating though.  There are things he just doesn't like -- throw pillows come to mind (\"the only thing they are good for is throwing on the floor to get them out of the way\"), heavy bed cover and dusty bed pillows.  My pet peeves are pillow shams on bed pillows (I hate having to put them back on the pillows in the morning) and generally having to make up the bed, period. I have instituted the rule that the last one out makes up the bed.  It. is. never. me.So, we have been having a conversation about some articles I found regarding bed making.  Now \"they\" (whoever they are) say it is better to let your bed breathe -- in my mind that translates into not making the bed up which, depending on how you \"don't\" make it up, might be fine.  So, today I took the plunge.  I did the unthinkable.  I took the bedspread off the bed.Now, we have been using a traditional, woven bedspread made on historical looms in New England for several years.  It is pretty, looks nice and doesn't have offending pillow shams -- the bedspread just covers the pillows and is tucked under.  It is still a hassle to me.  Now, my husband wants the pillows covered because he is more than a bit paranoid about dust.  Keep in mind, his pillow -- a small buckwheat number -- is safely housed in a drawer away from all dust -- so it is just my pillows getting dusty.  I don't care.So, I got to thinking about the concept of intentional decorating and decided that the bedspread really served no reasonable purpose.  We don't use it for cover (too heavy for Hubs delicate little toes) so it just sits there waiting to be wrangled with the next morning.Since today was sheet changing day I decided to  change things up a bit.  Yes, I retained the soft, wrinkly, organic sheets and topped them with the cotton blankets that we sleep under.  Then, instead of putting the bedspread back on I decided to just use one of my homemade quilts at the bottom.  I don't have a dust ruffle on it  -- yet -- another of my pet peeves.  But, if this works for us I will just pick one up and wrestle the mattress to get it on.  I am thinking that I am going to like this -- it sort of goes along with not using stuff that is unnecessary and that bedspread is unnecessary.The caveat is that I will be having to change the pillowcases more often to rid them of the dreaded dust.  I joke but yes, dust is dreaded.  However, the articles that I have read encouraging the idea of not making your bed states that beds that are tightly made up actually make the dust issue worse as dust mites love that sort of environment.  So, I think I can handle changing the pillow cases every couple of days.  We will see how this works.Now my bedroom coordinates well with the rest of the house -- nothing matches, nothing is formal, everything looks lived in and soft and a bit slouchy.  Yep, that would be us -- lived in, soft and slouchy.I wonder if that is a \"thing\" -- I will have to google it."},

I found this buried under a quilt I am making -- how appropriate.  So, yes, I literally did \"find\" it -- I had forgotten I bought it.So, what was the next logical step?  I abandoned the window seat and set down to start reading, of course!That, is my Friday Find! Have a wonderful weekend!

I decided to look into some of the other cozy mystery series -- I don't understand my recent affinity for mysteries -- I used to never like them -- but, I do now it seems so I decided to see what else was out there and there is plenty, trust me.I picked up the first in the Domestic Diva series by Krista Davis.  The title is \"The Diva Runs Out of Thyme\". It isn't a long book, about 286 pages if you don't read the recipes, but it is such a quick read.  It was a really good mystery as you didn't know the culprit until the end -- it was a busy book, a lot going on and a lot of characters.  Not hard to keep up with but all the activity certainly did obscure the whodunnit.I recommend this book for sure -- not sure about the rest of the series but I will be trying another in the lineup.  Oh, and the cover is great!  And if you read the recipes they look divine! I might even try a couple of them toward the holiday season"},
{"title": "To Make the Bed or To Not Make the Bed -- That is the Question", "date": "Monday, May 16, 2016", "text": "As I was raving about a couple of posts ago, I am disturbed by all the information about ordinary things in our lives being life threatening (need I mention light bulbs?).  It seems that all things in our modern lives come with a certain degree of risk.  I guess that has probably been true across the ages.However, I did see an interesting article about bed making and whether it is a good thing or not -- healthwise of course. Now, we can all say that having your bed made makes you feel good, adds to the tidy appearance of the house and all that.  I think of having an unmade bed similar to staying in pajamas all day -- a practice that doesn't make me feel good at all and I avoid completely.  So, clearly a neatly made bed is good for our emotional health but is it good for our physical health.  The \"experts\" have an opinion on how this daily, mindless task should be accomplished (of course \"they\" do).In the US we tend to make our beds using lots of layers -- a bottom, fitted sheet, a top sheet, blankets, and then a comforter, quilt, or bedspread.  In our house I use a traditional woven bedspread similar to this one.  We don't sleep under it -- it is folded back and just used to \"complete\" the bed in the morning.My husband insists that we be able to cover the pillows to avoid dust accumulation and I find pillow shams to be maddening.  So, this sort of bedspread has been our solution for many years in our marriage.The new trend, however, is toward ditching the top sheet and using just a bottom sheet and a duvet.  My daughter has a duvet and declares it to be really hot so she still uses a top sheet so when she has to throw off the duvet she is still covered. Also, pillows would just be fluffed and placed on the bed uncovered.The idea behind this is that all the unsavory things that we know are in our beds will grow profusely in an environment where the sheets and such are all covered up tight and not able to breathe.  So, the idea is to expose the sheets to the air and let the bed air and dry out and dry up and that will solve a lot of allergy issues.Now, I am all about solving allergy issues but I am not sure about the whole hot duvet and no top sheet thing so I have come up with a possible solution.  I quilt and use cotton batting.  My husband loves my quilts and we use them regularly.  So I am thinking that making the bed with the usual sheet set and then folding a quilt at the bottom for when needed at night -- if needed at night-- leaving the sheets exposed to \"air\".  That sounds ok, in a way.  My husband doesn't like the pillows to be uncovered but since he stows his little buckwheat pillow in a drawer maybe he should just get over it since it is my pillow he is talking about and if I don't care, he shouldn't either.So, tell me, how do others make up their bed? I didn't realize this would be such an interesting subject with so many opinions."},
{"title": "Bruce", "date": "Sunday, May 15, 2016", "text": "For those who have been following this blog for a while have read my posts about Bruce Lewis,  I have tried to make them brief and upbeat but the truth of the matter is that Bruce has been battling an aggressive form of brain cancer for several months.  Last week it was apparent that there were no more options for treatment and no path forward so the decision was made to remove Bruce from life support and provide palliative care.  Bruce passed away this morning.  He leaves his wife, Mundee, and his two children Hans and Echo to carry on.Bruce was a talented artist in the Manga genre.  He  was a devout Christian, a devoted husband and loving father.  He was an all around great guy -- he was interesting, intelligent, goofy, great sense of humor -- you couldn't meet a nicer guy.I first met Bruce when my son was getting married.  Bruce escorted me down the aisle.  He got me to giggling -- which you really don't want to do because I clearly don't have a \"stop\" button when it comes to giggling -- and I was so afraid I was going to laugh through the whole thing.  Others were dabbing at misty eyes but I was giggling at Bruce. Bad Mama!We have spent many birthday celebrations and baptism celebrations with Bruce and Mundee and enjoyed their company so much.  My father was a comic book artist so Bruce was always chatting about that common connection with me.  He could always command interesting conversations and was always so upbeat and fun.The world is going to be a lesser place with Bruce not here but Heaven is rejoicing, I am sure.  Mundee and the kids are left to carry on but there are a whole lot of people that are going to hold her up and help her through -- she is a faithful, strong woman and that will serve her well during this time.So,  as we say our farewells to Bruce and prepare to move on, helping Mundee and his kids, we can say we were blessed to have known this guy and our world is a little better for it."},
{"title": "They'll Be Days Like This My Mama Said", "date": "Saturday, May 14, 2016", "text": "Old song lyrics meant to describe the ups and downs of romance but those words are true regardless of subject matter.This week has been one of a lot of downs.  No, make no mistake, I wake up each and every morning with a prayer of thanks on my lips for giving me another day whatever it holds. I face the day and its challenges with an upbeat attitude and a smile but this last week has left me weary.Why you ask?  Well, our state of being mostly -- as a country, as a society, as a species.  \"Things\" are just not right.  Why is that?  Have \"things\" always been wrong and we just have the information highway to thank for all our knowledge of \"things\" now?  Have \"things\" always been tenuous and in my younger years I was just too busy to notice?  That could be part of it.What are these \"things\" you ask?  There are concrete, tangible things and then there are nebulous things -- feelings.Our country is in trouble.  There is something just so wrong about an elected official trying to rule how we live our lives and run our businesses and then threaten to withhold federal funds if we don't cow-tow to his demands.  We have sunk to a new low level of morality here.  It appears that common decency is a thing of the past.  It would seem that self pride is alive and well but is it?  Back in the day people were too proud to put themselves in positions of controversy.  People lived by a set of moral \"rules\" -- now that is a bad thing.  It seems like everything bad is good and everything good is bad.  There is an overriding feeling of doom and gloom and threat.  We don't know who to trust so we trust no one.  It seems that the days of looking ahead to a bright future have met a brick wall. I blame a lot of this on social media -- i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.  I frequent Facebook and I have taken notice that each time I do my mood drops a few degrees in positivity until, by the end of the day, I am so depressed and dejected that I can hardly stand it.  I hear you saying the obvious -- don't go to Facebook.  Agreed, that would be a wonderful solution but there are two things -- first off I keep up with family that way and secondly it is addictive.  I mean seriously addictive and the more I realize this I see how divisive and subversive it is to our children and our families.  I am not involved with the other media mentioned but I am sure it is the same for them.  I can see where youngsters as well as adults are bullied through these avenues and I can certainly see how so much time is wasted with a phone/tablet in hand to get the latest most important \"news\".I have read a lot of posts on our latest controversy here -- the use of bathrooms by our citizens.  I have read good posts and bad posts.  I have heard such hate coming out of peoples minds and mouths from both sides of the issue -- I am ashamed to say that I have read it.  When did common decency cease to prevail?  I am baffled.I  am perplexed by the number of posts involving sick children, hurt children, abused animals -- I understand it is social media and every person has a right to their platform but it just feeds the already growing depression that seems to be taking over this country. I am troubled by the amount of information discussing the dangers in every aspect of our lives -- our food is all bad, nothing should be eaten, our environment is toxic -- today I learned about how light bulbs can cause cancer and will eventually kill us all.  The air is bad, the water is bad, the food is bad, the medicine is bad --- but is it?  Back to that trust issue.  I feel like we are being lied to across the board about everything and  it puts me in a very defensive mood -- all. the. time.We waiting for word that Bruce has ended his journey here and has begun his life in glory.  It seems there is no more they can do.  As I read about our \"bathroom saga\" and the \"threat\" of light bulbs I think about this young family with so much future cut so short. It seems to me that as a society we have our priorities all wrong, our interests all wrong, our concerns all wrong. Where did we go so wrong?  What have we become?  What can we do?Personally I can't change the world but I can change me and my own environment and that is what I plan today.  Later today I will be emailing my important Facebook \"friends\" telling them that I won't be around much anymore.  I will encourage them to email me with news of their lives.  I won't do away with my account but I will be whittling down my \"friend\" list to probably a half dozen.  I hope people aren't offended but since most of those people don't really know me, they probably won't even notice I have gone.  I will be getting off group lists and when posts show up that disturb me they will be deleted.  I have to be proactive here because my mental/emotional well being is most important to my physical health.So, sorry about the rant.  I have just been overwhelmed by sadness, fear and distrust.  I am hoping that next week will be better.  I will let you know.Have a wonderful Saturday."},

{"title": "Self Discovery", "date": "Tuesday, May 10, 2016", "text": "Well, well, well -- who knew that at my advanced age there would be anything left to discover about myself.  Who knew that I would be feeling challenged and energized in this time when most people are slowing down.  Who knew I would be --A girl scout again.Yes, I am now officially a Girl Scout co-leader.  I will be helping Bean's troop out until one of the mothers comes forward to take on the job.How do I feel about this?  Great! I may be there a few weeks or the whole year but whatever my role is I feel good about it.  I like being around these youngsters -- they are all so smart and clever and eager.  I have had the pleasure of being included in some of the activities this year and it is fun.  I am proud of these girls and they have done so well and it will be a pleasure and privilege to see them mature and grow this next year.Plus, I like crafting.  Camping -- well, we will talk about that later.So, now I get to buy a shirt! Yay! I was looking for my old Girl Scout pins and my mothers pin (she was our Brownie leader) but all have gone missing.  I suspect they are pinned to my Brownie uniform which is buried deep in a trunk and will probably remain there because it is just too much of a hassle to get to the trunk.  So, a shirt and a pin.  I am excited.Yeah, a Girl Scout -- I guess scouting is for life, isn't it?"},
{"title": "Simple Living Challenge", "date": "Saturday, May 07, 2016", "text": "Today is Saturday and time for my Simple Living Challenge that I participate in with Jenn of A Daily Rhythm.  I didn't post last week because I was sans computer but now Lucy is here working with me so I am back on track -- I think.Ok, this last week was not good, not productive, not organized--just not much of anything except a tiny bit of chaos and not for any good reason.  Do you ever have days/weeks that whatever you plan it just goes awry?  Or perhaps you forget to plan at all?  Yes, that was moi this last week.  So, let's see -- on my Scripture Study -- well, I lost several days for no reason except that I just lost my focus.  I made up for it yesterday as I sat down in the early morn with my nice cuppa and my Bible and started where I left off, not worrying about the progress that had been not been made before.  I am reading through the New Testament and using a Bible devotion book that we get at our church.  I started with the Old Testament but got done in my all the names.  I will return to it soon but had to move on with something a bit easier to read.  That's bad, isn't it?My eating plan -- ok, here is where I discovered something completely astonishing and unexpected.  I am using the intuitive eating method and it works quite well if you allow yourself to slow down, stop eating long enough to note how you feel and discipline yourself to quit when you are full.  I am not having a problem with this process as I feel that eating slower is a good thing for digestion to begin with.  However, I slid back into my old mindset and decided just to make sure that I was following the rules I would just write down what I eat -- not measure, not count calories, just write it down.  WELL! The minute I started doing that I started craving stuff all the time and I would eat it and then write it down and before you know it, I was totally off my plan.  My plan is three meals a day, nothing before bed and maybe a snack in the middle of the afternoon as we eat lunch pretty early.  When I went back into \"diet\" mindset, i.e. food journaling, I was hungry.  If I don't do that I do ok.  Talk about mind over matter! I was shocked.  So, for me, this just showed that dieting doesn't work, even sort of dieting.  New plan -- trust my body, not my mind!Housework has gone a bit off this week as we had to care for a sick and ailing g-daughter and then we were sort or sick and ailing ourselves thanks to our mucky air.  I did do my floors and have now caught up with the laundry that went wild over a couple of days but all is good now.  Yesterday was productive even though I didn't really realize it.Exercise --  Ok, I was doing really well until Tuesday.  Previously I had been working some exercise in over the course of the day -- not trying to do it in one go.  Until Tuesday.  Tuesday I decided to just do it all at once.  Well, I got on the floor to do my sit-ups and those sorts of things and when I got up my head was just suddenly killing me.  All the way down my neck.  My thought was -- oh great -- trying to get rid of the flabby knees and now I am having a stroke.  So, I got up, took some aspirin, set still and went to bed.  The next morning I was fine but I decided that maybe I was just a wee bit long in the tooth to do a long exercise session so I gave it a day or so -- a few pilates along the way -- and just rested.  I will start up again today -- slowly for sure.  I don't mind telling you that it sort of scared me and I was reminded that I am no spring chicken and I have not been on an exercise program for quite a while and perhaps using some common sense would be in order.  If I had done that, I wouldn't have lost three days to no exercise at all -- lesson learned.Cooking -- I shopped last week and cooked  for several days.  It was ok and Hubs even ate what I cooked -- novel idea, there Hubs!  Since we are both down with allergies, complete with coughs and chest congestion, I will be cooking tonight as well.  Tomorrow it is Mother's Day lunch with MIL at her place.So, that is how my challenge went this week.  It was off -- I was off -- but I did learn something.  Clearly the dieting issues was enlightening and so was the fact that I just don't have the personality to adhere to a strict moment to moment schedule.  I didn't get the Bible study first thing most mornings but I did get it done.  I didn't get the laundry done first thing in the morning but I did get it done.  I had to regroup due to not being at home for a couple of days but that was ok.  I have learned that flexibility is key -- set your goals and go about meeting them but if you have to shift things around that is ok, too.  So, this was truly a week of learning a lot about myself and that is always a good thing. Sorry this was so long, I am certain not many people want to hear about my struggle with laundry to listening to my tummy talk to me but this is a way of keeping me on track.  Aren't you glad it is only once a week?"},
{"title": "Friday Finds", "date": "Friday, May 06, 2016", "text": "Jenn over at Books and a Beat hosts Friday Finds -- a meme of books you might have found over the course of the week and would like to share.  It doesn't matter where you found these books --the library, big box book store, indie bookstore, the back of your closet and it doesn't matter what form -- physical book, e-book, audio book -- just a book.So, here are my finds for this week.  I have been reading lots of M. C. Beaton and Nancy Atherton and have fallen in love with cozy mysteries.  I decided this week to seek out some of the other offerings so I headed to my neighborhood Half Price Books. With the upcoming Hallmark movie starring Alison Sweeney based on the  Hannah Swensen cookie jar mysteries by Joanne Fluke, I chose the first in the series Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder.  I haven't started it yet but want to read it before I see the movie. My two reservations about this book are the font size -- I have been reading on my e-reader and my eyes are spoiled.  I thought about buying e-books but these used books are so much cheaper and I will donate them to my granddaughter's Girl Scout book project which is ongoing throughout the year.  The second reservation is hunger -- I am afraid these are going to make me hungry for things I shouldn't be eating.As I was looking at the Joanne Fluke books I found one that isn't a cozy at all but it looks to be more of a ghost story.  It is called The Other Child.  The cover reminds me of The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson and we all know I am a sucker for book covers.Then, the last discovery is The Diva Runs Out of Thyme by Krista Davis.  This is the first her domestic diva series.  I am not all that dometic so I don't know how it will go but again with the cover \"issue\".Honestly, I didn't exactly just \"run across\" these books -- I went looking for them.  Again, not sure if I will wish I had bought e-books (Nooks are so easy to read while riding in a car!) but I am looking forward to reading them anyway.So, those are my Friday Finds! I will review when I am done."},

{"title": "Lucy Has Arrived", "date": "Wednesday, May 04, 2016", "text": "As I promised, Lucy has arrived. Her proper name is Lucy Lemur.  She is sleek, smooth, sort of shiny and is mine, all mine.  I know the suspense is overwhelming so I won't keep you waiting any longer --TA-DA!No, Pom Pom, I am sorry -- not a kitten but I am so happy to have Lucy here as my other computer has a broken power cord slot and it just needed to be replaced as I am sure it would cost more to fix it than the computer cost to begin with. So, that is why I have been absent for several days because in order for the little computer to work I had to hold the power cord just the right way and I could only hold on to it for so long before my hand cramped and that was the end of my efforts.So, from now on my compelling posts will be composed with Lucy's help here in my little corner of the world.My little corner of the world is a home office armoire.  It is made to house a desktop computer with a CPU and such but it is working just fine for me.  My  husband decided to go back to a desk he used previously so I fell heir to this cabinet.  We were trying to move it out of the house altogether but it turned out to be such a bear to move that we just adjusted the furniture to accommodate it in the entry way.  So, it is now mine.To the right you can see my planner with a bright colored paisley design on it.  It is proving to be very useful -- who know in my old age I would actually use a planner? Hmmm.Behind it you will see a little terracotta pot with pencils in it.  When my father was undergoing radiation treatment there was another man doing the same and his wife would come with him.  She was a ceramicist and, knowing my dad was an artist, she made him this little little pot to hold paint brushes.  When my dad passed away and we were clearing out his apartment this was the one thing I was desperate to hold on to.  To be such a little thing, it means so much.On the left you can see my purple prayer journal with my life plan in it.  I need to be a little more proactive with that.In the back left there is a little lamp with a little story.  Once, in our very first house, we had an old chest of drawers that my husband got from his grandmother.  We painted it white and put it in our hallway. The hallway was dark so I wanted a lamp on it but since that was the pathway for my small children, I didn't want anything large or particularly breakable and I thought something whimsical would be fun.  So, I sent Hubs out of find \"something\" and he came back with one of those little blue, speckled enamel ware coffee pots and a lamp was born.  In order to make it a little heavier he filled it with gravel from one area of our yard.  The lamp has moved with us to two other houses and has been through several paint jobs.  This last look is black with an antiqued rusty finish peeking through -- my handiwork I might add.  It is still filled with Schmeltzer Lane, San Antonio, Texas gravel.  I will keep this little lamp forever.  The little white chest of drawers, however, was remade into a green bookcase discussed in a previous post from awhile ago.On the back bulletin board you can see a letter from Caroline, a list of neighborhood residents, doctor appointment list, a couple of meaningful cartoons.  One of them is the last King Aroo newspaper panel which was published on April 17, 1987.  The artist is Jack Kent, a friend of my father.  Here is King Aroo --I loved King Aroo.  The other is a panel of For Better or Worse and the subject matter is traveling for hours to see your daughter dance for two minutes -- something I can identify with completely.  There are also some special cards that make me smile when I see them.So, that is Lucy, my new companion and a little tour of my little corner of the world."},
{"title": "Sad Day", "date": "Saturday, April 30, 2016", "text": "Well, I thought the morning would be better.  Yesterday was sad.  The day before yesterday was sad.  I thought I would have put it all into perspective by this morning but not so. Having a bad day is one thing.  We all do it.  Sometimes they just come out of the blue.  You wake up and things are fine and then something happens and it is officially a bad day.  It doesn't even have to be something big. However, my cousin's daughter had to schedule her official bad day, and that is putting it so mildly it is almost insulting.  Today she gets to disconnect her husband's ventilator.  I have had to do this and it is the most gut wrenching thing that I have ever had to do.  My thoughts and prayers are with her and her family today.  Death is hard -- doing what she has to do is harder.And then, there is Bruce.  Bruce isn't doing well.  The radiation treatment helped but the chemo has not.  The tumor has grown and spread.  They have been looking for another clinical trial but he doesn't fit the criteria.  Apparently most clinical trials require that the patient has at least 16 weeks to live and they meet certain physical ability standards.  He does neither.  Hospice has been called in and the hope is that they can just take him home to wait out the next 4 to 5 weeks that he is on this earth.There are just no words for the overwhelming sadness."},

{"title": "Oh Dear -- I Have Nothing to Talk About", "date": "Wednesday, April 27, 2016", "text": "Well, what a day -- I have nothing to blog about.  I have working on my life plan as laid out in my Simple Living Challenge posts but I have had a couple of off days.  That is normal and the goal is not to stress or just give up but get back on track and keep moving forward.  I had a great aunt named Willie who, when learning to drive couldn't back up and her mantra became \"just keep going forward\" and that is what I am trying to do.I am learning a lot about things with this challenge -- mostly that I need to get up earlier and get a few things done before the day actually starts.  I get up before Hubs and I like to do the Bible study then when it is really quiet.  I can concentrate better.  I have been doing my exercises stretched out across the day which, in one way is good, but in another it seems like all I am doing is exercising! So, I need to tweak my schedule a bit and possibly just do an exercise time.  However, I think by stretching it out I have kept myself from getting sore.I did get up and go grocery shopping -- a proper grocery shopping -- yesterday in anticipation of the horrific storms that we were predicted for last night.  I bought enough to keep us going for a week and.....the thunderstorm lasted for about 30 minutes with little fanfare.  I find it useless to watch the local weather anymore -- they are all drama queens and most times they are wrong.  Anyway, yesterday when I got home I put pork chops in the crock pot to be ready when we got home from picking up Bean and tonight I think I am going to make some taco meat.  Or maybe just make a hamburger when I get home.  I have options!Hubs and I are involved in the Sunday School program at our church so we have been helping to build things for that.  It is great fun.  I am also thinking of something to do as a service project for me.  I am not hugely talented and I am a bit of an introvert so I am not going to go out and make waves in the world.  However, I do quilt and I was thinking that making baby quilts for charity would be good.  Our church has an alliance with the Fort Worth Pregnancy Center and I was thinking that they might appreciate some homemade quilts for their clients.  I make simple, utilitarian quilts that are meant to be snuggled and washed an dragged around and I have enough fabric to probably go around the world and I can't think of a better use to put it to.  Anyway, that is what I have been thinking about the last couple of days.I am reading a book called \"Bright Young Things\".  It is the story of Letty and Cordelia in 1920's New York.  It is a fun book and it going quickly.  I have been working toward reading down the queue on my Nook.  I have resisted the urge to put anything new on it until I read some of what I have.  In fact, I have been doing a good job of not buying new books at all recently.  I think that is because all the bookstores that were near me have closed down so I have farther to go to get to one.  I have read that B&N is going to re-open some stores although they are going to a smaller footprint.  I just wish we had some independent stores left -- they are supposed to open one downtown but I haven't heard much about it.Well, anyway, as I said, I really have nothing to blog about so I guess I will quit this rambling and go do something.  Guess I could put the meat on to cook -- crock pot taco meat is really good."},
{"title": "Simple Living Challenge", "date": "Saturday, April 23, 2016", "text": "This has been the second week of my participation in Simple Living Challenge hosted by Jenn at adailyrhythym.com.My went progressed at such --The Word -- still reading each day -- have decided to alternate Old Testament and New Testament so I am half way through Matthew.  I gave up using the Nook -- it is too difficult because my Nook seems to be touchy and is giving me problems -- so back to The Book I go.  I am finding this reading to be very relaxing.  I don't know if that is an appropriate thing to say or not but it is.Exercise -- Ok, I am doing pretty well in this department.  I have ridden my exercise bike 150 minutes - that is 30 minutes a day for five days.  It hasn't been that regular though because I missed three days instead of two and then rode more minutes twice -- I am up to 45 minutes per day.  The reason I missed a couple of days was because of doctor's appointments and such and some time dealing with my mother in law.  My goal is 30 minutes per day which is 210 minutes a week.  Since I have upped my minutes at each go I might actually surpass that but I have been advised by my doctor to take a day off -- and he is right.  I am still doing my pilates throughout the day.  It is mindless and painless if you take the few minutes you are waiting for laundry to finish or water to boil and throw in a few moves.  It adds up if you keep a talley.  And......drumroll please .... it is a stretch but I have moved up to 50 sit-ups at a time. I have done that once a day but am thinking of dividing it into two because it is straining my hips.Peace -- Again, the tv is staying off for the most part and, when it is on in the evening, we are watching something with intent.  We ditched cable several months ago and now watch network tv with added viewing pleasure supplied by a Roku.  We subscribe to Acorn (the best!) and Netflix so there is always something to watch and I have taken to watching movies that I have missed as we no longer go to movie theaters (bummer).  No longer is the tv running just for the sake of using electricity.  I feel like this goal has been nailed -- we enjoy the quiet.Food -- I have been tweaking my eating plan after starting the books \"Thin Within\" and \"Intuitive Eating\".   I haven't read very far in either book but I get it.  My plan for the last week has been -- eat three times a day, nothing in between, try for nothing after dinner, be mindful of sugar and eat slowly so that you recognize when you are full.  The idea of learning to recognize when you are hungry and when you are full requires you paying attention.  I have been following the suggestion of eating sitting down (I never ate standing up, anyway) and paying close attention to that fine moment -- that thin line -- between being satisfied and stuffed.  Eating this way frees you to eat whatever you want where ever you are.  I have been practicing this and it seems to work.  I haven't lost any weight, I don't think.  I look different though and I was reminded at he dr. yesterday that muscle weighs more than fat so as I am building muscle the numbers may not change as readily but they will as I go on.  I just know I have less throat  and one less chin.Domestic issues -- still struggling here.  Kitchen clean, things are staying tidied but as far as really cleaning -- yeah - fuggidaboutit.  But, at least things are tidy.  That is one goal reached.  Maybe subconsciously I am trying to conquer that little challenge before I move on.  At any rate, I am still working on this.Grocery shopping -- ok, still not going to the grocery store.  So, I bought a handy little check list thing for my planner.It isn't elaborate or detailed or anything but it will give me an idea of something to eat.  It is laminated and wipes clean with a damp cloth.  There is space on the back for a grocery list.  We are still eating out a lot but that is ok -- I can still use this for that as well -- it will help decide what we are going to have when.  I can already tell you -- Wednesday is Mexican food (because we are all trained at a young age in the Texas public school system that Wednesday is Mexican food day in the school cafeteria) and Friday is going to be hamburger night -- whether it is hamburgers at home or at our favorite Chapp's.  One night will have to be fish -- that should really be Friday in keeping with religious beliefs -- but I have to find a night for Hubs to have his shrimp.  So hamburgers may be Monday night.  We will see.So, that was my week living my simple living challenge.  I am taking this very seriously as I need direction in my life in some areas.  I thought that with retirement I could just throw caution to the wind and live wild and free but wild and free doesn't make for a clean house and a healthy body so here I am, in my dotage, relying on a planner and writing goals.  It is ok, though, I feel accomplished, stronger physically and more focused so even if I am not meeting my goals 100% I am trying and that is half the battle.Have a great week!"},

Our daughter, son in law and Bean were going to go for a while after Bean's golf lesson so we decided to tag along.  A childhood friend of mine was going to be there with his daughter's booth so I thought I would look him up.  As luck would have it, I missed him.  My fault because he sent me his phone number and I went off and left it at home.  I did gift him with this vintage photo of us in my yard on Lee Hall Street.  I believe it was about 1959.I did have presence of mind to take my camera with me so I thought I would share some photos of the evening.  Apparently the crowds were lighter last night, probably due to threatening weather, but it was a very good time.  I should have shopped but I didn't.  They had lovely glass items and pottery that really caught my eye and some black and white sketches.  If it wasn't pouring rain and my ankles didn't hurt so much I would venture back down there and buy one of the sketches.  The glassware and pottery was completely out of my price range.Anyway, here is a glimpse of our evening and some architectural interest shots.  I tried to do the Don Mangus thing of doing street shots but seriously, the street wasn't that interesting.BeenalinaOur starting pointcrowdsrandom shotDaughter -- I lost her in the crowd -- it was like \"Where's Waldo\"Iconic Trail Drive muralOne of my favorite old buildingsThe Geico Gecko and BeanieThe kiddos spotThe real reason we were there -- Sand Art!A little more sand artand still more -- it is a family affairdeciding on which bottle to usetaking it all intrying to be artistic but it is just wonky -- it was just beginning to get darkTarrant County CourthouseCourthouseCourthouseFree!Panther sculpture -- in addition to being called \"Cowtown' we are also called \"Panther City\"-- I think it has to do with a panther sighting back in the dayFort Worth streetOn a pillar outside the restaurantOld tile workLooking up!OrnateEvening lights shiningMore evening -- the trees all have fairy lights in them and sparkle year roundAgainEntrance to the kids areaWe then had dinner at Cantina Laredo -- yummy chicken and lime cilantro salad -- it was so large I couldn't eat it all!It was a wonderful evening, a lot of walking and good exercise, beautiful artwork and, if it wasn't raining I would go back but.....next year!"},
{"title": "A Simple Living Challenge", "date": "Saturday, April 16, 2016", "text": "As I said last week, I am following Jenn at A Daily Rhythm adailyrhythm.com as she begins a simple living challenge of her own devise.  The goal of her plan is to designate areas of her life that she wishes to improve on or develop.  I had been thinking along the same lines so I decided to join her in her journey.  Her plan is to post every Saturday about her progress and I am following suit so here I am with my progress of the last week.I chose to concentrate on six main concerns of mine in order of importance to me:  spirituality, exercise, peace, food, domestic issues, and grocery shopping.  My least favorite thing in the whole world is grocery shopping so you can see where it ended up on my list of importance.  LOL!So, here is how my week went --The Word -- this is the most important goal to me and I managed to meet it each day although it wasn't always first thing in the morning.  Most days it was as I sat in the pick up line at Bean's school.  I have started with Genesis and put a NIV study Bible on my Nook which makes the toting around a lot easier.  The reading is slow because I am trying not to just skim over the difficult names and such, I am really trying to stay focused.  However, I am on Chapter 34 so progress is being made.Exercise -- ok, my goal was 30 minutes a day on my exercise bike and I have accomplished that 5 out of the seven days.  With that said, I am also incorporating some pilates that I used to do in college and I am finding myself doing some of that while I am waiting for the tea water to boil or the washer to stop.  It is doing wonders for the achy knees, btw -- I wish I had started this a long time ago.Peace -- the tv has been off the entire week until noon when we watch the news and a soap opera.  Then it goes off again until late evening and I notice it has been coming on later and later.  We only watch two shows regularly and we seem to be liking the quiet.  So, I would say I have accomplished that goal. Plus, I have gotten really tired of the politics.Food -- ok, I bought the two books that Jenn recommended -- \"Thin Within\" and \"Intuitive Eating\".  I think I have read them both in the past but need to read them again.  I haven't started yet but will probably get to that today.  As far as my eating went -- well -- improvement needs to be made.  I did ok for the most part being mindful of what I was eating and when I was eating.  I didn't snack a whole lot but there was some.  However, it wasn't mindless, it was intentional.  The thing I can't get past is sugar and that is what I desperately need to conquer.  So, this upcoming week I am going to do a better job of being cognisant of the sugar intake.  I really don't want to go back to food journaling but I will if I have to, just to get my head around things. Domestic Issues -- ok, now things start to slide a bit.  I am behind on the laundry but catching up this morning.  I haven't done a lick of housework except to try to keep the kitchen clean and I have been doing a reasonable job of that.  My excuse?  Well, MIL was admitted to the hospital on Monday and then immediately released to a rehab and we have been doing a lot of running back and forth for that.  And, I had a doctor appointment as well.  Not a really good reason, I get it, but these things did mess up the flow of my day.Grocery shopping -- I haven't done a good grocery shopping all week.  We have stopped for a few things along the way which was good -- we have a new Spouts just up the street and I love it -- so small, organic and great meat.  We eat out a lot which is bad but when we get home in the evening neither one of us really want to cook and we don't like the same foods so there you go.  I did cook my easy, simple steak dinner again and Hubs liked it.  I had put some potatoes to bake in the crock pot and then sauteed some asparagus as the steaks grilled on the stove.  I have been watching a lot of Jacques Pepin and love the way he makes cooking look so effortless.  I wish I could cook like him or....just hire him.  Ha!So, that was my week of simple living.  I am going to continue on this path next week and try to get my head around the cooking a bit more.  I have a few simple meals up my sleeve (hint: tonight will probably be omelets or grilled cheese sandwiches).Oh, yes, I almost forgot.  I ordered an Erin Condren planner -- having been sucked in by my daughter and cousin -- but I really do need to write things down.  I thought when we retired life would be one big, carefree, white fluffy cloud sort of floating existence. Boy, was I wrong.  You better have your wits well honed because before you know it here comes health issues, medicare, social security, supplementals, phone calls, notes scribbled on discarded envelopes -- yes, in other words -- something I like to call ElderChaos.  So, I decided to purchase the much recommended planner in an effort to keep all this retirement delight in some sort of order.  My husband usually handles this but lately they have been wanting to talk to me since most of the calls are about me and besides, he is the worst about the note taking so here I go -- acquainting myself with the geriatric equivalent of a college planner.  Yay!Anyway, I thought I would share photos -- I didn't take any of the inside but let me assure you - it is roomy with lots of space to write and I am thinking it would be useful for meal planning as well if I actually resort to REALLY meal planning. I know it will be useful for keeping track of my exercise.Even the box is prettyclassyvoila!So, that was my Simple Living Challenge for this week.  Hopefully I will have more progress next week.This is the story of Patrick and Maggie.  Patrick is an American businessman in Ireland on.. well.. business.  He is married with two children.  Maggie runs an inn and is unmarried. They meet, she isn't impressed with the \"Yank\", she becomes impressed, things progress.  Promises are made, Patrick goes home and promises are kept.  Things aren't the same and apparently haven't been for about a year, unbeknownst to him.  Twenty years pass.  History repeats itself.  Happiness is found.Russ Durbin's writing is wonderful.  It seems to be written by a person with a business background -- a nod, I am sure, to the main male character.  The prose flows without flourish or grandeur.  It is very matter of fact.  However, rather than reading an account of the happenings, the reader feels like he/she is watching.  It is very good writing.It isn't a long book -- a little less than 300 pages -- and it reads so smoothly and progresses so well that it goes way too fast.  This is one of those books that you wish there was a sequel but a sequel would actually spoil it.  It is perfect as it is.I recommend."},
{"title": "A Vintage Affair by Isabel Wolff", "date": "Tuesday, April 12, 2016", "text": "A few days ago I was scrolling through the offerings on my Nook and ran across this book.  I had started it a couple of times but somehow got distracted and never got very far.  As I am trying to read down some of the books on my device I decided to start at the top as they are arranged alphabetically and what do you know, this book was at the top so I decided to give it a go.I guess the time was right because it grabbed me immediately and I couldn't put it down.It is the story of Phoebe Swift and her friend Emma.  They met as children and grew up together -- their lives would be forever intertwined and the events that occurred made up the central focus of the novel.  However, there were several subplots -- all as developed as the central plot -- and all of them captivating.It was phenomenal how this book flowed -- there were no glitches or awkward segues between the storylines, nothing was contrived.  It was lovely.It would be too involved to go into the story itself but it is definitely one of the best books I have read in a long time.  The subject matter was gripping, there was humor and sadness and gladness and scenery.  And there was the little blue coat.I would definitely recommend this book.  I am just not sure why it took me so long to read it."},
{"title": "The Best Laid Plans of Mice and Men", "date": "Monday, April 11, 2016", "text": "often go awry.  Yes, indeed.  As I sat here this morning preparing to enjoy my tea with a bit of scripture reading as I outlined in my daily plan -- the phone rang.  I knew it wasn't my daughter as I had just spoken to her so...It was an RA from my mother in law's assisted living place.  \"Has something happened?\" I asked.  \"Yes\", the lady replied, \"Mrs. B fell this morning, hit her head, we called 911 and she has been transported to the hospital\".  We were there almost as quickly as she was. That was at 8 a.mShe was quickly assessed and it was determined she sustained no injury and didn't need to be in a hospital but she needed to be someplace so the caseworker was called in and plans were made to sign her into an aggressive rehabilitation hospital.  We left to gather her things and within two hours she had been moved.Hubs went to deliver her belongings, I went to pick up Bean.  We met up for dinner and then went back to the Rehab to take more things and check on the MIL.She will be there for 14 days and then reassessed. I am tired and no, my  today didn't exactly go as planned.  I did get my scripture reading done in the car waiting for Bean but I haven't gotten my exercise done and there was no thought to laundry.  Guess I will begin again tomorrow.*Sigh*"},
{"title": "Simple Living Challenge", "date": "Saturday, April 09, 2016", "text": "Today is the first day of my Simple Living Challenge hosted by Jenn at ADailyRhythm.com.  My plan is different that hers slightly but reading over hers I think she has some good ideas, mostly in the form of housekeeping.So, my goals are:1.  Putting spiritual things first -- the first little while of my day will be spent with tea and The Word.  I have done this this morning already and I feel good about it.  Since I have never read the Bible all the way through I decided to start at the logical start place -- Genesis.  I am reading a few chapters at a time in an easy to read format -- Women's Devotional Bible by Zondervan.  I am not striving for a goal of a certain amount per day -- just reading until it feels right.2.  Exercise.  I am aiming for 30 minutes of dedicated exercise a day.  I have already ridden my exercise bike for 30 minutes this morning and hopefully I will feel more energized over the course of the day.3.  Less noise pollution.  The tv has yet to come on.4.  Food -- eating intuitively.  I am going to purchase the books suggested by Jenn (for some reason I think I have one of them but can't find it -- maybe I need to KonMarie my books!)  Anyway, I am going to start studying them.  However, yesterday I said I was going to eat three meals a day with no snacks.  I am going to change that and allow a mid morning something to go with tea.  I can do fine from lunch to supper but I get up so early that I almost always need a little break -- hopefully something healthy.  I started thinking about kindergarten and we always got a snack in kindergarten -- even just half day kinder so I am thinking something small with my mid-morning cuppa will be ok if I am mindful.5.  Domestic issues -- I have been looking at Jenn's organization of her chores and I am thinking about mine.  I will continue to do laundry on a daily basis -- I absolutely have to do that in order to keep up with it.  My husband seems to change his clothes A LOT! And the kitchen is an ever ongoing project but that is ok -- I would rather be on top of it.   The rest of it -- well, I think I am over thinking the whole thing.  I am going to pick a day to do each chore -- bathrooms, dust, and vacuum.  Vacuuming is my least favorite thing to do so I think I will do it on Friday to be ready for anybody who might drop by on the weekend. Bathrooms on Friday as well.  I live in Texas and we could dust every hour on the hour but I think I will choose to do it another day -- maybe Wednesday.6.  Grocery shopping -- I believe I will grocery shop for the week on Monday.  I remember my mother liking to go on Monday because they were stocking fresh for the week or on Friday but I think I will try Monday on to see if it works ok for me.Ok, so that is my new plan.  Now I have to figure out a way to be accountable without boring everybody with a post about whether I clean the bathroom or not.  Maybe a side bar.  I have purchased a new planner that will be here soon and I will probably just keep track of things there and report in here each Saturday.Anyway, I have begun and actually, the two most important things to me have been accomplished already today so I would say I have done ok and off to a good start.  Hopefully I can keep it up!By the way -- I had a lovely simple dinner last night and my husband actually liked it.  I grilled two little New York strip steaks on my new cast iron grill plan, made a salad and roasted some new potatoes.  It was good and didn't take long at all to do so that was a win as well.  Tonight I am off to the Girl Scout sleep over and he is on his own.  Hahah! He will be eating out I am sure."},
{"title": "Simple Living Challenge", "date": "Friday, April 08, 2016", "text": "For some time I have been reading a blog by Jenn (adailyrhythm.com).  She hostesses several reading memes such as Musing Mondays, Teaser Tuesday and Friday Finds.  I have participated in all of the memes at one time or another and found them to be fun, informative and intellectual.  A few months back Jenn decided she wanted to take her blog in another direction but didn't want to abandon her dedicated followers so she split the blog into two separate blogs -- A Daily Rhythm and Books and a Beat.  I still follow both.In the last few days Jenn has been moving toward a new concentration in her blog A Daily Rhythm and has introduced a challenge called Simple Living Challenge.  When I read her post about this challenge the concept rang such a bell for me that I was immediately taken in wanted to participate.For the last couple of years I have been looking for something different in my life.  A different way to \"be\".  I didn't know how to express it but Jenn has done a wonderful job of putting my thoughts into her words.  I have explored \"minimalism\" and while I think it is great, in a way, I can't only have 33 pieces of clothing and two plates.  I have explored all the ecological pathways to a cleaner/healthier home while saving the planet.  I do try but I am getting older and there are just some things I have to do to save my sanity and my energy -- like run the clothes dryer.  All of these ideas that I have been trying on have their good points -- great points -- actually but it isn't a one size fits all sort of thing.Jenn's idea does work for everybody because you examine your needs and desires (not using any other parameter than your own) and you make your plan.  She lists her needs and desires and outlines her approach and has created the blog challenge to keep herself accountable.  Her approach involves faith and spirituality which I personally believe has to be the basis for everything we do.  She also embraces the teachings of Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch, authors of \"Intuitive Eating\" and Judy and Arthur Halliday authors of \"Thin Within\".  She is looking at ways to attack the chores she doesn't enjoy doing and being able to have time for the things she does enjoy doing.So, while I have learned to fold my underwear correctly and find joy in the things around me thanks to Marie Kondo, I am looking for something else and I think Jenn may have hit on it.  In a way, I feel like it is returning to life in another time -- more like my youth.  Jenn is eons younger than I am so she probably doesn't see it but her proposal is more like life was when I was growing up -- women had a simpler life back then and what Jenn is proposing is very reminiscent of that.  The difference is back then it was just life, now it is intentional.So, I am setting my goals now for what are my immediate life needs and desires and my long term goals.The Word  I have always been a church going believer but I have never been strong in Bible reading.  My goal is to begin my day in the Word and prayer.  I know it will set the tone for my day.Peace  I yearn for a more peaceful existence.  I remember growing up when there was no technology and television was a novelty not a necessity.  I remember waking up to the breeze blowing through the organdy criss-cross curtains and hearing the birds chirp.  It was peaceful.  I want to feel that feeling again therefore, the television will remain off except for the couple of shows that we watch and the computer time will be limited.  I don't have a smart phone that has become like another appendage so that isn't a problem.Food I have a weight problem.  I have had one for a very long time.  I have accepted that I come from a long line of family members who were not particularly small.  However, I believe that Americans have developed such an unhealthy attitude toward food that almost everybody could be classified as having an eating disorder.  I remember my pediatrician telling my mother that my diet should consist of all things in moderation.  He never said only eat plants or never eat eggs or anything sweet is taboo.  He said all things in moderation.  Of course, fast food wasn't readily available back then, either. The question has come up recently whether the food was better in that era than now, safer so to speak, and while my daughter thinks it was I am not so sure.  Remember, we were the generation that had DDT sprayed liberally in the streets to combat polio.  So, in all honesty, I can't say that farming practices back in the 50's were any safer.  But, my goal is to have a healthy diet that includes all things in moderation (except milk -- can't do milk anymore) with an eye to the healthiest, whole organic foods I can afford. I will eat three meals a day and try to not eat in between meals.  I will no longer try to keep a food diary.  It is boring and only makes me grumpy and I think it leads to bad eating habits.  My mother never kept a food diary but she did eat intuitively -- if she ate potatoes at a meal she never ate bread -- that sort of thing.Exercise  I will be working toward at least 30 minutes of dedicated exercise a day and I will wear my pedometer to get an idea of how active I am in general.  I have a Jawbone fitness tracker but it gets in my way so I don't wear it anymore.  It is hard to wash dishes with it on and if I take it off I forget to put it back.  So, it is more of a liability than an asset.Chores  I have been working on this for a while now.  I don't like housework but apparently nobody but me is going to do it so......I have developed a plan that works for me.  It is a little helter skelter so I am going to try to make a more designated plan but this is what I am doing now.  I tire easily so doing \"big\" things just isn't easy for me anymore. I do laundry every day.  They are small loads which I am sure is really lousy for the planet but it is better for me -- selfish thing that I am.  I have an HE machine and I make my own laundry soap so that should account for something.  I start out the day putting in a load of laundry, drying it and putting it away.  An empty laundry hamper is very gratifying to me! I try to keep the kitchen clean as I go.  I like to start out the day with a clean sink, empty dishwasher and empty dish drainer.  As the day progresses I will either wash the dishes by hand or put them in the dishwasher.  My husband hasn't gotten the hang of this yet and I am still finding bowls sitting on the counter but he is a good man so I will forgive him and put them in the dishwasher myself but it is a never ending battle since he retired.  Just sayin'.  I have found that running the swiffer over the furniture or swiffering the floors on a daily basis goes a long way to keeping the housework to a minimum and it really only takes a few minutes.  It takes longer to complain about it and avoid it than it does to actually do it.  Can you eat off my floors? I wouldn't recommend it but I am getting to the point that I don't have to go into a panic if somebody drops by for a chat that my house should be on an episode of \"The Hoarders\".Meal Planning I took home economics in junior high school.  I had this dreadful little teacher named Mrs. Chappell.  I thought she had to be at least ten years older than God.  My MOTHER had her at the same school for goodness sakes! She had to be ancient.  Truth is, I have done a genealogical search for her and when I had her she wasn't old at all, in her 40's.  Whatever.  I remember that class very well and I remember her teaching us to meal plan.  She must not have ever changed her ways because what she taught was exactly how my mother did it and how I find myself thinking when I try to plan.  The idea was a meat, a starch, two veg or a veg and a salad, fruit, bread and a beverage.  This is how I still plan my meals although we don't eat nearly that much food.  Maybe we should.  If we did maybe my husband wouldn't be back in the kitchen a half hour after dinner looking for something to eat! In any event, I can't menu plan.  It doesn't work for me because whatever I plan for, say, Monday I can guarantee you that when Monday comes I won't want that.  So, I try to buy enough meat for a week, have enough starches on hand and enough vegetables to make meals for a week.  I went to the store yesterday to buy food for a week and see what I could do.  We went out to dinner, which we do on a regular basis, but I have enough food for several meals and we are going to see how it goes.  We will be eating at home tonight.  The problem I have with food is that my husband doesn't like my cooking.  I am not kidding.  He really doesn't.  I like plain food.  I don't like it messed around with.  I am not a \"sauce\" person and he absolutely hates casseroles.  So, I am all about boiled potatoes and steamed veg.  I love it.  He doesn't.  It is difficult.  So, I am trying this new idea that since he is the restaurant lover -- we will do his way a couple of days a week and my way the rest of the week.  Sounds fair, right?clothing I am devising a 'uniform' -- I will get back to you on this but it reminds me of Flylady -- getting dressed to the shoes.   So, all of this culminates in Saturday being the day of accountability. Jenn intends to blog about her Simple Life Challenge on Saturdays and I intend to join her.  I doubt mine will be as wordy as this post has been -- just a brief overview of the week -- honestly abounding -- to see if I have met my goals.If you would like to join just visit Jenn at adailyrhythm.com to see what she has going on.  She is a lovely young woman with a strong faith and a good attitude.  I enjoy her blogs and I would recommend them to anybody.So, until tomorrow --"},
{"title": "This 'n' That and a Book Review", "date": "Wednesday, April 06, 2016", "text": "Yesterday I completed M.C. Beaton's \"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell\". I have read several of these little cozies and really like them.  I sort of identify with grumpy Agatha -- except for her love of high heels.  I have only read one of these books that I just didn't like but not this one.  I loved the way this one ended up -- I won't tell you - but let's just say that James Lacey's turn of events was totally unexpected.  I can't wait to start the next one but in the interim I am reading \"A Vintage Affair\".  I have started it several times and then got distracted but am determined to finish it this time.  It isn't that it doesn't hold my interest -- it does -- but something keeps stopping me.  I am reading it on my Nook.I have finally given up trying to decide whether physical books are better than electronic books.  At the end of the day it just doesn't matter.  I really like reading in the car and the e-reader works better for that than traditional books so I guess I have to just adjust to the environment. Dealing with medicare and supplemental insurance and drug insurance is a pain.  A big one.  I have just been through the process for drug insurance yet again.  They told me I was covered. Apparently I wasn't.  I don't deal with this stuff.  My husband does.  He needs something to keep him busy, doesn't he?  So, we made a phone call but the guy at the insurance company wanted to hear my voice -- he needed to talk to me.  Blah, blah, blah.  After an hour it was determined that I was, indeed, not covered and we started the whole process over again.  Such fun.I read lots of blogs.  One that I read from time to time stated that the lady who writes it is considering stopping.  She outlined how much time it took to write it, to answer all the comments, the deal with the people sponsoring her. She talked about how much planning goes into the writing, planning the blog sugjects, outlining, doing research.  One thing is clear -- I am doing it all wrong.  Maybe that is why nobody reads my blog.  I thought it was just a place for me to chat -- mostly to myself.  I didn't realize.  I am sorry.And then.....I follow a group on FB about hand quilting.  They have \"themes\" once in a while.  This past week the theme was \"pets and quilts\".  People posted photos of their pets with their quilts, on their quilts, next to their quilts -- you get the picture.  Some of these quilts are gorgeous and so are some of the pets....I think....I didn't really pay too much attention to the animals.  So, after this went on for a bit one lady decided to become grumpy and made some sort of statement about stopping with the pets already and get back to quilting.  She offended a lot of people.  Then there was a fight.  Is it just me or has the world gone mad?  Who cares if somebody lets their cat get on the quilt?  Who cares if somebody posts a picture of a quilt with a dog laying tummy up on the quilt.  I mean -- ANGRY?  Really?  Isn't life a bit too short for that or do I just not have the energy or interest in things anymore.  I don't get it.  It seems like being offended has become the Great American Pastime!  If people would look at their time like it was money they could equate complaining on a social media site to throwing their money out the window of a fast moving car.  Personally, my time is really important to me and I am not going to waste it arguing with people I don't even know on an insignificant place like the internet.  Ok, the internet isn't really insignificant but you know what I mean -- if you are going to fight, at least do it face to face with somebody you know.I feel very  O                   L                     D.I made a new chicken recipe last night.  I got it from my daughter only I used a crock pot while she baked it in the oven.  I am sure hers turned out better than mine but it wasn't bad.  You take boneless chicken breasts, put them in a dish and pour balsamic salad dressing over it and top with shaved parmesan cheese.  It had a great flavor.  I served it with rice and sauteed green beans.  I enjoyed it but I was starving so who knows.  There was a lot left over so that is lunch.We have been thinking about taking a vacation.  We don't really vacation but we were at least thinking about it.  Places that have been mentioned are Charleston, SC, Asheville, NC, Eureka Springs, AR, Oklahoma City, OK, Austin, TX, and just a staycation here -- doing things we keep saying we are going to do and never do -- you know, things that are right under our nose.  We will see.I have also been exploring the world of planners.  I used to do Daytimers when my kids were young and my husband travelled and I cared for my parents but since my life has changed from all of that I haven't really felt the need.  Now, however, I am thinking I need to go back to a planner to keep up with all these ridiculous, annoying phone calls with health care professionals and insurance companies and such.  We seem to think we are going to remember or we scribble things down on scraps of paper and then lose it so I think I am going to have to re-think this aspect of my \"homekeeping\".  I am looking at the Erin Condren planners -- pricey but seem workable. Maybe something like one of these - If I buy I will share photos. Ok, well, time to close this incredibly boring post.  It is putting me to sleep.  Will be back soon"},
{"title": "I Can't Believe --", "date": "Tuesday, April 05, 2016", "text": "it has been so long since my last post! I can't even tell you what I have been doing really -- nothing particularly blog worthy for sure -- but the time has just escaped me.Let's see -- my last post was raving about technology and I am still raving about technology.  I think my computer is going to give up the ghost soon and I am not sure about a replacement.  I have a little 10\" netbook and those seem to be going the way of the dinosaurs.  We don't run Windows as my husband prefers Linux so we have Ubuntu installed on everything so I will need to find a replacement that he can make the change to.  Or I can by one already loaded with Ubuntu but it is a larger laptop and I am not sure I like that.  I am very used to sitting with my little computer on my lap in front of the television -- talk about the extreme of laziness!  So, I might would have to go to my desk which is ok -- I can still see the television! Ha! I am such a sloth.  So, anyway, I am sure that computer hunting is in my future.What else -- oh yes, Easter.  We had a very lovely Easter.  The weather was a little cool but that is the norm here in TX.  We hosted dinner on Easter evening -- ham, potato salad, beans, cole slaw and cupcakes.  We had a houseful -- mother in law, daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law and my four grandblessings.  My son was under the weather so he stayed home for some much needed sleep and I don't begrudge him of that at all.  Nathan busied himself on the computer with Gramps teaching him to play Sudoku.  Kathryn was busy doing some art and Emily was content to dump out the box of crayons and carefully put them all back in the box, just to do it again.  It was fun to watch her because it was such SERIOUS BUSINESS!   Bean had a wonderful time hunting eggs at church and was also involved in doing some art work before dinner.  It was a wonderful evening -- I can never get enough of the the babies even though they are ceasing to be babies at an alarming rate.We also had to get the car repaired from the lady down the road running into us when she ran the stop sign at the entry of our neighborhood.  We live in a gated community (mixed feelings about this) and when the gate opens there is a stop sign which absolutely nobody pays any attention to.  So, she just ran it and didn't stop until she made contact with us.  She is VERY elderly and drives this BIG red cadillac that I don't think she can see over the steering wheel and she wasn't driving slowly -- she moved our whole car.  So, we had to get that fixed and we had a loaner -- a very large, very uncomfortable Tahoe.  Now my husband is on a big truck kick.  He has a small truck, one that doesn't require a step stool to get into, but he is looking and we have been roaming around car lots looking -- my favorite thing to do -- NOT.We also had to have the insurance adjuster out to assess the damage to the roof in the big hailstorm we had a few days ago.  The hail was golf ball sized, came in two waves and pummelled us for an incredibly long time.  The verdict -- new roof, new gutters, window repair (didn't realize anything was broken but it is) all to the tune of $25,000 damage.  That is a drop in the bucket compared to the homes just a few blocks away.  At least the insurance pays for most of it but I really don't like getting a new roof -- those roofing nails all over are a pain. So, now, here we are -- back on our usual, non-holiday routine, and I am having a bit of a problem getting back to normal.  I had been doing very well with my new routine and now, not so much.  Ihave gone all droopy (as Bean puts it) and unmotivated.  I need to work on that.I am exercising on my new exercise bike though.  Killing, absolutely killing my knee but maybe if I do it enough it will get better.  Doubtful but...I am reading the next Agatha Raisin in my queue -- \"Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell\".  I am almost done  and am really enjoying it.  I find I read faster on a device than a book so I am zipping right along.  I have really enjoyed this series and hate to get to the end even though I have a way to go.  When I am done I will start the Hamish MacBeth series.  I have listened to one audio book but think I would enjoy reading them.  I have also purchased a collection of the George Gently books so I am looking forward to those as well.I have been working on some sewing projects but while cleaning the house for Easter I put my thimble away and can't find it.  This just reinforces my idea that to declutter your house you have to use logic.  I have looked in all the logical places and I can't find it so clearly I didn't follow my own advice when clearing up.  Bother.  I might have to go buy another.  Bother, bother.So, yes, that is all I have been up to.  Like I said, nothing blog-worthy. And, I have no photos to share.  I think I better get my act together this week -- how boring is this."},
{"title": "I Knew This Day Would Come", "date": "Thursday, March 24, 2016", "text": "When technology first became part of our lives I was skeptical.  I remember my husband and son buying our first computer.  There was no internet.  I had no interest.Then, we moved and home computers were common -- or more so at least.  I wanted one in the worst way.  We bought one, obtained internet access and I never looked back.  It was like a whole new existence.Then came things like video games and then tablets, smart phones and e-readers.  I loved it.  I stayed away from smart phones because of the radiation -- however, I now have one but don't have a data plan.  I just wanted a bigger screen.  I have had every generation of Nook that has been manufactured.The Nook is a source of aggravation to my daughter and I understand completely.  Bean loves it but my daughter is concerned about radiation emission.  So, we have had to cut Bean off and really limit her time with the device.  I was allowing her to play yesterday and she wanted to buy a new game.  She is really \"into\" these animal simulation games and I find them to be disturbing.  However, we were trying to install one and it wouldn't install.  It kept saying that there was no resource.  She cried.  I was frustrated.  I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong -- this wasn't rocket science.I came home last night and did a bit of research as to why I couldn't get anything to work.  There is was -- without one bit of fanfare or advanced warning -- Barnes and Noble has ended their app and video store.  It ended a couple of weeks ago. They also ended the ability to connect to Google Play. I received no emails or advanced notice.  It just isn't there anymore.  One article said that they would only have books and that could cease to be as well. I wonder if, after putting everybody else out of business, B&N is going to cease to be as well.So, slowly but surely my devices are becoming obsolete.  I found a way to download the games -- through the internet and google play.  I downloaded a couple of games -- PacMan and something where the chicken has to cross the road without getting run over.   However, I believe we are going to start backing out as well.  I have an ipad which the kiddo can't play with.  I have been giving thought as to whether I want to buy a kindle in case the powers that be decide they just want to do away with the Nook altogether which I guess will be the case or if I just want to go old school -- you know, real books, crossword puzzle books -- that sort of thing.Bean is going to have to face the music.  Her days are numbered on devices.  Her mother will be happy.  She will not.  However, it will be better for her as there are so many health concerns surrounding the use of such devices.I just wish they would have told us.  Nothing quite as unsettling as a Nona that can't come through.Sheesh -- what are these people thinking."},
{"title": "Politics -- Yuck", "date": "Wednesday, March 23, 2016", "text": "I am not a political person even if I was born into a political family.  My father was a newscaster so he was always watching/listening to/reading about current events.  He was an outspoken guy with lots of opinions and wasn't above spitting and sputtering and raving and ranting and using a bit of salty language when the world of politics wasn't going his way.I wasn't interested.I am still not.I am religious.  I feel like all the answers are in The Word.  However, I do live in this world so I can't avoid the all-encompassing politics.This political season has been especially nasty even though it has been entertaining.  Now, as things are winding down, I am finding it to be very troubling and a bit sinister.We have it down to five candidates -- Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, John Kasich, Ted Cruz, and Donald Trump.  I am not sure about any of them.Bernie Sanders is just an old hippie hanging on to his socialist agenda from the 60's.  He does seem to be finding a following with the young people but since I was a teenager in the 60's he is just making me feel old.  For the record -- I was never a \"hippie\"-- my hair wouldn't grow long enough and my parents weren't impressed with the movement so that took care of that.Hillary Clinton is -- well -- Hillary Clinton.  I feel that her presidency would just be in extension of her husband's presidency or her BFF PresBo's presidency.  We need to ask ourselves if we want more of the same or something different.John Kasich -- He seems to be the adult on the stage.  He seems low key and he seems to make sense.  However, he doesn't seem to be gaining much ground and I have to wonder why he is still in the game.  Would he be the best man for the job?  Possibly but he doesn't have much of a following.Donald Trump -- well, I don't need to say much here, do I?  Flamboyant? Crass? Crude? Politically incorrect or just correct?  Knowledgeable or not?  I am not sure but he certainly is stirring the pot.Ted Cruz -- ok, this is where the sinister part comes into it.  I heard some tv-speak this morning about how the whistle is going to be blown on his wife -- her antics exposed.  I couldn't even tell you what the woman looks like so I decided to do a little Google search.  Well, well, well.  Seems as though Mrs. Cruz and her hubby are in favor of a one world government and have worked toward it.Whoaaaaa! Putting on the brakes! One World Government?  I remember doing a lot of reading about that as well as the New Age Movement back when my children were in elementary school back in the late 70's and early 80's.  New Age agendas were alive and well and plaited into public school curriculum all over the place.  The more I read back then, the more frightened I became.  My children were removed from public school and life went on.  I sort of forgot about the One World Government and the New Age Movement.  It sort of disappeared into the woodwork as my life moved forward.However, like lots of things, even though it is undercover doesn't mean it is gone.  So, here it is, resurrected and rearing it's ugly head.People need to read and do their research and draw their own conclusions.  This has gone from entertaining and mildly comical to really serious business. We need to thoroughly vet out candidates and their families so we can know what they really stand for.  I have seen Cruz stand there, Bible raised in the air sounding more like a southern preacher than a presidential candidate but is that just a ruse?  Is he telling the truth?  I won't even bring up the birther issue here -- his association with this new age, one world order community is a lot more important to me than his mother's birthplace. Read people, read.  Research.  Some of it will be inaccurate but read it anyway.  The truth will suss out.  This election is probably more important than any in my lifetime.  We should approach it with knowledge and make our choices appropriately.Just sayin'.  Off the soap box now."},
{"title": "Happy St. Patrick's Day!", "date": "Thursday, March 17, 2016", "text": "Happy St. Patrick's Day! I really like St. Patrick's Day -- I never decorate or bake green cookies or drink green beer but it is an opportunity for me to remember my Irish roots and look at cute little pictures like the one above.I am a member of the Conn family. Here is a young photo of my 2nd great grandfather -- Henry Patrick Conn with one of his young sons -- Elisha, I believe.Here is an older version of 2nd great grandfather, Henry Patrick -- the young boy on the right is my grandfather, Aaron Patrick Boyett, Sr.  The little girl is Aaron Patrick's sister -- pretty little thing, isn't she?I never knew much about this family, never heard much about them until I started doing family history and discovered these lovely photos.  I have met cousins through the Ancestry.com DNA project and it is all very interesting.Our St. Patrick's Day started early -- about 4 a.m. -- with a raging hail storm.  It hailed for quite sometime  and when it was over I went back to bed, settled in, got back to sleep and wouldn't you know, it started all over again.  Our cars sit out because -- well, I can't talk about it -- so I am sure they are pretty messed up.  I would be surprised if they weren't because some of this hail was golf ball sized. It was big enough to set the car alarm off -- and lots of wind as well.  We will be inspecting the roof later as well.  Yesterday was fun though, even though my allergies were escalating and my throat was killing me.  We went to the Cowgirl Hall of Fame Museum and it was great fun.  I had never been there and I enjoyed it immensely.I did discover that my daughter, even though she enjoys country music is not one bit cowgirl.  This was no surprise.  But I did enjoy seeing all the Roy Rogers and Dale Evans displays and there was a special exhibit of the movie \"Lonesome Dove\" -- I am going to pull the DVD out and watch it again.  Nothing like a little Robert Duvall.  I really wish they would have let us take photos because there was a lot to share -- I especially liked the Annie Oakley exhibit.  As is common with these sorts of exhibits, I was aware of how small she was.I might add that the gift shop was great but very pricey.  So, I came home with nothing.  I  guess I will be having more Benadryl for my morning snack even though I feel like I am a bit better than I was yesterday.  As I said on FB -- if the rain didn't wash the pollen away I am sure the hail beat it into submission.In honor of the day I thought I would show you a couple of things that are a daily part of my life that sort of represent my attachment to all things Celtic --My first quilt attempt twenty years ago.  Machine pieced, hand quilted -- green Irish Chain.On my 40th wedding anniversary we were in Austin at a store called Things Celtic.  I wanted a new claddagh ring -- I have a James Avery one but I wanted a band so my husband bought me this one for our anniversary.  Mine is silver. I wish I had the gold one.  Or maybe one with diamonds! I love Claddagh rings.Have a wonderful St. Paddy's Day! For me, I am going to go out and look for that pot of gold -- surely there is a rainbow out there somewhere after all this rain."},
{"title": "Help!", "date": "Monday, March 14, 2016", "text": "Today was the day -- ok, today is still the day -- be positive, Melissa! Today the closet was the target of my merciless decluttering attempt.  I have failed miserably.  I might have to blame it on the time change -- I have been a little \"off\" today.  But, I can't even get started!I guess I should Marie Kondo it but I don't want to drag everything out and dump it on the floor so I will have to have an abbreviated event.  I have a nice size closet in my laundry room that I used to hang the ironing until I could get around to it! Ha! I can tell you how well that worked for me -- the ironing never got done and I recently moved the clothes that I hadn't worn in about 5 years into my closet.  Now I can't get anything else in the closet and I need to be brutally honest with myself -- am I ever going to wear those clothes that have been hanging out in the ironing closet for years?  Probably not.  But I can't make myself put them in a bag for give away.  Somebody come and help me -- please.I have managed to get laundry done -- completely -- this morning and the kitchen has been scrubbed down.  I just need to get to the closet.  Blah.  Maybe after lunch.For the last several days I have been having skin issues.  I have had rosacea in the past and am having a little flare up now.  I think I mixed too many products and just got my skin irritates.  So, I was in Beauty Brands looking for rosewater as Central Market didn't have any and a lady came up and asked me what I was looking for, I explained and she directed me to this product.The lady told me that I can use it as a regular moisturizer every day and that it will help the inflammation as well.  She was right.  I have used it for a couple of days and it has calmed down the flare up and it is truly moisturizing.  I used it before bed last night and I woke up with it still working.  So, I think this might be my new moisturizer. While I was there talking to a young salesgirl I noticed she had really lovely skin.  Of course, she was not much more than twelve -- I told her that and she laughed. So, she was a jobber for a line of products called True Isaac Mizrahi.  She led me over to the display and we chatted about how us fair skinned gals have problems getting makeup matched.  She told me she could match me and by golly, she did!It matches my skin perfectly, is mineral based and contains no parabens.  I used it for the first time yesterday and it was wonderful.  It didn't sink into fine lines which I have many and it lasted all day.  I will be going back for more of their products.   Both of these products are things I would never have taken a second look at if I hadn't had direction.  I usually stay with what I know but, unfortunately, I think my new Bare Escentuals BB primer with sunscreen is what has gotten my skin all flared up.  I am allergic to some types of sunscreen and I think that is what happened.  So much for my $35 purchase.  I will probably return.  Bother.So, I guess I will go back to the closet.  Oh, wait, it is almost lunchtime! Yay! Maybe I will have more strength for the closet after sustenance.  Hee hee!"},
{"title": "Your Childhood Fear", "date": "Sunday, March 13, 2016", "text": "Sometimes I need a nudge to write as not every day is blog worthy.  I ran across a site -- The Daily Post (dailypost.wordpress.com) -- which gives some suggestions for blog posts.  All of the suggestions are nostalgia based.  I think I will give it a go.The topic I chose out of the five suggested is \"Your Childhood Fear\". I had a good childhood.  I was born in that time right after World War II when American was coming back from those dark days.  I grew up in post war tract housing just like almost everybody from my generation.  My house was a small (tiny by today's standards) white, asbestos shingle house with a blue roof and blue window shutters.  It was a plain little house but it was my little house. I remember that house so well and our lives that transpired within.  One of our rituals was bath time.  Our bathroom was typical of the time.  The walls were tiled with four by four inch ceramic tile -- ours was light blue with dark blue trim and the floors were light blue hexagon tile.  There was a tub, a sink, a potty, a medicine cabinet, a linen closet, dirty clothes hamper and a gas wall heater.  Those bathrooms were fairly large and very utilitarian.  I was glad mine matched the outside of the house -- I liked the blue theme going on.My mother saw to my bath and in the winter she would light the heater to get the room toasty warm -- all that tile could be chilly -- and before I emerged from the tub she would hold my pajamas up in front of the heater to warm them.  I just loved the feel of those warm pajamas.I must have been very small because I was still in diapers and plastic pants when the great fear began.  I brought it on myself trying to emulate my mother's routine.  One day, in the winter, the heater was on and I decided the thing to do was to \"warm\" my plastic diaper cover in front of the heater.  The cover had snaps down both sides so it opened up flat and I very deftly placed the cover on the heater draped from top to bottom and went about my business.My mother smelled something burning.  Could it have been melting plastic?  Why, yes it could.  She rushed into the bathroom and pulled the diaper cover from the heat and yelled at me (and rightfully so) that I could have burned the house down! She was frightened and I guess I was too except I don't really remember the incident, I just remember being told about it. What I do remember, however, is having a recurring nightmare for years about my house burning down.  In the dream my mom, dad and I -- and the cat -- would be standing at the curb looking back at the house which was going up in flames.  I was terrified.  One day in school we had to draw a family picture and this is the scene I drew.The dream finally stopped when I was 19.  Why, you ask?  Because our house caught fire one January night.  We aren't sure why -- my father suspected foul play but the fire department stated the cause was a gas leak at the hot water heater.  The next day I found myself standing at the curb looking back at the house that had burned down.  And I was no longer afraid."},
{"title": "Oh What A Week! -- Or Two!", "date": "Saturday, March 12, 2016", "text": "In my previous post I explained that I would be away for a while because I was going to help my daughter out.  That was a bit cryptic and I didn't mean it to be, I just don't like to post online personal things that could be identifying factors.The fact of the matter is my son-in-law was in Boston for a business trip.  My daughter doesn't mind staying alone but the mornings are a bit - uh - hectic to say the least.  She teaches school.  Bean goes to school.  They have to get ready and leave all at the same time.  It is pretty much a logistical nightmare without son-in-law so I spent the night to help with the mornings.  It worked well, they have a comfy bed for me and, since Bean retires reasonably early, I had ample reading time.  The only downside was the drive back and forth.  Lots of driving.  Tired.So, Thursday night of that week, son-in-law Chip returned home on a later flight.  I had already returned home and climbed in my bed with my book. The phone rang about 11 -- it was my daughter in a panic.  Chip had returned home SICK! REALLY SICK! I thought maybe there was an exaggeration going on but 104 temp in an adult is not an exaggeration.  He was medicated and put to bed with the plan to tote him to the doctor the next day.  The next day came and I picked Bean up from school and brought her home with me.  She hadn't really seen her father yet or been around him so I just removed her from the situation. Chip had a raging case of the flu.This was an impromptu decision so I really wasn't prepared.  There was grocery shopping to be done, art supplies to be replenished, beds to be made -- so much for \"resting up\".So, Bean spent the weekend through Monday with us.  Yes, she missed school on Monday but we just live too far away for us to get her up and to school on time.  She wasn't happy about that but nothing could be done.The weekend was chock full of activities.  Saturday involved a Girl Scout outing -- a movie with her troop.  We were able to go to the new movie theater in Keller -- we saw \"Zootopia\" -- and it was lovely.  The food was great, the theater was new and nice and the movie was -- meh -- a little too much adult humor for me but I guess they have to have something for all the adults in the audience.Sunday found us attending a birthday party at the Grapevine Aquarium --The aquarium was nice but honestly, it made me dizzy.  There were many acrylic floors over water with moving fish and it just sent me reeling.  It was lovely and I am sure it would be quite interesting if I weren't in charge of a youngster and it wasn't so crowded.  However, the kids loved it and there were all sorts of activities so a good time was had by all. Monday was the finale of our little impromptu \"break\" and it was spent doing laundry and gathering things strewn all over -- and did I mention there were scones?I did take some photos around the garden -- this season of anti-winter we have been having has resulted in an early spring and here are some photos to prove it.  Now if the rain would just quit I would be happy -- oh, and if we could abolish daylight savings time -- that would help.I also took some time to set up my little home gym.  And I do mean little! I don't have room for anything large so I have accommodated myself in a little corner of my bedroomTony Little Gazelle -- sorry the pic is sideways -- use your imaginationa pedaler a chair that provides upper body exercise coupled with the pedaler it makes a nice little recumbant bikeAb rocket -- yes, I have had this for a while -- it is good but getting on the floor is a challengeNow the goal for the coming week is to clean out my closet.  I would say 90% of what I have in there I haven't worn in at least 5 years and it is going -- away.  Soon.  I bought two new blouses and a new polo shirt which is good and I am going to order some new slacks.  Trying to streamline things -- however, it won't happen until I get started.I am reading a book titled \"Embers\" by Antoinette Stockenberg.  It is pretty good so far -- about 1/3 of the way through -- but I hope it doesn't turn stupid.   I have read supernatural books that started out really good and then just turned silly as the story progressed.  I hope this isn't that way. I will let you know.So, that is my two week hiatus.  Not very relaxing but definitely full of activities that were new to me.  My weekends are usually very quiet but last weekend was a nice change.  Maybe I will eventually recover.  But, oops, here comes DST weekend -- so much for that!"},

{"title": "This 'n That and Monkey and Dog", "date": "Sunday, February 21, 2016", "text": "This weekend -- beginning on Thursday -- has been busy and yet not busy.  It was a good mix of the two. Bean didn't have school on Friday so we were scheduled to babysit.  However, I had another plan.  I decided we would pick her up from school as usual, take her to her doctor's appointment and then bring her home for the night rather than us getting up at dawn and driving to her house.  She loves to come here because I make her chocolate chip pancakes.  my assistant reading me the recipe and that is Scout, her Daisy troop Bear that goes on adventures with the girls.enjoying the fruits of our labor and yes, that is the Christmas village you see in the background -- I can't talk about itYum on the griddleThen, after breakfast was consumed and the kitchen put in order we went to one of the most magical places I know of.  It is an independent bookstore called Monkey and Dog.  It is owned and operated by Shelley Lowe, a friend from church and it is housed in the corner of a catering business called Feastivities owned by Charissa Christopher, also a church friend.Monkey and Dog is just delightful -- it is a bookstore solely dedicated to children's  books and there is a huge variety of books to be explored --- some even from my childhood days.  We spent a large chunk of the morning there and Bean didn't want to leave -- I can't say I blame her -- I was enjoying the cozy lounge chair and all the books that I would have loved to have taken home with me.The cozy lounge chair with Gramps trying to stay out of the photo! Gotcha Gramps!Just look at that assortment of books!So charming!Fantastic find!More for the collection of Magic Tree House booksAnd for my personal library -- I have started reading it and it is just magicalSo, after we finally pried B away from the bookstore we headed to Zeeba's to get her bangs trimmed.  Thanks, sweet Falan for being so accommodating!B loves to sweep the floor because Falan has this really cool machine that you sweep the cut hair up to it and turn it on and it sucks the hair right in! B loves it and Falan doesn't mind letting her take care of that little business for her!Then it was home for a nap -- yes, there is a real bed for her to sleep in but nothing quite like improvisation, is there?  Who knows, next trip over she might just sleep here. And then a quick go at this game. It is fun but you really need to be in good light because the cards are so dark.  I have been looking for pick up sticks but there are none to be found so I will have to order them online.  Ugh.That was all we had time for since Mom and Dad were picking her up after dinner.  They were going on a short road trip yesterday and today so she had to get home to get ready.  After all that activity, I needed to rest a bit but it was such good fun!This morning I had a look around my house to see what needed tidying up and I realized that I hadn't been outdoors in a few days to see what this lovely spring-like weather is doing to the garden.  So, I decided to share a few snaps with you of the garden and some other things around here.I have no clue what this is -- a weed I think -- but it has lovely purple flowers on it.The Redbud tree coming out -- pretty pink blossoms -- more photos when they open upA lap quilt I made lest you think all I do is read and bloga really cute bottle I purchased for my homemade deodorant --yes I don't use commercial deodorantmy new obsession -- flavored water -- isn't it pretty?  Cucumbers, lemons, strawberries and mintHubs and his latest project -- a second tv antenna for the tv in the bedroomAnd this is something I am looking to buy --It is on sale and it folds up.  I have a Tony Little Gazelle but Hubs uses it and it just about kills my knee so I thought I would buy this and we could exercise together in front of the tv with the new antenna! Sounds like a plan, don't you think?Wow, it is Sunday again! The time is really flying by and, since we have opted out of winter this year, it seems like we are just racing toward summer! I can handle summer.  Just not mosquitoes.  But, the mosquitoes haven't gone away anyway so I am not going to let that to deter me from enjoying this really, really early spring.So, this last week I made an effort to try some new things, tweak some old things and see what worked and what didn't.  So, here is what I learned...After 43 years of marriage I have finally conquered the laundry.  My new approach has been working well -- washing each and every day and smaller loads.  I am finding that if I do smaller loads I can get them done and put away and it is much preferable to staring into the \"face\" of a pile of laundry  that consists of everything we own.  So, this approach is a keeper.I have not conquered emptying the dishwasher at night but I have managed to get it emptied in the morning and just fill it during the day.  I have also learned that a sink full of hot water at the ready makes it very easy to quickly wash things as you use them.  I know it sounds ridiculous to say these things -- a mature woman who has been keeping house for a LONG time but some things are not easily disciplined.  I had a perfectly good role model in my mother.  She never had a dishwasher but she wasn't one to let things sit around either -- those dishes were washed immediately after use and the light turned off in the kitchen -- there was no revolving door like in our house.  But, anyway, I have pretty much conquered the kitchen \"issue\".  Next I am going to try to cook without using every dish/pot/pan in the kitchen! That sounds like a challenge, doesn't it?I am loving my Bona floor system (no, not getting paid to say that) and I have also learned that I don't have to mop the entire house at once even though it is a large, flowing expanse of solid flooring.  I can do it in sections and that is fine.  So, that is a new \"tweak\" and it is working.These things have made my life easier.  I am the sort that can't play until the chores are done and that breeds lots of contempt for the chores when you can't get them done in a timely manner.  With my new approach, I feel like I am giving myself permission to read or sew or quilt or whatever and I am still getting stuff done.  It is amazing how quickly these chores really take when you just get up and do them.  Duh.I guess we are never too old to learn!"},

{"title": "Throwback Thursday", "date": "Thursday, February 18, 2016", "text": "Throwback Thursday -- 1977- I ThinkMy baby boy, circa 1977, with his very first ice cream cone -- EVER -- after seeing a Micky Mouse show at the local mall.I have been blogging for a long time but I don't think many people know I have a son.  I don't post about him and his family because they don't allow me to include photos.  That makes me sad, though, because he was such a beautiful child who has grown into a handsome man with a lovely family. He is the father of my three grandchildren -- Nathan, age 9, Kathryn, age 7 and Emily, age 15 months. I remember the day of this photo so well.  I had bought his outfit at Joske's and he absolutely hated it and I think this was the only time he ever wore it! He got so excited at this Micky Mouse show that he was literally hyperventillating! He had such a wonderful time and then......he got his first ice cream cone.  He loved it! And he didn't get it all over my mother's car!It was such an exciting day and I really like looking back at those \"old\" photos! I might have to start posting some of him \"back in the day\" -- I don't think they would have a problem with that.Anyway, this is my TBT for today!"},

{"title": "This N That", "date": "Tuesday, February 16, 2016", "text": "Well, I can already tell it is going to be one of those random, meandering days.  I woke up before 6 a.m with my knee killing me.  I went to bed with both feet and ankles swollen last night -- something that never happens to me and I was concerned but this morning they are better but the knee is giving me grief. I am used to that.  My left knee was diagnosed as useless with I was 34 -- the years haven't made it better, that is for sure.  I have even thought about getting a cane.As I realized, at 5:45 a.m. that I was not going back to sleep I laid there for a while and took stock of my upcoming day.  I needed to do something but I didn't have a plan. So what else is new -- I never have a plan.The laundry is going well doing it everyday.  You wouldn't think that just two people could generate enough laundry to wash everyday but you would be surprised.  Also, I am trying to get back to my youthful activity of getting the bedsheets washed every Monday.  When I was a new bride that was my routine -- sheets on Monday.  Well, somewhere in the last 43 years that got put to the bottom of the list of priorities but I am trying to bring it to the surface again.  Routines are good.  I am just not good at them.I said in a previous post that I was going to try the swiffer again and I did.  I was appalled at the dust I picked up and I had just vacuumed a couple of days ago! So, I guess I will be swiffering more often -- better than dragging Ruby out.Ruby can be a bit heavy and unwieldy so I try to only bring her out when I absolutely need her. I have also started -- AGAIN -- a food journal.  I have a Jawbone activity tracker which I am finding to be so inconvenient because I can't put my hands in water while wearing it.  I am not a neat housekeeper and I will get it wet and that is a no-no.  I have also tried calorie counting using MyFitnessPal.  I even bought a new ipad that would sync all of it together.  Epic Fail.I am not a novice at food journaling, calorie counting, being completely obsessed over food -- no, not a novice.  I have been doing this since I was about 17 years old and thought I was fat.  I wish I was as fat now as I was when I thought I was fat!  Anyway, I read an article last night about not counting calories, just journaling what you eat, when you eat, how you feel when you eat -- blah, blah, blah -- psychobabble, you know, just to make yourself aware of what you are doing just in case you are one of those people who go to look for the cookies and find them gone and realize that you are the one who ate them and you have no recollection of doing any such thing. Indeed. So, at 5:45 this morning as I lay in bed wishing I could go back to sleep I started thinking about the perfect journal to start this amazing journaling in. I decided I needed to jet to my neighborhood half price books and pick up the perfect journal.  Then I realized that I have a whole shelf full of partially used journals that all represent false starts so maybe the prudent thing to do is to pick out one of those and begin.  Beginning is always the hardest thing especially when you need supplies -- like journals and colored pens. So, this is the journal I chose -- off my shelf -- with some pages torn out.  It is by Foray and you can actually buy replacement journals to fit inside the cover. Mine is the brown one and it is small enough to carry in a purse if I so desire.  I doubt I will desire but who knows. In any event, I have no intention of weighing and measuring my food -- I have done that enough to be able to tell what a portion looks like.  Or do I?  So, that took my thoughts to scoops -- like ice cream scoops.  I need a scoop to measure out 1/2 cup of whatever.  That immediately sent me off on an internet search for a #8 (4 oz.) \"disher\" - available by mail order only.  Of course.  I will never get my charge paid off if I can't go to a store and actually buy something with, you know --  money -- and bring it home without having to pay shipping.All of this before 7 a.m.  Do you see what I mean about it being a random day?So, let's take stock -- I have folded the laundry from yesterday that took forever to dry and it is put away.  I have put the sheets in the washer and loaded the dishwasher with my toast plate.  I have gotten dressed, tossed my hair around (I wear a little bob that doesn't require much to fall into place -- I look like something out of the 1930's) and gathered some World War 2 memorabilia together for my daughter's history class on that era.But, that brings us to the dishwasher.  My goal was run the dishes after dinner and empty it before I retired for the night so the morning would find me with a clean sink and an empty dishwasher -- does anybody remember Flylady?  Shine your sink?  Get dressed to your shoes?  Ok, so no shoes.  Anyway, last night I was so confused because I had three dishes in the dishwasher.  They were dirty.  Should I wash them by hand and have a clean dishwasher this morning?  Should I run the dishwasher with three dishes in it? I think not.  What should I do? Was there a right answer?  I went to bed and left the three dishes in there to be combined with todays dishes.  Don't you just hate major life decisions?  Why can I make huge decisions concerning other things but just completely crumple when trying to figure out what to do with three stupid dishes?  Honestly, sometimes I don't understand me at all. So, since I am having a completely random day, I think I will go cook some rice for dinner and defrost some chicken to make some chicken strips tonight.  Maybe a salad would be nice.  I still have some pears to use up so I can toss those in there too. We have Bean this afternoon so I think I should give some thought to dinner early so when I come home complete knackered I won't have to think about it too much.  Plus, if I do it early I can clean up the mess early! Yay! Thinking outside the box! Novel for me.I will let you know how it goes later.  By the way, I cook my rice in the oven.  It works great."},
{"title": "Starting Over Sunday", "date": "Monday, February 15, 2016", "text": "Ok, so, I know it isn't Sunday and I needed to have written this yesterday but yesterday was Valentine's Day, which is lame excuse because we don't \"do\" Valentine's Day.  The better reason was I felt wretched all day -- allergies for sure and something was giving me indigestion  so I was a real woof-woof all day.  So, I am going to give it a go today.  Starting Over Sunday is a meme of my own creation to sort of re-start myself for the next week.  Never having been one to plan ahead much, this is a stretch for me but hopefully it will help me focus.  Want to join in?  Leave a link to your blog here in the comment section if you would like.So, here I go--1.  Continue with my new approach to housecleaning.  I absolutely hate to clean house and I am not good at it so I decided to take a lesson from one of my favorite books -- \"A Woman of Substance\" and follow Emma Hart's example of assigning a time to each task for it to be completed in.  I have been doing this, setting the kitchen timer and giving each task a 20 minute window of time.Seems that the chores that I find to be so daunting (vacuuming?) and time consuming can actually be done is a very small amount of time if one gets up off her bum and actually does it.  Very enlightening.2.  Meal Planning was a bust last week.  I had all the ingredients in the house for a number of meals but for some reason I couldn't find where I stashed my energy.  We ate out a lot.  Bad, bad Melissa. So, last night I started over.  We had a pork loin simply seasoned with salt and pepper and roasted in the oven.  I actually managed to not over cook the thing and it was really tender.  With it we had couscous, green beans and pear and cottage cheese salad.  I had also made some bread so we each had a slice of that.  Not sure what we will be having tonight -- must get on that soon so something will be defrosted.3.  Laundry is now under control.  Laundry seems to be my nemesis.  It is prolific.  It multiplies itself in the night.  So, even though I am trying very hard to be frugal and green, I have been washing at least one load a day.  It might be two -- this morning it is two --but they aren't large.  I have an HE machine and I remember the salesman telling us that it was ok to wash small loads as this machine uses less water to begin with so that is what I am going on. It is working well for me because I am actually able to get it washed, dried, folded and put away all in the same day.  Did I mention that I am lazy? I might add that I am using the dryer again but in a much better way than before.  I just got so tired of wet laundry hanging everywhere and it never feeling like it was done that I had to go back to the dryer but I am very careful not to over dry and I am taking clothes out immediately and putting them away properly so nothing is over drying or sitting in the dryer until I remember that I put it in -- sometimes that could take days.  So, as of now I am up to date on the laundry and am actually working on my two loads for today as we speak.4.  Dishwashing has become a non-issue because I have now trained myself to wash the dishes immediately upon use. Hmmmm.... I wonder if Hubs was done with his dinner last night when I took his plate?  Well, he shouldn't have left the table if he wasn't done.  I love my dishwasher but it is noisy and I really don't like unloading it.  So, I have figured out that to wash the dishes for the two of us isn't exactly time consuming so I have been doing them immediately instead of letting them sit there until I empty the dishwasher.  Maybe soon I will have disciplined myself to empty the dishwasher before bed so I can just load the dishwasher throughout the day and run it after dinner.  I am working on that but for now, I wash 'em as I see 'em.A couple of weeks ago I bought a Bona floor system to help with the floors -- I have a lot of solid flooring in this house -- only two rooms with carpet and those are soon to be history.  I really like this because it makes mopping really easy.  I don't do well with heavy equipment anymore so this is just perfect.  The dust mop is good but nothing much seems to stick to it.  So, today, I am going to go back to Swiffer for a bit even though it goes against my sensibilities because of all of its disposability.  I already have it so there isn't a purchase to be made.  I do use the furniture duster anyway so what is the difference?Sleeping Beauty (aka the Hubs) and I are on two completely different schedules.  I get up early and go to bed early.  He sleeps very late in the morning (at least I think it is late) and he goes to bed later.  So, I am ready to get on things in the morning because by lunch I am more or less done.  I need to be able to get my stuff done and still be quiet lest I wake the sleeping monster.  So, dust mopping the floors, washing the dishes by hand, getting the laundry going all make it much easier for me to get on with my business while he is ......sleeping.  Shhhh!A couple of goals this week are to train myself to empty the dishwasher before bed, do a bit of organization in the closet and get back to some sewing.  All of this rethinking the housework was in an effort to get me back to sewing and doing needlework.  I went to school with a girl whose mother would get up at 4 a.m and do all the housework -- top to bottom -- and the laundry each and every day.  She even wore a uniform.  Then, she would make breakfast and get the children off to school.  When they were gone she would retreat to her bedroom to shower and do her beauty routine (not to be disturbed during this process).  She would emerge, dressed to the nines, ready to go about her business of shopping.  Every. Single. Day.  It must have worked for her because she only recently passed away at the ripe old age of 90+.  So, there you go.Well, the dryer is buzzing so I must go.  Have a wonderful day!"},

{"title": "Maybe It Is Just My Age", "date": "Saturday, February 13, 2016", "text": "I think I am getting old.  I don't mean chronologically old -- that is a given and I am thankful for the opportunity considering the alternative.  I mean emotionally old.  I have always felt young -ish -- settling somewhere on 19 years old.  I didn't look past too much and didn't look forward too much, I just sort of basked in the glory of 19 and that is my paradigm.Fast forward a few decades and my interest in genealogy was sparked.  It was always there, somehow smoldering in the recesses of my mind but then it ignited and became a burning desire to know from whence I came.I went through the motions as outlined in the genealogy how-to manuals.  Start with yourself and work backward.  Write down all you know.  What you don't know, find out and, if at all possible, obtain documentation.I remember the first piece of real documentation I received.  My great-grandmother's death certificate.  Yes, it was a death certificate, the woman was dead, in 1937, 13 years prior to my birth -- most decidedly dead but that piece of paper brought her to life for me.  I was thrilled.  My mother thought it odd.  She held that piece of paper as if somebody had just dug it out of Great-grandmother Davis's coffin. It came from the Scranton Health Department, not some dark corner somewhere.This process occurred time and time again and each time I marvelled that the person in question, that I most likely had never known, had a back history other than just a name I had heard.  Several times I learned that what we KNEW absolutely without a doubt about a person was WRONG.  Yep, wrong.So, anyway, I digress.  The thing is this is all just factual stuff.  It never gives you an insight into what the person was like, their hopes, fears, likes, dislikes, etc.  But what it does give you is a timeline.  That, coupled with some photos if you are very, very lucky, will give you references to time.Time is what I have been thinking about lately.  I have been going through some old photos -- well, actually, trying to tidy up the photos that fell out of the photo box and needed picking up.  Suddenly I was so aware of the photo subjects ages.There is one that particularly strikes me -- my 2nd birthday party.  I am with my grandmother.  She appears to be an old lady.  The reality is she is 50 -- 15 years younger than I am right now.  I don't feel like I look as old now as she did then.  Then I look at my wedding photos in 1972 -- she doesn't look any different than she did at 50!  Well, maybe a little different but not much.I am watching my daughter be a girl scout leader and thinking about my own mother.  I was seven when my mother had our troop -- she was 34 at the time.  My daughter is now 36 and doesn't look any different than she did in high school.  Was my mother ever 34?  Why didn't my mother seem young?  Did my mother look like she did in high school?  I have photos and I have to say no.  I think about my teachers in school who all seemed like ancient crones to me.  Since I have access to Ancestry.com it is very easy to research some of these teachers.  Oh my goodness -- they weren't ancient -- some of them weren't even 40! And, the odd thing is, my mother and I attended the same junior high school and had some of the same teachers -- Mrs. Chappell comes to mind.  My mother talked about them being old and then I had them twenty years later and they still weren't old so how old were they when my mother was in their classes.I find age to be fascinating and disturbing all at the same time.  What makes somebody old?  Not old?  Attitude?  Good face cream?  Good genes?  It is amazing to me when I look at family history and see that those \"ancestors\" who seem so far flung weren't all that long ago.Another thing that is amazing to me is familial appearance.  I have met a cousin from England named Sharon.  She is a true cousin -- my great-grandmother and her great-great-grandfather were brother and sister. She still lives in England although she has lived in Texas as well (small world).  When she looked at my photo she told me that I looked just like her mother at the same age.  How could I look like somebody I had never known?  Then, once while visiting Fredericksburg, Texas, I was in a gift shop looking at a historical book of the families in the area and a sales person asked about my interest and I told her -- I turned around full face to her and she went white and told me I looked just like some lady who had just been in the store.  She knew the woman and knew that she was kin to my family and I LOOKED JUST LIKE HER!  I never saw the woman so I don't know but the lady in the shop looked like she had seen a ghost.Then, as I walked out of the shop I struck up a conversation with a lady who was a local and I told her I was interested in researching the name \"Banta\" because my grandmother was a Banta.  She looked at me and asked about my line and I told her I didn't know, I hadn't gotten that far.  She gave me her card and said to contact her because she was a Banta and we were surely cousins.  Now, years later, I am sure we are but I lost her card.My Banta lineage has always been a mystery because of a series of unfortunate events.  I cannot prove, through documentation, that I am a part of it but the Ancestry.com DNA test connects me to the Banta line without doubt.  Will that work for membership in the Mayflower Society for which there is a connection?  Not yet but at some point they are going to have to accept DNA testing as conclusive evidence.  It doesn't work for DAR either and I can't become part of a Native American tribe either but it answers my questions.  Seems my undocumentable family line is the most interesting of all because it takes me to Native American lineage, Mayflower lineage, even British Royal lineage.  All unproveable but there nonetheless.So, what is the purpose of this little rant?  None except that I have been having this surreal look at time and place and realize it means very little.  What seems so long ago really isn't, what seems far away isn't, what seems old really isn't, what seems like it ends doesn't but actually comes full circle. My friend Mary, in England, wrote on her blog that America seemed like a land as far away as the moon to her five year old self.  I would have to agree that England was just someplace far, far away that I knew my family came from long, long ago -- a place only to be imagined and never to be seen.  Now, sixty years later England isn't very far away, it wasn't that long ago that my family came from Wales to the US, those \"old\" people who got on that boat and sailed to America back at the turn of the century were just young people looking for opportunity.  Somehow those numbers just don't have any meaning anymore. Did they ever?  Maybe we just viewed things differently.A lot to ponder.  I feel like I have somehow been channelling my father because he used to think about things like this.  Now I think my brain is tired so I am off to help sell Girl Scout cookies."},

{"title": "Throw Back Thursday", "date": "Thursday, February 11, 2016", "text": "This is a photo of Zipp's Pharmacy located in the \"new\" shopping center of Allena Village in San Antonio in the 1950's.  This shopping center, built in around 1953 was in the \"suburbs\" but still not far from our house so we started shopping there.The shopping center was also home to HEB grocery store, Kelly's Barber and Beauty shop, The Juvenile -- a children's clothing store, a ladies clothing store, a shoe store and, of course, Winn's -- the best 5 and 10 cent store ever.Saturday was our shopping day for the most part and we would hit this shopping center early.  My mom would get her hair done, we would shop the clothing stores and Winn's, have lunch at the lunch counter at this very drug store and then grocery shop before going home.We used this pharmacy until it closed -- I remember getting my pre-natal vitamins there because we lived in the neighborhood attached to this shopping center.  I also remember buying many bottles of Presco Nose Drops which I used to combat the perpetual stuffiness from perpetual allergies!I remember the mobile library coming to this shopping center and my husband remembers a truck that would park in the parking lot and you could have your feather pillows cleaned, fluffed and restuffed.  I don't remember that.The HEB Grocery Store was not a huge store but it was a great store -- it had a bakery, it sold records (remember records?), cosmetics and perfume -- it was one stop shopping and, sometimes, you could even get a date! That is where I met my husband way back in 1965.  Saturdays were so cool then!So, anyway, I have fond memories of this drug store and this shopping center and this entire side of San Antonio.  It was a really nice place to grow up.Yesterday I finished reading \"Agatha Raisin and the Fairies of Fryfam\" by M C Beaton.  I have to say that one of my favorite things is a series of books to read -- I like the continuity and the Agatha Raisin books don't disappoint -- may I say the omnipresent James Lacey?  I have to say, though, that I have been disappointed in a couple of the \"episodes\" if you will but not this one.  I thoroughly enjoyed the \"fairies\".This episode takes Agatha to Norfolk to run away -- again -- from James.  It seems she is always running away from or toward James and I am not sure why except he seems to be a challenge for her in one way or another. Personally, I don't see it -- but to each his own.In any event, she winds up in the village of Fryfam and smack in the middle of another mystery -- and she has fairies in the back garden of her rental.  Or does she?  She may never really know.This book follows much the formula of all the others -- Conflict (usually James) causes Agatha to depart her cottage in Carsley.  She finds herself in the middle of some local drama -- murder seems to be a common thing in small English villages -- and she, of course, out does the local police in finding the killer and solving the mystery but not without coming quite close to finding herself pushing up daisies as well.  There is always a sub-drama as well -- in this case -- the fairies.At the end of these books she is always suffering from some amount of regret, shame, or embarrassment and this book was no different.  She always has a moment that she chastises herself for her flight from home and swears to never leave again but, of course, she does.These books are very formulaic but still quite enjoyable.  They are \"cozy\" and easy to read and nice to curl up with by the fire for a long evening of reading. However, this title ended a bit differently -- a cliff hanger in a way and....what about those fairies?I would recommend this series to anybody who is just reading for pure pleasure."},

{"title": "Birds In the House and Superstition", "date": "Tuesday, February 09, 2016", "text": "My mother always told me that birds in the house were bad luck.  I believe this idea came from my grandmother who tended to hold dear to some specific superstitions -- probably coming from her Native American ancestry.  One day my grandmother walked into her living room and found a little owl that had fallen down the chimney and she told my grandfather to phone his family because she was sure his mother had passed away and she was right.  Of course, the death was expected but never mind that! Then, the day my grandfather passed away I was up before anybody else, I made a cup of tea and some toast and I kept hearing a noise that got progressively louder.  I investigated and found a sparrow flying repeatedly into the dining room window glass.  It was frantic.  I am sure he was seeing his reflection but, as luck would have it, my grandfather passed away a few hours later.Do I believe in this superstition?No.I love birds.  I love birds in cages, in the yard and the decorative variety as well.  I didn't realize how many birds I have around my house but today I took notice and took photos.  So, welcome to my aviary!I just love this funky blue bird -- came from Pier 1 several years agoThis beautiful duck was parting gift to my husband when he ended a long term project in MontrealHad to add this -- Hubs painted me a picture of a little red tree that was outside his dorm window at Texas A&M University back in around 1970My crazy fat chickens I received these ducks as a Mother's Day gift from my children when they were little.  The blue bows were added by my motherLittle bird in a birdcage craft project I made a long time agoThe swan on top of my computer desk.  Way over my head -- I had to sort of guess where to point the camera.  This bird belonged to my mother.My mother in law had a chicken collection.  My daughter asked for a couple and these were left homeless so I took them.  They are a little retro.The newest addition -- two tiny birds I found at Apple Annie's a couple of weeks ago.I seriously don't like a bunch of stuff sitting around so most of the things I have usually have some sentimental value to me (the birds from Apple Annies were an impulse moment).  I was looking around my house today preparing to dust and I couldn't understand why it appeared so cluttered and now I know why.There are birds everywhere!"},

{"title": "Starting Over Sunday", "date": "Sunday, February 07, 2016", "text": "I've developed my own meme -- Starting Over Sunday.  My goal in the new year was to blog each and every day and wean myself from social media.  I had been doing pretty good until this week when everything sort of unraveled.The last time I was here was Tuesday.  Then my hours started filling up with -- what?  House cleaning and laundry.  My goal with laundry is to wash a load each day so it never piles up again.  Now I have been charged with the duty of doing my mother in laws laundry so I really have to be vigilant.  Then, I decided to clean house.  I did a good deal of that on Wednesday and Thursday.  Of course, you can't see that today but I did do it.  Friday took us away from home all day.Friday was Grandparents day at my two older grandchildren's school and we were invited to attend.  We first went to Kathryn's classroom, then to Mass, then back to Kathryn's classroom where we listened to reports on their favorite animal and got to see dioramas they built depicting their favorite animal in its natural habitat.  Kathryn's favorite animal was a snow leopard and she did a beautiful job on her diorama.  I wish I had taken a photo of it but we didn't have many opportunities for photos -- this is a fast moving event.After Kathryn's presentation we went to Nathan's classroom to watch their presentations about their favorite president.  The students were put in groups of three or four and each group acted out a skit and shared a timeline they had done as a poster to detail each president's life.  Nathan's group focused on Theodore Roosevelt.  They did a wonderful job as did all the other groups.  They were a delight to watch as there was drama and humor and giggles and there was even a stand in for one little girl who decided to leave. There was a lovely reception with sweet rolls and coffee and it was there that I got to meet one of Kathryn's friends and her grandparents.  Such nice people, it was a good time.I wish I had photos but I have been asked to not put photos of the children on the internet.  I respect that but it would certainly liven up the post. Then, later Friday evening, we went back to my son's house for Nathan's 9th birthday party with the family.  There was a meal and gift opening and lots of cuddling with Emily, the 16th month old granddaughter.  About 9:45 it was time to leave -- I was turning into a pumpkin.I got up at 5:15 on Friday morning and didn't go to bed until 11:30 Friday night.  There were four trips back and forth to my son's house, each being about 45 minutes long.  I don't think I need to explain why yesterday I was completely exhausted and actually pretty mad at the world.  I don't do well when I get too tired and I had surpassed THAT at about 5 p.m. Friday afternoon.Yesterday morning I sewed Girl Scout patches on Bean's vest -- it is really filling up and looking spiffy.   Yesterday afternoon I grocery shopped.  I was out of everything.  Well, not exactly true -- out of meat but if I don't have meat I am basically out of everything.  So, I went -- even though I was bushed -- and I shopped.  I spent $238 dollars but, by golly, I have meat now.  And canned tomatoes which I had run out of.  So, anyway, too much money spent but the pantry and the freezer look healthier now and I can relax that I can put meals together for several days now.  And.....we ate out last night. Last night I watched the debate and took my sassy self to bed where I fell out before I ever hit the bed.  So far I am feeling a bit better today but my allergies are raging, my ears are hurting and I feel like I have cotton stuffed behind my nose.So, off to church I go, home to cook lunch and then Hubs will watch the SuperBowl and I will write a long overdue letter to my pen pal.  And tomorrow I will try hard to get back on a blogging routine.Have a wonderful day!"},

{"title": "Soji", "date": "Saturday, January 30, 2016", "text": "Soji – A brief period of mindful work; temple cleaningI am not a Buddist.  However, I am housework challenged.  There was an article on Facebook yesterday discussing the practice of Soji -- a brief period of mindful work.  Apparently after morning prayers, Buddists have Soji -- a period of approximately 20 minutes which is spent in mindful work.  Quietly.  No talking.  Each day each monk is assigned a task to be worked on for that period of time without the anticipation of completion, the goal is just doing the task rather than completing the task.The article was giving tips on how to apply this practice to housework.  No, you don't have to become a Buddist.  However, what the article proposed is that you take a task that is distasteful to you or problematic for you and spend 20 minutes tackling it and then, at the end of the 20 minutes you walk away.  It never said when you should walk back to finish said task.I have to be honest, my kitchen is an issue with me.  It is never truly clean like I would like it.  Why?  Am I lazy?  Well, yes, but that isn't the main issue.  In part it is because there is activity in my kitchen All. The. Time.  Hubs is retired.  Hubs likes to make coffee every couple of hours.  Hubs grinds his own beans.  Hubs is oblivious to the fact that coffee grounds go everywhere.  Hubs likes snacks.  Hubs could change his mailing address to that of our pantry.  I cook.  I use a crock pot which means, in mid morning, I might be prepping something for the slow cooker and two hours later I might be making bread.  Our kitchen is an active place and we have an open floor plan so it is, well, open in the middle of everything.  If I stopped to clean up all the time I would never get out of the kitchen.  Hence, the problem.So, this morning I decided to try the 20 minute thing.  Amazingly I got the dishwasher emptied and reloaded.  I got most of the pots and pans washed, dried and put away and the dish drainer emptied.  Another article I read a day or two ago suggested that you start your morning with an empty dishwasher, an empty sink filled with warm water and an empty dish drainer.  When prepping a meal wash and clean as you go.  Makes perfect sense.  I know, if I would spend as much time cleaning the kitchen as I do reading about cleaning the kitchen I would never have a messy kitchen.  That logic is not lost on me.  I need to mend my evil ways.  Maybe 20 minutes at a time.And, some thoughts on Marie Kondo's method of tidying up.  I am not sure my jeans are happy folded in their drawer.  Yesterday I was looking for a pair of slacks and couldn't find them anywhere so I looked in the jean drawer and there they were.  They had slipped from their folded slot under the jeans and in the process of digging them out all the jeans came unfolded and flew out of the drawer.  Now the whole drawer needs to be tidied.  I am thinking my jeans would be happier on hangers.  Oh, and did you know that Samsung washers can blow up?  If they do Samsung will reimburse your money and pay for any repairs to your damaged house.  Good to know.Have a happy Saturday -- I need to go tidy the jeans."},
{"title": "Home to Harmony by Philip Gulley", "date": "Thursday, January 28, 2016", "text": "When I finish a book I usually pick another right up -- I always need something to read, it seems.  I just finished \"Come Rain or Come Shine\" by Jan Karon and I was shopping my own bookshelves for something to read.  Trust me, I could have a mini - branch of B&N I have so many unread books.As I was looking through my own books I began to bag up some that I had either read and just didn't want anymore or that I just knew I would never read.  I picked up \"Home to Harmony\" by Philip Gulley and stood there weighing the decision -- sell or keep and read.  It is a very short book -- 237 pages -- so I thought I would give it a go.  One review said \"In a League with Jan Karon's Mitford series...Gulley's work is comparable to Gail Godwin's fiction, Garrison Keillor's storytelling and Christopher Guest's filmmaking.I have to agree with the review -- to me it was a mix of Karon's Mitford series with a little more humor and Garrison Keillor's stories.  However, with that said, I went into it more or less comparing it to those two authors which wasn't fair.  Early on I decided I wasn't enjoying it.  But I read on.  An on.  And, before you know it, I liked it.What is not to like about a small Quaker community in a small North Carolina town?  It was hysterical.  I can't pick out one part, it was all just funny with great characters.  I have to say that some of Pastor Sam Gardner's musings were the same as some of my musings at times.  It was a very comfy book to read. And, as usual, I hated to see it end.So, I did a little research on the book and what do you know -- it is a series! Right up my alley.  I will probably read more of them -- I think there are five.  However, I will probably be reading them as e-books as I am really trying to get the library under control -- really.I would recommend this book.Social media has a little activity called Throwback Thursday where people post old photos.  I decided to bring this to my blog today.  So, here you go.Meet my great-great grandmother, Dorietta Bierschwale Giles.  She was born 24 February 1849 in Hanover, Germany.  She married my great-great grandfather John Isom Giles 23 February 1869 in Kendall County, Texas.  Together they had 11 children.  She passed away 6 June 1919 in San Antonio, Texas at age 70 and is buried in the family cemetery in Harper, Texas."},
{"title": "Some of My Favorite Places", "date": "Tuesday, January 26, 2016", "text": "My plan to \"tidy\" and \"declutter\" has sort of gone awry. Sort of like this--It all sort of goes along with my natural tendency to \"clean when I see it\".  Well, yesterday I saw this --What a disaster So  set about doing a major tidying up -- such a mild, civilized way to put it.This is where I store my laundry and cleaner making supplies as well as my emergency lightingThe battery drawer -- relocated to a more logical place than a drawer in the living room where they had beenAnd this is what it looks like this morning -- now, I can't get rid of all the trappings of a laundry room but it is a major improvement, don't you think? Now possibly the laundry room can be one of my favorite places to go -- maybe.Some of my other favorite places to go are hardware stores.  We are regulars at Lowes, Home Depot, Westlake Ace and Jabo Ace.  They all have something different to offer and a lady can have a jolly good time shopping at these places as well as the husbands.  When I go to a hardware store I am either shopping for kitchen-y things or yard things or I am walking laps around the perimeter of the store to up my step count for the day.  My knees and feet hurt too much if I have to stand still too long waiting for Hubs to look at every little bit of whatever it is he looks at so I walk.At our last trip to Lowe's I decided to try this --I have a Reveal mop that works sort of like this but it has an attached reservoir that allows you to use any cleaner you want in it.  I really like it but it tends to be heavy and my shoulders seem to hurt these days so I thought this would be a good alternative.  The dust mop is good but the mop is so easy and the spray doesn't leave your floors sticky like the Swiffer stuff does.  I am finding this to be so easy, it is non-toxic and probably more expensive that I would like but my shoulder is worth it.  Now if my elbow would quit hurting I would be just dandy.At our last visit to Westlake Ace I was looking for this --I had run out and haven't been able to find it at any of the usual places but I found it at Westlake Ace.  As I was browsing the home keeping area I found these -- I scooped them up as they are quite sturdy and my silicone mixing spoons are turning a very strange color and I am growing suspicious of their safety. So, I brought these home.New wooden spoonsAnd then there was this little diversion to my day.  Awhile back I had purchased a little needlepoint kit for Bean similar to this--She seems quite interested in needlework and Sunday when she was here she asked if I would teach her to cross stitch.  Hmmmm......well, I told her I couldn't because I needed to get some special fabric for her.  It was the truth, I don't have any 14 ct. aida in my stash and I think anything smaller would be too hard for her.  I have heard of youngsters learning things like this to use large, even weave dish clothes and burlap and things of that nature to learn but I decided to just do this -- I had two good coupons at Joann's so I took a break from the laundry room to run across the street and pick up these things --I thought this would make a perfectly adequate sewing boxAnd sewing stuffShe has some aida and floss, a little pair of scissors, REAL needles with REAL rules, a child's apron with an iron on to learn to embroidery, some muslin and buttons to learn how to sew on a button.  I think that should keep me busy for a while, don't you?So, yesterday was a busy day and today I am looking forward to going to the used bookstore around the corner to sell some books and pick up the next Elm Creek Quilts title in my queue.  I love buying books used -- they are almost like new for the most part -- especially the hardbacks -- and it just feels like such a deal. Oh, yes, my lesson learned for this week -- don't ever buy whole chickens again no matter how great a price they are going for.  I took a whole chicken out of the freezer on Saturday morning to cook on Sunday.  Sunday it was frozen solid so I had to go to the store to buy more chicken.  Yesterday I checked, still frozen so I just left it in the fridge.  This morning, determined to cook that chicken I took it out of the fridge, unwrapped it and by golly, that thing is still frozen! However, I didn't care -- I sliced up an onion and put it on the bottom of the crock pot and that little chicken is now sitting proud on her onion throne and I may have to cook her until tomorrow but for certain we are going to eat this chicken and I will never buy a whole one again!"},

My daughter and son in law came by to drop off GS cookies so we visited for a while and had some coffee and, what else, GS cookies! I got my second wind.  I have now cleaned up a lot of the kitchen, folded laundry and am settling back to watch tonight's episode of \"Downton Abbey\". I hope I did enough to atone for missing Mass because I am surely tired now."},

I bought enough ingredients at my last grocery shopping to allow me some flexibility.  The meals have been simple and I have somehow been able to get past making enough food for a small army and just have dinner for two.The crockpot is slowly becoming my friend.  One of my favorite things to make in it is taco meat.  I have decided that I need to adjust my seasonings though because cooking it as long as I do, the spices become a little more intense than I think we need especially if we intend to use salsa. Speaking of salsa, we recently found this at our neighborhood Sprouts and definitely recommend it. Last night we had spaghetti with caeser salad and garlic bread.  I had enough spaghetti and sauce left to make two small portions for lunch today.  I surprised myself when I actually thought ahead to do that. Thinking ahead is not my strong suit, especially where food is concerned.  Tonight was supposed to be pizza night and it was but not without drama.  Hubs is the one who is the pizzameister.  He is quite good at it but he is quite busy today with a Sunday School project.  So, I decided to take on the task.  Since Hubs couldn't tell me what his dough recipe is I looked up one on Pinterest.  It went together well although I thought it was awfully sticky.  However, this is what it looked like for the second rise. I chopped up our favorite vegetables for pizza -- basil, black olives and mushrooms -- and there was pepperoni, too. I opened the Pomi tomatoes only to discover that I bought the wrong thing -- I needed peeled tomatoes, not strained tomatoes.  Oh well, I will just have to improvise, I thought. And I did. Then I pulled out the peel, sprinkled the cornmeal on it  and set about patting out the dough.  I decorated it with the vegetables and cheese and it looked like a work of art! And then, it happened.  Yes, the drama.The pizza stone had been heating and was just waiting for the sizzle of that dough and .....I couldn't get it off the peel.  I tried three times and each time a little bit of it fell into the oven.  I finally tried to put it on a pan and the whole thing just collapsed.  Hubs walked in asking \"how is it going\" just in time to see me throw the whole mess in the trash.It was a good thing there was a second one.  This time I put it on a pan -- I didn't have any more fresh basil so I had to use dry.  I put it in the oven and this was the final result.    It tasted ok, it was better than frozen but the second one wasn't nearly as gorgeous as the first one.  I was pretty miffed and said I just didn't understand why I couldn't get it off the peel and it was then that Hubs said I couldn't pat it out on the peel - I had to roll it out on a floured cutting board and then transfer it to the cornmeal covered peel and then it would slide off.  Well, who knew.For a moment I was quite deflated but it tasted it ok, the dough was ok -- not thick (I don't like thick) and not so thin as to be crispy.  So, after some thought I decided that we would have pizza again next Saturday night and I would try again.  I will not be done in by pizza dough!However, Hubs doesn't have to worry about losing his title of Pizzameister any time soon!"},
{"title": "The Meal Planning Experiment ", "date": "Friday, January 22, 2016", "text": "I spoke in an earlier post about trying to feed the Hubs and I like my mother fed us when I was a child.  I decided this week that I would employ her method of shopping so on Wednesday, Hubs and I visited our neighborhood SproutsThis is a photo of our actual neighborhood Sproutsto see what I could do.  So, I had some things in my head -- should have been on paper -- but I managed to pull together about a weeks worth of meals.  I even managed to check my freezers to see what I had on hand -- enough meat for about four meals and a few frozen veggies.  So, starting with that I purchased a nice roast, some chicken thighs for soup, some pepperoni for pizza that will be having tomorrow night, some bacon to put in the zucchini I bought to make calabacita.  Tonight we will be having spaghetti to use up the left over spaghetti sauce that I had from Monday's pesto chicken. When I decided to try my mother's approach to shopping it seemed easier to me.  Meal planning is not my forte! Of course, the bill rose a good deal because I had Hubs with me and he had to have his snacks and cheese.  He doesn't like Kerrygold cheese though because he says it tastes like grass.  Imagine that.  Anyway, he chunked a few things in the basket but I can't begrudge him as I chunked in a new Mineral Fusion lipstick so it all evened out.Of course, the day of the shopping ended with us going out to dinner! Muaaahhhhh (she laugh maniacally).  But, we were in the vicinity of his favorite hamburger place -- Chaps -- so I decided to indulge him and stop there for dinner with the idea that we would eat the tacos the next day that I had been cooking the meat for all day in the crock pot.  So, last night we did just that and I heated my tortillas a new way (well, for tacos, anyway) and it all turned out just fine. So, tonight it is spaghetti, tomorrow night homemade pizza and Sunday it will either the roast or a chicken I have squirreled away.  I have sides to go with all the meals and I think I did a pretty good job! Maybe doing it this way will make me dread grocery shopping less.  I can only hope."},
{"title": "Come Rain or Come Shine", "date": "Thursday, January 21, 2016", "text": "I just finished reading the new Mitford novel by Jan Karon, \"Come Rain or Come Shine\".  This book is the latest in a long series of books about Father Tim Kavanagh, an Episcopal priest in North Carolina.  This series has followed Father Tim through many life experiences and chronicles life in a small NC town.  I discovered the books in the mid-1990's at Book Stop (remember Book Stop?) and asked for the boxed set of the first three for Christmas.  I was completely taken in from the beginning and have read, and own, each and every book.The latest book, \"Come Rain or Come Shine\" chronicles the wedding of Dooley Kavanagh and Lace Harper.  Dooley and Lace were both \"lost\" children until they found love and nurture with two of the towns families.  Coming from such dire backgrounds and being old enough to know what was happening with them, they grew to adulthood with strong ideas of how they wanted their lives to be and they set out to make them that way -- together.In this latest work, Karon takes the whole crew to Meadowgate Farm for the wedding of the year! There are kids, cows, chickens, the Flower Sisters, Choo-Choo, Harley's teeth, strong winds and the threat of rain.  There is music by the Ham Biscuits and dancing on the porch -- a pot luck reception in the barn.  It actually sounded, to me, like the perfect venue!There were nerves, tears, fears, apologies -- accepted and not accepted -- and bride hysteria over the dress.And there was Jack Tyler.Enough said -- read the book and draw your own conclusions but I found it to be completely charming.  I will add that it is helpful if you read the series from the beginning because as this series progresses there are many references to prior books that you almost have to know in order to put the pieces together.  So, if you haven't read them, start at the beginning. These aren't long reads but so satisfying."},
{"title": "Keeping House Like Mama Did", "date": "Wednesday, January 20, 2016", "text": "Bette -- 1923Bette and Pat -- 1940'sMeet my mama.  She was born in San Antonio,  Texas in 1923 to Madge and Jim Davis and lived there all her life until 1990 when she and my dad relocated to Ft. Worth with us.  My mama was a driving force in my life.  I was an only child so I had her undivided attention -- sometimes not such a good thing! However, I pretty much adored her and decided early on the best way to do things was her way -- she seemed to accomplish so much with what seemed like so little effort.We lived in a small house so the caretaking wasn't as laborious as it is today in McMansions.  Also, my dad worked from 3 p.m. until midnight and she couldn't sleep if he wasn't home so she spent her days with me and then after I was asleep she would do the housework.  Our house was always squeaky clean and smelled of bleach and Lysol.  I know now that probably wasn't great with the chemicals and all but it always felt so clean.  She didn't have a particular routine that I know of -- she just cleaned up all the time! I remember her cleaning up before we went to bed -- I asked her why -- she said that way she didn't have to get up to a messy house.  Made sense.  Wish I could do it. Our house was always really clean, my mother wasn't frantic and overworked and I don't know how she did it -- must have been magic.I was thinking about this yesterday as I was cleaning house.  When we were first married and I was working I had a routine.  We also had a small house and it was so easy to get things done.  Somehow, along the way, the routines have been lost and I am now more of a \"I clean it when I see it\" sort of gal.  I don't like that -- maybe I should try to re-establish those routines of early marriage.  My house is much bigger now -- it is harder to clean -- too much floor to mop -- too tiring.  I think the folks on the minimalist/smaller house (not TINY house, oh no) have it correct.  I even read an article in the San Antonio newspaper that the neighborhoods that were made up of mid-century houses are booming again after a period of decline.  People are flocking to them and refurbishing them because they like the lower ceilings and the closed floor plans.  I can understand that.  I think those mid-century houses were easier to keep.  I digress.I think that my mother had the right idea about cleaning.  It isn't something you can ever finish -- it is an ongoing process and I think  where I personally get bogged down is thinking that I am going to clean house all in a day (not going to happen) and then it will be done.  It won't be done.  It will never all be done -- at least for very long -- and so I think an attitude adjustment is in order.  I read this on Rhonda's blog \"Down to Earth\" and she is right -- quit trying to \"finish the housework\" -- there is no such thing.Today is grocery shopping day for me.  Again, a departure from my youthful routine when I would grocery shop on the same day of the week.  I was much better at it when I was young -- now I just sort of go when there isn't anything in the house to eat.  That is not good.So, I decided to take a step back in time and look at how my mother did it.  As I mentioned in an earlier post, my mother grocery shopped every two weeks and she didn't really plan meals -- as in sitting down and writing out menus.  What she did was go to the meat counter and buy enough meat for two weeks.  She hit the produce for whatever produce she was going to buy for the two weeks that would stay fresh.  She did the same with the canned goods, frozen things and starchy items like rice and noodles and such.  She made sure she had enough for two weeks -- like two cans of green beans and maybe a big bag of fresh carrots.  I have decided that is how I am going to approach the grocery shopping this week.  To me that is easier than sitting down and trying to plan meals because when I try to do that all I can think of is tacos and then I go brain dead.  So, I think if I have the ingredients in the house for a decent number of meals then I can move forward and not be so intimidated by dinner!I have been doing a sugar detox -- fancy talk for \"dumping the sugar cold turkey\".  It is going well.  I am tackling any \"added\" sugar, like cookies and ice cream and stuff like that head on and then I am trying to cook more from scratch so I know what is in the food.  I have had a couple of interesting meals that Hubs actually ate.  Now, he didn't say he liked them but he ate them.Night before last I had pesto chicken with spaghetti squash and a wedge salad.  I don't like blue cheese but Hubs does so if I take some lettuce and dump some blue cheese dressing and some crumbles on it he is happy.  It turned out ok except my chicken was tough.  I hate tough chicken.Last night I had pork chops with onions and apples cooked in the crock pot.  I pan fried some sweet potatoes and had some green beans.  It was pretty good and I have figured out that I like the plain, old, bone in pork chops better than those thick, butterflied ones that are so popular these days.  He ate all of it and I am finding that he does better at eating my dinners when I don't try to make portions big enough to feed a farmer or somebody who does lots of physical labor.  I think I am getting the hang of it.Tonight I am having those tacos.  I have developed a recipe for crock pot taco meat that I am going to start in a little while.  I am going to make mexican rice so I can reheat it later and then mix up my salad.  Then, when we get home from babysitting I will be done and it will be ready.I guess I should take pictures of the food, shouldn't I?  I will try to remember.So, that is what is occupying my thoughts today."},

(eg. taking notes while reading, etc)Here is my Monday Musing response to \"I blogged about _________ this past week\".I blogged about a lot of things this week -- nothing earth shattering or particularly interesting but things that were impacting me personally. I remember when I first learned about blogs.  My son's friend, Mundee, had a blog.  I asked him what that was, he told me, and I immediately decided I wanted one as well.  I was intrigued.  I like to write so I decided this would be a perfect outlet for me.  I discovered almost as immediately that some days there was just nothing to write about.  I also discovered that was ok.Then came Facebook and I got hooked into that.  It is fun and yet it is just a bit evil.  It allows me to keep up with family and friends that I don't see often.  It also allows me to waste lots and lots of time.  I find it depressing a lot of the time because there is so much sadness and anger expressed there.  That might work for some but not for me. So, I have come back to my blog and I have discovered that I need to write something, anything, every day.  I try to do pictures.  I try to do memes like this when nothing is going on but I do try to be present every day.  I have a very small following and that is fine with me.  I correspond with my followers on a regular basis and call them friends.  So, while my writing doesn't span the vast horizons, it has allowed me to create my little corner of the world with like minded people and I can escape to this corner whenever I want and it brings me comfort and joy.With that, I invite you to join me at boyett-brinkley.blogspot.com."},
{"title": "Suggestions, please", "date": "Sunday, January 17, 2016", "text": "Before the holidays I read several suggestions for putting together bags for the homeless. I read about buying purses second hand and filling them full of necessary items for homeless women. There were generic suggestions of things to be put in ziplock bags for either men or women. All of these were good ideas. The idea behind it is, you fill whatever receptacle with whatever items you think are good, add a little bit of cash or a gift card and put them in your car to have at the ready so if you are in the situation to have the opportunity to help someone you are prepared.Well, ok, my problem is that I can't necessarily identify homeless people.  Some are obvious but I am sure many aren't.  However, on our way home in the late afternoon we regularly encounter a handicapped gentleman who is soliciting handouts.  I am usually very skeptical about people who appear to be \"begging\" -- I know for a fact that some of these people are scammers.  However, this man is missing limbs and I fear he is one of our veterans that needs help.  I can't tell if he is homeless or just needy.So, I have been thinking about it and have thought about the suggestions that I read about over the holidays and am thinking of putting together a ziplock bag with some things in it but not knowing his situation I don't know what to put in the bag! I don't know if he needs toiletries or food or what.  I was appalled not long ago because the person in the car threw money out he car window at him -- like they didn't actually want to get close to him.  Granted, he doesn't look very clean but I felt it was so demeaning.  He is sitting on the curb with a prosthetic leg and he is missing an arm and it was hard for him to try to catch the money that was blowing around.  I felt so bad for him.Any suggestions would be welcome because I feel drawn to help them man -- I am sure he isn't scamming anybody but I don't know how to help.  I won't throw money at him -- I believe he deserves better treatment than that -- but I would want to include things that would be useful.Thoughts?"},
{"title": "Reading in the New Year and Brussels Sprouts", "date": "Saturday, January 16, 2016", "text": "As I posted a while back, I am really trying to wean myself from Facebook somewhat and concentrate on my blog more as well as the blogs I read.  I have also wanted to pay more attention to Goodreads as they really have good information on there for new reading material.  That is causing me some stress as there are so many good books being shared.Due to the moving of the MIL I am a bit behind on my reading but I did start my new Jan Karon book -- \"Come Rain or Come Shine\". I have only read a bit of it but I can tell I am going to enjoy it as much as I have Karon's other books.  It isn't terribly long so I imagine it will be a quick read which I will hate because I don't like good books to end.However, I have been introduced to another title that has caught my eye -- \"The Children's Home\" by Charles Lambert. My cousin, JLSHall is reading it now andand gave a good review.  Another review compares it to Shirley Jackson's works which intrigues me because I am a huge Shirley Jackson fan -- well, except for \"The Lottery\". Don't read that.  Scary.  And depressing.  In any event, this title might be my next.I added \"Eleanor and Park\" by Rainbow Rowell from my daughter's to read list.Sometimes YA things are good and I like to read them from time to time.  I will have to get back to you on this.  But, I like the cover.Earlier today I was doing some surfing on the internet about the Paleo diet.  I am sort of interested in it as it is a good diet for diabetics, it seems.  My husband is diabetic and he is having a blood pressure problem right now so I am thinking that we both need a change in our diet.  I need to break the sugar habit in the worst way.  I was sugar free for a while -- well, added sugar.  Heaven only knows how much sugar is hidden in our food and the only way to get past that is to cook from scratch at home.  So, I am going to give it a go. A friend of mine suggested a website called dr.axe.com for news and recipes on health and diet and such.  In order to access it you have to leave off the \".\" after dr but draxe.com takes you right there.  I found a recipe for roasted brussels sprouts with apples and pecans and it sounds delightful.  I think I will be trying it for sure.  It makes a lot so you might want to cut it down but that is easily done.  I think it would be good with pork.And, right on schedule, the cedar pollen has arrived and blown up my nose so raging allergies coupled with the side effects of a difficult med, I am not feeling great.  However, when emptying my MIL's kitchen, I fell heir to her new bread machine and I think I am going to give it a try.  It is smaller than mine and I think it makes a horizontal loaf of bread which is what I have been looking for.  So, I might be doing that this evening.  I will let you know how it goes.The cookie sale did better than I thought it would at my house.  We had two people come by and buy several boxes.  I was surprised because I didn't really think I would have anybody so I was pleased.  Our HOA doesn't allow any solicitation -- even adorable 5 year old girls with cookies -- so I had to do it from my house.  That is why I was surprised that we had anybody.  We are doing it again tomorrow, though, so we will see.  Maybe my neighbors have had time to think about the cookie goodness and are now realizing what they missed!I have been good and not eaten any.  Really.So, that is it for Saturday! Back to my book and my tissues.So.....we have roasted turkeys, decorated trees and wrapped gifts, shot fireworks for the new year ... so what is next?  Valentines?  Any retail store will say that is true but there is something that comes before that.  An event that is much awaited.  And... it is here!Yes, it is cookie time.  Not great for my sugar detox and I am certain that I will have a freezer full of them by the end of the day but our little Daisy Scout is very enthusiastic about it so we will support her.  This sale is very important to these girls as they get a portion of the proceeds for their troop to allow them to do activities and have meaningful meetings.  I was a Brownie and I remember enjoying the time spent.  I even remember the cookies.  I remember my mother being the leader -- it was a good time for us.  So, if one of these sweeties knocks on your door or rings your bell be generous -- this means a lot to these kiddos.Keep calm -- the cookies are here!"},
{"title": "Life Changes", "date": "Friday, January 15, 2016", "text": "Life changes are just that -- changes that occur all through your life.  Some are natural and gradual -- like going from being a baby to being a child to being a grownup.  Some happen with intent like going from being single to married.  Some happen suddenly like when ageing physically changes your ability to function and, of course, the ultimate change which is death.  I won't be talking about death today because while there are preparations to be made for that eventuality, those are well documented.  I am talking about taking care of business for everybody in every stage of adult life - everyday sorts of things.Recently we had reason to seek out assisted living accommodations for my mother in law.  Fortunately they had just opened an assisted living unit at the retirement community that she was already in so it was just a matter of a whole load of paper work to secure a new apartment and then the moving of her belongings.  The new apartment is half the size of the old apartment so it goes without saying that there was a lot of paring down to be done.  I learned a lot along the way so I thought I would share some tips.1. EmotionsMy MIL and I were never close -- we were too different to ever forge a tight friendship -- she would never be my \"other mother\".  So, I was very surprised to find myself becoming emotional over going through her stuff.  So, if you are in the position to be dealing with another person or if you are thinking ahead to your own family dealing with your stuff, take steps to make it as easy as possible because it will make your life easier in the here and now as well.2.  LogicStore your things logically.  Have things where you can find them -- important papers should go in a file cabinet, drawer, or safe deposit box where you can get your hands on them.  Photos should be put in albums, photo boxes, or stored electronically where they can be located.  Clothing should be stored with like things together.  I never want my children to have that quizzical look on their face when they fish through my underwear drawer and find a lone, glittery, fish Christmas ornament.  3. Reasonable WardrobeKeep your clothing current, well tended to and stored logically.  If something is too small just toss it -- if it ever does fit again most likely it will be out of style or have lost its shape from hanging.  If something needs repair then repair it or get rid of it.  Have what you need to appeal to your sensibilities so you don't feel TOO minimal but seriously folks, if you have twelve pair of white slacks -- unless it is a uniform of some sort that you wear daily -- that is too much.  Reading some articles on minimal wardrobes would be helpful.  You can have too much of a good thing.4.  Household GoodsAssess your needs and look at your household.  Do you really need 40 towels?  Some families might and that is fine but if it is a small family be logical about your needs and your space.  Recently (like just as we started doing this with my MIL) I looked in my linen closets.  I chose two sets of sheets for each bed, appropriate blankets and quilts and two or three towel sets for each person.  That is what fits in my linen closet. Even if all of it were dirty it would still be a reasonable laundry load.  Don't fill your linen closet to overflowing and then start stuffing the excess in dresser drawers or the top of the closet just to keep it.  Have what you need an no more.The kitchen seems to be a dreadful place for excess.  We all have that one kitchen junk drawer and yes, I do too.  My husband seems to love to collect twist ties.  Remember, my husband is the first born child of the MIL who likes LOTS of stuff and the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  Again, assess your needs.  If you bake lots of muffins you are going to want tins.  However, if you rarely bake muffins then maybe six tins of various sizes is just a wee bit too many.  Have what you need, keep the best and get rid of the rest.5.  Cleaning ProductsCleaning products seem to multiply on their own in the dark.  Lots of people seem to think they need duplicates in each bathroom and the kitchen.  You don't.  While it is convenient, I suppose, it takes up valuable real estate under cabinets and just creates excess.  Buy a plastic caddy of some sort and keep your products to a minimum.  Tote it around the house and then store it away in the designated place.  It is a well known fact that I don't like chemicals and keep them to a minimum so my caddy would probably have baking soda, vinegar, and some microfiber cloths in it.  You don't need a lot of stuff but if you are going to have a lot of stuff in each area of the house be sure to discard the empty bottles and don't buy more until something is truly empty.6.  CosmeticsI have a problem with cosmetics -- I love to look at it and buy it but I don't wear much of it.  So,  a few days ago I purged my makeup drawer, bought some new organizers so I could actually find what I do use and I won't buy more until it is gone.  Here is the thing, people, cosmetics spoil.  You can't stockpile.  By the time you get done with one item the three or four that you have squirreled away might be on the edge of spoiling and you can't mistake it when it does -- the stench is terrible.  The thought of actually using something like that is just gross.  So, buy what you need and use it up.  You don't save money by buying ahead -- in fact, in most cases you lose money because you have to throw so much away.Also, don't keep empty bottles and jars.  What are you going to do with them.  Toss, toss, toss.  Cabinet space and counter space is prime real estate -- use it wisely.7.  Food.Ok, now this is a touchy subject.  Most of us don't go to the grocery store daily like our great-grandmothers did.  We like to keep food at hand.  I like that too.  I have even done some reading on \"prepping\", like for disasters.  The truth of the matter is that shopping to \"prep\" is totally different.  Storing up a lot of food \"just in case\" doesn't work because it isn't packaged for that sort of storage.  My mother used to grocery shop every two weeks except for milk which she would buy at the corner store when needed.  She had a freezer for meat and vegetables and a small pantry.  When she planned her meals, loosely, we used the food and we were ready to replenish at the next two week interval.  I remember her method -- we had our \"rich meals\" at the beginning of the two weeks -- roasts, chickens, etc, and our \"poor meals\" - beans and cornbread, stew, stuff like that, a day or two before grocery shopping.  When we had our poor meals she always had a pie or cake so those beans didn't seem TOO poor!  I still love those bean and cornbread meals and have them often myself.  When you have so much that you don't need, that you buy just because it looks good or to have on hand, you waste so much money.  I do pay attention to expiration dates on things and I don't hang on to anything past that date.  That is why scratch cooking is really preferable to buying processed foods -- it is easier to store, less chance of spoilage and less waste.  I mean, who is going to stock up on three months worth of cabbage? 8.  GiftsWhen we were at my great-grandmother's 100th birthday party I remember a conversation between my mother and my great-aunt on what would be an appropriate gift for Granny.  The answer was nothing.  Apparently Granny had so many gowns and robes they couldn't get the closet door shut and the top shelf of her closet was piled to the ceiling with boxes of bath powder that she wouldn't ever use.  So, be thoughtful when giving gifts.My daughter (a true minimalist) has always said consumable gifts are the best and I agree.  She likes to give me soap and I like to get it.  We routinely give gift cards for meals and I really like that.  I have gotten gift cards to buy books for my e-reader and I like that.  When you give somebody a gift, a good deal of the time, they feel obligated to keep it even if it has outlived it's purpose so be mindful of that.  While it may seem to be bad manners or gauche to give money, sometimes that is the best thing.  For instance, my mother in law doesn't need another THING in the world.  Because of all this activity at the holiday season we owe her a birthday gift and a Christmas gift.  We will be giving her money.  The new apartment place has a beautiful new salon and she is a beauty shop kind of gal -- she has the \"standing appointment\" mindset so she can always use cash for that.  She has a girl that takes her shopping so she always need some dough to grab them some lunch or something like that.  I don't see a problem with that but I do see a problem with adding one more knick-knack or piece of costume jewelry to the mix.  Not. Going. To. Happen. So, at the end of the day, I will have to say that what I have learned from this experience is to THINK.  Don't blindly store things away, don't buy more than you need, don't clutter your life or your space or your mind with too much.  I wish I had had the time to keep a running list with a dollar value of everything I threw away or donated from that apartment.  I am sure that what I unloaded out of the pantry would have been at least $500 worth of expired food.  Trying to put a value on the durable goods that were given away would have been in the thousands.  When I think of the money spent just to be, in essence, thrown away, it almost makes me scream.  There is no dollar amount to be placed on the effect that living with clutter has on you emotionally.  It steals your joy.  It steals your serenity.  It steals the confidence that you have control of your environment and your needs.  Clutter is just about as serious as stress in my book.  It is insidious and can be actually harmful. Hopefully my experience can help others.  I know it will help me.  As I look around my own house I see so many ways to make things better.  When my life changes happen I want my husband or kids to be able to walk in and identify where the family photos are, to look in my pantry and find it to be viable and healthy.  I want my family to be able to move my things or discard my things and not have to worry about throwing out my high school diploma with the 25 year old bank statements which are all shoved in a Christmas bag.Yes, people, think about it.  Be logical.  Stay on top of things.

This has been more gruelling than our move, 25 years ago, from San Antonio with two kids in tow.  I am happy to say, however, that most everything to be dealt with today is trash and we are going to make short work of it.  All cabinets and closets are empty.  The important stuff has found a new home.  I am completely exhausted as is my husband.  We have been out of our regular routine for almost two months now and it is taking it's toll. Seriously -- I haven't even watched last weeks episode of \"Downton Abbey\".  That is what I am talking about -- routine shot.However, I think I see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Maybe tomorrow will be a lovely blog about SOMETHING ELSE!"},
{"title": "Minimalist Wardrobe", "date": "Tuesday, January 12, 2016", "text": "I have learned a lot from this ordeal experience of moving another persons belongings. I have learned that we are all products of our generation. I have learned that personal taste in clothing and such is as personal as our fingerprints.My MIL is a product of the depression era.  She was born in 1921 so she was old enough and impressionable enough to be affected, even if not personally, by the depression.  She was raised on a central Texas farm that they owned, the child of Czech immigrants, and she always said that they, as a family, never really felt the full on force of the depression.  They grew their own food, they went to the community school which was worlds away from the big cities and the big city problems, they sewed, knitted, and dresses and shirts got passed from the bigs to the littles -- regardless of the state of the economy. However, I am sure that she wasn't completely oblivious to the plight of many people and maybe it was the depression or maybe it was the immigrant mindset but this lady can save things for decades after their purpose has been served.  She also, clearly, has always had the feeling that more is better.I was raised differently.  My mother was also a depression era child and because my grandfather worked for the railroad he always had work.  In 1928 they, as a family, bought a new house, a new car and had a new baby -- not too shabby in the time when the world was falling apart financially and the time between wars was way too short.  However, my mother didn't cling to material things. As I was growing up in the 1950's it was a common occurrence to come home to the furniture all being rearranged, new drapes and linens bought and installed, things painted and everything smelling of Clorox bleach and Lysol.  My mother didn't like things to stay the same for too long! We routinely cleaned out closets and discarded all manner of things.  We lived in what would today be called a tiny house so there was no place to store multitudes of things so out with the semi-old and in came the new. I don't remember my mother ever actually wearing something out.  Breaking things, yes, but wearing it out, no.Both of these ladies have shown clear evidence of a shopping problem. One is a hoarder, the other a tosser.Both of them are, in my humble opinion, wrong.There has to be a balance and I have been doing a lot of thinking about this.As I said prior, we are all products of our generations.  I was a child of the 50's and a teenager in the 60's.  We all loved Twiggy, Carnaby Street and we all tried to be anorexic.  In my case that didn't work and I am still dealing with it.  I regress.  At any rate, when I was a teenager, it seemed that we thought in terms of outfits -- we would buy a dress (many granny dresses or baby dresses), buy the tights, the shoes, the hair decoration and we had an outfit.  I still think that way.  I buy outfits.  However, today's mindset is toward capsule wardrobes where everything is in a color scheme to go with everything else and mix and match.  I simply can't get my head around that -- I still think in terms of outfits.So, this is my plan.  I am going through my wardrobe and toss virtually everything.  I am going to plan and purchase six outfits to wear every day of the week -- a uniform so to speak.  It is probably going to be jeans and button down shirts as that is what I pretty much live in.  Then, I am going to find a couple of outfits (shopping my own closet for this) for church or dressier occasions.  I have a new winter coat that I bought from TravelSmith -- it is a khaki trench coat with a button in liner -- raincoat or heavy coat and it is warm.  I have two sweaters.  I am going to be able to put it all in one place in my closet and I will be able to get the laundry done in a couple of loads.  I am going to arrange these outfits on a hanger -- shirts on top of pants -- and that way I will have a minimal amount of hanging stuff.  Everything will be folded a la Marie Kondo and I am going to be done.  I have enough shoes to do me except for a pair of summer sandals which I will purchase in a neutral color -- ONE pair of sandals.This is my plan.  I don't know if it will work and I am going to try to purchase these things with the new trend in mind that it is preferable to buy to own forever which means the quality would need to be as good as possible falling within financial restrictions.  My closet isn't over crowded right now but I do need to replace some things that are getting worn out and I think this would be a good way to approach it rather than just buying things willy nilly.I will let you know how it goes and maybe even snap a photo.  Maybe."},
{"title": "Moving Day Number -- oh who knows anymore", "date": "Monday, January 11, 2016", "text": "Moving my MIL to an assisted living apartment is like the never ending project.  It took us the entire day to move her clothes from one the old apt. to the new apt. which is just across the parking lot -- she had to look at each piece and determine whether it would stay or go -- she had to pare down because she just didn't have as much closet space.  It. took. all. day.  She has two closets in the new apartment and they are now full to the brim.  We are toting six medium size (18 X 18 X 16) moving boxes full of clothes to the charity shop tomorrow.  In the process of clearing out one closet we found six more boxes and one bag full of clothes that we didn't know was there.  We are about to lose our minds.I have learned so much about minimal living from this experience.  Much more than I ever learned from reading books or blogs or articles.  At one point this afternoon I was musing about how Marie Kondo would handle this situation.  I am sure she wouldn't have felt like running away -- she probably would have enjoyed the experience.  I did not. So, when I get finished dealing with MIL's possessions I am moving on to my own.  I am not ever going to have my kids go mad going through my junk."},
{"title": "Oh My Goodness --", "date": "Saturday, January 09, 2016", "text": "Moving Day 2Oh my gosh -- I am so tired.  I wish we had had more time for all of this -- it is more than a two day job.  Going through another person's belongings is a difficult process -- especially since the person is still living and is probably not going to be happy about all the changes although she asked for all the changes.This move is going to be better for my mother in law but I am afraid that we are all going to be in deep you-know-what when she can't locate all her stuff that just isn't in her possession anymore.  I know we are going to go through that awkward period when she is angry with us for doing what she asked us to do.This is definitely one of those \"can't win for losing\" times.Sigh.Clearly I survived the first day of moving.  The day was spent moving the large pieces of furniture that were to go to the new apartment.  A few smaller things were moved but the bulk of the day was spent with the big stuff.The day started roughly at 8 a.m. and ended about 13 hours later with lunch and dinner breaks.  My main job was to observe so that nobody got hurt.  I mean, after all, these guys (my husband and brother-in-law) aren't teenagers anymore -- just sayin'.  You wouldn't think that moving things across the parking lot would be so tiring.  Well, it is.Today we face the hard part -- trying to figure out how to pare down clothing and sort paperwork and stuff like that.  MIL doesn't have a full kitchen in the new place so kitchen stuff will be minimal -- some plates, glasses, cups and bowls.  A bit of silverware, a couple of cup towels.  And the microwave.  Can't forget the microwave.I have done pretty well until last night.  I had a totally freaked out episode, almost a toddler melt down and all over a pair of tweezers.  My MIL had been pounding into my head to get a small dish with a special pair of tweezers.  I don't see anything special about these tweezers but beauty is in the eye of the beholder after all.  So, my last trip from Apt. 1 to Apt. 2 I decided to just grab the dish and hand carry it over.  All was good until I got into the elevator with two ladies on scooters and one bumped me and sent the tweezers flying.  I just knew they fell through the gap down the elevator shaft.  I went back to each floor just to check and by this time I was having a fit.  I got to Apt. 2 and my partners in crime tried to calm me down but I was frantic.  This was the ONE thing my MIL said we had to get without doubt! So, I dumped out my purse and by golly those tweezers never hit the floor but ended up in my purse.  I couldn't believe it! After that incident, I was done and just need my bed and a nice cuppa.So, today we start again.  Yay!I am just glad I wasn't a part of MIL's move from SA to FT. W 7 years ago when she broke up housekeeping in the house she had lived in since 1953.  From what I understand, that purging was a bear!  I am just glad I had to deal with tweezers."},
{"title": "Moving Day", "date": "Friday, January 08, 2016", "text": "Not for me but for my mother in law.  Several months ago my MIL got sick. All manner of tests were done to no avail.  She was on the decline -- \"adult failure to thrive\" was the diagnosis.  She was hospitalized with malnutrition and dehydration -- not something you would expect to see in a first world woman of above average means. It seems she was just quitting.  Everything.  Including eating and drinking. Between Thanksgiving and Christmas she was hospitalized twice in a week.  At the end of the second stay she was being released and wanted to go home but the closer it got to actually going home she was having doubts so the doctor arranged for a three week stay at a nearby rehabilitation center.  While there we broached the subject of her moving from her apartment in an independent living retirement facility to an assisted living apartment in the same place.  It is a new wing -- all shiny and bright -- and she agreed completely.  She even asked if we could make it happen before she was released from rehab so she could just go to the new place.So, for the last three weeks my husband has been jumping through hoops to make this happen.  The new apartment has been chosen and secured.  We have two old men (my husband and brother-in-law) and one old, decrepit lady (me) to help and we have a day planned for sure.  Hopefully this will be mostly taken care of today and tomorrow to be finished up on Sunday.  Looking for MIL's release from rehab to be Monday or Tuesday. If you don't hear from me in a couple of days just check at the rehab -- after all this moving I might be occupying the room that is going to be available."},
{"title": "Chalking the Door -- I will be doing this if I can find the chalk -- and climb high enough", "date": "Thursday, January 07, 2016", "text": "Chalking the Door: An Epiphany House Blessing 2016Daryl Moresco, OCarm. | January 1, 2016Every year the Carmelite Pre-novitiate Community at Carith House in Chicago on the Feast of the Epiphany blesses their home. We invite you to adopt this custom in your family. The family gathers to ask God’s blessing on their home and on those who live in or visit the home. It is an invitation for Jesus to be a daily guest in our home, our comings and goings, our conversations, our work and play, our joys and sorrows.A traditional way of doing this is to use chalk to write above the home’s entrance, 20 + C + M + B + 16. The letters C, M, B have two meanings. They are the initials of the traditional names of the three magi: Caspar, Melchior, and Balthazar. They also abbreviate the Latin words Christus mansionem benedicat, “May Christ bless the house.” The “+” signs represent the cross and 2016 is the year.Blessing the ChalkV. Our help is the name of the Lord:R. The maker of heaven and earth.V. The Lord shall watch over your going out and your coming in:R. From this time forth for evermore.Let us pray.Loving God, bless this chalk which you have created, that it may be helpful to your people; and grant that through the invocation of your most Holy Name that we who use it in faith to write upon the door of our home the names of your holy ones Caspar, Melchior, and Balthazar, may receive health of body and protection of soul for all who dwell in or visit our home; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.Instructions for Blessing the HomeUsing the blessed chalk mark the lintel of your front door (or front porch step) as follows:20 + C + M + B + 16 while saying:The three Wise Men, Caspar, Melchior, and Balthazar followed the star of God’s Son who became human two thousand and fifteen years ago. May Christ bless our home and remain with us throughout the new year. Amen.Then offer the following prayer: Visit, O blessed Lord, this home with the gladness of your presence. Bless all who live or visit here with the gift of your love; and grant that we may manifest your love to each other and to all whose lives we touch. May we grow in grace and in the knowledge and love of you; guide, comfort, and strengthen us in peace, O Jesus Christ, now and forever. Amen“Chalking the door” is a way to celebrate and literally mark the occasion of the Epiphany and God’s blessing of our lives and home. With time the chalk will fade. As it does we let the meaning of the symbols written sink into the depths of our heart and be manifest in our words and actions the Latin words, Christus mansionem benedictat, “May Christ bless the house.”  Daryl Moresco, OCarm.Br. Daryl Moresco OCarm. is the Director of Vocations and the Pre-Novitiate formation program for the Province of the Most Pure Heart of Mary (Chicago) Province.» See all posts by Daryl  I am a voracious reader.  I am also well known for choosing books for their covers.  I think that is why I still prefer physical books to e-books - the covers.  A while back, while perusing the sale tables at B&N I picked up a copy of \"The House on Fortune Street\" by Margot Livesey.  It was put on the shelf  to wait its turn in the TBR queue.  My daughter came over one day looking for something to read and she took several books off the shelf, this one being one of them, and it resided at her home for a long while.  Recently, it came back into my possession, was thrown in the back of the car and brought out one day when I was needing something to read while waiting in the kindergarten pick up express line.I always liked the cover so I assumed I would like the book.  For the first time in forever, that didn't happen.  It was a slow go.  It was a chore to get started and keep the momentum going.  It just didn't grab me but I was determined.  After plodding through the beginning and suffering through a story line I didn't enjoy it started to get better.  Around the middle of the book it started to grow on me -- the overlapping of the story lines was intriguing.  It was almost a mystery without actually being one.  And now -- at the end -- I found I couldn't put it down.  What clever writing it was.  What complicated characters they were.  To see the story unfold for each of the character's viewpoints was enlightening.It is the story of Abigail and Dara -- friends from college days.  They were different yet so much alike.   They were best friends and their individual stories ran parallel to their story.  Through the whole book, through parents and families and lovers and friends, their relationship remained until the end.  And what a sad end it was.Would I recommend this book?  I am not sure.  It was a slow start, it was a sad end, the writing was excellent, the characterization and the setting were top notch and I have really enjoyed it, surprisingly.  However, it is a sad book and a depressing read so I would have to withhold my recommendation.  A reader would have to decide for him/herself."},

{"title": "RIP Poor Dead Camera", "date": "Tuesday, January 05, 2016", "text": "My camera died.  I didn't realize it was on the brink of demise -- I thought it was only missing a few screws and needed a good battery charge.  I thought that replacement screws and a good while on the charger would fix everything and that we could be friends again.   Seems not to be because when I took it off the charger and walked outside to photograph the sun, it wouldn't work.  It had a brand new battery purchased just a few months ago and the front was properly secured again but it wouldn't open, it wouldn't do anything.So, off to Best Buy I go to replace my friend of several years now.  This is the new camera I adopted.I comes in other lovely colors but there were none left from the holidays.  I am fine with basic black, however.  Not such a change from my little Kodak whatever-it-was.  I prefer little point and shoot cameras that I can carry in my purse to the large, dramatic, impressive equipment that all the men in the family carry.  They all tote around these impossibly large cameras with larger lenses and we seem to have very few photos! I, on the other hand, happily snap away with my little camera and I like it that way.I am not sure how this is going to go -- the relationship is too new, too untested.  Right now the camera -- I haven't even decided on a name yet -- is asleep on the desk charging.  As soon as it warms up a bit outside I will be taking her on a trial run to see what she can do.  She is WiFi enabled -- whatever that means -- not sure how that will help me.  I guess I can connect the camera directly to the computer and download the pics to the hard drive -- hmm..my netbook doesn't have a hard drive.  Ok, maybe I can download them to Shotwell.  Seems this is going to take some time spent with the manual -- I hate manuals but it least it actually came with one.  One of my other options didn't have a manual but rather you had to download it from the computer. So, there you go -- a new year, a new member of my purse family and a new learning curve.  Hopefully this little camera will last as long as the other one did and that we will learn to live together peaceably. Hope -- is that a good name for a camera?Teaser Tuesday is a weekly bookish meme, hosted by MizB of A Daily Rhythm. Anyone can play along! Just do the following:• Grab your current read• Open to a random page• Share two (2) “teaser” sentences from somewhere on that page• BE CAREFUL NOT TO INCLUDE SPOILERS! (make sure that what you share doesn’t give too much away! You don’t want to ruin the book for others!)• Share the title & author, too, so that other TT participants can add the book to their TBR Lists if they like your teasers!My teaser comes from \"The House on Fortune Street\" by Margot Livesey, page 199.\"For all her many visits to Abigail's house, Dara ha never seen the ground floor flat.  As she bicycled over, she pictured it as similar to the upstairs:  light, beautifully proportioned, tastefully decorated.\"Hmmm..the upstairs sounds like something out of House Beautiful and it makes you wonder if the downstairs flat is somewhat of a dungeon. This is where I am in the book at the moment.  It has been a slow read, started in November and will be the first on my Goodreads challenge list for 2016.  It is picking up and I am anxious to see how all the pieces fit together because it is truly like a puzzle."},

I never have much important to say but I feel like I have let my blog slide in favor of Facebook and, while FB has it's place, I suppose, it is getting very depressing and sad and one of my goals for the new year is to concentrate on my blog more.  I can't give up FB because that is how I keep up with family and distant friends but too much time is spent THERE and too little time spent HERE.  Must. fix. that.This week's random question --What do you do when you finish a book?

I asked my husband how many cup towels a self respecting home should have and he said four -- two in use and two in the drawer.  I think that is just a tad sparse but I am going to narrow down my two drawers full of cup towels to probably just a half dozen.  It is two of us here, I don't think we need more.It will probably take me until next New Years to accomplish this but I am going to declutter every nook and cranny in this house -- starting with the linen closets -- it looks so nice to open the door and have my sheets in nice stacks all straightened up.  I feel so accomplished.I hope I can keep up the momentum!"},

If my kids didn't live here, I would move back.  The weather wasn't perfect there but at least we didn't have as much threatening weather from tornadoes to ice. What is up next?  Well, we are going to have more rain today - and wind -- and then tonight it is going to get cold and we might have a snowflake.  They said if there was any snow it wouldn't accumulate and it wouldn't be a problem.  When they say that, it is time to go to the grocery store and stock up for the blizzard because they ARE. ALWAYS. WRONG. So, just wanted to let anybody who was wondering know that we are fine and hopefully the tornado activity is over."},
{"title": "Merry Christmas!", "date": "Friday, December 25, 2015", "text": "The last 25 days have been spent waiting for Christmas.  There have been quiet times, candle lightings,  gospel lessons, nativity building and anticipation.  Today was the culmination of all those things as we welcomed the new born babe and celebrated with gifts and food.I usually have a problem with depression at some point during the holiday season and this year has been no different.  There was one day a couple of weeks ago and then again today.  I don't know why, a let down perhaps.  Even though we try to emphasize the real meaning of Christmas and not dwell on the material side of it there is still that moment of realization that all the planning and working is over in the blink of an eye.  I know that \"Christmas\" is just beginning with twelve days to follow but being raised in America it was our tradition to celebrate on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day and then it was done and we readied ourselves for the New Year.So, today, as I was making the final preparations for our dinner and final lighting of the Advent candles I was already thinking ahead toward the New Year and things I want to accomplish.  I don't believe in resolutions -- it is like they are made just to be broken.  I much prefer plans and goals.I have a few of those for the new year -- some big, some not so big, so long term and some to bring closure.  One of my goals this year is to be a better blogger.  I have a few things I would like to incorporate here at Maison Brinkley -- both personally and for the household in general.  I am going to make a more concerted effort to actually document them here with photographs.Photographs -- hmm...that reminds me, it seems that three of the four screws in the front of my camera have fallen out and my camera is in grave danger of just disintegrating so I might have to think about a new one.  In any event, I am hoping to do better with the blog.I am also rethinking reading challenges.  This year I signed up for several and wasn't particularly successful with most so 2016 will find me participating in only one.  I have several series that I would have loved to have finished this year but didn't so I will continue with those this year.  I have learned that reading challenges are sort of double edged sword.  On one hand they sort of force you to read more but I wonder if, in doing that, we don't read as well and get as much out of the books as we could if we took more time.  I don't know but I do know that I am going to do only one.I am also giving more thought to household things such as tidying, decluttering and meal planning and prepping.  I have recently read an interesting article that takes meal planning a step farther and concentrates on prepping and pre-cooking some things.  I found it fascinating and am going to give that a go and see if it can help me prepare an evening meal with limited time.  The Hubs and I both need to lose a little (haha!) weight and get more exercise so that is a huge goal of the new year. But, for tonight, I am taking my book, heading to my bed and going to lose myself in a good read. I hope all of you had a wonderful Christmas and look forward to great weekend!"},

{"title": "Hello! Remember Me?", "date": "Tuesday, December 22, 2015", "text": "Hello there!  Remember me -- Melissa -- the blogger gone AWOL?  Yes, well, things have been busy -- I try not to say hectic because that isn't really accurate, just busy.  As the week progresses I feel things winding down and getting a bit calmer -- I mean, time is running out for all the manic shopping and wrapping and all that and I can feel the excitement of Christmas Day creeping in.  I am ready in all sorts of ways -- last gift bought, everything wrapped, the ham ordered and the house cleaned -- well, ok, that is a gross exaggeration -- the house is not cleaned and there is wrapping paper bits everywhere! But, a girl can dream, can't she?This week has been really crazy -- my mother in law was hospitalized twice in the week and has now been released to a local rehab center.  She was transported by a transport service that didn't get her to the new facility until 11 p.m.  She isn't particularly happy and my husband and I are exhausted.  The original plan was for her to just go home to her apartment but after talking with her she was concerned about being too weak to do for herself and so the decision to go home was re-visited and it was decided she would go to rehab to try to get her back on her feet.  Hubs will check on her this morning and I hope she has a more positive view of the situation than she did last night.  It would help if they can find her a private room.  She isn't the roomie sort. So, yeah, hopefully that will work out better as we go along.I purchased my last gift yesterday.  It is for a very special little girl named Emily.  This is Lisa, a Ragtales doll that I found at a local, indie book store -- Monkey and Dog -- owned by a friend of mine, Shelley Lowe.  LilyI actually went for Odette -- a Jellycat ostrich but Odette had found her forever home.  I decided that Lisa would be a better choice as she doesn't have feathers and even though I loved Odette, I decided that Lisa would be very loved in her new forever home.OdetteSo, that was the last of the shopping -- Hubs and I have each bought one another a couple of things but the fact of the matter is that we are so blessed that there is really nothing we need or especially want -- we have enough -- we have each other, we are reasonably healthy, we have wonderful kids and grandkids, we have a roof over our heads and food in our tummies, some really good friends a wonderful, warm church  and what more could we ask for.So, as I try to recoup from my long night at the rehab I am going to share this beautiful picture from Christmas past -- about four years ago.  It makes me smile.Beanie"},

{"title": "Quiet Monday, Hectic Weekend, and Everybody is Sick", "date": "Monday, November 16, 2015", "text": "Last week, oh, I think Thursday, the wind blew.  Like a hurricane.  And I, brilliant soul that I am, was out walking around in it.  Now, I am an old lady (hee hee) and have known for many years that I can't handle real air very well and definitely not windy air. So, I should have known better but I had to walk into the school to get Bean and I had no choice. It didn't take but a few hours for whatever blew up my nose to start bothering me.  I was allergy sick.  Then the Hubs followed suit, then Bean and now dear daughter.  We all have it and we all feel miserable but, as they say, the show must go on.This weekend was a bit hectic.  My mother in law will be celebrating her 94th birthday on Wednesday so this weekend we had a reunion of sorts.  She has four children, all still living, four in-law children, eleven grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.  All but a few came for this little reunion.We had a lovely dinner at Cousin's Barbecue on Saturday night followed by cake in the activity center at her retirement community.  Yesterday, most reconvened to have lunch -- fajitas from Rosa's -- and more fellowship.  It was a good time and I think she enjoyed it. Three of her granddaughters were captured in this lovely photoJan, Bri and Jill My daughter posted this photo on FB saying that all they needed was Sarah, Rachel and Rebecca.  Well, they couldn't attend but they sent their picture to be part of it all and here they are --Rachel, Sarah and Rebecca All such beautiful girls -- I wish they could have all been together for a photo.And, some of the younger generation --Mateo, Bean and DanteNothing like bonding over video games -- Spy Mouse specifically.It was a good day -- hopefully there will be a repeat next year."},
{"title": "Oh, It's Sewing Time Again.....", "date": "Wednesday, November 11, 2015", "text": "Most everybody who reads my blog knows about Bean.  What most people don't know is that I have three other grandchildren -- Nathan, 8 1/2 yrs., Kathryn, 7 yrs. and Emily who is about to reach a milestone birthday -- 1 yr.I don't talk about these three grandchildren much because their parents don't want their photos on the internet.  I completely understand that and I completely respect that.  I am very careful when putting most any photos up anyway and I certainly don't want to go against their wishes.However, my daughter-in-law contacted me last week and was wondering if I would be interested in making coordinating outfits for K and E for an upcoming autumnal photo op.  I said sure but time was short so it would have to be something very simple.  I sew but I am not all that great so I didn't want to bite off more than I could chew for the time allotted.We decided on a simple little skirt for K in autumn colors.  I went to my favorite quilting shop -- Quilter's Stash in Hurst -- and found this lovely French General fabric from Moda.  The finish is almost that of a polished cotton although not quite.  It lost a bit of that finish when I washed it prior to sewing but washing is necessary as I don't want it to shrink the first time out of the box.  So, here is the little 1 hour skirt.Since I was sewing and going by measurement only, without the children, it is a guess that it will fit.  I went by Mom's measurements though so hoping for the best.And, for E, I decided on a coordinating fabric to be made up into one of those little jumpers/dresses that lap over the shoulder and button.  I used to make these, romper style, for E's father when he was little -- complete with grippers in the crotch -- so I am familiar with the style.  So, here it is as well.It is much smaller than it looks here and I am sorry for my glare-y white freezer in the background.  This fabric is from the same French General collection and the colors, of course, match perfectly.E is going to wear this as a jumper over a tee or onesie in cream and K will be wearing her skirt with a cream turtleneck or something similar.  Our weather has turned colder now and so something long sleeved would be appropriate and I think they are going to be very cute in their fall photos.I wish I could show you a photo of the girls in the outfits but unfortunately that can't happen.  I am just hoping that the measurements were correct and that they fit them.  I think they turned out lovely and will be a nice complement to a photo session in this nice, crispy weather."},
{"title": "Everything Old is New Again", "date": "Saturday, November 07, 2015", "text": "It recently occurred to me that I have sort of been a \"sandwich generation\" person all my life in all sorts of ways.  I was smack in the middle of myself and four cousins -- all girls -- and the only brunette.  I spent my 40's sandwiched between caring for children and caring for ageing parents.  I am spending my 60's caring for grandchildren and very aged mother-in-law (although there isn't a lot of caretaking going on as much as being \"on hold\" for any emergency).It also came to my mind that I am a \"sandwich generation\" person in another respect.  Being a baby boomer I have lived in the middle of post-war times and the technological age.  This is where things get dicey.When growing up, in the 1950's, we lived a modern life.  We had indoor plumbing, refrigeration, freezers, cars, vacuum cleaners, washers, dishwashers, radio, television, two newspapers and mail delivery.  I don't remember life without these things and now we can add all the more modern amenities to that list -- computers, cell phones, tablets, e-readers, digital everything - it is mind boggling.So, why, when I have never known a time when I didn't have modern conveniences would I be gradually employing  methods of doing things that belonged to my grandmother's generation? For instance, grocery shopping.  I have a large fridge/freezer and a supplemental freezer in my laundry room.  My idea of stocking a pantry is buying up a ton of canned goods, dried items like beans, rice, fruit, copious amounts of flour, sugar, baking supplies -- I like to cook from raw ingredients rather than processed mixes -- however, we can't really do that anymore, now can we with the BPA in the cans.  Buy frozen?  Yes, that is one solution.  But, I find myself throwing out so much produce that I am inclined to shop like our grandmother's generation did -- every couple of days.  I really don't like grocery shopping so that would sound like a nightmare, wouldn't it? It sort of is but not nearly the nightmare of worrying about poisoning yourself with canned food.  Hmmm.  Quite the dilemma.And then there is the housekeeping.  I make my own laundry detergent -- there is something comforting about knowing what goes in that since it is up against your skin and skin absorbs everything.  I actually like doing it.  But vacuuming is another story.  I have a lovely little vacuum cleaner - she is red and her name is Ruby.  She is a Miele and cleans like a dream.  However, more times than not I find myself with broom or dust mop in hand, dust cloth swishing the furniture.  Why?  Why have I morphed into my mother -- every time I get out the dust mop I see my mother with hers madly cleaning our original \"tiny\" house.  My aunt wasn't like that - she loved her vacuum cleaner.  My mother, not so much.  Maybe it is genetic? Ever since we re-vamped our television viewing opportunity -- chopped the daylights out of cable and went back to an antenna, Roku and Tivo -- I have turned the tv off. It no longer runs 24/7.  My house now feels like my childhood home - we didn't have the tv on all day, just when some specific soaps were on -- I distinctly remember \"Secret Storm\" and \"The Edge of Night\".  We only had three channels back in the 1950's and it signed off at midnight so our viewing pleasure was limited at best.  We read alot, did cross word puzzles, played games and such.  Now I am reading a lot, doing cross word puzzles, and playing games even though one of them is electronic. Oh, and puzzles -- love puzzles.I have had a love/hate relationship with technology since it first came into my home.  I have had every generation Nook that has been manufactured and I might add the last one is a complete bust.  I do like the Nook Glo-light for reading but the rest of them are sort of miserable.  I have been looking at an ipad or a kindle but I really like my little netbook and have opted to not replace the Nooks yet -- maybe something about me still carrying physical books around has something to do with it.  I prefer physical books.  Yes, they are harder to tote around and I can't carry a whole library in my purse but I can't read a whole library at one time either. So, this morning as I stood at the sink washing a load of dishes -- by hand rather than loading the dishwasher -- it occurred to me why I am travelling back in time so to speak. Comfort.I see my mother and my grandmother.  Doing things the old fashioned way reminds me of a gentler, less complicated, and yes, probably happier, time.  Not that I am not happy, I am very happy and I am very blessed, but the world was happier.  I feel like I can draw the drapes, put on the radio, wash my dishes and close out all the bad going on in the world.  It must be contagious because the other day, in the car, I was trying to interest Bean in listening to a CD but her response was \"oh, Nona, just put on the radio\"! So, I will probably go on doing things the \"old fashioned\" way, dating myself and making myself feel like an dotty old lady but that seems to be my happy place as I keep going back there more and more -- lot cheaper than therapy, wouldn't you say?Now, I am off to the store."},
{"title": "1 November 1969", "date": "Sunday, November 01, 2015", "text": "Today is the 46th anniversary of the passing of my grandfather, James William Davis.My grandfather was born in 1896 in Scranton, Pennsylvania to James W. Davies and Dinah Webb Davies.  He was one of twelve children born to the couple and the second born in the United States.  James Sr. and Dinah immigrated to Pennsylvania in 1889 or 90 (sources vary) with three children in tow, at least three left buried in Wales and then went on to have several more here.Their name was \"Davies\" but when starting school, the \"sister school\" as he called it (the neighborhood Catholic school, probably St. Ann's), his name was inadvertently spelled  \"Davis\" and he remained a \"Davis\" for evermore.He was not a large man.  He stood 5'4\" in his prime and he still wore a boys size shoe at his death.  His height shouldn't have been a surprise to anybody as his mother could stand upright under his outstretched arm.  Of his own four children, the tallest grew to be 5'6\".  What he lacked in stature he made up for in spirit -- as did all of his children.  A feisty bunch they were.  Many people said my grandfather was mean and I have to admit that I can see where he would come across that way but he was never mean to me.  However, if you slammed the back screen door too many times he would get annoyed and let you know not to do it again but mean?  No.In fact, I adored him.  I always felt very secure with him.  There were many times when I was hurt or sick that he was the one to haul me to the doctor's office.  There were times when I needed something for school and he was the one that would make it.  I remember one time we were in the yard picking up pecans  -- well, he was picking them up and I was toddling behind him pushing pecans back into the ground -- those little trees were still coming up when he passed away. One of my favorite things to do with him was eat.  They had a small kitchen with a little drop-leaf table and we would eat together.  My mom and I went to their house almost daily -- they just lived on the next street (you could see their house from our backyard) and we would eat pork and beans, or fried potatoes but the best thing was the Welsh rarebit.  He didn't put beer in it but he had a little tiny pan that he would melt that cheese in and spread it on toast and it was delightful! And tea and toast.  Always tea and toast.I wish that I had talked more to my grandfather about his childhood, his life in Pennsylvania, his life in the mines at age 11.  I wish I had known more about his parents and relationships with his siblings.  I got snippits, of course, and can visualize a bit but I wish I had been more aggressive in my questions.  But, I am thankful for what I know, thankful he was my grandfather and such a big part of my life and thankful for the things I learned from him.  I miss him to this day.Oh, by the way, I still have the little drop leaf table.I miss you PaPa."},
{"title": "And Here's the Reason Why", "date": "Saturday, October 31, 2015", "text": "I have been absent from this blog for a bit and here's the reason why.  I have been busy sewing.  I am still sewing but thought I would share a bit of what I have been doing.  This is ALL I have been doing, I haven't even been reading and that is something because that is my all-time favorite pastime.  So, here are a few of my creations  -- haha -- sounds like some sort of designer-speak and that I am truly NOT.  But anyway, here is what I have been doing for the last several weeks.First off, I made a little slip for Bean.  You can't just go into Sears and buy 2 packs of little slips for little girls anymore (you can buy them online from Mennonite women who charge a lot of money for them).  So, rather than line the dresses, I decided to just create a little slip.  I used a really soft cotton/poly batiste for this -- the same thing I have used to line dresses before and it worked well.  I just adjusted the dress pattern -- lowered the neckline, enlarged the armholes a bit , and shortened it enough to be shorter than the dress (no draggy petticoats here!) and voila -- a slip.  I bound the neck and armholes with single fold bias tape and made a placket in the back with a button on it.  Unfortunately I didn't have any cute little white buttons  so it is closed with a hot pink heart shaped button that I didn't take a picture of because I will probably replace it at some point.Sorry for the lousy photo quality but I did do a bit of decorative stitching down the sides of the placket -- the first and only time I have used the deco stitches on my machine.  I am such a trend setter.Here is the dress.  It looks a bit like a gunny sack here but Bean really likes little a-line dresses.  This pattern went together like a dream -- probably the first time in all my years of sewing that THAT happened.  It is a cute little medallion print with some little buttons.  I would have put more detail on it but my daughter is very much the minimalist so I am keeping things simple.  It fits her really well and now that the weather has cooled so much she will have to wear a sweater with it.  There is a long sleeve option which I might use if I make more.And last, for definitely not least, here is our little \"saint\" costume.  You can't see the detail but that dress has a sweetheart waistline.  What a pain!  I had to alter a pilgrim collar to create the cape but the mop cap pattern worked great for the hat. And, without further adieu---Meet our version of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton -- an American saint who lived during Revolutionary War years, was an Episcopalian, married with four children.  She was introduced to Catholicism in Italy after the death of her husband.  She lost two of her four children and went on to become a nun, form an order of sisters, start several schools and was sainted in 1979. Bean is very inappropriately wearing one of my hand tied rosaries around her neck but it wasn't long enough to tie around her waist so, they improvised. That cutie in the coral shirt is MY baby!So, folks, that is what has been going on here.  Who knew that creating three little things could so totally destroy a house, make a mess that has taken me days to straighten up and robbed of me of my reading guilty pleasure. On to the next project."},
{"title": "Miss Me Yet?", "date": "Saturday, October 24, 2015", "text": "For anybody who might be looking for me I have gone on a bit of a sabbatical.  I am trying to finish some sewing so I have had to curtail my computer fun for a while.  It seems that getting online \"for a minute\" morphs into hours and hours and I don't get anything else done.  So....yes, I am taking a bit of a break.I had two little dresses to make - I have completed one.  I had the saint costume to make -- that is completed except for ribbons on the hat.  I had to sew Girl Scout badges on the vest -- now I remember how dreadful that is.  I have two quilts to finish.So, I decided to start another project! Of course!  I have ranted and raved here in the past about the inability to find some essential articles of clothing so I decided to take the situation into my own hands.  You can no longer buy little girls underslips.  Oh, you can if you want to purchase online from Gehman's Country Fabrics in Lebanon, Pennsylvania.  A little girl's slip is $7.99.  However, you can't go to the mall, to Sears, and buy the two-to-a-package little slips anymore.  I went to Joann Fabrics armed with a coupon and purchased enough batiste to make two slips.  I have used this fabric before to line some little dresses but I didn't want to do that -- I wanted a slip.  So, I altered the dress pattern I was using -- a little shift dress -- cut out the armholes a bit and the cut the neck down.  I created a placket in the back seam, bound the neck and armholes and will add either a button or a hook and eye and voila! a slip.  It is very soft fabric and I think it will work well to add just a nice little layer.  I will take a photo when I finish. Anyway, that is what I am up to and I am on a roll -- if I stop I may never start again.  So...back to the machine.  Be back soon!"},

{"title": "Decluttering -- Other than the Closets and Drawers", "date": "Tuesday, October 13, 2015", "text": "Lately I have felt overwhelmed and I am not sure why.  Yes, looming health questions are playing havoc with my nerves but that isn't all of it.  I just feel overwhelmed.  Things are bothering me.Noise bothers me.  When I was a child growing up we always had the radio or the television going.  My father kept late hours so when I went to bed it was never silent.  The day I got married and went to my apartment with my new husband was a day I will never forget -- for obvious reasons -- but some not very obvious ones as well.  As we retired for the night we shut down the apartment and I became very aware, disturbingly aware of how dark and quiet it was. I was almost frightened.  It was so different than what I was used to.  I remember childhood days with the windows open blowing the white organdy curtains.  I remember smelling the little wildflowers that grew in our unlandscaped back yard.  I remember the smell of the air after it rained.  I remember the jingle of the Tiner's ice cream truck and the kids playing in the yard.  When did these lovely sounds and smells get replaced with noise.  Just noise.  Traffic noise, electronic noise, white noise to sleep -- just nerve jangling noise.Now, noise bothers me.  I crave silence.  We recently changed our television service -- we got rid of cable and went to an antenna, Roku, and Tivo.  It is wonderful.  I no longer have the urge to mindlessly flip through channels with the constant noise droning on and on. Darkness bothers me.  We have a very open floorplan house with many windows and I have to have those windows open.  Gone are the days of me wanting everything closed up tight with dim lighting and coziness all around.  I want it open.  And light.  And quiet.  I remember sleeping with the windows open and the curtains open.  I remember being able to hear my uncle, who was ill and lived across the street, coughing at night.  I remember being able to see the blinking red light on the tall building downtown where my father worked at night at the television station (yes, I could see it from my bedroom).  I remember things being open and not having to worry about having things locked up like a fortress.  I remember the screen door latch -- that was enough to keep intruders out.  First thing in the morning the door would come open and the screen latched and that is the way it stayed all day.  Clutter bothers me.  I wasn't always that way.  My mother and I would have words over the state of my dresser when I was a teenager.  I had to have everything I owned on top of that dresser within view. That wasn't quite her idea.  She would clean it off and I would junk it up.  One day we actually had an argument over it.  She won.  Now ....  I can't stand stuff on the furniture. I want it quiet, open, and light without anything sitting around. I am pretty much addicted to facebook.  It is not good for me.  I have always had a tendency to get \"down in the dumps\" -- not full-blown depressed (too busy for that) but moody.  I am finding myself to be that way more and more lately and I blame it on facebook.  So, recently, instead of just closing the computer only to come back a half hour later to see what is going on and who is on and who is saying what, I have started logging off because, basically, I am lazy and logging back on is just too much trouble.  Last night, however, I was looking critically at what I was actually paying attention to and there is no wonder I could be slightly moody.  The political posts, the prepper posts, the terrorist posts, the abused dog posts, the abused children posts, the critically ill children posts, the posts about all the dangers for the kids, the posts about how everything we eat and drink is killing us -- it is just too much.  I am getting too much of all of this stuff. It is so troubling and there isn't anything I can do about any of it. So, I decided to \"declutter\" my facebook account.  I deleted some people (sorry!).  I reduced contact with others.  Now the people that I will readily hear from are people that I actually know and have active communication with -- most of them are family.  I looked at the groups that I am a part of -- most of which I had no idea I was a part of.  I deleted almost all of them. One is particularly bothersome because the moderator is pretty much of a bully.  I deleted the game apps (except for Words with Friends that I play with my daughter).  I deleted all personal information although there wasn't much up there.  I breathed a sigh of relief and felt great accomplishment when I was done.  It is amazing how we get sucked into stuff like that and it is also amazing how we get into so many things on the internet without our knowledge.  It seems every time I do a search for something I am getting ads for that product or I am put on some sort of mail list.  I even get ads for things my husband searches for on HIS computer.  I don't especially like the feeling that everything is so incredibly \"out there\". I am not a particularly paranoid person but I don't doubt the existence of \"big brother\". I have also had to come to terms with my 'thing' with technology.  I love it but it doesn't love me.  I find it frustrating.  I have had each generation of Nook and each one is different with good points and bad points.  My most recent acquisition of the Samsung Galaxy Nook blah blah from last Christmas is annoying.  It overheats, it runs out of memory even with an SD card and I basically put it in the drawer because it was too much trouble to deal with.  I still have my Nook HD that I like to play a couple of games on but not on a regular basis.  I love my little Nook Glowlight because I don't have to charge it every chapter or so.  And, I love my little Asus netbook.  I have been reading real books because you don't have to worry about them running out of charge in the middle of a chapter.  How could something so simple trump something so innovative, timely, and sophisticated?Am I just getting old?  Is the world just moving too fast for me?  Am I slowing down?  Hopelessly out of touch?  I feel myself going backward in time -- I am creating my personal space -- the one I actually live in -- to be more like it was forty years ago.  I am not particularly happy in the here and now.  Now, don't get me wrong - I don't want to LEAVE the here and now -- I am having too much fun with my family and there are other aspects of my life where I feel energetic and young(er) and interested but there are too many things today that are too negative and too sinister -- has it always been that way and we didn't know about it?  Are we living on the information highway too much?So, the only way I know to deal with things is to limit my exposure to all the negativity -- less FB reading and more blog reading.  Less news coverage and more book reading.  Maybe that is putting myself in a bubble -- ostrich, head, sand sort of thing but I am afraid that is what I am going to have to do or my head is going to explode. I arose this morning before the sun.  I opened the curtain hoping to see some sort of wildlife.  There was none.   It is still after the windy \"cold front\" that moved through yesterday threatening the never-ending summer.  It isn't cold but a change in the air is detectable.  It is thoughtful sort of morning, misty memories floating through my consciousness.  Somehow, in an instant, I understand. When I was growing up I lived a different sort of life from my peers.  My father was \"famous\".  He was a local newscaster for the CBS affiliate station.  He expected us to adhere to certain standards.  We had to look the part.  I am not sure why, we were just plain people from south Texas.  So, from a young age I went to the beauty shop.  When I was about 12 I insisted that that little ritual stop when the beautician wouldn't quit doing my hair in Shirley Temple curls.  It was the 60's for goodness sake.  Our house was post-World War II tract housing but my mother furnished it in the latest trends.  I remember it well -- blond, limed oak furniture, a sophisticated tweed, one armed sofa, a black soapstone lamp that you could actually plant ivy in.  Somehow I never thought that was a good idea -- water, electricity - yeah, not a good idea.  I remember the kitchen -- blue and while tile counters (called drain boards, back then) and my mother had this lovely speckled linoleum (I purchased the same thing, twice, for various houses) and she painted the walls parchment beige and cabinets a lovely mocha shade.  A woman ahead of her time, clearly. In the mid 50's we lost the tweed sofa and tubby occasional chairs -- replaced with a t-seat sofa and matching chairs.  I loved that set and have, in fact, purchased something quite similar for my own home. Mother was a mover and a shaker -- didn't like to settle in on something for too long -- when a style changed, so did she.  I can sort of understand my father's dismay for this constant updating. At some point in the early 60's my mother decided we should move to a larger house -- one she knew well because it belonged to a friend.  We moved.  This necessitated a change in furniture.  Out went the lovely mid-century modern and t-seat suite and in came the Early American trend, so popular at that time.  Larger house meant larger furniture.  It was lovely but oh, my, what a pain to dust.  All those little turned legs and nooks and crannies.   She decorated and polished.  It looked like a department store. Around 1967 we made another move -- back to the original home which they still had.  Hmmm....smaller house (a tiny house by today's \"tiny house movement\" standard) and large furniture.  Large, heavy, dark furniture.  I missed the mid-century modern but it wasn't my call.  Mom still polished and hung colonial decorations asymetrically on the walls.  We lived in a harvest gold and avocado green world -- colors I never particularly liked but carried on into my own home due to popularity.In 1969 our version of the tiny house burned down.  We were in it.  We got out.  Everybody was ok -- even the dog.  However, something happpened to my mother.  Not physically.  Emotionally the desire to be house proud left her in an instant. We moved back into the house after the rebuiltd  It looked the same -- sort of -- but it was missing some of the charming things that made it nice in spite of its' tiny footprint.  The faceted glass doorknobs were gone as were the lovely paneled doors -- replaced with brass hardware and slab doors.  Not the same.  The tile in the kitchen with the site-built cabinets were gone and replaced with stock, ready to hang, cabinets and formica.  Ok, no grout to bleach on a regular basis but---- there was no grout to bleach -- the routine was broken.As was my mother.  From that point on, my mother didn't hang on to anything material.  There was minimal decoration, things that were lost from the fire weren't replaced, There was nothing sitting around, no knick-knacks, no plants, nothing.  She didn't care.  I didn't get it.  Home was different.  My mother was different.  What had happened to my life?Yesterday, I got it.  I believe my mother had reached the time in her life that I have reached now although she was considerably younger at the time.  It is the realization that material things just don't make you happy.  Material things are clutter.  Material things are things to be dusted, and cleaned and moved around and shifted and clearly things to multiply in the night.  I have heard other people say, after fires and other natural disasters, that material goods just didn't have the same impact on them as they used to.  Some people, in fact, look at it as a blessing.  I wouldn't wish any sort of a natural disaster on anybody anywhere under any circumstances but there is something about starting over that is cathartic.Yesterday I walked through my house and I looked at it, critically, from the front door and tried to see what others see when they walk in.  It is crowded.  There is too much stuff.  It grates on my nerves. It makes me tired.  I think that is where my mother's head was -- she was just tired.  Granted, she was only 46 years old at that time but she was tired.  I am tired.  I don't wish to spend my time dusting spindly little legs on furniture.  I don't wish to spend my money on decorations that need to be stored or dusted or washed (thank you Hobby Lobby for all the lovely seasonal decorations that I won't be buying).  I understand where my mother's head was when she would clean the house (always smelled like Pine-sol and lemon oil) and then just want to sit down with a book. I get it.  It has taken me longer than her but -- I get it."},
{"title": "Boy, Was I Wrong!", "date": "Thursday, October 01, 2015", "text": "I thought that my elder years would be spent lolling around, eating bon-bons, watching game shows on tv and generally vegetating.  Well, I guess I was wrong.  First off, I don't feel like an \"elder\" person -- I still listen to rock and roll music for goodness sakes!  I am pretty up on pop culture (much to my husband's dismay) and I still like fashion and makeup an such -- oh, and bon-bons, too!However, what isn't happening is the lolling around.  I am as busy now as I ever have been and for that I am thankful.  I don't think I would \"loll\" very well.  I am learning new things (crochet) and I am cooking from scratch -- all.the.time.  I am also sewing-- a lot.So, while I have been away from here for several days, I haven't been sitting still.  I have been sewing.  I am making a quilt from these fabrics --It is a very simple quilt with the \"map\" as the center and then borders of the other two.  I am handquilting it, without a hoop or frame, and I have pinned it with over 800 safety pins spaced 2\" apart.  I didn't think that quilting without a hoop would be possible -- or at least enjoyable -- but it is.  I haven't had any hand pain at all and that has made it a very enjoyable project.Also, coming up at the end of October is Bean's school's answer to Halloween.  It is called \"Saints and Angels\" Day.  For pre-k 3 and 4 she was an angel.  This year she gets to be a saint.  She also got to choose her saint and she chose the obvious -- St. Elizabeth Ann Seton -- her school's namesake.  St. Elizabeth Ann Seton appeals to my daughter's interest as she is an American saint, born during the American Revolution era and was originally Episcopalian. So, St. Elizabeth Ann Seton we will be.So, I am adapting this pattern -- and doing it by hand, I might add because I have discovered that sewing clothing by hand (couture) allows me to sit in front of the television as I stitch and not in the back bedroom by myself.I am using the blue dress pattern with the cap from the upper left view and I am lengthening the pilgrim collar to be a cape.And then, the Bean needs some fall dresses for church.  I am making this one up out of something -- not sure what.  I made a muslin (first time ever) for fit and surprisingly, it fit! So, on I will go.So, that is what I have been doing while I am waiting for more medical tests -- I am still waiting for an appointment (they will call -- SOMETIME) and trying to maintain some form of sanity.And cooking -- I am enjoying cooking, for some odd reason, even though my husband doesn't seem to enjoy my cooking -- unless it is bread. On a somewhat sad, yet humorous note, I have been forced to recognize that I am not a spring chicken anymore which probably means that I should cut my hair because old hens don't wear long hair -- right?  Anyway, I had to attend a funeral yesterday.  I have lost about 1 1/2 inch in height which means my slacks are too long.  I decided to wear some heels of the lower, kitten style.  Bad, bad bad decision.  I have arthritis in my feet and haven't worn heels in years -- YEARS -- I could hardly walk.  My toes hurt me so much last night I thought I was going to cry -- I seem to have arthritis in the joints where my tiny little delicate toes attach to my feet.  I figured I would be fine this morning.  Again -- WRONG! I can hardly walk -- my right foot hurts so much!  I think I will be doing a bit of decluttering with all my heels!  That way I can make room for my new orthopedic shoes which I will probably need after this.Lesson learned.  Oh well at least I get to go shoe shopping! That is always fun.So, anyway, that is what I have been doing.  I will post quilt pics when I get a little farther along.Have a great day!"},

{"title": "Pidge", "date": "Monday, August 31, 2015", "text": "When I was growing up I lived across the street from my cousin, JLSHall.  We lived in what was the boom of post-war housing.  We lived in small houses that now fit into the \"tiny house\" spectrum, all being in the 950-1100 sq. ft. range.The houses in the photo above are not of my street but it could be.  The house on the far right looks amazingly like the house I grew up in -- white asbestos shingles, royal blue shutters, the same sort of small front porch but the roof was dark blue.  It sort of makes me homesick to look at this photo. My aunt's house was across the street and the color scheme was green.  These houses were built with returning soldiers in mind and with the idea that there would be huge booms in the economy and retail and manufacturing and there was.  These houses were full of families -- kids in almost each and every one.  However, I assume the builders knew that the houses would be too small for very large families so they placed them on very large lots with room to expand.We didn't expand and neither did my aunt and uncle.  My uncle however did build a rather large pigeon coop toward the back of the lot up against a patio that he put in the middle of the yard.  He had lots of pigeons and JLSHall and I loved to play in that coop much to our mother's dismay -- it wasn't all that tidy!  My uncle cleaned it out regularly but not as regularly as the pigeons messed it up.It was great fun to be in that yard at dusk when he would whistle and the pigeons, with their little colored bands on their legs, would line up on the telephone wires and wait. He would fill the feed, open the door and they would all go home to roost for the night.  I loved playing with the bands.  They were very colorful and fun to sort.So, when I saw Pidge for the first time that is what I thought of -- those fun evenings watching Uncle Frank's pigeons.  So now, every morning I am on the lookout for Pidge -- and he is usually there.I don't know much about pidgeons but my husband says it is odd that he is alone, they usually travel in pairs.  I don't know where his partner is, or his flock but I do know that I really enjoy looking out the door first thing and seeing him pecking around on the patio or sitting on the fence.  He makes me smile."},
{"title": "Old Fashioned Living", "date": "Friday, August 28, 2015", "text": "I know I am getting old.  Maybe that old adage \"you can't teach an old dog new tricks\" is really  true.  I always thought I was on the cutting edge but now I am not so sure. I have been reading blogs written by women who enjoy living in a different era.  Some do it to the extreme and on purpose, others just don't see any reason to change the way they do things -- \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" sort of mindset.I have sort of been drifting backward to the days of my youth. Now, don't get me wrong, I have no intention of giving up my electric lights, my indoor plumbing, my television, dishwasher, computer, etc.  However, there are some things that we have/do today that I think are detrimental to our health and planet and those things are things I would like to find an alternative for.I had just about gone \"paper-free\" in the kitchen although I will never train my family to use cloth napkins rather than paper.  However, after a recent eye infection and the yuck factor that comes from that, I went back to paper in the kitchen and the bathrooms. However, with that said, my sensibilities are sending me right back to regular towels -- I just can't stand the waste of the paper.Another thing that has gotten my attention lately is plastic -- again.  My house is almost plastic free but I do still buy plastic food bags of the zip lock variety.  I made a bunch of cookies last week and stored some in a Hefty zipper bag.  The next morning I opened the bag and was met with a horrible, toxic plastic smell.  Out went the cookies and off I went to buy some glass jars to store leftovers and such in.  Last night I was thinking about it and checked the brand and decided that I won't buy Hefty anymore but will continue to buy Ziploc brand.  I have never had any problem with Ziploc products but I am going to move toward glass as often as I can.I was thinking about all the plastic in our homes as I was wrangling a bunch of coat hangers -- wire and plastic alike.  Then, my eyes landed on a coat hanger that I have had in my closet forever.  It was \"made\" by my cousin's grandmother who was like another grandmother to me.  She lived with my cousin, aunt and uncle and they lived right across the street from me so she was a grandmotherly figure to me as well.  She used to sit and cover these coat hangers with strips from old sheeting.  She would make them by the dozens.  Everybody in the family wanted some.  She would cut worn out sheets into long strips and then use a larks head knot to cover the entire hanger.  You can tell they are old because the hanger is much heavier than metal hangers today and the sheeting hasn't fallen apart and these are at least 60 years old.  I wish I had more because they are a wonderful alternative to the plastic ones in the closet now.  I might have to try my hand at it.Another thing that has been changed around here are the plastic cups I schlep to school for Bean to have a drink after school in the car.  I have a couple of thesebut have become increasingly concerned about them.  I know they are BPA free but the straw mechanism is complicated and I forget to get them out of the car and I am never sure that I get them clean enough and I don't like the idea of leaving them in a hot car, BPA or no.  So, I have made a change from these to theseYes, Bean will be drinking from a humble mason jar with a BPA free lid adapter and a straw -- straight forward and easy to clean.And, last but not least, we have a new creature in the back garden.  It is the biggest pigeon I have ever seen.  He lets the sparrows throw the seed out of the feeder (out of sight here) and then he forages food from the patio.  He is huge. He is really gorgeous.  Love having him around,These are the earth shattering, life changing things that have been on my mind this week.  Now I guess I will get back to the laundry and sweeping and I am going to try a rice pudding recipe I received yesterday (thank you Mary).  I will let you know how it turns out!"},
{"title": "In the Blink of an Eye", "date": "Wednesday, August 26, 2015", "text": "It was Monday.  Hubs and I decided to spend the day doing fun things.  We went to Northeast Mall, to Sears, to buy a line splitter (I have no clue, don't ask).  We went to Cabela's to buy fitover sunglasses (they are lovely).  We went to lunch at Chaps (best burgers in the world).  We went by my daughter's house to get a pick-up sign for my granddaughter's express line pickup.  We were too early so we went for a little ride.  It was a lovely, relaxed day.And then it wasn't.We were driving south on US 377 and had just gone through the Kroger intersection.  We were in the far left hand lane next to the turn lane.  We saw the car turn, we heard the explosive impact, we never saw the motorcycle.  On impact there were vehicle parts flying into the air.  The motorcycle was completely decimated.  The car's front end was gone, the driver had lost control and was up on the curb then back on the street and finally came to a stop.  As we passed by we could see him -- the motorcycle rider.  He was on the pavement.  He was young, not very big, lots of dark hair and, on quick review, very broken -- he was gone.Hubs tried to stop but the traffic was bad and we couldn't.  I grabbed my phone and called the police.  As we turned the corner to go to Bean's school we saw the police officers who usually monitor the traffic through there (5 schools in close proximity) turn on their sirens and head that way.  As we waited for Bean we saw the Careflight helicopters overhead -- two of them.  Neither for the motorcycle rider. There were four people in the car -- all adults.  Two were ok and two were taken, by air, to local hospitals in critical condition -- one went immediately into surgery from all accounts.  The last report I heard was that they were all expected to be ok.  My daughter's neighbor, a fire fighter that was on one of the helicopters, told her the people in the car would be fine but that it was a really awful accident.They finally released the name of the young man.  I searched for a facebook page for him and found it.  There he was with his blue motorcycle -- a crotch rocket as they are called.  He was very proud of it.  It looked to be brand new.  Some of the comments were disturbing -- they made mention of his reckless driving.  There were comments from his mother about how dangerous and scary it was.  There were comments from a girl that I assumed was his girlfriend. I went to her page.  The pain was palpable.   Today she has posted photos of a makeshift memorial at the site with her laying on the place that his body last rested. There were calls to the Keller police department last weekend reporting a blue motorcycle driving very fast and popping wheelies on this same road.  They have no way of telling if it was the same driver.  However, this young man's rate of speed as he made impact with the car was at least, if not greater than, 100 mph.  It was 2:30 in the afternoon on a busy street -- the first day of school with lots of buses and parents on their way to pick up children.  It is sobering to think that, had he swerved another way or weaved between two different cars, it could have been us as we were that close.  As the debris rained down from that clear, blue sky we could hear it hit the ground -- we were close enough to check our car to see if anything had hit it.  Physically we, and all those around us, were fine but the emotional impact is unexplainable.   I visited the DFW Scanner Facebook page and joined in the convo there and everybody who witnessed this tragedy were shaken and expressing a good deal of distress over watching it.  Myself included.  My husband was shaken to the point that he went very quiet and was visibly upset.  So, this morning as I read comments from his mother and see his girlfriend's attempts to understand, I have to admit, I don't understand.  Looking at this young man's photo -- he is just a baby -- born the year my son graduated high school.  He had his whole life ahead and jeopardized it for a thrill.In the blink of an eye how so many lives were changed.  It is life changing to witness a person die -- it was quick -- it was irreversible.  The people in the car might be ok physically but what about emotionally.  They will always question whether they could have changed something even though they probably never saw the motorcycle bearing down on their car.  The witnesses who watched helplessly as this young man left this earth, a broken child -- somebody's child, somebody's special person -- and we wonder why.Monday started out a really good day.And then, it wasn't."},

They usually take a first day photo in front of the school but today it was taken at her place in her classroom.  She was very excited that she was placed in the room she wanted and was very happy that there is a large selection of books in the reading area of the room.  Oh yes, I guess I should add that during the summer, she became a Reading Bean as well! We had all been working with her on her reading but over the summer she just took off and can read whole books all by herself! Her mother is looking forward to a very good year!"},

{"title": "Rule of Life -- Disclaimer -- Religous Heavy", "date": "Friday, August 07, 2015", "text": "For the past few years I have been a member of a religious order known as the Daughters of the King.  I am no longer a member of that order by choice.  Our diocese has gone through a huge change by leaving the American Episcopal Church.  Our diocese was involved in a lengthy and ugly battle for our property.  Our diocese was in litigation for over five years but we did come out the other side with our property and so we begin again.  We are no longer called \"Episcopal\" as in aligning ourselves with the national Episcopal church but we are now Anglican and aligned with the larger Anglican Communion and the ACNA.  The daughters who were involved with the DOK have now been offered an alternative that they could take although not required.  Some of the daughters have chosen to stay with DOK but I have not.  I am moving forward with the discernment period for the Daughters of the Holy Cross.   Not being a cradle Episcopalian all of this didn't affect me quite like it did others although I didn't relish the thought of arriving for church of a Sunday morning and finding myself locked out and on the curb.  I do care deeply for my church and the people an clergy therein and I don't like the idea of having to seek out a new place so I am moving forward in this new reality. The emphasis in DHC is a bit different than DOK.  DOK is all prayer all the time which is what drew me in because I figure as a common person I can't do a lot but I can pray and believe in the practice wholeheartedly.  DHC focuses on prayer as well but equally weighted are evangelism, study and service and that is to be our rule of life.  I am on board with all that but I have to say that study is my hardest -- getting into the Word is so overwhelming to me.  I need to work on that.It was suggested in DOK that we keep a prayer journal and there was even a meeting to show us how to make one.  For some of our avid scrapbookers it was an opportunity to be very creative.  I didn't go to the meeting and I never made the prayer journal -- popcorn prayers seems to be my go-to method for prayers. It was also suggested that we keep a prayer journal for DHC and I have taken that to heart and realize that I could benefit from being a little more organized in my approach to things.  After getting started I also realize that this isn't something that can be \"done\" like a scrap book.  It is an evolving thing.  It is almost a living thing.  So, when I first started building this I realized that it isn't an activity that I can sit down to and be done - it is ongoing and I needed to just relax and realize that.  Also, I see that it has the potential to become more of a Rule of Life journal rather than just a prayer journal  as we work our way through this discernment period.So, anyway, this is my journal.  It is very plain and very humble but I hope that it helps me focus on this part of my life a little better.I took a plain 7X9 sturdy plastic binder and outfitted it with two sets of plain dividers and appropriate paper. Although not a scrapbooker  I found some faith-affirming stickers to add to the dividers to keep me inspired.I labled each divider with things that I thought I would like to include in this journal.  I will probably change that around as I go because I was very specific but who knows, I might become even more specific.  We will see how it and I grow.This is a cute little prayer prompt that I put in the section labelled \"prayer prompts\".  I used Bean's hand for this and showed her what I was doing.  She wanted to know which finger was for her!  I think that my prayers, except for the morning and bedtime prayers, are going to be written.  I think my mind won't wander so much.  A lady I know writes her prayers in a letter to God and I think that sounds so personal and real.  Also, I did find a site on Pinterest where the author gives you a daily prayer prompt to write about and I think I am going to start there.I added a section for the Rosary -- I started with the Anglican Rosary, drew it out and added some prayers on sheets behind it.  I have always just used this rosary with my own choice of prayers, mostly the Jesus prayer, so I did a google search and found some really nice prayers to use here -- my favorite is the Celtic prayer.I will also add the same for the Roman rosary as that is what we use at church.  It will require more drawing and more writing but I did load a Rosary prayer app to my tablet which will be helpful.  I have a section for Scripture Study that I plan to use  as I work on getting into the Word.  Not my strong suit here so I decided to make the pages a little fancier -- maybe a bit inspiring.    As I said earlier, study is overwhelming to me -- I question why I haven't read the Bible cover to cover, I question how I would even do that, I have tried starting with the Old Testament but I have to say that, as much as I love genealogy, I always get hung up on that part.  However, I was always taught that to understand the New Testament you have to have read the Old Testament so that is where I always start. So, trying hard to move away from the idea that you have to read the Bible front to back in order, I was intrigued by the mention in an earlier discernment of lectio divina --This made sense to me -- don't try to read the whole thing at once, do this and it will be a joy rather than something to be endured.  Baby steps.  I can do that.The tools that I am going to use, other than my journal, are these --A good study Bible that I can write in -- I have one but it isn't easy to read so I am going to have to work on that.The 1979 Book of Common Prayer. A One Year Bible for Women -- this is a Bible that is divided up differently -- each day you get a passage from the Old Testament, the New Testament and Psalms.  I think that would be beneficial to me as I approach this new endeavor.Another thing that makes this group different from DOK is that there is the expectation of service -- a service project.  I think that will be good for all of us -- it sort of completes the circle in my mind.  We haven't touched on that yet, it is for the upcoming weeks but I am looking forward to what my fellow Daughters have to offer.So, that is what I have been up to.  Don't worry, dear Readers, I am not turning this blog into a diary of my spiritual journey.Here are a few photos of the progress in the front of the house.  I didn't take \"before\" photos so just picture a dozen or so hawthorn bushes that were not doing particularly well.  I believe we have had so many plant problems because this house was built on rock -- yes, rock -- and topsoil was brought in for landscaping purposes but it isn't all that deep and I think it just can't sustain all the big bushes and such that people have put in.  So, anyway, here is the front --right side of the gate -- bushes goneit is a long little stretch of bedthe planting has commencedyes, he is measuring with a stick -- I don't know who that strange man in the baggy clothes isstill more to comeI will post a picture of the finished product when it is a finished product."},

{"title": "The Winter People by Jennifer McMahon", "date": "Friday, July 24, 2015", "text": "For my final book in my 2015 Goodreads Reading challenge I read \"The Winter People\" by Jennifer McMahon.  This is not my usual genre but I have to say I enjoyed it.  I am not sure how to classify this book -- a mystery or horror -- but it was a bit of both and a lot of murder.  It was also historical fiction involving multiple generations.  So, you can see it was a bit complicated.It was the story of Sara, Martin, Gertie and Auntie.  They lived in the 19th century Vermont.  They were the subjects of a book -- \"Visitors from the Other Side\" writtenby Sara's niece, Amelia Larkin. My beloved aunt, Sara Harrison Shea, was brutally murdered in the winter of 1908.  She was thirty-one years old.\"Visitors from the Other Side\" was the secret diary of Sara Harrison Shea that detailed her life with her parents, Auntie and her coming to learn about sleepers. The first time I saw a sleeper, I was nine years old.  It was the spring before Papa sent Auntie away--before we lost my brother, Jacob. My sister, Constance, had married the fall before and moved to Graniteville.This story of Sara, Martin, Gertie and Auntie was the foundation for the whole book. Present time -- Ruthie, Fawn, and AliceRuthie, Fawn and their mother Alice live in the Harrison-Shea house with all it's secret places and hidey holes. The house backs up to the woods and Devil's Hand.  The girl's were taught to never go into the woods -- bad things happen to little girls who go into the woods.  People disappear.  Alice disappears.  Will  they find her?  What did she know?  What did she do?Present time -- CandaceShe knew the whole story but wanted to find the missing diary pages for financial gain.  Did she find them?  Did she profit or did she get something else?Present time -- Katherine, Gary and AustinAll Gary wanted was for Austin to come back.  Could the diary help him get Austin back or would it prove to leave Katherine alone?  Would the diary take Katherine in a direction from which there was no turning back?As you can see there is a very twisting, intertwined plot.  Each story stands on its own yet the entire story feeds on the interconnection.  This book is well written, the twists and turns are plausible and don't seem to be contrived.  It is a good mystery, enough horror to make it just scary enough and there is a bit of cliff hanger.  Would I recommend this book?  Yes.  It isn't my usual sort of read but it was good and drew me in.  I did find myself worrying about Fawn and her fever though -- she really didn't need to be out running around in the snow at night with a bad fever and I wish they would have just left her home.  I guess that was just a \"mommy moment\"."},
{"title": "Book Reviews", "date": "Tuesday, July 21, 2015", "text": "Summer is flying by, it seems.  I have a \"to-do\" list that I am working on but it is a slow go.  I haven't been reading as much either because most of my reading was done on my commute to my daughter's house and now, since I am at home, other demands have taken over. I have, however, read three books that I haven't reviewed yet.  They are all part of my reading queue so no real surprises here but they were enjoyable.I have to say that I was not thrilled with this Agatha Raisin book.  I don't know why, perhaps the location or perhaps the repetition -- lots of driving all over the place.  However, I didn't dislike it enough to give up on the series and will be continuing with the next in the queue as soon as I finish my current book.I enjoyed this book by Jennifer Chiaverini -- the next in my line of  the Elm Creek Quilts series.  Perhaps I should have read it closer to Christmas but it was a nice spring/summer read too.  I love the way Chiaverini uses the setting of Elm Creek Manor for all her books whether they are current or historical -- the manor is the main character in the book, actually.  It is interesting to see how she weaves the history of the place in all the books regardless of the time period.This book was a bit different than her others as it gives a back history of some of the Elm Creek quilters -- new characters to the books and it shows their lives prior to their involvement in the Manor and how they came to the Manor.  It centers around one day -- an interview day for prospective employees and it goes into their tales of how they got to that interview and what happens after.  It is very cleverly written and I enjoyed seeing it unfold.I would recommend any of these books -- just because I didn't enjoy the Agatha Raisin book doesn't mean you won't.  I am looking forward to the next one after my current read.My current read is \"The Winter People\" by Jennifer McMahon.  It is a diversion from my usual style of reading -- it is a ghost story with a mystery involved.  I am enjoying it although I have to say it is disturbing.  I am half done with it and am getting to the point that I can't put it down but I don't know if I will gravitate toward this particular genre again any time soon.  It isn't frightening, just disturbing but I am sure there will be some clever twists as I go along.  I will review when I am done.So, there you go.  That is where my reading obsession has taken me the last couple of months.  I went to the library for myself for the first time in forever and I have to say I enjoyed it. They were holding my current read for me so I went to pick it up and I, for a moment, felt that same feeling I used to have as a child in the library with a much sought after book.  Different library and I am much older but the thrill was still there.  I am going to have to make a point of going to the library more often but first I am going to have to read down my own library a bit and that is where my next couple of books will be coming from."},

{"title": "Marriage -- Another Viewpoint", "date": "Friday, July 03, 2015", "text": "Disclaimer -- this is NOT a post about the SCOTUS decision to allow gay marriage in all 50 of the United States.  I am religiously driven not politically driven so I will not be discussing that here.  This is about something else.Anybody who has read my blog realizes that I am a family history hound.  My research comes and goes in spurts as my interest, time, and available information ebbs and flows.  Right now it is flowing.  One particularly late night last week I had been chasing down some information I hadn't noticed before -- maybe it was something new posted on Ancestry.com or maybe I just hadn't looked closely but there it was.The Mayflower.  The Mayflower connection I guess that every family historian is curious about and hopes for.  This came from other people's research and I would, of course, have to do my own before I totally lay claim to it but it looks promising.This leads me to the problem.This particular branch of my family is the most difficult to prove and, to date, it is the most interesting.  Why is it so hard to prove?  Well, proof requires documentation.  Documentation can be in the form of birth certificates, death certificates, census records, land records, etc.  As you go farther back in the search  these pieces of documentation aren't as forthcoming as you might imagine.  Early census records didn't list each member of the family but rather the head of family and then a counting of the people in the family by gender and age.  So, what does one do when you get farther back?  Family Bibles are always great sources if you are lucky enough to have one.  Published genealogies are generally accepted as proof of lineage with dealing with membership into heritage based groups and societies such as the DAR, The Mayflower Society, DRT, etc.So, what is the problem you might ask.  My grandmother.  My poor grandmother.  I loved her dearly, still do and now I am very upset over her lack of \"paper trail\".    I can prove that she was married to my grandfather.  I can prove she had four children, five granddaughters, lived in the same house for close to a  century, I can even find her on the census records.  However, what I can't prove is that she was ever born.  She has no birth certificate as she was born before they were required here in Texas and, even though they became mandatory in 1903, many home births were never recorded anywhere and there were a LOT of home births in the early 1900's.  And, there is no marriage license for her parents.  Don't be shocked. I am not.  And there is not to say there wasn't one, I just can't find it.  Yes, the census records prove that she was born but it doesn't prove parentage and that is the hitch in my giddy-up.So, early in my quest for Mayflower recognition, I am stopped.  I can prove everything past this point but am stymied early on in the quest.  I am sad first and foremost for my grandmother -- she has no paper trail as a child -- and secondly for me and my daughter and my cousins who would be eligible to flaunt this rich heritage but for the want of a piece of paper.So, for all my 60's free-loving friends, for all my friends who feel that marriage is too confining, to all my friends who feel that marriage is redundant, to all my friends who ask what importance there is in a piece of paper --- friends -- IT IS IMPORTANT!!!!For anybody planning to have children under any circumstances -- GET MARRIED!  THE PIECE OF PAPER ISN'T JUST PAPER!!!!Whether it is a civil union, a religious ceremony, a consentual agreement -- just get the piece of paper.  And keep it.  Put it someplace safe.  Make copies and pass them around the family.  Whatever.  Your grandchildren, great-grandchildren and even your 11th great-granddaughter would really appreciate it.I am done here."},
{"title": "Here Comes the Bride - la la la la", "date": "Wednesday, July 01, 2015", "text": "Today is our wedding anniversary.  It is our 43rd anniversary.  We were married in Concordia Lutheran Church in San Antonio, Texas at 2:00 pm. The reception was held in the fellowship hall.  As I said on my facebook post this morning -- after 43 years the only advice I can give to young people is don't get married on the 4th of July weekend and don't wear a long sleeved dress in Texas if you feel the a/c in the church is going to give out.  Other than that -- you just have to work it out.  Here are some photos from the auspicious occasion.You have probably seen these pics before because they are on the computer and I guess I am just too lazy to go scan in others.  They have all turned a nasty orange-y hue but I will tell you that my bridesmaides dresses were a very lovely pale peach color with white flowers.  My grandmother, who made a couple of the dresses, decided to cut out some of the flowers and attach them on top of the dress with pearls.  It was lovely.  They also wore bows in their hair, which I am sure my matron of honor was very fond of, and white gloves.  Remember white gloves?  You can see my matron of honor right next to me in the last photo -- she would be my cousin JSLHall. I look exactly the same today except there is more of me and my hair is quite white in the front, darker in the back and hangs to about three inches below my shoulder.  Otherwise, no difference.  I jest, of course.We celebrated the day last night as I have a meeting at church tonight.  We went to a lovely local restaurant called The Tavern.Allen had rib eye steak with tomatoes with blue cheese.  I had rotisserie chicken with pecan and wild rice salad.  We had Tres Leche cake for dessert -- one serving shared between us. I should have taken photos -- I had the camera but I just don't think about photographing my food.  I should think about that.Anyway, it was a delightful evening.Earlier in the day we had company in the form of Dear Daughter and the Bean.  Allen was out working in the yard so Bean thought it would be a good time for a swim.  Makes it sound like I have some sort of outdoor oasis, doesn't it?  Well, here she is lounging away --It was quite lovely out and I enjoyed sitting out in the nice breeze.  Until later, of course, when the allergies hit complete with chest congestion and swollen eyes.  I am just so pathetic when it comes to allergies. Anyway, it was a lovely day!"},
{"title": "Walking this Messy Earth by Catherine Valentine", "date": "Monday, June 29, 2015", "text": "It was the 7th grade when I met Nellie.  We were both new to our junior high school and probably both feeling like little fish in a big pond.  She stood out in the crowd right away because of her beautiful copper penny hair.  We became friends -- not best friends but friends.  She was a very genuinely nice little girl.  Now, I was an only child and very sheltered.  Two of my greatest fears in life were losing my mother and fire.  In 1963, in that 7th grade year, the thing happened that was the culmination of all my fears -- but it didn't happen to me -- it happened to Nellie.  There was a fire and she lost her mother.  I couldn't bear the horror of it but one thing stood out to me -- Nellie's grace with which she bore the burden.  Over the years, through high school, I observed Nellie and how she grew and how confident she became and my mantra was \"what would Nellie do\" and if I was dealing with something that I deemed particularly difficult I would remind myself that \"if Nellie could cope with THAT I can certainly cope with THIS because Nellie went through the worst thing possible\".  I have looked at life through Nellie's eyes most of my life.Nellie and I lost touch over the years until MySpace came into being and I was looking for childhood friends and I found her.  We reconnected there and again on Facebook.  One day I decided it was time to write Nellie a letter and tell her what a profound impact she had on my life. I am glad I did because I would have been forever regretful if I hadn't.  We lost Nellie a little over a year ago and I am still asking myself, during rough days, \"what would Nellie do\".Nellie left a beautiful legacy in that of her children, one of which is Catherine Valentine, a young, aspiring writer.  Catherine has written three books -- a children's book \"The Waterlady: An Ozark Tale\", and two books of poetry \"Mothers and Daughters\" and the one I am reviewing today, \"Walking this Messy Earth\".\"Walking this Messy Earth\" is a small volume of twenty poems, each one exploring, explaining and/or relishing in the ups and downs of her journey toward God and Christ.  There are moments of despair and joy, self-effacing exploration of doubts and fears, questions of faith and \"am I doing it right\".  Some of the writings are more child--like and some are more raw and questioning.  All of them are thought provoking and, in my opinion, cover the whole range of emotions of those of faith who are on the same journey -- Catherine just isn't afraid to voice her thoughts which is probably a God-given way for her to learn and make her way.  Questioning and learning is never a bad thing.One of my favorite poems in the collection is \"Christmas\".  The first stanza is so indicative of Christmas as we see it --\"A picturesque scene--the manger and lowly lambChristmas and good cheer,soft lights and presents.Forgetting the sadnessand the wounds--a little baby raised to die\"Most time Christmas is just as she describes it -- no thought that with Christmas comes Easter -- no thought to the circle of His life.  This poem certainly brings it all into perspective.Another offering in the collection -- \"Prayers\" -- which deals with how to pray -- the right way to pray.  How many people don't pray because they don't feel that they know the \"proper\" way to pray? \"He hears all -- just speak\"Another that I particularly liked is \"Old Faith\".  Maybe it is because I am older but as I read this poem I could just hear the tune to \"Little Brown Church in the Vale\" one of my favorite hymns growing up in my neighborhood Methodist church.   As I read it memories of my time in that church came flooding back and it was good.  Old faith -- so simple.The poem that stands out to me the most, that touches me the most is \"Heart's Want\".  It is about her mother.  It is about her acceptance of her mother's passing and realizing that her mother has made the journey and is now in the hands of the Lord.  It is quiet and sad but hopeful and joyous at the same time. Poetry is very subjective and I believe that everybody gleans from it what they are supposed to -- what is right for them at the time -- and not necessarily what was in the author's head at the time of writing.  To me, poetry invokes mental pictures even more than prose and Catherine's work created some powerful images in my mind. Clearly this is a collection of faith driven words and thoughts drawn from personal experience.  It is Catherine's journey to this point in her life.  It is uniquely hers yet so undeniably universal -- I feel that anybody who is on a spiritual journey can identify with almost everything in this book.  Because of that I find it to be comforting in that the reader is not alone in his/her thoughts -- a camaraderie of sorts -- journeying hand in hand, so to speak, walking this messy earth.I did not ask permission to use excerpts from the book but since Catherine asked me to review I assumed it was ok.  Hopefully I won't be in trouble for that.If you are interested in learning more about Catherine or obtaining a copy of any of her books please visit her at  http://catherinevalentine.wix.com/cvalentinewriter#!blog/cm7y.In closing I have to add that it is a privilege to know Catherine, to be included in her circle of friends and to have the opportunity to read and review her work.  I am certain that Nellie is so proud of her daughter as am I.

My mother came to pick me up and we made a quick run to the grocery store -- the store that Hubs worked at.  I was clearly not a happy camper and the assistant manager kept hanging around the check stand and he asked what was wrong, my mother explained and he said \"if I let Allen off work early would you go to the movie with him?\"  My mother answered that we would have to ask my dad and he should call in a little while.  Clearly Allen and I had gone completely mute as this exchange between the asst. manager and my mother was going on.   Long story short -- we came home with milk, Cokes, fritos and a date. I was just a tad mortified by the whole thing and I am sure Allen was quite anxiety ridden as he was on restriction for ignoring curfew and he had to borrow the car.  I got over it and he somehow managed to get off restriction and get the car so.... We went here --to see and  and then we sat on the porch and talked until about midnight.    My mother asked if I thought I would go out with him again and I looked her straight in the face and said \"Mom, I am probably going to marry him\".  Seven years later I did just that.So, when was this life-changing momentous occasion?  June 26, 1965.  Fifty years ago today.  Did you hear that?  FIFTY YEARS AGO!!!!  How could that be? If you are wondering what happened to the other major players in that little scenario well --The other young man came back a few months later and wanted \"to be friends\".  I said no.  Regrets?  Yes. We had been friends first and then tried dating.  It didn't work for us but we shouldn't have let go of the friendship.  He ended up marrying a girl I went to high school with -- his second marriage and he has two children.The assistant manager whose name was Doug was our best man.  We lost touch quite some time ago which is a shame -- he was a nice guy.My mother passed on in 1996. Fifty years ago -- wow."},

{"title": "I Am Not Going to Lie", "date": "Friday, June 05, 2015", "text": "I am tired.  It was a somewhat emotional day for me for all sorts of silly reasons.  As most everybody knows, my husband and I babysit Bean on the days she is not in school -- three days last year and two this year.  On the days she was in school we picked her up.  Her last day for Pre-K 4 was last Friday but my daughter was still in school all this week so we had Bean all week.  I am not used to having her all day for five days and I knew I would be tired but I really enjoyed it knowing that next year she will be in school five days a week.  We will be picking her up from school but that is so little time together after having had the privilege of having these two years with her.  It hit me at lunch today -- this would be the last lunch I would be making for her -- the last lunch we would be sharing -- the last intense conversation over lunch.  Oh, I know there will be the odd days I will have her, when she is sick or there are school holidays that don't coincide with her mother's days off but it won't be the same.  Oh, the sadness hit like a ton of bricks.  I now have to adjust to my new reality.  I am sure I will be fine but I will miss her and her antics, the long talks, the reading lessons, surgery on the stuffed animals -- all those things.  She is growing up too fast for me.After I get done with my pity party I have to play catch up.  I have an email to answer (Bonnie!) and a snail mail letter to answer (Mary!).  I am thankful these two friends are patient because I wanted to wait until I could give these correspondences proper attention -- I don't like to try to answer important letters in a rushed manner and these letters are important.  So, that will be the first on my list of things to do starting tomorrow morning.Next thing is helping Hubs do a little yard work.  We still haven't replaced the tree that fell down and after looking at the whole of the area, we have decided a complete re-do is in order.  Neither one of us is \"into\" yard work so we are going to make things easier.  Actually, when we had the landscaping done in the back garden it was in an effort to make things easier but the reality of it is, it just became an over abundance of work that neither one of us wants to undertake.  It has become bigger than the two of us together.There is some sewing to be done and definitely some de-cluttering.  I have done a lot of reading about minimalism and living with what we really need -- not everything we have collected and I am sure this summer will mean a good look at everything that is stuffed in obscure drawers and closet corners.  Some of that will be started tomorrow as well.I have plans to do some stitching -- hopefully finishing something and then there is the ever ongoing effort to read through my personal library.  I have enough unread books to keep me busy for years -- absolutely years.  So what do I do?  I go to the library.  I have no more room for books so I was thinking an e-reader would be a great idea and it is but I am finding the books to be a little more expensive than I would like to pay.  I do frequent Half Price Books which is great on price but still doesn't solve the problem of too many books.  Yes, I could sell them back but they give you nothing and I would just as soon donate my excess bookage to the library.  There will be some culling of books and more reading -- always reading. So, anyway (as Ellen says)  that is what I have been up to for the last couple of weeks and what my foreseeable future looks like.  Hopefully my energy will bounce back after a good nights sleep and I will get back into some sort of a routine.  After two years of spending the majority of my time at somebody else's house I am going to have to reacquaint myself with my own and try to make it meaningful.  I guess I will just have to take it one day at a time and make it work.Oh, and by the way, I think the new Col.

{"title": "Saint Maybe", "date": "Friday, May 22, 2015", "text": "I just finished \"Saint Maybe\" by Anne Tyler.  I am not sure, at all, how to review this book.  I enjoyed it and I would recommend it but I am not sure how to describe my feelings about it.The story begins with the Bedloe family -- a real Beaver Cleaver sort of group.  They seem to have it all together with the parents, Claudia, Danny and Ian.  Slowly but surely the perfection begins to unravel.  Grandma is plagued with arthritis which is progressive.  Grandpa progresses from a rather opinionated man to a weak man.  Claudia is always just on the sidelines -- married with children and living away.  Danny, who is the focus in the beginning, finds love with the beautiful Lucy who comes complete with a shady past, very little background history and two children, Thomas and Agatha -- and a bun it the oven.  Is the bun Danny's?  We never really know.As the story progresses, Thomas and Agatha become central to Ian as Ian becomes their primary babysitter and consequently more and more involved in their lives.  More than once Lucy is late getting home which squelches Ian's plan with HIS lady love, Cicely.  Lucy's activities seems shady to Ian and he finally decides that she cheating on Danny.  After one evening of Lucy not coming home in time for Ian to meet Cicely, Danny comes home from a party rather drunk and Ian demands that he drive him home in spite of his altered state of being. During this drive home, Ian, angry because of his ruined evening, tells Danny that Lucy is cheating on him. Shortly after this exchange there is an accident killing Danny.  Everyone thinks it was an accident but Ian thinks it was suicide and he feels responsible.  Lucy's death shortly thereafter causes Ian to believe that he was instrumental in both of their passings which just multiplies the guilt.One particularly low evening Ian stumbles upon the Church of the Second Chance.  It is a non-mainstream church being conducted from a storefront -- but Ian hears the singing and is drawn in.  Here he finds Brother Emmitt who he confesses to and confides in.  Brother Emmett tells Ian that the way to make things right are to devote himself to the children that he feels responsible for making orphans.  That appealed to Ian's sensibilities and for the next 20 years he devotes himself to raising the children with his parents and becoming a master carpenter.  After his mother's passing and the last child, Daphne's, departure from the home, Ian finds his own life in the form of Rita -- a friend of Daphne and the owner/operator of \"Clutter Counselor\" -- a company who declutters houses.  She was hired by Agatha, now a physician living in California with her husband, to do something about the hoarding conditions that have come to be the norm in the Bedloe household. The book ends on an upbeat note with everybody having found their way and happy but for a bit it was a little depressing.  Not depressing enough to stop reading it but you could definitely feel Grandma going downhill health wise, you could feel Grandpa aging, you could feel -- and hear in their voices -- the children growing up -- but at the end it was all ok -- they had made full circle and it proved to be a very satisfying read."},
{"title": "Generations", "date": "Monday, May 18, 2015", "text": "I dabble in family history.  I have for a long, long time.  The internet has made is much easier to find information and photos and unknown living relatives.  Last night I was checking my Ancestry.com account and my DNA results which are ever changing.  I found a new photo of my great great grandmother as a young woman.  I have photos of her as an older woman, in 1942, but this was was taken probably in the 1870's.  The thing about it was -- it was like looking at my mother.  I might be the only one that sees the resemblance but it was so obvious to me.  I was so thrilled with the find that I thought I would share it here. My mom -- somewhere around 1940My grandmother -- not sure of the yearMy grandmother's grandmotherI had to blow this last photo up because it is quite small so obviously the quality is compromised.  My cousin, JLSHall is going to try to photoshop it a bit do clean it up.Anyway, my great great grandmother is Choctaw Indian -- at least half.  It seems that side of my family married into Indian communities regularly as there are many instances.  Yes, my Ancestry DNA still says I have no Indian blood.  This great-great grandmother had a daughter who was born on an Indian reservation between San Marcos and Austin and her Indian name was Poison Ivy.  She went by Ivy. So, that is my most recent genealogical find.  Aren't family trees wonderful?  Isn't DNA amazing.  Isn't the resemblance in these photos uncanny? I think so.A few weeks ago there was a Lilly Pulitizer for Target launch.  There were many clothing and household items.  It didn't go well.  Many of the children's items were scooped up by individuals with the intent to resell on ebay.  My daughter is a fan of LP and was going to buy one of the dresses for her daughter online. It didn't happen.  The online service didn't work and eventually crashed.  There was great gnashing of teeth.  Not by me.  I couldn't have cared less.  I don't stand in lines, I don't hover over the \"shopping carts\" online. However, I decided to come to the rescue so I scoured my stash for something bright colored.  I went through patterns to see if I could find a simple, shift dress in a size 5.  I had one by Burda.This is the final result.Apparently this filled the bill.  I did learn, however, that Joann's, at least the one I go to, doesn't stock hemming tape anymore.  I guess with surgers and such people don't use it anymore.  Anyway, the kiddo wore the dress to church yesterday, declared it very comfortable, requested more so I guess it was a success."},
{"title": "Hi! Remember Me? Cold, Tornadoes and a Book Review", "date": "Friday, May 08, 2015", "text": "Yes, I know....I have been a very inconsistent blogger of late.  However, I have been very consistently ill! Good to know I am keeping on top of SOMETHING!  For the last week I have had what I thought was a really bad allergy attack but I have come to believe it was a ....drumroll, please....cold. An old fashioned cold.  I haven't had one in so long I didn't recognize it but I do believe that is what it was.  It seems to be leaving me now even though I was still running a low grade temp last night.  I seem to be more normal today although a bit battered.  Hopefully the rest of May will be uneventful.I say that as we are facing severe weather the next three days.  If I were looking for an adjective to describe Texas to a non-Texan I would have to say \"extreme\".  We are extreme.  We never seem to do things moderately.  We don't just have a \"line of thunderstorms\" passing through -- we have multiple tornadoes and flooding and people drowning in their storms shelters and storm shelters popping out of the ground -- I mean, we rarely just have a day.  Oh we, do but they aren't very often or memorable.  So, I sat here last night watching the weather reporting through every commercial break showing us where the \"hook\" is, where the rotation is going.  I didn't feel well.  I contemplated getting dressed and finding my serviceable shoes -- something I haven't done for the last three days -- but decided against it.  I decided that if it were meant to be I would just be blown to Oz because I couldn't be bothered.  We didn't get a tornado where I live but there were signs of them closeby.  We did get a lot of wind and rain which blew under my back door.  I just spread out some towels and went to bed.  It is a lovely day today with more excitement promised for this evening.  Yay.Photo off the internet -- don't know who to credit but thanks!Not feeling well, no energy, and bad weather has given me time to do some reading.  I have always been the sort that hones in on a particular author and then set out to read everything they have written.  I have my favorite authors just like everybody does, I am sure.  However, the other day I had finished a book and was looking for something new to read and ran across an article about Anne Tyler.  It was interesting.  I then set out to read a blog by mlhall.com and lo and behold, he had written a review of an Anne Tyler book so I took that as a sign.  I went to my neighborhood Half Price Books and picked up two AT titles -- \"Back When We Were Grownups\" and \"Saint Maybe\".  I began with the first and was immediately drawn in.This is the story of Rebecca.  Rebecca with Will.  Rebecca with Joe.  Rebecca with four daughters.  Rebecca at 53 who discovers she has become a completely different person.  I could identify on any number of levels.  The book is so well written it was a joy to read.  The dialogue flowed beautifully, the humor natural, the descriptions were beautiful.  I could just envision the brownstone -- The Open Arms -- in all its dilapidated glory.  The family interaction is so, well, normal -- this could be anybody's family.  It was a great read -- it wasn't a mystery but it was definitely \"cozy\".  I would definitely recommend and I was sorry to see it end.  I have already started on \"Saint Maybe\" and it already has me hooked.But...you have to feel sorry for Will.  That is all I am going to say.So, folks, that is what I have been doing.  Not much, actually and trying to play catch up today.  Thankfully I feel good enough to do that.  Have a wonderful weekend and Happy Mother's Day to all my mom readers."},
{"title": "First Communion", "date": "Friday, May 01, 2015", "text": "Being brought up in the church I have always known about communion -- first and otherwise.  My first communion was in 1957 in Asbury Methodist Church, San Antonio, Texas.When I went there the carpet was blueWe had just built the \"new\" sanctuary, pictured above, and I was the first one to be baptized and take communion at the new altar rail.  It was quite an honor.  My mother was concerned that I was only seven, four years shy of the accepted \"age of accountability\" of eleven but our pastor, Brother Cox assured her that my decision -- and it was my decision -- was fine. My husband was raised in Northside Baptist Church in San Antonio, Texas and was a member there until we married and he became Lutheran.Fast forward to age 16.  I was disenchanted with the church I had been in since birth so I went \"church shopping\".  I landed in one of the biggest churches in town with a very large youth group which I never participated in.  The church was Concordia Lutheran Church, San Antonio.  I am probably sitting in the back of that second photo, left hand side as you are facing it, as that was my usual spot but I can't exactly locate myself in that very crowded photo.Hubs and I married here and our babes were baptized here and we decided to go church shopping again in the mid- 1980's.  After a few years at Redeemer Lutheran in San Antonio we ended up at Mt. Calvary Lutheran Church, in San Antonio and stayed there until we moved in 1990.  Mt. Calvary is where my son went through his first communion and confirmation training. He was under the tutelage of Pastor Kim DeVries -- a wonderful pastor, so good with kids.  He passed away just last year.1990 found us in Fort Worth, Texas -- not a heavily Lutheran area in the midst of the Bible Belt. We finally settled in on Christ Lutheran Church and this is where my daughter took her first communion and had her confirmation.  I would love to show you a photo but by the time my daughter reached confirmation age the church had sold its building of many years and was then located in a store front. About this time I had two ailing parents which required much care, regardless of the day.  I pretty much ceased going to church.  I was also put off by the politics that were alive and well in the Lutheran Church so I just decided to take the time off to re-evaluate my thoughts on all things \"church\".Even though my children were raised in the Lutheran Church, they were Catholic School educated.  I knew that even though I was going through a religious \"situation\" they would be fine as they were very deeply entrenched in the Word. My son was in college by this time and also doing his own religious exploration.  I didn't really know about it until he told me about the church he was going to that was originally an Episcopal Church that had gone back under the wing of the Roman Catholic Church.  He loved it.  It didn't surprise me.  He left the Lutheran Church to be Roman Catholic.  I was fine with his decision.  We didn't see him join this church, he didn't want us there.  I think this was just a journey he had to take on his own.About the same time my daughter was going through a journey of her own.  She didn't want to be Lutheran any longer so she started going to St. John's Episcopal Church with a friend of hers.  By this time my parental dynamic had changed and I was missing church.  I had done my \"thinking\" and was ready to move back into the realm of church but I knew I didn't want to go back to the Lutheran Church so I started attending St. John's with my daughter.  I felt like I had come home. My husband was on a long term assignment in Canada and when he returned for good he wanted to be filled in on everything that had happened that nine months.  I told him we converted. So, we all settled into our church homes and then the weddings commenced and the babies came and that brings us up to current time.Our eldest grandchild and only grandson is now eight years of age.  Last Sunday he received his First Holy Communion at St. John the Apostle Catholic Church.It was lovely.  I shed a tear.  That little baby that I kept for a while was growing up way to quickly.  I would post photos of him but his parents prefer that his photo not be put on the internet unless it is by the school.We had a lovely lunch with them at Brio Tuscan Grille in Southlake. It was delicious!There was cake.Our gift to the man of the hour was a hand tied Rosary (hand tied by me -- I love making these rosaries -- it is absolutely theraputic to sit and tie those knots). The twine comes from a company called Divine Twine, the instructions from a website called Rosary Army and the crucifix came from James Avery Jewelers, a Texas based jewelry company.And, last but not least, the proud parents of the young man.  I don't really talk about my son often because they are very private people but I am so proud of him and I love him so much and I can't help but post this photo.And I would be remiss if I didn't share this photo as well.  I speak often of the Hubs and I post rather unflattering photos of him in the yard and such so I thought I would share this one.  As I was taking it he was instructing me on the fine art of photography.  I didn't listen.  So, here is the Hubs.I wish I could post some photos of the grandson but I can't so I will leave you with this final pic -- my daughter and son-in-law also known as Bean's parents. It was a good day, a good meal, good company and I was thrilled to be a part of it."},
{"title": "Why?", "date": "Wednesday, April 29, 2015", "text": "The question circulating amongst bloggers the last couple of days is \"why do you blog\".  My answer is multi-faceted.When I was a child I was a voracious reader.  As as result I liked to write stories.  When I was in high school I did very well with creative writing and enjoyed it enough to continue as an adult.  However, as my family grew and my responsibilites became more numerous the writing went to the bottom of the list of priorities. One day my son mentioned that his friend, Tuesday, had a weblog.  I had no idea what that was so I started exploring.  I was fascinated and started reading blogs and then I decided I wanted one for myself.  So, in July of 2006 I wrote my first blog post.  My writing was sporadic and was broad based -- I didn't adhere to any particular theme like some bloggers do.  I just wrote about what was in my head at the moment -- that might explain some of the random posts -- there wasn't much in my head! However, it was an outlet to do a little creative writing. I enjoyed it as it wasn't a huge commitment of time.Somewhere along the line the whole concept of blogging changed for me.  I wasn't using it as a venue for creative writing anymore.  I was using it as a place to discuss interests.  As a result I was also reading more blogs and making comments and having discussions with people that came from all over the world.  It was fascinating to find people who were interested in the same things, struggling with the same things, talking about the same things all over the globe and there was no concern about race, age, or financial circumstances.  It definitely made the world a smaller place for me!Now, I blog for the community of it all.  I don't have a huge following probably because my posts are so varied -- and sometimes I just don't have a lot to say.   I like to do book reviews and I like to talk about cooking and crafts but what I mostly like is keeping up with my blog friends and family. I check my bloglist every morning and I love seeing what Mary, Bonnie, Gill and  Jane have been up to.  I keep up with Joy and Michael and their new life in the Hill Country. I love seeing the photos of the houses, the babies, the pets, the decluttering, the crafts.  Every morning when I sit down with my toast and tea I feel like I am having coffee with my friends.  If they haven't posted I worry about them.  I feel like I can confide in them and share my feelings without judgement. It doesn't matter where they are from, if they are younger or older or their circumstances -- they are interesting and I enjoy their company.So, that is why I blog.  Surprised?  Can't believe it has been so long since my last post but things have been busy.  Today is no different.  Hubs and I babysit full days on Tuesday and Thursday and just do after school pick-up Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  Well, I got a call a bit ago saying that Beanie is sick and our services are needed so off we go up north for the day.  Thankfully it isn't a repeat of the stomach virus but rather a sore throat.  Strep seems to be going around so we are hoping it isn't that but I am sure we will be visiting the doctor before too long. So, when I get back -- or if she falls asleep this afternoon -- I will be back to answer the question \"why?\".  I have been giving it some thought -- blogging that is -- and my answer will probably be surprising.So, until later, have a wonderful day.  Back soon!"},

{"title": "Ouch, Damn! and Treacherous", "date": "Friday, April 17, 2015", "text": "Look quickly because before too long it is going to be a thing of the past.  I am not a gardener.  I never said I was.  It wasn't part of the marriage contract.  And now I have gimpy knees.My husband used to tolerate yard work but never loved it.  I think it was forced on him so much as a child that he really has no use for it.  If we could have an apartment with a woodworking shop he would be content.  I don't blame him.  So, when we moved to this house in 2005 he was thrilled that the HOA dues included mowing of both the front and the back yards.  That was especially good for us because we have one of the biggest lots in this garden home community.Well, somewhere around 2007 we decided we needed something besides just grass.  Now, let it be said that I am fine with just grass but it was a little plain with just grass and a wood fence.  Stark is probably a better word.  So, we called in a landscaper and had a good deal of work done.  We extended the patio and had quite a bit of greenery put in.  It was lovely and it was all LITTLE.Over time we have lost some bushes, some have been damaged in the weather and some things we just lost interest for.  We have replaced, changed and added new stuff.   Skullcap The ongoing problem involves a vine -- well, two actually.  One must be called \"ouch, damn\" because that is what my husband says every time he tries to pull it out because the thorns are rather big and painful, even through gloves.  We don't know the name of the other one so my husband has not so fondly nicknamed it \"Treacherous\".  \"Treacherous\"Neither responds to any sort of removal technique.  They are prolific and have grown in and around and over everything.  Keeping this huge flower bed has become a complete nightmare.  Now, if we lived in a more temperate area where gardening could be more or less a three season activity it would be one thing but here it is too extreme and the gardening season is actually pretty short unless you want to completely die in 104 heat trying to wrestle with Ouch, Damn and Treacherous.  Neither of us like to do that so we are going to have to do something else.We talked about just removing everything except for the holly trees and just planting grass again.  I am sort of up with that but I think he hates to do that so we are going to take everything out except for the hollies, crab apple, Japanese maple and hackberry and plant Asiatic jasmine as a ground cover and call it done.  We will be keeping the big rocks though.  I am done with flower pots and hanging baskets and all that sort of thing.  I want to hose the patio down, get a beverage and sit down and just enjoy green.  We will be keeping the big blue pots by the gazebo because they work well with purslane.It looks under control but it isn't -- SO overgrownYou can't see the plants because of Ouch,Damn and TreacherousMagic Mushrooms -- yum!The Farmer in the DellThis is a huge Hawthorn bush that is totally covered by that Asian something or otherScrewy Japanese Maple Tree-- part of it died and broke and now we have this -- it may turn into Japanese Maple Bushfrom the backside looking back at the houseWhile I was out giving direction (haha!) I was looking around at the rest of the yard.  I am not an outdoor girl so I am usually surprised by what I find out there.  I heard a good deal of chirping -- like an argument -- and saw two female cardinals flying at each other.  When I walked closer each flew into a separate tree.  I think they each have a nest.  Then, I heard more chirping and looked up to see a large male cardinal.  Maybe it was him they were fighting over?  Hmm..not a good picture but this is the male cardinal and he was pretty bigThen, there was a squirrel running amok around the yard and over the fence.  I don't see squirrels regularly as we have no pecan trees around.  If I see them they are only passing through.Apparently as my husband was pruning and trimming he found a spot where something has dug under the fence to the property behind us.  I am thinking that is the passageway of the racoons that run through the yard.  We have had racoon, coyote, fox and rabbit in our yard.  However, since they built the apartment behind us we don't get to see those things anymore, just people coming in off the street dumping trash in the dumpster that the developers thought would be well placed right behind my house.  Yes.  Another story.So, anyway, look closely because I think all of this is going to be history and I can't say as I mind."},
{"title": "Playing", "date": "Monday, April 13, 2015", "text": "Remember childhood?  Remember playing?  I loved jacks, jump ropes and playing hopscotch.  I was afraid of roller skates and couldn't keep up with that darn skate key to save my life. I loved reading and coloring and playing games. Many hours were spent building a play house with quilts and lawn chairs under the gardenia bush with my cousin.  What happened to playing?Oh, wait! We still play, don't we?Sure we do! My playing tends to be more of the artistic variety these days but it is still playing.  I quilt and cross stitch and I am toying with the idea of making some cards.  I have even starting collecting a few tools for the projects -- rubber stamps, paper punches and such.And, I still color.I love these coloring books for grownups -- they are so detailed.  And I absolutely LOVE Crayola colored pencils.Ok, there is one other thing I do to play.  Not many people know this but I doodle.  Being the extremely untalented daughter of a pretty darn talented artist I kept my artistic endeavours to coloring and writing -- I like to write as well.  I always wished I had inherited the artistic gene but alas, it wasn't to be so I just avoided the whole situation.  Fast forward to the last couple of years.  Bean likes to draw and I think she will be a good little artist with time and a bit of training.  She likes company when she draws so I draw with her.  I have learned that doodling, even if it isn't great art, is very relaxing and theraputic.  I can easily get lost in it. I have also learned that it doesn't really matter if it is fine art -- if it is enjoyable that is all that matters.So, I thought I would introduce you to Arlo.  I love Arlo.  He is so....well...round.  And sweet.  He has a female counterpart named Gwendolyn but I couldn't find her.  She is round as well.There is a boat on the page behind and you can sort of see it -- not part of ArloI am sorry he is a bit blurry -- my hands shake a little bit and I sometimes I have a hard time holding the camera still.This is Arlo and Gwendolyn's tree.And a couple of their BFF'sHee hee -- they are so bad they make me laugh! I am such a silly ol' broad!"},

We are both gaining weight and it isn't a good thing so I will be spending some time today revisiting that.However, in the last week while I have been under the weather with the dreaded stomach bug something was drawn to my attention.  I hadn't eaten for a couple of days so I sent Hubs to the store for soup.  I like homemade chicken soup but that wasn't going to happen.  I requested plain, ordinary Campbell's chicken and rice soup.  Now, I haven't eaten this soup in years but I am pretty sure I remember what it tasted like.  He came home with the \"healthy\" stuff -- less sodium which is ok but this stuff was vile.  I mean, like spoiled vile.  There was nothing wrong with the can and I ate about a half cup of the broth before I realized that it was really wretched.  It was so bad that I hoped I didn't die in the night from ingesting it.  I didn't go back for more, clearly, and I didn't open another can to see if there was a difference.  Could it be that my taste has changed that much?  Could it be that the soup I ate all through my childhood was always that bad?I have found this with other stuff as well -- bread to be exact.  I simply do not like the taste of commercial bread.  I tried to eat a slice of toast this morning and I almost couldn't do it.  I have been making our bread for quite a while now and I guess I have changed my taste for it.So, is it me?  Have I just changed my taste for food?  Is our commercial food really this bad?  I will be going grocery shopping today as we are out of everything but I won't be buying anymore Campbell's soup.   I will be buying chicken and re-packaging it so that if the need arises anytime soon I will be able to make my own soup.  Hmm..just as I was about to retire the crockpot and bread maker I think I will need to reconsider.Food for thought -- literally."},

{"title": "Define \"Old\"", "date": "Wednesday, April 08, 2015", "text": "Yesterday my daughter was telling us of some comments one of her students made to her.  The student told my daughter that she couldn't believe she was in her mid-thirties because she didn't act like it! My daughter took that to mean that the student thought she was immature.  The student assured her that wasn't what she meant but she didn't particularly elaborate.  We went on to discuss how I saw my daughter and I told her that it was probably her physical appearance that brought the student to that decision and not her behavior because my daughter doesn't look much older than she did in high school.So, I couldn't leave it alone, could I?  I had to take it one step further, didn't I?  I had to ask -- \"do I seem old to you\"?  Her answer was -- \"no -- well, yes, sometimes\".  Hmmmm.......I think I need further clarification from her.  Is it my appearance?  Well, I am sure I look my age -- well, maybe not QUITE my age but not far from.  Is it my clothes?  Well, we do tend to differ in clothing styles.  Is it my attitude -- ok, every once in a while I open my mouth and my mother pops out -- I will agree but my mother had those attitudes when she was far younger than my age. I don't think I have \"old\" habits or mannerisms (and I absolutely loathe the color lavender).  I read a lot of the same books as my daughter and I still listen to rock and roll music -- current stuff as well as \"oldies\" (there is that word again), we watch the same movies and I am pretty current on pop culture -- I mean if those Kardashian girls were mine they would be so grounded!  I will admit to complaining about my joints hurting but then, they hurt when I was younger than my daughter is now. So, what makes us appear a certain way to other people?  Is it just because she knows my age or maybe if she feels older then I must be much older.  I don't know.  I look at people like Stevie Nicks, who is a couple of years older than me, and yes, she has aged very well in spite of herself.  In person I am not sure what she would look like but on television she looks pretty darn good.  I can't even comment on the recent media flurry of Christie Brinkley's appearance.  So, does this mean I should cut my hair so I don't look so much like a bag lady or maybe make it blond?  More makeup?  Yuck. I think I need to have more conversation with my daughter.  Or should I?  Hmmm...slippery slope, there, slippery slope.Recently I have been trying to read down my list of books on my Nook.  I was in the mood for something different and not too long.  So, I chose \"The Persian Pickle Club\" by Sandra Dallas.The setting is Kansas, the time period is the 1930's.  The main character is Queenie Bean, wife to Grover Bean and a member of the Persian Pickle Club.  The Persian Pickle Club is comprised of the women in the tiny community of Harveyville.  On the surface their main purpose is quilting but their relationship goes way beyond that of a needle and thread.  They are there to support each other in good times and bad -- to celebrate and to mourn -- and to solve a mystery.  The characters are strong, sassy and not without humor.  It is a good account of the mores of the day -- even small towns in Kansas had their standards, after all.  As I read this book I could just picture many of the characters as people I have known myself.  However, if this were a movie, Rita would have to be played by Jen Lilley of \"Days of Our Lives\" fame.I have never read any of Sandra Dallas's other works but I will in the future.  This was a fun read.  It was engaging, seemingly without typos and grammatical errors I am finding in so many e-books, and it ended well.  I would definitely recommend this book for a fast, light read.  I know, mystery doesn't sound light but this isn't really a mystery book it is.......well, you just have to read it for yourself."},

So, I expressed the concern that I didn't really want to get sick and even though I was at their house babysitting the Bean while the SIL was ill, I didn't go around him -- he was sequestered in another part of the house so I felt like I wasn't really exposed but I knew it wouldn't be that way with my daughter because I am the mommy she needed.  So, I took down the grocery list and we headed her way this morning knowing that we would not be staying -- SIL had taken off work to take care of his lovely wife.   Groceries procured I walked into the house only to find my SIL looking overwhelmed, daughter looking terrible, feeling terrible, running a fever and whining that I was her mommy and I was supposed to make her feel better (wish I could!), and the Bean tossing her cookies, pale as a ghost, sitting very still and not talking.  All I wanted to do was spray them all down with Lysol.But, I am afraid it is too late.Maybe it is just my imagination.  Maybe I am just having sympathy pains.Yuck."},
{"title": "It's Official!", "date": "Monday, March 30, 2015", "text": "I have crossed over that line between a little crazy and REALLY crazy.  I recently read a book entitled \"A Single Thread\" by Marie Bostwick.  It is the first book in the Cobbled Quilt Series and I read it, I really did. But....I can't find it.  I can't find it on the Nook or the physical bookshelves.  It has disappeared.  I even looked in the car but I am certain I read it digitally.  And in the process of looking for it I discovered that I have a digital copy of \"The Persian Pickle Club\" and a physical copy that I just purchased a couple of weeks ago.  I guess I am going to have to keep a list.  Bother.Well, moving along, I recently read \"A Single Thread\" by Marie Bostwick, the first in the Cobbled Quilt Series.  It is the story of Evelyn Dixon, a middle aged woman looking for a new life after an abrupt divorce.  She decided to take a trip, on her own, to sort things out and she decided on New Bern, Connecticut as the place to spend some time to gather her thoughts.  Her friends were surprised she was going to take off on her own, especially for someplace so far -- it is quite a distance from Fort Worth, TX to Connecticut!It took one day for Evelyn to realize that New Bern would be her new home.  It took one week for her to realize that it was exactly the right time and place for her to begin her dream of owning a quilt shop -- being her own employer -- being dependent on just herself.She set about making the dream happen with the help of several new friends -- Abigail, Margot and the angry Lizzie. They were an unlikely lot but proved to be just what she needed both business wise and personally.  It wasn't smooth sailing -- personal problems, business problems, health problems....but it was fun.I don't want to say too much because it was a really compelling story and I might get carried away and share too many spoilers.  Let me just say as a Fort Worthian that has always wanted to visit the Northeast, but probably never will, I had a strong visual of what the area looked like and what the quilt shop looked like.  I could even envision how I would decorate it if it were mine.  It was easy for form a mental image of all these women -- the book really came to life in my mind.I have now gone on to purchase the rest of the books in the series and will review when I read them.  I recommend this first title without reservation.  It was a good, cozy read.Now I am listening to Absolute Radio 60's from somewhere in the UK on my internet radio.  I love it! Had to stop writing to sing a little \"White Rabbit\".Grace SlickI do family history for my own family but I will admit that I have done some searching on my favorite celebrities and Slick is one that I have done some research on -- I was pleasantly surprised that she is a descendant of the Mayflower families but I can't remember which one.  Hm..I wonder if we are related -- we have the same nose only mine is a bit shorter.  Oh, and my people didn't come over on the Mayflower.  And I can't sing.  Oh well.Ah, I digress but I am enjoying feeling like a kid again with my favorite songs in the background -- but it sounds better than the transistor radios we used to carry around -- pre-ipods!Ok, I am just being silly now.  Time for laundry. Musing Mondays is a weekly meme that asks you to choose one of the following prompts to answer:I’m currently reading…Up next I think I’ll read…I bought the following book(s) in the past week…I’m super excited to tell you about (book/author/bookish-news)…I’m really upset by (book/author/bookish-news)…I can’t wait to get a copy of…I wish I could read ___, but…I blogged about ____ this past week…THIS WEEK’S RANDOM QUESTION: How old were you when you realized that you are an AVID reader?I haven't done a Musing Monday for a while so I thought I would join in this morning.  If you want to participate it can be found at adailyrhythm.com.I am not currently reading anything as I just finished the Lush Trilogy, much to my surprise.  It has been reviewed on my blog.  Up next I will probably continue one with \"My Antonia\" by Willa Cather which I started but abandoned to finish the first in the Cobbled Quilt series or I will begin \"The Persian Pickle Club\". In the last week I bought the second and third books in the \"Lush\" trilogy -- Hush and Crush.  I purchased them for my Nook.I am really looking forward to Jan Karon's new book coming out soon.  That one I will buy in hardback as I have collected the entire series and will continue as long as she continues to write them.  They have such a great, homey feel to them -- I love reading them in the fall -- it just seems appropriate.Random Question response --I always loved books and loved being read to as a child.  I remember, sometime before the age of five, watching my mother read the newspaper and asking her what it felt like to be able to read.  It was fascinating to me and somehow I just knew it would open up a whole world to me.  When I went to kindergarten at age five there were no curriculum guidelines deeming it illegal to teach us to read so off we went with the Dick and Jane books which I now understand were terrible learning aids.  Anyway, I remember sitting in a chair watching my teacher, Mrs. Pearce, with that great big Dick and Jane flip chart asking us to read the sentences.  I was thrilled.  When I was eight and just getting out of third grade we went on our end of the year picnic at San Pedro Park in San Antonio.  At the end of the day we were told that if we were eight and had a parent with us we could go to the library which was situated in the park and get a library card.  So, I was and I did so we went and I got my first library card.  I remember the children's section so well and the shelves that housed my favorite books by authors like Lois Lenski, Kate Seredy and Laura Ingalls Wilder.  I remember bringing home my new finds -- probably just one or two at a time -- and sitting curled up on the couch completely losing myself in those books.  My favorite time to read was when it was raining.  Most of the time it wasn't a cold rain as we were in San Antonio and my mother would leave the front door open and the windows open as long as it wasn't raining IN and I would read for hours to the rhythm of that slow rain.  I guess that is why I have always associated reading with rainy days -- there were many in San Antonio.  So I guess the answer to the question is that I have never known a time when I wasn't an avid reader or an avid listener -- either way I have never known a time when books weren't an integral part of my life."},
{"title": "Lush, Hush, Crush -- S. L. Baum", "date": "Sunday, March 29, 2015", "text": "Way back when I first obtained an e-reader I went a little mad.  I was downloading books left and right -- many were free, many hugely discounted, many full price and much more costly than I could have gotten elsewhere but I was having fun! The ultimate cost of that \"fun\" was that I have an e-reader full of books that, after further review, I am probably not so interested in.  However, with my inability to throw books away -- even digital ones-- I decided that it would be a great idea to just start reading through the list and then alternate with reading a physical book off the shelf because that is quite a list to go through as well. So, I was in the car one day looking for something to read and since I wasn't anywhere near a wi-fi connection I had to settle on the one and only book that I hadn't archived.  It was entitled Lush by S. L. Baum. I remember buying this book on the strength of a review but thinking at the time that it was an extreme diversion from my usual fare.  However, since I was desperate for something to read and this was the only title I could access I decided to give it a go.It is a young adult (YA) title, dystopian in genre and not something I would ordinarily seek out.  The story centers around a 17 year old girl named Bluebell living in a futuristic country called Concord.  Bluebell, as she finishes her time at Training Tech and is moving toward being assigned her career is shocked and somewhat dismayed when she is branded \"lush\".  It is a special brand and she is the only person who has received that brand in twenty years.  \"They\" don't remember the last person to receive that brand, \"they\" just remember there was one but don't remember what happened to her.  There are a lot of things \"they\" don't remember.  This, however, is the story of Bluebell and I won't say more because anything I say would be considered a spoiler.I didn't expect to get hooked by the book.  I figured I would get a few pages in and get bored or just put off by it but I didn't.  It didn't help that it ended in a cliff hanger.  I had to read the next book in the series.That book is titled Hush.  The story continues with enlightenment and awakening and a general feeling of unrest.  There is a movement afoot that is going to come to some sort of climax. In this book, the younger citizens of Concord are beginning to realize that the control over their lives, by The Council, isn't in their best interest after all.  They realize they have been lied to and that life in Concord isn't what they thought it was.Again....cliff hanger.Again...I purchase the third book -- Crush.Crush is the final book and from the title you would expect some huge conflict -- a battle so to speak.  This is where it all fell flat.  There was a rather big build up to the end and the reader would expect some sort of an event -- I mean, when you think of a group overthrowing a government you think in terms of a bigger conflict and I kept waiting but it never came.  There was just not the bravado that  I was expecting.  It all just ended in a rather uncomplicated way which didn't gel with the rest of the story which was filled with complicated descriptions and situations and relationships.  While the books were compelling enough to obviously keep me coming back for more -- I mean, I had to see what was going to happen next, like on \"Days of Our Lives\" -- I was disappointed in the ending.  I was expecting something a little bit more like \"The Lottery\" or \"Anthem\" -- a little more drama.  I almost felt like the author was tired of writing and just tied things up quickly to get it done. I didn't enjoy the ending.However, when I sat back and thought about the intended audience I suppose the author was trying to keep an age group in mind but, with that said, I just thought there could have been more.  Would I recommend?  Well, if you like this genre and are a young adult of about 13 years old, then yes.  There wasn't anything particularly frightening about it like the above mentioned titles.  There was no violence or sex.  For the most part it was pretty sugar coated and I think, for the intended audience it was fine.  For me, not so much.Yet, I still kept on reading so what do I know?  I know I will be moving away from the YA group for my next read!"},

{"title": "Great Aunt Again!", "date": "Sunday, March 22, 2015", "text": "I am a great aunt -- again.  I have two great nieces and five great nephews!  Why in the world does the term \"great (or grand) aunt\" sound so much older and more decrepit than grandmother?  You say great aunt to me and I see lavender.  Anyway, the newly arrived is Blake and belongs to my nephew.  From the pics on my phone he is robust and lively.  So glad to welcome him to the ever growing throng of young ones to the family.No, not me making rash promises but rather a Christian novel by Shelley Gray.  I believe this is one that I got free off the Barnes and Noble \"Free Friday\" offering or maybe BookBub.  Wherever I got it I am sure it was free. \"A Texan's Promise\" is the story of Clayton Proffitt, a ranch hand who had come to the Circle Z Ranch after the Civil War to work for the Grant family.  He was a traumatized man, straight from the war but his faith was in tact.  It was here that he met the 13 year old Vanessa.  No, there was no improper behavior, he just became her confident for the next six years.  During that six years, Vanessa's father passed away and her mother married again, not for love but for support and she made a very bad choice in the form of Price Venture.  He was a poor excuse for a man and when the story actually begins, he is found beating and attacking Vanessa.  Clayton takes her away and their story begins. This is a Christian-based book.  I am a Christian so I had no problem with that, in fact, it was refreshing.  The book didn't white wash things and gloss over the negative.  It dealt with beatings, rape, suicide, gun fights, chases, hard travel, etc.  It was a good read with one exception.  It was draggy in places.  I noticed that during the characters travel from Texas to Colorado every few miles they would look at each other and their relationship would change.  I found that to seem like a device to just drag out the story because nothing was happening to make their relationship change.  The book is the first in a series and, while I enjoyed it, I don't think I will rush to read the next one.  It was enjoyable, definitely Christian fiction so it won't be for everyone, and I am glad I read it but I recommend with reservation."},
{"title": "Past, Present, Future", "date": "Saturday, March 21, 2015", "text": "My friend Mary writes two beautiful blogs -- Frugally Challenged and Trundling Through Life.   She has written a series of posts about her childhood and her grandparents home in England.  I read these posts with great interest because I am a lover of family history and have researched my own for more years than I care to admit and continue to do so to this day.My grandparents in San Antonio, Texas, probably on their wedding day 1918Mary and I have been talking about how important it is to preserve the past for the future generations and not forgetting that the present will someday be the past for the youngsters.  Mary has talked about life at her grandparents house, how the house ran, what kind of activities took place -- just everyday things that probably nobody thought to document anyplace -- it was just life.  It is the same of all of us, even now.  I would never think to get up of a morning, put  a load of wash in and go in and write a diary entry about it and our foremothers and fathers didn't either.So......about two years ago I started babysitting my  granddaughter full time.  At the time I decide to start a daily journal for her describing our days.  That project lasted about half a week because it became extremely repetitive and most days were not chock full of journal worthy happenings.  So, I am afraid I abandoned the project before it even really began.However, after having these conversations with Mary I began to rethink the whole project and decided to take a different approach.  I went to my local bookstore and bought this journal --frontbackIt is very hardbacked and sturdy and gives the appearance of being hand bound but we all know that isn't true -- only hobbyists hand bind books anymore but I digress. The format of this book is Letters to Caroline.  I am writing her a letter when we do something -- like the outings we had during spring break -- or when there is something I want to tell her.  I recently wrote her a letter about our Advent activities this last Christmas and I talked about how the tiny shepherd got broken, how she felt about it and how Mary had written one of her blog posts about it.  I printed out the blog post and it is attached to the page for her to go back and read one day.  I am not including this to make her feel badly about the figurine getting broken but just letting her see how our life was at that particular time.  She absolutely loves my pumpkin bread.  There is nothing unusual about it -- the recipe is from a Betty Crocker cookbook -- but I am going to write her a letter about it and include the recipe so she can one day make it herself and she will remember that ordinary, day-to-day activity.  Of course, we will make it together someday and I will write her a letter and maybe that letter will invoke the aroma of baking pumpkin bread.  I know this probably sounds like a silly thing to do -- most people would think it a waste of time and view me as a silly woman with nothing better to do, perhaps living in the past a wee bit too much.  Well, the reality is, I have nothing better to do than to nurture a child and instill a sense of family, of roots, of love that surpasses all generations and time.  I wish that my parents, grandparents and more would have done something like this for me and my cousins.  I wish I had had the foresight to ask questions but the young don't, do they?  So, I am hoping by doing this project, our Beanie will have memories to pass on to her own -- or at least a pumpkin bread recipe."},
{"title": "The Great Bed Pillow Saga", "date": "Friday, March 20, 2015", "text": "It just hasn't been the same since the \"accident\".  \"It\" being my shoulder and the \"accident\" being awakened from a sound sleep with my arm over my head -- apparently all night -- and not being able to move it.  It was frozen in place.  It was painful.  It took a bit of time to get it mobile again and, as I said, it has never been the same.After that I found that sleeping on my requisite two pillows, materials of unknown origin -- probably synthetic fluffy stuff - only aggravated my shoulder.  Now, I have always slept on two pillows due to allergy issues affecting my ears but that is another story entirely. So, I went on a quest to find the perfect pillow.  It seems it would have to be something rather deep -- at least 6 inches to accommodate the shoulder and to deal with the stuffy-head problem.  It would need to stay firm and lofty.  I came home with yet another regular pillow with fluffy-stuff and Hubs came home with a Bucky Duo buckwheat/millet pillow.  He was happy as a clam because he feels a pillow should be no thicker than an envelope and me -- well, not so much.  The new fluffy-stuff pillow fell flat and the shoulder was getting stiffer and stiffer. I finally decided I would try the Bucky, went out and purchased one, came home and declared it another fail and it has sat in the closet for a couple of years now.About three months ago when I realized the shoulder was now painful and not just stiff I decided something had to be done.  So, back out we went on another quest.  This time I came back with the Tempurpedic Cloud pillow.This was the ticket! The first night I fell sound asleep without having to adjust and readjust the fluffy-stuff.  I slept like a baby -- well, one without sleeping issues anyway.  It was perfect.  I was in LOVE.  I swore I would never go anywhere without my pillow -- it would travel with me, it would go on sleep-overs with Bean .  It would be my forever companion. Fast forward two months.Daughter and son-in-law bought a new Tempurpedic bed.  Hubs and I were there for the delivery.  The delivery people unwrapped the lovely, white platform of indescribable comfort -- I know because I have had one for about ten years now.  The difference between their new mattress and mine, other than the \"new\" factor was the odor.  Stench is probably a better word but whatever you call it there was a definite chemical off-gassing that got worse with time.  By the end of the day we had the bedroom windows open and the door shut.  They called the mattress store and were told -- \"oh yeah, they need to be aired for a couple of weeks before you can sleep on them\".  Really?  So, daughter decided to do some research while she was waiting for the mattress to air and was shocked at the reports of the toxicity levels of the mattresses and the pillows. It didn't seem to affect the Tempurpedic brand alone -- all memory foam mattresses seem to have a level of toxicity.  The mattress was returned to the store much to the dismay of the sales staff -- they just couldn't understand why somebody would want to return something of such incredible comfort.  Clearly they never read any research on their products.I don't remember any odor with my pillow but then, my sense of smell is greatly compromised so I might have missed it but Hubs didn't mention it.  However, I decided to err on the side of caution as I am very chemically aware these days and I took the pillow back.  Minor miracle -- I found the receipt. Then, yes, the quest began again and I came home with a down-alternative variety pillow.  It said on the packaging that it \"sleeps like down and acts like down\".  Well, it does but I don't know what snapped in my brain but -- I don't like down pillows.  Another fail but it is a well made pillow and it should be because I paid enough to buy a whole gaggle of alternative ducks!Ok, by this time I am getting a bit fed up with the quest -- my attention span is only so long, you know and all those white bags of fluff, fake fluff, foam -- toxic or otherwise were all beginning to look alike and I was beginning to wonder if maybe the Japanese were smart to just sleep on a block of wood.  Chemically untreated block of wood, of course.So, I decided to channel my inner hippie and give the Bucky Duo another try.Now this pillow is double chambered -- one containing buckwheat hulls and the other containing millet.  It is literally a bag of birdseed.  It comes with a lovely, soft covering that can be removed for laundering.  I finally took the plunge and slept on it for one night and I couldn't believe it!  It was absolutely delightful -- well, almost delightful.  The first night was an exercise in re-adjusting the pillow every time I turned over which is a lot.  The second night it was better.  I was sleeping without a regular pillowcase so I added that and the cozy meter went up several notches.  By the third night I didn't notice the rustling of the hulls anymore.  I finally put on my silk pillow case which helps the frizzy, out of control curls and it has now become just as good as the tempurpedic pillow and it doesn't feel flat at all!  I can sleep on my back, which I don't much, but it feels good and on my sides all I have to do is punch it up a bit and I am elevated to an acceptable height.  The shoulder isn't hurting, my stuffiness isn't any worse and I feel so -- sustainable!Who knew that sleeping on a bag of birdseed could do that for you! Of course, in the early days I decided to try stacking my husbands pillow and mine to see if I could get the height and it worked out well so I ordered another.  However, Bed Bath and Beyond has been so slow in filling the order that I have become so comfortable with the single pillow and I wonder if I jumped the gun on ordering a second pillow -- I really don't need it -- but it will come in handy for extra hulls if we need them.So, the lessons learned here?  Always, always, always research products you are going to purchase that could affect your health -- that seems to be everything these days.  Keep an open mind to truly alternative ideas and never underestimate the power of the birdseed.  Also, one last thing -- it is ok to come out of the hippie closet -- even at my age.  Now I even have the hair for it -- long and wild."},

So, I took several photos before my camera died but I didn't get photos of everything but I think you will get the idea.  Enjoy!this is the haunted cabinblacksmith shopThe Parker Cabin is a cabin owned by the uncle of Cynthia Ann Parker who was kidnapped as a child by the Comanche Indians here in Texas.  She lived until adulthood as an Indian, married an Indian and had children, one of which was the famous Quanah Parker, the last Comanche chief.  She was located as an adult and brought back to her white family but she was never happy and finally died -- of a broken heart they say.  Cynthia Ann Parker is a sad story all the way around.Cynthia Ann ParkerQuanah Parker After we roamed around the park for awhile we went to lunch and back home.Seems we go to lunch a lot!"},
{"title": "If It's Not One Thing......", "date": "Sunday, March 08, 2015", "text": "it's another.  Last week was challenging, in a way.  My son-in-law was scheduled to be away for work so I was going to spend a couple of nights at my daughter's house -- more for my own convenience than her's but Mother Nature had other ideas. The week prior our weather had been miserable but we were certain it was over.  Just goes to show that you can never be \"certain\" when you speak of the weather, especially in Texas.  So, I went to my daughter's on Sunday night and Monday returned home as planned.  However, the weather reports were looking grim so I packed for the duration and I am glad I did.  I returned to her house on Monday evening so I would be there to babysit on Tuesday morning.  The day progressed as usual, we had a lovely evening watching even more weather reports.  The sleet/snow was supposed to come in on Wednesday afternoon.  My granddaughter got stuck at school the week prior when we had ice and they closed school early so my daughter was afraid the same would happen if I went home on Wednesday so granddaughter was kept home and there we stayed.And the rain and snow came.  And came.  All night.  We had about 7 inches of accumulated yuck.  Of course, there was fun time playing in the mess and snowmen built and snowballs thrown but I find that sort of weather to be depressing so I wasn't particularly happy.  My daughter's school was cancelled so we just sort of \"hung out\" and played games and watched tv.  As the day progressed the conditions really improved and I was able to get myself home late Thursday afternoon.  Son-in-law dodged cancelled flights and all was well in our world.However, I just crashed -- in bed by 9 p.m.  Woke up Friday still a bit drained but the day went smoothly -- no more bad weather.  Friday was again an early night but I felt like I was getting back to normal and then.....wait....here it comes....Daylight Savings Time!I really dislike the time change.  When I was a kid we didn't do this.  I know it was done during WW2 (before my time) but from 1950 until sometime in the 60's we just lived on normal, God's time.  When it was re-implemented (is that even a word?) in the 60's we teenagers thought it was wonderful.  Yes, we were tired but it was light really late and how cool was that.  Fast forward to now -- not so cool anymore.  What used to not bother me in my youth sort of drives me crazy now.  I think we should just leave it alone.  Pick one -- decide on one -- and leave it alone!So, my tidying has been interrupted for a week which is fine.  I am in no hurry to get done.  I want to get all things tidied up but I want to do it thoughtfully -- I want to re-evaluate things in my home but I don't want to just throw things away willy-nilly -- I want to be in control of what I do. This morning, in anticipation of grocery shopping later, I decided to tackle the pantry.  I have a \"before\" photo which I will share when I have an \"after \" picture which should be in a little while.  I am completely appalled at the \"stuff\" in my pantry.  It is a standard sized pantry, nothing particularly large (or small) but I am a bit short and the upper shelves are a challenge.  If I put heavy things up there -- like bags of flour -- I have difficulty getting them down but the fact is, I can't place everything at eye level.   So, I am never sure what to do about this cabinet.  I bought a bunch of glass jars to store things in, like staples but they take up so much room and I don't think they were a very good choice.  I avoid plastic but these glass jars are heavy as well -- empty.  So, I am rethinking that whole thing.I am also rethinking the concept of stocking up.  My sensibility tells me to stock up, stockpile, hoard, if you will, for almost any eventuality.  However, I don't have room for that and it seems like I throw way too much away because we don't use it quickly and it goes out of date.  I don't know if it is better to just shop week to week, or every two weeks as my mother did, or to buy up a lot and risk losing it.  I am also having difficulty cooking for two people whose eating styles  are poles apart.  After cooking for my husband for almost 43 years it has come to my attention that he doesn't like my cooking.  I love veggies and grains, he is all meat, not a lot of potatoes and everything fried.  It has become the norm for us to eat out.  I know that is bad but it seems to be the only way for each of us to get what we would like.  It makes me very aggravated, though, to go to the store to buy groceries, bring them home, put them away and never cook.  It is so seldom that I cook that I almost can't remember how.  As I threw this stuff way today I am pondering whether it would be better to just buy breakfast/lunch things and just give up and go out for dinner.  I don't know what the solution is but I find the whole process to just be annoying. So, spring break has begun and I am not at my daughter's this week so I hope to get more tidying done, more organizing done.  I need to get my photos in some order.  I really have a feeling that I will never get finishing tidying.So, back to the pantry. More later. Rant over."},

I bundled up, Hubs drove, he dropped me at the door, parked and waited for me to call him on the cell phone when I was done.  It looked like a real covert operation and I was the shady character swathed in black.  Anyway -- I was pleasantly surprised that they were well stocked, the store was almost totally devoid of customers and I was thankful that Target is right across the street.However, I am a bit dubious about the prediction of thundersleet.  We have had thundersleet before and I don't like thunder and I don't like sleet so chances are I am not going to be thrilled by thundersleet.  We aren't having snow or anything lovely and wintery like that -- it is ice.  Fortunately it will be gone by Wednesday --or so they say.  Hopefully they will close the schools so my family can stay safe.  But one thing is for sure -- I now have lots of milk.A little dark but this is my patio puddle which could become an ice rinkYou can't see the rain -- lots and lots of rain"},
{"title": "Standing Folded Clothes", "date": "Wednesday, February 18, 2015", "text": "In my last post I talked about tidying up vs. straightening up and how to store clothing properly -- according to Marie Kondo.  It was difficult to explain how to store folded clothes standing up -- the clothes standing up, not me -- so I took a few snaps to illustrate.Jeans and shortsbetter shot of the shortsunmentionables -- sorry! But it is a good illustration of what I am talking aboutt-shirts and a polka dot blouse - I have added more to this drawer todayIt takes a bit of fiddling to figure out how to fold them to get them to fit in the drawer without essentially wadding them up into a little ball but it seems each piece of clothing has a way it wants to go -- a natural fold.  I have tried with dress pants that are slipperier fabric and I am not sure about that so I am thinking of just hanging those with the appropriate blouses as a set.  I have started on pajamas and have folded the two pieces together so they are stored as a unit.So far so good.  I have put more things in the donation bag and am starting on a third bag.  As I fish through the closet I am realizing that I don't wear hardly anything that is in there and it is so smashed that I can't really see anything I have -- whether I wear it or not.  Hopefully by folding the clothes I will be able to see them more readily and have more hanging space.  Once I sift through the hanging clothes, I hope to have more hanging space.It will be time to go shopping.  Hahahah!"},
{"title": "Doing the No Snow Happy Dance", "date": "Tuesday, February 17, 2015", "text": "Good morning!  I am so doing the No Snow Happy Dance! Our illustrious weather people have been teasing us all week about the possibility of snow and very frigid temps.  Weatherperson fail!  No Snow!  It is cold but it isn't what I would call frigid and it is going to be in the 50's this afternoon!Babysitting today but planning my next \"tidy\" project for tonight.  It has to be something small and easy to get accomplished.  I think the trick, for me anyway, is to choose projects that can be finished and don't become monumental.  I have a very large window seat in our bedroom which sort of acts as Junk Central -- I started on it yesterday and I might just continue with it tonight and if I can get it completely cleared that will be a win!  Keeping it clear will be a challenge because it just roars at me \"come set stuff here instead of putting it away properly\".  I will have to ignore the voices in my head but I think that will be my goal for this evening.  Maybe I will set a timer and see how much I get done.  The closet still needs work but I am getting there.  My friend Jane said she can't visualize \"standing\" clothes so I will take some photos and show you.  When I was ready to get dressed today it was so easy because I didn't have to search for my clothes -- it worked really well.  I can see where it will be helpful in not accumulating too much because I only have so much drawer space.  However, as Kondo said in her book, by rearranging everything and sorting I got a real good idea of what I have, what needed to be discarded and what needs replacing. I think the reason that Kondo's book resonated with me so much was that it shows that cleaning is an ongoing process.  I guess eventually you get done, weed out enough so that you really know what you have and what you require but it isn't the rushed project that so many people who promote minimal, clutter-free living make it sound.  Like my friend Rhonda says -- housekeeping is never ending so there is no sense in trying to finish it.  I think my problem is having things in a logical order and things stored away in logical places.  I am finding the oddest variety of things in the oddest variety of places so I think if I can bring order to the chaos I will look at housekeeping completely differently and finally allow myself some time to do the fun stuff without the guilt.Speaking of chaos -- whoever said \"a load a day keeps the chaos away\" spoke the truth.  I have found that by doing at least one load of laundry a day keeps the laundry under control and it becomes a much smaller job.  It doesn't pile up, it doesn't mean hours of washing, drying, folding.  It makes things manageable.  So, that is my tip of the day which I blatantly stole from somebody else.  But, it is good advice.So, on with the day! With no snow, it has to be a good one!Oh, my Tidy Score is 2 bags for donation and one for trash.  Will update."},
{"title": "Tidying -- New Definition", "date": "Monday, February 16, 2015", "text": "I will be the first to say that I am an odd duck.  A bit eccentric, a bit set in my ways, a little quirky and I pretty much live by the concept of \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\".  However, one of my quirks is driving me crazy. I am completely incapable to doing something like read or craft if I have something hanging over me that needs to be done.  Generally, as long as I am doing SOMETHING -- like a load of laundry -- I can justify reading or doing a bit of stitching but when I notice that things have gotten out of control then I am done -- I have to do something about it before I can enjoy the fun stuff. So, I have been reading a lot of \"minimalist\" blogs which, in essence, really don't say much.  It is mostly \"throw everything away\", \"only have 33 pieces of clothing\" (yeah, right), \"you can't organize clutter\" -- all of which are correct statements -- well, except for the 33 pieces of clothing.  However, none of them tell you HOW to do it! There are no tips, no hints, no guidelines, NO PICTURES -- nothing.I happened across a book the other day titled \"The Life Changing Magic Of Tidying\" by Marie Kondo.  I bought the book for my e-reader completely expecting to read the same ol', same ol'.  I was wrong.  Marie Kondo is Japanese and the book is infused with Japanese ideas of life style.  A lot of what she has to say is calming and promotes a peaceful way of living.  It sound wonderful.  A lot of it, however, borders on guilt! Like, how can you mistreat your socks!  Well, this is right up my alley because if there is something that needs to be felt guilty about I am the person to take care of that.  I am the most guilt ridden person on the planet.  I digressThe thing that I noticed right off was that her definition of \"tidying\" is different than mine.  Her idea of \"tidying\" is going through everything, tossing, donating, whatever then finding a place for everything and keeping it there.  When I was a kid, that is how I cleaned my room -- I would go off on binges, throw things out, rearrange my bookselves, re-do the closet but to me that was cleaning.  Tidying, to me, means making sure all the stray dishes are picked up before going to bed, hanging the towels up, putting the laundry in the hamper -- you know -- straightening up.  As Kondo talked about \"tidying\", I remember how great it used to feel when I would go on one of my binges and \"re-do\" the linen closet or the pantry.  It felt good.  So, even though Kondo suggests doing all the cleaning out -- of the whole  house -- at one time, by category not taking an area at a time. I decided to tackle \"places\" and see what happened.Let me just say that my husband loves drawers.  We have lots of drawers in this house which is good, we should be organized.  However, not so much.  The drawers are just a convenient place to stick stuff randomly with no plan.  So, I started with my nightstand.  There are three drawers.  I cleaned them out and organized what stayed.  I am happy with the way that turned out. I then turned my attention to the closet.  We have a very large closet -- it could be a bedroom and we have three chests of drawers in there as well as hanging space.  I have one side -- haha -- the small side and Hubs has the other.  I find that my side of the closet is always a mess.  Now, granted, my side houses other things besides my clothes -- like blankets and pillows and other stuff but it shouldn't be the mess it is.  I have a really bad tendency to drop things on the floor.  Why?  Well, it is because, in spite of having all this space, my clothes are hard to put away because I am in the habit of hanging everything and even though I have culled a lot of clothes, the hanging space gets really crunched.  Kondo says, in her book, that most clothing should be folded and most people think it should be hung.  She also said that clothes, once folded, should be stored standing up, pieces next to each other rather than stacked on top of each other.  She says that when you stack the clothes one top of each other they act as a press, insuring wrinkles.  However, if you stack them next to each other it avoids wrinkles.  I was very doubtful until I started folding the clothes and stacking them next to each other. I was amazed that you could actually stack them like that! Plus, you can see each piece without having to sift through the stack messing it up when what you want is on the bottom. Time will tell if there are less wrinkles.So far I have worked through half of one dresser in the closet.  I have filled two bags of donation items and one bag of trash.  My socks are organized -- oh yes, never ball your socks up -- it ruins the elastic in the top -- Kondo rule.  My jeans are all folded and standing up and I have more room in the drawer.  I have started folding t-shirts and blouses.  Yes, you can fold a blouse small enough to stand up.  I will let you know about the wrinkles tomorrow!Even though I am not following Kondo's advice exactly, I am having a good time \"tidying\".  My mom used to call it a \"clean out\" but whatever you want to call it -- it feels good.  I am finding it rewarding to tackle one area and actually completing it rather than running all over doing things hit and miss.  Kondo says to tackle things by catagory beginning with clothing (photos and sentimental things last) but I am accomplishing what I need to accomplish by doing it an area at a time.  I think you have to be flexible to get the job done. So,  that is what I have done today.  I have learned to fold all my clothes, stand them up, throw things away and discover that I really have a lot more storage space than I thought -- it just all depends on how you arrange it. Now I have to figure out what to do with my vintage handkerchief collection -- keep it, sell it, toss it -- such decisions."},

While some people might have found fault with those on religious grounds I doubt many would have been embarrassed by them.Then, when I was a teenage, many of my \"dates\" took place at my house with my boyfriend and I watching the weekly Saturday night movie.  At some point during this time I became aware of commercials for personal feminine products of all sorts.  I was beyond embarrassed and tried to talk over the commercials.I got over it because clearly they weren't going away.However, in the last few days I have been aware of a new sort of offensive commercial -- during prime time tv.I wasn't embarrassed but rather angry when a commercial came on promoting the \"morning after\" pill.  I was livid.  This was during prime time when young people would be watching.  Call me old.  Call me prudish but I think this was highly uncalled for.  Seriously.Then, last night, I got to view -- on prime time -- the steamy commercials promoting the upcoming show \"Fifty Shades of Gray\".  I have never been one to be in favor of censoring books -- I don't believe in book banning -- I think parents should be involved enough with their children to know what they are reading/watching/surfing, etc.  But, the fact that this commercial was being frequently run when children could be watching was not a responsible action for the network.  Again, I was angered.  I am well passed the age for needing anything \"morning after\" and in my world, the fifty shades of gray could describe my hair color but I found these two commercials being offered during prime viewing time on television to be an invasion of parental rights.  It seemed to me that the networks are taking on a position to \"educate\" their viewers even if they are only trying to sell products, never thinking that the viewers are children and that right to \"educate\" should fall on the shoulders of the parents.I know that there will be people who disagree with me but I found the commercials to be offensive and possibly dangerousOk, I am old now.  Tottering off my soap box."},

{"title": "Dreams and Memories -- Memories and Dreams", "date": "Sunday, February 08, 2015", "text": "In my  previous post I shared some of my memories of one of my childhood homes.  It was a small, white tract house, vintage 1950's, with a dark blue roof and royal blue shutters.  I called it \"my little blue house\" and I felt so secure there even though my mother was never fond of the house.  She loved the house I was born in but for some reason, unknown to me, we didn't stay in that house but moved to the \"little blue house\" and she was never really happy there.I was, however.  I loved to go out into the huge back yard and chase horned toads -- lizards common to Texas that are now practically extinct. I loved to pick the buttercups that grew wild and I was fascinated by the twisting, sinewy mesquite trees -- two of them -- that just grew naturally in the yard. This little house was my world, as most kids houses are, so it is no surprise that when I started having recurring dreams, the house would figure significantly in those dreams. I have always been a dreamer -- not a day dreamer but I dreamed a lot -- I still do.  One recurring dream that I had regularly until I was about nineteen revolved around the house.  A bit of back history -- when I was still very little my mother would warm my pajamas in front of the bathroom heater   so that after my bath I would have warm pajamas.  I was still in diapers and I wore plastic diaper covers that were common at the time. We would run the bathroom heater on really cold days to just help warm up that part of the house so one day, clever little me, decided the thing to do would be to \"warm up\" my plastic pants so I laid a pair over the bathroom heater and toddled off.  It didn't take too long for my mother to notice the odor of melting plastic and again with the panic.  I was fine, not even in the room but I surely could have burned the house down.  I am sure my mother said something to that effect, probably in a high pitched voice and I am sure that is where the recurring dream originated.In the dream my mother, father, cat and I were standing on the curb looking at our house and it was on fire.  I even drew a picture of it at school which was very disturbing to my mother.  I was afraid of fire -- I didn't like the gas stove which made cooking in home economics class really difficult -- and the dream continued on a regular basis.  Then, when I was nineteen, the \"little blue house\" caught fire and was gutted.I never had the dream again.After I became an adult, my dad and I talked a lot about this dream and I finally told him of another dream I had been having for a long time.  It was then that he mentioned a concept he had read about called DNA memory -- the idea that it is possible to inherit memories from our ancestors through our DNA.  I hadn't heard of it and didn't pay too much attention to it -- it was a little \"out there\" for me.  However, as I continued to have the second dream I started thinking about it because this dream took place in a different time period.  Each time I am on the bus going downtown.  The bus stops at a stop sign before crossing a railroad track.  I look out the window and see my grandfather talking to another railroad employee as they stand on the track -- even though that incident is in my dream, it really did happen when I was about 6 or 7  and it just kept on showing up in the dream.  As the bus crosses the railroad track we are no longer in current time but back in the 1800's.  In the dream I am travelling down North Flores Street which runs behind Fox Tech High School and as I look to my left the school is there but as I look to my right there is a row of old, white Victorian houses -- with black trimmed window screens and I stop in front of one of the houses.  There is a horse and buggy parked in front of the house and I stand and watch.  People come out of the house and get into the buggy -- the woman was dressed in a long, calico dress with long sleeves and a high neck. I feel like I know these people but I can't see their faces.  I can't identify them.  Then the dream is over.So......my husband and I were planning a trip to San Antonio, just the two of us, and I asked if we could travel that route and see what was there since it had been years since I had been in that area. I got very curious when we reached the stop sign at the railroad track.  As we ventured across the street the school was to our left and yes, to our right was a row of old, white Victorian houses.  My eyes came to rest on one house and I knew that was the house of my dream.  I came home and did a bit of research and, to the best of my knowledge, none of my family ever lived on this street -- at least on any of the censuses.  Why would I know this house?  Why would I be drawn to this house? I never had the dream again. I have found other memories to come to the forefront of my mind through dreams -- things I had forgotten about but felt I should be able to remember and then there it was in a dream and suddenly I remembered -- and continue to remember these forgotten memories.I could talk about dreams that I have had that I believe are visitation dreams but that is another post altogether and maybe someday I will share those but I think it would be hard to convey those dreams in words but they were very special at the time and they continue to be vivid and relevant.So, do you dream?  Are you memories linked to dreams?"},
{"title": "MEMORIES", "date": "Friday, February 06, 2015", "text": "One day at work, years and years ago,  there was a conversation about memories and the question was asked of me \"what was your first memory\".  Of course, the lady asking the question was one of the disagreeable sort so she immediately disputed me saying that I  most certainly couldn't remember \"that\" -- I just remembered what somebody had told me.She was wrong.  I was born in San Antonio, Texas in February, 1950.  We lived in a house on a street named Zilla.  The name of the street was later changed to Clower but that was after we had moved. I don't remember living in the house on Zilla as we moved when I was ten months old to a house on Lee Hall Street, about five blocks away.  The neighborhood was typical of the time -- small white houses clad in asbestos shingles with colored roofs and matching window shutters.My cousin who lived across the street -- if you look to the left in the distance, you will see our white fence Each house was approximately 950 square feet and was placed on a very large lot with two Arizona Ash trees in the yard, at the curb, and a couple of bushes by the front steps.  These houses were part of the post-War housing boom -- after all, all those soldiers had to have someplace to hang their civilian hats and VA loans were plentiful.  Me at about 2 in front of our house -- blue roof, blue shuttersThe same house in about 1985 -- light green roof, no shutters I do remember moving day, however.  There was an \"event\" and I remember it vividly although it was a fleeting moment.  We had two bedrooms in the new house and my mother set me on the floor in the \"back\" bedroom as they moved in a large plate glass mirror.  Whoever was doing the moving -- I have no idea who it was - leaned the mirror against the largest wall and left.Obviously not the same mirror but a close approximation I don't know if there was some movement or vibration or if they just hadn't been careful when placing it in the room but the mirror slid neatly onto the floor and shattered into a million pieces.  It must have sounded like a bomb going off because I distinctly remember my mother running into the room yelling \"my beautiful baby\" as I sat in a sea of broken glass.  I don't remember crying but my mother was terrified that I had been injured by the flying glass.  I wasn't.  Not a scratch.  I think I was a bit bewildered because things happened very quickly but I was fine.  I think, however, that was my mother's first step to becoming a very nervous woman.I have one other memory that is quite vivid.  This is the one that my co-worker disputed but I know better.  The front bedroom of the house was my parents room.  It was about 12 by 12 with two windows and a very small closet.  These houses were very well built and servicable but very plain -- no grand mouldings or trims of any sort -- generic, common baseboards and door facings (although all the interior doors were panelled doors with faceted glass doorknobs) and everything was pretty much painted white.  My crib was in my parents room.  I remember their bed was on the large wall that was also the living room wall and my crib was in front of the window.  My mother always kept the venetian blinds at a tilt to let in a bit of light and my mental vision of this particular memory is swathed in a milky blue light that you would associate with, perhaps, early morning.  I had a bottle, it seems, and I remember holding my mother's hand through the slats on my crib.  I remember feeling happy and content and I remember loving my mother.Me in my crib -- sorry for the state of the photo -- my pics have led a hard lifeMany things have happened to me in my life -- mostly good, nothing horrible just normal life \"things\" -- some I remember well, some memories are vague but these two memories have always been with me and are strong in my mind.  The mirror incident doesn't incite anxiety in me but rather a feeling that it is incredible that I wasn't hurt.  The hand-holding memory I hold dear.  Whenever I think about my mother my thoughts invariably go back to this memory. So, I have to ask, what is your earliest memory?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, February 04, 2015", "text": "The House Girl by Tara ConklinMy latest reading finish is The House Girl by Tara Conklin.  It is, again, two stories -- one historical and one contemporary -- running side by side and overlapping in a very interesting way.It is the story of Lina, a young lawyer.  She lives in NYC with her eccentric artist father.  Her mother died when she was four -- or did she?  Her life began anew when she left her job and made the call.It is the story of Josephine, a house girl on a dwindling plantation.  She had her first child at 13 -- it died -- or did it?  Even though she had lived on this plantation her entire life and knew nothing else she was determined to run -- twice.  Her life ended at 17.As someone who enjoys delving into family history, this was right up my alley.  However, I have recently read several books on the Civil War era and decided, after reading one particularly brutal book, I wasn't going to read anymore.  This one wasn't quite as extreme but enough to make me very uncomfortable.  However, in spite of that, it is a cleverly interlaced storyline that was engaging.  The only thing that I would change is that the author brought closing to Josephine's story where she left Lina's story quite open ended.  The reader can only assume the next leg in Lina's journey and I would have liked a little more info there.  Or a sequel.I would recommend this book if you like reading historical fiction and you like plots that twist and turn."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, January 28, 2015", "text": "Sarah, Plain and TallI went to the library yesterday with La Bean and as she was looking around for something new to read (I think she has read the entire children's section of the libary) I meandered over to the award winner section -- Newbery, Caldicott, Bluebonnet award winners.  I was looking for something to read for my Newbery Challenge.  I have several books in my own library that are award winners -- Strawberry Girl, comes to mind -- but I wanted something different.  I immediately picked up on \"Sarah, Plain and Tall\" by Patricia MacLachlan. I had read this book as a child and have seen the movie several times.  I thought Glenn Close made a good Sarah but I never thought Christopher Walked did Jacob any service at all.  Whoa, wait, this is turning into a movie review!  No, no and no.At any rate -- I got the book yesterday and as Bean (under the weather a bit) curled up into her reading chair and commenced to devour her library books, I curled up on the couch (also under the weather) to take a large bite out of mine.  It is a truly short read so it didn't take long.  It was as delightful as I remembered as a child and I enjoyed it.  So, I would recommend it for yourself or to read to a child although the subject matter would probably appeal to a child old enough to read it to his/herself.  I might buy a copy for my own library.Orphan TrainI promised a review of Orphan Train after I finished it.  Well, I have finished it and it left me so profoundly moved.  I honestly did not know of the concept of the orphan trains in the 20's and 30's so when I read this book and learned about them it certainly piqued my genealogical interest.  The story is good -- in the manner of telling two parallel stories of different time periods so popular today. Anything I say will truly be a spoiler so I am going to reserve my urge to give a synopsis.  I am just going to say to read it if you enjoy reading  history, especially of this country, and reading of the human condition.  There are so many levels on which to relate. Definite recommend."},

Then, I dosed myself up with Benadryl.Today I am appropriately ill.  Some of the symptoms have subsided but I cannot breath through my nose.  I have been sitting here with warm compresses on my face and having a huge problem trying to eat.  It is impossible to eat when you have to breathe through your mouth.  So, hot tea, hot compresses, saline spray and the decision to not venture from my chair is my approach to dealing with it. I have put on chicken for soup which we will have later and I am just binge watching \"Call the Midwife\" and playing Animal Crossing New Leaf.  I am avoiding the Benadryl.I will be better in a day or two."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, January 19, 2015", "text": "It's Monday! What Are You Reading?  19 January 2015Yes, it is Monday and I hope it is going to be as lovely as the weekend was -- nothing quite like spring in January but then, this is Texas so that isn't so unusual.This Monday I am finishing up \"Orphan Train\" by Christina Baker Kline.  I ran across it at B&N and couldn't leave without it.  I am not usually that way with books -- even if it sounds interesting I usually have my wits about me enough to try to procure the book in some manner rather than paying $25 for a brand new, hardcover edition. My resolve just dissolved when I read the dust jacket synopsis and I didn't flinch at bringing it home at full price. I started reading it in the car on the way home.  I couldn't put it down.  I almost finished it in a day.  I set it aside for the weekend because I didn't want it to end.  However, I will finish it today but before I do let me recommend this to anybody who enjoys historical fiction (based on fact) and who enjoys books about the human condition.This is a story of Molly, a troubled 17 year old who was caught stealing a library book and sentenced to 50 hours of community service.  She has been in and out of foster care for sometime and is just about to reach the age to be out of the system.  She is growing and maturing and the author communicates those changes and thought processes well.  She is to do her community service with an elderly lady named Vivian.  Vivian is quite well off yet quite alone and needs help going through boxes in her attic.  Molly isn't sure if she can endure 50 hours of that but as the story progresses she has to write a paper on some life journey and she thinks that Vivian's story might just work so she sets about interviewing her.  As they go through the boxes of stored items (which are clearly never going into the trash of any kind), Vivian's story unfolds.  Molly learns of Vivian's life at home, her immigration from Ireland,  how she  lost her family and ended up on one of the orphan trains that were used in the 1920's and 30's to find homes for orphaned children.  She learned of the hardships and dangers that a 9 year old Vivian -- aka Dorothy -- aka Niamh had to face and how these children, in large part, were adopted for labor and not for love.  While it is not hugely graphic it is a terrifying look at the lives of these children and the cruelty of the system.  As the book progresses, Molly takes it upon herself to do a bit of genealogical research at the library and makes a wonderful yet sad discovery -- don't worry -- I won't share -- you will have to read the book to find out what it is.  Up to this point she hasn't shared that discovery with Vivian.  I wonder if she ever will?At any rate, it is like this book was written for me.  Part of it was set in the time period of my parent's youths which give me a glimpse into the times of their childhoods.  It most certainly appeals to my genealogical sensibilities and make me want to go farther with the research than Molly did.  It is a completely engaging book that I really hate to see end. As I finish the book today I will let you know if the end fulfills my expectations.  I have a feeling I am going to shed a couple of tears -- for Molly?  for Vivian?  for all the children of that time who were treated as a commodity and not nurtured for the gifts they were?  Probably all of it. More later."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, January 14, 2015", "text": "Aunt Dimity and the Next of KinI haven't read an Aunt Dimity book in more than a year so I decided to start out the year with one plus it will apply to several challenges that I am participating in.  I have loved Aunt Dimity since the first one I ever read but I have to say that this one fell a little flat.  I don't know why except that I have been reading a lot of Agatha Raisin and Agatha is a lot feistier than Lori Shepherd and maybe I was expecting it to be livelier.With that said, however, the setting was great, the story was good, I felt like the conclusion seemed to be very \"Murder She Wrote\".  I did enjoy it and will continue to work toward completing the series -- maybe I have just been away from the books too long. I do recommend the book as well as the entire series.  They are great little reads."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, January 12, 2015", "text": "Calm in the Chaos or Tidying the UntidyableMy friend, Mary, has been challenging herself to tidy one messy place at a time.  I was inspired by her and tackled my very own, personal, messy spot.  It is the table beside my chair where I live.  Now, I am not one to ever have a \"model home\" that looks like nobody lives there -- I have to have my \"stuff\" close at hand.  That doesn't mean it needs to look like a bomb went off or that the house had been ransacked.  So, here are my before and after photos.  I am almost ashamed to show them but...ok, here goes. What a mess -- mail, sewing stuff, opps- candy wrappers, cups, Bean drawing -- yep, a hot mess.After the clearing up.  My coaster that my daughter made because I always have a cup or glass.  My current reading stack including a notebook to make notes in.  When I sit here and do family history searching, I am always making notes so a notepad is essential.  The little container with pens and pencils in it was a gift to my father while he was undergoing radiation treatments.  There was a older couple there with the husband going through treatments as well and the wife did ceramics and threw pottery.  After learning that my father was an artist, she did this little pencil holder for him.  I treasure it because it meant a lot to him.  I put it here because I am always looking for a pencil or pen and can never find one so I am trying to be organized.  Also, the phone and a pin cushion that opens and holds my rosary and some handmade lotion.Rhonda from Down to Earth has posed a challenge to tidy up the pantry.  I have taken a \"before\" photo and will take an \"after\" when, and if, there ever is an \"after\".  There needs to be because some very clumsy person (me) spilled a whole bunch of flour in there and, even though I initially cleaned it up, I still keep finding it.  So, we will see what it looks like when I get done.  However, until there is an \"after\" nobody is seeing a photo of the \"before\".  I'm just sayin'.Yes, indeed, it is Monday.  It started out with a brisk wind but lots of sunshine.  It has now dissolved into a strong, cold wind and absolutely no sunshine -- just lots of clouds.  I am glad I did my grocery shopping early so I can just close myself up and cook/read/play video games -- yes, I play video games.  Supposed to keep the mind alert -- whatever.Anyway, back to what I am reading. I am currently reading the next title in my Aunt Dimity queue -- \"Aunt Dimity and the Next of Kin\".  I am about half way done and there is no \"next of kin\" surfacing as of yet. I am on several mystery series challenges and a \"finish the series\" challenge -- at this rate, that one is going to be a dismal disappointment.However, after looking at my daily blog reads, I see where JLSHall (http://jlshall.blogspot.com) has listed a current finish -- \"The Red House Mystery\" by A. A. Milne.  It looks good and so I purchased a copy for my e-reader.  I seem to read so much faster on an e-reader which aggravates me because I really, really like books.  However, I guess it is ok since I have pretty much run out of room for books and would prefer to frequent the library anyway -- or the used book store or the e-reader offerings.  So, I think that will be my next read when I finish the Aunt Dimity book.So, off to make some more scones.  Some chocolate chip ones without nuts and some apricot walnut ones for Hubs.  He loves apricots and these scones have very little sugar in them -- enough -- but not enough that it annoys his diabetes -- he can actually eat them.  So....maybe there will be photos later along with my DIY Restaurant Dinner #3."},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, January 11, 2015", "text": "My Sunday In PhotosMy church homeIf you would like to see interior photos please go to www.stjohnsfortworth.comSmall garden off the Parish Hall   Coffee hour between services in Mitchell HallLunch  Hubs favorite Sunday evening programMy favorite Sunday evening programMy DIY restaurant meal tonight was grilled cheese sandwiches with potato leek   soup and left over cole slaw.  I tried a new brand of organic soup and the Hubs didn't like it so I guess I will have to dig up the recipe I have used before and make it myself.  It wasn't difficult, if I remember correctly, but not nearly as easy as popping the top on a container.  Oh well, I will just make it a day ahead and reheat.  Most things are better the next day anyway, right?So, when we get done with our tv viewing for the evening, I will be retiring with my current read -- Aunt Dimity and the Next of Kin.  I hope your day was as good as mine!Restaurant Fare Replication #1In yesterdays blog post I was lamenting the daily exercise of cooking dinner.  It is clearly not one of my talents.  I did some thinking about why that is and came up with the idea that when I cook a meal, I mentally go back to my junior high school home economics class (gotta love Mrs. Chappell)  and try to make meals according to the 1962 plan.  It is a good plan -- meat, a starch, two vegetables, fruit and a piece of bread.  It was very balanced and I am sure very good for you if the meal is prepared well.  However, that is not how the Hubs and I REALLY eat.  So, every evening when I try to prepare the 1962 preferred dinner, my husband just sort of pushes it around on his plate, eats about a third of it and says he is full and leaves.  Now, either it is too much food, he doesn't like my cooking, he is tired of chicken or it just isn't the restaurant food his palate has become accustomed to.  So, in an attempt to make the whole thing a bit more pleasant for both of us, I decided to give making restaurant meals at home a try.  I don't mean take-out -- just meals I cook that are basically what we get when we are out.  Here is my first attempt.We regularly stop at Church's Fried Chicken and grab some chicken strips and sides.  Do we love fried chicken?  Not really.  It is just a convenient stop on the way home from babysitting.  By that time of day we are tired and way past hungry so the chicken, being the sheer comfort food that it is, is just a handy thing to get.Here is my meal -- the chicken is breaded in flour, egg and panko crumbs, drizzled with a bit of oil and baked in the oven.  The potato is a recipe I found on pinterest.  You thinly slice a baking potato, without cutting through the bottom, drizzled olive oil on it and sprinkle it with whatever seasoning you like.  The idea is that it will come out with little slices that you pull off that are crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  I included these potatoes because I don't like making or eating french fries (my husbands preference) -- I am a mashed potato kind of gal -- so I thought this would sort of satisfy both of us.  I have to say it didn't work well.  They didn't get done enough even after doubling the cooking time. I think my potatoes were too big and we could have done with just one and shared it.  Anyway, I will give it another try another time.  The cole slaw is a recipe from the Frugal Gourmet cookbook.  It is called One Week Coleslaw.  It is really good and makes enough to have again during the week.  It lasts a long time, hence the name. I have been making this recipe for years and it is my go-to cole slaw recipe.Then, I decided to try my hand at scone making. I routinely buy them, either plain or apple, at a local grocery store but after eating those made by our assistant rector's wife, I knew there was something better out there.  So, I found a recipe that I had pinned to my pinterest board and went to work.  I was really surprised at how easy they were -- I was expecting something very complicated.  The recipe had a few variations with it but I didn't have any dried cranberries and I didn't want to add currants so I threw in about a third of a cup of chopped walnuts and mini chocolate chips.  This was the finished product.  What do you think?  My first attempt and they still better than the grocery store variety. The tea is Household Blend from Fortnum and Mason, a gift from my daughter.  The tea towel is from a friend.So, I added this menu, with the notes about the potatoes, to my household notebook.  I am not sure what I will have today -- maybe soup and grilled cheese - but whatever it is, I am eating out of the pantry and freezer for a few days this week before I head to the store.  Things are piling up and need to be used so our meals could be a bit creative.  At any rate, I think it is time for me to get Mrs. Chappell out of my head and move on to real life meal planning.The next thing on my list to try is Tres Leche cake. Tres Leche cake (three milks) is a traditional Mexican cake which is so good that you just know you shouldn't be eating it.  It is made up of a sponge cake that has been soaked in sweetened condensed milk (Eagle Brand), evaporated milk (Pet or Carnation) and whipping cream.  It is generally served with fruit and whipped cream.  It is about a gazillion calories per square inch and absolutely wonderful.  We go to a local restaurant that has lovely food and this cake.  A slice, to share between us, costs about $9 and I think that is sort of ridiculous.  So, I am going to try my hand at it.  There is a good recipe by Ree Drummond of Pioneer Woman.  I need  to make this when I have company though because there will be way to much and I. Will, Eat. It. All.  That can't happen so I will wait for guinea pigs at my table.So, that is how the first DIY restaurant meal turned out.  The Hubs didn't complain, he ate most of it, and that was a good thing.  Another instalment soon."},

It is cold.  How about joining me in a nice cup of something warm, sit here by the fire and have a nice chat.  I generally start out my mornings this way -- cup of tea on the table and the computer on my lap.  This is my \"quiet\" time, my time to communicate with my friends, read my favorite blogs, mull over my day.  Just sort of get myself together.I was reading one of my regular, and favorite, blogs this a.m. --Joysweb (joysweb.blogspot.com).  Joy is my first cousin, we were raised in close proximity and spent a lot of time together as youngsters so it stands to reason that we have a lot of the same things in common.  I was reading her latest post this morning and I have to say the one thing we didn't do alike was journaling.  She has always been a diarist, as was her mother -- my aunt and \"other\" mother.  I am sure Joy has numerous books outlining her life from childhood until now. I would love to read them, to see our childhoods through her eyes, to see if we remembered the same things the same way.  I am sure that will never happen but, having the genealogy interest that I do, I am sure her stash is priceless. She did try to get me interested in keeping a diary when I was a child.  This was my first diary and, if my memory serves me correctly, it came from her as a gift.I still have it and there are a number of entries -- mostly about the love of my life, my elementary school boyfriend who shall remain nameless.  I am sure he doesn't even remember my name, much less read blogs, but if he sees himself here, well, so be it.  However, I just wasn't disciplined enough to keep a diary -- my nose was always in a book and I guess I just didn't have time to write one of my own. Oh, I wish I had, though, but that would be getting into the question of 20/20 hindsight, now wouldn't it?  I will say that my mother was against diary keeping -- she said that lots of things shouldn't be written down and I guess her negativity was instrumental in my lack of discipline. I guess my meager attempts at a diary will have to serve for future generations to get a glimpse of my childhood -- hahah! And my blog will have to serve as my adult diary. I have spent an inordinate amount of time the last couple of days googling \"fashion for the frugal, mature woman\".  I am not a fashionista and, according to most of these websites, I do everything wrong.  According to who?  I regularly read \"Advanced Style\" which I find to be comical and garish, sometimes.  However, it does leave you with the idea that if you like it, it is ok and maybe somebody on the street will take your photo. Obviously these women of Advanced Style live in much more fashionable places than I do and they have much more expendable income.  So I have been looking at what I, the older, rather round, American woman living in mid-sized college town and babysitter of 4 year old should be wearing.  And do you know what I found out?  Absolutely nothing.  I found out that I shouldn't be wearing pants with elastic waists (WHAAAT?) and I shouldn't be wearing muumuu's (they still make those?).  I discovered Normcore -- also known as Walmart chic -- which really tends to define me a little more closely. Normcore is dressing in basic colors with no identifying marks (i.e. designer labels) so you blend in. Yes, Normcore sounds a LOT like me so I guess I am ok there.  Skinny jeans are ok (ROFL) and I really shouldn't wear beige/khaki flats (well, there goes one of my two favorite pairs of shoes).  Makeup for the older lady should be non-existent but, if it is worn, it should be as colorless as possible (read: no blue eye shadow) -- everything should be matte earth tones (what? no blue eyeshadow? I don't understand.). I must be careful with blush in the sea of blah as I don't want to look clownish.  It is ok to have grey hair (thank goodness) and wearing it in a mid-length bob is preferable.  At least I got one thing right.  I decided I wasn't getting anywhere with the clothes so I would look at appropriate jewelry.  One site says tasteful, meaningful, GOOD jewelry that you wear habitually.  Another site says costume, statement jewelry.  My Aunt Linnie, who was the most glamorous person I have ever known, wore the same pieces of GOOD jewelry as far back as I can remember so that is my paradigm and I am going with that.  In essence, after a day and a half of looking at numerous websites on appropriate, mature dressing, I came back with nuthin'.  So, I guess I will just continue with my elastic waist jeans (much to my daughter's horror), my button down shirts, my flats  and my Pandora bracelet with charms depicting my ancestry.  However, I did come back with one piece of valuable knowledge -- leggings aren't pants.  For anybody.  And beige leggings worn as pants should be outlawed.  Not. A. Pretty. Picture. I guess I did learn, as well, that \"advanced style\" can really be anything you want it to be as long as you like it and are comfortable.  The only prerequisite is the \"advanced\" part.Then, last night, I realized how really dysfunctional I am in the kitchen.  I have been married for 42 years and have been cooking for all those years and I still can't get it right.  Either I don't have all the ingredients or something has gone out of date or, the worst thing, it isn't defrosted.  I can't seem to have a meaningful relationship with a crockpot -- my husband really doesn't like food out of a crockpot (especially boneless/skinless chicken breasts).  So, last night sitting at LaMadeleine (after realizing the the sausages we were having for dinner were outdated) listening to my husband grouse about how they had taken his favorite salad off the menu it dawned on me what I am doing wrong.  Instead of cooking the dinners that my mother cooked (time consuming, labor intensive affairs), I need to be cooking what we really eat -- restaurant fare.  Fast Mexican food comes to mind -- in Texas we had Mexican food every Wednesday in the school cafeteria and all of us still think \"it's Wednesday, it must be Mexican\" so I should start there.  I asked about his favorite salad which is Roasted Pear and Proscuitto on Field Greens with toasted pecans.  I think I can replicate that.  Maybe with balsamic dressing.  I am sure we can make Friday either sandwich or pizza night.  I think I had an epiphany! I just need to make restaurant food in my kitchen! How do you think that sounds?  Maybe with a bit of effort and thought (not too much though) I could make it healthier.  Hmmm....sounds like some listmaking for me today.Well, I have finished my second cup of tea and I hear the washer calling my name.  So, I guess it is time to get our days started.  Thanks for having tea with me -- next time maybe there will be a treat to share -- maybe a project to share. So, until next time -- have a great Saturday."},

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, January 07, 2015", "text": "I Love Picture Books 2015I love this challenge.  I love childrens books.  I love picture books mostly because I like the art.  This is going to be very easy for me because I babysit my 4 year old granddaughter and we read all the time.  Many of these books come from her stash.In the last couple of days I have read one of her favorites from the library which is now in her personal library as it was a Christmas gift from us and then one from her parents as a Christmas gift.The first book that I read was \"Anatole\" by Eve Titus.It is the story of a very enterprising mouse with a family to care for and how he did well for himself.  It is an ingenious little plot, a bit different than I have read before, and it was enjoyable.  I recommend.The second is \"High Street\" by Alice Melvin.This is the story of a little girl, Sally, with a shopping list who goes to High Street to make her purchases.  The art work is lovely and each time she gets to a shop on High Street, a page opens so that you can see the inside of the shop.  It is really cute and interactive and there are so many things to see in the shops! This book is quintessentially British and is the third book by British children's author Alice Melvin.  I haven't read the other two but reviews say they are delightful as well. My granddaughter has a British father so she is exposed to lots of British children's literature (\"The Gruffalo\" comes to mind immediately) which, I feel, accounts for her rather extensive vocabulary and her hybrid accent.  Have you ever heard a British/Texas accent?  She can make \"y'all\" sound posh.  I digress.Anyway, if you are in the market for picture books to read for yourself, a child, or to collect, I would recommend these as they are very entertaining, even for the adults."},

He was born where the imaginary friends are born but it takes him a while to find his person -- or his person to find him.  He is adorable, he is little and he is brave and courageous.  He finally finds his person in the form of a little girl named Alice.  They know from the beginning they belong together.  It is a beautiful story.My granddaughter received this book for Christmas from her uncle, aunt and cousins.  It is one of her new old favorites and I would recommend it. The Giver by Lois LowryI just finished my first book of the new year -- for the Newbery reading challenge.  I chose \"The Giver\" by Lois Lowry.  It is a children's dystopian novel.  It is my understanding that this book is given to youngsters in approximately the 5th grade to read.  I have never believed in book banning and I don't believe in censorship -- I never really stopped my children from reading whatever they wanted but if a teacher told me that my 5th grader was required to read this book, I would be challenging the teacher for sure.  At age 11, I would not have been able to handle this -- no wonder a large proportion of our children are depressed if this is what they are reading.I have read adult dystopian novels like \"Anthem\" and \"The Handmaid's Tale\" -- even \"The Lottery\" and they have always been disturbing and depressing.  I was hoping this one would be different.  While it had a relatively positive ending it was just yucky - well written but yucky. If a person was looking for this type of book, I would recommend it -- it is well written but for me -- I am moving on to my next Aunt Dimity novel."},
{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, January 01, 2015", "text": "Riedel FascinationI have signed up for two more challenges hosted by Carolyn at Riedel Fascination (cmriedel.wordpress.com).The first is titled My Kind of Mystery which I already mentioned in a previous blog.I am joining at the Secret Message level.The second challenge hosted by Carolyn is \"Ethereal - 2015\". I don't know how well I will do with this challenge as this isn't my usual go-to genre but I am going to give it a go.  I am starting at the intuition level.Carolyn asks that we write a blog post stating why we want to join her challenges.  I don't know that I have an answer for that except that I like having goals.  Plus, I really like the artwork on the buttons.  Not very different from me judging books by their covers.  I am shallow, what can I say.So, yes, now I am done joining challenges.  I think I have enough to keep me busy and I guess I should quit blogging and start reading!HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!Yes, I am a bit late with the midnight felicitations but at midnight I was sawing logs.  I no longer stay up on New Years Eve.  After years of doing that and feeling pretty sleep deprived the next day, I realized that the New Year looked a lot rosier with some sleep.  So, I retired around 8:30 p.m. with the first book of my 2015 challenges and was down for the count a little after 9 p.m.Another thing I no longer do is make resolutions.  I try to review the prior year and make note of what went well and what didn't. If something worked out I will continue but if it didn't I will see how to tweak it to make it better -- or discard it altogether. A few of the things I will be doing this year are:Maintaining a healthy eating plan.  Not a diet, mind you, but eating for good health.  The healthy eating plan went well (until Thanksgiving/Christmas -- opps) and I will continue to practice what I worked out to be a good fit for me.  This requires eating at home more so I need to work on some new recipes. Exercising more -- I don't like to exercise so I have been trying to work out a non-exercise routine which, obviously, means walking more.  I will be wearing my pedometer every day and keeping closer tabs on my steps.  I might throw in a hula hoop but, for today, I am sitting out with a gimpy knee -- I have learned to rest through a problem rather than just continue and make it worse.  I don't know what I have done to my knee but it isn't good so I am resting.Evaluate my crafting life.  I do like to make things.  I have pretty much fallen out of love with quilting for a variety of reasons -- mostly because I don't have room to spread things out and it becomes so challenging that I don't really enjoy it anymore.  I might try some of the quilt as you go techniques but for now, it is going to the bottom of my list.  I do like to cross stitch and have challenged myself to starting a project -- one project -- a month and finishing it.  It will have to be small but that is ok.  Anything to get me back in the habit of stitching.Teaching myself to loom knit.  I have tried traditional knitting and my brain clearly doesn't roll that way.  I do, however, have a set of knitting looms and I am going to try my hand at it.  My goal is to knit dish clothes.  How hard could that be?  For me -- probably quite difficult but we will see.Continuing my reading challenges.  This year I have signed up for so many reading challenges but most of them overlap to some extent so it should be good.  I have already started my first book for the Newbery Challenge. I chose \"The Giver\" by Lois Lowry.  I have read one of her books before and enjoyed it so I am hoping this one goes well.  It is a dystopian novel and those sort of tend to freak me out but so far it is ok.  I will review here.So, I know that doesn't sound like much but it is enough for me.  There aren't too many changes I would make to my life -- I like calm and quiet and I pretty much have that.  I value good health and so far so good.  I like being busy but I have learned to appreciate and embrace relaxation and time spent just doing nothing.  It is all about balance and I guess that would be my goal for the new year -- good balance.So, on that note -- have a wonderful New Year's Day, stay safe and warm and join me back here anytime for a bit of a chat."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, December 29, 2014", "text": "Well, we have come to the end of this meme for the year.  I haven't participated each week but hopefully that will be different in the upcoming year because this is a great site to be introduced to new books.This week I am reading \"Rosengren's Books:  An Oasis of Mind and Spirit\" written by Mary Carolyn Hollers George.  It is a non-fictional work about a bookstore in San Antonio, Texas that was founded by Frank Rosengren.  This bookstore was a intellectual haven for authors such as Robert Frost and Bennett Cerf and a whole host of others.  It was a \"hang-out\" for the local intellectual crowd as well and had the ambience of a well used, well worn personal library.  This book was of personal interest to me because my father was a friend of the family.  I already knew a lot of the history of the family but this just adds more.  I always felt that they were an interesting lot but I had no idea -- I wish I could go back and talk to Figgi as an adult -- I am sure he had many more stories to tell. One of the fascinating things about this book, other than the subject matter, are the vintage photos.  Especially interesting to me, obviously, are the ones of  San Antonio.  Being a native of SA, I have always been interested in local history and the local characters.  This is one of the more interesting families.Moving on through the next few days, I will be organizing some of the books for my challenges.  Last year I only did one challenge and that was fun but this year I have signed up for several more and am looking forward to getting started.  I have already decided on my book for the Newbery Challenge -- The Giver.  It is poised and ready to go.  Will be looking for my next Aunt Dimity book and my next Agatha Raisin book.  I think I will have to order my next Elm Creek series book as I can't seem to find it in any bookstore.  So, that is my plan for the next few days -- I wish I could get my house as organized as my reading plan!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, December 27, 2014", "text": "Reading ChallengesI have signed up for five reading challenges in addition to the 2015 Goodreads Reading Challenge.  I have added the buttons to the sidebar and I will be listing my books there.  Obviously these are going to overlap because I do have to spend time doing other things like eating and sleeping -- well, ok, maybe not so much eating.The Cloak and Dagger Challenge will find me beginning with 5 books -- the Inpector Lestrade level.  Considering that I am really enjoying mysteries these days (something I never thought I would ) I think this should be do-able.Cruisin Thru the Cozies Reading Challenge is going to be fun.  I am deeply entrenched in two cozy mystery series and plan to continue with each of those.  I am starting with Level 1--Snoop -- goal is 6 books.  I don't think this will be a problem!I think this will work nicely with the next challenge --This series I am going to use to finish the Elm Creek series as well as the Aunt Dimity series and the Agatha Raisin series.  Sounds like a lofty goal and I might not make it but who knows -- if we actually get snow and ice I won't have anything else to do.  The only problem with this is, I am really enjoying these series and I don't want to rush them because I have separation anxiety issues when I finish a book I really enjoy!The next challenge is the Newbery Reading Challenge.  When I was in elementary school, we received a reading list each year from which we were to choose books and write book reports.  Many of these books were Newbery or Caldecott winners.  I loved most of them and I have some of them in my personal library.  Obviously some of these will be re-reads but I think that is ok.  I don't think there is a limit on how many books we can read however there is a point system for the number of books you read. I am going to begin with the L'Engle level which is 15-29 points and I will see how it goes. I am going to try to find copies of some of the early Newbery winners -- however, actually acquiring them is a bit cost prohibitive if you try to find those from the 1920's!I also signed up for the I Love Picture Books 2015 Challenge hosted by Gina at The Book Dragon's Lair.  I routinely read to a four year old.  This is a no brainer.  Easy peasy.  Plus, I love picture books. All of the book on these challenges will be included in my 2015 Goodreads Reading Challenge.  I haven't put up a button, though, because there doesn't seem to be one yet.  I will probably leave my goal at 20 books for that challenge as that seems to be a do-able number for me.So, that is my reading goal for this year.  It sounds overwhelming but I think it will be ok.  I am doing a lot of reading on my Nook glo-light and I find that I read faster when I use it.  I have read that people who use e-readers don't retain the information as well but I don't find that to be true -- I have gotten a lot less resistant to using an e-reader as heavy books really hurt my hands to hold.  Plus, there is just something about that instant gratification of being able to push a button and voila! there is the book you just couldn't wait to read. So, happy reading for 2015! Getting Ready for the New YearIt seems that 2014 is going to go out with a crunch ---  possibly that of ice underfoot.  We have had reasonably nice weather for the Christmas holiday, so far.  It has been gloomy enough to look like winter yet mild enough to go without coats.  However, it appears that may be coming to an end.  We watch one specific weather report every night and I have absolutely no faith in one of the forecasters.  However, the head meteorologist is usually pretty good and when he says, several days out, that ice is a possiblity, even a small one, I tend to listen and make sure I have certain necessities in the house.  So, after the events of this weekend, I will be heading out to make sure I have those necessities -- bathroom tissue, milk and chili.  Everything a person needs for the duration.I will also be spending some time re-doing my blog.  I have signed up for several reading challenges for the upcoming year.  Yes, I know, I said I wasn't going to do that but they ARE fun and they do keep me reading and they do give me goals throughout the year.  I am finding that as I get older, if I don't have a goal things just tend to not get done.  I am not particularly bothered by that -- I have spent a good many years \"getting things done\" so if something slides I don't get my knickers in a twist about it.  However, there is something fulfilling about ticking things off a list.I might actually create a monthly cross stitch challenge for myself.  I do like to cross stitch and it is coming easier for me these days than quilting.  For instance, I have quilted myself into a very sore and swollen wrist right now and that was doing it on a machine! Sometimes I think machine quilting is much harder than hand quilting but I digress.  In any event, I might be putting something up about a personal cross stitch challenge.I need to re-do the side bar of the blog to reflect my reading progress in all of these challenges.  If it is there, in front of me, I will remember it and pay attention.  If I jot it down in some obscure place, like a little notebook, it will be lost forever and sometime down the road, when I do remember it, I will be playing catch up and that just never works well. I think I will leave the 2014 Reading Challenge list up there at least until New Year's Eve.  I might leave it period.  That way I can see clearly what I have already read without having to go to Goodreads and look it up.  Goodreads and I don't seem to play nice.So, that is my goal for the blog this year.  I think I will keep the same design because I really like sharing my own photos and I like changing the colors around.  I have one of those little flag holders outside my house and I like to change the flag each month to celebrate something special for that month -- every month has something special.  That is sort of how I view my blog header -- changing it up every month.  Who knows, maybe that is where I will display the ongoing cross stitch challenge.  We will see.Well, time to go work on the baby quilt.  I will post photos when I am done.Have a wonderful Saturday!"},

However, I have spent the last couple of hours (3 to be exact) trying to get this tree decorated.  A couple of years ago we purchased a new tree that is really tall (exciting for a short one like me) and narrow -- fits in the corner really well.  But......it looks like I stood back and threw the ornaments at the middle.  It is tall, I am not, there isn't much up there.  I can't bend down well because of gimpy knees so there isn't much low so -- yeah, the middle looks - crowded.It is all my daughter's fault.  She always loved decorating the tree --to the point that she was so OCD about it nobody helped her -- we all just left her to it and it always turned out fine.  She got married.  She moved. Now she has her own tree to do and has left me to my own devices.It is not pretty.I found myself googling \"how to decorate a Christmas tree\".  Really?  How sad.  There has got to be a formula to this.  I wonder if there is a \"Christmas Tree Decorating for Dummies\" book out there? Ok, enough of the rant.  Back to the project -- hopefully it will be done before bedtime!Agatha Raisin and the Terrible TouristI just finished reading this title in the Agatha Raisin series and I have to say it wasn't my favorite.  Now, I didn't dislike it enough to give up on it  but I didn't like it as much as I have the others.  I don't know if it was the setting or what but it seemed like there wasn't as much plot and an awful lot of driving around North Cyprus.  At any rate, I will still recommend the series and they are really fun to read and I hope that the next one is better.  Maybe I just need a break and should go back and read one of the Nancy Atherton Aunt Dimity series. Or, maybe I should read \"Animal Farm\" -- my daughter is reading it for her class right now and I have never read it so maybe I will give it a go.  I still need a couple of books to meet my 2014 Reading Challenge so I need some small books -- maybe children's books? I think I could just about manage two of those!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, December 07, 2014", "text": "Progressing --As we progress through this season of Advent I am aware that one of the things I love about the season is the tradition -- the things we do over and over again year after year.  There is peace in that tradition again bringing calm to the chaos -- closing out the world for just a little while as we allow ourselves to be caught up in the familiar routines and customs of the season. Once Thanksgiving is over, we try to do most of the decorating and rearranging before December 1st because with the first Sunday in Advent we try to take a quiet approach to our days.  It doesn't always work, sometimes we are caught up in the excitement of the season but we try. We generally do our Advent lessons on Sunday.  Our granddaughter participates with us as we light the candles and have our devotion.  This year we have started doing something different.  I purchased a small nativity where everything is detached and able to be set out individually.  I also purchased a small stable.  So, prior to the first Sunday I set out the stable and on the first Sunday, after devotion, we set out Mary and Joseph.  Tonight we added the angel.  This little set is so cute and sweet and is just the right size for this sort of activity.We also added the second candle to our Advent wreath.  When my children were little I had a children's wreath but the candles were an odd size and hard to find so I finally replaced it with the one I am using now.  Again, this is a tradition we have done for years now and I look forward to it every year. So, while we move on toward Christmas, progressing through the remainder of the year and looking forward to a new year I am struck by the sameness of the rituals -- looking forward to the new and yet loving the security of the old. I hope you had a wonderful Second Sunday in Advent. NativitiesLast year while browsing through a gift shop in North Richland Hills -- Apple Annie's -- I just caught this little nativity in the corner of my eye and knew I had to have it.  It is just the sweetest thing.The same thing happened to me this morning at church.  Our church is in a historic neighborhood full of gorgeous old houses (stjohnsfortworth.com).  Each year in early December the neighborhood hosts a tour of homes and our church, being the gorgeous building that it is and being that it is in the middle of the neighborhood also hosts a tea room and a craft bazaar.  Today during coffee hour I had the opportunity to look at some of the offerings in the bazaar and  found the cutest little nativity.  It was only three pieces -- Mary, Joseph and Baby Jesus -- and it appeared to be carved from rock.  There were actually two of these sets -- one large one and one small one and I would have bought one of them on the spot but the bazaar hadn't begun yet and there was nobody there to buy it from.  The booth it was in was sponsored by a children's book store, Monkey and Dog, that is owned by a fellow parishioner.  I am planning on visiting her store later this week and if the little nativities are there I will be bringing one home with me.  I wish I had a picture to show you but I will share if I actually buy one of them.I really do enjoy collecting nativity sets -- I have several but they are all small or one piece and unique in some way.  I find that just looking at them brings peace to the chaos.   What do you collect to dress up the season?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, December 06, 2014", "text": "This and ThatI have been away for a few days because I have been busy avoiding all the things I need to do!  There is something in my personality that makes me just stop when things get hectic.  I have always been this way -- I tend to avoid chaos.  And that is what I have been busy doing.Yesterday was my son's birthday -- he turned 39! How in the world did that happen?  Oh well, at least he is the only one aging!I have been having fun waiting for the mailman these days.  I don't know about anybody else but shopping in actual brick-and-mortar stores is dismal -- they don't have a large variety of things and I guess a stockroom is a thing of the past.  So, I have done most of my shopping online.  I used to love Christmas shopping in stores, I loved the decoration and the displays but now I seem to get a kick out of the mailman coming around and leaving packages on my doorstep!  I am still waiting for one more thing to arrive and I will have received all my purchases and can set about wrapping things up and put them under the tree.Oh, wait -- I haven't put the tree up yet......reference paragraph #1.I have been playing with DIY dishwasher detergent.  I am forever on a quest to do things frugally with fewer chemicals in my house.  I will never buy commercial laundry soap again and I think I might have found an acceptable recipe for DIY dishwasher detergent.  It is 1 cup Borax, 1 cup Washing Soda, 1/2 c Kosher salt and 5 pkgs. of unsweetened Kool-aid lemonade mix (or you can use citric acid).  The first load I ran turned out really great except for a couple of things -- this stuff isn't ever going to get tea stains out of cups if it has sat for a while.  I didn't use a rinse agent.  With the second load I did use a rinse agent -- white vinegar.  I didn't put it in the rinse agent receptacle because it might corrode the rubber gaskets and things so I put it in a small glass in the top rack.  It worked really well but I have to say that to use this method, you really have to make sure that dishes are rinsed off before loading the dishwasher.  I know that sounds like a lot more work than it should be but the pay off is that you aren't overcome by chemical fumes when you open the door at the end of the cycle.  I will continue to use this until it is gone and then I will re-evaluate if I really like it.  I think I will but time will tell.I have been trying to keep up with the Christmas movie marathon but I keep falling asleep.  My favorite Christmas movie of all isn't really a Christmas movie but traditionally I watch it at Christmas -- \"The Bells of St. Mary's\" with Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman.  I began it last night and about 45 minutes into it I was snoozing quite well in my chair.  I really don't like it when that happens.  So, to update, I have watched PART of \"White Christmas\" (again with Bing Crosby) and PART of \"The Bells of St. Mary's\".  I have watched several things on the Hallmark Christmas channel but honestly, I can't remember the names of any of them.  I have watched \"You've Got Mail\" which is sort of Christmas-y and \"Love Actually\" which is definitely Christmas-y.  I am planning to watch \"Sleepless in Seattle\" and, of course, \"The Christmas Story\".  Hopefully I will catch \"Miracle on 34th Street\" and no way will I watch \"Home Alone\" -- that is the most painful movie I have ever seen.Unrelated to Christmas, I have really been enjoying \"Doc Martin\" and we are now beginning the final season and I am really going to miss it when I have completed the whole thing.  I have also started the series \"Call the Midwife\" which I am enjoying as well -- I really like Miranda Hart.  I cancelled my Hulu subscription and instead subscribed to Netflix streaming and I am really glad I did.  While I enjoyed \"The Rev\" and \"Coronation Street\" on Hulu I am finding a much bigger variety on Netflix.I am also continuing with the Agatha Raisin series.  I have really enjoyed all the books so far but I am not enjoying this one -- \"Agatha Raisin and the Terrible Tourist\" quite as much.  I don't know why but I am almost done so I can move on with the next one.  I really wish we were going to receive the new Agatha Raisin series here.And last, but not least, I have been working on a baby quilt for the new baby in the family.  It involves rabbits and stripes and I will show a photo when I get done with it which should be soon.  It is going to be a gift for her christening. So, that is what has been keeping me busy as I try to avoid the chaos.  I can't believe it is already the 6th -- this month and this year will be gone before we know it.  I remember when my father was waiting for the countdown to the new millenium -- and that has already been 14 years ago. Time is just flying by and I don't think I like it -- so, I am avoiding the chaos and trying to slow the pace and enjoy my days rather than just rushing through them -- I want this beautiful season to last a while, I want to savor it and all it has to offer."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, December 01, 2014", "text": "Bye-bye Thanksgiving!Today is December 1st! Advent has begun.  Thanksgiving 2014 is now a memory -- I would like to say distant but considering there is still leftover food in my refrigerator, not so much! I have to say that no matter how much pre-planning and paring down I do, Thanksgiving is the most exhausting of holidays -- more than Christmas.  I think it has to do with standing on my feet for hours cooking.  However, I am glad it is over and I am looking forward to the next month.I am about done with my shopping -- really doing precious little of it this year.  Opting for a simpler approach.  We have reached the point in our lives where our adult children really don't need much and whatever they do need, they have the means to supply themselves.  The children are all growing and settling into their own interests so the days of mass toys are drawing to a halt.  E is still new so all she needs is a cuddle which I will be glad to give in excess -- can't have too many hugs.  So, Christmas this year will be more of a celebration of time together, time to reflect on blessings and just a time to kick back and chill-- an appropriate word considering the 45 degree drop in temperature over night.As things wind down from a visit from my husband's sister and her husband on the occasion of my mother-in-law's  93rd birthday and, of course, the food frenzy known as Thanksgiving, I am enjoying some time to explore new DNA information on my Ancestry.com account.  When I did the DNA test I wasn't sure how that information would evolve and be used but it seems that it is an ongoing thing with new information being added all the time.  The DNA matches are becoming more specific which is fascinating.  When you have a DNA match the people at Ancestry have designed the results to compare your tree to the \"cousin's\" tree so you can see the relationship very clearly.  It is all very exciting and interesting, especially when most of my DNA matches are to the part of the family that was the most elusive.  I will be watching it quite closely to see more relatives.Speaking of relatives and roots and all that -- it is no surprise to anyone that I am of extreme British extraction -- I have hardly any other ancestry except some Dutch and a tiny bit of German.  I have always identified with my British self -- in spite of the fact that Ancestry DNA seems to concentrate on my Dutch ancestry.  I was quite close to my grandfather who was the son of Welsh immigrants and many of the things I still do hark back to his habits which were, of course, from his parents. However -- there is the question of tea.  I have always been a tea drinker.  I remember having tea and toast with the aforementioned grandfather -- more Pet milk than tea but tea and toast was sort of a ritual of ours.  That and the Welsh rarebit but that is another story.  You would think that I would have tea making down pat, wouldn't you.  Well, with a tea bag, yes, but my daughter brought me some lovely loose tea from Fortnum and Mason on her last time to England.  It is loose tea and really good.  However, I don't seem to have the knack of tea infusers -- they all seem to shed the leaves a little too much.  So, here is my solution today -- yes, a coffee filter in a ceramic infuser.  It worked quite well, actually!   ceramic infuserI think I should look for some smaller filterswater addedMaddening infusers!This nice warm tea was very welcome this morning as the temperature had dropped 45 degrees overnight.  I went to bed in the tropics and woke up in the arctic!  I did brave the cold wind to take a couple of snaps of the yard after a couple of freezes and a lot of wind.  It is lovely, actually but I didn't want to stay out there too long!Pear tree in lovely fall colorsAnother pear treeand yet the OTHER pear treethe crab apple tree today!and the mint just keeps on keeping onI know that north Texas isn't really known for it's fall color but I think we have done a pretty good job in our yard, don't you?And now, totally unrelated, I thought I would share with Mary, Bonnie and Jane some pics of the Bean on her trip to England this last summer.  I sharing these with permission from her mother, of course.Bean and the PigSuch a grown up little bridesmaid!Bean and her mother at the church in BramleyI wasn't at the wedding but the photos are lovely and I think it was a wonderful day for all.Ok, now I need to go deal with those leftovers! It is lunch time, after all."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, November 24, 2014", "text": "Cleaning the House New/Old School -- aka -- I Am Really LazySaturday was a banner day for me.  I got up with loads of energy and I had great plans.  I was going to clean house.  Now, you must understand -- this sort of thing doesn't happen to me often.  I am not domestic.  Not even remotely.  I grew up with a mother that would be known today as a \"clean freak\".  She cleaned -- a lot.  I don't know that she LOVED it -- I don't remember her saying but she detested clutter and there was precious little around of that.  Of course, we lived in a 950 sq. ft. house which was typical of the time so there wasn't a lot of room for too much clutter.  In any event, I always lived in a very clean -- I mean Clorox clean -- house. My children lived in a clean house but I really couldn't stand the smell of Clorox so I used other things.  I used to clean the bathroom tile with a toothbrush and dust didn't land anywhere.  We lived in a small house but we had more room to store things so more things were collected.The kids grew.  The collections grew.  I learned that one would not die from clutter.  One might go crazy but not die.  So what did I do, little Mrs. Non-Domestic?  I decided to ignore the whole thing and take up hobbies.  Lots of hobbies with lots and lots of things.  More clutter, more mess, yuck.So, the kids are grown, most of their stuff has gone and I have reached a point in my life that I want my toothbrush and tile floors back.  I don't want the hobby stuff, I don't want the clutter, I can live without the magazines -- I just want it clean.Well, that's great but over the years I have learned to really, really dislike housework.  So, back to Saturday.  I decided to start cleaning in my bedroom.  I have a large window seat that seems to attract \"stuff\" like a magnet.  I worked on that for quite sometime.  Then I dusted, vacuumed, tacked the bathroom...you know, cleaned the room.  It. Took. All, Day.  I decided to do everything with the vacuum cleaner -- I dusted the furniture, I dusted the shutters, I dusted the exercise equipment (which needs a new home, BTW) and at the end of the day you couldn't tell I had done a thing.  I was too tired to even put the vacuum cleaner away.Fast forward to today.  I got up with great plans -- going to finish cleaning the house.  BUT.....I was going old school -- with sort of new techniques.  I dusted with microfiber cloths, cleaned the bathrooms with microfiber cloths, dust mopped the hard floors with my Big Woolly wool dust mop, use my little carpet sweeper on the throw rugs, mopped with my Rubbermaid microfiber spray mop and threw away all the seasonal holiday catalogs that have invaded my mailbox.I got all that done in the length of time it took me to argue with myself about dragging out the vacuum cleaner. So, I guess it is official. I am living in the 50's.  I am just a little lazy.  I am not keeping up with the times but I got done quickly enough today to have time to play with my Nook tablet -- the one I have had for two years and not messed with -- and I figured out how to check out library books on it and how to listen to audio books on it!So, yes, a day well spent!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, November 16, 2014", "text": "The Mistress's DaughterA few days ago I finished reading \"Somewhere Safe with Somebody Good\" and was looking for a short read before I was scheduled to receive a book order from Ebay.  I went to my bookshelf -- the one that is completely organized with a good number of unread books and I searched for something that looked like a quick yet interesting read.My eyes fell on \"The Mistress's Daughter\" by A.M. Homes.  It is not a long book and I figured that I could knock it out pretty quickly which I did.  I figured it was a novel about, well, a mistress's daughter.  I was wrong.  At the first page I realized that I was reading an autobiography.  A really sad autobiography.  I will admit it was pretty depressing in the beginning and then we hear about Ms. Homes learning that her biological mother was looking for her.  We are introduced to the biological mother only to realize that she isn't a stable person.  We meet the father and learn that he isn't a great guy and never was.  During all of this we don't hear a whole lot about the adoptive parents -- it is a story of her struggle to deal with her past.  As the book progresses, however, and Ms. Homes learns more and more of her heritage we learn of her desire to join the DAR and her struggled with that.  As I read along the book that started out a personal and painful journey turned into a genealogical study which fascinated me.  Toward the end we learn about her adoptive family and the grandmother that Ms. Homes adores -- and the table.  The table is fascinating. All in all, I really enjoyed this book.  It was different than I imagined, it was sad, it was emotional but, in the end, it was joyful.  For a quick read to sandwich between more important books, it was a great choice but  it was too good to be a \"sandwich\" so if you want to read it, give it the time it deserves.  As I looked at the picture of that beautiful child on the cover I felt that I had even let her down, sandwiching her story between other stories and that was not right.  It is well worth reading and it deserves the time and attention of any other work that might be in your queue.I definitely recommend to anybody who does genealogy, anybody adopted who doesn't know their whole story or anybody who is just interested in a completely different, compelling read."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, November 14, 2014", "text": "Somewhere Safe With Somebody Good -- Jan KaronI have just finished reading Jan Karon's latest instalment in the Mitford series  -- Somewhere Safe With Somebody Good.  Prior to this book, Karon had more or less ended this series and then  proceeded with the Father Tim books which dealt with Father Tim's youth and with a monumental trip to Ireland.  Both of those books were a little deeper and darker than the Mitford series, they showed a different side of the beloved Father Tim.This latest work, however, brings us back to Mitford after Father Tim and Cynthia's visit to Ireland.  They don't have long to get settled back into their usual routine before the life in the little North Carolina town draws them in.  There is the family with the good news -- Dooley -- and the bad news -- Sammy.  There are the long time friends, neighbors and parishioners -- some we watch go from deep despair to great joy - Hope -- and the possible romance -- Helene and Harley maybe? Or perhaps the spray tan queen and the fly boy.  Father Tim is involved in all their lives to some extent and it is so interesting to watch him juggle these relationships with grace and the knowledge of when to get involved and when not to.  His wisdom would be a good lesson for anybody.For anybody who thinks small town life would be boring they should read the Mitford books.  Are small towns really like this?  I wouldn't know but I like to think they are.  In any event, I enjoyed once more, being able to \"live\" in Mitford for a while.  I hope there is another in the series so that we aren't left hanging wanting to know what happens to Hope, Scott and Grace and Dooley and Lace and all the rest of the quirky yet loveable characters.  I don't think Karon would do that, however, as there is so much more story to tell.I, for one, will be waiting."},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, November 10, 2014", "text": "Monday --It is Monday.  It is cold and getting colder.  I forgot to take my allergy meds last night so I am all stuffy with a headache.  Should get a flu shot today.  Need to go grocery shopping just in case the weather gets very bad -- I don't think it will but we have been known to have ice in November and I don't want to be caught without the necessary paper products, milk, allergy meds and a turkey.Fortunately I have lots of reading material and sewing projects.  I stocked up on flour, sugar and eggs so I can do some baking if I wish.  Must get some gas in the car just in case.  All this prep should shoot the temps back up into the 70's right?  Isn't that how it usually works?  I have lived in North Texas for 24 years and am still baffled by how much different the weather is here than \"home\" -- San Antonio.Getting on with my Christmas prep.  Going to start some decorations of the homemade variety today.  Have a few things ordered and on the way.  My minimalistic thinking has finally crept into the holidays -- token gifts this year.  Nobody \"needs\" anything we have to give anymore.  When the kids were first married there was always something for their house or their kitchen,now, not so much.  When the kids were tiny there was always some new toy or new clothes but now, their needs have changed as well.  We have a new \"little\" on the way which could probably use some wintery things since she is coming in the middle of this cold snap so that will probably be in order but for the most part -- a few things to let them know we love them and have thought of them -- a hug and a kiss and watch them grow another year.  I have watched my daughter stress out over trying to declutter their house -- mostly outgrown clothes and toys -- and I have made a mental note not to add to that.  Nothing is worse than trying to live in a house that has too much stuff.  Both my children live in adequate -- even large -- houses but realistically -- no house is meant to store unlimited amounts of stuff no longer useable.  So, I will do my part to help them out and my gifts will be thoughtful, small and not of the variety that will generate guilt if they decide to toss them.  Nothing is worse than having to hang on to things because \"somebody made it\" or \"somebody bought that for you\".  They are things and unless it is valuable -- like jewelery or coins or such -- I don't expect my kids to keep what I buy for posterity.  Well, maybe the books.I do like giving books as gifts.  When I was a child reading was a wonderment to me -- I was thrilled when I learned how and from that time on my main source of entertainment was reading.  It still is.  And coloring in color books.  I still love that as well -- yes, I color but I use colored pencils now and color by number books for adults!  Shhh-- don't tell anybody but the latent artist in me -- you know, the one who can't draw a straight line with a ruler -- loves to color.I digress.Speaking of books, I am almost 3/4 of the way done with the new Jan Karon work \"Somewhere Safe With Somebody Good\".  As usual, she has done a beautiful job of creating an environment that I can get lost in.  I can recommend the whole series without reservation.  Great cold weather reads.I bought a couple of books off the internet last week.  The next in the Agatha Raisin series -- \"The Terrible Tourist\" and a book I saw my daughter reading \"An American Childhood\".  I have been reading the Raisin books on my Nook but have discovered that I can get them cheaper by either going to Half Price Books or Ebay.  I don't really want to start collecting the whole series but I have to be cognisant of my quest to get want I want at the very best price I can.  Obviously the best price would be free and I am going to make an effort to frequent the library but it is a habit I have gotten out of and I am sorry -- note to self -- must do better in that department.  I honestly don't know why I am acquiring books in any form at all -- I have two complete shelves on my bookshelf devoted to yet unread books.  Reading, to me, is a bit like quilting -- I have to be in the mood for something so my reading really has no rhyme or reason -- just what hits me at the moment.  Sort of like my entire day to day existence.Blah.Ok, I am getting very rambly now -- don't really have much to say and no really great pics to share.  I am enjoying the pics of the poppies and in the Tower of London moat -- such beauty to represent such sorrow -- very striking photos though -- I hope they leave them there indefinitely.Have a wonderful Monday, all!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, November 05, 2014", "text": "A Rant, A Craft and a PlanOk, first the rant.  I went to Joann Fabric and Craft Store over the weekend to purchase some Wilton decorations for cupcakes.  While I was there I decided to look for some cute Thanksgiving decor.  I don't do much decorating but I love to set small stuff around just for color and atmosphere.  I was taken by surprise when I discovered that there was nothing there! No little pillows or pictures, nothing with inspirational words, nothing orange/gold/green -- no TURKEYS!  Instead I found myself in an ocean of red and green peppermint stripes! Really?  When did we do away with Thanksgiving?  Is this political?  Is this an effort to make American's forget our history?  If it is that easy to just simple abolish something as traditional as Thanksgiving is Christmas next? Probably not -- too much money involved there.  While I am sure it is just a \"retail thing\" my imagination makes me think there is something more sinister afoot.  If nothing else, America needs to slow down.  Way down.  We are just charging through life like a lightening bolt.  I don't like it.  Not one bit.  Something has to change but I am afraid that it has to be the people that change it because I don't think the retail society will do anything but get worse.  I for one am closing out the retail world until after New Years. Bah humturkey.Rant over.I haven't said much here because my daughter in law prefers her privacy and I respect that wish but, in the middle of Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas plans, we are expecting a new addition to the family.  A baby is due to my son and daughter in law in mid November so  we are planning for this event as well.  I was asked to provide some crafty items so I spent last weekend working on these and this is what I came up with.It is common practice here to decorate the hospital doors with something festive to let the visitors know who is new and who is living in that room for a day or two.  I have done this with my other three grandchildren and this one is no different.  So, this is what I did for the door --Painted some wooden letter with Wicker White craft paint and pink paint pen for accentsSewed some pink fabric from the quilt to some green fabric and backed with fusible interfacing (Pellon)Placed in an embroidery hoop and glued the edges down -- secured with clothes pins till dryBlank canvas waiting for embellishmentGlued on the name and then a cute little wooden bunny.  The bunny was chosen because there is a bunny in the quilt fabricI chose these ribbons to go with the colors of the fabricBig puffy bows aren't my strong suit but it looks okFinished product! Hanging by a sheer white ribbonI am making a quilt but I am not finished.  It isn't a secret so I will share some information about it.  It is a wrapping paper quilt -- or striped quilt-- the fabrics are peach/pink/green/turquoise and a stripe.  It is the striped fabric that also has a little turquoise bunny.  It sounds boyish but it isn't -- it is very girly and I really like the way the colors work together to make a very lively, yet babyish quilt.  I will post photos when done.I was also asked to make a dresser scarf and a nightstand scarf.  I did that as well but I didn't have enough quilt fabric to use so I just chose a white fabric with very pale pink polka dots.  It will blend nicely with the quilt even if it doesn't match perfectly.  Unfortunately I was in such a hurry to get the project completed I didn't take photos but they were very plain so you can imagine what they looked like. So, that brings me to \"The Plan\".  It has occurred to me that my record keeping practices need to be improved upon.  Maybe that should read \"implemented\" as I don't really keep records of any sort about anything.  Then, when I need to refer back to a project, a purchase  or a recipe I don't have anything to look at and my memory is good but I am finding that it isn't as easy to recall some things as it used to be.  I do have a recipe box which works nicely for the recipes but I decided that I needed a notebook for just that -- notes.  While in my neighborhood Target store the other day I noticed that they had cute little 5 X 8 loose leaf notebooks with all the supplies -- paper, dividers, etc.  I was headed out this a.m. to get one but one look at the pouring rain and I decided to look around and see what I had in the house that would suffice.I just love it when I practice what I preach!  Shop your own house!  I found a 1\" white loose leaf binder that is brand new, unused.  I still buy school supplies in August, even though my children are grown, and I have a huge supply of notebook paper.  I picked up a bag and what did I find but a new set of dividers.  So, I didn't have to go out in the rain and I didn't have to spend any money to buy what I already had.  I felt so accomplished! Now that I have the \"household\" notebook and a set of 8 dividers I am going to organize my purchases, recipes that I use routinely, ongoing lists, holiday lists, etc.  And I am keeping it where I can find it and refer to it -- no putting it away.  Oh, I also have a brand new box of page protectors so I can use those as well.So, that is what I have been up to.  In the next few days I will be finishing the quilt and some Christmas projects I have started.  I will share all of it when I am farther alongOh yes -- Happy Guy Fawkes Day to all my British family and friends!"},

C. Beaton's character Agatha Raisin.I think Elizabeth's idea of a pen pal is a great idea.  However, it has been a long time since I have written real letters and the process is so different than dashing of a quick email or a facebook comment.  It takes thought and time which I think is wonderful.  I think our lifestyles have made it too easy to scratch the surface of friendships -- with a real letter you have to sit down and concentrate on what you are doing to communicate well with another person.  I have found my handwriting has changed as well.  Since I don't write as often I feel like I have forgotten how.  My first letter to Mary I actually printed because I can't write longhand anymore -- my hand cramps up and it becomes illegible almost immediately.  The printing was better but oh my goodness I didn't expect that!  Hopefully I won't be printing forever but I am afraid I am going to have to actually practice longhand again.  Who knew!??I just wrote my second letter to Mary tonight and it will go out in tomorrow's mail.  I am anxious to see what she thinks about the book and I am very interested in her Christmas projects.  I think she will be very inspiring and make me want to be more creative than I have been of late.So, I am very excited at the prospect of making this new friend and going back to doing things \"old school\" because I think it is important.  This exercise has just shown me that while technology is great we can't lose the skills that we used to have."},

It was yummy!So, that is what fall looks like at Casa Brinkley- I will take photos of the pear trees when they change but they really aren't too spectacular -- they become a lovely yellow and within a day all the leaves are on the ground -- but I won't neglect to share them as well when the time comes."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, October 20, 2014", "text": "Musing Mondays is hosted by Miz B at shouldbereading.wordpress.com.  This meme gives readers the opportunity to discuss all aspects of their reading experience.Lately I have been reading the Agatha Raisin mystery series by M. C. Beaton.  The books are about a 50-something Agatha Raisin, retired PR firm owner, who has moved to the Cotswolds to enjoy quiet, village life.   Her life, however, has been anything but quiet.  When she first arrived she had quite an adjustment to village life as compared to her busy life in London.  She made an effort to involve herself in village events which proved to be a disaster.  She angered people and she was annoyed by almost everybody -- except her next door neighbor, James Lacey.  As time has gone on and the series has progressed she has made friends, she has settled into the rhythm of the village, she has acquired cats and she has managed to lose her cottage -- but in the latest \"episode\" that is being resolved.I guess whenever we read we have a mental picture of the characters and when I think of Agatha Raisin I see a thinner -- but not too thin -- Dawn French.  I know there is a tv series currently being filmed based on this series and the actress is definitely not Dawn French but I will always think of her when I read these books. The books have gotten mixed reviews on Goodreads.  I think they are the sort of thing that you either like or you don't.  Well, I do.  They are short which is great because I can sandwich one or two between longer reads, they are engaging which is a necessary attribute and they are, in a word, entertaining and, in my opinion, that is why I read for the most part, to be entertained.I would recommend these books to anybody who likes mysteries.  My only suggestion is that you start with the first book as they do build on each other.Happy reading!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, October 17, 2014", "text": "Sad DayYesterday was a sad day.  I had a falling out with a family member.  It was over nothing -- a meaningless subject.  Somebody's temper flared -- not mine -- and somebody was yelling at me in all caps on the computer.  Somebody was issuing orders to me about what I could and could not talk about.  Somebody flopped his/her big foot into my personal space.A year and a half ago I had a health \"adventure\" and I decided then to make a few changes in my life.  I decided to eat healthy and clean -- something I am still working on due to the call of the muse cookie.  I decided to get more sleep. I decided to live a more natural life, get rid of plastic, let my hair grow, give up makeup, quit striving to aspire to the \"expected\" and quit being a sheep. I decided to quit worrying about things I couldn't change. I decided to do what I wanted to do and not what other people expected me to do.  I am 64 years old and have spent the majority of my life doing what others wanted/needed/expected or just demanded. It was time for me.  Part of that, unfortunately, means getting rid of toxic people.  Now, by that I mean toxic to me.  One lesson we learn as children is that \"not everybody is going to like everybody else\".  Sometimes people just don't click.  That doesn't mean that they aren't good people or wouldn't be a good \"friend\" fit for others -- just not me.So, I have a family member that I have never met face to face but we have a phone/email relationship and have had for years.  This person finds it perfectly appropriate to tease me about my age mercilessly.  This person also finds it acceptable to let me know that my place of residence (Texas) is substandard as a dwelling place because of the climate.  This person can't let it go.  It is constant and never-ending. If I say something that this person doesn't agree with -- which is a lot -- I am bombared by demands in all caps -- the computer version of yelling.Yesterday a benign conversation about safes turned into a screaming match and I was appalled.  The conversation included the name of a popular talk show host that this person seems to have strong negative feelings about and I mentioned the name.  The family member went ballistic.  At this point I thought about my new \"rules\" for myself -- no toxic people.Family member went on a verbal rampage telling me that when he/she says to stop talking about something I better stop and that  my conversations are too pushy.  So, I decided to relieve said family member's misery and I have departed from the conversation -- now and forever.Unreasonable?  Probably but my goal is to keep my stress levels down and I didn't understand all the concern about a talk show host who I don't even listen to because I am not a fan and even if I was I don't have time! I didn't like being yelled at and ordered about.  I am a gentle person who feels that everybody has a right to an opinion -- even me -- and my opinion is that I don't like being yelled at or bossed around.I understand that this person has health issues as well and a lot of physical pain.  For that, I am sorry but again, I also don't enjoy being on the receiving end of so much anger.  I don't feel it is good for me. So, I wish this person well but I have to take care of myself and reducing my stress level is part of it and if that doesn't set well, I apologize.   Jumping off soap box now."},

It is cloudy and windy and just grumpy outside -- so spooky like!Ok, enough of that.I have never been huge in the decorating department for any holiday.  I like decorations, I like looking at decorations, I like the atmosphere that decorations impart.  I do not, however, like the hefty price tags on ready made decor (or for the components to craft lovely handmade items)  and even more, I don't like having to put it all away with so little storage space as I have.  So, I am a minimalist decorator.  However, this year I added a couple of things and thought I would share.My header shows the small decorations outside my front door.  My front door is inside a wall with a gate and the area is more courtyard- like so I like to keep things uncluttered.  Some of us are clumsy normally, a condition that doesn't improve with age, so I try to keep the fall/stumble/trip risk to a minimum. Moving indoors, I would never do anything major for a holiday such as Halloween but I do like adding a few fall touches just to warm up the space.  This is what I add to liven things up -- not much for sure but just enough for me.This little guy has been around since my kids were little. He is very cheerful.Decided to dress up the table with new placemats - they reverse to Thanksgiving so I will share that laterTrying out a bit of a banner on the mantel -- I might do this again for Thanksgiving and Christmas -- depends on my available timeThis cute clear glass pumpkin was purchased last year -- it is small and almost sparklySo, there is my interior decoration.  I might add a bit to it if I run into something really cute but if I do, it will be autumn inspired and not Halloween -- I like things I can use to span the entire season because as I said -- putting the stuff away is not my idea of a fun time!Happy Fall!"},

I was a member of the Nancy Drew Book Club and I have to say my mother and my aunt thoroughly enjoyed those books --- I, however, did not -- until now.I don't know where my interest in mysteries has come at my advanced age unless I am channelling my mother and she is interested in what I am reading.  However, over the last couple of years, my interest in mystery books has exploded.It all started with the Aunt Dimity series which I am well into although I am giving it a rest right now.  Then, I read a bit of Nancy Drew which was good fun although a little dated.  Now I have stumbled upon the Agatha Raisin series by M. C. Beaton.  All of these are wonderful little books -- none very long and all very quick reads.I just finished my fourth Agatha Raisin mystery -- \"The Dembly Walkers\" and it was delightful.  In addition to the actual mystery, you have the ongoing quasi-romance of Agatha and her neighbor James Lacey.  In this installment the romance becomes -- well, you will just have to read it to find out.I have already downloaded book #5 and look forward to the appearance of Agatha's husband -- thought long dead -- at a very inconvenient time.The covers of the books are very nice and here is what I have read so far.  I have them on my Nook but being the collector I am, I see me buying the physical books for my ever growing collection.Won't you join me in reading these great little books?Ta!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, October 04, 2014", "text": "Planning, Planning, PlanningEarlier this year I needed a planner but I needed it at an odd time of the year and not many were available  so I did some research on making my own, found a tutorial using a Moleskine and I set about DIY-ing a planner.It has worked really well but it is bulky and heavy.  As I have gotten -- ahem -- older, I have discovered that heavy bags aren't my friend so I have started \"downsizing\" what I carry in a bag. So, because of that I started looking for a lighter weight yet flexible planner.  I don't have a lot to plan -- just keeping up with birthdays, little trips, dr. appts., that sort of thing so my needs are simple.  I googled \"smaller planner\" and went to the first option that came up -- MochiThings.comThis is such a cute site! So many  cute things to choose from! I mean, this like San Rio for adults! I chose this option for the planner --It is dateless and the calendar squares are decent sized.  It is VERY plain which suits me just fine.  It is lightweight which suits me even more. It was a decent price which cinched the deal for me.  I am looking forward to getting it. I hate giving up my moleskine planner because there is a lot of room for lists and such but I think this will be a better option.  However, if you are in the market for something a little less utilitarian, they have many patterned things and all sorts of accessories and things. Speaking of downsizing your purse -- maybe I should say \"downweighting\" your purse, I recently changed wallets as well.  I have any number of wallets from leather to fabric, big, little, strapped -- all sorts.  They are all either too small, too large, too heavy, hold to much, don't hold enough -- can't find the perfect wallet.  However, I might have come close with this --It is the Big Skinny wallet and I bought it at Office Depot.  It is nylon, it is weightless, it is stuffable -- it is actually working very well for me.  Mine isn't teal, though -- mine is red so I can see it. I was looking at the pouches on the mochithings website and might look into some lightweight nylon makeup bags and stuff like that.  While I don't carry a lot, I do like to carry some things so maybe I can lighten the load a little more."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, September 29, 2014", "text": "29 September 2014I haven't participated in the Musing Mondays meme for a while.  It is hosted by MizB at Should Be Reading.  Basically, it is a place for you to talk about your reading, with or without prompts.I thought that today I would share what has caught my attention in the literary world recently.   Of course, I obtained my copy, the day it was released, of Jan Karon's new title \"Somewhere Safe with Somebody Good\".  It is the next in the Mitford series, the first in a while after her two fantastic reads in the Father Tim series.  I can't tell you how it feels to read Karon's Mitford series books.  You feel like you are going \"home\" or to a different time/place (although they are very contemporary).  The books all take place in the fictional town of Mitford and, like all small towns, it has a cast of very colorful, loveable and not so loveable characters and there is always one you can identify with or say you know somebody \"just like that\".  This is the sort of book you can settle in with and just lose yourself for a while.  Yep, they are that good. However, if you are just beginning with the Karon series please start at the beginning with the first one.  They will make much better sense that way!I have also been reading M. C. Beaton's Agatha Raisin series.  I started out reading her Hamish MacBeth series and then started following her on Facebook and decided to pick up one of the Agatha Raisin series and give it a go.  I started at the beginning with the first one and was instantly hooked.  I am now on my third and don't see myself stopping anytime soon.  These are delightful little mysteries, quick reads, engaging and humorous.  They are being made into a tv show in the UK -- I certainly hope we get to see it here in the States!Happy Fall!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, September 27, 2014", "text": "Happy Autumn!I meant to do this several days ago but I hadn't gotten my pumpkins yet.  Earlier I decided today was the day to do my pumpkin shopping.  Since my \"stoop\" isn't very large I buy little bitty pumpkins just to add some color.  I really love those huge heirloom or fairytale pumpkins, and I think one would fit, but I don't want to make getting in and out of the door difficult  so I opt for little ones and call it \"my minimalist decor\".  The flowers in the pot are not real.  It is hard to keep anything watered on that little porch so I opted for some colorful, silk items just to bring some color in.  Of course, it doesn't feel like fall here but I like to go by the calendar rather than the weather when decorating.  If I waited for it to feel like fall there would probably be about five minutes between putting out fall decorations and Christmas decorations so I just do it when it is logical because our weather isn't logical.So, on to make zucchini bread and cookies! Have a wonderful weekend."},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, September 14, 2014", "text": "\"How To Make Yourself Miserable\"  by Dan GreenburgRecently, on Facebook, there was a challenge going around to name the ten books that impacted you the most. At the end of the challenge you were supposed to challenge others to join in.  This was one of the more thought provoking challenges around so I thought I would take part.  I thought I would just rattle off ten books that came off the top of my head -- that should do it -- but when I looked at the list I was quite surprised to see what I had written.  The first book was The Bible.  Now, you are probably saying \"how stereotypical -- doesn't everybody put that on a list of this sort\"?  Well, I don't know but I know why I put it on mine -- I am not a Bible scholar by any means, haven't read it all the way through, don't carry a well worn leather bound copy with me at all times but I do know that it contains all the answers I need to any problem that life can hand me and so I feel that is a huge impact on me.  The last book on the list was actually a set of books -- The World Book Encyclopedia.  I remember my mother purchasing the set of books from a door - to - door salesman.  He took the order and we had to wait for them to be delivered.  I remember the night they came -- it was a rainy evening, the sun had gone down and, since this was before FedEX and UPS, the postal service brought it.  I remember being so excited.  I remember arranging the books on the bookshelves in my room and I also remember systematically going through each book and pretty much reading through it.  I loved those books.Just for the record, I remember learning how to spell \"encyclopedia\" from Jiminy Cricket on the Mickey Mouse Club.There were various other books on the list that had lasting impact on me like \"Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl\", \"The Good Master\" and the Jan Karon Mitford books.  Most of my offereings were children's books but then, isn't that when we are the most impressionable?I digress.  I went on to challenge several other people and one person, Jim M., took the challenge to heart.  He gave it considerable thought and came up with a really good list -- quite varied, all interesting (although a lot of it over my head).  One book, \"How to Make Yourself Miserable\" was one that he recommended I read so I went on to Ebay, found a copy, bought it and read it.  As I told Jim -- it was hysterically funny and painfully relatable all at the same time!A bit of a back story -- Jim M. and I knew each other in elementary and junior high school.  He was a member of the educational sub-group known as the \"smart kids\".  There was a whole group of these boys, and I remember all of them, that just reeked of intelligence.  I was on the edge of this group because I was very good in English and history -- not so much in math -- I would have trouble counting to 20 using my fingers and toes but wasn't that the expected norm for girls in the 50's-60's?  I think so.  Now, this sub-group of super smart children wasn't the same as the \"A\" group of the social elite -- you know, the \"popular\" ones.  I definitely wasn't a part of THAT group -- I was sort of a social group of my own -- so I floated around the periphery of the \"smart kids\" and the rest of the time I just lived in my own little world.  Now, Jim M. and I went to different high schools -- he went to the high school with the \"smart kids\" and I went to the one closest to my house.  Time marched on and lots of life happened and only with the advent of social media did I make contact with classmates from the past, including Jim M.  It was no surprise to me that Jim M. had grown up to be a professor -- of math -- and it was no surprise to me that he is well read and has a wide variety of interests.  It is no surprise to me that he has a well developed vocabulary as well.  What did surprise me is that he remembered me.  It was a pleasant surprise and we have gone on to have many conversations about our school days and our lives since, about what has happened to many of our friends and our current interests.  So, I was interested in his list of books and was anxious to read the one he recommended to me -- \"How to Make Yourself Miserable\".\"How to Make Yourself Miserable\" is a guide book, so to speak, on how to punish yourself for all your guilts, how to create, maintain and perpetuate all manner of anxiety and how to, bascially, undermine yourself until you completely alienate the entire world.  This book was written in 1966 and I have to say that it was geared to the young adults of the time, those who were raised in the late 40's and 50's with the mores of the era and all the guilt that went along with it.  As I read along, I could relate to so many of the hilarious scenarios that were presented.  Of course, not all those scenarios were from decades past -- the airplane bit was much more currently relative.   In any event, I must have mellowed out in my dotage because I found it all to be quite amusing whereas, if I had read the book when it was published, I would have recognized myself right off the bat and that would have created an anxiety of its own.It was a fun read.  I would recommend if you can get a copy of it.  Out of print, I am sure.  Thanks, Jim M. for the suggestion."},

C. Beaton.I have read several of her Hamish Macbeth series and found them to be very entertaining so I decided to check out Agatha Raisin.  Being the logical sort that I am I decided to start at the beginning.  So, I downloaded \"The Quiche of Death\" onto my Nook and started reading.  I couldn't put it down!

It was a hard breakup but it was me, not the book.  Once I got over the disappointment of really not connecting I picked up a book that I had bought a couple of months ago that was just calling my name every time I walked past it.  It proved to be a much better relationship.\"The Last Original Wife\" by Dorothea Benton Frank was just the latest in the string of her books that I have been enjoying over the last couple of years.  The first one I enjoyed was \"Folly Beach\" which I listened to as an audio book.  I have read several others and feel that while Frank follows a definite formula when writing these books, they are still good reads and very satisfying.\"The Last Original Wife\" was no different.  It was about a disgruntled (and rightly so) wife, a louse of a husband, a gay brother, two ungrateful kids, an old flame, a lot of money, big houses, and fancy cars.  It moved along quickly and there was a lot of action -- especially when it came to \"the Barbies\".  It was a fun read -- I learned to really dislike Wes from the beginning and I think my favorite character of all was Harlan, the brother.  Oh, and the ghost -- can't forget the ghost -- and the dogs.  Gotta love the dogs. It was a great read and I was sorry to see it end.  On to the next one -- \"The Hurricane Sisters\".  Hopefully I can get to it before I pick up my copy of Jan Karon's new offering \"Somewhere Safe With Somebody Good\".  Hopefully my dry reading spell is over because there are a lot of really good things coming out."},

Yes, probably so.  I looked at the various packages of butter in our refrigerator and while most of them said \"cream and salt\", all of them said \"coloring\".  They were specific about what that mean so I think that my home-grown butter is probably a better choice.Next time I will take photos."},

{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, August 03, 2014", "text": "I WonderI regularly read a lovely blog -- Penhallowstreet.blogspot.com -- authored by Bonnie.  Bonnie is a wonderful artist both with a pencil and a needle.  She has a strong faith, a wonderful outlook, and writes very thought provoking posts.In her latest post she wrote about Sundays and how they have changed from her childhood.  Her post caused me to pause and think -- go back in time mentally to those Sundays of my childhood.  I remember those days being very long and sometimes boring.  Once I could read, I remember those days being filled with beautiful words which wove beautiful stories. I remember my mother cooking a large meal -- it was always roast -- and it was all so good.  I remember liking Sundays more as I got older.  I enjoyed the quiet of it all, the change of pace, I even enjoyed the boredom of it.Then things changed.  Somehow -- I think it was when stores started opening on Sundays -- things got busy.  Sunday wasn't any different than Monday or Tuesday.  It was just another day.  It seems we never got a break from the busyness of life.  No wonder everybody is so tired!I think we should go back to having Sunday.  No, I am not talking about time travel -- push a few buttons and whoosh -- we are back in the 50's.  We can, however, edit ourselves.  How about if we plan our time so that we clear our calendars for Sunday except for church.  How about if we plan our Sunday meal so that it can be mostly cooked on Saturday.  How about if pretend the stores are closed, shop accordingly prior to Sunday and just take a shopping break.  How about -- get ready, here it comes -- if we take a break from technology.  What if we turn off the computers and phones.  What if we sit down with the Sunday paper (we don't even take the paper anymore).  What if we listen to the radio, have the family over, read a book, just do something different than we do on a day to day basis.As I read Bonnie's post I realized she is a very wise woman.  She mentioned the feeling of guilt if we aren't busy all the time.  She reminds us that we are given Sunday as a day of rest because we NEED the rest.  Our bodies and our minds can't function properly without rest.  So, if society isn't going to allow us to rest, we are going to have to take it upon ourselves to create our own rest.So, I am suggesting that we take Sunday back and live it as it was intended.  I think the first thing I am going to do is give my electronics a rest as well.  The second thing I am going to do is plan my Sunday meal so that it is mostly done on Saturday and I can enjoy the day and a good meal without slaving away in the kitchen.  When those two things are done I am going to set aside time to do something that I want to do that I can't find the time for during the week.  It might be reading, it might be sewing or needlework but it will be something that brings me joy and gives me relaxation.So, does anybody want to join me in a technology free Sunday?  Sounds like a challenge to me.Family ReunionThe morning was unusually cool for August in Texas. We rose early in preparation for the drive ahead.  The day had come for the biennial Bordovsky/Hudec family reunion.  I was ambivalent about it, as was my husband if I am to speak honestly.  However, his mother is 93 so who knows how many more of these get-togethers she will be able to attend so we dressed, grabbed up our contribution to the table -- traditional Czech kolaches -- picked up Granny and off we went.After about an hour and half drive and a Starbucks stop, we arrived at the small, central Texas community of Elk.Countryside around Elk, Texas behind St. Joseph's Catholic Church Elk is situated outside of Waco and is primarily a farming/cotton growing community.  It's only claim to fame, to my knowledge, is that the Elk store was the ATF headquarters during the seige at the David Koresh Branch Davidian community, Mount Carmel,  back in 1993.Memorial to the ATF agents who were lost in the Branch Davidian conflict in 1993My husband's grandfather immigrated from Moravia in about 1884 as did the Kubitza family--his grandmother's family.  Little did they know that the families would come together again years later in a marriage which combined Grandfather's family from another marriage, Grandma's family from another marriage and grew with a number of children from their own union.  It was a big family and these families continued to grow which meant these reunions were large, loud, rambuctious affairs!  When I started going to these reunions I was amazed at the number of people who attended.  We would take family group photos that were as large as classroom group photos.Over time, however, the family inevitably began to shrink.  Many family members have been lost -- from the youngest to the oldest -- and now only three of the original \"children\" remain.  The extended families have grown up and been scattered all over.  There doesn't seem to be a really good time of the year for everybody to get together but the cousins that do the planning do the best they can to be accommodating. This year there were only two children, my grandchildren, so there was a sharp contrast to past reunions.These reunions take place at the Catholic church -- St. Joseph's -- that the family has been involved with for generations.  It is a small church with a small cemetery and a really nice parish hall.  The food is outstanding -- and there is always so much.  The desserts are mouthwatering -- pecan pies, fruit cobblers, German chocolate cake and, of course, kolaches.St. Joseph's Catholic Church, El, TXThe concession stand!We socialized, caught up, missed the three that were lost since the last reunion, looked at beautiful, old photos scattered on the tables, ate our fill and said our goodbyes, promising to see each other again in two years.  It was a quiet time this year -- we all commented on the unusually cool weather as the breeze blew through the doors at either end of the parish hall.  As that breeze blew I could almost feel the spirits of those who were no longer with us, passing through that hall.Natural Cosmetic UpdateIf you have read my previous posts on this subject, you will know that I have been on a quest for natural cosmetics and have found some wonderful brands with great products.  However, I have also discovered that most of them have lousy lipsticks, at least for me.  Unfortunately, I am the sort of person that needs some sort of lipstick so I don't look like a cadaver.  So, I went looking for a nice, neutral lipstick -- not shiny, just creamy with enough color so I look a little perkier.I happened upon this --NARS Cosmetics sheer lipstick in Dolce Vita.  Cult favorite, they say.  Beautiful color, a tad pricey.  Bought it, used it, was happy in my lipstick find until I started researching the product and found it to be very toxic.  So.....I went on a quest to find something a little more acceptable.I spent a good portion of Friday talking to the people at Clinique and reading reviews at EWG.org and goodguide.com.  I finally went to the mall and discussed my plight with one of the lovely ladies at the Clinique counter.  We found an exact match -- Nearly Violet - in the High Impact line.  Now, not all of Clinique's products are rated really well, but these lipsticks seemed to be acceptable.I also did some research on the L'oreal line and found an almost perfect match there, as well.  It is called Eva's Nude and is close enough for me to consider it a duplicate.  Across the board, L'oreal's line seemed to be acceptable in the toxicity department as well.  I was really glad to find a couple of replacements for this really nice, go with everything color.In the process of trying all this makeup and taking a long look at the \"mature\" me, I have decided that this is one area where the saying \"less is more\" has a great deal of meaning.  So, for a couple of days, I have used a neutral eye makeup -- I have to use eye makeup or my eyes disappear -- and I have used the lipstick -- no foundation or blush -- just some nice moisturizer and I have to say that I was pleased.  I had enough junk on to feel \"finished\" but not smothered.  I will continue on this path for a while because I think it looks better, feels better, costs less and a lot less in my makeup bag if I feel the need to carry it with me."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, July 16, 2014", "text": "The Little Bookcase Gussied UpIn a previous post I shared with you our latest DIY project -- an old chest of drawers reincarnated into a bookcase.  Thirty years ago we were using the chest of drawers, painted white, as extra storage in the hallway.  I thought we needed a small lamp to go on it, something unusual and something we could DIY so I sent my husband out to look for something.  He came back with an item quite similar to this --Since our house was primarily Early American at the time, it went just fine so he drilled a hole in the top, wired it, filled it full of gravel and voila! lamp!It has gone through a couple of incarnations over the years but I decided to pull it out, repaint it and put it back in it's rightful home on top of the chest of drawers/bookcase.Here was the process and the finished product.I had previously painted the coffee pot with green/gold/white creating sort of a patina lookFirst coat of Folk Art Raw UmberAdding copper highlights after three coats of the raw umberNew lampshade and sitting on top of a vintage hankyAnd here is the finished productI haven't finished merchandising the top yet -- don't know what to put on it -- I have options -- or maybe nothing.  I don't like clutter so maybe nothing. Anyway, I am now in the process of sorting through my books and trying to organize them is like trying to herd cats for me.   The new, smaller bookcase is dedicated to books I have read.  The shelves are deep enough for me to have two rows on each shelf.  The shelf you see here has books stacked in the back of the ones you see so there is a lot of storage here.  The large bookcase is housing the books that I need to read.  Ok, so far, so good. Now comes the difficult part.  How do you choose which books to become a permanent part of your personal library?  It stands to reason that you will keep any books that were gifted to you and any that you might have that are signed copies.  The next category would be, I suppose, those that you really liked -- that touched you in some way.  But, then, what about the books that don't fit into any of those categories?  What about the piles of books bought off sale tables, some years ago, that have never been picked up?For instance, I bought a copy of \"Marjorie Morningstar\" off ebay a number of years ago.  I had seen the movie when I was a young teen and read the book back then and always liked it.  So, I went out on ebay and found a copy and bid on it, ultimately winning the auction.  The book wasn't in great shape and smelled a bit funky but on the shelf it went, never to be picked up again.  Do I really need to keep that?  I can't decide.  It still smells funky.  I have childhood books that I won't part with but what about other childrens books I have bought, randomly, online or in used bookstores.  Did I really want them or was I just in a mood to collect.  I am just not sure.  Then there is the question of hardbacks vs paperbacks -- are paperbacks collectible?  Is there any point?  I wish I knew.So, how do you deal with books?  How do you decide what goes into a personal library that you want to keep?  I guess I will just keep shifting them around until I get tired of it and chuck all of them.  Well, not ALL of them."},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, July 13, 2014", "text": "I Can Finally Share --I used to quilt a lot but for a number of reasons, I have sort of lost interest in the craft.  However, there is the occasional baby quilt to make and that is what I have been working on the last month or so.  Since I have been learning the English Paper Piecing technique I decided to use that approach to this project.  Now, granted, this project was just squares and the EPP technique was more work that it needed to be but I really did enjoy the accuracy of it and am glad I did it.  Also, I decided to machine quilt the project instead of hand quilting because it is meant to be used and washed and I just thought it would be stronger.  Ok, that sounded good but the real reason was that this was meant to be a baby quilt and not a kindergarten nap map and I wanted to get it done in a reasonable period of time.  If time had not been a concern, I would have hand quilted it to keep it all consistent.  The new baby is a boy and his mom is doing his room in gray, white and turquoise with touches of red so I chose fabrics with those colors.  I also learned something from the Hubs.  As I was connecting the larger sections, I was having a hard time holding everything together to insure the accuracy so he came to my rescue with tiny binder clips.  They worked beautifully and, yes, he isn't getting them back. I also did the binding differently than I had ever done before.  I usually bind each side individually and tuck the ends in and secure. This time I was determined to use a continuous binding and I was thrilled that it worked so well.  I will probably do this sort of binding from now on. So, here are a few of the photos from the project -- I wish I had taken better ones but you will get the idea of how it went.  I was very pleased with the entire project.I used a paper cutter to cut my paper squares for the English Paper PiecingFabric from designer Aneela Hoey -- yes, they are straight pins but I look at them as just a geometic with lots of colorBinder Clips to hold things together Continuous bindingNice design on the back from the straight line quiltingFinished productSo, what do you think?"},

I spent a bit of time looking at pictures of repurposed furniture on pinterest and I decided that the little chest of drawers would make a lovely bookcase.  It didn't take much coaxing for the Hubs to get on board with the idea.  So, since pictures speak a thousand words--Wish I had gotten a photo of the original chest but -- well -- I forgotDrawers removed getting ready to adapt for shelves -- this is before the legs were shortened as wellSomebody put screen under the last drawer -- wonder what they were trying to keep out of the drawer?Getting prepped to mend a hole in the sideReinforcing the sides and putting in new drawer railsStripped of all paint and old finishesSandingTop before stainingLooking goodAdding shelves and trimLegs shortened, first coat of paint, looking good!Shelves paintedFinished product!The top drawer is going to be used for note cards, stationery and pensSo, what do you think?  Is this Pinterest worthy?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, July 08, 2014", "text": "Nook VS Book Nook VS Kindle Nook VS Netbook ---- Do We Really Care?Ok, I will admit it.  For several years I have been having a love affair.  With technology.  It started when I got my first computer -- not the first computer in the house but MY first computer with internet access.  Of course there were the cell phones which I refused to have until I had one and now I can't imagine being \"disconnected\" without a phone.  I didn't have much interest in ipods and such as I am not a huge music person but I fell madly in love with e-readers.  The NOOK by Barnes and Noble to be exact.  I had looked at ipads but was told that since we don't run windows I wouldn't be able to use it.  Not really sure why but I accepted that answer.  I had looked at Kindle's and Samsung devices but when the NOOK came out I was in a comfortable place.  I bought the first one...the second one....the third one....and now I have had one of each version to come out.  The latest is the NOOK Glo-light because I wanted something light weight and lit so I could read in bed.  I also felt that having an e-reader would help me curb my book hoarding collecting as I was running out of bookcase space.  Do I use them?  Well, yes and no.  Right now \"no\" as I have a good number of physical books on my shelf that I would like to read so I am trying to get through them.  Will I ever finish?  I have no idea but I feel a purge coming on.  Do I read in bed?  Uh, no.  When I go to bed it is all I can do to stay awake before I get horizontal.  I don't think I am ever going to read in bed because if I get still and warm I go to sleep.So, then, why am I so aggravated that the NOOK part of the B&N business has been discontinued.  Why am I so put out that my collections of NOOKS will probably be completely obsolete by the end of the year when the business is gone and the \"cloud\" disappears.  I think I am aggravated because I got sucked into the whole thing.So, as I am mourning the probable expiration of the device, am I looking at a Kindle.  Not the Kindle fire but probably the Kindle Paperwhite -- just to read books.  I don't need it but it is sort of like the cell phone -- I can't picture myself without it.However, I this morning I discovered the Kindle Cloud Reader which you can use from a browser and you don't need a Kindle device.  I logged into my Amazon account, went to the cloud reader, downloaded a free book and voila! there it was for me to read.  So what would any sane person do-- I downloaded another!  So, I can actually have the same e-reader experience with my netbook.  The only downside is that I can't readily throw that into my purse. It is small --10\" -- so with a tote I could but it would be a little too heavy to carry around.  But, still -- I am just saying that I could satisfy my e-book attachment without having to actually having to go buy another device.  Apparently there is no Kindle app for NOOK --- very convenient that is.All of this sort of conflicts with my new minimalist mindset a bit.  I bought the e-reader(s) to reduce the number of books in my personal library but then I have too many NOOKS and I still buy physical books so that sort of didn't work.  I am still hoarding books -- just virtual ones -- because I have discovered BookBub where you can download free books each and every day.  Many of them that I wanted were only available for Amazon but now that I have learned about the Kindle Cloud, well, you see where this is going.As I become more minimally minded, I am discovering that I like my blog more and Facebook less.  I find that I am doing my household chores more \"old school\" and using fewer \"gadgets\". It seems like my fascination with technology is losing steam.  So, is it possible that the solution to the entire problem is just going to the library?"},

I think it has also spooked the animal community.Two days ago, near dusk, Hubs and I had just come in from our evening walk and as we stopped to glance out the back door Hubs spotted this sight --In our back garden was a family of raccoons - a mommy and three babies.  I realize this photo is difficult to see as it was taken through the door but there are three babies -- one on the run and two huddled by the tree.  If you click on the photo you might be able to see it better.  Mommy had already taken off -- bad mommy -- leaving your babies like that!  I have never seen anything cuter than baby raccoons -- trying to climb a tree, rolling around in the grass -- you just want to cuddle them.  Yes, I know, my mother always told me never to touch wild animals so I won't but.....Then, this morning I got up to this staring at me through the back door.A wild turkey!  I had seen them before in the street by the creek that runs beside our house but never in my yard.  It didn't seem to be particularly bothered by us.  Hubs even went out and took some photos and the bird didn't really care.  He finally flew up on the roof and took off into the neighbor's yard. I hope their dog doesn't hurt it but it is bigger than the dog so who knows.Anyway, I never have had very interesting photos of things in our yard and now I have two.  I think I will sit outside tonight with the camera and see what I can find to take pictures of.  Maybe the raccoons will come back or the turkey will fly in for a visit.I thought it was all very exciting but then, I am easily amused."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, June 18, 2014", "text": "And I Struggle OnThere are two words that do not come to mind when I think of myself -- graceful and stylish.  My mother always thought that my being born on a Tuesday (Tuesday's Child is Full of Grace) was some sort of a bad joke.  If it was there to fall over, I would fall over it.  If necessary, I would detour my route in order to fall over it.  It is sad but true. Then there is the stylish part.  When I was a child I dressed like a child of the 50's.  Lots of little plaid dresses with cardigans.  Shoes were generally saddle oxfords, Penny loafers or Mary Janes  It was easy.  The biggest problem was if the waistline hit at the right place and if there was droopy lace on one of your three petticoats.Being a teenager in the 1960's was fun -- Bobbie Brooks reigned supreme with all their  mix and match items.  There was always a pleated skirt, a straight skirt, an a-line skirt, a couple of blouses and a couple of sweaters -- one pull over and one cardigan in each line.  There were several color collections so for one stop shopping you could build an entire wardrobe and empty your parents wallets very quickly.  The shoes tended to be flats or loafers.  Soft crew socks were popular as well.  Easy peasy.Then came adulthood and I was lost.  I wore lots of homemade a-line skirts and sleeveless \"shells\" -- same thing as the sleeveless piece of a twin set.  And then there were the maternity clothes and the after-maternity clothes -- long blouses and elastic waists.  And.....here I am.  Trying to figure out, in my dotage, what in the world I am supposed to wear.  So, I read mags like \"Mary Jane's Farm\" which is no help in the clothing department but I know a lot about goats.  I read things like \"More\" from time to time but there isn't too much helpful info there either but I know a lot about Sybil Shepherd.  Yesterday I picked up a copy of \"Harper's Bazaar\" which had an article on \"no poo\" hair washing.  I thought I would pick up some fashion cues from that.  Well, in a word, no. I mean, yes, if I had unlimited income, was a size 0 and could lop about 40 years off my age.  So, I decided while I was out and about that I would just look at people -- no magazines, no websites, no minimalist articles telling me that I can actually live my entire life with only 10 articles of clothing.  I wanted to see something real.  So, I did some people watching.  It was enlightening.In the first place, I only saw two \"old girls\" out and about-- me and another woman who I assumed, from the age of the children that were with her, to be about my age.  I guess it was too hot for the truly aged to be out so I only had one example of a \"mature\" woman to draw from.  This is an example of what she was wearing --Blinged out denim caprisCoach toeBlue and Green TomGreen PoloHer hair was close cropped -- VERY close cropped and two different colors -- very blond on the top and very dark around the sides and back.  It reminded me of mine growing out from medication so I don't know if it was intentional or not.  She wore current eye glasses and some sort of earrings.I don't know what I thought about her attire.  It  looked fine, coordinated and put together except I wasn't sure of the bling on the butt.  My posterior is more ample that hers so my bling would be bigger -- not sure if I like it but I have to hand it to her for wearing it.  The polo and the shoes went well together and the tote was a nice nod to not being completely matchy matchy.  It didn't seem to be too young for her although younger women do wear these things.  She seemed comfortable.  However, it seems to be so -- ordinary! Even with the bling.  Maybe I am worrying too much or trying too hard.So, I went on a quest to determine the correct way to shop and build a wardrobe, minimalist or not.  I was trying to determine whether it is better to buy \"outfits\" -- like pants/skirts/blouses that match each other that you don't mix up with other things (I have several) or is it better to buy different pieces in neutral and mix and match.  I have no idea.  I might have to go back to my original plan of all black and white clothes.Would somebody help me please?  Only, I have no intention of having VERY close cropped hair.  Been there, done that and hope to never return.Into the GardenWe have spent the last several days tweaking the garden.  Due to the harsh winter we suffered some loss in the landscaping, mostly in the front and mostly the Hawthorne bushes.  So, we took one out of the front flower bed which left a gap.  We thought a great deal about what to put in the gap -- another shrub, a tree, perhaps, but we finally decided on this.Our house is relatively new construction, about 8 years old and is done in a French Country style.  I guess.  It looks pretty much like all new houses except that it has a turret which has caused more roofing problems that we were banking on but that is another conversation.  In any event, trying to decorate something \"French Country\" in Texas is difficult so we opted for this lovely Victorian style plant hanger.  Now, granted, Victorian isn't French Country either but it does lend an air of \"cozy\" to the front of the house.  The hanger itself is made from a 2\" fence post with brackets that were purchased separately.  Hubs sunk it in a concrete footing so it isn't going to go anywhere, I hope.  The brackets were ordered from a place online and the baskets were bought locally.  He has planted them with purslane which seems to do very well in our yard and something with a blue flower.  I like blue with the color of the brick so I needed something blue.   All in all I think it turned out quite well.  It filled the gap and adds some interest and I am pleased.The purslane in the blue pots by the gate has done very well, as it usually does.  I love walking out and seeing these happy flowers first thing in the morning.  We have two pots of it in the back as well which are just as prolific and they are so cheery -- you can't help but smile.  and finally, I added a little flag.  I love lighthouses and I am not sure why -- I have never lived near any water that had a lighthouse unless you count the tiny one at Woodlawn Lake in San Antonio and I never lived near it, really, either. So there you have a look at our front garden.  It is looking pretty good over all and I think my husband did a bang up job on the plant hanger.  That was #1 on my honey-do list for this summer so one down and two to go!  Will post more progress later. Have a wonderful Wednesday!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, May 31, 2014", "text": "Thursday ThoughtsIt has been quiet here the last few days.  The only thing of much interest was the End Of Year Pre-K 3 Program at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic School in Keller.  It was a lovely program of about a dozen little 3-4 year olds.  The first part of the program was a medley of patriotic tunes, the middle was a popular song that the children performed to with big flower headdresses and the last of the program was a slide show of photographs from throughout the year.  It was delightful and I cried.  Yes, I did.  I have a tendency to get weepy when it comes to milestones and this was definitely a milestone.  There was a lovely little reception afterward and here is our little songstress enjoying her refreshments. Other than that, all I have been doing is a lot of thinking.  As I have noted in prior posts, I am tending toward a minimalist approach to things and have been giving a lot of thought as to what needs to be eliminated in the house, condensed or re-evaluated. I will be spending the first couple of weeks in June going through a number of things beginning with clothes and accessories.  Books are always an issue here but we are adding two new bookcases to the furnishings.  However, I will still be sorting through and passing on a number of books.  I was thrilled to learn, this week, that the library we frequent accepts donations so that is where I will be taking my books.  I don't like selling them and I can't keep all of them so I think that is a worthy place for them to go.Another thing I have been thinking about is reading challenges.  I just love to read and don't really have enough time for it but I get it in snatches whenever I can.  I seem to always be distracted by what I \"need\" to be doing but I would love a day when I can just sit down with a good book and a cuppa and read without guilt -- possibly when I get through the books and the clothes.  That is what I am hoping.   But, back to book challenges.  I find that when I am involved in book challenges I don't enjoy the books as much.  It is like a race to meet a goal and I find that I can't get \"into\" the book as much.  So, while I am still going to add to the Goodreads 2014 Reading Challenge as I go, I don't think it is going to be a goal anymore.  I will continue to review and list my books on here but I don't think I am going to adhere to a challenge anymore. I have also been thinking about exercising.  I don't do enough of it but I am still wearing my pedometer to track my steps. However, this week I have done something a little different.  I have started doing some regular ol' exercise like sit-ups, leg lifts and toe touches, etc. after I have gotten up in the morning.  I find it easier to just do a few of these -- it doesn't take long -- first thing in the morning rather than wait until night because at night -- well, truthfully, it isn't going to happen.  I was also watching a Leslie Sansone walking video on YouTube the other day and was inspired.  I used to have her tapes, in fact, I probably still do -- I just don't have a VCR anymore.  However, her approach is to walk in place, almost like marching.  I have been doing that for the last couple of days while I am standing in the kitchen or waiting for the washer to stop or during commercials on tv and it has definitely upped my step count.  Finally, I did a bit of arm exercise with some cans of green beans.  It is amazing how you can get some exercise in without too much of an effort of expenditure of $$$$.  I have actually enjoyed the morning exercise -- I feel so accomplished.I have also been thinking about planners.  Everybody I know uses a planner.  I like the idea, I feel like I should use a planner and I WANT to use a planner.  The problem is, I don't have anything to plan.  Once you have your kids grown and your schedule changes, well, a planner is sort of unnecessary. Plus, the commercial versions never seem to work for my needs. However, I ran across this on Pinterest and decided it would be a fun project. http://charminglymodern.com/moleskine-notebook-turned-planner/So, I went to Barnes and Noble and bought the Moleskine -- a black, large, gridded model.  Then, I went to work.  I am not done by a long-shot but I think it is going to work. Basic Moleskine notebook, gridded, $18.95Monthly ViewWeekly ViewCloseup, albeit it blurry, weekly viewI started with January 2014 even though it has passed but I didn't add the weekly pages.  I started the weekly pages with June.  I intend to use the weekly pages for meal planning.  I think the reason that I can't stick with a planner is that they never seem to work for me -- the divisions are too small, they aren't flexible and there isn't any extra room for notes (and doodles, if you will).  So, I am thinking this might be the answer.  I am going to use metallic stars (I love gold stars) to denote birthdays and will maybe use stickers to emphasis other events like Christmas and Easter. I am going to use the weekly views for meal planning.  I keep looking for a way to do simple meal planning and I keep trying to use a different notebook, dry erase board, etc. and none of it works for me so I thought I would just do it here -- that it would be a good thing to have it all in one place in my purse.  I figure if I have coupons for products I will be using during any one week I can paper clip them here and just have them with me without so much fuss. Since there are a LOT of pages in these notebooks, I am planning on using some of the empty pages in the back to keep up with the books I am reading in series.  I have about three or four series going and I keep forgetting which books come next, which I have read and which I own so I thought this would be a good way to keep up with that as well.  I have these lists on my Nook but I find I don't like carrying the Nook with me all the time.I am not finished with it -- I have only gone to July.  I have ordered some index tabs to put on the monthly view so I can see the month easily.  They are on their way.  I am also planning on using this as somewhat of a diary as well -- making note of anything memorable that happens in a day.  I have never been very successful at journaling so maybe if it is here, in this one place, I will be able to at least attempt it.I will post more photos as I finish with it, with some pics of embellishments and such.  I haven't decided if I want to embellish the front cover or not -- I have a tendency to just throw things in a bag and am not particularly careful with stuff so it might get really wrecked -- I don't know, more thoughts later.So, anyway, that is what has been going on.  Not much but apparently enough to ramble about a little too much.Have a great weekend!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, May 26, 2014", "text": "Into the GardenYesterday was another day spent tweaking the garden.  We live in a garden home but our yard is as large as it was in our former, traditional house.  We live on a wedge shaped lot which creates a lot of back and side yard but not much front yard.  We are fortunate that we do not have to maintain the yards, that is done through our HOA dues and the yards, front and back, are mowed and trimmed once a week.  That was one of the attractions of living here because my husband doesn't mind gardening but mowing is not his activity of choice.  We do have to maintain our flower beds ourselves, however.  When the subdivision was built, the landscaper that the builder used put in lots of beautiful plants.  It was gorgeous when they were all small but as they grew, many of them were just too large for the space in which they were placed.  Plus, the houses on this end of the subdivision were built on solid rock and the soil depth isn't, well, deep so lots of things have been lost.  The one thing we can't get rid of is the bermuda grass that keeps coming up in one of the front flower beds. We are working on that but refuse to do anything with those beds until the grass is gone.Anyway, yesterday was the day to tackle the front flower bed.  We lost a Hawthorn bush that needed to be removed.  The Creeping Charlie wasn't creeping very well, in fact, it looked like it had crawled to it's death and the whole thing just needed to be raked out.  We decided that once Charlie was gone and the bush was no more, we would just add a bunch of Skullcap.  It has done well everywhere we have put it and I thought it would lend itself to the \"unmanicured\" look I prefer.  I also thought it would complement the Dianthus.  At the end of today, we will probably be moving a couple of the plants around to make room for a deep purple Crepe Myrtle to break up the expanse of house wall.  So, what do you think?plants going in -- bed still looks a little roughmy husband loves to use jigs so he devised a way to measure for each plant to get them spaced correctly as they went around a curvelooking betterAfter the planting and the addition of mulch and Bernard Bunnyfrom the driveway -- nice play off the Dianthusan update on the growth progress of the purslane in the blue potsand the other potThe day was humid in the morning and progressed to being very hot but at the end, after the planting and mulching, we had a lovely rain that resulted in this stellar rainbow.  Isn't it lovely?so vibrantit was so large you could see both ends -- just no pot of gold!this was when it first appearedFriday at Homestead Farms or You Ain't Been Kissed 'til You've Been Kissed by a Goat!This past Friday was a fun day to visit Homestead Farms in Keller, Texas.  It was story time and craft day and what a beautiful day it was for it.  The Farris family runs such a delightful operation there at Homestead Farms and it was just made all the better with the addition of Meredith Lyons from Barefoot Books.  Miss Meredith read a very appropriate story -- The Little Red Hen -- positioned right in front of the hen house.  After the story, the kiddos were invited to participate in a craft -- making their own \"little red hen\".  The piece de resistance was the pen of baby goats just waiting to be petted.  I know my granddaughter's one wish was to be able to pet a goat and that she did.  I think she could have stayed there all afternoon just playing with them and I have to say they loved it as well.  One of the larger baby goats was very friendly and very affectionate.  After a lengthy head-patting session I think it just wanted to return the affection and gave my granddaughter a big lick on the arm.  There was surprise all around -- granddaughter jumped and when she jumped so did the goat.  Guess their ain't no kiss like a goat kiss!  The visit wouldn't be complete without a visit to the Homestead Farms Store where we bought some more of their fantastic tamales, pork chops and the biggest yellow squash you have ever seen.  I wish I had taken a photo of it but I came home and cooked it up immediately.  It was superb!  I will be checking for more this Friday. So, here are some photos from the day and contact information for Miss Meredith.  She was delightful, the turnout was fantastic and the kids just all had a wonderful time.The crops have grown tremendously since our last visitThe baby goats Baby goat, goat, goat goat, Baby goatRight after THE KISS!These chickens were just tiny, fuzzy yellow chicks at the last visit!

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, May 21, 2014", "text": "Organics, Organics, OrganicsAs I have posted here in the past, I have been on a journey to do things in a more natural, healthy way.  I started on this quest a couple of years ago, maybe a bit longer, and I don't see it stopping anytime soon.  I can't tell you when it started exactly but it was a slow start -- I have made changes in a very slow way.  I have tried commercial products as well as DIY products. In addition to making an effort to be healthier in my lifestyle, I am also trying to be more frugal.  I know that the choices I make in what we use and how much I pay for it will ultimately affect our quality of life.  So, it is a balancing act to do the best I can for us and not break the bank.  So, when I have tried products that don't fill my bill I really have a problem throwing them away.  If they are only marginally bad, I tend to use them up an make a note not to buy them again.  If they are really terrible, I just toss them but I try very hard to use it enough to give it a chance before I pass judgement.  I have found excellent products and not so excellent products in all product lines whether they are natural, organic or just regular stuff.I like a lot of my DIY products -- mostly my homemade laundry soap.  I much prefer it to commercial laundry detergents.  It doesn't bother my skin and I like the smell of it depending on what soap I use.  I recently bought a new mop -- a Rubbermaid Reveal mopping system.I bought this because I don't like Swiffers.  I don't like the cleanser, I don't like that you throw everything away and they don't feel very sturdy.  This mop is great -- it comes with a microfiber pad that can be machine washed and a refillable bottle that I can use whatever cleaner I want.  I got a good deal, though, because mine came with two bottles and three pads. I was recently looking for an all purpose cleaners to use around the house that didn't use vinegar.  I have a lot of granite and vinegar isn't good for it so I was searching for an alternative.  I found a really easy recipe that calls for water, rubbing alcohol, a couple of drops of dishwashing soap and some essential oil if you desire.  I made up two batches, put it in spray bottles and put one in each bathroom with a roll of paper towels.  It works great to just quickly swish the bathroom in the morning while I am getting ready.  It doesn't smell like alcohol and it doesn't smell like the sweet orange essential oil I used so it works well for me.  Up to now I have just mopped with water in my new mop but I intend to use this same mixture for my floors.  I think it will be just perfect.My quest for natural products hasn't just involved household products.  I am adamant about not using chemicals on my person.  That is one of the hardest things to change, especially if you have dry skin.  As I have mentioned previously, I have changed almost everything about what I use.  I now use a line of makeup called Rejuva -- available online.  I finally completed my makeup bag with a small size of their new pressed foundation and a lip gloss called Cherry Splash.  It is SCARY red but it is really so pretty on -- not bright and garish and it isn't sticky.  I wish I had bought it first but I also recently bought a tube of NARS dolce vita lipstick and, while I love the color and the feel, I feel like I am putting poison on my body.  Not a good feeling.  I have been really happy with the Rejuva line and haven't really been tempted to try something new.As my hair is returning from the chemo treatments, my chemo curls are showing up really nicely and I love them!  I know that my hair is still coming in, even though I have quite a bit, because it still itches! Very strange, I know.  I also know that my hair is fragile so I am doing a lot to keep it healthy and undamaged.  What does that mean?  That means I am washing it one day a week with my J.R. Liggett shampoo and with just water in between.  As suggested by my doctor's nurse, I am brushing it with a natural bristle hairbrush.  I am not using product of any sort.  I probably never will.  The texture is completely different and the curls are something I am not used to.  My new routine seems to be working nicely, though, because even though I have had gray hair for a very long time, it has never had the shine that it has now so I am thinking my new routine is very good for my hair. Now, this is where we get to the TMI part so, if you are squeamish, you might want to stop reading here.  I have very dry skin and love Dr. Bronner's soap but I have noticed that it is making me drier.  So, I did a little reading and discovered that, unless you have been working under a car, running in a marathon, playing in the dirt, etc. you don't have to use soap to get clean.  I even discussed this with my microbiologist husband and he confirmed what the articles said.  So, I have quit using soap.  I shower every day, sometimes twice, and I don't just let the water wash over me.  I scrub.  I use a washrag and I scrub.  If I really feel the need I will use soap in the strategic areas but for the most part, I am soap free.  My skin is just looking better and better.  And, nobody has complained to me about being stinky.I also quit using commercial deodorants including the better known \"natural\" products.  The crystal ones made me itch and the natural varieties smelled funky to me.   So, I concocted my own.  I use a small amount of coconut oil and rub it in very well, completely, and then powder with a mixture of baking soda and cornstarch, heavy on the cornstarch. I am very pleased with the results. I was walking through Central Market today and spotted a new product and I am a sucker for new products if they have ingredients that I can pronounce and understand.  As I was talking to one of the ladies that works in the health and wellness department I very quietly explained my hygiene routine and she totally agreed with me and noticed that I picked up this ~I was assured it was an outstanding product and I could read and understand all the ingredients.  I also picked up this ~I am anxious to try this because of the ingredients -- the main ingredient is coconut oil and it also contains cornstarch.  It will be much easier to travel with than a tiny jar of coconut oil and a parmesan shaker of my homemade powder.  I haven't tried it yet for efficacy but I hope it works.  If it doesn't, I know that my DIY version works well and makes me feel good that I am not putting chemicals on my body.So, I think I have done a good job of balancing frugality with healthy with these products.  I have managed to narrow down products, whether DIY or commercially produced, and don't really have the desire to keep trying things out.  Being more minimally minded these days, I like the idea of just having a few products that work well for me, are affordable, easily attainable and simple.  By making a few of my own things, I don't feel bad about buying some of the more expensive products that I can't make myself.  I have also been more open minded about things -- realizing that I can buy Rejuva Minerals cosmetics for a lot less than I can buy mainstream products, they are healthier and just work well.  I realize that by adding some rubbing alcohol to water I can make a perfectly acceptable cleaning product that I feel safe using and safe having around.  I can make it up as I go and not have to store a lot of cleaning products.  I feel very satisfied employing these new ideas in my life.  I just wish I had thought this way when I was younger!!"},

Yes, I know, I could move the books off the end table.  That would help, too.  I have learned that clutter doesn't equal \"cozy and lived in\" -- it just equals mess.I have also been reading.  I am currently reading \"The Master Quilter\" by Jennifer Chiaverini.    It is the sixth book in the Elm Creek Quilts series.  It is different than the others I have read so far in that each character has a story and they all come together at one moment in time.  I have read about these characters through five other books and I have gotten to \"know\" them.  I am worried about Bonnie - she is having such a struggle with her ogre of a husband.  Judy is struggling with a job change and Diane is going to be facing a job loss as well as learning that her son is teetering on the edge of criminal activity.  Gwen is getting over the disappointment of being passed over for a job she wanted and deserved.  These characters have become real to me and I can't wait to see how it all works out for them.  I am almost finished with this episode and I am hating to see it end.So, that is what the week has held for me.  This week -- who knows?  For some reason I have been very thoughtful lately.  I have no idea why but I get this way from time to time.  I don't know if it is sadness or a slight bit of depression but I prefer to think of it as thoughtful.  There are so many things I have been interested in over my life time that I have always put on the back burner.  For some reason, now, I have the urge to do them.  I want to draw, I want to write, I want to sew, I want to read -- there are not enough hours in the day but I am trying.Maybe this week I will be able to sandwich in a bit more blogging!Oh, BTW, the movie was great! A chick flick for sure but even for us old chicks.  I recommend!"},

It is really sort of amazing how a short drive down a driveway and suddenly you have left a busy street with a lot of businesses and you are smack in the middle of the country.  It was great.I took quite a few photos and I think they will tell the story of Homestead Farms far better than I can.

That is another post.However, as we were standing in line at the LIBRARY I noticed a lovely mystery book on one of the display shelves close by.  It is \"Death Comes to the Village\" by Catherine Lloyd.  Being the sucker for covers that I am, I snatched it up and brought it home.  It is the first time, in a very long time, that I have checked out a library book for myself and I was surprised at the exhilaration that came over me -- just like when I was a kid.  The library was one of my favorite places and I could lose myself there for hours and that was exactly how I felt this time.I brought home one book that grabbed my attention, not a stack of random reads off a sale table.  I was excited to read this one book, not just put it on the shelf for \"someday\".  It brought back many great childhood memories.  I didn't realize that just one borrowed book could do that.So, my thought of the day is that maybe it is a good thing that the B&N near me closed.  I have often said that the library is under utilized, under respected and should be protected. Maybe I need to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem.  The library near my house is a short car ride away, much closer than B&N, maybe I should be going there instead.  I sure did like the way it felt."},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, April 27, 2014", "text": "Bored, Bored, Bored!!!!About 8 years ago the Hubs and I moved to a newly constructed house in a subdivision that is gated and geared for empty nesters with the added perk that we don't have to \"do\" the lawn -- it is done by the HOA.  Of course, we pay for it but we don't have a choice, it just happens.So, I was thrilled.  No yard to do, just flower beds to putter in.  The house is big enough but not too big, although I would like another bedroom.  This was my first \"new\" house and I figured I would be a happy little camper here forever.  When we moved we got rid of some furniture, bought some new furniture, we relished in the fact that there was hardly any carpet which we don't care for and I was set.  Or so I thought.Hubs and I were always DIY-ers with little projects going on.  Here we are in a new house with nothing to do.  I guess we will have to think about painting in a couple of years but that isn't want I mean.  I like the idea of putting things together and now it is \"done\" and I miss projects.So, since there are no walls to knock down or porches to close in, I have to come up with something so I am looking at changing some of the furniture.  At this point, Hubs isn't talking about it.  However, the fact of the matter is, I am tired of brown.  We have Craftsman Style furniture that is made by the Amish.  It is very well built, solid cherry and leather covered.  In brown leather.  All brown.The end tables are brown.  The coffee table is brown.  It just looks like a big brown blob. The chairs, there are two, are quite comfortable except that they are too big for me and when I sit in mine, my feet don't touch the ground.  I have solved that with a small footstool.  The couch, however, has to be the most uncomfortable thing on the planet.  The seats are too shallow, the backs are too straight and stiff and you can't lean up against the arm of the sofa without a pillow because the arm cuts into your side.  The one redeeming quality is that it sleeps great.It is lovely furniture but what I would like to do is keep the chairs and replace the sofa with this -- It is a loveseat which would be shorter than the sofa we have now but I think that would be ok.  It is a cream colored twill slipcover with triple padded seats and arms.  I think it looks luscious.We also have travertine floors with no rugs and my husband absolutely hates throw pillows so it all seems stark and hard-surfaced to me.  I would like a little softness.  I doubt I can negotiate a rug but I am thinking I might be able to swing the sofa but I hate to get rid of the current one.  It is such pretty wood and the leather is nice but everything                                                                                                       is                                                         so                                                               BROWN!

Favorite?  April 24, 2014Filed under: Wordpress — --Deb @ 6:31 am  Do you have a favorite book? What do you say when people ask you? (This question always flummoxes me because how can you pick just one, so I’m eager to hear what you folks have to say.)And, has your favorite book changed over the years?? Actually, no, I can't say that I do.  I have favorite authors however -- Jan Karon, MC Beaton, Nancy Atherton, Barbara Taylor Bradford, Dorothea Benton Frank just to name a few.  I haven't read anything by any of these women that I haven't liked and would recommend anything by any of them and that is what I tell people when they ask.So, what have I been doing that has taken me away from my bookish memes this week? I have been working on a picture album.  My photos are very unorganized -- I wouldn't even use the word organized in any way when speaking of them.  They are in boxes, albums, in piles in the closet -- they are a hot mess. So, I decided to do something about them.  I am most concerned about the really old photos.  They have been through a lot, glued into albums, pried out of the albums, they survived a fire -- they are in rough shape and I don't want them to get any worse.However, I hate scrapbooking.  I have tried it and I have never found any joy in it.  It is expensive, requiring LOTS of cute stuff and messy.  I have done many scrapbooking pages using original photos and then regretted it when I wanted to share the photos or use them in another way and couldn't get them off the page. So, I decided to something different.  I had seen some vintage albums in antique stores and like the way they were done so that is what I sat out to do.I purchased a very nice, large photo albumI purchased old-fashioned photo cornersAdd some black scrapbooking paper to itThese lovely Gelly Roll pens in white work great on black paperAnd here is a really bad photo of one finished page.I am leaving enough space so that I can label each photo with genealogical information for my children and grandchildren.  Lots of writing and dates and background information -- it is really quite fun.So, this last week has been spent finding the photos, organizing the photos, arranging and afixing the photos and labeling the photos.  Am I done?  Oh no, not even close but I have started and that is good."},

To reduce the number of physical books?  Ugh.I have come to the conclusion that there is no help for people like me, no solution.  I just have to accept myself as I am, a weak individual, a wimp, when it comes to printed material.  It is part of who I am, right?  Is it really so bad, though?  I could have a weak desire for other things much worse, right?  Designer handbags or shoes.  Jewelry, Yachts and houses in the Hamptons?  Ok, not quite the same thing but you see what I mean -- having too many books, too little space to put them and not enough time to read them is hardly the worst of the problems that I could have.  So I guess it isn't such a terrible affliction after all.   I mean, too many books could be useful -- to share with others, to use as decoration, to prop up table legs -- or to keep me current, to keep my mind sharp and to give me something to fill the hours and take me to places/situations that I would never dream of being.  Such a wonderful escape -- books.  Yes, I don't think I feel bad at all about my lack of control in procuring books of any sort -- physical or virtual.   They bring such pleasure -- if even just looking at the cover art.   What have I learned from this?  That if I talk to myself long enough, I just justify almost anything!"},

Frank Baum. Apparently the Oz books were her favorites growing up. I remember her reading the book to me in the afternoon and I could just picture the characters and the scenery.  It was a good time and something I tried to repeat with my own children--they were great fans of the Bunnicula books.Now I have the privilege of caring for my youngest grandchild -- the loveable Bean.  Now that nap times are quickly becoming a thing of the past but rest is still needed, I decided to return to the scheme my mother began with me.  Tomorrow we will start reading The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. I went to B&N a couple of days ago and purchased a leather bound, hard back copy for her personal library. B&N has a lovely collection of classics for children, reprints of older editions and I think it would make a lovely series to collect.  When we get finished with Oz, we might move on to Peter Pan or Alice in Wonderland although I get a bit itchy with Alice long around Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum time.  So, tomorrow we will be taking flight on a cyclone and visiting Munchkinland and getting to know all the characters.  I am anxious to see how Bean does -- if she has the patience to stay with it or if her 3-year-oldness takes over.  At any rate, I am sure I will enjoy it."},

{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, April 05, 2014", "text": "Random Rant aka Meal Planning BlogI don't care for cooking.  I like my own cooking better than anything else but my husband isn't a fan.  Due to lots of circumstances, we have taken to eating out almost every night and it is spoiling my husband for restaurant food and I am getting tired of it.  So, I have been giving a lot of thought to both of these situations and have come to a couple of conclusions.First, my husband needs to get over it.  He is diabetic.  The restaurant food isn't good for him.  He has been eating my food for almost 42 years.  Zip it, Hubs and sit down and eat.  Plus, I just have to accept the fact that he is never going to enjoy broccolli.  Second, I need to get a grip and face the resident evil head on.  When I think about meal planning I morph back into Home Ec at Mark Twain Junior High School.  I think \"meat, a starch, two veggies and fruit\".  I try to plan meals around that paradigm and therein lies the problem -- we just don't eat like that anymore.  I can make a mean roast with potatoes and carrots but that generates leftovers -- Hubs won't eat leftovers.  I blame that on living with his mother who actually cooks for leftovers -- a weeks worth of yellow squash.  I can see the problem.  He doesn't care for fish and he isn't a a fan of chicken, especially boneless, skinless chicken breasts that come in large bags with several pieces --you know the ones, you get them in the freezer section at the store.  Yep.  Not his thing.He says I need to plan meals which is great except he can't tell me anything to put on the list.  I thought about why we can't plan a weeks worth of meals and it dawned on me that I am planning meals which are fine but they aren't what we eat.  If I want to plan meals, I need to look at what we actually eat.Ok, so here is what I want to do -- I want to plan meals for home, that I cook, like the ones we eat out.  There, I have said it.  I think this is the only way I am going to solve the issue.  If I do that then maybe we can quit asking each other \" what do you want to eat\" -- and I will spend less money at the store because half of what I buy we don't want to eat.  I am trying to be good about it but I think I have to face the fact that our eating habits aren't great but maybe I could make it better by doing it at home but in the same vein as what we eat out.  Maybe I am just bored.So, I sat about trying to figure out the best way to plan the meals which was going to result in the purchase of a notebook, page protectors, paper and the time to pour over books, magazines, etc.Then I ditched that idea.  I have a little white board on the side of my fridge with a section divided off for each day.  I am assigning a \"theme\" to each day - i.e.  if you ever went to public school in Texas and ate in the cafeteria, you ate Mexican food.  Since that was our life for twelve years, we are stuck in the \"if it's Wednesday, you eat Mexican food\" mindset.  So, Wednesday will be Mexican food day.  See where I am going with this?Then, I am going to have to figure out what I can do in the crockpot as we are gone every day of the week and what I can cook ahead and freeze, if I need to.  Bread, cornbread, biscuits, etc. come to mnd.  I am thinking about making a tossed salad at the beginning of the week for several days or as long as I can keep it fresh and then fill in with REALLY simple food. (Steamed yellow squash?) I think I can do it.So, that is what has been playing in my mind for the last 48 hours.  I don't like to cook but I don't think I like to eat out so much anymore either.  It has become a chore in and of itself.  Besides, I like my own cooking such as it is.I have to ask -- how do you eat?  How do you plan?  I need hints and tips!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, March 30, 2014", "text": "Growing Up or Growing Old?I have been reading a good deal of minimalist blogs and articles lately and I am having a change of mind about things.  An epiphany, so to speak.  This great revelation?  I hate clutter.   I REALLY hate clutter.  The thing is -- what, exactly, IS clutter? I have had a creative streak all my life.  From the time I was little and begged Granny Schmidt (my OTHER grandmother, actually no relation) to teach me to make pot holders on a little loom from the five and dime, I have had my hands in some sort of crafty endeavor.  However, crafty endeavors usually involve space and mess. It used to not bother me.  I could sew with a baby on my lap or cross stitch with kids on either side of me making a mess of the thread.  I could leave it there to pick up again in the next ten minutes or the next month and it never bothered me.  Now, not so much.I don't have a lot of time to get involved in crafty things anymore and honestly, I don't have a lot of interest anymore either.  It seems like the enjoyment is overshadowed by the mess.  I don't have a dedicated sewing room -- and don't really want one because I am afraid it would make me crazy if it wasn't cleaned up and everything put away all the time.  It seems like my life is just taking a different turn.I have been doing a lot of thinking about what I think would make me happy at this point in my life.  The first thing that I see when I close my eyes is a clean house.  I don't mean just dusted, vacuumed and mopped -- I mean every flat surface empty.  I can see having what I need and no more and all those things in their place. When I think about all the crafting things stashed in drawers and cabinets and closets I feel my skin crawling.  I spent the better part of the weekend going through and throwing away magazines and I was almost physically ill because to me it seemed I was throwing away money but the truth of the matter is, we have no more room to store magazines.  Pure and simple.  The dust the emanated from the piles sent my allergic response into a tail spin so those piles of mags were literally making me sick.  I finally just threw everything away. The second thing I see is taking care of myself.  Less stress for one thing.  For some reason I feel like I SHOULD be doing all these crafty things, that I should WANT to do them but I don't. That causes me stress because I feel like I am not doing something I should be doing. What do I want to do?  I want to get my hair done and polish my toenails.  I want to take walks and sit on the patio and watch the birds.  I want to read wonderful books and go to bed early in a clean, uncluttered, undusty bedroom.  I want to walk in my bathroom and see a clean vanity with NOTHING on it.   I want my world to be calm and quiet.I don't know if something is wrong with me, if I am just getting old or maybe just growing up.  I don't know if I am finally looking at my life through my eyes at what I want rather than what other people want me to do or what I think I should do in comparison to other people.  Maybe I am just becoming true to myself.  Maybe there are just not enough hours in a day and I am having to prioritize.  I think that is what it is.  I am having to decide what is the most important way to spend my time, what things do I find enjoyable and what environment makes me the most comfortable.  Maybe I have learned I can't do it all and truthfully don't want to. Maybe I have learned that less is more.  The answer to the initial question -- what is clutter?  In my eyes, clutter is anything that isn't used, beautiful, loved and doesn't have a place. Clutter is anything that saps your energy or creates anxiety (NOT children -- children aren't clutter!).  There are all sorts of clutter -- paper, supplies, books, magazines, noise, decor, color -- whatever creates chaos in your existence. The eight bottles of extremely dated, stinky cologne that I won't throw out because they were gifts comes immediately to mind.Now that I have identified clutter -- the trick is to get rid of it in a timely manner sans guilt.  Yes, that is a trick.  I don't think a person should feel guilty over inanimate objects like fabric or scrapbooking supplies.  My problem is that I see these things as money -- they cost money so to throw them away or give them away is the same is throwing away money.  I have to get past that.  Maybe donating them would be helpful.  However, whatever it takes is what I will do because I need to set about creating this new environment and way of life for myself.  I don't want to feel guilty over passing along some sewing stuff.  What I want is to feel like  I don't have to practically renovate the house for somebody to walk in the front door.  It is more important to me to have a clean, welcoming home than to have copious amounts of stuff around me taking up precious real estate in closets and drawers.  There, I said it.  That is what I want.  I want the things and activities that are important to me and I want to get rid of all the junk.So, am I growing old or growing up?Stream of ConsciousnessI was looking for a new meme for Sunday and ran across this one at allthingsfadra.com.  The idea is to set a timer and write for five minutes, whatever comes into your head, whatever you are thinking about -- possibly even word association, I would suppose.  So, for the next five minutes I am going to give it a go.  One, two, three -- go.Do you believe in genetic memory?  From what I understand, genetic memory is memory(ies) that is passed on to you through your DNA -- memories of your parents, grandparents, etc.  I think the idea is completely bizarre except for the dream.  Yes, I have always had a recurring dream -- well, not always -- it started when I was a child and continued until I went on a quest to find the house. I found the house and never had the dream again.In the dream I am standing behind an old high school near downtown. Like most of the buildings of it's era it was imposing and elaborate.  It was the only high school in town for a long time -- the first high school, if you will.  I was on the street behind it looking at a house.  I was in current time but the house was not-- it was almost like a split screen on a tv program but part of it was very foggy -- like an old sepia photo -- and there was a wagon with a horse attached sitting in front on the street. I knew this house, it was familiar, I knew who was in the house.....I woke up.Ok, my five minutes are up.  That is what I woke up thinking about this morning.  I don't know why, I haven't thought about it for a long time.  Maybe it is because I am planning a summer return to my hometown and that is where this house is.  Every time I go I try to see the house -- one day I am sure I will go and it won't be there.  I will be sad because this house draws me in -- not in a bad way -- and I need to know the connection.  Ah, genealogy -- there is never an end to it."},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, March 29, 2014", "text": "The Great Gatsby by F. Scott FitzgeraldIn a recent Facebook conversation with some younger folks, the subject of required reading in school came up.  The youngsters were discussing what they were required to read and The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald was mentioned.  When I responded that I had never read the book shouts of horror reached the heavens.  I further explained that it wasn't required.  More shouts.  In my defense, I threw out titles like Beowulf and Canterbury Tales but that did not impress.  Somehow, because I had not read The Great Gatsby my education was in question.  So.......I stopped by my neighborhood Half Price Books and picked up a copy and read it.  Now I don't have to be ashamed of my lesser education -- I have been duly instructed in the writing style of Fitzgerald.F. Scott Fitzgerald, born in 1896 (the year of my grandfather's birth) in Minnesota.  He attended Princeton University and published his first novel in 1920.  He married Zelda Sayre and lived between New York, Paris and the French Riviera.  He was part of the expatriate group including Gertrude Stein and Ernest Hemingway. He went on to write such masterpieces as The Beautiful and the Damned  and Tender is the Night.   He died in 1940 of a heart attack.  Fitzgerald is acknowledged to be one of the most important American writers of the twentieth century.I enjoyed the book a great deal but honestly, I feel like I have read it before.  I know I haven't seen any of the movie versions but it seems hauntingly familiar to me.  The setting in this book was lush.  I was taken back to an era that I have only read about -- the jazz age.  I could envision the extravagance of Gatsby's lifestyle, the alcohol, the dresses, the lifestyle of the rich and famous of the 1920's.  I could almost feel the cool breeze blowing across the patio and the party goers broke into their intimate groups.  I could see Gatsby standing at the top of the steps surveying his world -- the world he built for Daisy.From the beginning I thought the character of Gatsby to be sad.  With all his wealth and opulent lifestyle, he seemed to be the loneliest, most insecure man on the earth.  I disliked Tom immediately and I felt that Daisy wasn't what she appeared to be.  Jordan seemed to be cool, level headed and not willing to put herself on the line for anybody.   The story is told from the viewpoint of Nick Carraway.  While he seemed to be curious and somewhat awed about Gatsby and his life he was also frustrated by it all.  He was caught up, for three months, in Gatsby's world but he never really became a part of it.  It seemed that Carraway was the most grounded of all the characters.The plot progressed nicely.  I really enjoyed the interaction between characters -- it was a good window into interpersonal relationships and mores of the time.  As was noted by the New York Times \"gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession\" as was evidenced in this work.  Yet, while life had a definite wild side, there was still a decorum to be upheld.  The reader knows what is going on the book -- read between the lines -- but it is never overtly discussed -- it is assumed.  The book flows well an it is difficult to put down.  It is a short read and goes quickly.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it.There -- I feel like I have just written a book report and I guess I have.  Now, I just might watch the movie."},

So, I will jump right in.I have just finished reading \"The Quilter's Legacy\" by Jennifer Chiaverini.  This is the fifth of the Elm Creek Quilt series that I have read and it was delightful.  All of Chiaverini's books contain a bit of history, a bit of quilting and a bit of mystery.  It is a perfect combination.  I have already started another book but when it is done (it is very short) I will begin the next in the Elm Creek Quilter's series -- \"The Master Quilter\".  I am currently reading \"The Great Gatsby\".  Why have I chosen this book, you might ask?  Well, I joined in on a conversation on Facebook about books read in high school and my much younger counterparts thought it was ridiculous that I hadn't been required to read this work.  I suddenly felt that my education was somehow lacking and so I went to the bookstore and bought a copy.  I did remind them, however, that MY required reading involved works like \"Beowulf\".  So, there, youngsters, let's compare educations if you must.   That, clearly, brings me to my current read which is \"The Great Gatsby\".  So far so good.  I will let you know when I am done.  I guess I will have to start another Facebook conversation about this book to see what the \"youngsters\" thought about it, reading it in high school.  I am sure that when I was in high school I would have found it boring.  I think. Probably better than \"Beowulf\" however.I went to Barnes and Noble the other night just to have some place to go (pathetic, isn't it) and I happened across two books that I felt compelled to pick up.  The first -- well, what can I say -- caught my eye because it is a classic and I don't feel that I have read enough classics and the cover -- oh yes, the cover.Also, I snatched up \"A Place at the Table\" by Susan Rebecca White.  The cover wasn't outstanding but the synopsis appealed to me so it will be on my soon-TBR list.The book that I am waiting rather impatiently for is \"Somewhere Safe with Somebody Good\" by Jan Karon.  Even though Karon thought she was done with the Mitford series and progressed on to the Father Tim series, I guess she discovered there was more of Mitford to tell so her new book is a continuation of the Mitford Series and I couldn't be more thrilled.  I have read, and own, all of her books and I love them.  I can sit down with one of them and no longer be in Fort Worth, Texas but rather Mitford, North Carolina and be totally engrossed.  I can't wait for this new book. What a wonderful fall read it will be!!So, there you have it for my Musing Monday. Happy St. Patrick's Day!  Happy St. Patrick's Day!From Catholic Online we learn this about our beloved St. Patrick-- St. Patrick of Ireland is one of the world's most popular saints.  Apostle of Ireland, born at Kilpatrick, near Dumbarton, in Scotland, in the year 387; died at Saul, Downpatrick, Ireland, 17 March, 461.Along with St. Nicholas and St. Valentine, the secular world shares our love of these saints. This is also a day when everyone's Irish.     There are many legends and stories of St. Patrick, but this is his story.     Patrick was born around 385 in Scotland, probably Kilpatrick. His parents were Calpurnius and Conchessa, who were Romans living in Britian in charge of the colonies.     As a boy of fourteen or so, he was captured during a raiding party and taken to Ireland as a slave to herd and tend sheep. Ireland at this time was a land of Druids and pagans. He learned the language and practices of the people who held him.     During his captivity, he turned to God in prayer. He wrote      \"The love of God and his fear grew in me more and more, as did the faith, and my soul was rosed, so that, in a single day, I have said as many as a hundred prayers and in the night, nearly the same.\"  \"I prayed in the woods and on the mountain, even before dawn. I felt no hurt from the snow or ice or rain.\"      Patrick's captivity lasted until he was twenty, when he escaped after having a dream from God in which he was told to leave Ireland by going to the coast. There he found some sailors who took him back to Britian, where he reunited with his family.     He had another dream in which the people of Ireland were calling out to him \"We beg you, holy youth, to come and walk among us once more.\"     He began his studies for the priesthood. He was ordained by St. Germanus, the Bishop of Auxerre, whom he had studied under for years.     Later, Patrick was ordained a bishop, and was sent to take the Gospel to Ireland. He arrived in Ireland March 25, 433, at Slane. One legend says that he met a chieftain of one of the tribes, who tried to kill Patrick. Patrick converted Dichu (the chieftain) after he was unable to move his arm until he became friendly to Patrick.     Patrick began preaching the Gospel throughout Ireland, converting many. He and his disciples preached and converted thousands and began building churches all over the country. Kings, their families, and entire kingdoms converted to Christianity when hearing Patrick's message.     Patrick by now had many disciples, among them Beningnus, Auxilius, Iserninus, and Fiaac, (all later canonized as well).     Patrick preached and converted all of Ireland for 40 years. He worked many miracles and wrote of his love for God in Confessions. After years of living in poverty, traveling and enduring much suffering he died March 17, 461.     He died at Saul, where he had built the first church.    Why a shamrock?   Patrick used the shamrock to explain the Trinity, and has been associated with him and the Irish since that time.    In His Footsteps:   Patrick was a humble, pious, gentle man, whose love and total devotion to and trust in God should be a shining example to each of us. He feared nothing, not even death, so complete was his trust in God, and of the importance of his mission.And yes, I have quite a bit of Irish heritage.  I talk mostly about being Welsh but I am as much Irish and am currently trying to learn more about my \"Irishness\". Meet my great-grandfather, Henry Patrick Conn -- he is only one of my relations that bears an Irish name. Even though he was born in the United States I think his attire looks a bit Irish, don't you?  The hat?  In any event, I am proud of my Irish heritage and even though I identify with my Welsh ancestry more, I am learning and forging a kinship with my Irish clan and am proud to be a part of it.Erin Go Bragh!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, March 13, 2014", "text": "Voila -- And Then There Was Bread!Do not use this pan.  Trust me on this.Earlier today I posted on Facebook about not liking commercially made bread anymore.  I have been making our bread for the last several weeks because all I taste are chemicals when I eat the ready made stuff.  So, I tried several recipes and found one I liked, made an adjustment or two and have my go-to recipe.  A couple of people have asked me to post the recipe but rather than doing it on FB, I am doing it here because I feel like I have more room to ramble.So, anyway, this is the recipe I have titled Melissa's Easy White Bread #2.  It is #2 because it was my second attempt with changes.  So, here goes.3/4 cup warm water1 pkg. yeast (or 3 tsp. if you are using it out of a jar)1 tsp salt1 1/2 Tbs. sugar1 Tbs. melted butter1/2 cup milk3 cups all purpose flour (I thought it came out better when I used organic all purpose flour.)1.  In a large bowl add warm water and yeast.  Stir until yeast is dissolved.2.  Add sugar, butter and milk to the bowl of yeast and stir.3.  Mix in first 2 cups of flour and salt.4.  If needed, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time until dough chases spoon around bowl.5.  Turn dough out on a floured board and knead adding small spoonfuls of flour as needed.6.  Put it in an oiled bowl to rise -- about an hour.7.  Punch down, knead again on floured board, shape into a loaf.  Spray pan with Pam (or something like it) lightly.  Put the dough into the pan and let it rise again -- about an hour.8.  Bake at 375 for 30-45 minutes.  You know when it is done when it sounds hollow when you thump the top.Actually, I have just been adding the three cups of flour in the beginning and lightly dust the board when I knead the bread.  You can do it according to directions but you end up using all the flour anyway so -- yeah, I just put it all in.   Ok, note about pan.  I used this ceramic pan three times and two out of the three times it didn't turn out like I wanted it.  You aren't supposed to have to grease the pan after the first use but the last time I used it I buttered the pan and the bread was soggy and today, I didn't grease the pan and the bread stuck.  So, I have had great luck with this recipe with a regular loaf pan that you can buy at the grocery store or Target.  I won't be using this pan again.  Anyway, this is my white bread recipe.  It is fast and easy to mix up, you don't feel like you are doing heavy exercise to mix it up and it turns out really good.  So, enjoy!\"Another question raised by YA author A.S. King‘s blog post last week which touched on censorship—especially as it pertains to young adult books. She writes:If there really is [an ideal] town like this in America, I am happy about that. Really truly happy. But are your teenagers going to stay in that town forever? Don’t you want them to go to college? Or go out in the world and do stuff? And don’t you want them to be prepared for all of these real things that happen all the time in real life? Don’t you want them to know that they will make mistakes? Don’t you want them to learn how to make smarter mistakes? Fiction can help. I write my books for one reason, whether they are for adults or teens. I write to make readers think. I write to widen perspective. I write to make readers ask questions and then answer the questions or start conversations. And I write sometimes to give voice to the throwaways, of which our society has many, but we usually hide them because we are still uncomfortable with what we see as our own mistakes. Make sure you say that in a whisper. Throwaways.And so … this, right here, pretty much explains exactly WHY I like reading so much. Yes, it’s fun and entertaining and diverting, and all that, but ultimately, it TEACHES me things. It broadens my horizons and makes me look at ideas and people and life in general in new and interesting ways. Isn’t that what reading and art in general is SUPPOSED to do? How do you feel about this? Do you agree? Disagree? Discuss!\"I believe that reading is a venue for learning as well as a pleasurable activity for relaxation and diversion.  As my neighbor told my bride-to-be daughter \"if you can read, you can cook\".  I was an avid reader as a child -- it was my activity of choice since I wasn't particularly athletic and I was an only child so I spent lots of time on my own.  I loved the books by Kate Seredy -- \"The Good Master\" and \"The Singing Tree\"  which took me into a culture and an era that was not my own.  I was entranced. I always enjoyed historical fiction because I was curious about how the generations before me lived.I am still the same way as an adult -- I love reading for pleasure but I also read for knowledge.  I read lots of magazines -- Smithsonian being one of my favorites-- and I am an avid blog reader.  I quilt, cross stitch and embroider and I enjoy reading about what other crafters are doing and learning new techniques.I do genealogy so I am fascinated with reading old documents and records as well as tips on how to find more information.  When I began doing family history, the first official document to find it's way into my hands was my great-grandmother's death certificate.  I was in awe that I had a piece of paper in my hand that would help me to know the woman who mothered my grandfather -- the woman I never knew but was always curious about.  Reading that document gave me insight about the woman but also about her life.  Nothing can compare to that and yes, it was a learning opportunity.I love reading books/magazines/blogs that take me places that I will never go but would love to.  Pictures make me happy! I also learn a lot about the children of today by studying current kid-lit fare.  Can't say I am thrilled with that in some cases but it is a window into the child world today.So, yes, I would say that reading is as much a learning opportunity as it is a pleasurable activity.I am opposed to censorship because it is subjective.  Who is doing the censoring?  Who has the right to determine what I read or don't read?  When my children were young I was aware of what they read but I never censored what they read.  I was much more concerned about tv programs and movies.  I find it very disturbing to think that somebody could control what I read/watch/think/say.  The only person that has the right to do that is me."},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, March 10, 2014", "text": "Necessity -- The Mother of All Invention -- and Then There Was Pinterest and the Genius HusbandAs I stated in my last post, I was going to have the honor and privilege of having my youngest granddaughter spend the night with us on Saturday night.  I was thrilled as this was a new experience for me.  There was a bit of apprehension, however, as it has been a very long time since I have had a \"little\" in my house  and I knew I was sorely prepared as I don't have a particularly \"child friendly\" house (read travertine floors) and an elaborate day bed with designs in which I could just envision a little head or hands or feet being caught.So, as I set about making preparations for the visit I knew that I had to somehow come up with an idea for a guard rail for the bed.  Now Bean has been in a toddler bed for a long time and there is a low guard rail on that so she is used to some sort of confinement but I didn't really like the guard rails I could find to purchase because they are much higher than she is used to and I didn't know if they would work with the type of bed I have with a mattress on a metal spring rather than a box spring.  So, I was on a quest.I found inflatable guards.  These were $25 a piece.I found a cute little inflatable toddler bed but, for $79 I decided this wasn't a good option since she is growing and would probably grow out of it before it would wear out since I don't imagine sleeping over is going to become a common practice.  Also, I didn't like the idea that it was only 4 inches off the floor -- dusty carpet and this kid just don't mix -- let the wheezing begin!So, off to Pinterest I go and look at all manner of ways to keep a child in the bed.  One entry mentioned pool noodles.Before I had a chance to mention it to my husband he asked if we still had the pool noodles I had bought a couple of years ago to make blocks out of and of course the answer was yes as I never seem to throw anything away.  So, in five minutes the pool noodles became a guard rail and it worked beautifully!  I was thrilled that I finally got to use those stupid incredibly useful things instead of throwing them away.  Plus, it is so easy and cheap (I got them at the dollar store for, yes, $1 each and they are made in the USA).  It is easy to assemble providing you have four rubber bands and a towel and it was perfect.  It fit under the deep pocket fitted sheet and was high enough to corral the kiddo yet low enough for her to climb in and out of bed.  When we were done we simply removed the noodles and stored them in the closet and folded up the towel.three pool noodles held together with regular rubber bandsstacked like a pyramidwrapped in a thick towel to make it cushyGenius!  So, in order to eliminate the problem (fear) of having little body parts get caught up in the swirly ironwork, we simply threw the comforter over the back of the bed and tucked it in between the mattress and the headboard and then tucked it in behind the top of the headboard -- it looked upholstered and voila! no way to get stuck!It made a cozy little nest for the Bean and she slept quite well.  I would say the first sleepover was a rousing success!"},

Had a doctor's appointment on Wednesday but he was called into surgery and I had to reschedule -- after I was already sitting in his waiting room!  So, that threw the day off.  It has just been a week of near-misses and re-do's.  Good thing I am flexible and don't get angry over stuff like that.However, the weekend proves to be exciting.  We will be having a house guest and I am very excited.  This is our Bean's first foray into sleeping over.  She has been at our house sans parental units before but not for overnight.  This will be a first and I am looking forward to it.  I will let you know how it goes but now I have to go turn my sewing space back into a guest room.  I am working on a quilt that I am really wanting to get finished soon but I keep having to put it away for one reason or another.  However, I am hoping to get that finished next week as I won't be babysitting due to spring break. So, for now, wish me luck!

Anyway, I went outside and took a good look at the wretched garden.  Hopefully this latest cold snap will be the last and we will be able to do something about the garden.  However, even with everything pretty much dead, the mint wouldn't give up the ghost -- unfortunately.The mint patch -- quite dead?Not quite -- here is the new growthI then walked around to the side of the house to find our crab apple tree sprouting all these lovely little leaves.  Such a shame because I know we will have one more freezeI then came into the house and announced to the Hubs that I wanted to take a stroll.  That really blew him away.  We live in a very small housing development with only about 75 houses -- if that many -- I will have to count them.  There is a central gate that divides the neighborhood and we live at one end.  If you walk from our drive to the other end of the neighborhood and back it is approximately 1/2 mile.  I chose to walk to the gate because between the perusing of the back garden and the declaration that I would be taking a walk, the temperature dropped about 10 degrees and the wind picked up.  So, we made it to the gate and back again and that squelched my desire for a walk.  My husband is still scratching his head, however, over my desire to actually leave the confines of my house to commune with nature.We then left the house to do a couple of errands.  We went to the bank and then to Half Price Books. Half Price Books is my first line of defense when it comes to book buying.  I know I should be using the library but it is farther away and that requires me remembering that I need to return books.  My memory seems to be in a bit of a fragile state right now so I try not to stress it out more than necessary.  At any rate, I went in with a list and got most of what I went after but not all.  Here is my haul.I also wanted a copy of \"The Screwtape Letters\" but they didn't have one so I will buy it for my Nook.  They did have a copy of \"Mrs. Lincoln's Dressmaker\" but it was only $5 less than retail and I think I would like it in paperback.So, that has been my day, thus far.  Now, I am going to have lunch and read until it is time to pick up the Bean from school.  I wonder if, by then, I am going to need a coat?Musing Mondays is hosted by Miz B at Should Be Reading.  This morning's \"musing\" is a bit involved but here goes.3 Books That Have Impacted YouThe Good MasterThe Kitchen HouseA Woman of Substance3 Books Currently on Your WishlistMrs. Lincoln's Dressmaker The Screwtape LettersThe Great Gatsby (no, I didn't read it in high school much to everyone's shock)3 Books You Have Purchased in the Last Six MonthsFrench Women Don't Get FaceliftsThe Christmas CandleNancy Drew, The Bungalow Mystery3 Books You Can't Help But Recommend to OthersFolly BeachA Woman of SubstanceThe Aunt Dimity Series3 Books With Amazing CoversOk, this is my weakness because I tend to buy books by their covers so I don't know if this answer is going to reflect amazing covers or just covers that appeal to me.I love the covers of the Jan Karon's Mitford Series as well as the Aunt Dimity Series.  The Elm Creek series has covers that appeal  to me as well although they are a bit whimiscal, like the other two.  Another author that has beautiful covers is Kate Morton.

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, February 19, 2014", "text": "Learning to Scan -- finallyA number of years ago we had a lovely photo scanner/printer.  Then we changed operating systems and my lovely photo scanner/printer no longer worked.  So, we went out and purchased a scanner/printer that would play nice with Linux and it is very nice but it won't print photos well.  That stands to reason since it isn't a photo printer -- duh, Melissa!Ok, it has taken me all this time to figure out that it might not print out the photos but it most certainly will scan them in and very well, I might add.  I kept asking the Hubs to do something so that I could post old photos to my blog, Ancestry.com, and Facebook.  His answer was for him to photograph the photographs and then download them.  That works but it requires him to actually do it and therein lies the problem.A couple of weeks ago I was whining discussing the issue with him and voila! he sat down and figured out how to use the scanning option of the machine.  Of course, we knew how to scan, we have been scanning documents for ages but not photos.  So, after about an hour he has figured out how to scan and crop and save in Shotwell.The real challenge was teaching me how to do it.  So, armed with a yellow pad to write down the steps I was ready.  However, he really needs to get over his over reaction when I touch the mouse.  It really freaks him out because he says I just push buttons willy nilly when all I have done is put my hand on the mouse.  We aren't particularly compatible when it comes to computers. It is a good thing we met and married before home computers were available otherwise I have no idea what might have happened. Anyway, I digress.So, after a bit of fiddling around I managed to scan in and tag a half dozen photos and think I can actually do it myself but we shall see.  I will try a few more this evening.But, in honor of me mastering scanning (gag!)

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, February 17, 2014", "text": "Recipe UpdateA couple of posts ago I discussed some recipes I was trying so I thought I would update.Brownies -- the recipe I tried with three different chocolates was just too chewy -- in fact, it didn't taste done even though I cooked it longer than it called for.  So, I finally tried the one bowl recipe on the inside of the Baker's Unsweetened Chocolate Box and that is exactly what I was looking for.  After taste testing it was about as close to a box mix as I think I will get so it is going to be my go-to brownie recipe.Cornbread -- I haven't made this recipe again but will this week.  I had tweaked the original recipe myself so I am going back to the original recipe only I am going to cut the sugar in half.  I will revisit when I have done that.Squash Salad -- I recently read the book French Women Don't Get Facelifts and was surprised that there were some recipes included.  One caught my eye and I tried it yesterday.  It is a squash salad and it was surprisingly good -- I wasn't sure what to expect.  The ingredients are yellow squash, thinly sliced , zucchini sliced into thin ribbons and cherry tomatoes.  A light dressing of olive oil, sherry vinegar and lemon juice is added along with chopped fresh mint and feta cheese.  I had to change the recipe in a bit because I didn't have the correct ingredients.  I substituted lime juice for the lemon juice because I was out of lemon juice.  I also substituted white wine vinegar for the sherry vinegar and I had to chop up a tomato as I forgot to buy cherry tomatoes.  I don't think the tomatoes made a big difference but I am not sure about the lime juice and the different vinegar.  With all that changing, though, it was really good.  I had never thought about a squash salad but it will become part of my regular rotation.For anybody who thinks I have taken all leave of my senses in my old age let me explain.  I am trying to get all the toxins and negative things out of my diet and my house so I have resorted to scratch cooking which is actually proving to be more fun that I thought it would be.  I am not a stranger to the concept but we have gotten to the point that we are either eating out or take-out or convenience foods and I am trying to change that.  I used to spend my time quilting or cross stitching or internet surfing -- now I find I am spending my time cooking.  I have been dabbling in the creation of a greener life and also becoming more minimalist in our lifestyle and I like the idea of buying raw ingredients and putting them together to actually make something rather than just opening a box or a can and worrying about the ingredients that I can't pronounce or what is lining the can.  After a weekend pantry overhaul, I am standing back looking at my lovely, retro glass jars full of flours, sugars and cornmeal -- my turntables with my baking supplies organized where I can actually find something and all my bottles there in one place -- and it is peaceful.  It is somehow relaxing and reassuring to know that I can actually create what I want from these simple ingredients and don't have to rely on a box of something that I might or might not have.  I know that sounds really crazy but it takes me back to what I consider a better time -- my youth -- when everybody lived this way.  It makes me happy.So, now that I have found the perfect brownie recipe and the perfect cornbread recipe I am off to find the perfect biscuit recipe.  I grew up eating biscuits made from Pioneer Biscuit Mix -- local to San Antonio -- and it makes lovely biscuits.  My goal is to find a recipe to make equally as good biscuits as those from scratch.  I will review when I do.Musing Mondays -- February 17, 2014Musing Mondays is hosted by MizB at Should Be Reading.  To participate you need to answer one of several questions.  Today I will be discussing what I am reading currently and my opinion of the book.I am currently reading The Quilter's Legacy by Jennifer Chiaverini.  It is the fifth book in the Elm Creek Creek series.  While you wouldn't have to read these books in order, it is helpful because there is a serial aspect to them.I have only just begun this book but I am totally into it.  Even though I am more than twenty years younger than the main character -- Sylvia Bergstrom -- I identify with her.  I don't think I am necessarily like her because, in the first book, she is quite gruff but I think I admire her.  In any event, for an octogenarian, she has serious spunk.I especially love the setting of these books.  Elm Creek Manor is a place I could see myself visiting and probably never wanting to leave.  The thought of having inherited a mansion and then turning it into something like a quilt camp just sounds like a lot of fun. Then, there is the quilting.  When I began this series of books, I thought they would be heavy with all things quilting but they aren't.  There is just enough to get me over my \"quilting block\" and inspire me to get back into it.  I am the sort of person that has to be in the mood to do something and sometimes I need a little push.The history aspect of these books is very appealing.  If you like history or do genealogy these books will appeal to you.  There is a little of all of it. These books also have a bit of mystery to them so if you like mysteries, there is some of that for you, as well.All in all, I have enjoyed this series thus far and I am sure my current read will be no different."},

I seem to have an abundance of outdated food and many duplicates of things that I don't need.  I know why.  It is a large pantry and very disorganized so when I can't find something I need I just go out and buy more and then shove it in the over stuffed pantry on top of the stuff I already have.  If they had a show for Pantry Hoarders I would be a great candidate for it.Hubs and I have been looking at ways to reorganize and so we made several purchases.  Since I am trying to cook more from scratch and less from processed, boxed foods, I am looking for storage for more raw ingredients.  I had several of these jars in the past, gave them away and realized lately that they were really good so I have purchased more.We have a reasonably large pantry with L-shaped shelves.  That is all fine and good except for those pesky corners which are very difficult to deal with because things get lost in them.  When you are shorter, like I seem to be getting, the third shelf up is just too high for me to get into the corner so we bought  three of these for two of the corners.We bought two large ones -- one for bottles and one for baking supplies.  I seem to constantly lose that little tin of baking powder.  You can't imagine how much I was able to put on these whirly gigs and clear off much shelf space.  The smaller one we use for meds.  We don't have medicine cabinets in the bathrooms so we keep those things in the kitchen but want them up out of the way of curious children.  So, they have worked well so far.    I have been paying close attention to our food and what is in it so I am making more of an attempt to cook from scratch.  My husband doesn't like my cooking -- much prefers restaurant fare -- so I thought he would really like home cooked meals from scratch.  Wrong! Again -- he prefers restaurant food.  I, on the other hand, am tiring of it.  As I find myself harkening back to a different time (makes my childhood sound eons past) I realize that I really like my cooking, such as it is.  I like easy, simple meals -- mostly cooked in an oven because the stove top and I don't seem to play nice together. ( A couple of months ago I actually started my first ever grease fire but that is another story.)  However, I don't like all the junk that is in most of our foods -- from the unrecognizable ingredients in boxed goods to the linings of the cans.  I mean, seriously, why do they have to screw up the green beans -- those cute little diagonally cut morsels we all put in green bean casseroles?  So, in an effort to find scratch recipes that will successfully replace the boxed varieties and get rid of the poisonous cans, I have been doing lots of research and lots of playing in the kitchen.  Fortunately, Hubs has been a willing taste tester although he doesn't like much of what I am doing but at least he is honest.My first attempt was to make a hot cocoa mix that would rival Swiss Miss.  I found a recipe online that was DIVINE! It consisted of powdered milk, unsweetened cocoa, powdered sugar and white chocolate chips.  Basically you grind it all up together in the food processor and mix 1/3 of a cup of the mix to a mug of hot milk.  It was perfect and entirely too sweet.  I am making an effort to cut sugar out of my diet but I am realistic and know that is going to be difficult so I am going about it slowly.  If I am going to eat something sweet I want it to be worth it. Today I tried to make it one cup at a time, without the powdered sugar.  It was really good but it didn't mix up well so I am going to concoct my own recipe and try again.Then, I tried to find a recipe for brownies that were as good as a boxed mix.  I googled \"chewy brownie recipe\" and picked from the numerous sites that came up.  They were chewy all right -- as in not done even though I cooked them longer than the recipe called for.  I will be revisiting that with a recipe I found from Rachel Ray's site.  It calls for three types of chocolate so we will see.  I will probably have to rely on somebody else's opinion of these because I am pretty sure there will be too much sugar for me.Then, there was the cornbread.  I like my cornbread to be a bit cakey rather than crumbly and I found a recipe that I thought would work to replace my favorite Pioneer Corn Muffin mix.  I had read a couple of other recipes that called for brown sugar in them and so I thought I would divide the sugar using white sugar for half and brown for the other half.  The recipes said \"it made the cornbread\".  Well, not for me.  The bread rose up beautifully and had a lovely texture.  It was a little darker due to the brown sugar but it tasted really -- well -- brown sugary.  Too much molasses.  So, I will try it again without the brown sugar and I will probably swap the milk with buttermilk and cut the sugar in half.Fortunately my regular white bread recipe has turned out to be a winner.  I did substitute butter for the shortening but that was the only change I made and it is the only bread we have had in the house for weeks.  It makes a lovely full loaf and it lasts for several days unlike the bread made in the bread machine.  I also used one of these pans for the last loaf I made and I loved the results although most breadmakers will tell you to just use a regular aluminum loaf pan.  I have been using that sort of pan and it turns out great but I ran across this pottery pan in the back of a bottom cabinet -- I forgot I had bought it -- and it was really good.So, I can't believe I am having all these culinary adventures in my old age but I am .  My three year old granddaughter wants to be a \"cooker\" and loves to get in the kitchen so I am having thoughts of trying to influence her to cook from scratch, something I could never achieve with her mother.  She already has a good sense of \"good food\" versus \"bad food\" so maybe with a little encouragement from me her interest in cooking will grow.  Of course, for that to happen, I have to work at it myself so maybe I will have some recipes to pass on to her when she gets that restaurant of her own she says she wants.  Or, maybe she will just be able to feed herself which is a good goal as well.I Am Not Sure When it Happened .....but, I have changed.I am a child of the 50's -- you know, that perfect decade where all women vacuumed in high heels and pearls and children could run free without fear.I am a teenager of the 60's -- you know, the perfect generation even with all the social discord and inequities and drugs but wonderful clothes and music which drove most of our parents to distraction and practically the poor house.I was never a \"flower child\".  I was too busy being cute in preppy clothes and since I didn't seem to be able to grow long, gloriously straight hair it seemed pointless to try.  I did try being \"mod\" and would layer white eyeliner over blue eyeliner (thanks Maybelline!) and I tried my hand at asymmetrical hair cuts.The 70's found me in the professional world which I didn't do very well, fashion wise, a wedding dress which I did quite well and for the rest of the decade I was in maternity or mommy clothes.Everything after that was a blur.  I seemed to have completely lost my identity.  I can't remember what I did, other than Mommy things, or what I wore. Now here I am -- 63 years old and suddenly discovering a \"new\" me.  I am a late bloomer -- now I am becoming a flower child -- environmentally that is -- not particularly politically -- I am too religious to think politically -- they don't seem to go together very well.  I digress.  I don't know what to do with this new found me.I don't even know when it happened.  I could feel it coming on a few years ago when the news about plastics leaked (sorry for the pun) out. Then I started reading about the toxins in our everyday world -- things I had been exposed to all my life.  Then I thought about my children -- how much had I exposed them to toxic things never realizing.  The guilt was a little overwhelming.  I watched my parents pass away due to self inflicted diseases -- they were life-long smokers -- how could they do that, how could their addictions be more important than me -- how did their smoking affect me long term.  I started changing everything in our lives -- my husband's head was spinning. Then I got the diagnosis -- you know, the one everybody dreads.  You know, the one that seems to be more and more common and suddenly my interest in our environment -- generally and personally -- was tantamount. Nobody knows what happened with me.  I was asked if I smoked or lived in a smoking home -- well, yes, for twenty two years.  I got \"the look\", the nod and info duly noted.So, since that little life altering event I have done a lot of major changes.  I have taken to buying more and more organic food.  I have just about completely cut sugar out of my diet and am eating more fruits and vegetables -- almost to the point of being vegetarian.  I have tossed all my cosmetics and skin care and have replaced these items with organic items -- most of which I can eat.Good as skin moisturizer and to pop popcorngood for facial masques and for burnsGood in granola and on your face  Ok -- don't eat this My household cleaning items consists of soap/water, baking soda and vinegar.  I make my own laundry soap and am planning to making my own dishwashing soap next week.   I am completely aware of everything I put on my body as well as in my body.  My husband isn't sure of all of this -- especially since I refuse to use his favorite Dawn dishwashing detergent  but I do allow it in the kitchen.I have been doing all I can to increase my exercise without actually exercising, although some of that is going to start happening as well.  I bought a pedometer and now count my steps throughout my day.If, late in the day, I don't feel as if I have walked enough, I have a \"track\" through my open concept house that I walk-- it is 100 steps around it so I just do several of those.  I was so stiff this morning that I did a few laps just to walk through the pain and loosen up -- it worked.These are all things that have changed about me.  I have become more thoughtful about what I do and how I spend my time.  I have become acutely aware of what we, as humans, do to our environment and to ourselves and it is totally frightening.  I have, as a result, gone back to doing things like we used to do them when I was a child.  I wash more dishes by hand (little bit of exercise there), I bake our bread by a recipe that I mix with a spoon, not a bread machine--great upper body exercise.  I have regressed.  I have walked away from our modern, advanced life in many ways.  I watch less tv and read more books.  I have cut down on computer time and sleep more. And, what have I got for all of this?  Am I healthier? I would like to think so.  Am I more socially aware?  Oh yes.  Am I richer?  Monetarily -- in a way because doing things the way I am doing them is cheaper.  I am not buying expensive cosmetics and skin care or cleaning items. The things, however, that I have gotten from all of this is doing things the \"old\" way keeps us moving.  Using non toxic products and a little elbow grease won't hurt us.  If using less toxic cosmetics mean we use less and look more like ourselves-- so be it.   I have learned that less is truly more.  By feeling like I am doing something positive for myself, my family and those around me I feel calm.  I am not obsessing over things anymore.  I am not anxiety ridden anymore.  I am not frightened anymore and I am able to \"live and let live\".  I don't worry one whit about what people think about me or what I do or how I think.  I am focused on \"paying it forward\".  I haven't figured out how to do that on a large scale and maybe that is because it isn't supposed to be done on a large scale -- maybe it is the little things that count.  I don't know but that is my goal -- to pay it forward.  It is my purpose in life now, aside from my family, to do what little good I can for others and trying to reduce my carbon footprint is one of those ways.Yes, I think I have become a flower child.  I wonder if I should try, once again, to grow long, glorious hair?"},

Like Guiliano's other book French Women Don't Get Fat, the author has provided insight as to how French women stay vibrant and youthful throughout their lives.  Actually, the advice given in the book seems pretty universal, eat less, more veg and fruit, moderate exercise -- all good advice but the one difference is the author promotes more \"natural\" ageing and less intervention involving surgeries, drugs, injections, cosmetics, chemicals etc.  She discuses everything from style to supplements to food, even including some recipes -- one of which I intend to try this week.It was a good book in that it gives women of \"a certain age\" license to be what we are and to be comfortable in our skin.  I enjoyed reading it."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, February 03, 2014", "text": "The Humble HankyThe weather in North Texas has been inexplicable this winter.  It has always been variable but it has gone from the ridiculous to the sublime this winter.  It was 70 on Saturday and freezing with ice and snow on Sunday.  I have been sick for over a week.  I thought it was seasonal allergies but I think I was wrong.  I believe I have either had an old fashioned cold or a sinus infection but whatever it is I feel bad enough to not want to leave the house but good enough to be bored out of my mind.  So, what is a sneezy, honking, coughing girl to do?  Well, I decided to sew.  And what did I decide to sew?  Hankies. The decision was fueled by a very raw, painful nose and by the plan to use up some fabric scraps that were big enough to do something with but not so big to constitute yardage.  Plus, I had a block of time that I could actually sit down and get involved in something but I didn't feel good enough to have to actually get involved in anything I had to THINK about.  So, being the person I am and always researching ways to be thrifty and green, I had been looking at making handkerchiefs and flannel cosmetic squares.  So, I fished around my fabric stash and found a bunch of flannel left over from making baby blankets, I cut it up, hemmed it down and this was my final product. 9 flannel hankies I then decided to take the scraps from making the hankies and make some cosmetic squares.  I don't wear a lot of makeup and all of it washes off with soap and water.  I also don't wear nail polish so I don't have to worry about removing that so these should work really nicely for applying the rosewater I use after I wash my face.  cosmetic squaresI simply cut the leftover flannel into 2 inch squares, stacked two together and zigzagged around the edges. They are nice and soft and just the right size.I was planning on using a lingerie bag to store the soiled items waiting for the laundry but I have decided to use a small, plastic trash can in the laundry room and just place the items in there.  It will be small so I can wash it out and spray it down from time to time.  Unless I am sick, which rarely happens, I don't use many tissues so I think this new hanky plan will work for me. I have been using them for a day now and I have to say I have kept up with the one I have in my hand/pocket quite well and am not having to go around and pick up stray tissues all over the floor.I do have a lovely collection of vintage handkerchiefs that I pulled out before making these but somehow they just didn't look so comfy and besides, they are pretty and I didn't want to use them for actually blowing my nose.  Plus, I think my flannel ones are really absorbent and they feel really good.So, that is what a half sick, bored person does on a ice and snow day in North Texas.  You might be asking yourself what will she do today?  Well, I am going to finish a set of placemats I started about four years ago and make some matching napkins for them.  I will post photos.BTW -- in case you are wondering, yes, I did visit my little Dr. man and I did take an antibiotic and I now think the whole thing is breaking up and leaving me so hopefully I will be back to my old self completely in the next couple of days."},

So, I will probably be off to see the little dr. man tomorrow but, in the meantime, I am probably going to have to miss my grandson's 7th birthday party.  However, I would rather miss it than be in a roomful of kids and pick up who knows what from them.  I am not sure what shape my immune system is in after chemo treatments so I am trying to be sensible.   I have felt so good and had so much energy that I don't want to put myself in harms way.  There was a time when I wouldn't think of myself first but that only got me into trouble so now I have to put myself first.

Six cups of regular rolled oats2 tsp, cinnamon and vanilla, 1 tsp salt, diced walnuts to taste2/3 cups local honey, 1/4 cups neutral oil1 cup currants -- more or less to taste or you can use raisinsAll mixed up and spread on cookie sheet to cookOk, you mix everything together except the currants (or raisins), spread in a thin layer on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 for.....well, that is a tricky question.  I have tried timing it but it messes up on a regular basis so my advice would be to WATCH it.  It burns easily because of the honey so just watch it until you get it browned to your satisfaction.After it cools add the currants or raisins and stir.  Sometimes, when I can find it, I add a cup or two of shredded, unsweetened coconut before I bake it.  It adds a little texture but, being unsweetened, it doesn't make it overly sweet.I store it in a glass jar and there you have it. Busy work, busy work ----The weather here in North Texas has been very Texas-like lately.  We have had several days of really gorgeous, springlike weather but as is usual in Texas, it changes quickly and so do our activities.  We have been getting out and about a lot during the good days which has been great but we have also been staying in a lot which requires having something to do so you just don't succumb to cabin fever.  I have been doing a lot of these.They are very addicting and satisfies my need to do handwork and I can watch tv and not have to concentrate on it too much.  I am not sure what i am going to do with them when I am done but I will figure it out.  Since I am interested in making placemats and napkins lately, I might use some of them for that.  This is just a small sampling of what I have to work with -- trust me -- there are MANY!I have also been doing some reading for my 2014 Goodreads Challenge.  Right now I am reading \"French Women Don't Get Facelifts\" by Mireille Guiliano.  I have just started it but it seems to embrace the same ideals of aging that I possess myself.  Trying to do it gracefully but perhaps this book will give me some pointers.I am also reading \"The Big House\"  by George Howe Colt.  It is the story of the summer house owned by his family and a vanishing way of life.  I just started it but it is very good, so far, and takes me to a part of the country -- New England -- that I have never been to but always wanted to go to and gives a glimpse into the lives of people who spend their summers in houses in places they don't live -- an event less common today, I would suspect.I have also been baking lots of bread.  I don't care for commercially made bread.  I don't know why, it is what I was raised on, but it just doesn't taste good to me anymore.  So, I have been baking bread and doing it the old fashioned way -- not in a bread machine -- because I prefer the form.  The bread machine bread doesn't make nice sandwiches and it also dries out much quicker.  Venturing farther into the cooking realm, I have also been making my own granola.  Not rocket science, I know, but it is really good and the more I eat of this homemade food, the less I like the commercial, processed varieties.  I haven't calculated cost because that isn't really my emphasis in  making things myself, but I would imagine that it makes the products more expensive but at least we aren't throwing half the food away which is another calculated expense.  So, I have now taken to making my own breakfast cereal, my own bread, my own cookies and I discovered a lovely little cake in my very first Betty Crocker cookbook which was given to me as a wedding present.  It is called \"Dinette Cake\" and is made in a 9 inch cake pan.  It comes up in a nice layer and frosted it makes a great little dessert for us with only six portions (or eight if you cut it that way) which means a lot less for us to eat since neither one of us need it at all.So, that is what I have been doing.  Sounds boring but it has been a lot of fun and I have been having a great time exploring new ways of doing things."},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, January 19, 2014", "text": "2014 Goodreads ChallengeI finished the second book for my 2014 Goodreads Challenge -- The Christmas Candle by Max Lucado. I had seen the book in B&N many times and saw the ads for the movie but never picked the book up nor did I see the movie at Christmas.  I wanted to but time just never allowed.I was reading a post at Brandon's Notepad and his review of the book and the movie made me want to read it right away.  So, while still reading the post, I  downloaded the book and started reading immediately.  It is a short read but it is very good, very satisfying.  Although it is a bit predictable, that didn't take away from its charm or its message.  It takes place in a small English village with a cast of colorful characters welcoming a new minister following the death of the rector that had always been there.  The young man is pleasant enough and catches the eye of the local young women but he has a hard and bitter heart .  The townsfolk are perplexed that he refused to believe in the legend of the candle -- a time honored belief of the people that really brings hope to them.  However, as the Christmas season progresses, the young rector has a change of heart and, at the end ..... well, maybe you should read it for yourself.There are things about the book that are a bit vague such as what denomination does the young minister belong to.  I believe him to be Church of England.  The reason I say this is the term \"rector\".  In Methodist churches the ministers are called Brother (at least ours was when I was growing up) and in Lutheran Churches they are called Pastor.  Also, because this is set in England I think it is a safe assumption to make.  There is not a lot said about the village itself but you can picture a small, English village with a bridge going across a small creek or river at the edge of town.  You know it is small because of the population and their interaction with each other.  There is enough said, however, so that you can form a mental picture.  The author adequately makes you feel the cold of the winter and the warmth of the indoors as well as the light of the candle and the presence of the angel.And then there is the sub-story of Abigail. This is a good little read -- a lot packed into a small book.  I don't generally re-read books but I think I will re-read this one around Christmas next year and I can't wait for the movie to come out next month. I recommend."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, January 13, 2014", "text": "Old School or Just Old I am finally beginning to feel old.  Not old in that decrepit, old crone way -- just old enough to start comparing life today with the life of my youth.  It has come to my attention lately that, without much thought given to it, I have reverted back to doing things the way I used to when I was a young bride (no, we didn't have a pet dinosaur) or even back to the way my mother did things.I noticed this the other day when I told my husband that if he wants to do any changing of things in the kitchen, he could do away with the microwave and have a double oven put in.  I find the microwave to be the most useless appliance around.  However, I could use two ovens.  I had two ovens in my old house and loved them but I barely had room for a microwave. I no longer have an electric can opener, haven't for years, nor do I have an electric skillet.  I cook on the stove and in the oven -- I have even taken to making toast in the oven like my mother used to -- you can make much more at a time.  When the pop-up kicks it, I am not sure I will replace it.I don't care for commercial bread.  I just don't like the taste of it and Hubs rarely eats it when I buy it so we toss copious amounts of the stuff in the trash.  I don't even feed it to the birds because I am afraid they would just keel over from ingesting it.  So, I make bread, in a bread machine.  A noisy, big, clunky bread machine that is hard to store.  So, I was reading some blogs the other day and realized that making the bread like I used to when my children were little (I was a real Earth Mother back then) was just as easy and not nearly so noisy.  So, I sat about doing just that and it was wonderful.  The bread lasted longer than the bread machine bread and it looked normal.  So, this morning I quickly mixed up another batch and am enjoying the smell of the rising bread as I type this. I also have a real dislike of emptying the dishwasher.  So, I have taken to washing the dishes by hand.  There are only two of us so how long does it take to wash a couple of bowls in the morning?  It seems like I get jobs finished completely when doing things \"old school\" rather than with all the labor saving appliances we have now. I sweep the floors with a broom and use an old fashioned dust mop that I bought online -- I only vacuum occasionally.  I dust with a lambswool duster -- I don't use swiffers or anything of that manner.  My husband prefers to dust with the vacuum cleaner but I find that to be exhausting -- too much arm work.I have discussed here in the past that I tend to line dry more of my clothes than I tumble dry.  I just prefer not to be a slave to the dryer. I have tried all sorts of exercise equipment over the years to get myself in better shape but they have all been an epic fail.  Our latest acquisition of about seven years ago is a Tony Little Gazelle.  The concept is great -- low impact on knees that are aging quicker than the rest of me.  Uh, not so much.  It completely wrecks my knees and back so I decided that walking, on my feet, on the ground is the best exercise with a few pilates thrown in.  Pilates is fantastic -- did it in college in a dance class I took and it completely changed my body.  I finished the semester, quit doing the pilates and the old body snapped back just like a rubber band.  Note to self - don't quit doing the pilates.  Anyway, I digress.  So, I decided that a fitbit would be a great thing to have -- linked right up to the computer to download your activity through the day.  Again -- not so much.  It wouldn't sync to my computer since we don't use windows and back to the store it went. What I ended up with is thisand thisoh, and a pencil but I didn't think I needed to show you that.  So, I am counting my steps with the pedometer and writing down the information daily.  It is working just fine.  I am keeping track of my water intake, my steps, my calories expended, etc and it doesn't involve a computer.  I was surprised that yesterday I walked almost 9000 steps, about 2.63 miles -- just in my house doing my daily chores.  So....So, anyway, am I just getting old or could it be possible that doing things \"old school\" is really easier?  I am thinking it is.   Musing Mondays -- January 13, 2014   Question: Are “best” and “favorite” the same thing? If someone asked you “What’s the best book you ever read?” would the answer be the same as for “What’s your favorite?” {source}I would assume that by \"best\" you mean the best written technically and \"favorite\" is the one you like the most regardless of the quality of writing.  I think these terms are probably more interchangeable in younger readers than adults.  A child can read a book (do they even still do that?) and declare it to be the best book ever but an adult will be more discerning. How would I answer that question?  I have no idea.  I don't know that I can answer because I don't know that  I have a favorite book although I have many that stand out in my mind.  As far as \"best\", unless the writing is just completely horrendous (like you can't understand what is being said because of lousy syntax) I tend to not be particularly critical if I am \"into\" the story.  However, if the writing is really awful, there is no way I can get into the story if I have to work too hard at figuring out what is trying to be said."},

So, I have to say that I picked a very painful book to read.  It is an account of a man, Don Piper, being involved in an horrific auto accident, his death and trip to Heaven and his return to tell the tale.  I have to say that I was a bit disappointed because the time spent on his account of Heaven.  There wasn't much there but I don't really know what I expected -- I just expected more.The account of the accident was graphic and painful.  The account of his recovering was long and grueling and he was honest about his depression.  Toward the end he did discuss how the accident had affected his faith and how he realized that he was allowed to live so that he could use his experience as a ministry.  However, the whole book has a depressed tone to it.Would I recommend the book?  I don't know.  I read it, I didn't find it boring but I didn't find it uplifting either.  It was simply painful, beginning to end.   To Fitbit or Not to FitbitA huge part of a successful marriage is patience.  My husband had to test his patience first thing this morning.  Now, I go to bed early and get up early -- generally earlier than him -- so I have lots of time for my brain to work before I see him.  I can formulate honey-do lists, grocery lists, places to go lists -- in multiples -- before his feet ever hit the floor.  I am raring to go and he only has one eye open. Today was the ultimate test.I handed him a math word problem.  I completely expected him to break into the Tammy Wynette song \"D-I-V-O-R-C-E\". However, being the gentleman that he is he simply begged ignorance -- like he didn't quite get what I was asking. Well, what I was asking was -- how long (in time) do I have to walk a predetermined path to total 10,000 steps.  I got THE look -- the blank look so I sat about doing the math myself.  My path is 100 steps.  Clearly I would have to walk it 100 times.  I timed myself with my trusty Timex and it takes a second or two over 1 minute to walk it so......drumroll....I would have to walk it  1 hour and 40 minutes.  Yes, I know that is simple arithmetic but in all fairness to me, I adjusted the path.  My original path was a bit longer and wasn't as easy to calculate so here I am.So, here is the next consideration.  In the last six months I have had major surgery and I have arthritis but I need to exercise.  My exercise of choice is walking.  No, I don't have room for a treadmill and while walking outside would be preferable it is too cold or too many allergens or too hot -- most of the time. We have a Tony Little Gazelle but it just kills my back.  After I got the go ahead from my doctor to exercise I climbed on it, walked for 30 minutes and felt great.  Repeated the next day I sent my back into all sort of discomfort -- not to mention my hip which hurt all the way through me.  So, I rested.  I did the same thing, half the time, night before last and the back was zinging me again so I have now given up on the Gazelle. I don't have any problem walking through my house, however, and the way the floor plan is laid out  I have almost a track like path to walk so that will be my exercise of choice.Now, after all the math is done and the decision to wear out my floors has been made, I have to decide whether to do it the frugal way by just timing or do I buy some sort of a tracker to wear to track my steps for me.  I have been looking at thesebut other than the pink color catching my eye and noting the price differences, I have no clue which one would be the best.  I think I can link it to myfitnesspal on my Nook so that would be good if I were wanting to count calories which I don't really want to do particularly but it would be a good feature. My thought process is that by using a tracker of some sort I could track all my steps throughout the day, not just the 100 laps around the house and maybe I wouldn't have to walk all 100.  Of course, I don't expect to make that goal immediately, maybe never, but it is just that -- a goal -- and any activity toward that goal is a plus.So, any thoughts?"},

What Are You Reading? is hosted by Sheila at Book Journey.  What a great start to a new year, a new week, and a new book.This morning I downloaded a copy of \"The Christmas Candle\" by Max Lucado. I had seen the book many times on the shelves at my neighborhood Barnes and Noble but failed to pick up a copy. I had seen the ads for the movie that I still want to see even though we have moved past the Christmas season but apparently we are not movie goers anymore.  So the whole \"Christmas Candle\" experience escaped me until I read a review on a blog I frequently read.The review, which can be found at Brandon's Notepad, discusses the book and the movie.  The author of the blog entry does an in depth analysis of the religious aspects of the both the book and the movie as well as some comparison/contrast of both.I found the review to be well thought out and compelling -- enough to make me stop reading and download the book which I began immediately.  I will refer back to the blog as I read the book to think through the points made by the blog author.As I generally like to read \"the book\" before I see \"the movie\" I am glad I bought the book in plenty of time to get it read before the movie is released in February.  I am sure I will enjoy both and hope that \"The Christmas Candle\" will become one of my yearly Christmas favorites.Even though I just started the book, it has me hook, line and sinker.  As one reviewer, John C. Maxwell, said \"Fans of Charles Dickens and Jan Karon's Mitford series, you're in for a treat!Max Lucado has penned a wholly original Christmas story complete with cbblestone streets, quirky characters and a supernatural visit that you'll never forget.\"  Well, that cinches it for me -- I am in and I am sure I won't be able to put it down.So, if you have read the book or seen the movie or if you like to read religious analysis, visit Brandon's Notepad.  Perhaps his blog will encourage you to read the book again or, as in my case, the first time.  I will review when I have completed the book."},

I started with EPP a while back and abandoned it -- don't know why -- but have picked it up again.  It is something mindless to do while watching tv and it doesn't make a huge mess. I am also going to go back to foundation piecing because I like the accuracy of it.  I have made a few blocks with the paper foundations and find it a lot of fun, once I figure I have things going correctly.However, after browsing through several blogs I realized I needed some new stuff to do either of these techniques. No, I don't really need new stuff but what a great opportunity to go do a little shopping.  I haven't set foot in a quilt store in quite a while so it was good fun.This is what I came home with.1.  Add-a-quarter ruler to make my trims better on my foundation piecing. 2.  Two packages of templates for my English Paper Piecing3.  Sewline glue stick to eliminate basting on the EPP.  I have tried it but not       sure how I like it yet.4.  Refill cartridges for the glue stick.5.  Clover applique pins.  TINY! but oh-so-cute.I guess all this means I need to get myself in gear and start getting busy!"},

They were at my house yesterday afternoon visiting and they were so much fun to watch.  This was the best moment!H (on the left) and C -- New Year's Eve 2014New Year's Eve was spent at home.  We enjoyed a chuck roast I had put in the crock pot almost twenty four hours earlier and I can't tell you how good it tasted.  I had roasted veggies and scalloped potatoes with it.  After dinner we settled down to a bowl game -- Texas A&M vs Duke University.  I only watched with one eye because I had already started on my 2014 Reading Challenge.I am drawing my books from four sources -- The Elm Creek Series, The Aunt Dimity Series, my Nook queue and the Nancy Drew series.  I also have a couple of biographies to enjoy as well.  The first book I am starting with is one from my Nook -- I am just starting with the first in the alphabetical library list.  However, with that said, I am dismissing any that may have sounded like a good idea when I acquired them but no longer hold any interest for me.  I have no plan to spend my time reading books I am not interested in just because I have them.The book is \"90 Minutes in Heaven\" by Don Piper.  It is a short book, less than 200 pages and it is packed with a painful account of how Mr. Piper was in a horrific automobile accident, sustained horrific injuries, died for 90 minutes and came back to tell the tale.  I don't know why I am chosing to read a book with so much pain involved but I can't put it down.  Do I believe that he actually saw heaven?  I don't know yet but his story sounds an awful lot like the one my brother in law has retold when he had a heart attack a year ago.  So, I will continue and review when I am done.I am not good at reading more than one book at a time but I think I am going to jump into the John Lennon biography.I never had a favorite Beatle but I now I think that John Lennon is the most interesting.  Of course, I still believe in the Paul Is Dead Conspiracy so what do I know?I did buy a new book for my personal library.  I have read quite a few Dorothea Benton Frank books and have decided to add them to my own bookshelves.  So, when I visited Half Price Books a couple of days ago I picked up a brand new copy of \"Folly Beach\" for only $5.98.  I listened to this book on audio book for my 2013 challenge but I might just have to read the actual book.So, that is the beginning of my new year.  Relaxing day reading and stitching today, dinner with daughter tonight and getting on with the rest of my life tomorrow.Have a good one!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, December 30, 2013", "text": "Cosmetic UpdateA while back I posted about my quest for less toxic cosmetics and skin care.  I think at the time I mentioned that my skin care routine now consists of two products -- Dr. Bronner's baby soap and rosewater.  I did buy a bottle of Burt's Bees Rosewater Toner with glycerin the other day and started using it instead of the bottle of plain rosewater I was using.  No particular reason -- and it works the same.  I don't think I will ever vary from this routine because it is just so easy and very cheap frugal.I have been using the Rejuva line of mineral makeup for a few months now and I have to say I love it.  Well, not all of it.  I love the foundation and the blush is what I have been looking for all my life! I don't see myself changing either of those any time soon.  I don't care for the eyeliner pencil I bought as it isn't soft and doesn't go on well on my old, creapy eyelids.  The mascara isn't what I thought it would be either.  It goes on well and doesn't clump but it tends to smudge.  I will finish the tube but I don't know that I will re-order.Looking at other sources for cosmetics I ran across a company called 100% Pure Cosmetics.  I ordered a lipstick.  I don't care for it but it came in a lovely little case.I think part of it is that I just don't like lipstick so for now I am using Burt's Bees Replenishing tinted balm.  I don't think Burt's Bees is so pure but for now it is the best I can do for lippies.  I digress.  The lipstick came with three little samples of other 100% Pure products and I absolutely love them.  One is a coffee bean eye cream, one is a coconut body cream and the other is a super fruit anti-aging cream.  I just tried the super fruit cream this evening and so far I like it but I love the other two -- so much that I placed an order for full sized containers of the products.  I might add the super fruit cream after a couple of days of trying the sample.  I am also going to give their eye shadows a closer look.So, that is where I stand on the less toxic cosmetics.  I have had no desire to search for new foundation or blush and the little containers are so cute!  I would recommend for sure!  I will give another review on the 100% Pure skin care products after I have a chance to use them more.New BlogI started a new blog today.  It isn't to replace this one.  This one will remain what it is and won't overlap with the new one.  The new one is faith based and is actually a personal discipline of gratitude journaling.  I am making it public so that maybe others will want to join in with their own gratitude journal.  So, visit me here if you wish:http://tinklepaw.blogspot.com"},

It is the chronicle of a young woman, Ginny Blackstock, who is sent on a journey by her unconventional and newly deceased aunt, Peg.  The journey is guided by 13 little blue envelopes containing instructions along the way.  Each envelope contains a destination and a number of tasks to be completed once Ginny is there -- funds are provided by Aunt Peg.  Clearly this is an opportunity for Ginny to discover herself as she is put in situations that she would probably never find herself in otherwise.The book is reminiscent of \"Bridget Jones Diary\" (which I never read, I am basing my opinion on the movie) and \"Austenland\".  It is light hearted yet very deep.  Ginny finds herself in some situations that she handles with much maturity -- more than most seventeen year olds would.  For that reason, I think it is a bit unrealistic but it is a fun read if you don't get too analytical.I chose it because it is the first on my list in my Nook library.  I keep adding books to my Nook library and then I keep buying physical books so I figured I should start chiseling away at that list.  In fact, that might be one of my own personal challenges for the new year -- read the Nook Books!I am about half way through the book -- it isn't a long book, I have just been busy, and at this point I would recommend it for something light and quick.  I will review further when I am done."},

That tree is decorated with candy canes, jingle bells and glittery pinecones.Since I don't particularly enjoy the decorating part of things, I started slow this year and did just what made me happy to do at the time.  I didn't want it to become a chore.  I started with the ornament collection started for me by JLSHall.  I added one this year in the form of a little owl sitting on a candy cane.  For some reason he just spoke to me. We added the wreathThe NutcrackersAnd, of course, TuppyI wonder where he has gotten off to -- haven't seen him in awhile.  Hmm..that pesky little elf!So, it is all decorated and I actually think I enjoyed it this year.  I decided early on that there was no \"decorate by\" date and I think stretching it out just made it better!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, December 07, 2013", "text": "Minimalism VS Prepper and How I Messed UpWe live in a new house -- built in 2005 -- but we don't live in a huge house.  We \"downsized\" to a garden home  - we have more square footage in our current home than we did in our former home but we have fewer rooms.  We have a \"garden home\" but we have a yard as large as our former yard -- fortunately we don't have to cut it ourselves as that is included in the HOA dues.  When we first moved here we only brought what we absolutely wanted and then took the next six years to empty the former house of our \"stuff\".  It was so nice, at first, to actually have empty drawers and space in the closets but somehow more \"stuff\" has crept into those spaces and now I am trying to sift through it and get rid of things. A good deal of my problem stems from the fact that I sew. I  quilt, I sew and I do needlework -- all hobbies that generate lots of mess.  I don't have a room to do any of this in -- I sew in the laundry room and while everything fits, it doesn't allow for much clutter which seems to accumulate every where I go.Because of this I have been doing a lot of reading about minimalism.  I have looked at lots of photos and read lots of blogs.  I have even referred back to one of our favorite books -- \"The Not So Big House\" by Sarah Susanka.  I have tried to employ the principals of minimalism -- if it isn't useful and you don't love it, toss it. That is difficult because I don't generally acquire things I don't like or aren't useful.  I have already gotten rid of almost every small appliance in this house and ALMOST went out and bought another rice cooker before I came to my senses. Another popular technique is to get rid of books and use an e-reader.  I have done some of that and I do enjoy reading some on the Nook but I still like books.  That creates another problem for me.  I have been known to go absolutely insane while standing at the sale table at our neighborhood B&N and buy books that I \"might\" read someday.  Well, I only have one bookcase dedicated to my own books and it is now double deep so I have taken some to my neighborhood Half Price Books.  However, I have been reading the Aunt Dimity series by Nancy Atherton and love, love, love the series.  I guess I had a weak moment while \"minimalizing\" my bookshelf and I took all my Aunt Dimity books to Half Price to sell.  Immediate regret!  So, I got online and bought them all back in hardback versions!  THAT is how I messed up!  However, I got ten hardback for $35 which wasn't a bad deal and I had earned half that from my paperbacks that I sold so I guess I didn't mess up completely!So, we have had a major ice storm here in DFW and I have been doing a lot of thinking about minimalism VS prepping.  I have always been one to prep for weather events because I have always lived someplace where we actually had weather events.  I don't worry too much about nuclear war and stuff like that but this ice storm -- quite another story.  So, I was thinking about how you could be a minimalist and a prepper at the same time and it dawned on me that you have to be minimalist thinking in order to be able to prep at all because if your house is full of clutter and stuff you don't use, you aren't going to have room to store the things you do need and be able to find the stuff when you need it -- like gloves for instance.  Yes, I know where my gloves are, thank you, but when fishing through the drawer for them it occurred to me that some organization was in order so, as soon as I can get out of here and go shopping, I intend to buy some organizers to get my stuff in order so I don't have to search for it.  Yes, I will probably have to get rid of some stuff -- like the half dozen socks with no mates -- and I will probably have to replace some stuff -- like the half dozen pairs of socks that are no longer pairs -- and I will probably have to do a good amount of rearranging because things are not stored very logically.  I do have to get the Vera Bradly purses out of the drawers and on the shelves which means I have to get rid of the purses that I don't use anymore into a box for Goodwill. Ah, yes, so that is what I have been thinking about while being housebound and it looks like tomorrow is going to be a very busy day with all the drawer cleaning and all."},

The wreath goes up this evening and the stockings will follow suit.  This season of Advent is so meaningful to me.  It is a time of quiet which I need.  It is a time of peace which I feel so strongly right now.  It is a time of new beginnings which I look forward to.  This Christmas is going to be different than the last several Christmases have been because I am different and I am thinking I like this new outlook."},

We didn't rush through Thanksgiving with the focus on going shopping at some ridiculous hour only to trample people for \"stuff\".  In my family we didn't even start thinking about Christmas until December! Imagine that.I went shopping this evening for an event at our church and I was appalled. My neighborhood Target looked like it had been ravaged by locusts and it didn't appear to be recovering.  Everything was completely picked over, shelves were empty, there was nothing to choose from and there was no evidence to suggest that there was any restocking planned. I mean, seriously?  It is only the beginning of December and I can't believe that everybody is done with their shopping.  What is going to happen to people who don't shop until mid-month, like when they get paid?  Not everybody like to shop for Christmas presents and Halloween simultaneously.  It was really depressing this evening. So, I have to ask -- is Black Friday necessary?"},

I don't want to look back at my time and see chaos.So, today as I blessed our wreath and shared the readings with my youngest granddaughter I took my time.  We didn't rush through, we talked about what I was saying and what the season meant.  We talked about Advent being a time of waiting for something wonderful to come, the birth of Baby Jesus.  I could almost feel time slow down.  It was such a wonderful feeling."},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, October 20, 2013", "text": "Minimalist MelissaLately I have been doing a lot of thinking about my possessions mostly because I am overwhelmed by them.  We don't have a large house and when we moved here we had a place for everything and things were organized and manageable.  However, in a mere seven years something dreadful has happened.One of the dreadful things that has happened is the sale table at Barnes and Noble.  I have a huge personal library that I will never read.  When I purchased a lot of the books, they seemed interesting but now, not so much.  So, in the last couple of weeks I have culled some of the books and taken them to my neighborhood Half Price Books to sell them.  I didn't get a lot for them but that is ok.  Yes, I could put them on Ebay and try to recoup what I paid for them but that is just an awful lot of bother, now, isn't it?  Other options are to offer them on Goodreads or donate to the library -- both options I might consider -- especially the library.  In any event, I need to make further strides in that area and keep the books that truly mean something to me.Another dreadful thing that has happened -- magazine subscriptions!  Somehow I have to get my husband to quit subscribing to magazines.  Really.  They are taking over the house! I also seem to have a problem with purses/handbags.  I put out a question on facebook yesterday asking if I were to only have one purse, what would my friends recommend.  I got a few responses -- all good -- and I think I am considering this:They come in three sizes and I will probably opt for the large considering I could use it as an overnighter if I chose to. It is weather proof nylon, lined and has leather trim.  It doesn't have lots of pockets inside which I always seem to gravitate toward yet never use. These bags are very popular on the East Coast and not so much here in the south, however, because they are lightweight and water-resistant, I think one would serve me well.  So, this might be on my Christmas list.  First, however, I need to go through my current pile of purses and sort things out.Shoes are not really an issue.  I used to love to buy shoes but not so much anymore.  I have a pair of black Clark's flats and a pair of tan -- exactly the same, very comfortable and very basic.  I have some sandals, one pair of athletic type shoes and one pair of top siders.  I have a pair of black heels but I don't wear them often.  I will keep them though, just in case the need arises.I have several silky blouses that are just too big and really, even though I am old, they just smack of \"old lady\" and they are going away.  Far, far away.  I have a few coordinated items with colored slacks and coordinating blouses -- too, too old lady for me.  So, they will be going.  I am shaping my wardrobe around the basic colors of navy, black, and gray -- I don't like khaki -- and intend to use some accent colors of red, turquoise and possibly pink.  I don't get dressed up anymore in dresses and I think I can dress up the other things I have to serve the purpose if I need to.  I have long comisserated the demise of our \"ladylike\" dress, complete with gloves but, now that I am living life in the slower, retired, more leisurely lane, I think I might actually enjoy no stockings and no gloves --- soft socks are really nice.   I might consider a black, straight skirt -- I might be able to do that.As I discussed in an earlier post, I am test driving a new makeup -- Rejuva Minerals and so far I like it.  I placed an order for two foundations, a blush and an eyeshadow.  The blush was not in the order and I called the number, got a real person -- a nice one -- and explained.  She explained to me why the blush was not there -- it was on backorder -- and she expected it to be in stock and shipped by Friday.  I received an email that it was shipped and I should receive it tomorrow.  The reviews of the mascara was very good and so, if I like the blush I will probably order the mascara and an eyeliner and purge the rest of my cosmetics.  I buy the stuff but don't wear it or wear it once or twice and don't like it and then it just piles up in the drawer because I feel bad about buying it and then just throwing it away.  Since I do believe that less is more as we age, I think this amount of makeup will do just fine and I can throw it in a makeup bag and take it with me if I so choose.  I still can't download a photo so visit the site at rejuvaminerals.com.I am looking for a new pair of dressy jeans and I think I am going to try the ones at Coldwater Creek.  I have seen them on and they are nice.So, that is what has been on my mind all this week.  Getting rid of things, paring down to what is important and meaningful and making my life easier on the whole.  Once it is done, I guess the trick is to keep up the process -- that may be harder than getting things done to begin with!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, October 16, 2013", "text": "New ApproachFor sometime I have been interested in a \"greener\" way of life and have been successful at effecting some change in my home.  I have either disposed of all plastic items or swapped out for a healthier option -- it seems that no matter how much I get rid of, I still have a need for some plastic but it is far less than I used to have.  I have experimented with making homemade laundry detergent which I still do and I prefer cooking from scratch with fresh ingredients rather than using processed foods.  My bread maker has had a good workout this past year although I have had to cut down on making bread because my diabetic husband can't seem to control himself and he over indulges.  However, because of the bread baking, I can't eat loaf bread anymore.  I just don't care for the taste.So, in light of recent health issues I have turned my attention to personal care products.  I have done quite a bit of reading on the chemicals that go into what we put on our skin and since our skin is our largest organ, everything that goes on also goes in.  I learned in high school that I am allergic to formaldehyde so I can't use nail polishes that contain formaldehyde so, rather than use and pay for a product that doesn't work very well, I opt to not use it at all.  Once in a while I will go for a pedi but not often.  I have never dyed my hair because I have always been concerned about the health concerns involved so I started turning gray at 19 and never covered it up.  I am still ok with that.So, that brings me to cosmetics and that is a whole new world of toxicity.  Now, I would love to just wash my face, moisturize and go but the reality is that I am a Baby Boomer and if I don't do a little something I run the risk of scaring small children while out and about.  However, I have pared down what I do.  I used to do a lot of exfoliation, cleansing, moisturizing, toning, and treating the wrinkles and fine lines which aren't so fine anymore.  However, after researching many of the drugstore brands I have pretty much banned all of them.  I have been using a lot of Origins products and I can't find much on cosmetic database sites about them so they probably won't be coming back into the house either.  So, I am using this: It is castile soap which has an oil base so I am not needing too much moisturizer and what I do use is Aveeno -- plain Aveeno without the soy.  It is working fine and I don't see any ill effects to my skin -- plus I feel squeaky clean.So, that brings us to makeup.  I have a love/hate relationship with makeup at best.  I love it.  I love to look at it, buy it, organize it but I don't love to use it.  However, there is that thing about scaring children so I need to do something.  I have tried many of the natural/organic makeups and they are all lacking in some way -- mostly that they aren't as natural/organic/pure as they claim to be.  So, after doing some research on www.ewg.org (cosmetic database) I chose to try Rejuva Minerals (www.rejuvaminerals.com)  and sent off for some of their samples.  I received them yesterday, minus one of the items (I don't know why) and I tried them for the first time this morning.  They have a large selection of colors and I, surprisingly, hit on one that works well.  I ordered two different shades but feel that one will be way too light and I haven't tried it yet.  I ordered an eye shadow and a blush but the blush wasn't included and I have sent an email to their customer service.  I hope to hear from them today.  So far my impression is favorable.  The packaging is very pretty -- little cardboard containers with sifter lids.  The product went on well and I haven't itched or gotten red at all.  There doesn't seem to be any scent to it, or none that I have picked up on -- that means I don't smell like dirt.  I wish I could download a photo  because they are really adorable little boxes.  The samples are a bit pricey -- $10 but there is a lot of product in there and definitely worth it.   Since I don't wear makeup every day the sample will last me a while.  If I like the blush when I get it I am going to try the mascara and then will probably purge my entire stash and just switch over.  That approach fits my new \"minimalist\" mindset and I will be glad to have less to keep up with, especially if these new products fill the bill.I have been following a blog -- becomingminimalist.com - and it is very interesting and informative with lots of idea about how to simplify your life and declutter.  I have started paring down in many areas and will continue to do so as I like the peace and quiet of having what I need and nothing more.  But...that is another blog entry.To South Carolina I have been enjoying the novels of Dorothea Benton Frank since earlier in the year when I listened to \"Pawley's Island\" on audio book while commuting to my daughter's house daily.  Shopping my own bookshelves -- I always have unread books there waiting for me -- I noticed that I had picked up a copy of \"Return to Sullivan's Island\" sometime back and since it is the second in a series I decided to pick up the first book and read it.  \"Sullivan's Island\" was a great read for me -- it switched back and forth between the present and the past -- the past being in the 50's and 60's which brought back memories for me.  It was a very engaging book and I enjoyed it very much but I always enjoy books about families and interpersonal relationships and how they deal with difficulty.  So, when done, I immediately picked up \"Return to Sullivan's Island\". It takes up with all the children in the first book grown with families of their own.  The main character is Beth -- the daughter of Susan, the main character in the first book.  This book is a bit more light hearted with a bit more comic relief even though Beth goes through some rather difficult growing pains.  This is a great book for curling up with on a cool, rainy day because it is an easy book to get \"into\".  Both books are easy to get into, actually, and I high recommend them both.I have to say that reading these books about the Lowcountry have made me want to visit Charleston, SC.  I must be on the right track because in a survey discussed on the \"Today\" show this morning says that Charleston is the number  one choice for smaller city vacation spots."},

So, I decided I would try Nancy Drew again and have been completely drawn in.  I had quite a few Nancy Drew books from a book club I belonged to but I could never get \"into\" them.  My mom read them, my aunt read them, my grandmother read them but I didn't.  However I decided to give them another chance for this challenge and I am really enjoying them.  Today I finished \"The Case of the Hidden Staircase\".  It was really good and a little spooky.  I really enjoy the settings in these books -- I mean, who doesn't like big mansions with antiques and secret doors and, yes, hidden staircases.  There is just enough intrigue to make you keep reading but not so much to be frightening to younger readers.  They do hold an adults interest and they are very quick reads.  I would recommend to anybody who wants something light that takes you back in time a bit.So, after finishing \"The Case of the Hidden Staircase\" I immediately bought the next one in the series for my Nook.  I will be starting \"The Bungalow Mystery\" tonight!  Review to follow."},

My mother loved them and my aunt loved them but me -- yeah, not so much.  However, I revisited them for the book challenge and I was completely taken in by this story and would definitely recommend it.  In fact, I am looking forward to the next title in the series -- The Case of the Hidden Staircase."},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, September 02, 2013", "text": "All Things Family HistoryI have done genealogy for years -- absolutely years.  I have never, up until now, figured out how to store and organize all the documentation that goes along with it.  I didn't think up the system on my own, I stole it from somebody on YouTube and, I will say, she did a much better job of it than I have.I have tried everything from file cabinets to notebooks to folders to electronic programs and nothing seems to work for me as well as I would like.  So, when I went looking for a \"new\" way to do things, I had an open mind and a good thing, too, because I watched this woman organized her records and was slapped in the face by the simplicity of it all.  Why hadn't I thought of it?The whole idea is filing documentation, in pendaflex folders in portable, plastic file boxes, by the individual.  Each person in your tree has a folder and whatever information you have on that person goes in his/her file.  They are arranged in the file box just like they appear on your ancestor chart.  By doing it this way you have ready access to whatever you have on any person and you can readily see if you need to find a document to add more information to your tree.  Before I tried keeping all my death/birth certificates (and other documents in like fashion) in one folder labelled as such and I had to sift through all of them in order to find one particular one.  This was time consuming and also meant I handled the documents more than necessary.  Those things are expensive so you really don't want to handle them more than you need to.Now, the lady on the YouTube video did hers with more panache than I have.  I have been reusing file folders that have been used before, not caring if they were color coordinated.  This lady used blue for her male ancestors and pink for her female ancestors.  It looks really nice when put together but, since I have been going \"green\" for a while, I saw no sense in repurchasing what I already had. As I sat and worked on this today, totally trashing my dining room table, I was amazed at the amount of information I have amassed on all those who went before me.  A good deal of it I had forgotten I had.  I was surprised at some of the information and was able to add it to my tree on Ancestry.com right away before I filed it away.  I discovered some copies of pictures that I mulled over for a while -- I never knew these relatives but I feel like I do.  I finally feel like I am getting all my information in some sort of workable order.  Genealogy is a great hobby but, when you get past the four or five generations, the volume of information becomes almost uncontrollable and almost takes on a life of its own.  I feel like I might actually have a shot at taming the beast with this system.  In the new system, it will be so nice to be able to pull a folder and look over the contents without having to sort through tons of material to find something.  Yes, I think this will work.I have abandoned the project for the evening -- the dust from the paper is making my nose run and I don't need that -- so tomorrow is another day and I will continue then.  I don't want to rush through this process, I want to enjoy it and relish the past.  My mother always chastised my dad for \"living in the past\" and I guess, to some extent, I do the same but some days, the past is just the place I need to be."},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, September 01, 2013", "text": "Still Here -- Just TiredHi, all! I am still here -- just a little tired.  Things have been very busy lately what with babysitting the Bean and taking care of my health -- both very tiring activities.  I find that when I return home of an evening about all I can do is a shower, a bit of reality tv, some facebook and then I am down for the count.Speaking of reality tv, I have somehow morphed into watching Honey Boo Boo.  Why you ask?  I have no clue.  This isn't my usual sort of viewing pleasure.  I love the Smithsonian Channel, PBS, The Learning Channel but not Honey Boo Boo.  I have to say, though, it is the ultimate diversion.  For sure.Facebook has taken on a different approach for me.  I have a love hate relationship with FB -- I really don't like some of the political stuff on there but I have really enjoyed reacquainting myself with people I went through school with.  We have talked about our present lives and we have talked about our childhoods and taken walks down memory lane, dredging up old memories and having a lot of laughs over it.  We have watched our elementary school be torn down -- much to our dismay -- and we have wondered where others are that we haven't heard from in many years.After one of those walks down memory lane, I seemed to stay on the path for a while.  I was trying to find my  \"happy place\" and I did -- in the library of my junior high school.  In a previous post, or two, I have discussed attending a \"historical\" school on a main street that led to downtown San Antonio, in a beautiful, historic neighborhood with gorgeous homes called Monte Vista. The school was built in 1923 and many of my family members attended.  It was, in my mind, a beautiful school -- on the outside.  It has been described as a bit \"prison-like\" on the inside, however, but I never felt that way.  As one who always loved old architecture, I just loved the dark woodwork, the transom windows, the mullioned floor to ceiling windows and the library.  The first floor windows in the photo above are that very library.  Those windows look out on San Pedro and into the neighborhood of beautiful homes across the street.Now, I always wanted to be a writer and I would spend many long study hall periods studying each house I could see and making up stories of the families that lived in each house.  The stories became very elaborate in my mind but I never seemed to write them down.  What a shame because I believe that they were very good -- in my 14 year old mind.During this same time, my father was dabbling in movie making.  He created a film that used almost all local talent including a young college student named Helen Hogan.My twelve year old self thought Miss Hogan was wonderful.  She was elegant, poised,  pretty, and thin!.  She was active in the San Antonio Little Theater scene along with several of the other cast members.  I thought the little theater life was the most glamorous even though I had only been in the theater once for a piano recital.  So, the movie making came and went, as did the cast members.  I grew up and never gave all that much thought until I was recently asked what happened to all those people.  So, the genealogist in me went on a hunt for those elusive cast members.  I knew a several had passed away, one had moved far away and then there was Helen Hogan.  A quick search and I learned that she had married in the 1990's and was living -- yes, in one of those houses that I had made up a story about! No, none of my stories ever centered around a young socialite of means, a debutant, a budding actress who was active on the civic front and enjoyed starring in her university's dramatic performances.  But, maybe one should have -- sounds like a pretty nice story to me."},

I have tried everything I know but it just won't get added to my \"read\" list.The book is titled \"West of the Creek:  Murder, Mayhem and Vice in Old San Antonio\".  It is a small book with 35 stories about all sorts of scandalous activities in San Antonio from the early days until the 30's and 40's.  Now, I recognize that this isn't a book for everybody but being from San Antonio and doing lots of family research in the area, I found it to be a really interesting read.  I was curious because, when I worked downtown just south of Hemisfair Plaza, my mother was horrified that my place of business was actually in a section of what used to the the old \"red light\" district.  I laughed but one day I was there late, by myself until my husband could pick me up, and the neighborhood definitely took on another feel at dusk.  Ghosts, maybe?  Ha! The book was very interesting when I looked at where events took place or where businesses were located and they were areas that I am familiar with and had no idea that shady things had once gone on there!Anyway, this was my 20th book for my Goodreads 2013 Reading Challenge and I can't get it to post!  Grrrr!"},

Chest pains.  Yes, I was going to the doctor right after the planned trip to San Antonio on July 8.The trip to San Antonio came and went and I wasn't able to participate much because of the aforementioned symptoms.  During one sight seeing venture, I just stayed in the hotel room.  We came home.  Truly, the daughter shouldn't have gone either as she was having trouble eating from the surgery. I made and went to the dr. appointment as I said I would. I still felt horrible but he said everything sounded fine and looked good.  This was on Wednesday.  On Thursday I was sent to the hospital because my hemoglobin was half what it should be. I received four pints of blood.  When the doctor started quizzing me I mentioned that I had never been through menopause and immediately a gyno was called in and in very short order I had an exam, a sonogram, a biopsy and a referral to a gynecological oncologist.  The next week I had a hysterectomy, a pathology report that declared everything negative but one lymph node and because of that one lymph node and the fact that the type of malignancy tends to be a bit aggressive,  I will be starting a  twelve week stint of chemo starting on August 19.  This blog is primarily a book blog, a Bean blog, sometimes a travel blog, sometimes a rant/vent blog.  What it will never be is a political blog or a cancer blog.  I am upbeat, I think things will go well, I have faith in the doctor and in my God and I will not allow this to define me.  I have not discussed this on Facebook and will not do so -- I have talked to the people that I feel need to know and that is where I am leaving it.  I just wanted my bloggy friends to know why I haven't been here for a while and also that I feel really good, have a very positive outlook and feel that things are going to go well for me.  So, on that note, I would like to add that I have been doing a LOT of reading during all of this -- I finished \"Sullivan's Island\" and am half way through \"Return to Sullivan's Island\".  They are fantastic reads and I recommend to everyone."},

I go.That is why I have been absent here but that is temporary.  I will be back with more boring posts as soon as I have all this sorted out.  Or, maybe later to post some vacation pics."},

Beaton's \"A Highland Christmas\".When I say it was a \"find\" I meant it-- literally.  I had checked this book out from the library via my Nook.  It was my first library book on the e-reader and, as I was finishing up some other reads, I didn't have time to finish it before it was due to be returned so I decided to purchase the book.  I went to my local B&N to find it and, for the life of me, I couldn't find any of the Beaton books.  Yes, yes, I know, I could have asked but asking for help in a bookstore for me is like a guy asking for directions while driving -- isn't going to happen.  Somehow I managed to find the books and I honestly don't know how they were shelved -- they just didn't seem to be in the correct place but I DID find them but not this title. Looking down at the lowest shelf, behind another title by another author, I found this little bitty book.  Was it shelved wrong or did somebody hide it there to be picked up later?  Who knows but the bigger question is-- this is such a short book why didn't I finish it before it was due at the library?  Anyway, I have the book and will be finishing it now.  As far as \"discovering\" a new read, I have to say that I discovered this entire series and look forward to enjoying it as much as the Aunt Dimity series.Books and Movies and Books -- Oh My!Life here at Casita de Brinkley is pretty ordinary -- we aren't trail blazing people! The Hubs has his cameras and his woodworking, and the ever-present vine in the garden to pull out.  I have my quilting and cross stitching (both of which have gone dormant at the moment) and my books and vintage movie viewing.  Of course there are the everyday things of life like laundry and dishes which are a totally different blog -- NEVER!During my time of babysitting this past school year, reading has become my go-to activity because it doesn't require hauling a lot of stuff or making a mess as sewing projects have a tendency to do.   I have explored audio books as well as e-books.  It has been really nice having a chunk of time each day that I can devote to reading and not feel guilty about taking time away from something else more important (read:  laundry and dishes). The audio books definitely made the commute more relaxing.  Now that I am home for the summer I am not only reading, I am able to enjoy my other guilty pleasure -- watching vintage movies. The first audio book I listened to was \"Folly Beach\" authored by Dorothea Benton Frank and read by Robin Miles.  The book made several references to a Fanny Hurst book \"Imitation of Life\". Since the 1950's movie by the same title is one of my favorite movies (yes, I saw it as a 9 year old in the theater -- we didn't have movie ratings at the time) I was compelled to purchase the book and it is now in my reading queue.So, night before last I found myself curled up on the couch, in a quilt, watching (read: weeping) \"Imitation of Life\" once again.It never loses it's appeal for me and I just can't wait to start the book!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, June 10, 2013", "text": "Very Strange DayI have spent the last nine months caring for my youngest grandchild while her mother teachers high school English.  Today is my first weekday at home and it feels very strange.  I am very used to the routine that we have developed and I miss her but it is time for her to have Mommy time.  So, what am I doing with my day, you might say.  Well, the stock answer for everything is \"laundry\".  Yes, I am doing laundry and, while it isn't my favorite chore, it does feel good to see the accomplishment of having the laundry pile dwindle. I have also taken the time to blog my book reviews before I forgot what I read and now I have taken the time, between laundry loads, to watch a couple of old movies.   I absolutely love vintage movies and watch them every time I get a chance. Today I viewed \"Not As A Stranger\" starring Frank Sinatra, Robert Mitchum and Olivia de Havilland.  It was the 1955 Stanley Kramer production based on the 1954 book by Morton Thompson.  What can I say -- what is not to like about a youngish Sinatra and Mitchum.Now I am watching \"The Miracle Worker\" with Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke.  The 1962 movie, based on the 1959 play by the same name that originated as a 1957 episode on Playhouse 90.  I saw this movie when it first came out and was immediately taken with Helen Keller and did much reading on her life and her accomplishments.  Even today, when asked, I have to say that she was one of the most inspiring public figures I had ever learned about. So, what does my afternoon hold for me?  Hmmm...I don't know, maybe a little Sprout or Disney Channel.  I think this is going to be a bigger adjustment for me than it is for the munchkin!Musing Monday - June 10, 2013The questions of \"what am I currently reading\" and \"what have I recently bought\" sort of go together this week.  I am currently reading \"Sullivan's Island\" by Dorothea Benton Frank.  I originally purchased this for my Nook but, after getting aggravated about always needing to charge the thing, I opted to buy the book.One of the problems I have with e-readers is, while you can see what page you are on, you can't \"see\" how far you have gotten in the book.  I was surprised to see how far I had gotten on the Nook when I found my place in the physical book.Yesterday, while at B&N, I also bought \"The Secret of the Old Clock\".  This is the first in the Nancy Drew series and I decided this would be my next choice for the children's book challenge I am participating in.  I didn't read much Nancy Drew when I was growing up -- just didn't like mysteries but I think now, as an adult, I am really going to enjoy it.Last week I also learned how to check out books from the library using my Nook.  The title I chose was \"A Highland Christmas\" by M. C. Beaton.  The checkout time is fairly limited so I am not sure I will get this one finished before I have to return it but I am enjoying the Hamish Macbeth series so I will probably have check it out again."},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, June 09, 2013", "text": "Book ReviewsIn recent news, it has been brought to our attention that the US government has been spying on us -- yes, American citizens.  I understand the explanation why -- sort of -- but it still makes my skin crawl.  I have had friends say they are going to go back to using paper to write communication instead of email which I think is a lovely idea if we can get past the need for instant gratification.  Of course, a lot of folks will have to brush up on their handwriting skills for sure but I think actually sitting down and writing a note sounds refreshing.  I don't send a lot of emails so I am not too worried about being spied on in that respect.  If somebody wants to check my shopping habits well, there isn't too much covert operation going on there, either -- a bit of surfing at Vera Bradley and Barnes and Noble and some clothing shopping -- and really, who cares if the world knows what size underwear I wear -- I have recently lost over 25 lbs. so I am sort of proud of the fact that I will be shopping for new unmentionables in a smaller size -- shout it to the rooftops.  That brings us to my blog.  I thought about how blogs are being watched and recorded and kept and if there is a file for interesting blogs and boring blogs and decided that mine would file nicely under \"boring\" and since I mostly post book reviews and sometimes the random snowfall snap, I doubt I am going to be put on some sort of \"watch\" list.  If I am then they need to re-evaluate their system because they are watching the wrong person.  So, that leads into my current blog on book reviews -- I am behind and this is an effort to catch up so the reviews won't be lengthy.I have been enjoying several formats for reading lately -- books, ebooks, and audio books during my commute.  I have come to realize that of the three, I prefer physical books and audio books.  I discovered that the library, at least Summerglen Branch, has a huge assortment of audio books and, since audio books are pricey to purchase, they are free and that is even better!The Runaway Quilt - Jennifer ChiaveriniThis title is part of the Elm Creek Quilts series by Jennifer Chiaverini.  In this particular story, Sylvia Compton is approached by a stranger at a quilt show who asks about a quilt in her possession named after Elm Creek and she wonders if it is connected to the Elm Creek mansion that belongs to Sylvia.  The question sparks Sylvia's inquisitive nature and after searching the attic for a trunk, Sylvia discovers some old quilts and a journal that sheds light on a lot of things including the stran -gers quilt.  It is part history, part mystery and all enjoyable.  I recommend.Austenland - Shannon HaleI don't read much \"chick-lit\" but I found this on audio book and decided it would be something really fun and light to listen to  on my commute and I was right.  The main character has a lot of back luck in love because, being obsessed with Jane Austen's Mr. Darcy, she compares every man in her life to HIM and they all fall short.  So, upon the death of her great-aunt, she receives as an inheritance, a vacation to Austenland, a reality, living history amusement park sort of place that she is to visit for three weeks and hopefully have an attitude adjustment.  She goes, she participates, she does a lot of soul searching and does, indeed, adjust her attitude and her life accordingly.  It was fun -- I recomment.Porch Lights - Dorothea Benton FrankFranks books seem to be very formulaic and this one is no different. The main character, a thirty-something nurse in the military with a fire fighter husband and a ten year old boy loses her husband in a fire while she is stationed in the Middle East.  She comes home to an a life that has been abruptly altered while she wasn't even there, a very depressed child, and the idea that she has no idea what to do so she retreats to her mother's house in the Low Country only to find that her mother is entranced by the doctor next door, her father now spends all his time in his \"alternate residence\" in the next town and her son doesn't want to go back to their home in New York.  It all works out as you know it would, it has a happy ending -- and a scary hurricane -- but it is a feel good book and one you can curl up and get \"into\".  I recommend.The Christmas Blizzard - Garrison KeillorWhat can I say -- this is Garrison Keillor's answer to \"A Christmas Carol\".  It was another audio book and I have to say that I found myself laughing out loud, all by myself, in the car at 6 a.m.  It was fun, it was odd, it was strangely insightful and  I enjoyed it and I recommend it -- actually, I don't know about the physical book but I really enjoyed the audio book, read by the author - very good.Life Class - Pat BarkerAnother audio book, this was the story of three friends in art school at the beginning of World War I.  As could be expected the three friends form a love triangle.  The war takes is toll on the trio in different ways -- it is sad, it is frustrating, and you just get sort of angry at the girl because she seems to be playing both guys against each other while being the quintessential \"artist\".  It was good but it was sad but still a definite recommend.Death of a Village - M. C. BeatonIf you read my blog you know that I absolutely love the Aunt Dimity mystery series.  I was never much of a mystery reader until I discovered those and I am still reading that series.  So, while looking for yet another audio book I ran across the M. C. Beaton books on CD and decided to give one a go so I chose \"Death of a Village\" and now I am just as taken with these as the Dimity series.  The best way to describe this story is \"George Gently\" meets \"Waiting for God\".  It was funny, in a way, and you had to fall for the bumbling, affable Hamish Macbeth.  I have a mental picture of the tall, lanky, ginger haired copper that, while seems to be a great policeman, seems to lack a lot of pizazz with the ladies.  It was really good and I am now reading another title in the series on my Nook - one that I actually checked out of the library on my e-reader -- a new talent I just discovered! I recommend \"Death of a Village\" and I will review the next one when I get done.This year I have engaged myself in two book challenges  -- the Goodreads 2013 Book Challenge which I signed up to read 20 books, 17 of which I have completed.  They suggest that I \"up\" my goal but I think not, I think I will just enjoy my summer of reading and not worry about a challenge.  I have also signed up for the Pre-1960 Children's Book Challenge of which I have only read two.  I would like to enjoy this challenge a bit more during the summer -- I have the burning desire to read \"Little Women\" yet again -- I will  probably revisit some of my childhood favorites -- most of which were published before 1960 and I will review here.So, as my summer begins I wish all of you a happy summer!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, April 26, 2013", "text": "More Book Reviews It seems as if my eclectic, mish mash of a blog is turning into a book blog.  I guess that is because that is what I am doing most of the time these days.  Besides, who blogs about laundry.  Yeah.So, in the past couple of weeks I have enjoyed three books, one being an audio book.  While I am using the audiobooks to make my commute more pleasant, I am also trying to work through my personal library which has many more unread books than read books.  I am discovering that, while I always thought I had to keep every book that found its way across my threshold, I don't.  I have come across several that will be going to my local used bookstore even though I will probably only get about 30 cents for them.  Maybe I should just donate them to the library -- that sounds like a better thing to do.I digress.The first book that I have added to my list on Goodreads is \"Garden Spells\" by Sarah Addison Allen.I have had this book on my shelves for a long time and is one of those that I purchased for the cover -- yes, I actually do that -- my bad.  At one point, last year,  I decided to alphabetize my shelves by author so this book was at the very top, sort of hidden.  When I decided to start at the beginning and just read my way through the shelves, this is where I started.  I am not too much of a fan of the paranormal because if it isn't done right it just becomes stupid (read \"Bramwell Valley\") and I didn't know what to expect of this work -- it could have gone either way in my opinion.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find a bevy of great characters, a storyline that wasn't too bizarre and a happy ending.  The story centers around Clare, an attractive yet reclusive young woman.  Never feeling like she fit in she built a world around herself, allowing herself to live in the small town yet be apart from it.  Her sister, who left home at an early age, turns up on her front porch on day with a daughter in tow which was a surprise to Clare because she had no idea what her sister had been up to for the last ten years.  She soon found out as bits and pieces of her sister's life surfaced, along with a very angry, ex-almost-husband.  There is romance, drama, a bit of the mystical all woven into an entertaining story.  Like I said, it could have turned into a silly witch hunt but it didn't.  It progressed well and ended well.  Again, the paranormal genre is not my favorite but I did enjoy this book and would recommend it.Pawleys Island is the second audio book I have listened to by Dorothea Benton Frank.  The first won my rave review because it was so excellently read, or rather performed, by Robin Miles.  This one didn't have the advantage of exemplary reading -- it was adequate but not the same experience -- but the book was very enjoyable anyway and I would recommend.  It centers around Rebecca Sims, her brute of a husband and their two children.  Rebecca has retreated to Pawleys Island after her abusive husband has soured her children against her, tried to declare her an unfit mother, taken her house and sued her for divorce.  Upon her arrival at her friend's condo, she obtains a job as a framer in Huey's art gallery and meets Abigail Thurmond, a ruthless divorce attorney trying to recover from the loss of her husband and only son.  As the book progresses Abigail and Rebecca become good friends, Abigail replaces Rebecca's hapless attorney and turns her husband every which way but loose, romances are rekindled, new ones started, children are returned home, new beginnings, etc, etc,.  It was good even though I am beginning to see Frank's books as being very formulaic.  This would make a good made-for-tv movie -- I see Judith Light as Abigail Thurmond and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Huey.  It would be very entertaining.  My next audiobook is another of hers, also read by Robin Miles, \"Porch Lights\".  I will review when I have listened to it.The final book for this review I just finished this morning -- \"The Runaway Quilt\" by Jennifer Chiaverini.  This is the fourth book in the Elm Creek Quilts series and deals with the question of quilts being used during the Civil War as signals in the Underground Railroad.  Of course, that isn't the whole of the story -- this tale delves into the background of Sylvia Compson's family -- the Bergstrom family.  Sylvia is the descendant of Hans and Anneke Bergstrom and the sole heir to their homestead Elm Creek Manor where she operates her quilt camps.  As a child she fell heir to a key that opened a hope chest belonging to her great-aunt Gerda Bergstrom.  The chest was somewhere in the attic and not thought  of until Sylvia was approached by a woman at a quilt lecture who was looking for help in identifying a quilt that she felt was connected to Sylvia -- possibly connecting the families. Key in hand, Sylvia searches for and finds the chest and begins to explore the contents -- three very worn quilts and a journal.   The quilts in the hope chest were a mystery that Sylvia hoped would be solved by the journal. After much genealogical research, the origin of the quilt in question was discovered and several questions raised by Gerda's journal were answered as well except for one --  is Sylvia Bergstrom really a Bergstrom at all.   This book is a great escape for quilters and genealogists (i.e. me) and it was so enjoyable I couldn't put it down and then regretted it being finished.  This is a definite recommend -- I might even read it again."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, April 22, 2013", "text": "Musing Mondays is hosted by Miz B at  Should Be Reading.  Today I am going to tell you all about my recent book purchases.  There are quite a few.As I have mentioned in a past blog, I recently listened to \"Folly Beach\" on audio book and there were several mentions of \"Imitation of Life\" by Fanny Hurst.  Now I have seen the Lana Turner/Sandra Dee version of the movie many times but never thought about reading the book.  However, it being mentioned in this book sparked my interest so I ordered it from Barnes and  Noble.  At the same time I purchased \"Aunt Dimity Next of Kin\".  This is the next book in my Aunt Dimity queue and I haven't been able to find it locally so I ordered it as well.  I happened upon a gift card that I didn't know I had so I used it to purchase \"The Runaway Quilt\" -- the next in the Elm Creek Quilt series.I have been listening to audio books on my commute and I like to buy them used so I visited Half Price Books close to my daughter's house.  I have bought the ones I have at other branches of this same store but there wasn't a lot of inventory.  However, there were several offerings at this particular store so I hit pay dirt.  I bought \"Austenland\", \"Life Class\" by Pat Barker (BBC audio) and \"A Christmas Blizzard\" by Garrison Keillor.  The set of CD's by Keillor originally retained for $27 and I got it for $6.99 and it is brand new and unopened so....always check the used bookstores FIRST.So, that is my recent acquisition!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, April 18, 2013", "text": "Why ...I have always been an anxious person.  I was raised in a home that did not shield me from the things of life -- deaths, fires, accidents, job losses, friend losses, rejection, tornadoes -- you know -- everyday life.  Perhaps these occurrences contributed to my lifelong anxiety, they probably did (especially in the case of fire) but my parents always tried to use these things as a learning opportunity and I have to say that I think I am a stronger person and I never once felt that I wasn't being protected by my family. And then...there were the disaster drills at school, in the 50's, when we were supposed to  was crawl under our desks in the event of a nuclear disaster.  I remember my mother telling me that if anything happened when I was in school and I looked outside and saw a big cloud that looked like a mushroom, don't go outside.  Really?  Don't go outside?  Get under the desk?  All of a sudden I felt very unprotected -- my parents couldn't protect me from THAT! People were buying bomb shelters and having them installed in the yard.  I wanted one and I never wanted to go to school again and I found myself looking outside at the clouds -- a lot.  I was officially a nervous person.The next time I felt completely out of control of my existence was during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.  With good reason I was pretty scared.  Home was San Antonio which was also home to five military bases -- a pretty significant target.  Schools were closed, we stocked up and stayed in with the tv going.  I was looking out the windows at clouds.  We were fine except for the bit of innocence lost.As I ventured into high school and college we were in the Viet Nam era with all the political ramifications of the times.  I remember one of my high school dances having to be moved due to bomb threats and there was one sociology class that was finally cancelled because we never had a class that was uninterrupted by a bomb threat and evacuation.  I remember one such evacuation, we were told to leave via the stairwells and not the escalators -- ha! I went down the escalator and was reprimanded by a cop who had been a high school friend -- I told him that I would rather get blown up on the escalator than  get trampled to death on the stairs -- oh, did I mention he was very cute.  He shall remain nameless.  Was I afraid?  Well, initially, yes but after so many times it is like crying wolf.  Besides,  this was the 60's -- great music, great clothes, great dates -- who had time to worry about stuff like that when  we were, after all, invincible.Then came the 70's and I was grown with babes of my own and my first huge fear was of a meteor or space junk that was supposed to hit the earth someplace.  I was pregnant.  My OB-GYN thought I was crazy and actually laughed at me.  I was petrified.  It didn't fall on me -- in fact, I don't really remember what happened -- but I was unscathed and a bit ashamed of the actual fear that had come over me.Life has gone on.  I have lived through much more of the \"life stuff\" and I have seen so much more.  Am I afraid?  No, not any more.  I am, however, disgusted.  Really so disgusted.  What in the world is wrong with people?  Why don't people appreciate what we have in this world?  Why are people so hell bent on destroying everything? It makes me sick."},

{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, April 14, 2013", "text": "WOW!Yes, indeed, wow!  As you probably know, I have a long commute each day and, being the anxious soul that I am, I am always looking for ways to make it easier or more enjoyable.  In my youth I loved to listen to rock and roll music and sing along in my off key, monotone shrill, preferably with the windows up so my teased, sprayed \"bubble\" do wouldn't move an inch.  Or a quarter of an inch.  Anyway, those days are gone.  No, I don't sing any better but the love of rock and roll music has diminished and the hair has revolted and taken on a life of its own.  I still  like the music of the 60's as much as I ever did but it sets my teeth on edge to listen to the \"oldies\" station and only hear music of the 90's.  There is a station -- KAAM -- that plays REALLY old music, like from my babyhood, but the reception isn't so great.So, I moved on to conservative talk radio.  Yes, I am conservative in my political views, for what political views I have.  I am pretty much blah about it all but I thought maybe listening to \"talk\" would be easier to listen to than \"squawk\".  WRONG.  Oh, listening to it was fine but by the time I got home I was either so depressed or so angry that I discovered that it wasn't helping my commute at all.What to do?  Well, my son used to listed to books on CD so I thought I would give it a try.   Off to my neighborhood used book store to score a copy of something.  I looked at what they had to offer -- not a bad selection but my goodness -- the price on those puppies, even used! My eyes rested on a \"copy\" of \"Folly Beach\".  I had looked at the book in B&N many times, only to put it back.  Then I looked at it on the sale table at B&N, only to put it back but I took a longer look at this little box of CD's.  Mostly at the price.  $4.99.  Yep, I thought it looked like a great introduction into audio books.I was right.  I don't know what it was but this was a fabulous experience.  It was read by Robin Miles, an actress who has devoted much time to reading books for the blind.  Her voice, with her soft, flowing southern accent reminded me or Werther's Original caramel candy.  Her voice changed with the characters so there was never any trouble following the storyline.  She didn't read this book, she \"acted\" this book.  It reminded me of old time radio programs.  It was so smooth and so entertaining that I was sad when it ended. The story was actually two plots in one -- the story of Cate Cooper and her rise from the ashes of what was her marriage after the suicide of her philandering husband, Addison Cooper  and the story of Dorothy Heywood, wife of Dubose Heywood, and her collaboration with her husband and George Gershwin in the writing of \"Porgy and Bess\"  --as written by Cate Cooper.  Technically I guess this could be called historical fiction because the story about the Heywoods and Gershwin, was true.  Dorothea Benton Frank did  a fantastic job of weaving the stories of these two women together -- one fictional, one real -- and bringing all the lush scenery and atmosphere into play as well.  Add in a few \"characters\" like Ella and Aunt Daisy, a bit of controversy like Ella and Aunt Daisy, an annoying daughter-in-law Alice, neurotic daughter Sarah and introduce a bit of  sauciness to Cate  and you have all the makings of a great \"southern\" novel.So, I was in B&N the other day and there it was, this glorious piece of fiction, on the sale table again and I really wanted to buy it for my personal library but I put it down, yet again. I decided that my CD's would have to go on the shelf instead because I don't think reading the book would have the same impact as listening to Robin Miles' beautiful voice.  This is one I might actually have to listen to again!BTW -- it was a wonderful solution to my travelling problem -- I don't think Mark Levin will miss me, do you?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, April 07, 2013", "text": "Recent PurchaseI buy the oddest,most random most unusual, interesting things online.  This is my latest purchase -- a wool dust mop made in the USA.  Most of my floors are bare, which I like, and I have a lovely vacuum cleaner but there are sometimes when I just don't want to drag the lovely vacuum cleaner all over the house so I decided to channel my mother and buy a dust mop (she loved her dust mop).  Yes, I have a swiffer but those things are just too tiny and they  don't cover enough space at one time.  This mop is 11 X 18 and just about makes short work of dusting up the floor.  Of course, it won't pick up big stuff like twist  ties, runaway olives, and general junk (i.e. leggos) like a vacuum will but I consider it exercise to bend over and pick up the big stuff.  I was very pleased to see the colorful mop head and for some reason it reminded my of my substitute grandmother -- I have no idea why.  The head is 100% wool and the whole thing was made in the US which made me happy because I always try to buy domestically if I can.I was impressed with the dust mop enough to run out and buy one of theseI used to own several of these but they got thrown out during a move and I never replaced them.  So, off to Ace Hardware I went, came home and took the little duster to the shutters and I was thrilled.  I actually enjoyed doing this little chore and it didn't wear me out like having to hold a heavy vacuum cleaner wand up in the air.So, all this travelling back to cleaning methods of my youth has me rethinking the laundry airer I had looked at months ago.  If I thought my hubby could hang it up without destroying the ceiling  I would have one in a minute.  I might have to revisit this idea because there are just some clothes I prefer to hang. Ok, off to surf the net looking for airers.  I am so easily amused."},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, April 06, 2013", "text": "Reading UpdateIt has been a very good week (or so) of reading.  I have finished three books for two challenges.  I am participating in the Goodreads 2013 Reading Challenge and the 2013 Pre-1960 Childrens Book Reading Challenge hosted by turningthepagesx.blogspot.com.  I don't know whether I am just reading faster or if I am just choosing books that are quick reads but I have been truckin' right along with the 2013 Goodreads Reading Challenge.  This go around I finished The Cross Country Quilters by Jennifer Chiaverini, Aunt Dimity Takes a Holiday by Nancy Atherton and The Bobbsey Twins at London Tower by Laura Lee Hope. The Cross Country Quilters is the third in the Chiaverini series about the Elm Creek Quilters.  I like how the first book was about the beginning of the Elm Creek Mansion and all the back history and the books expand to include the stories of the campers at the quilt camps held by Sylvia Compson and her friend and substitute daughter, Sarah McClure.  Each of these individual stories start at Elm Creek Manor, the idyllic home of the Elm Creek Quilters and the camp, and take the reader away from the camp into the environment of the characters and they all end up back at the camp at the end.  While the reader might not identify with every character and their situation, there is always one that comes home in the readers mind.  These are great books, very comfortable yet thought provoking, set in a wonderful setting that takes you to another place for a little while as you watch the characters deal with and solve contemporary problems.  Great reads, for sure.The next adult book I read was Aunt Dimity Takes a Holiday by Nancy Atherton.  This is part of the Aunt Dimity series and followed true to the series.  The main characters are Lori Shepherd, her husband Bill Willis, Emma and Derek Harris and their children and, of course, the sweet, loveable, brilliant yet slightly dead Aunt Dimity.  This book follows the tale of Derek Harris who is the slightly mysterious owner of Anscombe Manor -- well, he wasn't so mysterious until his wife Emma discovered there was another side to him  -- and another name! Yes, well, that is all that  I am going to say except that this episode in the series involves children's nurseries, poison-pen letters, secrets and burning bushes.  Yes, it was good -- read it for yourself and see.The book that I read for the childrens book challenge was The Bobbsey Twins at London Tower.  My copy wasn't this colorful version but rather the faded green fabric of all my other BT books.  However, I think they might have had dust covers which I believe this is a photo of.  I chose to use this photo as it is a bit more colorful and I think my original copy might have been this one.  In any event, it was published in 1959 and I received a copy right off the presses.  I was an Anglophile even back then and absolutely inhaled this book.  Reading it as an adult I enjoyed it but I was a bit taken aback at the adult responses assigned to the elder twins.  I was also a bit befuddled at the Bobbsey adults' dismissive reactions to their children running all over London with children they didn't know confronting criminals -- yes, yes, I know -- this is fiction not to be confused with reality but, in reading these books as an adult, it is surprising to me the \"adultness\" of the children that I didn't catch when reading them as a child.  Hmm..maybe I thought I was just as grown up!  In any event, the Bobbsey family finds themselves going to England with their father who is going on an impromptu business trip.  Before leaving, however, the elder twins find themselves embroiled in a petty theft at a local collectible shop and the mystery follows them across the great pond and finally resolves itself in London.  Unrealistic, yes, but it was written very cleverly in that the mystery was entwined with the Bobbsey's visiting the historical sites and the countryside and meeting new friends and it didn't come across as being contrived at all -- well, except for the aforementioned things.  All in all, it was an enjoyable re-read.  It meant more having now been to the UK and visited the places the Bobbsey's visit.  While the storyline is a bit unbelievable, it was still a bit magical for me.  Who knows, I might read it for a third time!Each of these books were good in my opinion.  I would recommend them and intend to continue reading each series myself."},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, March 30, 2013", "text": "Sorry 'Bout ThatEarlier I used my blog for a minor rant that I have since removed.  I was completely aggravated about not being able to find things in retail establishments like we used to be able to find and how the internet, Pinterest and Facebook were ruining us as a  society.  Pinterest makes us long for things and places that, for the most part, are unattainable for just average people.  I believe that Facebook has disintegrated into a venue for politics, religion and arguments mostly about one  or the other.  I don't like to argue -- it makes me nervous.  The internet has given us the gift of instant gratification -- information now, the ability to purchase most of whatever we want now, the ability to communicate instantaneously.  As a result we have lost the sophistication and grace and, to some extent the ability, to pen a note, to go on long shopping trips where we buy nice handkerchiefs and lunch in classy department store restaurants,  to go into a store and actually find what we are looking for -- nice stationery, little girl's under slips, heaven forbid, gloves! Ah, yes, it is time for me to get my foot out of the last century and carry on with the here and now -- to accept that we will never again wear gloves except for winter items and it is highly unlikely that any childish tears will be wiped away with a beautifully embroidered Irish linen hanky.  I need to realize that \"times they are a'changing\" (thanks BD) and move on but lunch in a classy department store restaurant sure sounds nice.Reading UpdateFirst off, I got flowers! I GOT FLOWERS for absolutely no reason! Yellow roses, my favorite because I am, after all, a Texas gal!  Ok, I just had to share.  Back to the books.I have completed two books for my challenges this week.  The first one, a gift from my daughter, is The Cross Country Quilters by Jenifer Chiaverini, the third in the Elm Creek Quilt series.  The second was a 1959 Bobbsey Twin book entitled The Bobbsey Twins at London Tower.I started the Elm Creek series a couple of months ago after receiving the first book as a gift from my daughter and son-in-law.  These books are right up my alley as they deal with current events, contemporary problems, yet they do it with humor, camaraderie and determination. This book, like the prior one, explores the lives of several women, delving into their unique situations, their problems and solutions.  The underlying theme is their connection through their quilting and their association with Elm Creek Manor.  These women, from all different walks of life, have one connection -- quilting -- and that connection is all they need to provide friendship and support through all the ups and downs of their lives.  These books are realistic yet uplifting.  I can't wait to start the next in the series.The second book I completed was The Bobbsey Twins at London Tower.  This was a re-read for the 2013 Pre-1960 Children's Challenge that I am participating in -- sort of.  This is only my second book so I am clearly not clipping along at a good pace.  At any rate, I received this book for Christmas when it first came out and had it read, even then, in a day.  I have always had a fondness for all things England -- it is my motherland, after all -- so this was of huge interest to me even back in 1959.  It involves the Bobbsey clan getting to go on a trip of a lifetime when their father had to represent his company at a convention in the UK.  Of course, there is a mystery involved that began near their home in  Lakeport and followed them all the way across the great pond to the UK where the pursuit of a couple of thieves continued.  Of course, the mystery was solved, the thieves apprehended and the family returned home feeling accomplished and pleased that they were able to help their friend, Mr. Warwick recover some of his property and they were able to acquire some special miniatures for the castle they built for the local children's hospital.  In re-reading these books in adulthood it is sort of comical that these children possess such adult characteristics and are so in control of situations that most children wouldn't be.  They aren't, for the most part, realistic but they are enjoyable for sure and this won't be my last re-read for this challenge.So, with that, I am off to make potato salad for Easter supper and dust my furniture.  A Happy Easter to all!"},

It just takes my breath away every year -- it never becomes mundane or ordinary to me.  The idea that when I look at Christ on that cross I see my sin on that cross and the fact that someone would do that for me is just the  most awesome thing in the world."},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, March 23, 2013", "text": "It's Baaaaaccccck! That Would Be Winter!I have lived here all my life and I KNOW the weather is changeable but really?  We have gone from summer to winter more times in the last six weeks than I can count.  It is just a bit hard on the old joints and the allergies as well.  So, today I am sitting here doing really almost nothing.  I am marginally cold even though I am in jeans and a long sleeved shirt and SHOES! I never wear shoes! However, the stone floors are not being nice to my plantar fasciitis so I am trotting around in my croc flats which make my right foot swell up.  Ain't being a grown up grand?Anyway -- it hasn't been a very eventful week.  My commute to babysitting is miserable because some brilliant city planner has decided to tear up every highway in the area all at the same time.  I went a new way yesterday which wasn't good because I didn't know my way and, in the process, I almost killed a huge, HUGE, red pick up.  The truck flew out of a convenience store driveway between cars and I couldn't  see around the monster truck next to me and never saw the guy.  I didn't hit him but it really shook me up and the seat belt hurt my chest.  If I ever go that way again, I have to remember about that driveway.On my struggle journey to get home in the afternoon, I see some really amazing drivers.  While standing in the queue to get through the major  intersection that is torn up (it takes about an hour to travel two blocks) I have seen a person drive across a median and up the wrong side of the road to get out of line.  I have seen a person make a left hand turn from the far right lane in front of two lanes of oncoming, albeit non-moving, traffic and the best of all -- a woman in front of me decided it would be a good idea to turn on her hazards, do a bit of work, phone calls and then get out, open her hood and close it immediately, open her truck and close it immediately, get in, turn off the hazards and drive off after keeping traffic stopped for almost 20 minutes.  I have always been able to honestly say that I have never, nor do I now, hate anybody or anything but I am coming close with this afternoon foray into traffic hell.I have discovered, on my journeys, that I can no longer listen to music on the radio -- it is too distracting nor can I listen to conservative talk radio -- it is too infuriating (and I am a conservative!).  I can't sit in the car with nothing going on because that is too boring so I went to our neighborhood used book store the other night in search of an audio book to see if I could listen to that and not get distracted or angry.I came across \"Folly Beach\" by Dorothea Benton Frank.It is twelve discs.  I have started the first and have listened to two chapters.  I had never listened to an audio book before so I didn't know what to expect but it is a bit like listening to a radio program and I found it to be quite enjoyable.  I look forward to my commute next week so I can find out more of what is going on with Dorothy Heyward and Cate Cooper.While I was at the used book store I managed to find a copy of The Bobbsey Twins at London Tower.  I used to have this book and even remember when it was purchased.  My mother was Christmas shopping at Toudouze Market and I found it and asked for it.  She said yes but that I had to wait until Christmas for it.  However, as I followed her around the huge store, I read most of it so she just gave it to me when I got home.  I am not sure what happened to that book -- I will probably find it now that I have replaced it -- but I intend to read it for the children's book challenge I have joined and only read one book for.  I am not good at challenges!I also managed to score a very nice hard back copy of The House of Velvet and Glass by Katherine Howe.  I enjoyed a previous novel that I read of hers -- The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane and hope this one is just as good.However, right now I am reading The Cross Country Quilters by Jennifer Chiaverini and completely enjoying it.  I am three fourths the way through it and I know I am going to hate to see it end.  I wonder if there is a challenge for reading a series?  I could probably do reasonably well with that since I am hooked on this series.So, let's see,  that is about all that has happened this week.  The Hubs has killed the computer three times this week and can't seem to get it back into working order this time. I am protecting my little netbook from him -- he is dangerous.  I also signed up for a one week free trial of Hulu.com.  So far, it is looking good -- has a lot of stuff on it but we will see how much we watch it during our free trial.  At only $7.98 a month, though, I think it is a better deal than Netflix streaming.  Just saying.Well, that is all my news.  Think I will get back to my book before the urge to take yet another nap gets the better of me.  I am so ready for summer!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, March 06, 2013", "text": "RamblingsWe are in that awkward time between winter and spring -- you know, that time in Texas where you wake up in winter and go to bed in summer -- going from heating to a/c during the course of the day.  This week has been a good example -- near freezing one day, 88 high another, windy, cloudy -- all changeable in a matter of hours.  I have always lived in Texas and will never live anywhere else but sometimes the weather is just, in a word, annoying.  I was raised in South Texas and lived there the first 40 years of my life and I honestly say I prefer the climate there. It is hot, but not as hot as North Texas, it is tropical with breezes coming off the gulf -- not a dry heat like here.  It is humid for sure and I had lots of allergy issues there but I am not devoid of the allergy issues here and sometimes I just miss being able to sit out on the porch, watch the stars, feel the breeze, I miss the vegetation, I miss seeing the things I grew up with --our houses, my grandmother and great-grandmother's houses, my schools -- maybe I just miss home. Another thing that I miss is NOT having Daylight Saving Time.  I really don't enjoy the time change and I don't find it that appealing having so much daylight in the summer.  It is just jarring to my system and I don't really think it is necessary.  I guess I just don't understand it but it seems to me that there are just 24 hrs. in a day and roughly 12 of them are daylight and I don't care what the clock says, you just can't change it.  From 1945 to 1966 there was no uniform time law in the US with some states adhering to DST and others not.  In 1966, in an effort to reduce confusion, the US passed a law that all states would subscribe to DST.  I remember it well.  I didn't like it.  I still don't.  I don't know what is wrong with just living on God's time and not having to sacrifice an hour of sleep -- I need that hour. Really.Went out this evening to check on the mint and it is growing quite well in the grass -- not so well in one of the flower beds.  The basil that died ever so dead last year is coming in thick as well as is something else that I can't remember what it is.  The pear trees are blooming, the crabapple is too and the verbena has gone          c           r             a               z                 y!!!!!I just hope we can enjoy all of it before the 104 temp hits and decimates it all and the West Nile carrying mosquitoes come and keep us from going outdoors.  Love/hate summer.Ok, I think that is all I have to rant about today.  You don't even want to get me started on the traffic and the insane drivers who see nothing wrong with driving over medians and up the wrong side of the street to avoid sitting in a queue for five minutes. Ok, done."},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, March 02, 2013", "text": "This and ThatWhat a Saturday this has been.  Usually my Saturdays are really lazy days -- REALLY lazy days -- in that I do pretty much nothing.  My weeks are busy what with babysitting the not-so-much-of-a-baby girl and driving back and forth so I always feel like I should just \"rest\" on the weekends and I have decided that I get more tired relaxing! Plus, I have been staying in and staying quiet a lot due to the allergy issues and not wanting to catch anything else, like the flu, and I pretty much feel like a hermit and not at all well.  So, I decided today would be different.I got up a little before 7 a.m. -- I am  usually up at 5:30 a.m. and I ate a bit of breakfast and checked email.  I woke up hungry which is unusual for me but then, I didn't eat dinner yesterday so I guess it would be expected. Then I decided to revisit an activity that I hadn't really done for years --  now, don't let your imagination go wild -- I am talking about couponing!When my kids were little, I tried to have a coupon for everything in my grocery basket (we were young and on a budget -- I had to make my fun wherever I could find it!).  I guess I was one of those crazy coupon ladies before it became trendy.  I even had file bin that I would carry with me.  It was chock full of coupons and sadly, one day, I left it in the basket at the store and I never saved another coupon after that.  I have clipped them from time to time and left them at home or dropped them on the floor or whatever -- my heart just wasn't in it.  However, today I decided to see if I could get back on the bandwagon to some degree.Things have changed a bit since those \"old days\" of couponing.  Now you can download coupons on to your store reward card! Now that is my kind of coupon clipping -- sitting around with a cuppa and ticking off a box on the computer!  I wasn't sure if it was going to work so I had a plan.  At one store I was going to shop for just those items to make sure that the concept worked and it did.  Thenext store it worked as well and as I perused my receipt I realized that I got multiple discounts on some items -- the sale price, the e-coupon savings and, on some things, a senior citizen discount.  I still smart at that \"sr. citizen\" thing but on several items it was like 10% so I guess I can suck it up and be a big girl about it.So, here is what my savings looked like --Tom Thumb   $10.39Kroger  $16.98Target  $11.20That doesn't look too shabby for less than an hour at the computer and sorting coupons.  One thing that I plan to do differently now than I did back in the day is I am only going to use coupons for stuff I really use and be careful not to go off buying stuff just because I have a coupon for it.   Oh, and of course, I  got a fewcoupons with the receipts as well.  One of them is for a free dessert with coffee at the Starbucks in Target.  I can handle that, for sure!The next thing I am going to do is get a Target Red Card.  It is a debit card linked to my bank account, just like my bank card, and it automatically takes 5% off everything you purchase there,  in addition to any coupons.  Sounds like a good deal to me.In the middle of our runaround, Hubs decided he was hungry so we went to Cooper's Barbecue down in the middle of the Stockyards.They have really fantastic barbecue -- the first bite of the brisket was pure heaven.  I had chicken (even though I nibbled at Hubs beef), potato salad and beans.  There was enough left to bring home for dinner and we refilled our bean bowls (the beans are self-serve) and brought  those home as well so dinner is done! I love it when  I go out and end up with two meals for one.  That is one perk to being a bit older -- we can't eat as much and we have learned to ask for to-go boxes and it is certainly profitable.So, what is usually a lazy day turned out to be a get up and go day and I feel so good for it!  Three stores and lunch out! I am almost giddy.What else has been going on -- let's see.  Well, I am currently reading \"Round Robin\" by Jennifer Chiaverini -- the second in the series and I am having a hard time putting it down.  As I said before, small town, quaint quilt shop, characters you can relate to -- all the makings of a good story.And besides, the covers are just so great.Hubs and I have been enjoying our Roku and haven't really missed the half of our cable service that we eliminated a month or so ago.  We really like British mysteries and comedies so we subscribed to Acorn and have already enjoyed a Poirot, a Cadfael, and a Callan.  I have watched several episodes of \"A Fine Romance\" with Judi Dench so I definitely think we are getting our money's worth there --$29.95 a YEAR.  Oh, yeah, I have taken to playing the lottery.  When I win big I will be sure and give you the address of my Swiss chalet (no, too cold) or my beach front house in Hawaii (hmm..too expensive even for a lottery winner) or maybe my NY penthouse!  You can see it has gone to my head, for sure -- wonder what would happen if I actually won something! LOL!  I am probably never going to have to worry about finding out!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, February 24, 2013", "text": "Stop It!Ok, here's the thing.  I love to blog.  I don't do it often enough and I don't do it well enough but I find that blogging serves lots of purposes -- it provides me an outlet to write, which I love to do; it provides me an outlet to vent which is sometimes necessary; it provides me an outlet to share and to get to know other people.  I run  a clean blog.  I am NOT a person who enjoys or participates in the seedy side of life.  I am religious, I am patriotic, I adore my family,  I am an advocate for those who need one and I do it all in a wholesome way that I am not ashamed for anybody to look at or read -- that is why my blog is public.  However, it seems that, for some reason completely unfathomable to me, my blog is being visited by porn sites as is registered in my \"stats\".  I understand that is just an undesired risk when you have a public blog but, really?  What in the world could be attracting this sort of reader?  I have noticed that this has happened occasionally but it seems in the last week or so it has increased a lot and I am not appreciative of it.  I am concerned about it, I am not sure why since the readers don't comment or make their presence known in any way, but it bothers me and if it continues I will be forced to make my blog private which I really don't want to do -- but I will if I have to.  I read lots of blogs, I find them very informative and enjoyable, and I try not to just \"lurk\" but rather leave a comment that I was there.  I don't always but I try to.  It bothers me that my blog is attracting this sort of people and, unless I look at the stats on the dashboard, I don't know it -- it feels like a violation of sorts.So, to my unwelcome friends --- please go away or make yourself known.  There is nothing here that should be of any interest to you and I am not comfortable with the idea that you are here.  Thank you.  Have a nice day."},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, February 23, 2013", "text": "Intuitive Cooking -- Who Knew?A while back my daughter, faced with meal planning for the week, make the statement  that she wished she could just cook -- no recipes, no cookbook, just go to the store, buy what appeals to her and make a meal.  Sounds reasonable to me.  She and I have pretty much the same attitude toward cooking -- a necessary evil and the more  involved it becomes the more evil it becomes. I have two shelves in my library devoted to all manner of cookbook and I never open them.  The only one I have studied at length is Mark Bittman's  How to Cook Everything.So, I was sitting here today watching Martha Stewart make vegetable stock and I started thinking about what my daughter had said.  That led me to think about my mother who was a fantastic cook and we didn't have a cookbook in  the house.  She would go to the grocery store -- ONE grocery store -- not a day's worth of gadding about with grocery ads in her hand, no gourmet shops, no farmers markets. She went once every two weeks and picked up milk at the convenience store in between.   Her idea of meal planning for a week was seven meats, seven starches, two veggies per night and an occasional dessert.  Then there were the staples -- bread, milk, butter, blah blah blah -- you get the picture.  Same thing each week regular as clock work but she worked magic with those basic ingredients.  At the beginning of the week, usually a Sunday we had a big meal -- roast, potatoes, carrots, etc and leftovers the next day.  As the week would wind down to Saturday we would have what she called our \"poor\" meal -- usually beans and cornbread or soup or stew and she always had a cake or pie.  Didn't sound too poor to me!  And.....she never used a recipe or a cookbook.  There wasn't one in the house.  She said she remembered how they made some things  in Home Ec in junior high school which was great for Floating Island but she just seemed to have an intuitive knack for cooking, seasoning, and getting everything on the table at the same time -- all done.So, when I started searching the internet for \"intuitive cooking\" it dawned on me that that was what my mother did before it became a \"style\" or \"technique\".  Then I realized why my daughter gets slightly exasperated with me when she asks me how I cook something -- I simply can't tell her.  She wants numbers, people, in  cups and teaspoons.  I don't cook like that.  I have told her that she needs to decide to cook something, look up how to do it and then, just do it.  The simpler the better.  Learn to make a great salad, roast a chicken, a pork loin -- all simple and good. I no longer cook large roasts because it is just too much for us and Hubs really doesn't care for leftovers -- something I just can't change his mind on.  So, instead, I braise really lean stew meat with onions and garlic, let it cook for a while and voila! beef we can cut with a fork.  My daughter even likes it and she was the only child vegetarian I knew in the 80's.  So, as I read several blogs on the subject of intuitive cooking -- the rules for intuitive cooking and even recipes for intuitive cooking (????), I realized I had a few of my own so here goes:Buy the best you can afford to buy keeping all the food groups in mind.  Realize that  shopping at the overpriced, gourmet store doesn't necessarily mean better.If fresh isn't so fresh, buy frozen.  It works.Start simple -- learn to roast a whole chicken really well.  It isn't hard and you have lots of meat left over for all sorts of chicken-y things -- like chicken salad.When you have that done, move on to beef.  Salt and pepper is the best seasoning for beef. Remember to keep your plate balanced with protein, starch and veggies -- be colorful.  Protein doesn't necessarily mean meat.Make a simple vinegar dressing and  experiment with herbs and seasoning.Learn to love olive oil.Frying isn't your friend but steaming and sauteing is.Onions, celery, parsley, garlic are basics -- like white underwear.  ALWAYS have it on hand.  Always. You can buy frozen chopped onions or you can do your own -- they freeze very well.Keeping your junior high school home ec class in mind (oh,  they don't have that anymore, do they?) Well, anyway remember balance and portion control.Have fun -- cook what appeals to you -- what you like.  You are doing the cooking for you --- do what you want.None of these rules apply to baking.  However, I don't bake so who cares.My daughter has perfected a few dishes and is more and more willing to try new things even though she still wants a recipe and that is ok.  At some point, she will discover that she has just gone in and cooked a meal without thinking about it and she will be pleased.My goal --  to stock my freezer with homemade stock.  I love stock. Now I am hungry for chicken soup.  Damn."},

{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, February 16, 2013", "text": "Book Reviews -- 2013 Goodreads Reading ChallengeThe last couple of weeks have been good reading weeks for me.  The books I completed were completely different in nature but they were both quick reads and page turners for different reasons.The first book is \"The Quilter's Apprentice\" by Jennifer Chiaverini.  This book was a gift from my daughter and, let's just say she knows me  well.  While I have heard of Chiaverini through quilting sources, I had not read her books and I have to say that I was definitely missing out.  The book is about two young people, Sarah and Matt McClure, making a new start  in a new place -- a small college town in Pennsylvania.  Matt is a landscape architect and has landed a job at Elm Creek Manor, the family home of aging Sylvia Compson.  Sarah, looking for a change in career and unable to make any acceptable connections, accepted a position as personal assistant to the testy Mrs. Compson -- her job being to help Mrs. C prep the manor for sale.  Without saying too much, let me just assure you that there are relationships formed, relationships mended, realizations, new starts for everyone all around and a very happy ending.  This is a feel good book.  There are conflicts but not horrible conflicts.  There is sadness but not so sad that there is no comfort.  For a quilter, this book is a little bit of heaven.  I mean, what is not to love about a small, picturesque town with a quaint quilt store.  As I read along I caught myself doing the rocking stitch in the air -- I guess once it is part of you, you never really quit.  It really made me want to try to do some hand quilting again, I will just have to go slow so the hands don't hurt so much.  I can hardly wait to start the next book in the series.  Thank you, daughter!The second book I read was \"Wench\" by Dolen Perkins-Valdez.  This is a work of fiction based on a real place -- the Tawawa Resort in Xenia, Ohio. The resort opened in 1852 and closed in 1855 due to declining business resulting from  the displeasure of the  northern white patrons with the southern white patrons and their slave entourages.  The property changed hands and became the Ohio African University in 1856.  Enrollment decreased during the Civil War and the university eventually closed. in 1863 the property was purchased by the African Methodist Episcopal Church and became Wilberforce University which continues to be the nation's oldest African University.  It is believed that many of the first students were the children of the slave women and their white owners.As I said previously, this is a work of fiction detailing the summer vacations of four slave mistresses and their white masters.  The strength of this book, in my opinion, is the characterization.  When this book first caught my eye I shied away from it because of the subject matter.  I couldn't imagine a book about slavery being \"entertaining\" and I certainly wouldn't use that word to describe this book.  As I began, I felt bad reading about these women in their deplorable situations -- some true slaves, some in love with their masters, some whose masters loved them -- but then I realized that these women wanted me to read about them, to \"know\" them, to see that these women were women like any other with the strength, knowledge and abilities to get them through -- just like all women of the ages.  One of the most compelling  themes is the need, desire and endurance of relationships between these women.  I am not talking about romantic relationships but rather the relationships that uphold us all through birth, death, joy, sorrow and loss.  Slaves were viewed as being pretty much inhuman and this book dispells that notion by showing how these women dealt with the \"stuff\" of life, how their strengths, frailties, and faith were no different than any woman -- then or now.I was afraid that the graphic nature of this book would be more than  I could  handle.  I do read for pleasure and I couldn't imagine reading about cruelties toward these women being pleasurable and it wasn't but there was only enough of these scenes to move the story along-- it wasn't overdone for shock value.  It was a compelling book and these women drew me in.  I found myself thinking about how I would react in each of their situations and which one I identified with most.With all of this said, it was a page turner, it was enlightening and it did have a happy ending -- a couple of them actually.I would recommend this to anybody interested in history.  If you are looking for something light and airy -- pass this one by."},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, February 03, 2013", "text": "Super Bowl SundayWell, not for me.  I am not a professional sports fan so I am reading my way through this game although my husband is watching it.  I am yearning for \"Downtown Abbey\" but it will have to wait a bit. \"What am I reading\", you might ask.  I am reading through my blog list which I try to do every day.  I have a very nice variety of blogs that I enjoy reading that cover a variety of subjects.  I get such pleasure and inspiration from these blogs and feel that I have actually made friends with many of the authors.  I start my day out reading a specific few and, as I sit with my cuppa and my computer in the early morning, I feel like I am having a nice visit with a friend.  Reading blogs is such a different experience from social networking (i.e. Facebook) -- much more rewarding and a lot less manic (read \"political\").I am also reading a couple of new books.  One I am enjoying a great deal, the other, not so much.  \"The Quilter's Apprentice\" by Jennifer Chiaverini was a gift to me from my daughter.  She certainly knows me well and knew that I would enjoy getting into this series.  What's not to love?  I mean, quilting, a beautiful old mansion in Pennsylvania, a woman trying to \"find herself\", an older woman looking to/needing to connect -- I love books involving the human condition and this is brimming with that.  Throw in a quaint quilt shop (would love to own one!) and I am in reading heaven.  This book is a page turner and even though I am only about half done, I would definitely recommend.The second book that I am reading --or trying to -- is one that caught my eye months ago but I was hesitant to acquire it so I waited until I found it on the discount shelf at the bookstore before I bought it and I am glad I waited.  It is \"Wench\" by Dolen Perkins-Valdez and, while it has my interest, I am afraid it is going to be a lot more graphic than I like.  I am sure it involves the human condition as it concerns a posh vacation spot where wealthy plantation owners would frequent with their slave mistresses.  I am not sure I am going to get very far into this book as I don't think I will be able to handle the subject matter.  I will see and let you know.  I don't usually give up on books but I do read for pleasure and I am not sure this is going to be pleasurable. I am finishing up some cross stitch Christmas ornaments that I started a while back.  They were supposed to be done for Christmas but I got sick and, well, it just didn't happen.  Oh well, there is always next year!  I especially enjoy doing the ornies from Little House Needleworks because they are challenging enough but quick enough to almost qualify as instant gratification -- providing you don't get sick!  These are the ones I am currently working on. I had planned a flat finish for these but I really enjoy a pillow-type finish with ribbons and things so I think that is what I will do -- maybe with a velvet backing.  I have a lot of time to figure it out!It has been a quiet weekend.  My knee and foot are killing me so I haven't been up and around very much.  I already have arthritis (first diagnosed at 34 years old! A couple of years ago) and then I twisted it badly trying to get up off the floor while babysitting.  I am ok once I am down but if I have to do much getting up and down, I am done.  So, between that and the plantar faciitis in my right heel, I am fairly useless.  In spite of that, and the headache I can't get rid of, I did do laundry today and rearrange my kitchen counters and swap some flour/sugar into new canisters. I wasn't entirely idle but I did do a bit of resting as I went.  All of this knee/foot pain is really tiring and I missed church today because I just wasn't moving around very well and, honestly, exhausted.  It took me all day to get any energy and it didn't last long.  I sound like an ancient, old crone but I am not -- however, I think my knees are at least twenty five years older than the rest of me.  Ouch.On that note, I am back to my book.  I will review it later on."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, January 28, 2013", "text": "2013 Reading ChallengeI just finished the second book for my 2013 Reading Challenge hosted by Good Reads.  The book is \"Birmingham Rose\" by Annie Murray, a British author new to me.  First off, let me say that this book would make a wonderful movie!This novel, for me, was a page turner.  It began in 1931 in Birmingham, England and revolves around the Lucas family.  They were a poor family living in a poor area and sharing all the problems of a family in those conditions.  The main character is Rose -- the eldest daughter  of the Lucas family who dreams of \"getting out\" and strives to do just that.  In the process she endures a personal attack, an unwanted pregnancy that  ends tragically, the loss of her mother, the remains of her family pretty much falling apart.  After the start of World War II, she joins the British military and ends up in Italy where she falls in love with a person that was destined to be linked to something else -- the Catholic Church.  After the war, Rose returns to Birmingham, has a less than wonderful marriage, a child and a dream.Yes, the dream comes true in the end but I have given you enough information.  I am not sure if the book is available in the US as I borrowed it from a British friend.  It is a definite recommend, however."},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, January 21, 2013", "text": "Musing Mondays  21 January 2013Musing Mondays is a weekly event hosted by Should Be Reading.  Each week you are asked to answer one of three questions.  This week I will be writing about what I am reading and my opinions of it.  It will be a long post as I am currently reading three things at once -- a virtually unheard of thing for me.  So, here goes.Annie Murray is a British author that is new to me.  My daughter's mother in law brought this book with her during a recent visit and left it behind for me to enjoy.  As is a usual occurrence when I try to read more than one book at a time, one takes over and the others sit around waiting for me.  Well, this is the one that has grabbed my attention at the moment.  It is a story about Rose, a little girl growing up in an unsavory area of Birmingham, England.  It depicts her living conditions in a very graphic manner, sometimes a little too graphic for me.  Her story progresses as she gets her first job which she is thrilled about so that she can help her family, her attack by her boss and the subsequent tragedy resulting from that and, her new life in the British army during World War II.  That is where I am now, about half way through the book and,  at this point, it seems that her tragic life is somewhat behind her and things are looking up a bit despite it being in the middle of the war with the very soul being bombed out of Britain.  I have left off where she has left boot camp and is being transferred to another base.  I am pretty sure her misery is not behind her but maybe it won't be as bad as what she left behind.  I will let you know.The next book I am reading is the first Bobbsey Twins book by Laura Lee Hope.  I downloaded it to my Nook -- I would love to have the lovely first edition pictured above and I even  went to my local antique mall to look for it -- they have a huge children's section -- but couldn't find it.  I am reading this in participation of the children's book challenge I have joined -- each book has to be at least 60 pages and this one is 65 and for the life of me I can't get through it.  Shouldn't 65 pages only take about an hour or so?  Not in my world, I guess.  Anyway, I am enjoying the book and honestly, except for a bit of word usage, you wouldn't readily realize that his book was written in 1902, the year of my grandmother's birth -- it seems much more contemporary than that which contributes to the enjoyment of reading it.  I have to say that the dialogue of Dinah, the family cook, is  stereotypical and definitely NOT politically correct and is, actually, a bit difficult to understand. I don't find it particularly offensive, just typical of the time and when I read it I see Hattie McDaniel who was always one of my favorite actresses.  I am enjoying the book as it takes me through the daily life of the Bobbsey family.  Being interested in family history and knowing when the book was written, I like to think about my grandmother as I am reading it and learning about life during what was her childhood.  By the way, this isn't my first Bobbsey Twin book as these books were a staple on my bookshelf -- my mother bought many of them and I inherited a few from JLSHall (did you know that?).  The ones in my personal library tell a bit about MY childhood as well as JLSHall and I would play \"library\" and we make checkout card packets and stapled them into the books and they are still there.  Really?  How many kids today play library?  Well, we did only have three tv channels at the time.The third book I am reading is \"And Furthermore\" by Judi Dench about Judi Dench.  I am a huge fan of this actress and I have loved reading about her career and her life.  However, most of all, I like looking at the photos and there are many.  This is one of those books I can pick up and read a bit and put it down -- not like  a novel where you have to keep going -- it is much more relaxed.  I have been interested in reading some biographies lately and this is my first.  My next will be about Coco Chanel.  You would think with my interest in these very stylish ladies I would have more style! Hmmm.  I need to think about that.Anyway, that is what is on my reading table and Nook this week.  Hopefully by next week the list will have changed.  I am a slow reader but this is ridiculous."},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, January 19, 2013", "text": "What Do I Do Of A Morning?Do you ever wonder about other's days?  How they begin, I mean.  I am certain we all do  pretty much the same thing -- go to work, take care of kids, grocery shop, yard work, etc., but the morning time holds a special sort of personal private time.My mornings used to begin with a lot of activity -- out of bed, grab a cuppa, haul kids to school, haul laundry to the washer, haul groceries into the house -- my younger years involved a good deal of hauling, it seems.  Now, not so much.I begin my days very early these days.  I am generally out of bed by 5:30 a.m. even though I could squeeze in an extra fifteen minutes of snoozing and still get to my appointed destination on time.  However, I have learned that it isn't a good idea to drive while still dozy.  It is much better to give myself the extra time to completely wake up.  How do I do this? I dress immediately out of bed.  I have very short hair so a quick run of the fingers through it generally does the trick.  I often forego the makeup -- just a bit of moisturizer if I feel much like a mummy emerging from the crypt.  Into the kitchen I go -- the kettle is on, the computer is booting up and I am settling on whatever I am going to eat.  Most times it is cereal but lately I have been having a love affair with frozen waffles.  Yep, the kind in the yellow box, probably chock full of no-no's but at 5:30 a.m. they seem very much like a yes-yes to me.Then I sit and delve into my guilty pleasure -- blog reading.  I love, absolutely love, reading blogs.  However, it does produce a good amount of blog envy because I don't have particularly clever posts, I don't live in a particularly photogenic place, I don't have over the top adorable pets -- you see where I am going here.  My posts pale in comparison to the ones I read.  I tried very hard to participate in Jane's  weekly post of photos of our changing gardens but after the first several months I realized that mine doesn't change.  Ever.  I used to  have lovely little bunnies that visited every evening and then they tore down the vacant lot behind me and built a condo so no more little bunnies.  Now, all there is to see in my garden is the same ol', same ol' and, if you venture into the side yard -- a good deal of dead grass.  I guess I should say dormant  grass -- hopefully it is just sleeping and not dead.So, I sit for about a half hour in the morning and just indulge in blog reading.  I read the blog lists of MY blog list.  There are some very clever writers out there and some very talented photographers, as well. The book reviews I read are always enlightening.   I get inspiration for needle crafts and quilts from these blogs.  This morning I was teased with the idea of making holiday greeting cards for next year. However, now it is time for me to get busy on some projects of my own.  Photos to follow,  hopefully.  Maybe one day my little blog will grow up to be an interesting blog as well. I think, in order for that to happen, it is going to have to become independent of ME!Have a wonderful Saturday!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, January 13, 2013", "text": "Hair -- AgainAh, yes, the ever present quest for the perfect haircut.  I have had short hair since I was 15 years old.  I won't go into  how long that has been -- it isn't important.  However, when I initially cut my hair at 15, I cut it from shoulder length, lank, unhealthy,  abused, teenage hair.  I loved the short hair and only grew it out once, when I was expecting my son.  Those prenatal vitamins are powerful things!  For the majority of the time since the 15 year old haircut, I have cut my own hair.  Sometimes it was good, sometimes not so much -- not a lot different than salon cuts.  However, I got tired of having to clean up the mess in the bathroom and decided to find a salon and have been going ever since.  That was about 10 years ago.  I have been through a lot of styles in that 10 years and have sort of settled on a pixie. HOWEVER.....It looks great for the first week.  By the second week it is getting a bit raggedy.  By week three it is out of control and by week four it doesn't even resemble the original cut.  I really need it cut again after week 2.  At $50 a pop that really seems like an overkill.So, I am sitting here listening to the media reports on the flu and wondering if I could go back and cut my hair myself again.  Since we are in the middle of a flu epidemic I am not crazy about going to the beauty shop as I have to go on a Saturday and it is usually very crowded. I am also trying to figure out if I could cut it myself so it doesn't grow out so wonky.  As I am running my fingers through my hair I am realizing that one side is really longer than the other.  Maybe I should grow it out long and pin it up?How about that news story this morning about the woman who gave up makeup for a year.  She went to a barbershop for a haircut. I don't know but the idea of $100 a month to get my haircut like a guy isn't making me feel too  good or too smart.  Must be another way.Thoughts?"},

{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, January 05, 2013", "text": "Who Do You Think You Are?Does anybody remember that show of a couple of seasons ago?  It was a product of Ancestry, the genealogy website and featured celebrities researching their family history.  I really enjoyed the show because I have done genealogy for years and years and visit the Ancestry website on a regular basis.I was intrigued a while back when I learned of the Ancestry DNA program.  I was quite interested in learning more about my father's side of the family -- there are some mysteries there -- but I was not able to participate in any of the DNA programs available since I was not male.  In fact, there was only one male left in the family that could be tested and he didn't seem to be interested.  Unfortunately, before I could press him, he died unexpectedly a year ago.  So, when the Ancestry program came about I was excited because it is an autosomal test which would show both sides of a females DNA -- it just can't tell you what ethnicity comes from which side.  I ordered the test, provided the sample and sent it off. About three weeks later I got the results.  I was simultaneously overwhelmed and underwhelmed.  I was overwhelmed because I thought it was so cool to have actually participated in such a program.  I was underwhelmed, not because of what it showed me, but by what it didn't show me.  I know I have some American Indian ancestry and it didn't show up at all, even in the \"uncertain\" category.  I was most interested in finding out if my father's father was actually from Irish Jewish heritage, which we suspect, yet, nothing \"Jewish\" showed up at all.  I understand the test is shallow but wide which may show a lot of heritage but maybe not so far back so possibly what I am looking for was too far back for it to show up.  They say the results can change as more people participate -- I am not sure how that would affect my personal DNA, I guess I need to do more research as to what the results mean and how they are compiled. At any rate it was an interesting thing to do but I have to say that I am a bit put off by the fact that I paid $129 to take the test and they are having a New Year's special and the test is now $99 for a limited time.  Figures.So, here are the sought after results -- no surprises.  Maybe that is a good thing.British Isles -- 86%Central European -- 6%Scandinavian  -- 8%I tried to post the actual page -- it is pretty -- but it wouldn't work so you are just going to have to take my word for it!"},

From January to March I wish I lived someplace besides Texas.  Any place but Texas.  The mountain cedar is an evil weed which is not useful for anything and we should try to do something about it but nobody even tries.  I am so \"lucky\" that the builders of the condo behind us paid so close attention to our request that they not plant cedar as we are all quite allergic to it -- they only planted about 150 of the wretched things around the property and lined my back fence with them.  That alone would make me leave my beloved house and search for something a little more cedar free.I really have nothing for an interesting post.  I look forward to my day with the Bean but I know she isn't going to be happy.  I am glad it is a short week.  She is such a clever little thing.  The other day DD told her that she \"loved her to pieces\" and Bean looked at her, frowned and said \"don't take me apart -- I not a puzzle\".  She has a vivid imagination and has started relating her dreams.  They are pretty elaborate but not scary.  She plays so well and has such a long attention span that taking care of her just requires tending to her needs.  She spends a lot of time \"reading\" her books -- another reading addict in the making.

However, between this, the classic children's challenge and babysitting,  I think that is all that I can handle.I have to say that my decision to join was made  this morning when I was reading JLSHall's blog, A Little Reading.  It seems that she has signed up for twelve -- 12 -- 1-2 -- challenges.  Needless to say I felt quite the underachiever so I decided to forge ahead and sign up for one more.For those who don't know, JLSHall and I are cousins.  I like to refer to us as sistercousins because were raised more as sisters than cousins and  our  relationship dynamic has always been more sisterly than cousinly.  She is a couple of years older which means she got to experience \"life\" first.  I found myself following in her footsteps.  Whatever she did, I had to do and my mother used her as sort of a parameter of what I could/could not do.  I was sort of like a puppy following her around and I am sure that became very annoying.  Over the years, however, our differences emerged and we became our own women -- each having strengths and weaknesses that  the other doesn't have.  However, we are more alike than different and I still look to her as a role model and I still follow in her footsteps although not quite so \"in her face\" as I used to.  That would explain my foray into the book challenges for this year.  Not as committed as she is but, as it has been all my life, if Joy is doing it then it must be a  good thing and I shall do it as well.So, that coupled with  my opinion that one of the best things that a person can do in life is learn to read and do it was gusto, I will persevere.  I believe that reading is the most basic, most important skill a person can learn because if you can read, you have the world in your hands.  I thank JLSHall for all those reading lessons while playing \"school\" and for introducing me to the books that I hold dear now (Star Girl will be one of my choices) and, for that matter, writing such compelling reviews now that I go to when looking for new reading material. With that, off I go, to Lakeport to join the Bobbsey Twins and back to Old Vic with my new BFF Judi!The Bobbsey TwinsI have decided on my first book for the classic children's books challenge that I signed up for after saying I wouldn't.  I have decided to read the first book in The Bobbsey Twin series which was originally published in 1904.  I won't go through the whole series because there are 72 books and a number of them were originally published after the required date cut-off of 1960.  However, the last Bobbsey Twin book that I ever bought was The Bobbsey Twins Go To London Tower and it was published in 1959 so I will probably re-read it.  I remember when it was purchased.  My mother was Christmas shopping -- for me, I might add-- at Toudouze Market in San Antonio and I found the book and wanted it.  She asked if I wanted it for Christmas or right then  and I remember looking at her as if she were speaking in a foreign tongue -- I wanted it right then and I wanted to read it right then, in the store.  In fact, I had the thing half read before we ever got home from that shopping excursion.  I was a voracious reader at age 9.  I remember enjoying all the Bobbsey Twin books that I read and, so far, I am enjoying this one.I will return with a review after I am done.  I doubt many of my bloggy friends will be too interested in my reading children's  books but I am such a sucker for them that I really couldn't pass up the challenge.  I read many children's books, on a daily basis, to Bean -- Granddaughter the Second.  None of them fill the challenge requirement because they are too short (must be at least 60 pages) but I do have my favorites and maybe I will start doing reviews on those! At any rate, this is my first choice.  I have loaded it on my Nook and have already begun to read. If I really like it, I will probably head to my local antique mall and try to find a copy -- they have a huge children's book section so it isn't out of the realm of possibility.   What a contrast -- Judi Dench and The Bobbsey Twins!  Nobody can accuse me of not being diverse.More later as I progress with this challenge."},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, January 01, 2013", "text": "What a Way to Start a New YearYep, I lied.  I said no more reading challenges yet, as I was reading JLSHall's blog, I learned of the Pre-1960 Classic Children's Books Reading Challenge and I was, well, challenged.  I love children's books, especially the children's books of my childhood.  I have quite a few to choose from and I have no idea where I will start -- more on that later.So, if anybody would like to join Joy and me as we embark on this challenge, you can find the rules here.  So now I have to decide -- Bobbsey Twins?  Nancy Drew?  Honey Bunch?  Blue Willow or Strawberry Girl?  So many choices and a bit disturbing that I have so many in my personal library! I guess I am a child at heart so I should enjoy this challenge.Join me?Happy New Year!I didn't stay up last night to ring in the new year.  I tried to go to bed early but I got involved in watching the latest episode of \"Sister Wives\" which I had DVR'd.  I am not sure why I watch that program from time to time but right now I am interested in the houses they are building and completely in awe of how the husband affords to keep four families -- and drive really nice cars! At any rate, I hit the sack about 11:30, fell asleep, and woke up about fifteen minutes later itching.  I have a dry skin issue in the summer and the winter and it really drives me crazy sometimes.  I know, TMI, but while awake, I heard one, lonely little firecracker.  I didn't look outside to see if I could see more.  I just went back to bed hoping I could get back to sleep.  I did and the rest of the night was uneventful. I hope the first day of the new year is going to be nice as the last several have not been.  Over the last two weeks we have seen unseasonably warm temps, cold temps, rain, sleet, snow, wind, hail and very little sun.  I realize this is Texas and we are well known for our variable weather but this is sort of ridiculous.  We have needed the rain badly so it was welcomed especially with everybody off work but now we need a little normalcy.  The thing that was so good about yesterday, however, was that with the rain, the cedar pollen was grounded and almost not on the chart at all!!! What a nice reprieve.  However, it is back up into the med-high range and I have to go grocery shopping.  Bummer.The book that I am starting out the year with is one I got as a Christmas gift from Hubs.I have always, always been a big fan of Judi Dench and have enjoyed seeing her on tv and in movies and have always found her to be such a class act.  If you want to analyze her, it isn't hard to see that she doesn't fit the mold of a typical American actress or celebrity ( I don't think we have many great actresses here anymore -- Meryl Streep is our greatest right now, I think).  She isn't tall, she isn't exotic and she isn't outrageous  I recently watched a you tube video of Dench on a comedy show being \"interviewed\" by the comedic host -- I am not familiar with who it was as he was British and it was in the 60's and we didn't have much access to British media back then.  She was very Mia Farrow-ish at the time -- small, blond with her signature pixie hair cut and dressed very well -- gorgeous and modest dress.  It was clear she was a stage actress rather than a film actress and she was very on top of her  game.  Her confidence, her comedic timing and her appearance was just so refreshing.  She exudes a sense of confidence and, at the same time, a vulnerability that makes her seem to real to me -- and probably approachable.  I like her enough to have copied her hairstyle!  I am about a quarter of the way through the book and I am totally enjoying the stories she is relating about her time at Old Vic and all the antics of her peers.  It takes me back to a time that is very dear to my heart -- my childhood and teenagehood and it is so interesting to see that time from another point of view much different than my own. My New Years Day is going to be spent getting back in the groove.  It has been a very relaxing Christmas vacation, despite being sick.  I need to catch up on laundry, grocery shop, finally cook dinner again and try to get back to my usual routine.  The one thing we are going to have to do today is try to deal with our new issue -- ants.  We have ants all over the house and we don't know why.  I guess I will spend some time today trying to figure out a natural solution to the problem -- I have been bitten so many times now and I am a little tired of it.  So, New Year, new challenge -- who knew it would be such an annoying one!So, with that said, I am off to get back to normal.  Have a wonderful day!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, December 31, 2012", "text": "Well, Hello 2013, Glad to Meet You!Happy New Year to all who might happen by here.  I no longer stay up until midnight to see the new year in so I am doing my well-wishing now.  I hope 2013 brings all of you good health and much happiness -- if you have those two things you have everything!I am not sure why the idea of a new year is so intriguing -- seriously, I don't expect tomorrow to be vastly different than today but the new year is like a new beginning, a chance to start over, to right wrongs, to ....buy new towels at the January white sales!I don't do resolutions anymore.  I never keep them and they usually involve sweets and soda and weight loss and, by now, we know that isn't going to happen.  I am usually breaking the resolution as I write it down!  This year I am just thinking in terms of doing things better, being more focused in the things I do, trying to make my little part of the world a better place.  I am also thinking a good deal about how I spend my time.  Over the last several months I have been thinking about being more discerning about doing things I really want to do and not what the world thinks I should do.  These thoughts have also lead me to think about who I am and how I am and how I am fortunate to have gotten to the point that I can pretty much be comfortable with who I am and not feel like I have to meet some sort of society driven expectation of what I should be.  Isn't it a shame that we have to wait until we are old to be happy in our own skin.  I guess that falls under the heading \"20-20 Hindsight\".  Ah, well, I look forward to the next year being one of contentment. I have spent a good deal of time in 2012 researching minimalist living and frugal living.  This all began with our rather abrupt retirement a year and a half ago.  I wasn't prepared emotionally for the changes in our life and, as things like this usually do, I was sent into a tail spin.  We made quite a few changes to our life style -- some good that we retained and some not so good that we discarded.One of these best things we did this year was change our cell phone plan.  We are not \"smart phone\" people -- I even went back to a basic flip phone -- so when our children decided to go out on their own we decided to give up our \"family plan\" and opt for pay as your go plans.  Hubs has 1000 minutes that he can keep for up to a year -- whatever is left over can be rolled over as long as he adds to the plan before the 1000 minutes is used.  He isn't a phone user so it will take him a long time to use that 1000 minutes.  His plan is $100 which isn't bad considering his minutes will last him quite a while.  My plan is $30 a month for 1500 minutes and a small amount of data.  It is more than I need and I have it set up to be renewed each month by credit card.  The minutes don't roll over on this plan, however.  All in all, though, we have saved over $100 a month on our cell phone bill which I thought was pretty good.  My next goal is to dissect the cable bill -- I see a Roku in our future.I still line dry some of our laundry and I still prefer to make my own laundry soap.  I cut my hair into a minimal care \"pixie\" because of the health of my hair and, as a result, I find I am saving money on product and time spent on messing with my hair.  My hair is looking much better as well even if a \"pixie\" isn't the most flattering style on me.  Neither is bald so I needed to pick one -- I think I made the right choice. I have turned off the tv more which has resulted in less electricity spent, less aggravation over the news and more peace -- I have learned to love, even crave, a home that isn't polluted by sound.  Of course, turning off the tv has aided my ability to read much, much more.  I have also learned to enjoy some programming on my computer on sites like Hulu.  That enables me to really choose what I want to watch, not sit zombie-like at a lineup that somebody  else has decided for me.  My, I am becoming a cantankerous old broad, aren't I?All in all 2013 was a good year.  No major illnesses, minimal family drama, a good deal of time spent just watching the miracle of a child grow (there is nothing like it), waking up realizing that I had survived the retirement and relishing in the fact that we, in fact,  woke up, we are healthy and we are thankful to God for all the blessings, big and small,  that he has bestowed on us. My plans for 2013 include much the same with more time spent watching, enjoying, \"smelling the roses\" so to speak, praying, loving and being grateful.Happy New Year All!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, December 27, 2012", "text": "Booking Through Thursday -- December 27, 2012What are/were your favorite book(s) of the year?  Bonus points if you know how many books you read.Well, since I participated in the 2012 Reading Challenge, I know how many books I read.  My goal was 25 books and I completed 22 and am still working on 23.  I may or may not get it finished by the end of the year.  I did  better this year than last year but I don't think I will be participating in any more challenges.  I feel like the goal to finish a certain number of books sort of lessens the enjoyment of reading so my goal for the new year will be to read books I really enjoy, take the time to really enjoy them and write some nice reviews.As far as my favorite books of the year are concerned, I have to say I enjoyed all the books I read.  I really enjoyed getting into the \"Aunt Dimity\" series and plan to continue with the series this year.  There are fifteen in the series and I am about half done, taking breaks between books to read other things.I have to say that \"The School of Essential Ingredients\" was a favorite contemporary work.  The setting drew me in immediately -- I  love being able to visualize where/when a book is set.  If the setting is well developed, I am caught.I think my favorite \"period\" novel was \"The Forgotten Garden\".   For me it was a page turner that I couldn't put down.  I read it on my Nook and then bought a hard copy for my library.  I had never read any of Kate Morton works but several other titles of hers are on my list for 2013. I enjoyed \"The Little Stranger\" by Sarah Waters but it wasn't as scary as I was hoping.  It was more sad than scary and when I read it I was in the mood for scary but it was still really good -- I am a big fan of Sarah Waters and hope to read more of her works in the new year.So, yeah, that's about it!Random  Thoughts --- AKA Another Boring, Photo-less, PostSince I am completely engulfed in a severe case of Cedar Fever, I am doing a lot of sitting which is getting really, really boring.  My cabin fever is centered around my chair in front of the tv -- awful.  Anyway, I am sitting here, not feeling like doing  much, but I am thinking about the year to come.  I am not a good one with resolutions.  I don't like making them because I generally forget about them immediately and they aren't very inspiring anyway.  It isn't like I resolve myself to do some good, charitable work or somehow change mankind.  I usually resolve to lose half my body weight -- right after the current cookie! So, I don't do resolutions. However,  I am thinking about how to do things better this year.  Not big things, just little things and how to make time for the things I love to do but generally let go because of the things I HAVE to do.  Another thing on my list is how to lighten up my stress level.  I don't have a lot of stress.  We are retired and are reasonably secure in that status.  I don't have a lot of pressing things to worry about but I tend to worry a lot about things that I can do nothing about.  I need to work on that.  Maybe some exercise would help with that.  I have to think about it.The one thing to change that sticks in my mind is joining reading challenges.  I find them stressful.  Last year I joined a couple and found myself rushing to read a certain number of books -- I didn't enjoy the books, it was just an exercise to see if I could meet my goal and see how fast I could read. This year was a bit better even though I didn't make my goal.  I didn't worry about that so much so I enjoyed my reading experience more which tells me that maybe reading challenges aren't my \"thing\".Another thing I am going to try to get involved in again is genealogy with the goal of adding more ancestors to my DAR roll.  I have run across a lady in Del Rio -- a cousin -- who has just had one of our relatives approved for the first time and I am looking forward to working with her to add him to my list of ancestors who fought in the American Revolution. As far as crafts, sewing, etc. go, I haven't had much time for that plus my hands seem to be giving me arthritis problems so quilting and such isn't much fun.  However, I have three quilts promised that I need to work on and a mound of cross stitch patterns to do.  I don't know that I am going to do the cross stitch with any particular project in mind -- just for the joy in doing it.  I do have a couple of bird charts that I would like to do so that I can frame them -- I have a nice place to put them and think they would look good in my house so that will probably be a goal. So, like I said, this post is just a bunch of random thoughts.  I am just trying to figure out how to be happy, to do what I enjoy and let go of what I don't without guilt!Yeah."},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, December 25, 2012", "text": "Merry Christmas All!Yes, it is Christmas Day, 2012 and a mighty odd one, I might add.  I am glad I have gotten old enough to just accept that things aren't always going to turn out the way you planned and to just get on with it --  the whole lemons/lemonade thing.I didn't feel good all last week and, actually several days prior to that but I was busy and didn't pay much attention.  Bad move.  I have lived in Texas (aka Mountain Cedar Hell Hole) all my life and all my life I have been a mess from December to March.  Whatever made me think this year would be different?  I usually start looking at pollen charts around Thanksgiving so I can get a heads up on the progress of the little yellow blooming buggers but I failed to do  that this year until day before yesterday when I was hit like  a ton of brick with raging allergy symptoms.  The mountain cedar count was at the very top of the published chart and there I was outside actually breathing! I started with a cough, day before yesterday, and then yesterday I was a complete disaster but went ahead and attended church and went to my daughters for Christmas Eve dinner which was lovely -- our traditional Tex-Mex fare.  However, I was miserable and couldn't wait to get home to swallow some Benadryl and Mucinex and go to bed. We were supposed to get up early this morning and head to daughter's house to watch Bean open her gifts.  However, that didn't happen.  We were awakened in the night by a thunderstorm complete with severe lightening and hail.  Dear daughter phoned me at 5:45 and said not to come, it was pretty treacherous out there which was fine because it took me three hours to get the allergy symptoms under control.  In that three hours we went from thunderstorms to sleet to snow.  It snowed all afternoon and has finally stopped but the temperature is below freezing so it is now an ice rink outside.  I am just thankful that nobody has to go to work tomorrow.  They were reporting that the sanding trucks and snow plows were ready to go but the first thing that happened was one of the sand trucks turned over.  Let it suffice to say that Texans don't do ice and/or snow well.  At all.We missed out on Christmas dinner with Dear Daughter tonight.  She  and her British hubby had a traditional British dinner complete with Yorkshire pudding, thanks to her mother-in-law who is visiting.  They enjoyed the traditional crackers and, the last I heard, the new stuffed Mickey Mouse doll was wearing a paper hat out of the cracker!We had a lovely dinner ourselves, though.  We had grilled steak, baked potatoes and sauteed spinach and mushrooms.  We didn't have any dessert because Hubs did a lot of damage to the Welsh cakes that I made and his blood sugar was just a bit elevated -- a big bit.  So, now we are watching \"The Bourne Legacy\", the new Bourne movie which he received as a gift in his little gift bag. I don't like being sick and I really don't like having my plans changed but all in all we had a nice holiday.  I guess the snow was a nice touch and, since I don't feel well, I won't be getting out anyway but a little sunshine would have been nice.  Oh well, they say that will be tomorrow so I plan on a nice sleep and hopefully waking to a less allergy-ridden me.I hope all of you had a wonderful holiday and look forward to a happy New Year."},

I don't usually start books that I don't think I can/will finish but that did happen to me with \"London\" by Edward Rutherford.  It is an outstanding book full of genealogy which is right up my alley but it is long and I got distracted.  I have full intention of finishing it and continue to read it from time to time -- it is sort of a work in progress so to speak.  It is slow going but I will finish it."},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, December 09, 2012", "text": "The Calm Before the StormIt has been unseasonably warm here in Cowtown, Funkytown, Fot Wuth, whatever you want to call this little burg.  We have been enjoying shorts and t-shirt weather for weeks but later today, according to the meteorology  gods, all of that is going to change.  We are going to have a strong Canadian cold front that promises much colder temperatures and flirts with the promise of a few fluttery flakes.  Sounds lovely, doesn't it?  Well, not so much.  I don't know about anywhere else in the world, but  our news reporting here in North Texas has become quite the media circus with much hype over nothing.  They start reporting these sorts of events several days in advance with the urgency escalating proportionately as the event draws near.  By now we should all be going out and emptying the stores of all manner of foodstuffs and duct tape (duct tape?    whatever for?).  For years, we all did just that and, of course, nothing happened.  After a while nobody paid any attention anymore  -- well, except maybe for the purchase of the occasional extra package of toilet tissue and carton of milk.  I was one of those.  I poo-pooed  all news reports and was pretty much correct most of the time.However, three years ago I learned my lesson.  It was reported that we would have a few flurries -- I did my regular grocery shopping and figured we would just take some nice photos if anything actually happened.  Well, happened it did and and what a mess.  My daughter was pregnant and teaching school down the road -- they didn't close the school and she couldn't get all the way home to her house so we went to the school to rescue her and bring her to our house.  It was warm, dinner was on the stove, it would be fun.  WRONG! The trip from the school to our house was pretty uncomfortable as we were maneuvering an interstate --- trying to stay \"in the grooves' which we have learned to do.  Bear in mind -- north Texas has no snow removal equipment -- and we have much more ice than snow and it usually happens first. So, off we go -- me and the heavily pregnant daughter in her car -- Hubs in ours and we trudge home.  We get here.  We have dinner, we watch movies -- pregnant daughter is missing home - I tuck her in for a long, well deserved sleep.  Then, the unthinkable happens.We. Lose. Our. Power.The next morning we packed up freezing, pregnant daughter and manage to get her home.  The snow was melting at a nice pace and she didn't have a lot of trouble.  We headed to Target for battery operated lights, more necessities of life and we came home to huddle in front of our gas powered fireplace for three days of absolute powerless misery.  The power came on momentarily one  of the nights, long enough for the heater to come on and warm the house, but it was gone again for another day.  One might wonder why our power was off for so long -- so did we.  I can't begin to tell you how livid I was when I found out why.  Seems that ice on trees hanging on the power lines was the culprit -- no surprises there -- but what was surprising was the fact that the fancy schmancy neighbors down the road refused to let the power company trim the trees off the lines so we were left in the cold and dark for three days.  I guess the upscale neighbors found it quaint to be cold or they all took refuge in one of our very nice downtown hotels.I understand that for a lot of people up north, this doesn't sound major but for people who are used to shorts and t-shirt weather most of the time, it is jolting and, honestly, we aren't usually ready.  However, today I am getting ready.  I don't really think I will need it but I am definitely checking out the batteries and the pantry and the toilet tissue and making a quick run to the grocery store.  I babysit tomorrow and I am taking a change of clothes and some pajamas.  Better safe than sorry, I would say!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, November 29, 2012", "text": "Booking Through ThursdayToday's question is really three --can you imagine yourself NOT being a reader?  How does it shape your life?  Your perception of it?The answer to the first question is easy. In a word, no.  When I was small, before I could read, I was fascinated watching my mother read.  When I learned to read, it was my favorite pastime.  I loved to go to the local library, especially in the winter, grab a few books and go home and read.  Of course, there was not much television -- we only had three channels -- no internet  or social media so books were my way to explore the world.  Some of my favorite books were about children in other countries and other cultures.  I managed to work my way through most of our required reading lists all through elementary school.  As I grew, my taste in reading changed and I had to have my share of things like \"Gidget\" and any number of other romantic sorts of things but even those were \"educational\" in a sense.  We were required to read for school in addition to our regular texts and I enjoyed it.  After I got out of school, I continued to read for pleasure and, in fact, found my daughter' s name in a book.  There has never been a book far from my hand, or my purse.How does it shape my life?  Well, I am a strong believer that \"knowledge is power\" and where better to attain knowledge than from books.  It doesn't matter if you are in a directed classroom or doing independent learning -- if you have a book and the desire to learn something then you can do anything. I also use reading as a stress reliever.  I find nothing more relaxing than sitting down with a good book, a cookie and a cuppa, allowing myself to be transported to wherever the book is set and just get lost.  I find that an hour with a good book is probably as good as any drug. How does reading shape my perception of life?  In the first place, when I read, I not only see the world as being wide open to me, I realize how small I am and how much there is out there for me to learn.  I also realize, when reading historical things, how far our society has come and how our life is so different than it was  when this country was founded and even beyond that.   The one genre that has made this possible more than any other is blog reading.  I find it fascinating that I can log on to the computer and read blogs from all over the world written by women of all ages and learn their concerns, their likes, their dislikes and what they do.  I find they aren't so different from me.I feel like my world would be quite narrow if I didn't read -- regardless of what I read or how I get the information.  I can't imagine being in that situation."},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, November 25, 2012", "text": "2012 Reading ChallengeIt is pretty evident that I am not going to be able to finish the 2012 Reading Challenge with the 25 books that I had as my goal.  I came closer this year, and will be able to add a couple of more, but will fall short by a couple.  Next year will be better -- I think.I just finished the latest book in my queue -- \"The Little Stranger\" by Sarah Waters.  It was reasonably lengthy -- just shy of 400 pages -- and took me a little longer than I had wanted it to.  I have read two other works of Waters, one of which I enjoyed, so I thought I would give this one a go and I have to say that it did not disappoint although it was a bit draggy in places, I thought.It is the story of Caroline Ayers and Dr. Faraday with subplots concerning Caroline's mother and brother, Roderick.  It is a tragic story of a tragic family and it all started with the death of the eldest Ayers child -- Susan.  It is clearly a ghost story but it is only implied who the ghost is and the involvement of the ghost is vague -- not to be believed by most of the characters involved with the family.  I would like to say it ends well and, in regards to the parlor maid, Betty, it does but the ending is bittersweet and leaves the reader wondering about the stability of Dr. Faraday in regards to his attachment  to the house -- The Hundreds.It is a good read -- I was able to stay with it and, at the end, couldn't put it down but that is usually my reading style.  It was \"scary\" enough to be a ghost story but much more psychological and frightening in a whole other way.  I will say, it makes me very glad that I am not privileged to own an old -- really old -- English manor house.  I think I would move after reading this.I recommend this book but maybe on a sunny day.  If you are affected by SAD, the gloominess of the setting in this book might be just a bit much.All Too Familiar --It is post-Thanksgiving -- that time that we all sit and commiserate over what we have done (eaten).  We are loping toward another holiday that pretty much centers around all things excessive -- food, alcohol, shopping -- not  necessarily in that order.  We are all looking toward the New Year, as well, replete with it's resolutions.  I am not good at any of this.  I don't overeat on Thanksgiving because I cook it and once the marathon cooking has taken place, I can't be bothered to eat it.  I don't drink and I don't like shopping so all the \"fun\" stuff of the season is wasted on me.  Resolutions?  Eh, just something to be broken as soon as they are written.  Again -- not my gig.However, there is one thing I need to do.  I need to lose weight.  Between my weight and the hard flooring I live with, my feet and knees are aging at an alarming rate and something must be done.  Would I like to wear smaller clothes with a better variety?  Of course.  Would I like to think I had never let myself get to this point?  Uh, yes -- it is a bit embarrassing.  Can I blame it all on heredity?  Well, that is a question, now, isn't it?  I come from a family of short  people.  For the longest time I was the tallest child, measuring 5'5.5\" in my prime.  I kept that honor until my youngest cousin was born and she grew to an adult height of about 5'8\".  I have now  lost about  1.25\" inches which only makes the weight issue more of an -- well -- issue.  My father claimed to be 5'10\" -- he was really 5'8\" and my mother was 5'1\".  So, we are a bit vertically challenged.  My weight would be perfect if I were, say, 6'8\".  If you look at body shape -- well, I look just like my father who tended to be a bit Alfred Hitchcock--ish -- as did his father and my son has followed suit.  Overweight? Yes but the body type is there regardless of weight.  Not much to be done about that. But, working within the parameters of things I cannot change -- I still have to solve the weight issue.I have successfully lost weight twice in my life -- rather large quantities of weight --so you can see this has been an ongoing issue for me since my early 20's.  Each time I have lost weight I have done it by calorie counting.  Yes, a calorie counter (small, grocery store checkout line sort of book) and a spiral notebook were my weapons of choice the first time. The second time was similar only with a bigger calorie counter and the added assistance of informative labels and the internet.  I have been trying to just \"watch\" what I eat which I do quite well -- it just doesn't limit me.  I have tried Weight Watchers online but can't do it because I resent having to pay to use the system plus I think the system just encourages diet foods full of junk we don't need.  I don't eat artificial sweeteners because they make my heart do disturbing flippity flops.So, I will be starting calorie counting again.  I won't use a spiral notebook this time but rather the Lose It! app for my Nook.  It is easy and I usually always have my Nook with me so it is a good way to log what I eat when I am out.  Calorie counts for fast food are readily available now so there is no excuse for not being able to do it.  I won't be waiting until the New Year -- my New Year starts today. Exercise -- yeah, well, that is an issue as well.  Arthritis limits what I can do but I think I will go back and do things old school -- sit ups, toe touching, that sort of thing.  I have a Tony Little Gazelle and a tv in my room which is ok but my knees can only take so much however, they can take the 30 minutes a day that is recommended so we will see. I will let you know how it goes.  Maybe I will add a sidebar to show my calorie counts.  You won't find my weight up there, no sir, but maybe I will post the weight loss.  Maybe that is just too boring. However, I am now off to eat my cup of raisin bran and half cup of milk.  I have already put it in the calorie counter so I guess that means I have officially started my new project."},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, November 24, 2012", "text": "Let the Decorating Commence!It is Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend.  The food is gone, the moment passed, it is now time to move forward, head on, into Christmas!  I am a bit more organized this year.  I have completed the shopping for my grandchildren.  My own children are all grown up and really prefer money so that is easy.  The Hubs usually gives me a list -- mostly mail-order things so that is good.  All in all, I think I am doing ok.I was a bit annoyed yesterday, however.  I allowed myself to go to Target and Michael's late yesterday afternoon -- something I never do on the day after Thanksgiving and for a brief moment I thought I was   \"late\" with the holiday.  Naturally things were in a horrible disarray but that isn't what was so perplexing.  The problem that I was having was the complete lack of Christmas-y things to begin with.  Usually Target has an abundance of wrapping and decorations and this year there were only two aisles dedicated to the holiday.  Maybe the company should re-evaluate their huge remodel and go back to the days of less glitz and more merchandise.I was also annoyed at Michael's.  I went looking for small beads for a cross stitch project and their needlework department in this particular store is appalling -- I could practically hold all the products in my arms! So, off  to Joann's I went and I realized that I really need to visit my cute little local needlework store which isn't so local.  It is The Stitch Niche in Arlington -- not far but not around the corner, either. Going there takes up a morning by the time you figure the drive back and forth with the traffic and then the time spent in the store which is never really short.  It is one of those stores that you can't walk into, pick up what you want and leave.  It lures you in.  It is one of those charming, magical places that is small, packed full of merchandise and, while it it is well organized, you still have to look through things to find what you what you want and that is like opening Pandora's box! Anyway, I digress.  Today will be spent decorating the house.  We put up the Christmas Village which has now become the Hubs project -- thank goodness -- he is much better at it than I am.  All that is left to do on that is the accessorizing and decorating the tree that is in the middle of the \"village\".  For the last couple of years I have been putting up a \"big\" tree in addition to the tree in the village but since we will not be home for Christmas this year I decided to dispense with that tree and just add a few little decorations around the house -- a few candles, some decorative hand towels in the guest bath -- that sort of thing.  I usually hang stockings -- a couple of generic, monogrammed ones made from blue velvet for Hubs and me and then I hang two handmade (from a kit) stockings that my grandmother made for my children on their first Christmas.  My son was only 20 days old when he first used his -- my daughter was three months old so these have been around for a while, used each year and are showing their age but each year when I hang them I remember my grandmother and smile and that is what it is all about.So, now that the morning tea has been consumed, it is time to get busy.  I will be done with my part long before the Hubs is done with his -- he definitely has the more labor intensive job.  Perhaps photos will follow.Have a wonderful Saturday!"},

I enjoyed this movie much more than \"Spencer's Mountain\" which was also based on the life of Earl Hamner, Jr.  It was set in the same time period as the TV series and I have always been a big fan of Richard Thomas so I thought it more realistic.So, that is the start of my Christmas movie watching.  I don't know what will be next -- stay tuned to find out!As far as today is going - I am stitching! All day! Leftover for dinner, Hubs is putting up the Christmas village and I am just allowing myself to sit and enjoy a hobby that I usually do in snatches.  This is the project -- and I am zipping right along with it and having a wonderful time!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, November 22, 2012", "text": "Happy Thanksgiving to all!I am not going to lie, Thanksgiving is not my favorite holiday.  It is a ton of work for so little reward.  We have had some pretty miserable Thanksgivings in the past and that always seems to be in the forefront of my mind each year as I boil mounds of potatoes for salad and stand on my feet for hours chopping and compiling and trying to please everybody.  However, with that said, I love the smell of the house after all that effort, I love the gathering of the family under my roof -- a couple of hours with my family together at home is worth all the effort and, of course, it is the kick-off to the best season of the year -- Christmastide!So, after we gather together this evening, say our prayers for all the blessings we have been granted this year (and there have been many) and try not to eat ourselves into oblivion, the Christmas movie watching will ensue.  I have a rather sizable stack of Christmas-y DVD's and I love to go through them each year and enjoy a few to get me into the spirit.  I am not sure what I will start with, maybe my favorite \"The Bell's of St. Mary's\" with it's infamous Nativity play scene.  I will see what the Hubs would like to see and go from there.Then tomorrow -- yes, it is Christmas full steam ahead.  Hubs is already working on the Christmas village set up -- improving it and making it easier to do -- pics will follow.  I think by Sunday all will be set up and ready to go.  This year I am determined to get everything set  up early enough so that I can actually enjoy it, not be in such a rush and not be so late so that I feel like I have to take it right back down! Now, I just have to find Tuppy -- my elf on the shelf -- I know he is here somewhere -- Tuppy, where are you?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, November 11, 2012", "text": "And the Oscar Goes To----I love movies.  I have always loved movies.  My family loved movies.  As I child, I spent many hours at one of our neighborhood theaters -- the Olmos -- watching movies with either my parents or my cousin, JLSHall.  There were many Saturday evenings that we walked to El Rancho Mexican Restaurant, across the street from the theater, had dinner and then went to the movies.  It was all so exciting but what was even more exciting was having my mom pick me up from school and, instead of going home, we went to the movie where they had been for the afternoon and were finishing up the film.  I saw \"Porgy and Bess\" one of those particular times.  I have to say that all of my dates with my husband were to movies with the occasional exception of a school dance.  So, without a doubt, movies have been a huge part of my life.It is rare that I actually go to a movie theater these days.  They are too expensive and, quite honestly, I have never liked crowds so I prefer to watch my movies via Netflix or cable stations.  I do enjoy on-demand viewing as well and that is how I saw a movie reviewed  by my friend Gill at That British Woman.  The movie, \"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\", was one that I had been wanting to see anyway but after Gill had reviewed it she  asked her American followers what they thought about the all- British cast and whether we appreciated the typical British humor and I felt compelled to watch the movie and let her know my opinions.  Actually, it was a great excuse to watch something besides sports!I enjoyed the movie completely but then it was a showcase for many of my favorite actors.  I love Judi Dench and Bill Nighy.  I loved Celie Imrie in that comedy she used to play in -- can't remember the title -- and she was just as enjoyable in this film.  Maggie Smith -- what can I say -- she is in a class of actresses that I fear is never to be repeated -- well, except for possibly Meryl Streep.  The humor didn't escape me but then I have watched enough  British television and movies in my life -- not to mention talking with my son-in-law -- that I have a good working knowledge of the language differences, the dry sense of humor, the sarcastic nuances.  It was a great movie and I will watch it again which brings me to the subject of \"watching it again\".  Joy and I used to watch movies, in a theater, over and over.  Sometimes we would sit through them twice, sometimes we would make it another Saturday outing but I can't remember the number of times we viewed \"West Side Story\" or \"The Longest Day\".  My favorites were the musicals and my poor husband had to endure \"Funny Girl\" about three times -- and now I have it on DVD and he retreats.Recently I have been  watching a lot of movies and, when I get \"down\" or nostalgic or don't feel well, I tend to revisit the movies of my youth.  The changing seasons make me a bit sentimental so, it comes as no surprise to me that my recent viewings were older choices. The Hubs and I enjoyed watching \"Spencer's Mountain\"  (1963) with Henry Fonda and Maureen O'Hara.  It was based on the writings of Earl Hamner and was the movie that the television series \"The Waltons\" was based on.  However, it was more modern day than the television series and I have to say I much preferred \"The Homecoming: A Christmas Story\" (1971) with Patricia Neal and Richard Thomas.  It took place in the depression era, as the television series did, and I just preferred it.  \"The Homecoming\" is in  my queue of Christmas movies that I watch each year.Another movie that we watched was a favorite when I was a young teenager -- \"The World of Suzie Wong\" with William Holden and Nancy Kwan.  It is the story of a beautiful Chinese prostitute working in Hong Kong.  Her path crosses that of William Holden, an relationship ensues, a tragedy occurs and there is still a happy ending as only could be found in a 1963 movie.  One might ask why I, as a thirteen year old, was watching a movie about a prostitute -- well, trust me -- it was completely benign and not at all unsuitable for a 13 year old -- by today's standards, it was absolutely Disney.  I have seen this movie any number of times and it is still a tear jerker for me and I enjoy it every time I see it.I really enjoy watching vintage movies -- especially when the weather changes.  The only thing better than curling up to watch an old movie is curling up with a good book! I will talk about that next time."},

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, September 26, 2012", "text": "Ah, The Best Laid Plans.....OK, a little more than a year ago I decided to change things up in life.  One of my goals was to lessen our expenditures of money and be a little more eco-friendly.  I started line drying clothes, I unplugged everything, I turned off lights -- my husband laughed at me.  I didn't care.  I also tried to develop a new outlook on life in general -- again, more green -- more natural -- more vegetarian.  I went about it as I usually do when I start something new -- I jump in with both feet.  As usual, some things don't stick, I can't keep up with it all or I lose interest.  Now is the time to take inventory of how I am doing.I am still line drying clothes -- to a certain extent.  After Hubs complained about crunchy towels I started drying them again but I still line dry my personal things, most of my shirts and slacks and I absolutely refuse to spend energy drying kitchen towels!  I am still making my own laundry detergent -- I really do prefer it -- and I am still using vinegar for softener.  I have also fallen hopelessly in love with Bon Ami and buy it by the multiples.I have reached a happy medium with the dishwasher.  I try to wash up whatever I have used immediately but use the dishwasher when I have a large load -- I have even managed to teach Hubs to not run the d/w with four cups, a couple of glasses and three cereal bowls.  He has learned -- I guess he got tired of hearing me yell.I have managed to curb my magazine addiction.  I am gradually getting rid of subscriptions and the mags I really like, I am subscribing to on my Nook.  They are just as easy to read and look at but not so much clutter.  I have also quit buying books for the moment.  I have enough that I haven't read to last quite a while so I am making a point of avoiding the bookstores and, instead of buying everything that strikes my fancy, I make a wish list and then find a way to get them at a better price.  It has come to my attention, however, that my latest Nook purchase -- the 16 GB tablet, was probably not the best.  After doing a little research today, I think I should have taken a closer look at Kindle Fire.  I was very surprised to learn that the books for Kindle are quite a bit less expensive than for Nook.  However, when our neighborhood library's renovations are complete, I will probably be visiting there first before I acquire any books -- physical or virtual.  I have gotten rid of most of the plastic in the house and what I have purchased is BPA free.  I have bought a number of the Ball freezer jars because I have trained myself to store leftovers for immediate use or freeze for later use.  Hubs won't eat leftovers, but, hey, I am not proud.  I love leftovers and will eat them, even prefer them, most any day.We are never going to quit eating out.  It is just part of our routine now.  With just two of us, with completely different preference in food, it is just easier sometimes.  However, we are learning how to cut those bills as well and it is working well.  We have figured out that, if we are going to eat out, eat out at lunch.  The lunch menus are cheaper and have smaller portions which is great for us.  That way we don't over-indulge or end up carrying half our dinner home with us.  We have also found that many times, the food tastes better and fresher at lunch.  It is also a lot quieter.  I have become very sensitive to noisy restaurants -- can't stand them -- so lunch seems to work for us as well.  Also, when we agree on what to have, we share.Now, my downfall -- the plant based diet.  I have completely abandoned it and I don't feel so good for it.  However, when we do eat at home, Hubs is doing a lot of the cooking since I am babysitting these days, and he is just not a vegetable person whereas I am.  So, I am going to have to figure out how to incorporate more veggies and not hurt his feelings.  I am not opposed to frozen vegetables and actually like to stock up on them so I am just going to have to make a point of steaming them for myself if he doesn't want them.  I have a new mid-year resolution in regards to expenditure of money.  I would like to keep a record of what I spend and what I save and try to not buy anything without a coupon or a store reward card or something.  When my children were little I made a game of couponing -- I tried to have a coupon for everything on my list and I saved gobs of money.  Now, it isn't so easy because I don't shop the same way I used to.  We use a lot more natural products and fresh produce and there are never coupons for those things but I am still going to make an effort to do as much saving as possible on everything I buy and I would like to keep a record of it so I can see that I really am saving money.  I still haven't bought a new toaster oven.  I know what I want but I am waiting for the old toaster to pass on.  It seems to be trucking right along, however, so who knows but I am not keen to replace it when I have one that is working.  I know that a toaster oven would be cheaper to run and will replace the pop-up but not until it need be.So, I don't know, how am I doing?  I am trying to find a happy medium between being over indulgent and too frugal.  It requires analyzing every move I make and I am not used to that -- I, like most, am a creature of habit and sometimes I find myself doing things the old way and then realize I could have done something better.  Old dog/new tricks?  I don't think I am that old, just a bit set in my ways and I need to focus!!! Honestly, I don't think I am doing too bad -- just need to get the eating under control -- more plants, less sugar, NO soda (that is the hardest) and not be so hard on myself.Last but not least -- time.  I need to make better use of my time.  Less television, definitely less facebook, more books, more music, more genealogy, more exercise, more creativity.  Again -- focus.  So, that is my report card --- now to start keeping track of things."},

{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, September 16, 2012", "text": "Hello, Blog,I guess by now you figure I have deserted you for bigger and better things -- emails, social media, heck, maybe even the newspaper but alas, that is not true.  I have been spending a lot of time thinking lately and organizing everything in my life, or trying to.  Quite a challenge, I have to admit -- especially when talking about magazines, but I digress.One of the  things I have been thinking about is you.  I bet you don't know you have a name, do you?  Oh, I know, the top of the page reads \"Boyett-Brinkley\" but that is MY name.  Your name has always been a secret because it sounds a bit eccentric to actually \"name\" something like you but you do have one.  It is a special name, suggested to me by my father for a business I wanted to start.  I guess that is another reason why I have never published it -- it was sort of a poignant moment between me and my father in his later days and I guess I wanted to keep it that way.  However, I guess it is time to share your name.  You would be Tinklepaw.  Tinklepaw Boyett-Brinkley.So, Tinklepaw, one of the things I have been thinking about in regards to you is what your purpose is.  Did I create you for my own purpose --  a diary so to speak -- or did I create you for the entertainment of others?  Are you here to showcase things I do or see, to be a venue to share thoughts to be read by others or  are you here to be a place for me to share private thoughts?  I have never been one to share private thoughts much -- they wouldn't be private then, would they -- so I doubt that is your purpose.  I know, for sure, one of the reasons you were created -- maybe the primary reason -- is to give me a place to write. I have always been a reader and, as so many readers do, I have always wanted to write.  I did a lot of creative writing in school -- high school and college -- and many times my work was confiscated to be used as examples which was always a great feeling.  When I was a young mom with a toddler at my feet and a baby on my lap, I took a creative writing course with the idea of actually writing for profit.  About a dozen works later and many times that the number of rejection letters I sort of put the dream on the back burner -- I still have the work, however.  Who knows -- maybe one day I will self publish. I did try my hand a poetry once.  It wasn't a concerted effort; it wasn't that I sat down one day and said \"today I will try my hand at poetry\" -- it was more that the words struck and I had to write them down.  I HAD to write them down, in the night, or I couldn't sleep.  One was about my son, a newborn at the time.  It was about the awesome wonder I felt at his very existence, the ethereal quality of the softness of his skin, the strawberry blond \"duck down\" he had for hair -- I still remember the overwhelming feeling of love that had overcome me when I wrote it.  The other was about the tragic life of a little boy who lived down the street from us.  He was about nine, we were helpless.  He is still living, in his forties, still tragic and most likely helpless.  Over the course of a number of moves, the poems have been lost.  They can't be reproduced because they were done \"in the moment\".  Were they great poetry?  No.  However, they were my feelings at the time and I wish I still had them.So, I guess in regards to your purpose, you are all of the above -- a well rounded blog, which I think you are, would have elements of all the things I mentioned -- maybe even some private thoughts although I am pretty protective of those.  However, I think you should be more for me than for others pleasure.  Taking this viewpoint would help with the guilt I feel if I don't write, or post, for a while.  I feel like I am letting people down if I don't post something with gorgeous photos, or in depth book reviews or witty observations of things on a daily basis.  I need to take the approach of quality over quantity.  Yet, with that said, I need to be more organized and not let you be on your own for unreasonably long periods of time -- who know was a bored blog might do, after all.So, since I have been negligent about writing for the last few weeks, I guess I should bring you up to speed on the things of life around here.  Our brother-in-law had a heart attack about six weeks ago.  He is fine, it was a very near miss and he is fortunate that he works in a hospital and has an observant secretary.  He is doing well and apparently sustained very minor heart damage and was cleared to go back to work after a week.  He didn't but he could and he is very lucky.  My aunt had a heart procedure done, an ablation, to help correct the atrial fibrillation she has had for years.  It was a success and she is enjoying a regular heart beat for the first time in a long time and she is even being taken off some of her meds.  However, she discovered a lump and has been diagnosed with a rare form a breast cancer.  That is the bad news.  The good news is that it seems to be a slow growing, non-metastatic form that attacks older women.  We are waiting to learn the treatment plan but I have a feeling she is going to be fine.  About a month ago B had a really bad allergic reaction to something she had touched, not eaten.  Her little face swelled up and she was put on prednisone to get the allergy under control -- nobody knows what created the problem but her parents think it was a down comforter she was playing on.  Two weeks later she had another allergy attack resulting in bronchiolitis -- and more prednisone.  She seems to be fine now but apparently our allergy season is getting started early -- as my aunt used to say -- \"if it's not one &*#% thing, it's another\".  I miss my aunt.For some ridiculous reason, I have been obsessing over purses.  I have been looking for the perfect purse -- large enough to hold everything I need but not bulky, not leather because that is too heavy and not Vera Bradley because, being a child of the 50's I feel like I have to \"match\" and find myself changing my purse all the time when I carry Vera because one print does not fit all and, when I have to change purses, I invariably leave something essential behind.  Yes, that was an unnecessarily long sentence.  So, I purchased this at JCP --No, I didn't buy green but it was a lovely green.  There was also a butter yellow and a British Tan color but I opted for the black.  Yes, blah black.  Black goes with everything.  I would have preferred it without the tacky metal logo thingy but what can you do.  It fits everything and doesn't have magnetic snaps which I was afraid would affect my tablet.  There is room to spare and a big pocket on the back that I can put my keys and phone in and not lose them in the bottom of the bag.  I have carried it for two days now and it seems to be ok. I have been trying to get in more reading time -- another priority.  I am working on two books right now -- something I rarely do -- it gets too confusing.  The first book is The Little Stranger   by Sarah Waters.  I am really \"into\" this book but it is a slow go.  The second title I am reading is on my Nook and it is An Irish Country Doctor.  I have just started this one but I think it will hook me as well -- I have never tried to read  two very compelling books at once -- it will be an experience.I have some cross stitch projects that I am itching to get into but the weather change and the rain have left my hands aching.  It isn't like my joints get red and swell, although they do that sometimes, but more of an ache in the palm of my hand and if I twist my hand a certain way it is very painful.  When this happens I am very clumsy so the idea of holding a needle is not very appealing.  The same thing is happening to my feet, as well.  I am sort of a crippy mess, actually.  I am very thankful that I have my little Nook Simple Touch -- it is much easier to hold than a big 400-500 page hardback book.  I never though I would opt for an e-reader over books because, to me, books are treasures but the NST is quite a blessing on some days.I guess the whole idea of the e-reader is just another facet of my thought process lately -- how to do things in the most efficient way for me and the Hubs.  The funny part about it is that, in order to effect more efficiency, I have had to revert back to some of the things we used to do \"old school\".  Hanging a calendar on the wall is one thing ---  Hubs missed a dental appointment because, being retired, he doesn't have a calendar on the home computer to alert him to things like that.  I have a calendar on my tablet and have it filled  but it is a pain to mess with it.  I have a notebook planner that I have everything written down on but sometimes it is with me and not there for him to look at.  So -- I bought one of those nifty \"Mom\" calendars  to put on the pantry door.  I have color coordinated the entries and it even has a tablet of paper for lists and menus and such.  I am using a \"command hook\" to hang it up with and now we have no excuses for missing appointments or not knowing what is for dinner!  I never thought that, in my old age, I would have to keep learning new ways to do things more efficiently.  I guess it makes sense though, because as we age and little challenges crop up -- like sore hands, we have to find ways to adapt. Another thing that I have done recently is something I have wanted to do for a long time and never had the courage to do and then regretted not doing it.  Hmmm....that was a little vague, wasn't it.  Ok, I have taken the initiative to get in touch with people that I have lost touch with.  Last year, when a classmate passed away, I spoke to his ex-wife, who I also went to school with, and mentioned that I had a special photo of this man and she said she would like to have a copy for his brother.  As I was making the copy I got to thinking about my very best friend in kindergarten who was also in the photo (it was a group, class photo).  She passed away in around 1991 so I found her daughter and sent her a copy.  I also reached out and wrote a letter to my second grade teacher.  She is the only teacher I had in elementary school that is still living and she was my favorite teacher.  I felt compelled to write her and she remembered me.  I also sent a birthday card to my algebra teacher on her 93rd birthday.  These are the types of things I have always wanted to do but was never bold enough to do it.  Now I have and I enjoyed it.  Now I won't regret not having done it.Well, Tinklepaw, it is time to close.  Never fear, little blog, you have not been replaced by Facebook or Google +.  Those things are fine, for what they are, instant gratification.  You have more meaning, though, more substance and I want you to represent the deeper thinking me, the me that actually has something to say worth listening to.  So, again, quality over quantity -- that is our goal."},

It seems all I want to do is read. I did manage to do a couple of loads of laundry -- I didn't have much so I feel accomplished in that regard.  Other than that -- I have just sat here with no energy and no drive to do much of anything. I hope these doldrums leave soon because I have a lot of things to get busy with -- I have a \"to - do\" list a mile long and just sitting here with a stuffy head and stuffy ears and itchy eyes isn't go to help me much. So, hopefully, after a good nights sleep my energy will come back and I will be back to my perky self.  In the meantime, I think I will have some Tylenol with my scrambled eggs and biscuits."},

Sometimes you try to take a situation full of lemons and make lemonade but there isn't a pitcher in sight.  Sometimes you can't do anything but give up.Around the house I am cleaning, organizing and trying to keep things up -- getting easier as  I change my vision.I am pondering how to organize old photos.  The new photos are digital and on the computer, the old photos are in boxes.  I have tried albums -- not enough room for them.  I have tried boxes -- they don't match and that annoys me.  I bought a nifty thing at the Container Store but took it back because the boxes seem better.  So....photos still in boxes and I am still pondering.A favorite quote for the day: \"you are kind, you are smart, you are important\"  from \"The Help\".  This should be everybody's goal and mantra.  Especially the \"kind\" part.One of my favorite things is curling up on a Sunday evening to watch \"Masterpiece Theater\" which, by the way, isn't on tonight.A few plans for the week include babysitting, laundry, and reading.A peek into my day  --"},

However, for today, in the spirit of my friend Gill, I would like to share a link.  I read my hometown newspaper (that would be San Antonio, Texas) every morning and I noticed this house in their real estate section.  There are things about it I like -- the kitchen for instance -- and things I don't.  Who in the world needs a dozen bathrooms to clean up?  Goodness, hubs and I would never see each other in this house!  The land it is on is lovely, however.  Perhaps I could lease out the big house and build a little house in the back!Moving on, I am currently reading \"So Far Away\" by Meg Mitchell Moore.  It is a very captivating story about three women whose lives intersect in a very unusual way and yet each one learns from the other.  It isn't a particularly long book and I am half done.  One of the perks of babysitting is that I have at least a two hour stretch of reading time every afternoon.  Of course, I fall sound asleep for about a half hour (getting up at 5:30 a.m. finds me ready for a nap at noon, for sure).  However, I am getting lots of reading accomplished and enjoying the time guilt free.So, it is time for me to hit the road -- just about.  I have about a 45 minute drive but, fortunately, the rest of the city must be slow risers because the traffic isn't too bad.  As soon as I get the computer figured out it will be joining me so I won't be so far away from the blogsphere.Toodles (as Bean says, thanks to Minnie Mouse) and I will be back soon!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, July 25, 2012", "text": "Rev. with Tom HollanderI was doing a little research on Hulu.com, never having paid much attention to it I wasn't really sure of what was available for my viewing pleasure.  I am pretty particular about what movies and television shows I watch so I didn't want to subscribe to a service that is not going to give me enough bang for my buck -- I already have cable that does THAT!  As it turns out, Hulu can be viewed over my little netbook for free or for an added fee, I can watch it on the television -- even though I can't.  In order to watch it on the television I would need a streaming device -- a video game player or something like Roku.  Well, I own a Wii but Hulu doesn't use Wii so that led me to look at the Roku which is again, another added fee.  I didn't want an added fee so, even though I would like the Hubs to watch with me, for now I am opting to just watch alone on my netbook. While I was doing all this \"research\" and looking around, I discovered a new British comedy entitled \"Rev.\" with Tom Hollander.  It is the story of a small village Church of England priest finding himself the rector of a large, run down, inner - city church in London.  It is comedic, but not in the \"Vicar of Dibley\" way, perhaps running more to the \"Soul Man\" (US tv, late 1990's, Dan Akyroyd) format.  In any event, I watched two episodes with netbook on lap and headphones in ears and after about a few minutes, didn't even realize I was watching a computer so I think this can work for me without any other fees or equipment.  The only annoying thing was the commercials but I would have those on regular television, now, wouldn't I, so not a real problem.I think Tom Hollander is one of my favorite contemporary British actors.  I have seen him in more things than I can remember, the first being \"The Very Thought of You\" with Joseph Fiennes, Monica Potter and Rufus Sewell.  He is so  versatile in his roles as is evidenced by the contrast of his character, Daniel, in \"The Very Thought of You\" and his performance as the affable priest, Adam, in \"Rev.\".  If I wasn't old enough to be his mother I might actually swoon a bit. So, if you are in the mood for something of this nature I would recommend \"Rev.\".  It is funny, it is serious, it is timely (especially for those of us of the Anglican persuasion), the scenery is interesting and the cast top notch.  There  are only six episodes in the first season with the second season to be available in November.  It is only available on Hulu, in the US.  It can't be purchased on DVD in the US or viewed in any other venue.  I watched two episodes last night and I am sure I will probably watch the rest tonight. So, there you go -- something new and different and completely enjoyable!"},

I am blaming it on the heat.It is unbearably hot here and, even though the air conditioning is keeping the house comfortable, if you have to get out for anything it is really bad and saps the very life out of you -- you can almost hear a big sucking noise as every ounce of moisture leaves your body!We went to a family reunion on Saturday in the miniscule town (is it even a town?) -- community- of Elk, Texas.  There isn't much in Elk, Texas but it's claim to fame is that it is the home of the whole David Koresh and Branch Davidian saga of 1991.  The church, St. Joseph's Catholic Church, where we have this biennial reunion, was the parking spot for all the military equipment brought in to deal with the \"situation\".  There is a plaque.  The reunion is always nice -- my husband's family was, at one time, quite large -- a grandma and grandpa and twelve children who married and had their own children and so on and so forth.  The family didn't start hosting these get togethers until after Grandma's death -- I think this was the twelfth one.  So, we have seen huge groups of  my mother-in-law's sisters and brothers, all of their children (and there are many) and THEIR children.  In the 90's there were so many kids you couldn't keep up with who was who.  Then something happened.  As my mother-in-law's generation just kept on going, we were losing their children and even two of the little children.   Once this was a large Czech family living in a large Czech farming community but, as the years have gone on the younger generation has married outside the community and moved to the cities -- given up farming and taking jobs in science, accounting and education.  Their children have grown up never knowing much about this little town with the one Catholic church which was the center of all activity -- along with the SPJST dance hall!  It was such a contrast this year -- three sisters -- Marguerite, Olene, and Dorothy -- two sisters-in-law -- Rosalie and Rose all sitting in a little huddle talking about old times.  Rose, age 98 had driven herself which was probably not a good idea.  Olene, 93, has really rebounded from several years of being \"under the weather\" and was more robust than I had seen her in years.  Dorothy hasn't changed much over the years, her childhood polio coming back on her as time goes on.  Rosalie is recovering from a limb loss due to some inherited illness -- don't know what it is.  There they sat -- all these women, much shorter than they used to be, all sporting walkers of various colors -- except for Rose who stood straight and tall.  One brother remains -- Theodore, who stood tall and thin and could remember everything about the dances and barbecues at the SPJST lodge -- they were all tripping down memory lane over photos that Carolyn had had copied for everyone of the old \"homeplace\" as they are fond of calling the family farm.  They are lucky -- yes, they are old but they are here and sharp enough to be  able to look at those  photos and remember -- not everybody's family is that lucky.  Now, their stories don't always match up, mind you, but then there is the good natured arguing over who is right! Great fun to watch and in doing so you realize how blessed this family has been.  It was a sparse gathering, however, not many of our generation were there and the only little children were my three grandchildren -- Nathan, Kathryn and Caroline and my great-nephew, Dante.Dante and the Bean aka CarolineThis book must have been really good!Dante, Bean and Mommy BeanDante and mom Jill, Bean and mom Bri -- Jill and Bri, first cousins are one month apart in age as are the babes!There are photos of my other two grandchildren but their parents prefer that their photos are not published on the internet.So, after we made it there and back in one piece, I spent yesterday in an exhausted heap in my chair surfing the net.  I was looking at these --I think these are so cool and would look great in my house.  I have very high ceilings and this would take  up no floor space and my clothes would dry really quickly in my warm laundry room close to the ceiling.  I even saw, on one website, one of these installed over the bathtub.  Very nice! I think I might be getting one of these --- maybe.Then, I was looking around at Hulu and discovered a new Britcom with Tom Hollander called \"Rev\".  I would love to see this show but it is only available on Hulu and I am not one to watch tv on the computer.  I was looking to see if I could buy the DVD's -- yes, but they are only in the British format.  Well, darn.  So, I went looking to see if I could access Hulu through my Wii.  No, only through Playstation.  Well, darn.  So, I found that I could get the show through Amazon instant video -- I could buy the whole series! Could I get that through my Wii?  No, only through Roku and Playstation.  Well, darn.  So, I started researching these --They are affordable and small and you can get a lot of stuff by using this but...wouldn't it just be easier to watch the show on the computer?  I am beginning to think so.It was a good weekend for mail order, as well.  I had ordered these two sampler patterns from The Sampler Girl and they arrived.  My original order was the Diamond Jubilee sampler but there was a mix up in the order and the lovely lady at The Sampler Girl told me to choose an additional pattern for all my trouble.  I assured her that it was no trouble, \"stuff\" happens and that she didn't need to make it up to me but she did and I received the Kate and William sampler as well.  This is why I love dealing with my small business contacts and bloggy friends businesses -- they are just wonderful people.  So, now I am the proud owner of ---I also have this one to work on which I bought in honor of my family -- being a Davis and Welsh and all.  I would love  to change the colors as I am not a pink/green sort of person but I will see.As I am  \"off\" quilting at the moment and the baby doesn't need any new clothes right yet, I am going to really enjoy stitching these little lovelies and I am going to use my new Carolina linen aida for them.  Hopefully I will remember to take photos of my progress. I have also been reading \"East End Jubilee\" which I am enjoying a LOT.  It is a real guilty pleasure.  I also have been reading \"Anthem\" by Ayn Rand which my daughter is going to read as I believe it is taught in the English classes that she will be teaching this year.  It is a bit depressing and a little like \"A Handmaid's Tale\".  It is short and a quick read but more than a little creepy.  If I was reading this as a high school freshman, I would be very depressed!  But, hey, I have  never read any of Rand's work so it is enlightening.So, that is what I have been up to here at Chateau Brinkley.  Not a lot but not totally tragic either.   So, now I am off to see The Bean and do a bit of meal planning.

We hosted the Bean's b/day party here a week ago and, since it was an indoor/outdoor party, I supplied our guests with two varieties of repellent -- Burts Bees Natural and Off! with DEET.  I think most of the folks opted for the natural variety, if anything, but it was far from pleasant.  So, this morning I am researching homemade, natural options.  I already have several recipes for homemade cleaning products and homemade personal care products so this will just be another facet of my \"do it myself and feel better about the whole thing\"  approach. So, as I grocery shop today I will be looking for a little notebook in which to house all my recipes and as I think about it I am reminded of  a book that I completely enjoyed called \"The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane\" by Katherine Howe, a descendant of one of the ladies involved in the Salem witch trials.It is alarming how my collection of essential oils is growing -- I especially love orange -- but I am so concerned about what is in the products we use on  an every day basis that I really feel that I have no choice but to concoct my own.  Granted, I am not a spring chicken and I have been doing what I do for a long time from using ready made deodorants to drinking the now-declared carcinogenic Coca-Cola and changing things now probably won't make a difference for me.  However, it will for the children and I think it is my duty to try.So, I will be creating my own little Physick Book of LissieLou -- hopefully I can find a really cute little book!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, July 08, 2012", "text": "Books or Nooks -- what is YOUR pleasure?I am a complete contradiction.  I pride myself on striving to live a \"green\" lifestyle yet I love technology.  I don't know what to do with it -- can't program it, can't fix it, can only push buttons, not a geek, but I love the concept.When the first generation Nook came out I really wanted one.  I looked, shopped, thought, rationalized and then I bought it.  I loved it.  I was happy with my little Nook.  I really liked the idea of being able to rack up sizable credit card bills to Barnes and Noble while sitting in my easy chair.  It was easy to read, easy to hold, easy to put in a purse.  It took a load off my bulging bookshelves because it is clearly evident that I will never, ever quit buying books.Then the Nook color came out.  Yep, I bought one.  It is very nice for Angry Birds but I don't enjoy reading on it as much because it is glarey.  The battery life is pathetic. Not long after the Nook color came to live in our house, the Nook Simple Touch was born and up for adoption.  Yep, like a stray puppy, I couldn't resist and I brought it home.  It is beyond cute and lives in a hot pink cover with a quote from Hans Christian Anderson embossed on the front cover.  It is easy to read with the e-ink technology (like the original Nook) and has a phenomenal battery life -- about a month.  So small, it fits great in a purse and is light as a feather.So, why, with all of this reading (and Angry Birds) opportunity around me do I still want to buy physical books? I had this conversation with a sales person at B&N just the other day.  The books are slightly less expensive on the Nook which is a plus but I think the problem is that if you love books -- not just reading but the actual book, when you use an e-reader you don't feel like you are getting anything for your money.  The sales person told me that while they sell lots of e-readers, their actual book sales aren't being affected at all.  She agreed with my idea that when you buy virtual books you don't really feel like you have anything for your money.So......Nook has come out with two new products -- a tablet and a Simple Touch with a light.  So far I have resisted both but  I am not sure for how long.  The tablet would be nice for the computer capability rather than the  reading capability.  The new Simple Touch is great for people who  read in bed and don't want to disturb another person.  I don't read in bed so I don't see that I need to replace my first little ST.  However, I do have a netbook that I carry around with me sometimes and wonder if I really need another device, like a tablet, to do the same thing.  I think not.A couple of days ago I wasn't feeling up to par so I just sort of sat around and \"surfed\" all day.  By the end of the day I was exhausted and I hadn't done anything.  Visiting FB numerous times was tiring -- I don't think I am really FB material because I don't feel the need to share my every thought with the cyber world but it is nice to contact relatives with.  I did some blog reading which I enjoy immensely and spent way too much time on Pinterest.  Oh, the television was going the entire time as well.  I wasn't watching it -- it was just on.  Noise pollution at its best. Even my husband suggested we turn off the tv and read. As evening drew in, I turned off all the devices, lowered the lights a bit and grabbed a new read -- a physical book -- curled up and immersed myself in the life of Rose of Ruby Street at the time of Queen Elizabeth's coronation.  It was like a weight was lifted off my shoulders and I could relax. It was wonderful and has shifted my attention back to my budding \"green\" lifestyle which is really where I want to be living.So, what is it for you -- e-readers or books?  Why? How has technology affected your lifestyle -- better, worse?  I don't think we will ever go back or do without technology but has it taken over too much of our lives?  It is definitely food for thought."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, July 06, 2012", "text": "Gypsy Boy by Mikey WalshI have never known much about the gypsy culture except what everybody knows -- colorful caravans, wild ways, untrustworthy, scammers, curses, etc.  There was a gypsy lady who had a fortune telling business in her home at the end of our block.  She walked by our house one day and waved at my mother -- a gesture my  mother chose to ignore -- and the next day our house burned down.  The gypsy didn't have anything to do with it -- a leaky hot water heater was the culprit -- but to my superstitious mother, we had been cursed.  I almost hit the same lady with the car a few years later -- nothing happened.  Maybe she like me?? I don't believe in curses.  In any event, I was surprised when I moved to the Fort Worth area to learn that we have a sizable gypsy (Irish Traveler) community here.  We learned about it when the much publicized story of Madelyn Toogood viciously whipping her child in a parking lot in South Carolina came out. Yep, she is part of Ft. Worth's gypsy community. During that same time period a group of under aged Traveler boys were out joy riding in cars, had a wreck and several were killed.  It was then that I started doing a little reading about Irish Travelers, especially in our area but it was a short lived interest and fell by the way until reality TV gave us Our Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and the American version which isn't nearly as good. One day, while in my favorite Barnes and Noble, I ran across this book by Mikey Walsh.  I bought it thinking it was going to be the humorous, male version of the tv shows I faithfully DVR so I never miss an episode.  Well, I was wrong.  The book is well written and compelling.  It isn't a long read but it is the most painful book I have ever actually completed.  Most anything I pick up that involves violence toward helpless children either never comes into my possession or is ditched immediately upon discovery of the subject matter.  I had a big problem with VC Andrews books for that same reason.In any event, I had to finish it to make sure that Mikey came out of it ok.  Spoiler here, he did, but this little boy had such a horrific life that I am completely shocked and baffled as to how he survived, much less flourished.  But, he did. If you don't get squeamish about pure evil being projected onto small children, then I would recommend this book if you really want to know what life in the Romany world can be like.  It isn't like what is portrayed on tv.  I am not saying that all Romany or Travelers are like this, I am sure they aren't, but one is enough and it is vividly portrayed here.The book is permanently in my library but I doubt I will be reading it again.  Once is, indeed, enough."},

One of those places is the Southwest Craft Center housed in the old Ursuline Academy building.  I am sorry to say that we didn't see much of the art and crafts of the center but, instead, got caught up in the history, museum, architecture and beauty of the building and the grounds of the Ursuline Academy.  I have included a link at the end of this post if you want to do some more reading on the academy but I think I would like the photos to tell their own story.Lunch at the Copper Kettle, the cafe that is operated in the original dining hall of the schoolOriginal window facing and hardware in rather thick limestone wallsHallway seatingOld and new -- interesting juxtapositionFrench style architecture and light fixture -- and I really shouldn't try for \"arty\" photosFenced CourtyardLarge CourtyardRear GroundsVery large gazebo now used mostly for weddings and special events.  Original wrought iron arched signGate in the back garden with large light fixtureYou don't readily see this cross but, when you look up and see it, it seems to be silently watching over the entire campusTurntable to pass items, probably communion wafers, from inside the convent to the outside worldGothic windowGrotto Balcony outside original dormitoriesThree sided clock tower -- story goes that there was no clock on the north facing side because there  was nobody on the north side to see the clock!For more information on Ursuline Academy check out the website belowhttp://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kbu04www.swschool.orgwww.sanantoniogov.historic/Districts/Ursuline_Academy.aspx14 June 2012The question(s) for today is --Have you ever bought a book, started reading it and then realized you have already read it?  If so, how far did you get?

In any event, the cookbook looks like it is going to be very handy because I would rather have a pantry full of raw ingredients to make several things out of rather than buying a bunch of individual, processed foods. Then, there were these two magazines.  They are gorgeous, big, glossy and, while I am used to paying double digit prices for foreign cross stitch magazines,  not so much for domestic ones, even special editions like these.  So, the FrugalMelissa presents herself in my head and says \"wait a minute, that is almost $30 for two magazines -- TWO MAGAZINES\".  So,  I back off, put them away and came home to reconsider.  They each have a number  of really cute projects that I can see me doing so it might not be a bad purchase but I may have to look for another, cheaper source, possibly used.  I am still thinking about them so it is possible that at least one of them will end up in my ever growing magazine stash.  You know, the one that multiplies itself in the night.  Yep, that one.So, those are my Friday Finds -- quite a varied list, I would say.  Hope this review is helpful!"},

It was a mess from the beginning which we just made worse by trying to \"improve it\".  So, after all the bushes were out, Hubs took to the rock path and made it more structured than it was originallyAfter much ripping out, rearranging, mulching and agonizing over moving rocks and the pain after moving the rocks this is what he had --We were then left with this little curvy piece of real estate and were dead set on putting mondo grass in it only to learn that mondo grass isn't going to grow in that perpetually sunny location so we ended up with this...It is dianthus and has a lovely little red flower on it.  We aren't done as we want to add a piece of  \"something\" to add interest and we are going to have to remove a bush that didn't make a transplant but all in all, that is the front flower bed and we are quite happy to be rid of the giant shrubbery!So, that is my view from the....driveway!AAARRRRRGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I have written a perfectly lovely post which is now in draft because my photos are all wonky!

Yes, I can.  Online from  a website that sells products made by Old Order Mennonite women. Are you kidding me?Another thing in question is toys.  In the recent past there was a influx of lead laden toys imported to the US.  These toys posed a health hazard to our children so I went looking for American made toys.  Yeah -- not so much.  I will admit that my children were little during the age of toy excess -- the 80's and that the choices were seemingly endless.  However, now, it is different.  I was searching, online of course, for a doll stroller.  I found many, mostly imports, that looked frighteningly like the real thing.  I can see little children thinking these items are real and not toys, attempting to get into them and getting hurt.  They are all metal and pretty flimsy at that -- dangerous at best.I have been looking for things for myself as well.  Shoes to fit my wide feet.  You can't just go to a department store and buy wide shoes, you have to order them.  As a result, I have to buy my shoes from places like Zappos and Online Shoes.  No wonder I don't like to go shopping.  After looking to replace some garments that I particularly like with the same thing, I discovered that while they can be purchased online, they can't be purchased in the store. It seems like our choices are getting fewer and costing us more in the way of shipping fees.  A clever plan by retailers to get more of our money for less?  I think probably so.  The list goes on and on.  When I was growing up, my mother grocery shopped every two weeks at one store.  She didn't run all over town because she couldn't get what she wanted at the store she patronized.  Can I do that?  Heck, no! I have to divide my time between four stores just to buy groceries for the two of us.  No one store stocks everything I need.  What a pain.I have no solution, just needed to vent a bit here.  I think I heard someplace the other day that the US is thinking it would be a good idea to bring some of the manufacturing business back here.  Very clever -- think we could start with little girl's slips?"},

Well, after years and years of digging for my roots, collaborating with other relatives and strangers and through the magic of Ancestry.com's networking abilities, I pretty much know where I come from even though much of it is undocumentable.  I have even, recently, put together the story behind the elusive \"American Indian grandmother\" which, by the way, is true, she is, we are and I have photos. However, the one story that has been in question all these years is whether or not my father comes from Jewish ancestry.  My grandfather was firm in his beliefs that it is a fact.  I have talked with others on message boards that say they grew up with the same story.  None of my family is Jewish religiously.  In fact, my father's family is deeply entrenched in the Primitive Baptist church with many church builders and leaders among the ranks.  However, the story persists and, if you go by visual evidence in the faces of my forefathers, it bears more investigation. So, that question alone has prompted me to do the test along with the fact that advanced technology now allows both Y-DNA and mitochondrial DNA testing to be done on women.  The last male in my fathers line passed away in November so there are no more boys to test for that line -- sad, isn't it?  I figured that Y-DNA testing was lost to me until I read about the Ancestry program and am now really excited.  The cost is reasonable for this test considering that it will reveal so much more information and I anxious to learn my \"ethnicity\" as they put it. Of course, I expect the majority of my roots to be in the British Isles -- nothing new here.  One stray German grandmother will pop up I am sure and I won't be surprised if the American Indian grandmother shows herself as well.  What I will be keeping a close eye out for, however, is my father's family which, until recently, has been very elusive what with different name spellings and common given names -- searching for them has been a challenge and I am hoping that this will help clear up a few questions that my family has asked for years.I ordered the test this morning, it is on back order, and it will take 4-6 weeks to get the results once they get the sample.  I will report the findings here -- I wonder what sort of surprises are in store -- kinda scary!"},

This book does a really good job of depicting the role of women in 15th century England and you wouldn't want to be there -- really.  It was a particularly brutal time and women had to endure a lot of things from their children being taken from them, being widowed at an early age -- sometimes before the age of 20, being assigned to husbands or guardians, and living in the knowledge that their primary purpose is bearing children regardless of the circumstances.This book is well written, readable, and accurate and I would recommend it to anyone interested in British history."},

I have also been thinking about how the  sewing pattern companies are really stingy.  Have you priced sewing patterns lately?  Outrageous.  Plus, they print multiple sizes on one pattern which means you either cut a bunch of the sizes away or you have to do a lot of extra work tracing the pattern onto the material all for the tidy sum of at least $12, without a coupon. So, you get a lot less paper for a lot more money and I don't think that is ok.  For what they cost, I think we should get lots and lots of paper.I have also been thinking about how items that we used to have have just completely disappeared.  Has anybody else, who had children in the 80's, noticed how few toys are available now?

Pink and white flannel -- soon to be winter pajamas in summer.  Cutting, stitching, dreaming of pink buttons but accepting sticky tape instead.  An anchor?  Maybe an initial?  Whatever it will be, it will be navy. A drive north, my mind jumping from one thing to another -- trying to keep the fears at bay, the sadness in its little box where I keep it.  How did that car get upside down on a side street?  The things you see on an ordinary afternoon!

He passed away when I was six and I missed him.  However, after I was an adult I re-established a relationship with that side of my family and I didn't mourn the people who passed on  as much as  the time I missed with them.  In November I suddenly lost a dear cousin from this family  and again I was reminded how much time was lost over irrelevant \"things\".Today I learned that my mother's baby brother passed away last Wednesday.  In addition to her brother, my mother had two sisters, both now gone.  Between them all there were five of us girls -- all stair stepped in age except for the last one who was ten years younger than me.  There was a point when I was close to the three older ones.  We would go to movies, have sleepovers, go to dances, go to each other's graduations, we were in each others weddings -- we had a close relationship.  Then, something happened and the relationship changed.  I am close enough to my eldest cousin to consider her a sister.  The other two, the daughters of my late uncle, are like strangers.  I don't  know why, I wish I did, I wish we could fix things.  So, when I think about the passing of my uncle, while I am sad for the loss of the last of my mother's siblings, I am even sadder at the loss of the family that remains. I guess it is a sign of age that I can remember well the relationships and how it felt to lose them but can't seem to recall the reason why the change occurred.  I guess, as I age,  I just can't get my head around how childish situations of the past could be more important than family.  It is a shame we have to wait until we get to a \"certain\" age to see priorities clearly.Wow, what a depressing post but it has been that sort of day."},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, April 21, 2012", "text": "Bringing up Bebe -- Pamela DruckermanYes, I know, I am too old to have much interest in child rearing.  I did my job, good or bad, and I have to say I raised two really good, really smart people in spite of myself.  Did I make mistakes -- oh yeah.  Being an only child with a very nervous mother put me at a huge disadvantage in this area.  I wasn't around children much so when they handed me my first little bundle of joy a panic ensued that can actually still be seen today.  We didn't have many books back in the mid-70's, I think I had a copy of a Better Homes and Garden's baby care book that showed me how to take temperature.  I did learn, however, through trial and error and now, at my advanced age, I can see clearly where I should have done a few things differently but the kids are fine and I am relatively calm unless the phone rings at an unusual time.While I am not in charge of any more short charges, I am actively involved in babysitting one small future adult.  When this book was mentioned in conversation, I thought I would check it out so a week or so ago, when I was locked out of my neighborhood due to the Komen Race for the Cure, I spent a bit of quality time with my Nook at Barnes and Noble.  A lovely hot chocolate and a rather sad coconut macaroon was involved but I can't talk about that -- what a waste of $1.95.As I sat down with my little indulgence I opened up the book on my Nook (you can read for free for an hour if you are in a store) and started checking out \"Bringing up Bebe\" by Pamela Druckerman.  This is a book about a 30-something American woman married to a British man and they have a 18 month old girl-child fondly referred to as Bean (she does have a proper name, the author assures.) They are living in Paris. As I have a 30-something American daughter married to a British man with a 22 month old daughter called Bean, all living in the US,  I felt I needed to read the book.  It got me from the first page.This is not a guide for raising a baby with a lot of clinical information.  It is a comparison of parenting styles in France contrasted to parenting styles in the US.  The author, living in Paris where there American and British ex-pats are not unusual, begins to notice a difference in the behavior of the children in social situations.  The French children seem to be calmer and more able to do without their parents attention for reasonable periods of time.  This behavior was especially noticeable in restaurants and the playground.  After making this observation on a number of occasions, Druckerman decides to research the French children's behavior to see what makes the difference.  As I read on, it seemed to me that it was less a study of the differences in the children (there really weren't any) and more a study of the differences in the reactions of the French and American/British parents to the children's behaviors.  The main focus of the book is \"the cadre\" -- or framework of parenting.  There are set rules that are not broken, the French are very strict about this, but within that framework there is a great deal of freedom which, they believe, allows the children to blossom.There were some concepts in the French parenting style that I agreed with completely.  Their emphasis on food and eating was, in my opinion, one of the healthiest I have ever heard of but I still can't get my head around two pieces of French baguette with a chocolate bar in the middle -- that doesn't sound good  even to me.  They don't believe in snacking and the observation is that French women don't walk around with little ziplock bags of pretzels and cheerios in their designer bags.  They believe that children should be required to taste everything on their plate but they don't have to eat it if they don't want it.  It is the general concensus that children can handle more sophisticated tastes at an early age and they are fed accordingly.  They eat the same as the parents every day with the food being chopped or pureed according to age.The other main consideration is sleep.  Naps aren't really part of the conversation but bedtime is.  Bedtime is rigorously enforced and that is something I can completely agree with because it helps nurture the other thing that is prominent in French parenting -- The Couple.  The French believe that not letting having children interfere in the parents relationship is a priority.  That sounds negative but it isn't -- they just feel like having the parents relationship stay strong is as important to the children as it  is to the parents.Another main point that I can agree with is treating children with respect and listening to them, taking their thoughts into consideration, the whole time retaining the concept that the adult is in charge.  I wish I had had a better working knowledge of this concept when I was raising mine.There are a number of things that I don't think would work here in the US or that don't personally agree with.  I can't imagine one child going snackless in a world of little ziplock bags.  Not that the child wouldn't be better off, mind you, but I can just imagine the tears, chaos, and possibly even hostility in the playgroup.I am not a fan of sending a four year old off to some camp someplace for several days at a time without a supervising parent.  That just wouldn't fly in this house.  The only camp my kids ever went to was Camp MeeMaw and yes, for the record, I am sure they felt terribly deprived -- at least one of them does.  However, that is the mood in the US -- to ensure your child's safety which doesn't seem to be a priority in French parenting -- at least they don't seem to be quite so neurotic about it.  Could we lighten up?  Probably.  Will we?  Probably not.And then there is the question of those chocolate bar sandwiches.  I just don't get that -- it must be a cultural thing!I would recommend this book to any person who is or ever has been involved in raising children.  It is an eye opening, thought provoking tome that makes me wish I could go back and do some things over again with this more \"worldly\" view of things.  However, we are in Texas, not France, and I just don't think it is a concept that can be fully embraced here."},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, April 09, 2012", "text": "And this one time -- in Home EcMany years ago, in about 1963, I took Home Ec at Mark Twain Junior High School in San Antonio, Texas.  It was not a happy  time for anybody.  The classes were divided up and for one semester we took cooking and the other semester we took sewing.The \"kitchen\" class room was really sort of cute  -- very 1940's with four \"kitchens\",  each with a sink, cabinets, chrome tables with four chairs and a stove.  There was a professional refrigerator for use by everybody.  Each \"kitchen\" had dishes and supplies.  Sounds like fun, right?  For me, not so much.  We had four kitchen mates and we would rotate duties on a weekly basis.  I was fine with everything except lighting the oven.  It was a gas oven that I am sure was there when my mother attended the same school.  I would almost have anxiety attacks when I had to light the thing, with a match, so I made a deal with my friend Anne that she would light the stove when it was my turn and I would do whatever she was scheduled for.  As a result, I grew up really disliking cooking.  The teacher was a hoot, though, and she was also there when my mother was there, right along with the stove -- but that is another blog!You  probably can't imagine anything worse than 16 weeks of misery in a kitchen you were afraid of but there was something worse -- the sewing room.  I didn't know much about sewing except what I learned watching my mother sew but I did recognize that the machines were old -- probably purchased when the stoves were -- and that the little, pleasant looking teacher was really a  SewingNazi! We actually had to sew real clothes -- a blouse and a skirt.  There was a pattern for the blouse that we bought from the teacher and the skirt was a gathered skirt that we just took measurements and sewed.  I got through the blouse ok and we started on the skirt.  Mine was made from some lovely yellow polished cotton fabric with white polka dots. I did a miserable job. The teacher got so mad at me she ripped it up, threw it at me and told me to take it home and do it over.  My mother wasn't happy, to say the least.  I won't repeat what she said but I remember it well -- let's just say that my little Mama turned into the MotherNazi.  She remade the skirt, sent it back to school with me along with a message and the teacher never said so much as \"boo\" to me ever again.  And, for years, that ended any desire I had to sew anything -- at all.Then there was geometry.  Let it just suffice to say I am mathematically dysfunctional so I chose to take plane geometry during summer school.  I thought it would be better to ruin half a summer than a whole school year and I was right.  The good thing was I got to see one of my best friends from 9th grade, Delphine, who went on to a different high school.  The bad thing was we all had to take gamma globulin because Lois had mononucleosis! I got through it but I am not sure how.So, where is all this back story going?  Well, you wouldn't expect me to pour over cooking magazines, collect cookbooks or quilt, right?  Well, I do.  Anybody who has read this blog for a while knows that I have been quilting for years and have figured out ways to deal with all that geometry.  I spent a long time sewing clothes for myself after  high school -- I liked making dresses and skirts on occasion and I really enjoyed sewing  clothes for my kids and oddly, I sewed more for my son than my daughter! However, I always had an interest in quilting and finally gave up garment sewing for quilting.  I have done a lot of it but now I have had the opportunity to do a bit of sewing for my granddaughter.I have been away from my blog for the last few weeks sewing a couple of things for the Bean.  Not having bought a children's pattern in YEARS, I had to try a couple of things before I got it right but I finally hit on the correct size and managed to produce a reasonable Easter dress for our baby Bean.  My daughter is very, VERY picky and very, VERY preppy -- her middle name should have been Lilly Pulitzer! So, I was really pleased, and relieved, when she thought the dress was perfect.  So, here it is!And here is the sweet Bean modeling it!This was taken right after the Easter egg hunt at church yesterday -- she made quite a haul and even shared with a friend! Oh, and about the stoves.  About ten years after the disaster sewing/cooking year, I was working as an administrative secretary for the school district that I attended school in.  Late one afternoon we got a call that there was a fire at Twain -- one of the stoves had exploded.  This didn't surprise me.  Not one bit."},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, March 26, 2012", "text": "Love/HateI am really having a love/hate relationship with a number of things right now.  The most predominate is beautiful spring versus vicious allergies.  Truthfully, the weather we are having now is really our summer because, come June, weather here in Texas can turn from summer to Hades in a flash which means we are housebound for weeks.  Last year we had 100+ temps almost all summer which made me sad that we didn't take advantage of the beautiful early spring we had -- who knew?  This year, remembering last year, we are trying to make the most of spring but wouldn't you know, this is the worst pollen season on record -- EVER! So, what is a person to do -- options -- take meds all the time and go outside or take meds some of the time and never go out.  We are being attacked just walking to the car or into a store -- it is pretty miserable and I am not sure that any of the options are great.Then, there is the love/hate relationship with computers in general.  I have a little netbook as well as a desk top with enough power/memory to man another country.  However, I like the little netbook which allows me to sit and surf in front of the tv which is probably the least healthy thing in the world.  Anyway, the little netbook needed a new battery which we ordered and installed -- not rocket science -- and now it doesn't want to talk to the wireless router.  I am not such which has gone silent but it doesn't matter -- it is causing me much sadness and a little stress to not be able to do my unhealthy thing.Then there is Facebook.  I joined FB when it was brand new, didn't know what to do with it and nobody else was on it.  Same with Twitter which I still don't understand.  I had a myspace account as well and was reasonably comfortable with that for social networking but I relied on email (and actually, the telephone) more.  The great exodus to FB commenced and myspace became a dinosaur as did my email, apparently.  Nobody emails me anymore.  I have over 3000 emails in my inbox and 99% of them are ads relating to online searches.  I rarely get emails from people anymore.  I also started blogging a long time ago, switched from blogspot to wordpress a couple of times before finally settling on blogspot, started reading other's blogs which is one of my favorite pastimes on the netbook but even that gets pushed aside for FB.  I have decided that FB is good but getting less so as time goes on  -- the most recent revelation is that of FB declaring that it owns the word \"book\".  Whatever.  I would get off the FB treadmill but the truth is, that is the only way I keep up with anybody anymore.  It is really sad.  I remember people saying how bad it is that with the advent of modern technology from the telephone on down, interpersonal communication has dwindled to nothing.  People don't write anymore, in cursive or otherwise, they don't even talk on the phone anymore, they text -- a phenomenon that is keeping teenagers from having face to face conversations.  People wonder what is happening to our society with everything from obesity to drug/alcohol abuse, physical abuse, depression, etc.  Could it be people are lonely?  I live in a house in a garden home community where the houses are very close together yet we could all be on islands because the houses are built for extreme privacy and honestly, we never see our neighbors.  Could it be that we really need that face to face, over the back fence, chat?  Could it be we really need the phone call or the handwritten note?  Personally, I think we do.  I just don't think we can sustain ourselves as human beings with other human beings being replaced by technology.  If you ask the younger generation I am sure you would get a completely different answer but for those of us who grew up in a different place and time, all this technology has the potential for a love/hate situation. When I first dipped my little toe into the computer/internet world, I was fascinated.  I would spend hours on the internet but over the course of time I have found that, while the instant gratification of instant information is very compelling, it is also very overwhelming.  I am finding myself going back to reading the newspaper and listening to the radio.  I have three e-readers yet I still carry a paperback in my purse and love the feel of a nice, hardback with the dust jacket in place to mark my place.  I went into the library a few days back to renew my card and was taken back to my days at the San Pedro Public Library where I had a favorite corner and my goal was to read every book in that corner -- all my favorite authors.  I have also discovered that my favorite sound is silence -- and I don't mean Simon and Garfunkel.I guess I you could say that I am in generational limbo -- but haven't all previous generations been in the same predicament?  New technology all the time for eons, yet now, this new wave of technology, seems to be more menacing to our well-being than, let's say, the electric light bulb.  I am sure, back then, people complained about that too but I just feel like what we have now, while wonderful on so many levels, is maybe just a little too advanced.With that said, hee hee, I just downloaded a gadget to my homepage that allows me to send texts to phones from my computer! Now all I have to worry about is how invasive that is, how dangerous to my privacy that is and how addictive that could be.  Oh dear -- I guess I am still \"finding\" myself. Have a great Monday!"},

It came early this year after virtually no winter but I am ok with that -- spring and autumn are my favorite seasons, after all, with October and April being my favorite months.  That info sort of falls into the random category of my title.  So, here are the photos for this week.The Hubs did a good deal of work in the garden a couple of days ago and I have more photos of the verbena that seems to be on steroids along with the hyperactive mint.  I will post those soon.In other news, the girl that has been doing my hair for a long time has had a beautiful baby boy and decided to take off for a while -- can't say as I blame her.  However, it left me looking for a new person to cut my hair.  I had options and I think I took the right one.  The new girl listened carefully and did exactly as I asked and I am thrilled.  I took the plunge and I am a little closer to Judi Dench than I was before but I am so happy with the way it looks and feels -- I almost don't mind being gray.  Well, I guess I don't really mind at all because if I did I would do something about it but, you get the picture.  So, that was my big news this week.I have been doing a bit of sewing this week as it is spring break and my teacher daughter is home with the Bean and I am left to my own devices.  I have been doing some rearranging of my sewing things and doubt I will ever , ever get the space right but I have been working toward getting some unfinished projects done, some new ones started and look forward to using up some of my stash so that I can reduce my crafting footprint!  I like sewing/quilting/stitching/crafting but my one little area for all those activities just can't hold anymore supplies so I need to use up before I buy more.I am in the market for a new bedspread.  I have been dealing with dust ruffle/comforter/pillow sham combo for years and just have a huge dislike for pillow shams.  The Hubs HAS to have his pillow covered at all times so there is no casual stacking of multiple pillows for the cushy look so I am looking for a bedspread that will cover the pillows when made up -- really old school and not so easy to find.  I have been checking out the offerings at Bates Mill Store and even called for swatches.  I have chosen a couple of styles to pick from and narrowed the color down but for the life of me I think that they are too expensive.  Now granted, they are made in the USA which, for me, is a plus --- I like to buy domestic when I can and they are preshrunk which is another plus as I have been known to shrink things in the dryer from time to time.  My other option is to make a quilt myself which I keep thinking about but I have a king size bed and that just seems to be a lot of work and no instant gratification.  So.....decisions, decisions, decisions......I am reading \"The Red Queen\" by Philippa Gregory and it is really good.  It is one that I received for my birthday and I am really enjoying it.  I am about halfway done and will review when I am finished.So, that is about all I have been up to -- no shopping, no cooking, nothing of any excitement at all.  I will see if I can remedy that over the weekend!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, March 07, 2012", "text": "The School of Essential IngredientsWhen I was about fifteen years old, I attended school in an old school in a historic part of town.  You know the sort of area, houses built with at least a 200 year lifespan by the influential leaders of the city with each house being different from the next -- no two houses alike.  I used to sit in \"study hall\" in the library gazing at these houses through large, multi-paned windows.  On the days when I didn't have homework to do I would pick out a house and create a story in my mind about the family that lived in it.  Now, granted, I knew some of the families that lived in some of those houses so I just skipped over those.  I chose the ones I knew nothing about.  That is what this book reminded me of -- a whole book full of little stories about individual people.The first story is about Lillian, the owner of a restaurant who also gives cooking classes on Monday, in the evening.  It begins in  her childhood and ends with her \"present\".  Each chapter concerns itself with a member of her current cooking class.  Each character has a story and each is very realistic, I am sure all readers could identify with one or two, if not all of them.  As these characters participate in the cooking class, their lives become intertwined and blended just like the food they create.Then, that brings us to the food.  The way the author approaches the food is the way almost anybody who is serious about cooking as an art form approaches the food.  She relates the food to the people, she depicts food as an essential part of relationships as much as a necessity of life.  Honestly, the way Bauermeister writes about the food makes you want to sign up for a cooking class because it is so much more than following a recipe -- it is following an instinct.This is Bauermeister's first novel.  I don't know how she is going to out do herself.  This is a beautifully written book.  The settings are so well described that all you have to do is close yours eyes and you are there.  You can taste the food, you can feel the pain and joy and sorrow and love that all the characters exude.   It is a fantastic book. I recommend this book with one reservation -- don't read it unless you have already eaten!From Jake at Junkboat Travelsand wouldn't it be fantastic to have a bookstore such as this somewhere close -- like just down the road within walking distance with a coffee/tea shop near? If only Fort Worth was supportive of independent business like Austin is -- I could see running a little shop --- with coffee and tables and maybe even a little dog.  I can see all sorts of possibilities if the environment were right which it is not.  Oh well, I can dream, can't I?"},

I watched this movie one afternoon by myself and thought the sets and the setting were wonderful.  If you haven't seen the movie, I won't spoil it here but the basic story line is that of two women teachers running a private school for girls in their home.  One of the girls, a complete brat, started a rumor that the relationship between the teachers was not appropriate and as a result the school suffered as did the lives of all the characters.  I won't say more, just watch it.Tonight I talked the Hubs into watching another vintage film that I think I actually did see but I guess my parents thought I was too young to understand and I probably was but I found it boring now so I would guess I slept through it then, as well.  Tonight's film was \"Room at the Top\" with Laurence Harvey and Simone Signoret.   It was made in 1959 and was part of the British New Wave of films coming to America.  It was a good movie but it was slow -- I guess I am just used to the action adventure movies The Hubs likes to watch --- this movie was sort of like watching paint dry.  All month on TCM there with be more British New Wave movies on -- maybe I can catch a couple of them.So, that is about all I have been up to.  Hopefully I can be a little better at blogging but sometimes -- for those who know me this statement will be difficult to grasp -- I just don't have anything to say! Guess I need to do some more interesting things -- I will work on that tomorrow."},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, February 25, 2012", "text": "Catching Up and a Couple of Book ReviewsI am still playing catch up after my two week babysitting gig.  I did ok the first week but the second week found me a bit tired toward the end.  It would be fine if there wasn't so much getting up and down off the floor.  Now that Bean is pushing two, however, there isn't nearly as much lifting which is a blessing and considering that she is the independent sort, she does a lot for herself.  Aside from having the opportunity to spend time with Bean, the time I spend at her house does afford me a good amount of time to read which I really enjoy.  She still takes a good afternoon nap so I have at least two hours of uninterrupted time to get into a really good book.  I have  been able to finish or almost finish a couple of really good reads in a short amount of time -- for me -- this way.The  first book I finished was The House at Tyneford by Natasha Solomons. I discovered it when I did a search on Downton Abbey and several complementary books were recommended.  It is the story of a young Dutch Jewess who was shipped off to England at the beginning of World War Two to work as a domestic in a big house, even though she was somewhat aristocratic in her own right.  She was dispatched to Tyneford house where she learned all the ins and outs of British aristocracy.  She also learned of love, loss -- great loss, and of starting over again and having strong resolve.  This book was a page turner, I couldn't put it down and would recommend it to anyone.The second book I have been reading, and am about to finish is The Forgotten Garden by Kate Morton.This book presents more of a challenge than the first.  It is longer and much more detailed as it presents the story of three interconnected women.  Each chapter is devoted to one of the three women's story and you have to pay close attention to the intertwining of these stories -- one from Victorian England, one from mid-twentieth century Australia and one from current Australia/England.  Through part of the beginning of the book, when so much historical foundation was being laid, I felt as if I should take notes!  However, as I am nearing the end of the book, it is all pulling together nicely, making sense, and making me sorry that the end is so near.  To make a complicated story shorter, it is about three abandonments, so to speak -- Eliza who was orphaned by death, Nell who was kidnapped, and Cassandra who was left with Grandma by a self-absorbed Mum who was needing to find herself and have fun while she was at it.  In addition to all these women being related that would be the common link.  It, too, is a page turner -- some of those turns going backward to re-read sections. I can't wait to get back to it today and finish is up although I am sure I am going to be sad when it is done.  I will probably have to seek out a copy of another Morton book -- The House at Riverton.  I am certain it will be as captivating. I would recommend  The Forgotten Garden hands down with one reservation -- it might make you want to create a magical secret garden -- I know it has made me want to work in my yard!Another activity this week, unrelated to babysitting or reading, was Shrove Tuesday, Pancake Day, or Fat Tuesday -- whatever way you want to say it.  This was actually the first time we ever attended because, in the past, The Hubs was always at work at the time most of our church events begin but, clearly, this year was different.  So, we decided to join Bean and her folks  in the festivities.  The parish hall was decorated in the usual gold/green/purple and there were beads abounding -- all anybody had to do was grab them  off the table.  Bean looked lovely in green -- really went with the red hair.  There were literally piles and piles of pancakes and waffles, bacon  and sausage and bowls of fresh strawberries.  Whipped cream and maple syrup completed the buffet table along with milk, tea and water.  It was a feast, for sure, and none of us took a camera.  You would think that at my age I would realize that every day has its Kodak moments and carry a camera with me at all times!  I will work on that and in the meantime, I will see if I can \"steal\" one from the good Father Klein off the church website.So, all of this coupled with beautiful spring weather (almost 80 a couple of days-- makes me fear for July) it has been a fantastic week with another just like it on the way!  I may get out and work in that garden yet -- I just need a gate!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, February 13, 2012", "text": "QuiltingMy first exposure to quilting was when I was about four or five years old at the side of my great-grandmother.  I remember the evening well.  My mother and I were visiting her at her house on Edison Drive -- an old, white Victorian with a turnkey door bell which I loved, much to everybody's aggravation.  She was born in 1875 so she was close to 80 at this time.  We sat in her living room waiting for my dad to get off work and she and my grandmother were piecing a quilt top.  They weren't using a sewing machine -- although she did have a lovely treadle model -- they were using a needle and thread as they sat and rocked and talked.  The fabrics they used weren't  co-ordinated lines they purchased at their local quilt store -- they were scraps from sewing and old clothes.  They were making utility quilt tops to be put aside and quilted out when somebody said they needed some cover.  I was fascinated with the fabric and the process and even tried my hand at it that evening.  Although I didn't start quilting until much later, the fascination stayed with me as did my love of fabrics.  So, when I started quilting, I started with a sewing machine and modern tools although I did hand quilt my first quilt.  I love most of the process and the instant gratification of being able to get a quilt finished in as little as a weekend was certainly appealing.  A few years ago I purchased a fancy new quilting edition machine that has all the bells and whistles.  It is great but....it is in the laundry room so if I want to sew in the evening that means I am in the laundry room and Hubs is in front of the tv.  Not a good scenario so I decided to revisit the idea of hand piecing.A year or so ago I decided I wanted to try some English paper piecing, a common pattern being Grandmother's Flower Garden.  I downloaded the page of paper templates from an online site and started cutting out hundreds of little hexagons and making little fabric hexies.I sat down one evening and started sewing and couldn't believe how quickly you can make millions of these little things.  Then I decided I needed to see how easily they go together and I made a few of those (bottom photo).  I am going to applique them onto squares for a baby quilt after a get a few more.  I think they are so cute!Of course, doing everything by machine these days is the way \"it is done\" but recently, however, I have noticed in the quilting magazines that there seems to be a trend toward handwork again so I decided to try it.  I wanted to buy the Marti Mitchell templates but I couldn't find them locally and they were pretty pricey so I opted for the Omnigrid 3\" square template set which has a square, a half square triangle and a quarter square triangle template.  They are heavy acrylic with the seam allowance already included.  I also bought a quarter inch ruler to mark my sewing lines.  I put the whole thing aside for a week or so until the other night I decided to give it a go.  I fished around in one of my many drawers of fabric and found some pre-cuts that I wasn't in love with -- not sure why I bought them except to maybe have some experimental fabric -- you don't really want to experiment with quilt store fabric -- that stuff is like gold.  Anyway, I did a bit of marking with a plain ol' mechanical pencil, did a bit of cutting and a little bit of stitching and this is the result.  This may end up being my first real scrap quilt!front of some really random fabrics sewn into four patchesbacks of same four patchesFront of quarter square trianglesBacks of quarter square triangles -- clearly not ironed yetSo, that is what I have been up to the last few days -- I even opted to do this rather than look at the snow last night! This is truly addictive and very relaxing.  I might never get a quilt finished but at least it is cheaper than therapy!"},

No, I am not gone -- I just have a week long babysitting gig.  And you know, there are some things you get too old for.  I have been in bed, out like a light, at 9:30 every night since last week!  Oh well, it feels good.  Dinner out -- who knew there were so many plant based choices in restaurants -- and home to a warm bed -- nothing to complain about there!Speaking of plant based -- going well, it is.  I did eat a little meat over the weekend and, oddly, it didn't even taste good so I didn't end up on one of those craving binges.  I haven't craved sweets either so it is working for me.  I have dropped about 5 pounds, or maybe 6 which is a great  added  benefit.  The only thing is, my already low blood pressure is even lower now which I am not sure is so great but I feel ok so I am just going to watch it.So, ok, was just checking in and now I am checking out -- gotta hit the road and see you later!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, January 30, 2012", "text": "Battling Demons -- Faith Based PostI am a Christian believer.  I always have been.  I believe in the power of prayer.  I believe that I am never alone and am being watched over even when I am struggling -- especially when I am struggling.  The thing that I am not, however, is a good listener.  I am not talking about listening to my hubby or my children or my grandchildren, I am talking about listening to God.  Maybe I don't sit still long enough, maybe I am not quiet enough, maybe I am just looking for somebody else to fix my problems. However, this weekend, something changed.  I think God must have been screaming at me because I finally heard the answer to all the prayers, begging, and pleading of late.  I don't \"think\" I heard it, I know I heard it.  This has happened before so I know what it feels and sounds like. For a while now, by \"while\" I mean about five or six years, I have been battling several demons and they all seem to circle one central theme -- my health and my weight.  In the course of that time I have had heart palpitations, some bouts of what I feel are afib, anxiety, depression, low self esteem (ok, this has been all my life) and severe allergies. It all pretty much began when my parents got sick, I nursed them and then they died -- I am only child -- very traumatic.  Then, it all got significantly worse when my husband had quadruple bypass surgery in 2005.  He got well, I got sick.  Top this all off by the fact that I have a horrible phobia about doctors due to my parents experiences and you have a pretty miserable person. So, as per my usual method of operation, I went to God in prayer first and, as usual, didn't listen.  I figured I could take a supplement -- lots of them, in fact -- and somehow override the copious amounts of trash I was eating and somehow be saved.  Well, I couldn't even take the supplements on a regular basis but I could devour tons of sweets and soda and just junk on a regular basis  with no problem.  I sit and wonder why my hair is falling out, why my fingernails peel off, why my joints ache constantly, why I have no energy, why my heart flops around erratically from time to time.  So, the other evening, as I am want to do, I was surfing around the internet researching \"symptoms\" and found a few things that quite honestly, scared the life out of me.  (WebMD is evil, I have decided).  But, somewhere in my reading there was a voice in my head -- yes, an audible male voice -- that said \"plant based\".  As I read on in whatever it was I was reading, it said how many symptoms or ailments could be treated and, sometimes, even reversed by being vegan or vegetarian.   Now I have tried this before with absolutely no conviction and, clearly, no success but somehow I was compelled to read on.I prayed. I said that, as always, God's will prevailed but if it was his will that I get better just show me the way -- again, \"plant based\".  Had I heard this before and just not listened?  Probably.  So, the next evening Hubs and I went to Zoe's -- a health related restaurant new to the area and I had some lovely soup and slaw -- neither vegetarian but clearly more \"plant based\" than the cookies I usually eat.  We then went to the bookstore across the street and I walked straight to -- as if being led by the hand -- to this bookI came home, read the book -- not in its entirety as yet -- there is a ton of information -- and I decided I could do this.  Why?  Well, \"plant based\" was still booming in my head and I was kinda tired of being yelled at and I figured I could do it because there are large amounts of food involved.  Whole foods, mostly raw, and the promise that the cravings would be gone and I would not be hungry.  I mean, there is something compelling to be said about eating all you want of something, even if it is kale.  I don't like kale but I am going to give it a go again.So, I began on Friday.  According to Fuhrman salad --  and a lot of it -- is your main dish for lunch and supper and you should eat a cup of beans a day.  This is not a problem for me as I love that sort of food.  Hubs looked at me as I sat down to these meals -- he laughed.  He also said he was going to read the chapter on diabetes.  After eating these meals I had the oddest sensation.  I was full -- trust me -- I was full but.....I didn't have that feeling that I couldn't walk across the floor.  I felt light.  I haven't felt like this in .....well, I don't know that I have ever felt like this.  I feel \"clean\".  Now I know the meaning behind one of my favorite magazines about clean eating. I get it -- I GET IT!!! I feel like I am one of those people you hear about -- overweight yet starving to death.  I get it.  I listened.  Do I think that I was given a divine directive?  You betcha! And, when I get that sort of directive, I pay attention -- I am just sorry that I have been a defiant child -- I could have been doing this a long time ago.I have been exercising as well.  I have one of those Tony Little Gazelle things that are supposed to be gentle on your knees -- well, maybe if you are IronMan but me, yeah, not so much.  But, thirty minutes a day -- thirty five today.  I am not going to try to kill myself but stay consistent.  Another thing that helps -- I am accountable to my daughter.  I am not writing any of this down but I am reporting to her what I am eating and how I am feeling.  A support group is important.  I think she is giving consideration for herself what I am doing.  Hubs even said he was going to read the chapter on diabetes.  Now, THAT is a breakthrough!I figure after possibly six months to a year of this I will be able to say that some of my \"issues\" have left me.  I am hoping so, anyway.  I can't imagine that this life plan will be detrimental as I have been led here by the One who loves me the most and has never left me. So, I am back with a new vision and a new goal -- to be healthy so I can get on with what I need to get on with because I am pretty sure that I still have purpose and need to be able to fulfill that purpose.So, as an appropriate project to go along with this stage in my life I am stitching thisI think it is adorable -- more difficult than it looks -- and is sort of representative of my \"demons\".  When I am done I am hanging it where I can see it on a daily basis to remember to stay vigilant in battling my demons.  It also helps that I am of Welsh ancestry and I just love little dragons!"},

Nothing was dragging on my poor, arthritic shoulders and I felt liberated.  And....drumroll, please....it was on sale!If you are interested in looking at the manufacturers website, it is a Sherpani and the style is Luna.  They have several styles and four or five different art work designs.  I have a feeling I am going to wear this one out.So, even though I broke my no-spend streak, at least it was on sale and it seems like it is going to work for me! Yay!View from a Window --Ok, the pics were taken late Thursday afternoon but I am just getting them posted.  Anyway, they don't look much different than the previous ones.Remarkably unchanged, right?  So, I will add a couple of pics of birds that the Hubs took.  He has the camera mounted onto the telescope and is actually taking some good bird photos. Looks really serene, doesn't it?  Yeah, not so much.  We have so many doves out there it looks like something out of Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds\" and we have a hawk that relieved us of one of our doves -- there is nothing but a mess of feathers all over the flower bed.  Hubs is enjoying feeding the birds even though they are becoming demanding little demons and can put away an entire feeder of seed in one day -- but I have to wonder if we are just setting them up to be somebody else's dinner?  Hubs says it is just nature -- I say it is creepy.  In any event,  this is the life in our backyard!"},

Maybe I won't have such a dismal showing in 2012!\"A Plain and Fancy Christmas\" is the second book I have read by Cynthia Keller.  I have read many Amish-related novels over the years, mostly by Beverly Lewis, but these by Cynthia Keller are a bit different.  In this book Rachel Yoder, a young mother born and raised into the Amish community, and  Ellie Lawrence, a young woman of the same age, born and raised in New York City, find themselves in a seemingly impossible situation, forever linked.  It all starts with a letter they both receive and their reactions to the letter and subsequent actions change both of their lives, and those of their families, forever -- and possibly for the better.I am not going to tell you the story because I don't want to spoil it but I will say that it is a page turner.  There is a small bit of mystery involved although it is dealt with, in its entirety at the beginning of the book so it isn't like you are waiting to get through the book to see \"whodunnit\".  You know from the beginning and, actually, then the real mystery begins.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Amish fiction.  I don't know why I do, but, I do.  Cynthia Keller, in both her books, use the plot to compare and contrast the Amish way of life to the English way of life and the good to be had from both.  In the end, each group learns something from the other -- they aren't one-sided and preachy -- they are good.  Try it!"},

A bit of trivia here, his wife lives here in Fort Worth.It was a good movie in spite of all the over-acting.  I have always loved westerns and this was always at the top of my list.  Maybe it is because I always thought Natallie Wood made a cute Indian!Happy New Year!I am wishing you all a Happy New Year this morning since I was out like a light at 9:30  pm. in a Benadryl fog! I finally got into bed at 10:22 p.m. and if there was any fun and frivolity to be had -- I was not a part of it.  Why you ask?  Well, between December and February I become like the walking dead  -- unable to hear, breathe, smell and barely talk -- yes, welcome relief for some, I know.  It is the season of Mountain Cedar here in Texas.  I was plagued with it my whole life in San Antonio and thought when I moved north I would be free of it -- upwind so to speak.  Yeah, not so much.  Thanks to the builders of the big, ugly condo behind me, it is worse this year because apparently they were able to buy hundreds of cedar trees at a great price and planted them all behind my house.  Yay!Here is the map from pollen.com and you will see what I mean.Doesn't it look like fun?  It will be this way through February and maybe by my birthday I will start to feel like a human again.  I wonder if I can sue the condo people for planting all these trees  after we talked to them about it.  Stellar folk they are.So, enough about that -- on with the rest of my new year.I am still reading the two books I started a few days ago -- \"Aunt Dimity's Christmas\" which I am almost finished with and \"A Plain and Fancy Christmas\" which I have just started.  I had planned to read both of them in December for Christmas but here I am, still reading and really quite over Christmas. I am going to try a new recipe I found in \"Fine Cooking\".  It is for chicken with lemons and oranges and roasted in a broth of juice and garlic.  I think it sounds wonderful  -- we will see what Hubs says.   I will have it with rice and some green veggie, maybe some carrots and a salad.  There isn't much to it and the only thing I am going to change about it is the cut of chicken.  I am going to use only white meat instead of chicken quarters as Hubs doesn't like dark meat.  If it is good, I will let you know.  If  not, well, you will be spared the details.So, on that note, I am off to undress a Christmas tree and get things back in order here so I can get rid of all the cedar dust that has undoubtedly blown into my house from the property behind me.  Chances are I will be in another Benadryl fog is a while and Mucinex is my new BFF. Have a wonderful day, all! Happy New Year!"},

I just love black and white movies and the first on my queue is \"Bunny Lake Is Missing\" -- a 1960 something psychological thriller.Reading is, of course, one of my main interests now and always has been.  I have joined two new reading challenges for the new year.  The two books I am reading now will, of course, count among those completed early in the year. I didn't do so well on my 2011 challenge but, in fairness to me, I did start later in the year.  I love to read and, unfortunately, it was neglected to a large degree for many years and now I plan to indulge my desire and need to pick up the pace again.My genealogical quest will be ramped up as will creating scrapbooks of the many boxes of photos we have.  I don't like \"scrapbooking\" as we know it today so mine are going to be more \"vintage\" -- black paper, photo corners and  photo descriptions written in white ink.  Even though I am definitely a 60's kind of gal, I really love all the trapping of the 40's -- just love it.My family is the most important thing to me.  I will spend time with them, as much as I can, and be a benefit to them as much as I can.  However, in looking back at A's and my \"middle years\" much of our time together was separated by his job, sometimes for months on end.  It was a difficult time and now we need to take the time to try to recapture some of that time for ourselves, whether it is on short road trips, gardening, cooking, or sitting here staring mindlessly at football -- it doesn't matter -- we just need time.The main thing that I will not be spending ANY time on is trying to be somebody other than who I am just to please other people.  I have served myself well for all these years and I think I like myself well enough to continue on.  That is not to say that I don't make mistakes -- I do -- or that I can't learn something -- I can but I will no longer worry about what other people think of me and I will not change one thing about myself to meet somebody elses expectations."},

It was laminated to insure that it lasts for a long, long time.The lovely stars from Nathan and Kathryn were crafted from a recipe of glue, water and cinnamon, similar to salt dough but probably not as rough on little hands.  They are dated and initialed and smell gorgeous.Over the years, JLSHall has been giving me Lenox ornaments and I have a nice little collection.  I love them, I love the feel of them and the colors.  This year I received this lovely tree.It is so sweet because each of the ornaments on the tree is a package and when you give it a shake they all tinkle! Again, it is a lovely shade of green with gold and red accents.I don't put these Lenox ornaments on the tree but rather I line them up on a shelf where they are out of danger -- well, relatively so.  They make such a pretty arrangement and I love looking at them.So, now that I have had my ornament fix I hate to have to put them away.  I decorated in stages this year so it wasn't such a chore --- I wanted to enjoy it -- and I think I will undecorate the same way this year.  I can't say I will enjoy it but maybe it won't be so bad.A View From A Window ThursdayI have been participating in an event every Thursday called A View From A Window, hosted by Jane at The Maple Syrup Mob.  Due to the holidays I have been remiss in posting the last couple of weeks so I will make up for it today.The first two photos are from two weeks ago -- I got them taken but just didn't get them posted.Rainy DayThe next two photos are from last week.Chilly DayThe last two photos are from today.Promise of a Really Nice Day to End the YearWe are having a warm spell these first few days after Christmas but if you look closely you will see that the freezes of days past have taken our umbrella plant, our cannas and all our purslane.  My husband doesn't care for bedding plants but I am thinking that some lovely purple and yellow pansies would be nice to replace the purslane.  What do you think?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, December 28, 2011", "text": "Christmas Has Past --And it was one of the bloody worst holidays I can remember.  Now, you must keep in mind, that when my children were small, I can barely remember a holiday where one or the other of my children didn't have an earache or a sore throat or a cough or some form of respiratory misery.   But, this year was our first to spend in the emergency room.Our holiday season began quite well.  We were invited to several \"events\" with my daughter, her husband and their small daughter affectionately known as Bean.  Not her real name, although it probably should be, long story, another time.  Anyway, we saw Santa, we ate out several times, we went to the Gaylord to see the lights and decorations, we were zipping merrily through the holidays and doing quite well.  Nobody was completely exhausted yet and things were getting done at a nice pace. Our weekly Advent lessons were anticipated and enjoyed. Moving on to Christmas Eve morning.  I was chatting with DD on the phone when she said something along the lines of \"OMG, she's cracked her head open, gotta go\".  Next phone call, was \"how do I stop bleeding\".  Next phone call, \"what do I do if it won't stop\".  Next phone call \"why won't that damn ambulance get here\".  Next phone call \" we are in the ambulance, meet you at Cooks\".  I finally got around to asking how large the cut was -- 1/2 inch but deep.  Five stitches in that tiny forehead.  The most unfashionable of bandages -- didn't go with the gorgeous Christmas dress at all but it did  make her look like she had bangs/fringe.  Have I mentioned that I am a nervous person? But, I don't flinch at blood so I'm all good -- sort of.Church was fine although we were all shaken up.  The children's service is  always great fun -- it is so interesting to hear the children participate in the service.  Bean was in the middle of the fray so she was up for the challenge.Didn't sleep too well that night, just worried but then, it is what I do best so there you go.  Christmas Day was spent at home with the kids coming over in the evening.  Our son didn't join us -- can't remember why, oh yes, I can,  never mind -- nothing unexpected here.  There was gift opening and a fantastic honey baked ham obviously cooked by somebody other than myself. The birthday cake for Jesus was good even though it is clear  that I can't write with frosting!  It was a good time.  Didn't sleep well that night -- oh yes, the mountain cedar is alive and well and pollinating profusely.  That will do it.Monday and Tuesday brought us house guests in the form of DD, Bean and SIL.  Their heater was acting up and we had had a cold snap so they had an extended vacation with us -- great for us, not so swell for them.  Tuesday was spent with Hubs and I helping them out while they dealt with the heater people who don't seem to know much about heaters even though they are a large, well known company with really big trucks.  All of that was compounded by a gas leak at the meter -- gas company was out in a flash, took care of it and it was pronounced fixed.  The second heater guy was good -- it is fixed -- they are warm and all is good.  You probably haven't guessed that I am a nervous person.So, that brings us to last night -- I was completely wrung out -- even a seasoned \"nervous person\" has their limits.  I have done a lot of soul searching and have made some New Year's Resolutions already.  After 61 years of holiday mania, family drama, striving for \"perfection\" and always failing in somebody's eyes, I am done.  Passing the baton so to speak.  I have officially become the Grandma that visits.  I will bring the bowl of potato salad or not.  I will help clean the kitchen or not.  Or I will sit home, watch my favorite movie with the Hubs and drink hot tea.  Whatever happens I will be living in the season, not of the season.  I have moved past the trappings of accepted and expected frivolity.  I will not be coerced or cajoled into doing things I don't want to do.  I will throw away every Christmas ad when they begin arriving in, what is it now, July?  I will participate when I want and send everybody good wishes when I don't.I am tired and this rant will probably mellow over the next few months but I am serious -- I am  done."},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, December 12, 2011", "text": "12 December 2011Time for another Musing Mondays over at Should Be Reading hosted by Miz B.Today's question is What kind of books do you like to read?  Why?  Provide specific examples.I guess I never really thought to analyze my reading preferences but, when asked this question I had to take a long look at my shelves and see if I could see a trend.  Yes, there is definitely a pattern to my reading.  I tend to read books about the human condition, lots of family related books, not without conflict but with a definite happy ending.  I also tend to read series books and once I decide I like an author, I find I read many of his/her books.I am not sure why I read series books, or books with sequels, so much but, upon further review, I think I always have.  My first \"series\" books was Honey Bunch's First Visit to Puppyland.I was quite small when I received this book, I couldn't read it but I remember being read to and liking the concept of \"chapters\".  As an adult I have collected a few more of the Honey Bunch books.  Nothing like a collection.Once I began school, one of my favorite things was the \"required\" book list we received every September.  This was a mimeographed list (anybody remember the purple ink?) of age appropriate books that we were to choose a certain number from, read, and write a book report -- all without prompting from the teacher.  We were just supposed to do it and turn it in on our own.  I think back, then it was called \"responsibility\".  I don't think it exists anymore.  I digress.  One of my favorite authors was Kate Seredy and I loved the books in the Good Master series.  I loved the covers, the illustrations and the stories.  I read them all.Another author that I enjoyed as a child was Laura Lee Hope of The Bobbsey Twin fame.  My very favorite book was The Bobbsey Twins at Tower London.  I remember Christmas shopping with my mother, finding the book and she buying it for me.  I was probably too old for it but I loved it anyway.  I guess I was interested in my \"roots\" way back then, as well, and was always fascinated by all things UK.Shortly after my love affair with all these children's books (I still love them, honestly) I stumbled across Shirley Jackson's books after seeing \"The Haunting of Hill House\" in about 1963 or so.  Quite a far cry from The Bobbsey Twins but I couldn't get enough of her writings and while I thoroughly enjoyed \"The Haunting\" book, I really liked We Have Always Lived in the Castle and have read it more than once.  I thought I had acquired all that Jackson had to offer until recently when I discovered another book called The Lottery, published in 1948.  My copy includes this title as well as twenty four other short stories.  I haven't read it yet because I am caught up in my current series but I think it is the next on my list when I need a break from Aunt Dimity.As an adult, I still love series books. I have read most of the entire Woman of Substance series as well as Jan Karon's Mitford series.While I am anxiously awaiting a third book in the Father Tim series, I am enjoying the Aunt Dimity series by Nancy Atherton.  I have never been a huge mystery fan but these are really nice little books and aren't so involved as to confuse this easily confused brain!  There are fifteen books in the Aunt Dimity series and I am on number five.  They are short books and shouldn't take me as long to read them as they do but I am easily distracted.  I managed to space them out so that I am reading the \"Christmas\" book now -- good planning, don't you think?I would be remiss if I didn't mention Beverly Lewis and all her books about the Amish community in Pennsylvania.  I am not Amish nor do I live in Pennsylvania but I find that I really enjoy these books.  I don't know whether it is the inspirational message or the vision of a connected family life that is seems to be diminishing in mainstream American or just the diversion of reading about a culture different from my own but, whatever it is, I find them to be very relaxing reading even though quite predictable.So, there is my answer -- sorry it is so long!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, December 11, 2011", "text": "Cold and Dark Sunday MorningIt is very early -- barely six a.m.  Yet, I am up having my morning cuppa and putting off making oatmeal which I don't enjoy doing.  However, in a quest for better health  I will do in a little while.  I am alone since Hubs is still snoring away. I wouldn't be awake right now if I could  stay up a bit later but it seems that lately I am turning into a pumpkin about 8:30.  Hubs is into action adventure movies which I am not so I sort of just pass out from boredom.  If I sit and read while he watches, I put myself to sleep so I guess I am doomed to an early bedtime regardless of what I do.  However, it does cause me  to wake up early and here I am.  I have come to enjoy this quiet time before the rush of the day begins.Last night we were invited to go to an outdoor shopping center close to my daughter's house.  We were going to see Santa for the first time with Beanie.  It was cold, I was concerned because we don't need another ear infection.  However, the line was short and  it didn't take long for us to have our turn.  I won't lie --- it didn't go well.  It was like Beanie knew it was expected of her to reject the whole thing and scream and scream she did.  It made me smile.  My own children didn't like the whole fake Santa thing either and, honestly, neither did I.  I have one photo of me at three taken with a department store Santa that I am keeping at arms length away with the look of sheer terror on my face even though I was smiling.  It was sorta funny and sorta sad.  I remember that photo being taken, though, and how I felt and I never pushed Santa on my kids.  That wasn't our emphasis anyway.  The shopping center was heavily lit and we enjoyed the lights as I continued piling all manner of cover on top of Beanie to keep her warm.  She looked sort of like a little mummy with pink mittens and a pink snowman hat sticking out!  I think she enjoyed it but what she mostly wanted to do was climb the stairs to the bar at the restaurant where we were having dinner.  Nothing like a flight of stairs to zap all the excitement out of Christmas lights, horse drawn carriages and Santa!As I watched this little child take in all that was being offered I had some of the joy of the Christmas season return to me.  You know, things just aren't the same when you grow up and your children grow up -- the vision is just different which isn't a bad thing but it is different.  It was delightful to see Christmas through the eyes of a child again.I have spent some time this morning studying the Advent lesson for this week.  We are doing the Advent candle each Sunday evening with Beanie.  Tonight the pink candle, for joy, will be lit and she will be doing the lighting with a lot of assistance, of course.  She seems to be enjoying our little ritual, she has been praying since birth so she very reverently folds her hands and is quiet through the prayer.  I like to think that these candles are as awesome to her as the lights in the shopping center.As I sit here, with my warm tea, I am aware that the cold darkness of the morning is so representative to me of the quiet time before the birth of the Baby that would change everything like the light and warmth that will come when we light the candles this evening.  To me, lighting these three candles tonight will be more magical and meaningful than all the lights and horse-drawn carriages in the town center.   I hope Beanie feels it as well.Well, guess it is time to cook that oatmeal -- we are going to early church and I always fast for at least an hour before communion so I best get on with it. Oh yeah, I have to wake up Sleeping Beauty in there, too!  Have a wonderful Sunday!"},

Not the whole week -- just the latter half.  Up until Wednesday we were having a really great time getting ready for Christmas, putting up the village and having a babysitting day.  Wednesday was planned to get some Christmas sewing done and finish some decorating.  We were having a ball around here just relaxing with the gorgeous weather and getting into the swing of the season.Then the call came.  It was around lunch time on Wednesday when my phone rang.  It was my daughter's best friend from San Antonio who now lives in Austin.  It was unusual for her to phone, we talk on the computer from time to time but she never calls.  She lives on Ave. G in Austin, two doors down from a little, independent church which was begun by my cousin thirty three years ago and which he still pastors.  She had met my cousin on a number of occasions, once when we were visiting her.  She called to give me bad news.  My cousin and his wife had been killed in a horrific accident outside of Austin on a highway that was undergoing construction.  I simply couldn't process what she was saying.  I have never felt such shock, it was like I had been slapped.  We are supposed to go visit this young woman and her new baby and I had been planning on taking my cousins to dinner.  I was planning.  What was she saying?  This just couldn't be. After much internet searching I found news story after news story, photo after photo and video after video.  I watched them even though I knew I shouldn't.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  It was horrific and tragic and my cousin was gone.  I spent the rest of the day trying to get information.  I called his church and was told that I couldn't be a relative, he didn't have any relatives.  They were rude.  I was hurt.  I had to break the news to my aunt and her daughter -- it was so sad because he was to officiate the wedding of my cousins child in January.   I had a strange relationship with this cousin.  He was my father's first cousin, my second cousin, even though he was only three years older than I.  I know him even though we didn't talk on a regular basis.  I called on him many times for help and he was always there to help me.  I always looked at him as someone who would always be there for me  because he was always there for me.  I counted on him for strength and guidance on a number of occasions and I will really miss him. He was really a great guy.His wife had said that she didn't want either one of them to \"go\" first and either one of them to have to live without the other.  I find it very comforting to know that is exactly what happened.  That just shows me, once again, that God listens and knows what is best for us.I have been very sad but on Thursday, as I traveled to my daughter's house in the dark of morning, I could see his face and hear his voice telling me \"we are fine (in the Texas drawl he had) -- don't be so sad -- just get on with it.  We are fine\" and he was chuckling as the vision faded.  I know they are fine but it is really hard to not be sad."},

So, if anybody has missed me, that is where I have been --- sitting, sitting, sitting, planning, planning, planning.  Now I have get in the mood to cook for Thanksgiving.  Whew, I think I am tired already."},

Diet Update --Yes, well, have fallen off the program again -- after years of keeping a food diary I just can't do it any more.  However, after doing it for several days I am aware that it isn't my calorie intake that is causing me problems but more my lack of exercise.  So.....yesterday I began an exercise program.  I walked on the Tony Little Gazelle for 20 minutes -- need to start slow and I did some sit-ups.  My goal is to do this every day and see if it matters.  I received some old photos of my dad from a dear friend this last week and I have to say that if heredity is mostly to blame then I am doomed.  I am just the female version of my dad and there is nothing much that can be done about that so maybe, instead of focusing on appearance, I need to focus on health, put on a big smile and just carry on!Current read --I am currently readiing \"An American Heiress\" by Daisy Goodwin.  It was loaned to me by my daughter who still had loads of library time on it.  She reviewed it as \"Jane Austen only readable\" and I have to agree.  It is very Downtown Abbey with a whole lot of America thrown in and it is very engaging.  I have already located a copy at the bookstore around the corner just in case I don't get done before it is due. It is hard to believe it is Thursday, already but then it is hard to believe it is close to mid-November.  I think the days are doing double time the older I get.  For some reason, the time change has really bothered me this autumn -- it usually doesn't but this year it has been a bear.  Does the time change bother you?Well, the quiet time is drawing to a close and time to start the day.  I will check back later to see what excitement all of you have been up to today!"},

So, this is what I learned about some famous birthdays on today's date.Godzilla, Japanese monster, 1954Kate Capshaw, Fort Worth, Texas, 1952 -- a hometown gal!Roseanne Barr, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1952Last but definitely not least -- Lulu -- 1948 -- Scotland -- well known for her performance in \"To Sir With Love\" one of my all time favorite movies!This one --not this one!There were many others, of course, but these are the ones that appealed to me.BTT, Thirty Days of Thanks, and -- groan -- The DietToday's question is \"All other things being equal, would you rather read a book that's hard/challenging/rewarding or light/enjoyable/easy?\"This a difficult question because I think it depends on the book.  I love historical fiction and sometimes that gets very involved and difficult to keep up with yet, in the end, it is very rewarding.  There are some days, however, where something light/easy is just what you need.  I read for entertainment and pleasure and I don't need too much of a challenge -- this isn't school, after all.Thirty Days of ThanksDay 3 -- I am thankful for my husband.THE DIETOk, I will admit -- I have always had weight issues.  Even when I was a teenager and appeared thinner, I still had issues.  Part of it is my build -- I always tended to have longer arms and legs but my body was short and a bit squarish.  I was always envious of my mother's short, yet proportionate, stature.  I was always a bit out of kilter.  When I would  sit next to my mother, we were the same height, however, when I would stand, I was several inches taller than she, thanks to the long legs.  I always likened myself to a kiwi bird -- short, stocky build (thanks Dad) and long arms and legs (have no clue where they came from).  So, even if my weight was normal, which it was most of my life, my shape was just a bit wonky.  I was never happy, even when I was a size 5 when I was about 23.I have gained weight twice in my life and  I have seriously dieted twice in my life and I lost the weight by portion control  and exercise.  Note to anybody who might be reading this with the same issue -- trust me, if I can do it, anybody can do it.  The first time was right after we were married -- I gained some weight not unlike the \"freshman 15\" but more correctly the \"newlywed 20\".  Well, I got a look at myself in the mirror one day and knew something needed to change so out came the calorie counter, the notebook and onto the floor I went doing the pilates routine I did in my college dance class.  I lost the 20 and a lot more.  I was pretty happy until I saw a photo  and didn't recognize myself.  My little round face bore all the signs of a raging anorexic -- so did the visibly prominent hip bones.  It didn't matter because shortly thereafter, I was pregnant and it wasn't a problem anymore.  I only gained a little with the baby and it was gone immediately.  I went home from the hospital in pre-pregnancy clothes and all was right with my world.  Four years later I delivered my second child.  I had gained too much weight, went home in maternity clothes and struggled from then on.  At one point, when the baby was about 6 months old, I had my thyroid checked, it was overactive.  The situation was never addressed and nobody ever mentioned it again.  So, I plodded along through any number of family/personal \"situations\" and the weight just gradually, but steadily, crept up.  About seven years ago  I read a book called \"Is Your Thyroid Making You Fat\".  It involves a diet of 1000 calories a day for 28 days followed by a number of calculations to determine how \"under active\" your thyroid is as an explanation to your weight issues.  I did it, I lost a lot of weight, I did the calculations and whoa -- my thyroid was working at 150%.  Back to the hyper business.  But, in true Melissa form, did I had to the doctor to get tested again?  Nope.  I stayed on the diet for nine months, losing a LOT of weight, until one day I decided I was hungry, actually feeling ill, and that was the end of that ball game -- not unlike the recent World Series for Texas Rangers fans.  The weight all came back on, minus about 20 pounds, and I am back to square one.  I am not happy -- actually, miserable would be a good adjective to use here.  Fast forward to Halloween.  I dressed all in black with cat ears and a, drum roll please, tail to go to my daughters little shindig.  Well, my dear hubby seemed to have forgotten the cardinal rule of no photo taking of Moi -- future generations  will just have to be satisfied with high school photos of me.  Well, the photos were downloaded, I looked at them, and here is my summation -- Hubs needs some photography lessons, particularly in regards to lighting, and I need to lose half of me.  I was one fat cat.  So, here I go again.I have tried getting back in the calorie counting routine any number of times, each requiring some new recording supplies -- cute notebooks, special pens -- color coded even -- an app for my nook -- I even tried Weight Watchers -- twice.  Guess I just wasn't in the mood.  Well, after the Halloween photo shoot my mind was changed so I went online trying to find some sort of easy calorie tracking program.  I thought I had tried them all but apparently not.  I ran across my fitness pal and set up an account.  It is so easy.  I have actually kept up with it for a couple of days.  It is very user friendly and straightforward.  I think I might be able to do with this program for a while.  I weighed in this morning and am down 1.5 pounds.  I don't ever intend to disclose my beginning weight -- use your imagination -- whatever a fat cat would weigh -- but I will record my loss here.  Maybe if I share it I will be more successful.  Maybe it will be like weight watchers meetings -- haha -- never would go to one of those! So, anyway, from time to time expect an update on my latest endeavor.  It shouldn't be a surprise that this would be my next step in building my new, frugal life, now should it?  I mean, it is just another  type of frugality, isn't it?  We will see how it plays out. Ok, must go get my Thursday started.  It is cold out and quite dark even though it is after 7 a.m.   I will be glad for this weekend with the time change.  I could use a little more sleep!"},

I digress.While reading one of my favorite blogs -- Angela's Tracing Rainbows -- I  discovered a  new site that I hadn't seen before called PomPom's Ponderings.  I decided to give it a look and was completed charmed! So cute and creative -- I will visit again soon and have added her to my blogroll. You can find Tracing Rainbows on my blogroll as well.Well, today is starting out promising.  Supposedly we will close on the house this morning and possibly celebrate with lunch or dinner out -- who knows.  I think I am getting past my creative slump and feeling a bit more energetic this morning -- that is what reading blogs does to me.  It gets me going and now, after reading Joy's blog about fountain pens, I want a fountain pen complete with cartridges. You can find this discussion at Supply Cabinet Chronicles also listed in my blogroll. So, with a renewed interest in things and my mind going a mile a minute, I think I should go get ready for THE CLOSING.  If it doesn't happen, I am sure you will be able to hear me screaming wherever you might be.  I will let you know what happens -- wish us luck although luck really shouldn't have anything to do with it at this point.  More on that later.Have a wonderful day, everyone!Aunt Dimity Digs InToday's teaser is from  page 28.I could scarcely believe it myself, much less explain how it worked, or why Dimity's spirit lingered in the cottage long after her mortal remains had departed the earth -- but I couldn't deny the evidence of my own eyes.  The skeptic within me fell silent each time Aunt Dimity's words appeared, written in royal-blue ink in her fine copperplate, on the blue journal's blank, unlined pages. So, there you go.  I wish I had a blue journal that somebody would write to me in."},

Why or why not?I have never listened to an audio book.  I am not sure why but it seems like a great thing to do now when I drive back and forth to my daughter's house -- I might try it! It Is Monday -- That Explains a LOTThe last week has been horrendous.  I haven't felt well.  Let's just say you don't really want to know and leave it at that.  We have been trying to get this stupid house closed on and just can't seem to get there -- so close and yet so far away.  The buyers signed the papers on Friday but, oddly, they didn't have any money with them.  Not sure why they were allowed to sign without money but they did.  We were told we could come in that afternoon and sign --- uh, no, not without some money! We weren't  home anyway to get the call so we missed that \"window of opportunity\" -- probably better since there WASN'T ANY MONEY!  So, we called this morning to see what was up, they said the person dealing with it wasn't in the office yet but they would call us.  We finally called at three after hanging out all day waiting and they said they still didn't have the money but we would sign at 11 tomorrow.  Really.  Well, we aren't signing anything unless there is some money for me to see.  Seriously, this whole thing has turned into a complete farce -- word of warning -- do lots and lots of \"checking\" if you decide to sell to an investor.  Make sure your investor is, indeed, an investor and not just a middle-person.  Make sure that the person has some experience and does things in a logical order.  Our \"person\" was clearly a novice and it actually cost her several thousand dollars as well as  good BBB rating.  I will probably make a report.  This has been excrutiating.Then, in my effort to save money and be green, I decided to go back to  my childhood and buy Ivory dishwashing liquid.  I now remember why I quit using it.  My hands have cracked, bled, and itched until they were raw.  I woke up in the night scratching myself raw.  I tried gloves but I am such a weird, random, kitchen cleaner that it was off and on and off and on and finally I just got annoyed.  I refuse to buy the Caldrea soap I have been using because I think it is too pricey so I settled on Method.  My hands have calmed down and I feel better.  Lesson learned -- not all cost saving methods are really great.I seem to be slipping back into the insomnia pattern I experienced some years back.  Twice this week I started my day before dawn -- one at 3:30 a.m. and the next day found me up ironing at 4:30 a.m.  Saturday night found me snoozing like a baby until 2:30 a.m. when my DD called to let me know a huge storm was coming my way and she knew my car was out of the garage.  Well, I spent about 30 minutes watching the weather on tv and, after all that, I almost couldn't get back to sleep but I did and managed to stay that way until 8:30 a.m.  It seems like I have gone through my entire adult like on a substantial amount of sleep deprivation -- not a good memory!I think the lack of sleep in causing my latest slump -- or maybe the weather that can't decide if it want to be summer or fall.  It just seems like all I want to do is clean house and read.  I am not interested in quilting or stitching or anything.  Ok, I seem to have this irrational interest in cooking.  That is very odd -- very.So, that is what I have been doing.  Reading and cooking.  Cleaning and NOT sleeping.   Maybe this week will be more interesting -- I have to sew a cap for  my granddaughter's Halloween costume -- she is going to be a chicken.  I will definitely post photos of that!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, October 17, 2011", "text": "Musing Mondays -- 17 October 2011The question today is \"do you judge a book by its cover?\".  Unfortunately, yes, I do.  I have read some really lousy books that way, too, and I am sure I have bypassed some wonderful books for the same reason.  I can't help it, I love a pretty book!And this one time -- at the grocery store --Since Hubs retirement, we have been sort of tap dancing through our days trying to sort out our roles.  He seems to be under the impression that because he is no longer working at a job outside of the home that all his time is playtime and that my job goes on without a hitch -- clearly no \"retirement\".   It seems that we have traded places -- he is home and I am babysitting the Bean and so I am gone and he isn't.  When I came home a couple of weeks ago I was more than a little miffed to find him sitting in the same chair watching the same television that I left him at in the morning.  We are working on this little hiccup and, in an attempt to mend his evil ways, he decided to do the grocery shopping one day.  We frequent a grocery store that is a spin off of the store that he worked at when we were teenagers.  It is different than the regular chain and has different things and a huge wine section and many organic fruits and veggies.  They also have a large bakery which, honestly, I am not all that taken with.  I tend to prefer my homemade bread machine bread.  But, I digress.  The day he went they had put out a lot of muffins that can be bought individually so he called and asked me if I wanted one.  He gets really excited about these muffins because they do have some sugar-free varieties. So, I said yes and to get me one of the white chocolate apricot  ones.  I couldn't wait for the evening to get here to sit down with my tea and my muffin and watch \"Parenthood\".  Well, I took a bite from the top and it was really salty but I thought I was just an odd bite and I dove into the middle.  It was all good until I got a piece of the edge -- VERY salty and a little chemical tasting.  I gave a bit to Hubs to taste and he couldn't swallow it and the next bite -- I know, why was there even a next bite -- I figured it was poisoned.  If the store hadn't already been closed I would have returned it but instead I sat there wondering if rat poison tastes salty.  I figure somebody either got the sugar and salt mixed up or put too much of some additive in it but whatever happened it was exceptionally bad and I spent the rest of the evening trying to decide if I should look for the ipecac or call a lawyer.  In the end, I did nothing and I was fine but I have pretty much decided to eat only my own food from now on.I have finished Aunt Dimity's Good Deed  and, as with the other's I have read in this series, enjoyed it thoroughly.  In this \"episode\", if you will, we were introduced to the extended Willis family which builds on the previous two books.  While these books can be read alone, it is great fun reading them in order and learning how all the  people fit together without just going on a brief back story description.  I will be starting the next one, Aunt Dimity Digs In, tonight.I have also just finished When the Light Goes by Larry McMurtry.  It is the sequel to Duane's Depressed.  It is just as funny and poignant and quite a bit shorter than the other books in the series and it was a quick read.  The book begins with Duane's return to Thalia from Egypt, only a two week span of time from the end of the previous book, but things have changed and not for the better.  He makes some major life decisions, has some major surgery, and starts his life over for the second time.  When I began the book, I figured that it would end with Duane's end but I was very wrong -- didn't see THAT one coming! Yep, not gonna tell you -- you will have to read it yourself.I have also been working at reading a book entitled \"Leaving the Saints\" by Martha Beck.  I have had it on my shelf for a long, long time and I think I bought it because of a tv interview.  Well, I decided to give it a go and now I am going to give it a toss.  It is about a woman, the author, who is the daughter of a high ranking leader of the LDS church.  It chronicles her major health problems as well as her quest for some sort of spiritual understanding and peace.  The book started out a bit disturbing but when she started discussing flashbacks and describing the horrible abuse she was subjected to by her father from the age of 5 to 8, well, I was done.  The book is frank, graphic and horrific and I cannot continue to read it.  I am sorry, Martha, for what you went through and for your dysfunctional family and I really hope you regained your health and found peace but I will never know because I cannot read your book.  Had I known the contents of this book I would never have purchased it but it won't have a place in my personal library.  I am sorry.And, on a sad note, the last remaining member of my dad's circle of friends has passed away, night before last.  I cannot remember a time when Jim Houston was not involved with our family. He was a character with a good heart and he will be missed. I was invited to his 90th birthday party but couldn't go so I sent him some chocolate covered strawberries and balloons and he put the balloons on his wheel chair! He apparently got a real kick out of them. As I told his daughter, as long as he was still around I felt like part of my dad was still around but now he is gone.  I told his grandson that I can just picture him and his wife and my folks sitting around catching up -- I am sure my dad was there to meet him on the other side -- him talking remote control airplanes while my dad doodled cartoons on a paper napkin.  Yep, that's what they are doing. Rest in peace, Big Guy."},

Where has this month gone to?  Just an update -- part of the papers for the house sale have been signed -- an amended contract which has made the Hubs even growlier (is that a word?) and we will close somewhere around the 19th.   I am having a lot of mixed emotions with this house sale.  We moved into our current house about six years ago and I love the house.  It is a garden home although we have a huge yard -- go figure-- and it is as much house as I want to vacuum.  I wouldn't mind another bedroom for a sewing room but I don't do that much sewing so it is ok.  We have been very happy here but it doesn't feel like home because there is no history.  In each of my previous houses I have memories of my children and in this home all I have is memory of a husband with heart surgery and a blind/deaf/diabetic/senile cairn terrier that I had to put down.  Oh, and Rollie the cat that I had to give up because everybody is allergic to cats.  So, I need to figure out how to make this house \"home\" and I am not doing a very good job of it -- maybe I need to adopt a child -- I don't think anybody is allergic to children. Hmmm..on further review,  maybe I could just borrow one.  House plants, maybe?In any event, I am, on the whole, glad to be rid of the house even though I think we have been \"taken\" or scammed or something -- can't put my finger on it but I definitely think that something is a bit askew here. That isn't how you spell \"askew\" -- is it? I digress -- be patient, it is only 5:30 a.m. Anyway, babysitting again today.  It is great fun but I have to get up so early and I am not an early riser.  Well, I am, but not THIS early -- you would think I would be getting used to it but I don't think so.Haven't had any time to participate in any of  the meme's I usually do but I will say that I have read \"Aunt Dimity's Good Deed\" and am working on the latest sequel to \"The Last Picture Show\" and a book called \"Leaving the Saints\".  I will get back to you with reviews of all of them.  I am getting a lot of reading in because I read during the baby's nap which can be as long as three hours.  Of course, I pretty much read myself to sleep but that is ok too.Well, I must go pack a lunch and get on the road -- I have an hour drive.  I lost a follower and that makes me sad -- I guess I didn't comment enough or blog often enough or about the right things and I am sorry but maybe she will be back.

{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, October 01, 2011", "text": "Duane's Depressed by Larry McMurtryI just finished reading Duane's Depressed by Larry McMurty and I have to say that I couldn't have enjoyed a book more.  In the first place, I love McMurtry and have read several of his works.  This book is the third in the series of The Last Picture Show.  In this book, Duane Moore is now sixty one years old and at a crossroads of his life.  He makes one monumental decision involving his pick-up truck and that decision leads to a chain of events that changes his, and others, lives forever.Had I read this book ten years ago, or even five for that matter, I don't think I  would have identified with it quite like I have now.  So many things that Duane worked through are things that I have thought about myself.  McMurtry seems to have a great working knowledge of human nature so I suppose the situations that the main character had to work through are sort of universal but I still thought it to be very timely for me.  Also, it is amazing to see how one simple, personal decision by one individual can impact so many people in so many different ways.  The range of emotion expressed in this book is broad -- it is funny, it is poignant, it is straight up sad, hopeless yet hopeful and, in the end, peaceful.It is a great book and I would recommend it, mostly to people of a similar age.Meal Planning 101I have been doing some considerable thinking about how we handle things here at Brinkley's Place and I am really up for some changes.  In the last two weeks I have heard several news stories about people returning to using cash instead of debit cards, checks, or just good ol' plastic.  Of course, Dave Ramsey is all for this and I have a feeling with Bank of America now charging folks for using their debit card a lot of people  are going to be rethinking  the virtures of cash -- I mean, think about it, what could be more convenient with less chance of identity theft!I realize that, in order to operate primarily with cash, I need to know how much I spend on certain things.  The first thing that comes to mind is groceries.  I am ashamed to say but I really have no idea how much money I spend on groceries because we are always running to the store for this and that -- example, I went to Target today  to pick up a prescription and a few other things but got home and realized I needed milk as well which will require another stop and I can guarantee  I won't buy just milk.  So...you see the problem.  Clearly there needs to be a list and a plan.  Last night I considered all the options to creating the plan and this is what I came up with.Growing up, my mother -- a most excellent cook -- had a plan.  We didn't have a car so she went shopping with my grandfather, her sister, my cousin and me, in his Studebaker Champion -- I am not sure how we all fit in there with three families groceries as well.My father got paid every two weeks so she shopped for two weeks.  If we ran out of basics, like milk, she walked to one of two convenience stores a block from the house --  Zim's to the north or Thompson's to the south.I liked the way my mother planned our meals.  The first of the week -- usually on Sunday, we had a big meal.  Then we had leftovers.  The rest of the week went the same way with a meat, a starch, two sides and a salad -- sometimes vegetable sometimes fruit.  We didn't have desserts often but she would buy cookies and make pudding and once in a while a cake with Swell frosting.  As she worked closer to payday the meals got less fancy and finally, the day before she shopped again we had what she called a \"poor\" meal -- usually a pot of beans with cornbread, salad and....always....a pie! That made it less \"poor\".  I actually thought that, much of the time, it was the best day of the two weeks.  She was always particular about presentation and worked to make our meals attractive and, believe it or not, she used some of the recipes she had learned in her jr. high school cooking class at the same school I went to (see yesterdays post) and....here it comes ... with the same teacher that I had.  Odd little woman named Birdie but I digress.So, going on that same premise and with the knowledge that my husband has certain likes and dislikes I have devised the plan.  I am assigning a meat to each day of the week -- ex:  Monday -- beef.  This will allow me some room to serve stuffed peppers or steak -- flexible, I believe.  Growing up in San Antonio, Wednesday was Mexican food day in school -- all schools -- and we still think in those terms.  So, Wednesday is going to be Mexican food for us. The other days will be either chicken or fish, one a meatless meal that could be soup and sandwiches, the aforementioned pot of beans or breakfast-for-supper food.  I think that will at least take the chaos out of the planning.One of my blog friends suggested that I blog my menu so I would have a permanent record of it rather than keep a notebook and I think that is a stellar idea and I will probably do it.  However, I need a visual for me to see on a daily basis to keep me focused.  While at Target today, I was searching for a dry  erase board and came across this.Hmm..the photo is sort of small but you get the idea.  I wish Thrifty Thursday was going on, even though it isn't Thursday, because this would be a great thing to mention -- I got it for 50% off which came to $2.50.  I also bought a magnetized grocery list tablet at the dollar section -- it has Snoopy on it -- who can turn their back on Snoopy? So, that is my springboard for getting control of my groceries.  I will start tomorrow since we will probably hit the grocery store in the evening.  I am going to try to be very exacting so I will know how much I need so possibly the NEXT week I can go with cash.I read an interesting post from a woman who went with only cash for two weeks and I was surprised at her comment that she felt \"poor\" while digging through her wallet counting out ones and change.  I don't feel that way, I feel empowered.  It feels good to use real money and not be frightened that by swiping the card I am possibly jeopardizing our entire financial security.  I don't know if it is the wave of the future but I think it might be the wave of MY future.Does anybody here use cash primarily?BTW -- the clip art at the top of this post came from http://americanwomendidntgetfat.blogspot.com.  The young woman who hosts that blog also has a great blog about how American women of the 40's and 50's didn't gain weight and why.  She also posts an old MetLife weight chart which I final fascinating -- it is what I grew up with being the standard for weight concerns.  It is an interesting read -- give it a look!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, September 30, 2011", "text": "It is Friday, It is Texas, It is Autumn Which Would Explain -- Cough, cough, sniffle--Yep, seems some determined allergen has blown up my nose.  I can't imagine how since I really haven't been out and yet, here I am, at the beginning of a gorgeous weekend taking Mucinex and anticipating a dose of Benadryl later on -- closer to nap time.  The nose is stopped up, the chest is a tad tight and the ears are all muffley and popping -- yes, it is autumn in Texas.I don't really have much to post today -- the recent rant has left me wordless -- probably a good thing.  I am still reading \"Duane's Depressed\" and it is so enlightening -- expresses a lot of what I am feeling/thinking about right now.  Larry McMurtry is such a fantastic writer with such understanding of the human condition.  It is amazing and I haven't really been able to put this book down for long.I have been doing a lot of thinking about meal planning this morning.  I recognize that we have a new, national, meal planning model in the form of a plate replacing the old food planning model in the form of a pyramid which replaced the even older meal planning formula that I learned in cooking class at this school.  I am not sure if it had a shape or not. However, my husband is a diabetic that is a very picky eater.  By picky, I mean no soup, no stew, no casserole, no food mixed together at all unless it is Mexican food, no sauces .....you get the picture.  So, it makes it really difficult to feed the meat-and-potatoes guy when all he wants is what he shouldn't have.  I still plan my meals according to the above mentioned junior high school cooking class plan -- a meat, a starch, two sides and, of course being from the south, iced tea.  Doesn't sound like it should be too hard, does it? Ha! The Hubs cooked last night and it was delightful -- a fantastic t-bone that he grilled right here on our patio during a burn ban -- loves living dangerously -- roasted fresh corn and a baked potato.  Too many carbs for the diabetic and a whole lot of red meat for the bypass survivor (him, not me) but it was scrumptious for sure.  He was even lauding himself for only dirtying two plates and a platter.  That was good for me!  Anyway, I digress ... I went online this morning looking for a meal planner to print out and threw that idea right out the door.  I mean, why use printer paper and ink when I can either print one and have it laminated to use like a dry erase board, buy a dry erase board, or use some of the notebook paper I buy in huge quantities during school supply sales.  Why?  I have no idea, force of habit, I guess.  Anyway, I found some lovely calendars to be printed here many of which would be useful if you are designing your own planner.  I might give it some thought but for now, notebook paper it is.  A spiral notebook might be a good idea as well and then you have a permanent record of your menus.  That might be preferable to the notebook paper.  This will definitely take more thought as I don't want to be wasteful.The summer's heat has taken a huge toll on our garden and it isn't looking so good.  We had considerable landscaping done about three years ago and even some of those established plants are suffering.  However the cannas are thriving and actually flourishing. We also have a couple of interesting little creatures living under the kamado.As best we can tell, they are male and female -- don't ask how I know that - one is just smaller -- so I won't be surprised if we have a bunch of tiny ones running around.Last year I decided to plant a mint plant in a pot and true to my gardening form, it died a swift death.  However, this year it came up -- in the flower bed! I told the Hubs that unless he wanted it to take over everything he needed to move it to a spot on its on and he did and this is what it has done --It has again surfaced in the flower bed and we will be making another mint bed on the other side of the patio soon.  I always heard that mint was hearty and difficult and I guess what I heard was right.We made some silly bird feeders to try to lure the birds back after the building mess behind us was finished -- they are coming back and hopefully the bunnies will too.  I have heard via the neighborhood grapevine that the coyotes are alive and well -- and have gotten into the neighborhood. We planted some verbena to complement the lantana and invite the butterflies into the yard.And, thanks to Bean, we successfully installed our attack cat -- doesn't seem to be working too well as we now have a rather large, fuzzy, orange cat semi-living on our patio which I don't particularly mind except that he/she/it decided to try to get one of our cardinals and that just won't do.  I haven't been able to catch a snap yet -- maybe in the morning.  So, that is life in our garden.  After the year-long building project behind us and the hellish heat, I think it might be coming back to life -- if the allergies don't kill me today I think I might just enjoy it outside tonight and see what sort of photos I can capture."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, September 28, 2011", "text": "Good News and a Whole Lot of Randomness -- Warning, this is sort of a RantAs reported here, in previous posts, a few months ago I began a campaign to help all mankind by keeping more of my money from the utility company and reduce my carbon footprint at the same time.  I started slowly with line drying clothes and washing dishes by hand more often.  The clothes drying has been absolutely theraputic and I don't know why, I just know I don't feel like a slave to the dryer anymore.  The hand dishwashing was a bit more difficult because I really don't like it but I persevered until I had company one day and had more dishes than usual and just couldn't help myself.  However, I did have the good sense about me to reconfigure my settings and use only a normal wash and air dry.  I mean, nobody was sick so I didn't feel the need to \"sanitize\" the dishes.  I have used the d/w twice that way and, again, felt like I was more efficient with hand washing.  So, the first bill after I started this little experiement came up $20 less! I was thrilled.  Well.....the latest bill came and it was -- drumroll, please -- $100 less! Of course, the Hubs reminded me that our weather has cooled down a bit and so the a/c isn't running as much but I refuse to think that my efforts aren't contributing to that savings.  I just had to share.I have been doing a lot of thinking about things lately and I really don't know why.  I am not sure what set me on the path to save energy and money -- I have never been particularly ecologically concerned.  I have never been a wasteful person but I have never been so intrigued by the subject until now and I don't know why.  I am not sure whether the \"simple living\" concept really has anything to do with ecology or rather more to do with me being overwhelmed with stuff -- materially and conceptually.  I am pretty sure it has something to do with my age and feeling like all the rules of what I have to do and what I should be don't really apply to me anymore.My recent haircut, for instance, is testament to the fact that I no longer feel the need to subscribe to any edict about what a woman of my age -- or any age for that matter -- is supposed to look like.  I just got tired of all the money going for product, all the time put into something that I didn't really enjoy anymore, and all the expectation of what I should look like when it didn't work for me anymore.  I am happier not having to mess with The Hair.  I think my hair is healthier for it, too, because I have really become conscious of all the chemicals in the products we all take for granted and I am not sure I really want all that stuff on my head! So, here is a photo of The Hair, taken in my bathroom by me so that is why you are only getting part of it -- sorry -- but the other side looks pretty much the same.That brings us to the subject of cosmetics.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE cosmetics.  I love looking at them and I love buying them.  What's the problem you say?  Well, I don't love using them!  I have a drawer in my vanity chock full of all sorts of makeup -- and I don't really use it.  I have narrowed it down to a few products --Origins Tinted Moisturizer in the lightest color available Origins eyeliner in mushroom EccoBella lipstick in Cafe Au LaitPlantscriptionsI also have been using Jane Iredale mascara but they won't let me upload a photo.  I will not use it again after I finish what I have -- it is WAY too expensive to not be any different than any other mascara.Now, the question is, what do I do with the pounds and pounds of other stuff?  I have purged this drawer before only to go out and fill it back up again -- that isn't very fiscally responsible nor environmentally responsible -- all those plastic packages have to go someplace!  My bad!  Maybe I need an intervention! The truth is, though, that I want to throw it away.  I am beginning to feel smothered by possessions.  I like the feeling of freedom that having less affords me.  I also like the feeling of freedom that I get now that I have learned that I am ok just as I am and I don't have to try to create a new me with tons of cosmetics.  It doesn't work anyway, I am still me!Another thing that has crossed my mind is how I spend my time -- when not hanging laundry or washing dishes, that is.  I have been a quilter for years.  I have a really nice sewing machine that the Hubs decided I needed to have a few years back and I really like it.  For some reason, however, I have the unbridled desire to hand piece a quilt.  I mean, what is THAT?  Torture?  I don't think so.  I love magazines to a fault and most of my mag purchases are quilting or cross stitch in nature.  I look at the photos and the quilts are getting more and more sophisticated requiring more and more equipment to produce them.  If you want really professional results, you need a long arm quilting machine to do your quilting.  Well, I would have to add on to the house for that but what if you don't want a \"professional looking\" quilt, you just really, really want to sit down with little pieces of fabric, a needle and thread, and mindlessly sew?  I used to be a purist and want everything to be hand done and then I got the fancy sewing machine and have been more and more frustrated as time has gone on.  I was fishing through some fabric a couple of weeks ago and I found a little piece that I had done by hand -- it isn't finished, of course, and I think I was just doing it to try my hand at it but it is so nice.  It is accurate and the back doesn't look like a tangled web of thread.  I have been working on a top for a few weeks -- a Disappearing Nine Patch pattern.  It is the second I have made from this pattern and I am pretty sure the Disappearing Nine Patch is going to disappear from my go-to list of patterns.  NOT HAPPY!  So, I have decided that from now on, I am going to only employ my favorite technique for piecing -- paper piecing or I am going to hand piece.  I am not going to clutter my mind with what the magazines say I SHOULD be doing.  I am going to be my own quilter.Well, it seems I have been on quite a rant, now, doesn't it.  I don't know what has come over me.  I just know that the more I get rid of in my life -- stuff or ideas or opinions -- the happier I am becoming.  I have always tried to please other people and never myself first and for some reason I am now looking at how I want to live and think and be and the only word I can think of that would describe it is uncomplicated.  Yes, uncomplicated.So, on that note, I think I will go grab up my book and sit and read for a while -- the dishes are done and the laundry is drying so I think I can devote the time to it.  I will leave you with a photo of  a recipe I made the other day on quite the spur of the moment.  I have been testing brownie recipes to try to find a scratch recipe that tastes like boxed. So, I was looking through the Pillsbury cookbook and decided to try their brownie recipe but I also decided to try the Pumpkin Bars that were on the same page.  They were listed in the bar cookie section but they were much more cake-like and they turned our completely scrumptious! So did the brownies, by the way! Pillsbury -- who knew!  Sorry Mark Bittman -- they beat you out!"},

Heaven help me when Daylight Savings Time rolls around -- somebody really should do something about that, BTW! Ok, well, here is today's Teaser, again, from \"Duane's Depressed\" by Larry McMurtry.\"He walked straight over to Tenth Street, where he knew there was a good bike shop; within an hour he had spent five thousand dollars on a top-of-the-line bicycle, complete with helmet, biking shoes, goggles, night lights, water bottles, side packs and a dog seat.  He bought shorts, gloves, a windbreaker, and various little trail packs of high-energy foods. He bought a tool kit to repair his bike, and an excellent pump for the tires.  He bought an odometer and even a little device that would measure his pulse and his heartbeat as he rode.  The young couple who ran the store had been looking lonely when Duane came in, but were looking extremely happy as they totaled up his  purchases.\"Ok, maybe that wasn't the most compelling teaser but it was a turning point in Duane's depression -- I will say no more except that at this point in time, this book was tailor made for me.  It is funny, even though I am not sure if it is supposed to be, it is addressing a number of things that I am feeling at this time -- coincidence that Duane and I are the same age?  At any rate, the book is zipping along nicely -- yesterday I had a hard time putting it down but if you are going to follow suit and read it I would suggest you start with \"The Last Picture Show\" and \"Texasville\" for the complete backstory -- it will make more sense even though the book is standing alone nicely."},

{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, September 18, 2011", "text": "A Different Sort of SundayToday was a different sort of Sunday. It was unusually quiet and slow -- something I am not used to -- and it has been the laziest day I have had in a long, long while.It started out with me waking up much earlier than I had intended and, true to form, I couldn't go back to sleep so I got up, made my tea and toast, and had my breakfast on the patio.  It was just cool enough and just dawn enough to be really pleasant.We had made plans to attend an earlier church service because it fit in better with the Bean's new long-afternoon-nap schedule so we set off to church at 8:30 instead of 10:30.  I wasn't sure how I was going to like it because our earlier service is Rite 2 rather than Rite 1 and I am used to Rite 1.  It didn't much matter at all because I spent the hour, except for Communion in the nursery.  Bean has only been to the nursery once and, that one time, even though I stayed with her so her Mama could go to church, the separation anxiety was a bit much for all of us.  She was there for a little while and tried to get interested in what was going on but she sat on my lap and sniffled and finally just melted into a puddle of misery.  Fortunately, Mama was quick to arrive to get us for Communion and she was fine.  That has been a while ago so Mama decided to try again today.  It was a totally different situation -- when they walked in Bean tried to cry but Mama stayed with her for a while.  When I showed up I told Mama to go to church and I would stay with the Bean.  Mama really likes church and it has been a while since she has been able to sit through an uninterrupted church service.  The Bean is too little and yet too big and too wiggly to sit through a service quietly -- she is a girl on the go and would rather run than walk and she was much happier in the nursery.  It was different today because she didn't melt down, she did play with the toys and make herself at home and even though she was the only girl in the room with four boys she didn't back down -- when a scuffle ensued between two of the older boys -- approximately four years of age, she got right in the middle of it -- she wasn't fighting, she just got literally in the middle and, in essence, stopped the fight because they didn't know why the girl was getting in their way.  It was a very interesting situation to observe -- she did well with her second visit to the nursery.  We will try again next week.Of course, getting out of church two hours earlier than usual completely threw me off course.  I kept thinking it was getting close to three when it was really just noon.  I thought  I would get a lot done because I had so much time but all that really happened was I got a headache and sat most of the afternoon.  I did get a couple of kitchen drawers cleaned out and my kitchen towels sorted and re-arranged.  I hope I can remember where I put everything! This evening we decided to go the our local Barnes and Noble to browse.  I am sort of on a moratorium from magazine buying.  I culled all my cross stitch mags a few months ago and immediately recognized the error of my ways as the recycling truck picked them up so I tried to restock, swearing to never throw another magazine away again.  Well, that is all fine and good but I need to put them someplace besides where they are which is everywhere.  That may happen tomorrow - we will see.  I bought nothing at the bookstore which is strange for me.  I was looking for cross stitch reading material but all they had were British magazines which are gorgeous to look at but really expensive.  So, I passed those by.  Oh well, maybe I will find I don't need any more when I go through what I have.So, now we are going to watch a movie.  Nice quiet end to a pleasantly long day.   I hope everybody else's was as nice."},

Tim books and the Woman of Substance Trilogy were a few but, I didn't go back and re-read them because there was always the next book waiting for me.  With that said, however, I do have a few that I am going to take a look at re-reading this winter because they are just comfortable books to read!15 September 2011I don't know that I have run across any new thrifty tips of my own this week except to say that I am shopping for a toaster oven and I have been looking at my crock-pot cookbooks.  I used the dishwasher a couple of times and it broke my momentum and now I have to get on track again -- my hands looked better when I hand washing the dishes -- go figure.The one thing I did do may not qualify but here goes.  I used to get my hair done every week (isn't that what ladies of a \"certain\" age do?) and I started cutting back on that a year or so ago.  Then I decided to go longer between hair cuts -- not an especially good idea but an idea made worse when I decided to go back to cutting my own hair, something I did all the time, for years, when I was younger.  A little teasing and a lot of hairspray covered up many ills back in the day.  Well, I could no longer handle the situation -- for some reason my difficult, thin, dry, gray hair decided to grow -- a lot -- and long.  So, off to my stylist I went -- the same girl I have gone to for almost a decade and told her to do something different.  Brave, you say?  Well, as I am getting older and with the recent growth spurt, my attitude is -- it's only hair! So, we went through magazines, something we have never done together, and only one thing caught my eye and that is what we went with.  Next time, we will go shorter.While I have worn my hair short for the entirety of my adult life, this is shorter.  My hair would never curl well until it was quite long and then it would curl with no abandon -- not a good thing in the 60's when girls wanted long, straight hair -- and now, with all the gray, it isn't curling at all so to keep a short, shaggy look, I had to really work at it.  Well, no more.  It is short, caters to the \"straightness\" and gives in to the unruly grays.  Do I like it?  Not sure -- hanging a bit long in my eyes but we will see.  Will I keep it short and straight?  Probably because at my age, I really just don't care anymore.  My time is more important to me than fretting over my hair.  Are people going to look at me strangely?  Probably, especially The Girl.So, how does this work into my thrifty plan?  Well, after forking over the $45 (tip included) for this new do, I figure it takes no time to dry which saves on electricity and it requires much less product so I figure money saved there.  She flat ironed it -- not an attractive look on somebody with a fat roundish face so that will save money not having to run an extra appliance and I didn't use a curling iron or anything else -- just going straight.  Maybe it isn't a huge savings but it  is some and isn't that what counts.  Plus, my time.  My time is more valuable than anything else.  Plus, in the winter, I can throw a scarf over my head and not figure I am wrecking \"the do\".  After this horrific summer, I have no idea what the winter will be like, either -- it could be shorts weather throughout or we might be preparing for blizzards -- in either case,  my hair will work. No, dear blog readers, I won't be posting photos.  Just imagine Jamie Lee Curtis hair (a little longer) on Roseanne Barr and there you go! Ok, not going to win any beauty contests but I am still a fun girl and that is all I need to be!Off to the dentist which may leave me without any hair at all! Have a wonderful day!14 September 2011I like to participate in WWW Wednesdays hosted by Miz B at Should Be Reading but I am a little late this week.  However, better late than never I suppose so here I go.The rules for participation are to answer three questions -- what are you currently reading, what did you recently finish and what do you think you will read next.I am currently reading \"Duane's Depressed\" by Larry Mc Murtry.  I love Larry McMurtry and want to visit his book store really, really badly.   I just finished \"An Amish Christmas\" by Cynthia Kelly.  I really enjoy Amish fiction and I don't  know why -- I am not Amish and I am not sure the representation of the group is completely accurate but I still like the calmness and simple way of life that is portrayed -- a true escape for me.As far as what I am going to read next -- well, I don't know -- I need to shop my own bookshelves first but if I don't have something there hit me, I may try to find a copy of \"A Plain and Fancy Christmas\" by Cynthia Kelley (I think all the hot weather has made me wish for an early Christmas!) but more than likely I will read the third in the Aunt Dimity series -- \"Aunt Dimity's Good Deed\"."},

I realize that I could have clipped them to hangers and dried them on the shower curtain rod which is my hanging spot but this worked and I am happy.I did make brownies.  I have been experimenting with making brownies from scratch with various recipes. A while back I made a batch with a recipe from Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything cookbook.  I didn't have the proper sized pan but I made them anyway and they were to die for.  The second attempt -- not so much.  So, I figured third time's a charm right?  Armed with the proper sized pan and the knowledge that even a minute of over baking is a bad thing, I forged ahead.  They must not have turned out too badly because here are the remains.We also spent a little time Saturday morning at a craft fair at my cousin's church in Arlington.  It wasn't very large and there wasn't a huge variety of things there but we wanted to go to see the offerings as the Hubs and I are thinking of doing craft fairs as an activity. After our visit at this one, though, I am wondering if Etsy isn't the better way  to go. I had meant to take the camera and shoot some snaps but, once again, I didn't.  For some reason I just can't get in the habit of throwing the camera in my purse so I always have it.Saturday evening we spent visiting the Hubs brother and his wife.  It was a good time, dinner out at a local barbecue spot and coffee after.  Plans are in the works for my MIL's 90th birthday party and I am afraid I am going to be put in charge and that is a job I don't want.  Really - don't - want.Yesterday was spent avoiding the tv and cooking.  It was a sad day, even without the tv.  It was a surreal day -- how could ten years have already passed when it feels like the events of 9-11 just happened? As I read Facebook posts, some of which angered and frustrated me beyond reason, I thought about the days of my youth that were so seemingly innocent and stress free.  Maybe they weren't, maybe I just grew up.So begins another week with yet another visit to my friendly dentist to finally get a bridge.  I am nursing this poor, broken temporary along as I haven't had time to get back to get another made -- this dental adventure has been a bear and I hope I don't have another for a while.Time to get on with it -- see ya later!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, September 10, 2011", "text": "September 11, 2001--Where Were You?I rose early this morning which I often do.  I spend my early morning time on  the computer, sipping tea, gathering my thoughts, taking my blood pressure, all those things a person does when she has a few minutes alone.  My computer time is spent checking the newspaper of my hometown, not the town I live in, catching up with Facebook (yeah, sorry) and reading my favorite blogs.One of my favorite blogs is Old Centennial Farmhouse.  Today Joni, the owner of the blog, asked where we were on that morning.  She then posts a very poignant account of what her day was like that fateful day that changed our lives forever. After reading her post, I wish I had journaled the events of that day and our feelings because Joni's post was so real and fresh and it brought back all those fears and moments of disbelief that I think we all harbor to this day to some extent.Even though I didn't journal it, I remember it quiet clearly.  It was a usual day in our house, the Hubs had left for work and DD was getting ready for her classes at college.  I was making tea and dishing up cereal.  Having grown up in the home of a news journalist we always had the tv or radio on listening to what had happened overnight and that morning was no different.  DD always turned on the Today show which I promptly changed over to a popular quilting show the minute she walked out the door.  That day was no different.  The older I get the harder I find it to take the news of the day before  I have had my first cup of caffeine.  So, the day proceeded like every other before -- DD left and I flipped the channel, got my tea and was lost in the beautiful world of fabric.It couldn't have been more than ten minutes after my daughter left than the phone rang and it was her telling me to put the tv back on the news (she knows me quite well) because something  horrible had happened.  I did and I thought I was watching a rebroadcast of the event when, in reality, I was watching the second plane fly through the building.  She continued to school and I watched.  A short time later I spoke to my son who was at work and he told me to tell his sister to come home.  They both attended a local commuter college that had a large, diverse population, many from the Middle East.  He said she really didn't need to be there so I got her on the phone and relayed the message.  It didn't  matter, she was on her way home already.  She was beyond upset.  It seems that when she walked to the parking lot after learning that the school  was being closed, she witnessed a group of Middle Eastern students throwing cndy and shouting in celebration of the mornings events.  Of course, by the time she got home, the Pentagon had been attacked and I was trying to locate my family in the DC area.  They were safe, my kids were safe, my husband was safe although his work day had dissolved into everybody sitting around a tv watching -- nothing was done.  We were safe -- but were we?  Would we ever feel safe again?  What had happened to our country?  What had happened to the world? As we went about our business, the empty skies were ominous.  We lived reasonably close to an air force base that can be viewed from a high spot behind it.  We took a little drive and it was disturbing how quiet it was.  We wondered why those fighter jets that called this air force base home weren't gassed up and ready to leave, to  avenge this attack on our very soul.  The quiet was deafening, like the end of the world.  We went home and waited.  It is now ten years later.  The person who masterminded this attack is swimming with the fishes -- a little anticlimactic, don't you think?  Do I feel safe?  No.  Do I feel like our innocence, if you will, was stripped away.  Absolutely.  Growing up after World War 2, in the middle of the cold war when we would have disaster drills and sit under our school desks and cover our heads as we were crouched in the hallway, never did I feel as violated and threatened as I do now.  I lived in a town in south Texas that was home to five military bases and was a target during the Cuban missile crisis.  I know my parents felt the threat but I , as a child, did not.  I can't say that the children of today feel that secure in their lives anymore.  It is a sad reality but a reality it is.  The real reality is, however, that even though we may have lost our \"innocence\" we are still America and we will stand together and we will get through whatever comes our way.  We are strong and vigilant and intelligent. We are America and God bless us."},

I didn't realize this was a series and read one of the books sort of in the middle of the series.  It was stand alone, as they all are, but it is much nicer beginning at the beginning because they do build on each other. As far as what is next, it would be an obvious choice to read the third in the series but I might take a break and do something else.  Sitting on my bookshelf calling out to me each time I walk by is a copy of \"When the Light Goes Out\" by Larry McMurtry.  It is the sequel to \"Duane's Depressed\" which I haven't read.   Hmm..in reading the back of the book, it describes \"Duane's Depressed\" as \"one of McMurtry's most moving novels\" -- Texas Monthly.  So, maybe I shouldn't skip over that one -- I might miss something.  So, in answer to the question -- I am not sure but I will let you know!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, September 05, 2011", "text": "5 September 2011Well, it is time for another Musing Mondays over at Should Be Reading.  Today's topic is \"who do you think is the hottest male/female character from a book?\"I don't read historical romance -- you know, the books with the Fabio type guy and the cleavage spilling gal with masses of cascading hair on the cover.  So, I guess my answer is going to be a bit -- well -- old.When I was thinking about this question the first thing that came to my mind was Larry McMurtry's The Last Picture Show which I read well before the movie came out.  One of the book's main male characters was Duane Moore which coupled with the book's main female character, Jacy Burrows, was obviously the \"hot\" one because of, if for no other reason, his relationship with Jacy, the small town's racy, sexy and obviously only high school senior girl.  Ok, there was another girl and she was so NOT racy or sexy, even though she tried, that I can't even remember her name. As far as \"hot\" female characters, I guess I would have to say Jacy Burrows of the same book.  She was definitely portrayed as gorgeous, rich and bored which led her to try to cure her boredom in what ever way struck her fancy.There is another book, however, that I find the characters just as \"hot\" as  Duane and Jacy.  The book is A Woman of Substance by Barbara Taylor Bradford.  Even though the main female character, Emma Harte, seemed to be simple Welsh girl working as a domestic in a large manor house, she proved otherwise.  She was pretty but not gorgeous but she certainly had a way with men but learned early on what it was like to be hurt -- from that hurt, she learned to use that \"way\" for financial gain and independence.  The male character that I found to be \"hot\" was Blackie.  He worked in the manor house as well and loved Emma from afar, only able to be her best friend rather than the lover he would have preferred to have been.Even though these books took place in different locales and different time periods there were similarities such as unrequited love, illicit affairs, sadness, determination, insurmountable difficulties, illness, etc which, in my opinion, are all elements that will contribute to a character's \"hottness\"."},

I couldn't be more thrilled.  I used to dread winter -- still do considering our winters have become so icy the last few years -- but I really dread summer.  It has been so hot that it hasn't been safe for outdoor activity at all this season so I am really looking forward to this cool front that is ushering in autumn. I don't believe any rain is in our forecast even with all the tropical storm activity in the gulf but that is ok, I won't be greedy -- I will be more than content with the cooler temps.  We had a lovely get-together last night for our DD's birthday which is actually on Tuesday.  She had a couple of good friends join us and a good time was had by all -- Beanie really enjoyed herself although it was determined that my high chair is way too big for her and sort of swallows her up.  I might have to look at an alternative but as soon as I do, she will be out of it so I don't know if it is worth the effort or the expenditure.  We did miss our son and his family, though, but he was home with a migraine.  I will check on him later and see if he is better.The Hubs cooked kabobs -- beef and chicken and veggie for B our vegan friend.  I had rice and a large tossed salad.  Hubs also made a wonderful apple tarte tatin which he served with heavy cream.  Yum.  I made devils food cupcakes.  Trust me, his apple thing was much, much better than my mix made cupcakes. It proved to be a quiet afternoon except for the accidents.  In the course of thirty minutes a cabinet hinge gave way, Hubs dropped something and broke one of my canister lids and then he broke a coffee cup!  We made him sit down for the rest of the evening.  he is not usually so accident prone but I felt like he was on a roll and needed to be stopped!  And then came the back sliding part ----with every dish in the house dirty, I broke down and ran the dishwasher.  I was so sad that I didn't have the energy or the desire to stand there and wash all those dishes.  However, I used the normal wash cycle instead of the high temp cycle and I turned off the dry cycle so they dried on their own so I guess it wasn't a complete disaster.  I now remember why I don't like using the dishwasher -- my dw is across the room from where the dishes are kept and I don't especially like unloading a huge load of dishes.  It is much easier to unload the dish drainer on the counter and I prefer it so this mornings dishes were washed by hand and are happily drying right now -- in fact, they are probably already dry.  I guess I am back in the groove so to speak.I have been trying to complete a quilt I started -- a  disappearing nine patch -- and it just isn't going together well at all.  I thought this pattern would be a cinch -- there is nothing to it -- and I have made one before but if it isn't cut accurately, it is just a monster and that is what has happened with this one I am afraid.  So, I have been struggling with that declaring under my breath that I am never going to make another one of these again!  I also found a section of a quilt that I was hand piecing and I seriously think I am going to try that again.  The accuracy is unbelievable and I much prefer handwork over being hunched over the machine.  I am going to finish that one and see how it goes -- who knows, I might actually prefer it.So, it is labor day weekend -- the weekend I gave birth to my daughter -- very appropriate, don't you think?  I think the rest of this weekend I am going to rest, enjoy my tea outside in the cooler weather and just enjoy this wonderful change of season! Have a great weekend everybody!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, August 27, 2011", "text": "The Greening of Me -- It has been a long time coming.  I have been thinking a great deal about all things ecological for some time and have been working toward becoming a little more green, a little more frugal and a little more self-sufficient.  I have done a few things, here and there but nothing I could really \"see\" until now.I love to read blogs and have really been having a go at reading frugal, simple living blogs.  That is how I discovered two of my favorite blogs -- That British Woman and The Maple Syrup Mob.  These blogs are written by two lovely ladies with lots of interesting posts, great photos and really useful tips.  Their blogs have gone a long way to nudging me into the world of green. Them and this utterly deplorable weather we have been having.It is no surprise that Texas summers are hot, miserable and real energy expenders.  So, I decided that my goal this summer was to reduce our electric bill.  I had been mentally working up to this all spring, trying to figure out where I could make changes without turning off the air conditioning which wasn't going to happen.  Since the a/c wasn't an option, I decided to run the fans more and adjust the thermostat which I did.  I have also been making a HUGE concerted effort to turn off lights and unplug unnecessary appliances and chargers and things.  That hasn't been going too badly except that I have learned that my husband has a huge tendency to leave all the lights on in any room that he has even just walked through but that is another post -- the care, feeding and education of newly retired husbands.  Ugh.I digress.  So I looked at what I do use around here that are major energy suckers and the two elephants in the room are the dryer (electric) and the dishwasher.  So.......I bought this--and started drying my clothes on a line rather than in the dryer.  My mother-in-law declared me certifiable. Then, one day at Home Depot I discovered a close-out on a dryer like this --so I bought it.  It was marked down from $30 to $6! My towels fit on it very well because it expands and it fits in the bathtub beautifully.  After drying  several different brands of towels -- seems I have an obsessive thing about buying towels -- I learned that some really soft, organic cotton towels that I bought at Bed, Bath and Beyond dry incredibly fast and are really soft when I use some sort of fabric softening agent -- usually vinegar.  I learned something else, as well.  I prefer hanging the clothes to dry.  I suddenly don't feel like a slave to the laundry -- I do some each day, nothing is piling up, it gets dry without me having to stand over it and hang it up.  Yes, I have to iron but I did that anyway so nothing is new there.  I was really surprised to find out that I was actually enjoying myself.The next thing that I tackled was the dishwasher.  I hate hand washing dishes but decided to give it a go.  I mean, not everything went into the dishwasher anyway, something always had to be handwashed so why not just throw a few more things in the sink and be done.  My technique goes something like this --- scrape the dishes, stack them in the sink, squirt some soap in with them and fill the sink with the hottest water you can get out of the tap, turn off the light and go watch a movie.  When the movie is over, the water has cooled down enough to be manageable, do a quick wash and rinse (sometimes I fill the other side of the sink and sometimes I don't, depends on how much I have to rinse), place in the dishdrainer, cover with the dishtowel, turn off the light and watch Leno.  Much to my surprise, I am actually getting my entire kitchen cleaned each night.  Nothing piling up, nothing soaking over night, no mess to look at in the morning because it didn't all fit in the dishwasher.  Again, and very oddly, I am enjoying it.I think the reason I am enjoying it is because something is actually getting accomplished that I can actually see.  The laundry gets DONE -- completely! The dishes get DONE -- completely!  It feels good to see, at the end of the day, that something is finished.There is something else that I can see as well.  Today our electric bill came.  In the hottest part of the summer in what has to be the hottest state in the whole US, my electric bill was $20 less than it was last month! Not much, I realize, but to me it was.  I was validated! All my effort was rewarded with that little $20!  I was so pleased I was doing the happy dance! The Hubs sort of thought I was crazy -- for the dance, not the bill.  Little does he know that all it has done is make me want to do more, save more, be more self-sufficient. Thanks Jane and Gill! Now I am off to make more laundry soap!"},

I knew the \"high\" was going to be, inevitably, followed by a low so I would prefer to not have the \"high\".  As I have gotten older, I have learned to enjoy these sorts of days -- to savor them gives me something to get through the not so perfect days.It all began this morning.  I have typically always thought of Sunday as the end of the week rather than the beginning.  I have always felt like it was the end of the weekend, which of course it is, but I have always looked at it as the end of something instead of the beginning.  Today was different, though.  As I sat in church listening to an excellent sermon by our senior priest, it occurred to me that I was seeing things all wrong.  Sunday is the beginning of the  week,  a new beginning.  As Sunday goes, so goes the week.  It was an epiphany.  As I listened I looked around and realized how secure I feel in church.  I have always loved church and I have always needed church.   Today as I sat there soaking up all that was  going on around me -- the wiggly kids, the choir singing, the clergy in their robes and berettas -- the one thing that stuck with me was one line out of Father's message -- \"nothing is impossible with God\".  I needed to hear that.  The last few weeks have been jolting, mind boggling and emotion wrenching.  I needed to hear that sentence.  I am always amazed when the message seems to be intended just for me.  Have a wonderful week!"},

He was off to his new home!\r\rNobody said anything about being wrapped up!\r\r\rHelp! I can't breathe! Oh wait, yes I can!\rSo, after being wrapped lightly in tissue paper -- you can see the dubious look on his face in the first photo -- he was put into a secure gift bag --- big and roomy -- for his trip to his new home.  He got to ride in the car seat cradle in the back seat with Granny. Larry didn't realize that he was going to a party although he sort of got the idea as he listened to all the talking and laughing as he sat patiently waiting to be let out of his bag. The moment finally came and this is what he saw when he was introduced to his new home!

I guess I could look at that as providence -- it could have died in the grocery store parking lot.  I am trying for the half full glass here. I was also dealing with the fact that in one weeks time I would be doing more major dental work. So, the rest of the week was spent as I usually spend it -- laundry, cleaning, sewing -- nothing new here except trying to deal with all the drama that descended upon  me rather quickly.Well, here I am a week later.  The Hubs seems to be doing quite well -- he has been doing some yard work -- good exercise for him.  I looked at him today and he looked really good -- his face was lineless and he didn't have that tense, stressed look about him that had become the norm.  He was surveying all his gardening and he seemed ok -- no, more than ok.The car is in good working order and seems to like her new brakes and new battery.  Yes, my car is a girl.  If she had a name it would be -- well, I don't know what it would be -- so many possibilities.  Maybe Giselle.  Hm...I have to think about that.I, on the other hand, am not too happy.  I sat in the dentist chair for two hours as he drilled away a brand new crown, destroyed a relatively new crown and removed the tooth with the fractured root.  It was difficult.  I thought it would be easier but I was wrong.  It is sore and will be more so tomorrow but the thing that is really hurting is my tongue! Don't have a clue why but it is killing me and I am just not feeling well.  It makes me wish it was autumn and I could curl up in a nice, warm robe, dose myself up with something painkilling which I could do anyway but it isn't quite a nice without the nice, warm robe.  I would put a fire in the fireplace and just sit.  However, it is 103 outside so no fire and no robe.  A cup of tea would be nice but ice water is more appropriate.  So, here I sit -- not at all happy but I am sure things will get better.  The last time I did all this dental work -- about six weeks ago -- I lived off chocolate malts but I am going to try to do better this time.  Chocolate malts don't really fill you up, just out.On a different note, however, there is much news out of Texas this week.  Glenn Beck is moving here and starting a new television station.   I know, I know, but I like Glenn Beck.  I don't always agree with him and don't always listen to his radio program but I find him to be entertaining.  Who knows, I might even run into him say at Home Depot or someplace.  After all, he is moving close to my daughters neighborhood.   In more disturbing news, rumor has it that Casey Anthony might move to Texas.  Disturbing.  Very Disturbing.  And...Texas is fighting for the lowly incandescent light bulbs.  Actually, Texas is fighting against what it sees as too much Federal Government intervention into our lives.  We will see how that works out.  Could create jobs if we open up a bunch of light bulb factories.  Who knows what turn it could take. So, with that I am going to make that cup of tea, put on a nice, summer duster and curl up with my book \"Franny and Zooey\" and read.  After another dose of Advil and a good night's sleep I think I might be ready to get back into the business of life."},

Wow, that sounds like a challenge.  I digress.I would naturally assume that  my childhood library was the smallest but I have no idea how many books I had.  I will say that my mother had to get my grandfather to build bookshelves on one wall of my room to hold them.  We were big fans of books clubs -- The Best In Children's Books and Nancy Drew were two of them.  I still have many of those books and some that I inherited from JLSHall -- mostly Bobbsey Twin books.  I also liked the Honey Bunch books and have actually acquired a few more of those quite recently.  I still love children's books and I still buy them. So, that is about the size of it for my library -- haha!

{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, June 23, 2011", "text": "I Think I Will Come Back as a Pioneer --My Aunt Willie, while learning to drive and having a huge aversion to backing up, clung to her adage \"just keep going forward\".  I have always tried to live by her wise witticism but lately I feel like I am going backward more than forward and some days I feel like I have turned around and am running the other way.I guess there are several reasons for this -- my age, first and foremost.  I actually remember a time when things were different --- not necessarily better -- but different and as I am aging I am finding that I prefer that  \"other\"  time.  Our constant ability to access the media 24/7 is another.  I remember a time when all the news we got was the newspaper and the 10 o'clock news.  Of course, there was the radio but that was mostly the Top 40 -- the constant blaring of \"evil\" rock and roll.  Now, however, we are bombarded with the the news of the day -- wars, rumors of wars,  and everything -- EVERYTHING -- that is wrong with the planet and our life on it.  Basically, what I am hearing on a daily basis is how toxic our lives are.  Is this true?  Is it a media fabrication to evoke some sort of change in us and our behavior to affect some sort of governmental result?  As my husband says, \"at our ages, does it really matter if we eat vegetables from BPA coated cans\"?  Well, I don't know but what I do know is that I am tired of being confused about my existence.  Do the things I do in my day to day life really affect the planet, my health, the health of my family SO negatively?  I don't think we will ever know the answer to that question.As I have become more and more uncomfortable with the reports of the toxicity of our lives I have been trying to change things on a personal basis and I have been doing a lot of thinking about my life as a child, how things were done and how people lived.  I have tried to implement little changes so as to NOT freak out the Hubs too much lest he think I am ready for the little \"home\" with less stress.One of the things I have done is made a huge effort to de-plasticize the house.  I have done a pretty good job of it with the exception of zip-lock bags.  For some reason, I can't get the Hubs to wrap his lunch in waxed paper and the thought of carrying a lunch box/bag that you have to carry home is beyond his realm of acceptance.  He can tell me how his mom used to wrap his 2 pennies for milk at lunch (clue as to his age!) in waxed paper but I am not sure the man realizes that waxed paper is still being manufactured even though I have several varieties in the house.  As a result I have been having great fun buying pyrex even though the modern stuff has plastic lids it is still an improvement but I prefer to buy the old stuff at the antique store -- the stuff with the glass lids and it costs a pretty penny but it is great.In my attempt to turn \"green\", I have been buying more natural products.  I use this to wash my hair and my husband uses it to shave with.  He says it makes his face soft.  It does.It doesn't give my hair the ummph (sp?) that the volumizing shampoos do but it squeaky clean and it doesn't strip out all the natural oil.  I tend to buy \"green\" cleaning products but I am moving away from that as well.  From many blogs and comments, I am learning how to make \"natural\" cleaning products that work well and are less destructive to the environment and will actually cost less in the long run.I use a homemade \"soft scrub\" product that I learned of from a friend, Alicia.  It is a mixture of                      1/2 cup baking soda                       liquid castile soap (Dr. Bronner's)                       1 tsp. food grade vegetable glycerinThe process is that you mix the baking soda with enough soap to make it pasty -- it doesn't take a whole lot -- and then you mix the glycerin in it and put it in a nice, wide mouth jelly jar with the cute gingham lid.Works great and looks good if you leave it out next to the sink.  The product is more than acceptable (the scrub, not the jelly) and it makes my sinks shine!!So, a couple of weeks ago, I decided to research laundry soap.  I have been using All Free and Clear for my HE machine.  I would prefer a powder since I have the machines that sit up on the drawers for storage and the bottles don't fit in the drawers which sort of defeats the purpose.  So, I tried 7th Generation laundry powder and, while it was ok, I wasn't thrilled.  Can't tell you why, just wasn't thrilled.  I bought another brand of \"green\" soap called \"Charlie's Soap\".I haven't tried it but I am sure I will.  It is almost like my new concoction except that it comes in a big, plastic tub which sort of goes against my \"no plastic, not in MY house\" rule.  So....to cut to the chase (a little late for that, I suspect) I have been making my own laundry detergent.  The recipe called for Fels Naptha soap which I wasn't feeling too good about -- but it also said to use Ivory or basically whatever you bathe with -- that way you will know there aren't any allergies.  If you use a body wash, yeah, this won't work.  Gotta go back to bar soap.  So, here is what I used.The recipe is:                1 cup grated soap                 1/2 cup washing soda                 1/2 cup borax                  Combine -- use 1 T for small load, 2 T for large                  I also use white vinegar in my fabric softener well in the machine.Ready to grate the soap -- no special equipment needed!Grating soap is fun! And easy!Voila!  Laundry Soap! Yes, that is a plastic spoon -- recycling!This recipe makes 1 1/2 cups of laundry soap and I can honestly say it goes a long way.  I have washed quite a few loads and I am still not out although I will be making more today.  I have also replaced all the liquid soap in the bathrooms with bar soap -- Dr. Bronner's -- and I did handwash a load of dishes this morning with the same bar soap.  So, all in all, I feel pretty good about what I am doing and I sort of feel, for a moment, that I have slipped back in time a bit.  All these soap suds are blocking out the work outside and I feel like I am living in a much safe environment.Jumping off the soap box now.And the question is --- what, if any, kind of music do you listen to when you're reading?And the answer is -- none!  I usually have the television on or nothing at all.  I prefer nothing at all but in the evening, that isn't the case around here.  I have tried listening to internet radio while reading but it doesn't work so well because I tend to fiddle around with the radio instead of reading!"},

Boyett, was born in Sabine County, Texas in 1898 to Robert E and Clarissa Abi Conn Boyett.  Even though I didn't have him in my life long and I didn't see him on a day to day basis, I adored him and I do have memories of him.  I remember the last Christmas I had with him -- he bought Marla and I big pandas and I got a tricycle.  The one memory that I have that is clear as day is of him laying on my bedroom floor coloring with me.  I swore I was going to keep that picture forever but it somehow got lost -- but I remember it and that is what counts.  He was affectionate and wasn't shy about planting big, sloppy kisses and giving big bear hugs. How I wish I could ask him questions about his life -- ah, the plight of all family historians.James William Davis  1896-1969My grandfather, James W Davis was born in 1896 in Scranton Pennsylvania to James W. Davies, Sr and Dinah Sophia Webb Davies, Welsh immigrants who came to the US a mere six years before my grandfather was born.  Short in stature and gruff in nature, my grandfather -- PaPa -- wasn't one to be outwardly affectionate with his five granddaughters but there was never any doubt that he loved us. I didn't cross him (don't slam that door again, Melissa) but he was a mainstay in my life.  I remember so  many snacks of Welsh rarebit that I would share with him at the little kitchen table (which I still have) and listened to him give me good advice and lessons.  I particularly remember one morning following him around the back yard helping him pick up pecans.  He was picking them up but I was busy re-planting them in the flower beds.  They were still coming up, from time to time, when I was grown.  He was stable and dependable and we always knew that if we ever needed him, he would be there.  He may grump about it, but he would be there.Allen BrinkleyAllen Brinkley, born in 1947 in San Antonio, Texas to James Otis Brinkley and Helen Marguerite Bordovsky. He was my high school sweetheart, soulmate, love of my life, my rock and the father of my two precious children, Brandon and Brianna.  Oh yes, and the best grocery checker HEB ever had!  Allen has never failed me or the children, he is strong, determined, deliberate and always there for us.  I couldn't have asked for a better father for my children or husband for myself.Brandon BrinkleyMy son -- handsome, caring, compassionate, kinda goofy sometimes in a good way, strong in his faith and  the joy of my life.  It is an indescribable feeling to watch your son become a father.  Watching him with his infants, I was transported back to his infancy and all the hopes and dreams I had for him.  I haven't been disappointed.  He grew up well and is everything I had hoped he would be.  He also gave me a wonderful gift in the persons of my precious grandson Nathan and granddaughter Kathryn and the opportunity to watch it all over again.  I do recognize that this is a high school photo but I was having a difficult time trying to find a more recent one that didn't include children, food, gift opening or something else distracting.  But trust me, he still has his hair and he looks pretty much the same.  Chris WilcoxChris Wilcox -- my son-in-law -- born in Hampshire, England to Chas and Barbara Wilcox. I couldn't have asked for a better husband for my daughter than Chris.  His quiet reserve is a perfect complement to her bubbly personality -- he is strong and calm and logical (stay calm and carry on!) and they have done well in forging their little family   --  which was, of course, made even better by the addition of our precious, sweet Caroline (yes, I know it is a song) in 2010.  Watching Chris with his  daughter  is really special - it is fun to watch this long, tall drink of water and this little Bean of a girl together -- of course, nobody has told him that he is tightly  wrapped around one tiny little finger but that is ok -- they are doing great just the way they are.So, these are the fathers in my life.  They all have a special place in my life and in my heart and they always will.  Happy Father's Day!"},

We had take out pizza from Rocco's -- our favorite, independent pizza place.It was lovely -- mushroom, black olive and carmelized onion.   Fantastic.  After dinner I got hubby all settled in to watch \"Die Hard 2\"  (I think).  It has Bruce Willis with hair so it was old but Hubs  was enjoying it.  I was enjoying the fact that it would be over for me to watch \"My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding\" which I find to be hilarious but rather sad.  I also had my big glass of iced tea waiting for me.I have been working on some Christmas stitchery for a couple of months now and my latest project was this piece by Little House Needleworks.However, when I began the project a few days ago I decided to make it smaller by using smaller gauge fabric -- 18 ct. to be exact -- but the only 18 ct. I had in the house was a lovely pale pink.  I thought it would be nice.  Well, I was wrong.  It was too pale and so last night, in mid-FNSI, I decided to start over on a more natural fabric. I was almost half done on the pink fabric but now I have only done the lettering and about an inch of the white lacy edging on the top.  I guess I will have my own Saturday Night Stitch In tonight!I have to admit that my first time participating in this group turned out to be a comedy of errors.  Not only did I decide to start over on the project, I had many failures with my equipment.  I couldn't see well while sitting in my usual chair -- I blocked my own light from my lovely but dim lamps so I had to move to the sofa which doesn't recline like my chair but is in better light.  Then, the clip-on light that I had on my Q-snap kept popping off and.....the phone kept ringing which meant that I had to keep putting everything down to answer the phone.  Now, a more organized soul would have simply put the phone next to the sofa but that would have required much more thought that I was apparently capable of last night.In spite of it all, though, I stitched through the movie, I stitched through the gypsies, I stitched though the change of fabric and I really enjoyed the idea that I planned to do this and gave myself permission to attend the \"event\" and didn't feel the least bit guilty about leaving other things undone! I will attend again in the future."},

My favorite venue is KLIF Dallas and that is where I heard the interview with Rita Cosby, radio talk show host.  Rita Cosby has written a book about her father entitled \"Quiet Hero: Secrets From My Fathers Past\".  It is about her father's imprisonment in a World War II POW camp, his freedom and his life after the war.  While growing up and being inquisitive, Rita would ask questions but be told that her father had a rough time growing up and they just didn't talk about it.  The family was estranged when her father just picked up and left one day and they lost touch.  Upon her mother's death, while she and her siblings were going through her mother's things, they happened upon an old suitcase that contained the remnants of her father's \"other life\" -- the one before he came to the US.  At that point, Cosby decided to find and reconnect with her father, which she did and the result of that reunion was this book.Listening to the author talk about her work was compelling.  She was so full of passion for this book and for her father.  I can't believe that a book written with that much feeling wouldn't be a good book so I went looking for it.  I went to all the local Barnes and Noble stores but it wasn't in stock so the store that I frequent has ordered it for me and for the store and I hope to have it next week.  I could probably find it as an e-book but I feel like this one should be read in a \"real\" book format."},
{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, June 16, 2011", "text": "Booking Through ThursdayWith the advent and growing popularity of ebooks, I'm seeing more and more articles about how much \"better\" they can be because they have the option to be interactive..videos, music, glossaries..all sorts of little extra goodies to help \"enhance\" your reading experience, rather like listening to the directors commentary on a DVD of your favorite movie.  How do you feel about that possibility?  Does it excite you in a cutting edge kind of way? Or does it chill you to the bone because that is not what reading is all about?I purchased a first generation Nook to help relieve my ever-bulging bookshelves because I cannot, apparently, do anything about my insane book shopping habits and library real estate in this house is at a premium.  My thought process was that if I bought an ebook and really, really liked it, I would purchase a hard copy (on sale or used) for my library.  This has generally worked for me except I am drawn like a moth to the candle to the sale tables at B&N and there just doesn't seem to be anything I can do about it.  At least they are on sale.  Whatever.  I digress.  In any event, I have never used any of the \"extras\" on the Nook except the word look up -- twice.  I have never listened to music on it, played games on it and the web browser is more trouble than it is worth.I also purchased a Nook Color to use as a tablet -- definitely not a reader because it doesn't have e-ink pages and it is like reading a computer screen and for those of us who like to read for hours on end -- that isn't really good.  I have tried to read on it and ended up with a dreadful headache and so much eye strain I thought my eyes were going to pop out of my head.  It is good for \"Angry Birds\" however.The new Simple Reader from Nook is, in my opinion, a great option for those who just want an e-reader to-----read! It is smaller, quite light weight and of a size that can be held easily or carried in a purse or bag without adding unnecessary weight.  The battery life is improved as well.  In this format, I just see the e-reader as another book -- a collection of books so to speak.Does the idea of e-readers \"chill me to the bone\"?  No, of course not because everybody's reading experience is different.  I do, however,  think of reading as an escape from a hectic, electronically charged world and while it sounds redundant to use an e-reader to escape our hectic world, I think that if it is used without all the added goodies, it is no different than a book except that you aren't going to have to buy more bookcases."},

HOWEVER I do have my moments of being caught up in books and have been known to read through dinner preparation time, in the car on the way to anywhere, and in the tub. As to what the last book I read that I couldn't put down was -- well, that is difficult because the last several books I have read have been page turners.  In the Company of Others by Jan Karon certainly comes to mind but I have also been really caught up in the Aunt Dimity series.  Right now I am reading Franny and Zooey and it is going quite slowly, not because it isn't good but because I have been really busy but I intend to spend time on it today.So, there you go -- not very interesting, eh?"},

Me -- not her.  I scored the cute hair cut AND the pierced ears -- the summer of '65 was great!Well, long story short (no pun intended), the short hair stayed.  I missed the long hair and even tried numerous times to  regrow it -- I mean, what was Mom going to do -- UNpierce my ears?  But, every time I got to the stage where it was a decision whether to cut the hair or cut my throat I opted for the hair so, for the last 46 years, I have worn my hair essentially the same way.  About eight years ago I decided to abandon the \"helmet head\", quit teasing it and opted for a less structured effect  -- much better for the North Texas wind -- but it was essentially the same.  It was about that time that I noticed a marked thinning of my locks -- mostly on the top.  I tried blaming it on my \"thyroid\" -- my scape goat for lots of things -- then I figured it was all the teasing for years -- distinct possibility.  Since my aunt has exactly the same hair I GUESS heredity could have something to do with it and -----my age. I don't want to go there, though.  I would say that the genetics part is what scares me the most -- can't do much about it and my dad's hair got really, really -- gone.  So, I started worrying about the thinning hair which is probably not doing much for it but I was still being \"mean\" to my hair with styling appliances and all.  Yesterday, while curling my dry, product-full hair with a very hot curling iron, I noticed a significant amount of hair stuck to my iron.  It scared the #%$ out of me.  So, when I went shopping at Central Market I decided to check out some new products, re-do my hair with gentler methods and see if I could go out in public with the results.I have been using this off and on for a while now.  It is so much different than regular shampoo and it feels good but every now and then I have to go back to shampoo but my hubby loves this bar shampoo all the time -- he even shaves with it now. It doesn't strip all the natural oil out of the hair and it makes my \"greys\" (actually, \"whites\" much more manageable. Then I decided that I needed something a little less industrial than my Matrix products that I have been using for years and years.  So, I decided to try this I used it just like I use my Salon Basics gel, it felt pretty much the same and I had the added joy of it costing about 50% of the stuff I had been using.  I was happy.So, I preceded to dry my hair with my blow dryer on cold -- yep, cold.  It took a long time even though I went to warm for a little bit and even high for a couple of minutes but I am thinking that all the heat isn't grand for my lame locks.  I was thinking of rolling it up on regular velco rollers -- the ones I had purchased brand new just a couple of months ago -- which I cannot find.  Of course.  I probably threw them away.  Or hid them.  Whatever, I can't find them so I went back to my curling iron and put it on the lowest setting -- I mean it was so low you couldn't even iron a wrinkle out of a ribbon with it but it did seem to add a bit of a boost to the limp, mouse like stuff on the top of my head.I was reasonably pleased and figured I could be seen by people in the current state but I decided to try another product that I purchased.Lavender and coconut should smell fabulous, right?  Yeah, not so much.  However, the product promises to add shine and luster.  I read the list of ingredients and I could pronounce them all, they all seemed pretty benign except for the chamomile that I seem to be allergic to but I decided to give it ago so I put some -- a little -- on my hands, rubbed them together and then just ran them through the hair and finger styled it again and went on my way -- I was really bored by then and needed to move on.  Fast forwarding to this morning.  I am not a daily shampooer -- never have been and never will be.  So, I fell out of bed, walked to the mirror, ran my fingers through my hair and was shocked -- it went back perfectly, was puffy, shiny and looked like I had just \"done\" it.  I couldn't believe it.  Now, trust me, I will never, ever win any hair awards -- just not in my DNA -- but I was completely impressed that it did what it did and I think I will keep my new products for a while -- at least while I am still looking for those lost curlers!"},

I used to read a lot in the car while waiting for kids to get out of school but that isn't applicable anymore. I have to say, though, that the place I read most is in my family room, in my favorite chair.  I can't read in bed anymore for some reason but almost any place else is fair game."},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, June 05, 2011", "text": "The Joy of Shoe Shopping ReturnsWhen you are cursed blessed with short, wide feet shoe shopping in regular venues is difficult at best, grueling more commonly.  So, I have learned to shop online.  It took me a long time to get into the online shopping arena but my first visit to zappos.com convinced me.  As I did more looking, I found that lots of shoe sellers had short, wide shoes online but you would never find them in the stores so I was thrilled. One of my favorite line shopping spots is zappos.com.  It was here that I found a nice pair of plain flats. Since I have arthritis in my knees and feet I have long since given up heels except on very special occasions so I need some plain flats that could be dressed up or down.  This is what I chose from Clarks--They are so comfortable and have worn so well that I ordered two more pair, another black and a nice tan.  With free shipping how could I not? And you know what? When they didn't have the tan in stock, they even searched their competitors for me and helped me locate them on another site! Who does that anymore.  The tan pair was found at onlineshoes.com.  They have the same perks like free shipping both ways and were very helpful.  The person I talked to on the phone while placing the order was very nice and we had a lovely conversation about the weather.  He even sent me a thank you note for my business and he drew me a cartoon of a tornado -- I think he was twelve.It is summer here in Texas and the one thing I can't stand is to have hot feet so I wear lots of sandals when I am forced to wear shoes at all.  So, I visited the Lands End site after receiving a catalogue and purchased these -- again in wides -- and I am very pleased with them -- so pleased in fact, that I bought them in three colors -- tan, tomato red and true navy.  I will be wearing the tomato red today.I know it sounds like an overkill, but when I find something that works I need to scoop it up because who knows if I will ever find it again, especially in shoes whose proportions match the box more than feet.Summer sandals require cute toes -- cute colorful toes.  Two weeks ago I gave myself a really nice pedicure which isn't easy with arthritic knees -- not bendy  at all -- but I managed and I thought the toesies looks great in this.It looked lovely and wore quite well.  However, it was time to change things up as I didn't want my toes to clash with my tomato red sandals so I have now changed it to this.Much calmer choice, I would say and, hopefully, not as difficult to remove as the brighter stuff. So, that was my shopping adventure of late.  I am so glad to be able to find shoes that work for me because hurting feet aren't very attractive when you are forced to walk like Yoda.  So, I am looking forward  to enjoying a comfortable, free-footed summer.Like a Bolt out of the BlueIt came to me suddenly -- like a bolt out of the blue -- a dream in the night if you will -- the reason why I am such an unsuccessful blogger.  I am \"too\" -- too random, too slow, too lazy, too unorganized -- to sum up, too boring.I read lots of blogs and add to (and subtract from) my blogroll on a regular basis.  I have lots of interests so I am always looking for blogs to read that mirror those interests.  I love quilting and needlework, I read constantly, I have not gotten into bird watching/feeding, I am sort of becoming interested in gardening and I like taking photos.  The only thing is that my  blog doesn't concentrate on one thing, it is a hodge podge of all sorts of things with no real direction.  The photo taking is another issue -- taking them is fine, getting them on the computer is another.  I don't seem to be able to remember how to download them from the card so I have a little cheat sheet that the Hubs gave me to help.  It just seems to be an effort.Most of the blogs I read are usually focused on one subject with lots of photos.  I guess I could start a blog for every subject but then I would have to deal with the \"too lazy\" aspect of my personality.  It seems that I have sunk into the \"meme-a-day\" sort of approach which does help with the consistency aspect but, come one, who really cares which I think about all those things and what word or group of words I can come up with to complete a thought.  Blah.So, I guess I am going to have to re-think the whole blog thing.  I really enjoy reading them, I do enjoy writing them, but I think I need to get out of this box to do my thinking and make more of an effort to take more photos....ah."},

A believer will just shake his/her head saying \"yes, that is what I believe\" and a non-believer might start questioning his stand on things.  Wherever you are, it is definitely a beautiful story."},

Yes, it got me past the slump and it taught me to never be without at least one book to read. Of course, these days, it is really easy to have a book with you at all times thanks to e-readers, computers, ipads, even iphones.  So, that is how I solved the problem."},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, April 25, 2011", "text": "25 April 2011I decided to participate in Musing Mondays hosted by MizB at Should Be Reading.  This weeks topic is \"Do the members of your family read?  Do you think it was passed down to you?  Who do you think influenced you?Yes, I come from a reading family.  My father, while not highly educated, was a very well read man.  He loved Egyptology -- he didn't read or tell me stories when I was small, he taught me Egyptian history.  I loved mummies!  He also loved religion, politics and sci-fi.  He taught me that anything you wanted to know was in books.My mother was a reader.  One of my earliest memories was of my mom reading the newspaper and me sitting on the sofa next to her asking what it was like to be able to know what it said.  I must have been very young when I asked her that because I knew how to read before I was in kindergarten.  As time went on, my mother came to love the library system and by the time my kids were old enough, they made weekly treks to the library bringing home bags of books.  She generally got through all of them before the two week due date arrived. My grandmother read so many library books that she had to put her initials in them so she could tell if she had read them and my aunt had a running list, by author, on a little spiral notebook that she carried in her purse.I have to say that my biggest influence in reading, after my parents, was my cousin, JLSHall.  She was my \"big sister\" and even though we behaved like siblings a lot of the time, I still wanted to do everything she did (still do, really) and I loved her books.  As a result, we generally got the same books for Christmas.  We would play \"school\" with me being the student and she being the teacher -- it was only right since she was in school and I wasn't and I really think that she is the one that taught me to read.  I don't remember a conscious effort on her part but I think that is how it happened since I could read before I went to school.  And, after all these years, I finally got my own copy of \"Star Girl\".  Reading was important to my husband and me so I made it a big part of raising my kids.  We always had books in the house, made trips to the local bookstores, bought books at school book fairs, went to the library, etc.  As a result, they are readers as well and both excelled in academics.  I hope that they would say that we were an influence on their interest in reading."},

Or stand alone books?Late with this, again, I realize but this has been a very busy week.  So, the question is, do I prefer series books or stand alone books?  Well, it depends -- cop out answer, I realize but it is true.If it is a good series, like the Mitford series, I love it because if the book is that good, I really hate to see it end.  However, if it is mediocre, or worse, it is a problem for me because I have a problem not finishing things and a bad series can be a real drag.For that same reason, I like stand alone books.  Sometimes, in series, they start out great and, like the movie that should have ended half an hour earlier, they sort of \"wear out their welcome\".  It is especially satisfying when the entire story can be told within one cover.  In the case of the Mitford series (I know, I know), the original story really needs to be told in multiple books.  However, Karon's new Fr. Tim series is stand alone.  Even though the second book subtly references the first, you don't have to have read the first to read the second.  With that said, however, if you haven't read the first, you will want to.So, I guess my answer to the question is -- both -- depends on the book, the topic, and the author."},

{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, February 24, 2011", "text": "Jumping on the Band Wagon -- My Ten Favorite MoviesFollowing the lead of Brianna over at LoneStarPrep, I am going to attempt to list my ten favorite movies.  This is difficult for me because my family has always been \"into\" movies.  I remember going to the drive-in with my parents at a very young age and I even remember being collected from school and driven back to the movie theater where my folks were enjoying a late afternoon matinee.  My cousin and I were movie buffs, bought all the movie magazines and would sit through our favorites multiple times -- \"Westside Story\" and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" both come to mind as well as \"The Longest Day\".  So, since I am of a certain \"vintage\" and can safely say I have seen many, many movies, it is going to be difficult to name just ten but I will make an effort.  Please note that these are in no particular order except the order they popped into my head.I went to see \"The Haunting\" with my friend Sarabeth when I was in junior high school.  I have to say it was the scariest thing I had ever seen.  When you see it in the theater, it is completely different than when you see it on tv and completely different than the new version with Liam Neeson.  Although I am quite fond of Liam, I didn't like his version of this movie.What can I say about West Side Story?  I saw this movie multiple times when it was first released and I never miss the chance to watch it on tv even though I own a copy of it.  This is the movie that we bought the soundtrack to, learned all the lyrics (I can still remember them) and we all wanted to be Natalie Wood and we all loved Russ Tamblyn.  There is no intro like the one to West Side Story, it still send chills up my spine to see those colors change and art fade to reality.  I think I will watch it tonight.\"Imitation of Life\"  was a fantastic movie that covered so many topics and it did it with sensitivity and grace.  It is a rare movie that can deal with divorce, unwed mothers, domestic violence, rejection, and neglect without scaring the child in the audience! I loved this movie and still watch it everytime I run across it and yes, I still cry.I guess \"The Bells of St. Mary's\" has to be my all time favorite movie.  When I was a child, after we had Christmas Eve celebrations with my family, I would watch this movie and then midnight Mass.  I was a pain in Santa's patootie because I just would NEVER go to bed on Christmas eve until my viewing had been completed.  This was very strange behavior for a non-Catholic child but after watching this  movie for a few years, I toyed with the idea of being a nun.  More odd behavior from a non-Catholic child but Ingrid Bergman was just so gorgeous and I thought it would be great to be Ingrid Bergman.  Of course, none of that happened but I still watch the movie every Christmas and still get teary eyed and still think Ingrid Bergman was gorgeous.Next to \"The Haunting\", \"Bunny Lake is Missing\" has to be the most frightening movie! Black and white movies just lend themselves to this genre.  My hubby, when he was still my boyfriend, and I sat out for our usual Saturday night movie date.  We had scoured the paper and decided on something but when we got there, what we went to see was being replaced with a \"sneak preview\" and this was the movie.  I was disappointed at first but once it started I was entralled.  In fact, some of the best movies I have seen were \"sneak previews\".I am from Texas.  My father dabbled in film making and ran with the local film making crowd, most of which was involved in making this movie.  The soundtrack is fantastic.  I watch it just to listen to the music.  It reminds me of my dad and it makes me cry. The Hubs and I saw this movie not long after we were married.  It was a strange movie -- plot within a plot sort of thing.  This is the first I had heard of Meryl Streep but I thought she was one of the best actresses of my generation I had ever seen.  You have to watch closely to follow it but it is worth watching.Oh, how I loved the musicals of my youth.  \"Funny Girl\" is no exception.  The Hubs, while still the BF, sat through this more than once and endured the soundtrack numerous times.  It might not have been such a trial if I hadn't insisted on singing along.  I still enjoy this movie and the sequel \"Funny Lady\" is probably the only sequel I have really liked.I first saw  \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" when I was about 14 years old.  What can I say -- about the saddest thing  I have ever seen.  I am still moved when I watch it.\"The Dungeon of Harrow\" -- probably the worst movie in the history of the cinema (well, next to \"Bucket of Blood\") but, my father -- the one who dabbled in film making -- made it.  It was made in San Antonio, Texas and the surrounding areas.  The budget was like zero.  The acting pretty much the same as the budget but it is my Daddy's movie and still watch it and remember all the work he put into making it.  It was fun for me and I was glad to have the opportunity to be a part of it but....it is still a really bad movie.So, those are probably my ten all time favorites -- the ones I would watch over and over.  Even though they are from my youth, I have many favorites that are more contemporary.  I love almost anything with Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, and Meg Ryan.  I love contemporary romantic comedy and I always enjoy the British offerings.  \"Titanic\" is a favorite way to spend time and I am always up for a good mystery.  So, you see, it is pretty near impossible for me to pinpoint a favorite  -- I guess once a movie lover always a movie lover.Booking Through ThursdayAll other things being equal -- do  you prefer used books?  Or new books? (The physical specimen, that is, not the title.)  Does your preference differentiate between a standard kind of used book, and a pristine, leather bound copy.Well, this does require a bit of thought, doesn't it.  Do I prefer used books?  It depends.  If I am looking for a title that is out of print I obviously  have to prefer it used, don't I?  In that case, I would go for a hard back copy.  The most recent purchase of this type has been The Bumper Book, a children's book from my youth that I have bought copies of for my grandchildren.  Both copies that I have bought have been a bit worn and a bit musty but very tight and intact and I was pleased with my purchase except for the ridiculous price tag that was on them.   I guess I would say that for current reading I prefer new books.  I like the larger paperbacks over the standard paperbacks but, above all, I prefer hardbacks.  I go against all decor suggestions and leave the dust jackets on them because I like to look at them -- remember, I am the one who chooses books by their covers -- not a great idea but my style, for sure. This then brings us to the question of e-books, doesn't it?  Can't leave that new technology out of this conversation, can we?  I have an e-reader that I have a love/hate relationship with.  However, after the latest updates, our relationship seems to be mellowing out and we are working much better together.  The idea behind me wanting an e-reader is my inability to quit buying books.  We have run out of room in our house.    We have no more bookshelf space and no more wall space to put more bookshelves so something had to be done besides purging all the books.  I have begun purging some of the books and I have made the decision  that almost all new books will be bought for the e-reader and if I want to a hard copy to add to  the library here I will but I will no longer  enter a bookstore glazed-eyed, without direction, and run willy-nilly past the bargain bins to the new releases gathering up enough books to run a small lending library.So, in my case, I guess there are no hard and fast rules as to my preferences.  It depends on the situation, the price and the importance."},

{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, February 19, 2011", "text": "A Piggly Wiggly Wedding by Robert DalbyI just completed \"A Piggly Wiggly Wedding\" by Robert Dalby.  I had used this book as a Tuesday Teaser a while back.  I used to read books like this when I was younger and enjoyed lighter reading and it has been a while since I had enjoyed something of this nature.  It took me longer to read it than it should have but I don't seem to stay with my reading like I used to. At any rate, it is  a light- hearted book about Gaylie Girl Lyons and Hale Dunbar Jr. -- a middle age+ couple who had been a couple as teenagers, had gone their separate ways, had separate lives and came together again after the death of Gaylie Girl's husband.   The book takes place in the little town of Second Creek, Mississippi.  It begins as Gaylie Girl arrives and takes up residence just prior to her wedding to Mayor Dunbar.  She is introduced to the Nitwitts -- the ladies group of the town and is embraced with open arms and becomes an active  member of the group.  Sound dull?  Think of \"Golden Girls\" doubled.  Gaylie Girl has a wonderful future ahead with a wonderful man, she is going to be the First Lady of Second Creek and she is going to be renovating a vintage home -- but her euphoria is squashed by her two children from her previous marriage who are not at all excited about the prospect of a step-father in a town called Second Creek.  After all, their mother had been the wife of a very wealthy, prominent businessman in Santa Fe -- how could she be happy and....what about their inheritance.  In the end it all works out but the children create the conflict in the story.  As in many \"small town\" books, the residents of the town make up the colorful characterization and I think my favorite was Whittsie.  You will have to read for yourself to see why.  It is so interesting to see how the residents of a small community work to bring culture and sophistication to their lives and these characters do just that in a big way.  There is nothing \"hickish\" about these folks, just charm all around.I would recommend this book for light reading.  It is pleasant, the conflict is not all that conflicting and it is humorous.  The descriptions are such that you can completely see this little town and put faces to the residents -- we have all had neighbors, friends or relatives just like these people -- universal characters.  It was a bit superficial, could have been deeper in areas but overall, a good read."},

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, February 04, 2011", "text": "Should We Revisit the Good Old Days?The last several days have been a bit unusual and more than a bit stressful here in North Texas.  Ice, snow, bitter temps, and the Super Bowl have given us more than a small amount of grief.  One of the hardest things to deal with was rolling black outs, intentionally designed to take the stress off the utility system.  It worked and nobody really lost power for huge amounts of time but we were asked to try to conserve which required us turning things off, unplugging, putting things on hold, like laundry.This made me think about what we used to do before technology took over our lives.  How did we accomplish things without electricity?  When I started making my mental list it was astounding how our use of electrical power has changed.One of the first things that came to mind was hair styling.  Now we use blow dryers and curling irons or straightening appliances.  When I was young we used dryers occasionally and it became popular to have lovely hooded models that were portable and you could talk on the phone while you dried your hair.  However, many times we just rolled our hair on curlers and let it dry.  It took a really long time for the Dippity Do to dry, though, but I think our hair was healthier.  I might try it again -- wonder where I can find some Dippity -Do?The way we wake up has changed a lot, too.  We used to use wind up alarm clocks that sometimes had glow in the dark hands so that you could see the time without turning on the light and they clanged like a fire bell with no snooze!  The only downside to these is that if you let them run down you had to call for the time to reset them.  They are guaranteed to wake up a stubborn teenager though -- ask my son!Our morning java was prepared differently as well.  While many people used electric percolators, they were pretty new.  People still used percolators and tea kettles that they heated on their gas stoves -- again, no electricity.Long before we were able to just slide a switch on our central heating, we heating our homes by turning on the natural gas jet to which a space heater like this one was hooked up to.  They were scary and probably not too safe but still, no electricity.We swept our floors with brooms instead of vacuuming and we read books instead of Nooks and Kindles which have to be plugged in to use.  We now read our newspapers on a computer, again electrified, and we are entertained by more and more electronic equipment every day.  We used to hang our clothes on a clothesline to dry instead of using a dryer and we sat outside on a hot summer evening to try to cool off.  Things were a LOT different then -- we actually knew our neighbors. Would I want to go back to the \"old days\"?  No.  I. Love. Technology.  But, I have to say that reverting back to some of these things -- namely the broom and hand washing the dishes--for a while was actually relaxing and  felt good.  It made me think of my mother and a time when life was simpler and not so hectic and chaotic.   In fact, it made me feel so good that I might actually employ some of the old ways of doing things.  Hair curlers come to  mind but I am going to have to think long and hard about Dippity - Do."},

Rollie!My Favorite BlogsHmm...that sounds like an old 50's television show  like  I Married a Witch or  I Remember Mama.  However, blogging is thoroughly modern and goes a long way to making our world even smaller.  It seems that blogging has replaced the cute little pink vinyl diaries of the 50's and probably even the multi-subject notebooks of the school crowd and possibly even the moleskine journals of the traditional academics.  It is sad, on one hand,  that pen, paper, penmanship, and all that goes along with writing has been replaced by a computer but, on the other hand, using a computer, ipad, itouch, ereader, whatever, to blog allows us to write on the go, write what we see, capture the moment, seize the opportunity...so on and so forth. I use the word \"diary\" synonymously with \"blog\" because that is what it is.  However,  when we think of a diary or a journal we think of something private  to be shared with only a select few, if anyone.  It is something to be hidden from parents, siblings, or anybody with prying eyes.  It is almost revered as it contains our most private thoughts put into words.  A blog differs in that it is public, for the most part and the ability to share photos opens up new worlds and new ideas.  Blogs allow knowledge to be imparted across the globe and friendships to be formed like pen pal lists of years gone by.  So,  while we mourn the lost art of letter writing, good penmanship, good spelling and the ability to find really nice stationery it is hard to not be taken in my the allure of all the lovely blogs available for us to read.  I have been reading blogs for quite some time now and I have acquired quite a blog roll on my own blog.  I do have my favorites, however and I would like to share them here.My Mark Designs  (http://mymarkdesigns.wordpress.com) is written by Monique Keylon, a needlework designer.  Her blog links to her website and her Etsy store.  There are loads of needlework posts as well as life events and photos.  I am always cheered when I visit her blog.Mary Kathryn has a fantastic blog at  http://marykathryn.wordpress.com.  She is also a needleworker and has a great online store called ehandcrafts.  You can link to the store from her site.  She includes lots of photos from the area she lives in and I have to say they are gorgeous -- nothing like reindeer strolling around a parking lot!Amanda S over at Amandas Adventures in Sewing (http://amandasadventuresinsewing.blogspot.com) is a great little blog for home sewers.  She is young, interesting, takes great photos of her projects and shows us that home sewing is still a viable activity. Plus, she is from my home town, San Antonio, Texas!The next few blogs take us away from the crafty side of things and more into the world of reading, thinking, ideas, religion and food -- tea to be exact.Joysweb (http://joysweb.blogspot.com) hosted by JLSHall is a blog full of all sorts of interesting things.  She is a book lover  and shares her favorites  with lively reviews.  She also shares photos of all sorts of things so when you visit her blog, you never know what sort of treat she has posted -- from her doll collection to interesting shadows to photos of her home, Alexandria, VA.  Her site links to several of her other blogs and to blogs that reflect her wide array of interests.Another spot for thought provoking posts is http://mlhalldotcom.blogspot.com.  Michael reviews classical literature, shares his thoughts on the cyberworld, his travels and his career.  Even though many of his posts are way beyond me, I love to read them because he is just so darn smart!Brandon's Notepad (http://brandonsnotepad.wordpress.com) is a blog by a young man  who has a wide variety of interests.  He delves into the cyberworld, shares his journey of faith through his Roman Catholic beliefs and, one recent post, he reviews various teas.  This young man doesn't blog enough for he has a lot to say.Last but not least is a new offering that promises to be very enlightening .  Lone Star Prep (http://lonestarprep.blogspot.com) is a new blog that reveals and reviews the preppy side of Texas.  I think this blog has huge potential as  it opens up the side of Texas that defies the stereotype.  The young woman hostessing the blog is off to a great start with a link to a shopping site that takes the reader across the state to visit a number of unique venues. I think that Lone Star Prep will give the world a glimpse of the depth of Texas -- it isn't all spurs and tumbleweeds!So, that is my list of my favorite blogs.  I hope that you will enjoy a few of them as well and will share the links with your friends, too.  And with that, I am going to go enjoy of the wonder of the sun shining through snow flurries and be thankful that I don't have to go out in the 50 mph winds.I have been pretty busy over the last several days.  I can't exactly say doing what but I haven't been reading too much -- except for some magazines.  So, I am still reading what I was reading last week but I will include a teaser anyway.This is from \"A Piggly Wiggly Wedding\" by Robert Dalby.\"It was ten past five at the Victorian Tea Room.  Vester Morrow was in the midst of overseeing the exclusive cocktail party he and the Nitwitts had planned as the first step in the evening's progressive dinner for Petey and Amanda.  Only customers held in such inestimable esteem by the veteran restaurateur could have convinced him to close down his pride and joy or an hour or so on a Saturday night -- prime time in Second Creek.\""},

Tim series.  I was thrilled.    I looked forward to being back in Mitford but this book took Fr. Tim out of Mitford and back to Holly Springs, the town of his childhood.  It was here he had to face the things of his youth that he needed to deal with -- it brought out a darker side to Fr. Tim.  There was a bit of a mystery involved -- a complete new direction from the Mitford Series.  Karon's writing was deeper, more emotional, more involved than her earlier works.  It was Karon -- just better. Her newest work \"In the Company of Other's\" just takes her writing to new heights.  It is actually a book within a book, with mystery and family turmoil and emotion abundant.  Without giving anything away, it starts with Fr. Tim and Cynthia taking a long planned and well-deserved trip to Ireland.  Of course, the unthinkable has to occur and their plans get changed not once but several times.  They are caught up in the lives of the family they are staying with and become a part of the family drama and part of the solution.  All of this while they are reading the journal of one Dr. O'Donnell.  I can't say more for it would give away the story but let it suffice to say that Karon outdid herself with this one.  Her writing is so rich and the web is so tangled that she has created a page turner that can't be put down!I am a slow reader but I really tried to pace myself on this one -- I didn't want it to end.  I was almost as teary eyed as Tim and Cynthia as they headed for their next adventure.  I hope there is another book.  And I hope it is soon."},

So, here goes my  entry for this week.  It is from \"In the Company of Others\" by Jan Karon.\"She drew his hand to her mouth and kissed it.  'So when we grow old--what shall we do besides people and books?' 'We are old,' he said, rueful.'  She turned over and buried her face in the pillow. 'Speak for yourself, sweetheart.'\"Page 212."},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, January 04, 2011", "text": "Happy New Year!Ok, so it is the 4th.  I am old, slow, and have been under the weather.  I digress.In my youth (I am a Boomer), I used to make resolutions and eat black eyed peas every December 31 until a couple of things happened.  I realized that by Jan. 2 I couldn't even remember the resolutions and instead of saying \"oh, I'll start tomorrow\" it turned into \"I'll start next year\".  It didn't take long to realize that there were some things I was NEVER going to start -- anytime.  So, over the course of the years, I sort of dropped the resolution exercise.  For a long time, I didn't do anything, until this year.This year I decided to do something new, a re-evaluation of sorts.  I am looking at things I do, think, feel and want and trying to figure out if I am doing the best thing, thinking things through, taking a second look at my feelings and trying to decide if the things I want are logical, necessary or just plain indulgent.  This little thought process is telling me quite a bit about myself.I guess I have been a bit nostalgic lately -- blame it on my age or the Christmas season but I have been thinking about my life growing up and how it has changed and wondering if it is really that much better or just different.I grew up in post-World War 2 housing as evidenced in the photos below.  Our neighborhood was made up of little two or three bedroom houses, none much over 1000 square feet, one bathroom and huge yards so the homeowners could obviously make additions to the house as they inevitably outgrew it.  Each house was white asbestos shingles with a colored roof and colored shutters or trim of some sort.  Mine was white with a blue roof and blue shutters.  JLSHall's was white with a green roof and a bit of heathered green asbestos shingles around the kitchen window which faced the street .  They all had one bathroom tiled in some sort of awkward color combination that generally matched the ceramic tile in the kitchen.  These houses were very sturdy, strong and unbelievably plain -- except for the faceted glass interior doorknobs that I still love.  I no longer live in post war housing, although the houses in these photos still stand and are still being lived in.  I now live in a \"European style\" home, current construction with a small yard.  It is wired for every conceivable electronic feature, it is tight with double paned everything and everything is color coordinated with a nice, warm earth tone -- everywhere.  It is low maintenance, Swiffer friendly with solid floors and washable surfaces everywhere.  Happy?  Sure but there are days when I really miss that little blue and white house with the blue and white kitchen and the blue and white bathroom and the little gas heater in the bathroom wall.  I miss that yard that seemed to go on forever, sprouting dandelions and the occasional bluebonnet every spring. I miss the screen doors that were latched high enough for little girls to be unable to reach. And I miss those class doorknobs.I guess all this tripping down memory lane has sort of brought me in touch with why I feel like I do about things.  I have now become my mother (or my Aunt Velma -- depending on the day and circumstance).  Looking at the old photos and thinking about my life then and now I have come to realize that I am getting old.  Things today seem so superficial and without meaning.  That little blue house was home -- it shielded me from the weather, it held memories of birthday parties, great Christmas's, it was my refuge through illness -- it was my safe haven. It was always there, always strong and I think today people are too transient, both physically and emotionally, and don't seem to cling to past to help them get through today -- no safe haven.  In this respect I am glad I am getting old.  I am glad I grew up in a time and place that the values and standards were different. I think I learned a lot by living during the time when people were thankful they survived a war, the \"boys\" came home, and they considered themselves fortunate to have a roof over their heads and a place they could build a family with strength and memories --happy times to get them through the rough times of life which we all have.  They didn't worry that the bathroom tile was an awkward color combo, they were just glad to have one. Could I go back to that sort of life? You betcha and I have thought many times if our life would be more relaxed if we did -- no HOA to control what we put in our back yard, no gate to hide behind -- but it would only be in my mind because the world has changed and I have obviously not changed with it.  I am idealistic and will probably always be that way.  The way I view things today is obviously a throw back from a previous generation, an older generation when things were different.  This is why I aggravate the young women in my life -- I view things from a different perspective.  I don't know how to remedy that and don't really know that I care to try -- in 30 years they will be sitting in my seat annoying the young women in their lives -- I think it is a rite of passage.  So, after that lengthy rant, I have come to the conclusion that I will not try to be part of the young generation today -- I am ok with getting older -- thankful that I am here to get older and I will enjoy watching these young people muddle through like we did and learn on their own.  I will make an effort to not \"share\" so much but I will not try to change myself or my experience to please others.  If I am ok with me then that is good enough.Another thing I am trying to do is take a closer look at the things I do.  This sort of goes along with the acceptance of my generation because I don't think everything we did is of no use today and I don't think that today's ways are necessarily the best.  I have found that I am returning to the \"old\" ways of doing things like using more natural products for cleaning.  I am not fond of chemicals in any form and I am trying to make my home more like the one I grew up in.  I have started using, in earnest, more natural products.  For one,  I am really liking Seventh Generation Laundry Detergent.I have made soft scrub from friend Alicia's recipe.  This scrub uses baking soda, castile soap and glycerin.  So easy and the consistency is so nice.Our HOA won't allow us to have a clothes line and with all the pollen flying around most of the year that drives me crazy, an outdoor clothes line is not possible.  However, I am looking at an indoor drying rack which I think would work nicely for some things.I mean, do I really need to waste energy on drying cup/kitchen towels?  I really think I could be less wasteful in the energy department even though I use energy efficient appliances.  I don't know how the cat would feel about sharing his laundry room space with one of these -- who knows WHAT HE MIGHT DO -- but I think it is worth a try.Another area that I am taking a close look at is my time.  I have much I want to do -- a bucket list of sorts -- and many days I head to bed wondering why I haven't done much of what I wanted or needed to and trying to make an accounting of where my time has gone.  I have come to the conclusion that I have given too much of my time over to the Demon TV.  We have VOD, DVR, premium channels, netflix that we can get instantly over the Wii and we still can find nothing much to watch (except for the ever present football) and yet we keep the thing running non-stop just for the noise.  So, I decided to tackle the demon head on and turn it off.  I want to read and sew and do needlework --not just sit blindly getting a wider behind and farther behind  so I bought myself a little internet radio and turn it on for all the news/talk/music that the world has to offer.  And, I can listen to it as I do other things.  Cute, isn't it?The next thing that I am thinking about is \"things\". Anybody who knows me well knows that I am an electronics junkie.  It started when I got my first computer.  Now, don't get me wrong, I don't know how to really DO anything with all these electronics but I love the concepts.  I use my computer for many other things than email although banking online has not caught on, and probably never will, in our house.  I love to read blogs and I like blogging although I don't have too many followers and I never have much to say.  I like GPS systems, digital cameras, little video cameras, smart phones -- everything that gets me on the \"information highway\".  I don't possess all these items but I love them like they are my own.  So, I will be honest, my next secret desire, to be \"outted\" here, is an ipad.  I don't know why I want one.  I wouldn't get the 3G one because I don't really want another data plan to worry about.  I would have to buy a Windows computer to make it work.  It is something else to hand to the hubby to fix when it quits working or glitches.  Why do I want this thing?  I have a nook, named Tinklepaw, that I have a love/hate relationship with (back to the old school concept of books -- actual paper smashed between two covers) so what is it that intrigues me about this thing.  I have no clue.  I keep  denying the desire.  I keep talking myself out of it and probably will again but it keeps cropping up.  Do I need this \"thing\".  No.  Will it make me do anything better or more efficiently?  No.  Will it make me money? Uh, decidedly not.  Will it make me a better person?  Can't see how.  So, how will this latest obsession pan out? I don't know -- the year is young.So, as you can see from my little rant here, I am not making resolutions.  My New Year's Re-evaluation is going to be an ongoing thing throughout the year.  I will try to share my new ideas here, what works well, what doesn't (i.e. cat with drying rack).  I think it will be an interesting year.  Oh, I feel a little like Ed Begley --- that can't be good!Happy New Year from Melissa who is beginning to feel like an old hippie -- maybe I should sew a peasant skirt? Oh, about the black-eyed peas -- the last year we had them my mother didn't want to mess with it but my Aunt Linnie said we had to have them -- good luck and all.  Well, we had them and our house burned down.  We never had them again.  Ever."},

Long gone are the days of sneaking around, wrapping presents and hiding things -- we now go for practical things and we don't see much reason to waste all that wrapping paper.  So, today was our day. The hubs did his shopping at Woodcraft where he bought a couple of hand tools for woodworking.  I had ordered him a pocket knife that he wanted but it is on back order so he won't be getting it for a little while but that was ok.My shopping was done at William--Sonoma where I bagged these--The color, Ocean, is really pretty and I just love Le Creuset so I am happy! So, Merry Christmas, everybody and I am going to go  cook something!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, December 08, 2010", "text": "It was Thirty Years Ago TodayI am a baby boomer.  I \"grew up\" during the decade between 1960 and 1970.  Even though my parents say that the 1940's were the best time to live, I know that the 60's were, without a doubt,  the most exciting time  to be a younger person albeit not the safest.It was 1963 or 64 when the Beatles took the US by storm.  I was taking ballroom dance lessons at Bette and Glen Dance Studio when \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" was released.  I remember the guy who had my interest at the moment telling me it was the \"dirtiest\" song he had ever heard.  Ha! We were just coming out of the 50\"s -- no songs were dirty.  Since this was well before the advent of cable , satellite or the internet we had to rely on Ed Sullivan and movie and teen magazines to keep us up on what was happening on the entertainment scene.  We did ok, though, with our precursors to the ipod (called a transistor radio) glued to our ears we would spend hours at the magazine stand at the grocery store reading every article on whoever was catching our eye at the moment only taking out a bit of time to flirt with the package boys.I wasn't a Beatlemaniac.  I didn't have a favorite although I guess I gravitated toward Paul -- \"the cute one\".  It was really interesting, however, to be able to see and hear young people from another country doing the same things that we did here.  I bought the records, saved the magazines and got all caught up in the British Invasion (especially the clothes) but I never lost interest in our homegrown groups. Time moved on, The Beatles broke up, I grew up and that was that.  My interest was piqued again in 1969 when it was reported that Paul McCartney had died in a car accident three years prior and was replaced with a double.  This news was only of passing interest -- however, I now believe the story to be true.  In any event, not much thought was given to the Fab Four or any of my other favorite entertainers until 1977 when Elvis Presley passed away at the age of 42 -- absolutely ancient to my 27 years.  I cried and tried to explain to my two year old what was wrong.  He didn't get it. He didn't get it in 1980 when I cried again on December 8 when a special news report broke into regularly scheduled programming to announce the murder of John Lennon at his home at the Dakota Apartments in NYC.  Suddenly the years melted away and I was 13 again listening to the \"dirtiest song\" ever.  This couldn't be -- not only couldn't John be 40 years old he certainly couldn't be dead -- especially at the hand of another.  The next day or so I sent my dear, long suffering hubby out in an ice storm to buy a copy of \"Double Fantasy\" -- I hadn't bought an album in forever -- and I was quite taken aback.  It was great - - well most of it anyway - pick up a copy and you will know what I mean.  I hadn't seen a photo of Lennon in a while and was surprised that he had aged nicelyand he still looked like himself, unlike Paul. There was lots of talk about him turning into a house husband and being a has-been but the album proved that as he aged he mellowed but he was still capable of producing fantastic music but, sadly, there would be no more.Lately I have had a renewed interest in the Beatles and have done some reading and movie watching -- \"A Hard Day's Night\" to be exact, which I had never seen before.  I have watched some documentaries leading up to today and see this group in a whole new light.  Of course, I guess my aging has skewed my viewpoint as well.  They were a great little group that possessed a lot of talent and I am proud that they were part of my generation. Rest in peace, John and yes, we are all still trying to imagine."},

It is the pub that my daughter's family goes to all the time.   I believe the name is The George and Dragon.  It was a cozy little (well, not really all that little) place where I had this lovely chicken and mushroom dish --- no photo.  I do, however, have a photo of what my husband ate -- he didn't manage the whole thing and ended up sharing which made everybody happy but it made a great photo!Well, this was my experiment to see if I could do photos again on this blog and it appears that I can so I may be posting here more often."},

I don't know that it was such a bad book, it just wasn't for me.Ok, more tomorrow -- wow, this is a very long meme.Booking Through ThursdayI haven't done a BTT for a long time and, of course, when I visited today I found this super long questionnaire.  I will try.  It might take a couple of edits.  Ok, here goes.1.  Favorite children's book -- The Bumper Book -- a compilation of stories and poems2.  What are you reading now? -- \"Mennonite in a Little Black Dress\"3.  What books do you have on request at the library?  None, they are planning on closing our neighborhood library which will leave this side of town without a library.4.  Bad book habit -- buying because I like the cover5.  What do you have currently have checked out of the library?  Nothing -- see #3.6.  Do you have an e-reader?  Or does it have me is really the question.  Quite a tempermental thing -- but yes, I do.7.  Do you prefer to read one book at a time or several at once?  One at a time -- I confuse easily.8.  Have your reading habits changed since you started a blog?  Not really except now I look at books and think about whether they are blogworthy!9.  Least favorite book you have read this year.  No doubt -- \"Bramwell Valley.10.   Favorite book you have read this year.  I have no idea -- I read so slowly that my readings can overlap years.11.  How often do you read out of your comfort zone?  What does this mean -- location or genre.  I never read out of my comfort zone on either.12.  What is your reading comfort zone?  Again -- my chair is my favorite place to read.  As to genre -- I like many things -- historical fiction, biography, current novel fare and how-to books involving my favorite things -- quilting and embroidery.13.  Can you read on a bus?  Don't know -- never tried.14.  Favorite place to read -- my chair, my house15.  What is your policy on book lending?  I lend books to a select few. Namely daughter and daughter in law16.  Do you ever dog ear books -- I try not to but I used to as a child17.  Do you ever write  in the margins of books?  Not when reading casually.18.  Not even with text books?  Well, of course, with text books but it was hard when having to chisel on the stone tablet.19.  What is your favorite language to read in?  Well, I prefer my native tongue which is American English but I can handle a good dose of British English as well. 20.  What makes you love books?  Ah, well, the love of reading was cultivated in me at an early age.  It began with a fascination of watching my mother read the newspaper and then watching my cousin read and get lost in her stories.  When I learned to read I was fascinated that books could take you to places you would probably never go and, if you didn't devour the book, you could stay in that place as long as you wanted and you could revisit without checking your luggage.  I love books that make me completely forget where I am when I am reading them.  Another place, another person, another life......and all for about $14.95 or a library card.Ok, I will publish this now and finish later."},

So, here goes --Melissa's Thoughts for the WeekIt is hotter in North Texas than South Texas -- who knew?I raised two really good kids and am so proud of them.Loved seeing all three of my grandkiddos together -- wonderful groupWas dreading DH's looming retirement but, on further review, maybe not.Is still not complaining about the dreadful weather but......Is realizing she is never going to be thin againIs accepting that she is ALWAYS going to fall asleep at 9 pm whether she is laying down or notI realizing that her love/hate relationship with her Nook is definitely leaning more to the \"hate\" side of things.And finally -- wonders when she is ever going to stop trying to get organized -- shouldn't I, at my advanced age, have already done that?"},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, July 26, 2010", "text": "Sleeping with BreadAfter visiting the meme site I found yesterday (http://thedailymeme.com) I discovered another suggested site for a Monday meme.  This is a different sort of meme -- not just another question/answer list so to speak.This meme is based on the Examen prayer.  The examen prayer follows the spiritual practice of St. Ignatius which involves examining the previous week and studying what brought you peace, strength, consolation and what brought you concern, weakness or desolation.  It is a very thought provoking practice and sets you to thinking about your impact on those and the world around you as well as their impact on you as well.In the past week, I think the thing that has brought me the most consolation is something diametrically opposed to what brought me the most desolation.  I listen to the news a lot -- I listen to mainstream media as  well as alternative media.  It all, in various degrees, is awful.  It is all doom and gloom and, as best as I can tell from what is reported, there is absolutely nothing of any good left on this planet.  The people are bad, the politics are bad, everything you eat is bad for you, we are becoming more obese and less productive, people can't find jobs.....and it goes on and on until you feel like you are at the bottom of a well with no way out and it is  flooding.And then...I look into the face of my newborn granddaughter.  As she lays in my daughter's arms, devouring the food in the bottle, she is  gazing at her mother with all the unconditional love and trust that only a child can possess.  She is dependent on her mother for everything -- the food she eats, the clothes she wears and the love and nurturing that she needs to grow and thrive.I am reminded of another Child, the Christ child, that gazed at His mother in the same fashion.  I am reminded that we are taught to come to the Father as little children, with faith and trust and that He will take care of us.As I watch my daughter with her daughter I realize that there is still much goodness in the world.  There is hope and freshness and a brightness of future.  I look at this grandchild and see wisdom in her innocence and am again reminded that all we need is the faith, trust and belief of a little child."},

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, May 26, 2010", "text": "Bramwell ValleyI don't usually do book reviews.  I don't do them well so I leave that up to JLSHall.  However, I feel compelled to at least comment on my latest read.When I received my Nook in January, I decided that, it being first generation and all, I would try some of the \"free\" offerings before I sunk a lot of money into online books.  I think that was a prudent decision considering that I have had some issues with Tinklepaw Nook although some of those issues have been eliminated with the latest \"upgrade\".  I digress.The first \"free\" book that I downloaded was titled \"Bramwell Valley\".  The synopsis described it as a story about a quaint small town with colorful characters.  Right up my alley -- like \"Peyton Place\".  Hmm..yeah, not so much.This is a story of a small town called Bramwell Valley.  The main characters are four women who have a couple of things in common -- they are all wealthy and they have all inherited a bit of the witchy from their foremothers.  They aren't actually witches, as explained later, but rather sorcerers.  Ok, whatever.  Anyway, the  subplot revolves around Lucifer (fondly known as Lucy).  Lucy decides to resign as the devil, leave Hell, go to Florida, take up with an ancient crone in a hot body and drive a black hummer.  That is bad enough, in and of itself.  However, Lucy didn't tell anybody where he was going and, in an effort to find him, several demons decided to open THE DOOR and they all fell out of Hell into the earth where all sorts of havoc was unleashed.  After a number of \"events\", Lucy decided he had to return and take the demons back -- it was hard leaving the lady friend and the hummer -- not sure which one more.  In any event, all was well that ended well.  I guess.This book wasn't  intellectually funny.  No sophisticated humor, no innuendo -- just unadulterated silliness.  It was a real effort to finish it and I wouldn't recommend it.  I was just glad it was free.  Even then I felt like I had to finish it -- a personal issue of mine -- have to finish books I start -- regardless.  However, if you choose to delve into it -- be forewarned.  Unless you like devils driving hummers. Done here."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, April 14, 2010", "text": "The Enigma Known as FacebookSometime in late May will mark the anniversary of my high school graduation.  It will be 42 years since the night I left the Municipal Auditorium basement after dumping the rented cap and gown into the big box at the door.  I remember it well, the light blue linen dress was cool against the warm, humid breeze that whipped through my hair as I walked toward the front of the building to meet my family.  The feeling of freedom was intoxicating and the promise of the future was stimulating.  I didn't enjoy high school.  I didn't fit in but I cared, I tried but I wasn't true to myself.  But this particular night it didn't matter anymore -- this was a new beginning. I had THE BOYFRIEND and I had THE COLLEGE and life progressed.I never looked back.The boyfriend became the husband the college was replaced with a job I liked better and that was replaced with another job that I liked even more -- motherhood.  Finally, I was being true to myself.I never looked back.My life was made of up of all the trappings of babies and homemaking and I was finally in my element and time marched on and we grew, as a family, with it.I never looked back.Then, as a family, we entered the electronic age.  I remember my husband and my other little man spending hours on Saturdays at the computer store deciding on which model to buy and finally the day came when they brought one home.  We even had our own computer room -- a closet that once housed all the toys that were strewn all over our den.  There was no internet at the time and the fun was in learning DOS.  Well, I didn't find that fun -- I would stick to my bread baking and book reading and cross stitching, thank you very much.  The kids loved it.  After all, what four year old could resist the allure of KinderComp.Time went on and we moved to a different city and the kids, being in middle and high school were becoming computer savvy and I was becoming curious -- especially with the advent of the internet. My husband was no longer interested in DOS and, being on a computer most of the day at work, he really wasn't too interested in more of the same when he returned home.  Seemed like an appropriate time for me to jump in.  Kids went off to college and would talk to me about things they had seen or read on the internet -- I never even thought about it being a threat -- and I wanted to be a part of that world.So, one night, the best hubby in the world asked what I wanted to do after dinner and I didn't have an answer so he asked if I wanted to go get my computer.  I was ecstatic -- uh, yeah, I wanted to go get my computer! And, the next day, I wanted to get my internet access! And, I did.And I never looked back.Computerization of our home certainly came in handy.  The internet was a wonderful resource for my favorite hobby -- genealogy.  I was also helpful in my other pursuits like quilting and needlework.  It was great.  Then one day, my son mentioned Mundee's \"blog\".  What was that, I asked?  Speaking slowly so I was sure to understand he sounded out \"weblog\" and Mundee has one.  Well, I wanted one too.  I visited Mundee's blog and then other blogs dealing with my areas of interest and then I found out how to make a \"blog\" and I did.  Great fun and \"you are here\".And then....yep, you guessed it -- social websites emerged.  First it was myspace which I jumped into for a while but once Facebook came into existence, myspace was history for me.  I think I was one of the first people to sign up for Facebook and I didn't really \"get it\" but I was \"on it\" -- me and a bunch of teenagers. Over time, however, there were more and more \"older\" folks on there as well as groups and such.Suddenly, I discovered the girls of my elementary school class.  Not all at once, of course, and not all of them, but one by one a few emerged.  These are the same kids that I left behind that night of graduation.  I didn't know if I would ever see any of them again -- I didn't even think about it -- I just went forward and here I am, looking back.  There are a half a dozen or so of us that have created a virtual elementary school reunion.  We have talked about who we can't find, who we WON'T find, who we have lost.It is a  strange feeling -- could it really be 42 years since graduation?  I haven't seen these women in years -- yet we talk like it has been only a few months.  Have we changed?  Are we the same?  There are a lot of things from that time I can't remember and a lot of things I do and wish I didn't.  It has been fun, this virtual reunion, talking about where our lives have taken us.  Do I fit in?  Probably not but I am now, without a doubt, true to myself.So, at this point there are two questions.  What about the people we can't find but would like to.  Maybe they don't want to be found.  Being well versed in genealogy, I do know how to find people but I respect the fact that if people want to reconnect with their past they will join a social networking site, such as Facebook.  If they don't then it is safe to assume that they don't want to \"look back\".And, the second question is -- should we invite those elementary school boys to the reunion?  Hm...."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, April 12, 2010", "text": "Yesterday -- Sounds Like a SongI don't know what it was about yesterday.  It was the most awesome day I have had in a long time.  For one thing, nothing was wrong.  Well, except for the swollen eye compliments of The Building Project and The Pollen.  Other than that, a calm took over Brinkley Manor. I got up early and walked outside.  For the first time in weeks the air seemed clear.  It wasn't but it was better than it has been.  It was cool and very quiet. No banging of heavy equipment on rock, no concrete trucks with their barrels whirring, no people screaming in foreign tongues.  And, less dust.I visited my garden for the first time this spring.  Hubby did some gardening and washed the thick layer of dust off everything.  Futile, I know, because today the project will be back \"on\" again and by this afternoon the dust will be back, my nerves will be on edge from the banging that causes the house to vibrate, and the constant roar of trucks will be in high gear -- more concrete today.But, for a brief time, I was able to enjoy the peace that the garden was meant to bring.  It has been weeded, pruned and watered and awaits another visit next Sunday when all is quiet again.  While I wish I could somehow preserve this lovely spring we are having but  it seems it is going to be measured by Sunday visits.  Will that make it go slower or faster?  I am not sure.I am more than pleased with my awesome Sunday and my peaceful garden.  It was a contemplative sort of day which I haven't had in quite a while.  I was afforded the luxury to just sit and think about things, people, other times, how fortunate I am -- all those things that usually allude us or are taken for granted on a normal day.  I can already tell that my awesome day is going to affect the rest of my week in a positive way.  I am hoping to keep the spirit of my awesome day alive until next Sunday when I hope to have another.My awesome day ended as it began -- in peace.  My DOK meeting left me, once again, completely rejuvenated by the energy and power of the women of this group.  I have never seen anything like this group and it is hard to describe but when I am in their presence I can't be anything but uplifted.  I thank God that he has placed me, the least energetic and powerful of them all, in their group to reap the benefit of all they have to offer. I just hope that one day I will be able to give back in some small measure.My awesome day ended with a dinner invitation from daughter and son-in-law.  Palio's pizza, our new go-to pizza \"place\" was the restaurant of choice and, again, the peace and relaxation I felt was something that I hadn't felt in a long, long time.Why was I given this gift yesterday?  I have no idea.  But, I took it, no questions asked and call it a blessing."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, March 31, 2010", "text": "Rest in Peace Baby JuneYoung people today have a whole load of handsome vampires to swoon over, drop dead gorgeous \"mean girls\" to emulate and \"achy breaky\" daughters to hold up as role models. Special effects are common in today's movies as well as realistic storylines -- well, except for the vampires.  Girls of the 50's and 60's were different -- oh, we had our role models and our \"crushes\" (Russ Tamblyn comes to mind) but our cinematic satisfaction came in the form of the musical.Movies during that era (could I possibly have referred to my life as an ERA -- ouch!) were gorgeous, costume clad, bigger-than-life romances with fantastic scenery and happy endings.  Every ingenue could sing and tap dance her way through life's challenges and end up winning the guy and keeping her reputation in tact in the process.I don't know too many girls who didn't want to \"wash that man right outta their hair\" or who didn't want to be one of those seven brides for one of those seven brothers (again, Russ Tamblyn comes to mind).  The beauty of the Asian culture was depicted in \"Flower Drum Song\" -- who didn't just melt watching Nancy Kwan dance and who didn't just love the innocence of Miyoshi Umeki.  It didn't matter if you were the \"good girl\" or the showgirl, everybody fell for the bad boy in \"Guys and Dolls\".  I don't know one girl my age that didn't yearn to hang out on the fire escape and watch those tight-jeaned chorus boys dance their way through the West Side of New York telling their teenage angst Story. Did I mention Russ Tamblyn? I am sure that every girl my age secretly pictured herself dropping that shoulder strap and pulling off that glove in \"Gypsy\" even though, being the demure, innocent things that we were ( we WERE!) we wouldn't admit it.  What a life that movie depicted -- hard times, children working to support parents, sibling rivalry, the urge to \"get away\" and the determination to be somebody -- that is timeless and universal it would seem.So, the world has lost one of those glamorous performers in the person of June Havoc.  She was born Ellen Hovick sometime around 1912 (she didn't really know herself since her stage mom had lied about her age so much-- seems she had multiple birth certificates) in Vancouver, Canada.  When her parents divorced her mother took her girls on the road living the vaudeville life in an effort to support themselves and be in the limelight, something their mother, Rose Hovick, always wanted for herself -- talk about living vicariously through your kids. June was the talented sister with Louise taking a backseat.  Louise only came to her mother's notice when Baby June, as she was promoted, ran away to be married at age 13 .. or 14 ... or 15...whatever.  In order for the \"show\" to continue, Louise had to take over.  By that time, Louise was no longer a child but a young woman -- she couldn't carry on the \"Baby June\" persona so she had to move on to the next thing which was burlesque which involved baring a little skin.  After the initial shock and humiliation of this new act, Louise, now known as Gypsy Rose Lee, continued in this line of work the rest of her life.  It is well documented in the movie \"Gypsy\".  If you haven't seen it, which I can't imagine anybody on the planet not having seen it, rent it, get some popcorn and Kleenex and enjoy.That, however, wasn't the end of Baby June.  She married the boy she ran off with but the marriage didn't last. She moved to Hollywood in the late 40's and pursued an acting career that she would work in until as recently as 2003.  She was also a writer.  She passed away March 28, 2010 of natural causes at the age of 97."},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, March 30, 2010", "text": "Language -- Funny You Should Say ThatI was in school a long, long time ago when chalk boards were black not white, when girls wore dresses and boys pants rested at their waist not their knees.  I grew up doing homework having spelling tests, doing math problems at the kitchen table (evens one night, odds the next), I learned to write in longhand and I discovered great joy at doing book reports on books I took from the public library. I learned a lot in a seven hour school day with one teacher but one thing stays in my mind to this day and that was the declaration that the English language is difficult to learn -- lots of rules and exceptions to those rules -- lots of \"i's\" and \"e's\" and \"c's\".  We struggled to remember that \"receive\" isn't \"recieve\" and that \"there, their, and they're\" aren't even close to the same thing.  We learned \"principles\" and were sure we didn't want to have to visit the \"principal\".  It was fun, it was hard and we learned.The present generation is having it's own problem with the introduction of texting language.  Why spell out \"laughing out loud\" when LOL will do and EVERYBODY understands and can spell it -- I have never seen LOL mispelled.  Young people text like our generation talked on our pink or turquoise princess phones.  It has been reported that texting is replacing talking amongst tween and teens -- they prefer the \"written word\" -- the meaning of that debatable.  So, I guess it is no small wonder that the verbal communicative skills among the young adults is suffering.  Have you ever stood in a checkout line, making small talk with the young person behind the register and have he/she look at you like she doesn't understand a word you are saying?  They don't.  It is almost frightening to think that these non-communicative upstarts will be voting adults in the not too distant future.  This is a \"generational thing\" not unlike the \"generational thing\" of the 60's -- we don't understand, they didn't understand but we could read, spell and speak -- possibly too much and too loudly.But, I have to wonder what happens when dealing with a person of similar age -- why is there a breakdown in communication?  Why is it hard to follow direction?  How in the world does \"I like it very short in the back and close on the sides\" somehow translate into \"ah, let's give M a modified mullet -- yeah, that will work\".I guess next time I will have to text my preferences -- what is the code for \"short in back\"?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, March 29, 2010", "text": "Saturday Play DateSaturday was our play date with the g-kids.  They are growing up so fast and their personalities are developing rapidly.  One likes to make funny noises and the other gets tickled at it and imitates -- quite well, actually.  One like to build, the other wants to do the same.  They both love books and enjoy reading the same thing over and over.  Running is quite popular and time-out is routine.  One can count to eleven and say MOST of the alphabet -- the other is quite fascinated by socks.  One readily apologizes for any perceived misdoing and it usually involves a kiss.  The other loves to bump heads and rub noses.  Their vocabularies are growing by leaps and bounds.  They are bright eyed and healthy and full of energy -- much more energy than we have. The day included tinker toys, books, three mean games of Hi-Ho Cherry-O, books, lunch, books, puzzles, books, naps, quiet time, putting money in the penny bank and saying prayers.  It was a good day.  I need geritol.  And knee replacements.  I am happy to say that the eyes in the back of my head are still in great working order -- guess once a mom always a mom and when you acquire those back head eyes, they are there forever.  Gramps was the reigning champion of building, I was the soother of hurt feelings and tear dryer.  It was a good day as I watched these kids I could see my own at that age -- it was like I could do it all over again from a different perspective.  Being a g-parent is great.  My mom was right -- it is wonderful to be able to play and spoil and love them and then give them back!!As much as I am shocked at reaching a proper grandmotherly age, I love it and really enjoy the time with them.

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, March 24, 2010", "text": "Bean's QuiltWhile Bean is busy growing and practicing gymnastics and practicing her \"Gig Em\" sign, Nona is busy creating a baby quilt.  Mommy and Nona went to the fabric store, The Quilter's Stash, in North Richland Hills a few weeks ago and spent two hours auditioning fabrics for this little quilt.  We came home with twenty two different fabrics and a package of Quilter's Dream batting -- the most wonderful batting on the market, IMHO.Bean's mommy has a wonderful plan for her room, I guess I would call the style \"Americana Cozy\" and that is all I am going to say about it.  She chose a wide variety of fabrics from her inspiration wall decor  and each, in it's own way, evokes memories for me as a lot of it comes from vintage or reproduction lines.  The style of the quilt is very simple -- 4.5 inch squares, randomly set.  The colors are wonderful and have a way of setting off each other.  I arranged them in a truly random way, only making sure that I didn't put two identical squares next to one another.I had been thinking about doing some Welsh quilting on this -- a technique I would like to explore -- but Bean's mommy wants it to be a soft, cuddly quilt and the extensive quilting found on Welsh quilts might make it a bit more stiff so it will be simple quilting.  I am not sure how I am going to quilt it yet  but I think, whatever I do, I will do by hand.  Quilting by hand creates a softer drape and besides, I haven't done anything by hand in a long time and I have been wanting to do something so this project, not being too big, seems the perfect thing.I had thought about finishing the edges with prairie points but, in a way, it seems too stark for a baby quilt so I will probably just choose one of the fabrics and do a simple binding -- maybe with the lovely rose fabric with the meandering flowers.  I want this quilt to be used and soft and washed and dragged around -- a proper working quilt -- not something just folded and put away because Nona made it.I will be backing it with muslin for two reasons.  Muslin comes in very wide widths and I really don't like seams on the back of my quilts.  Plus, muslin washes up very nicely and just gets softer with age and it needles well.  So, that, coupled with my Quilters Dream batting will make a lovely little wrap for Bean!Tomorrow will be the starting point.  I hope to have it basted and in the hoop so I can sit back and be in hand quilting heaven -- the most relaxing hobby I can think of other than napping.  I will post photos of the finished product when it is, in fact, the finished product.Simple Woman's Daybook, March 23, 2010Outside my window I see a cloudy sky with the sun trying to peek through -- it looks like it is going to make it.I am thinking that I really haven't accomplished much today and I am wondering if that really matters.I am thankful for the warmer weather.From the learning rooms I am learning about traditional Welsh quilting.From the kitchen absolutely nothing is going to come today -- it is my kitchen day off -- randomly chosen.I am wearing black slacks and a striped shirt.I am creating a baby quilt for Bean.I am going to have to decide  what my \"quilt as desired\" desire is.I am reading \"Bramwell Valley\" -- silly, silly book.I am hoping to get a better nights sleep tonight.I am hearing Ellen Degeneres in the background.Around the house I am systematically decluttering -- I have been watching \"Hoarders\" -- scary stuff.One of my favorite things is my cat -- so demanding, forces me to think about something other than myself.A few plans for the rest of the week is to finish the baby quilt.Here is a picture thought to share with you:"},

It is supposed to look like this:This one of our pear trees, yesterday, when it was spring.  However, today it is winter again, complete with snow and wind and freezing temperatures which could mean ice and probably the end of the lovely pear blossoms.I haven't heard, officially, but I think this is probably the most peculiar winter in the history of, well, probably the entire planet.  It isn't supposed to be snowing.  We had the a/c on yesterday.  I know this is Texas and the old saying goes \"if you don't like the weather in Texas, just wait a minute and it will change\".  I think every state lays claim to that old saying but here it seems to be especially true, this winter at least. So, I guess I will go curl up with my e-reader and finish the most ridiculous book ever published -- Bramwell Valley. I didn't say it wasn't a GOOD book, it is quite funny, but not my usual fare.  It was, however, free from B&N and, until I have a little more faith and confidence in my Nook, I will continue to download \"free\".  If you want to read something really, really silly, check out Bramwell Valley -- it won't disappoint."},

Secondly, it is sunny and dry (trying not to jinx things here)!  And, I got my hair cut -- a little wonky but cut nonetheless.So, I have energy and I am rip roaring and ready to go to work finishing up some projects.  One I can't show you because it is a gift but just suffice it to say that it will be lovely.The second I can't tell you about either because of the same reason.  However, here are some of the fabrics involved in the creation.The third I can tell you about.  It is a baby quilt for Bean! DD picked out the fabrics -- all colors taken from a set of pictures they are using in the baby room.  She chose 22 fabrics as seen below and, if my math is correct (which is always suspect) it will take 7- 4.5 inch squares of each to make up the top.  It is going to be true patchwork -- just a mishmash of fabrics and wonderfully soft Quilters Dream Batting.  I want it to be cozy and cuddly and just the right size for the baby.The design decision that has me a bit perplexed is the finishing.  I am thinking about prairie points but then, I see a solid binding as well to sort of frame all those prints.  I was going to make the squares smaller but have decided on the 4.5 in. because enough of the print will be visible -- any smaller and I think they would mostly turn into \"solids\" or just \"textures\".  Since there will be no borders or anything I think I am going with either a plain, solid binding or maybe plain, solid prairie points.  I dont know but that decision is a way down the road, I will deal with it then.I am thinking I am going to use my new accuquilt cutter for this.  After all the deliberating over buying the thing, I have yet to remove it from the box.  This might be the perfect time to try it but......on scraps first.  I generally have a huge learning curve on things of this nature.So, that is what is taking up my time right now.  Lots and lots of sewing and planning and cutting and designing and not a lot of confidence even though I have been doing this for almost thirty years! I guess I will always be a novice.  Hmm.."},

However, now it is time to play catch up.I was born on my grandmother's birthday -- February 28.  I guess that was my one distinguishing factor.  My name should have been Rebecca since there was ALWAYS a Rebecca in the family -- my mother broke the chain and named me after a popular tune.  At any rate, I always thought it was special being born on MaMa's birthday.My grandmother Rebecca Madge Foreman was born in San Antonio in 1902.  She led a very unremarkable life being part of a large family with many aunts and uncles and cousins.  She attended Lavaca Street School which I believe is where the current central office of the SAISD now stands as well as Pauline Nelson Elementary School, also SAISD.  She won the Palmer's Handwriting contest for her outstanding penmanship.  She left school at eleven to become employed at a store downtown -- I can't seem to recall the name of the store -- Joy?  A bit later she went to work at the telephone company where she stayed until her marriage in 1918 to James W. Davis who was stationed in San Antonio during basic training in World War 1.  Sometime later that year, after armistice was declared, she joined Jim in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  I am not sure how long she lived in Scranton but the family had moved back to Texas by April of 1921 when my aunt was born.  They remained in Texas the rest of their lives. Rebecca had four children -- Velma, Bette, Jimmy and Linnie and four granddaughters -- Joy Lynn, Diana Jean, Melissa, Penny Gail, and Lori Ann.  She was a good grandmother making clothes, costumes, taking care of us when we were sick, providing stability when things were shaky.  She was always a pillar of strength in my mind.  If there was a problem, MaMa and PaPa could take care of it. Rebecca -- who, to my knowledge, never went by the name Rebecca but rather Madge -- outlived Jim by almost 20 years, passing away in the mid 80's.  To this day I recall hearing the stories about how, when they moved to the \"country\" (which meant old Castle Hills, on Castle Lane) she had a cow that she milked.  She also raised pomeranian  puppies and had chickens.  That was a side of my grandmother I just couldn't get my head around. Well, ok, maybe the puppies.  I remember her having a huge, grey persian cat named Pretty -- it was a sad day when she lost that cat. It was a sad day when we lost my grandmother but I have so many good memories of her -- going shopping and eating at Casa Rio -- EVERY Saturday, tea and toast at her kitchen table almost every day, her house, her Spanish Geranium soap -- yep, that was MaMa. So, Happy Birthday to you MaMa.  You would be 108 years old! Wow, that is a whole lot older than 60 -- you are making me feel good once again!"},

It is my birthday month and, even though this year is a milestone birthday, I was looking forward to it.  Operative word, was.  Now, I am not looking forward to the birthday I am just looking forward to this miserable month being over!When I started school, we were arranged in classes by our birthdays so, my classroom was made up of those whose birthdays fell from January 1 to mid-March.  My best friend, Roger's, birthday was on the 24th, my friend Kathryn's was on the 26th and mine the 28th -- no wonder I can remember that.  February was definitely the month of parties.  Those were the days! Not this year, however.  (Below is a photo of my 6th grade graduation with the majority of the girls in my class -- a couple were missing. )This has been a horrible winter.  We have had snow at least three times.  My grandchildren have contracted some sort of illness that I believe they shared with me. My expectant daughter managed to contract some sort of stomach virus from her husband.  The month is a complete blur.  Complete.So, with that said, I am quite anxious to see February depart and some warm weather takes its place.   I would like to see everybody well and all my projects underway.  I am getting way behind in the project arena.  I want my ears to unstop and my chest to uncongest and I am willing to forego the birthday celebration in order to hasten the healing.On that note, I am going to wish myself a happy birthday, drink copious amounts of water, swallow massive amounts of something to decongest me and take a nap!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, February 24, 2010", "text": "King ArooI don't feel well today and even though I didn't feel like doing much, I didn't feel like being completely unproductive either.  So, I set about cleaning off the desk.  I feel badly about our desk.  We have a perfectly good home office and yet my husband schleps the bills and payments to be made to the dining room table because he can't find the desktop.  It is usually hidden under DAR papers, genealogy papers, old photos to be scanned and junk mail that neither of us looks at but feels that it might be important enough to not throw away.  So, I decided to make the desktop a bit more accessible to him. As I was clearing things out, I found the little yellowed comic strip shown above.  I have been carrying it around with me for some time now because it is important to me.  It is the final newspaper comic strip, \"King Aroo\",  drawn by Jack Kent.  My copy came from the April 17, 1987 issue of Comics Buyer's Guide.Jack Kent was an artist in San Antonio.  He began drawing the \"King Aroo\" comic strip in 1950 and continued for 15 years.  When I was old enough, I never missed a day of reading it.  I remember my father bringing me a copy of a little King Aroo book which I carried around until it finally disintegrated and is no more.Kent went on to write and illustrate children's books.  When my children were small, I joined a book club for them and many of the titles they received were Jack Kent books which we still have in our possession. I believe their favorite was \"Socks for Supper\".  I have since gone on to collect more for my own library of children's books. I believe my personal favorite is \"There's No Such Thing As A Dragon\".As I said earlier, this little comic strip is important to me because it was important to my father.  See, Jack Kent was a good friend of his.  In fact, my father was his best man at his wedding to his wife June.  Jack and June have a son, also named Jack, who I have spoken with via email in the not too distant past.  Jack Jr. is a nice guy which I wouldn't doubt because his folks were nice people.  I wish I hadn't lost his email address.I remember when my dad learned that Kent was ill.  It was a sad day and when he passed away, it was sadder still for my dad who valued the friendship of all those years, it was sad for Kent's fans and for the children who loved his books and the thinly veiled messages therein. So, when I ran across the raggedy, yellowed copy of his last strip, I just had to share it.  I searched \"Jack Kent\" on the internet and found a very recent article written in SA Current.  It is written by a woman whose blog I follow  - http://www.scribblinginsanantonio.com.  The link to the SACurrent article is http://www.sacurrent.com/arts/story.asp?id=70905.  It is a great article and if you are interested in Jack Kent, you will enjoy reading it.In the meantime, I hope you enjoy the final strip of King Aroo.The two photos above were taken at about 7 a.m.Be Gone Winter of 2009-10! Please!I am feeling a very negative post coming on.  I am sick of winter, I am sick of cedar, I am really sick of snow/ice/wintery mix -- in fact, I am just sick, literally.  So, I would love to see a little bit of spring -- please?  However, I did take some photos the other day of the Fort Worth Blizzard of 2010 and thought I would put them up.  They look oddly like the LAST pictures of snow I took because I only seem to stand at the same vantage point -- my garage door or my patio.  But, in any event, for all you folks who wish for snow -- here ya go -- knock yourself out.  I, for one, am ready to see the back end of winter!I know these photos probably don't look like much to my northern friends/family but they were taken early in the day.  The final amount of snow tallied for the day was between 10-14 inches, depending on where you lived. I didn't take any photos of yesterday's snow because it didn't stick and frankly, it looked like feathers and felt like sleet.  It wasn't really nice except that it seemed like you were in a snowglobe as my daughter in law commented.  Today, it is cold but bright sunshine and I have opened all my blinds so I can combat my seasonal affective disorder -- yay, sunshine.Now, if I could just get rid of my cold/cedar fever/rampant allergies -- whatever it is that has ahold of me, I would be a very happy person."},
{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, February 18, 2010", "text": "February 18, 1923On this day in 1923 a second daughter was born to Jim and Madge Davis.  They named her Alma Elizabeth after two of her aunts, Alma Foreman Baker and Elizabeth (Betty) Davies Carroll.  They chose to nickname her Bette, a name she retained until moving to Fort Worth in 1990 when she suddenly became \"Alma\" -- a name I never got used to.Bette was short, blond and a bit on the chunky side.  In this childhood photo she is standing on the left with her older sister, Velma, her cousin Florence who is holding her brother, Jimmy.Bette lived her entire life in San Antonio, Texas where she attended Edison and Jefferson High Schools.  On November 14, 1942 she married her high school sweetheart, Pat Boyett, and began a marriage that would last until her death in 1996. They were a fun-loving couple that lead interesting lives but the greatest thing my mother ever experienced was grandmotherhood --- she adored her grandchildren and, I am certain, would be quite enamored with her great-grandchildren. I am sorry she isn't here to see them -- she would love them -- I like to think she does.I guess the word that would best describe my mother would be that of caretaker.  We were a close-knit family and my mother took care of everybody -- me, Joy, sisters, mothers, and fathers.  I don't think she knew the word \"no\".She was a good mother.  She was always determined that our house would be one that the kids wanted to come to and she opened our door to any friend or cousin that wanted to come over.  Friday was grocery shopping day and she made sure the fridge was stocked with cokes, the pantry with snacks and the record player was in good working order.  She was always there to celebrate my achievements, to sympathize with the broken hearts and to encourage me as I fought my battles.  She sewed dresses and costumes, rolled hair and polished nails.  She raised me with a strong sense of right and wrong.  She instilled in me the love of God and home.  She taught me that no job was too menial to be done correctly and she taught me to care about others and hold family dear. She was a good mother and I still miss her.So, on this day -- her 87th birthday -- I celebrate her, mourn her, remember her and thank her for all she did for me.  I wouldn't be the person I am today if it weren't for her.Happy Birthday, Mamma!"},

Here is how it started --In anticipation of more \"wintery mix\" on Friday, I decided that A and I needed dinner out.  I develop really bad cases of cabin fever very quickly so I do my best to circumvent the issue by running around a lot prior to a \"cabin event\" so that when said even rolls around I am ready to stay home for a day.  Usually my running around in prep involves things like stocking up on groceries (generally milk, coffee and tp), a quick stop at the book store for a stack of new mags to recycle and dinner out.  Well, since Friday might turn into a \"cabin event\", I opted for dinner out last night.We went to this place --This place had been there for a while before we tried it -- our favorites being Rocco's take out or Red Brick Pizza.  One evening we tried it and discovered it to be pretty decent pizza so we have gone there several times now and it's quiet, Tuscan ambiance is very nice -- we choose to sit in the corner by the fireplace.  I didn't realize that Palio's was a chain until I started looking for it's logo -- pretty good for a chain.After dinner I made a quick run to --                                     atThe mall was very quiet, being Tuesday and all, but it was enough to last me through the \"winter event\" -- I am not a mall person.  I was between 11 and say 30 but since then, yeah, not so much.After that, we came home, made a cuppa and sat down to watch the DVR'r segment of my favorite showI don't know why this is my favorite show -- I dated a Mormon boy once who was a believer in polygamy and I knew at the ripe old age of 14 that concept wasn't in my life plan but still, it is a good show.However, while I was watching said favorite show I ingested a number of theseI haven't been enjoying chocolate lately so this wasn't a good choice.  I went to sleep and about 11:30 I woke up needing theseI tried to ignore it but by 2 a.m. I was wide awake, in my chair, drinking yet more tea and reading \"Hide in Plain Sight\" -- my new book on my Nook.  Nook's, by the way, are unbelievably easy to read -- I thought it would be like reading a glary computer screen but it isn't, it is like reading a book -- so nice.Anyway, back to sleep about 3 a.m. -- up at 6 with a whole day ahead and  behind about three days worth of energy.  Sigh.Ok, this is the most ridiculous post I have ever written.  It reminds me of one of those story books when I was a child that had pics in the middle of the text to help new readers.  Yeah, well, I feel pretty childish right now to tell you the truth.  Plus, this post is all about my weakness, indulgence and lack of control so I am not going to post on FB that I am \"blogging\" - instead this is just for me to look at when I feel the need to over-indulge -- a record of just what can happen when there are too many olives, too many cookies and too little control.What will I get accomplished today on too little sleep and still sporting a squeamish tummy?  Probably not a whole lot -- I don't get a whole lot done on a good day -- but I will probably find time to reactivate my Weight Watchers account which I foolishly deleted about three weeks ago because I wasn't participating.  Bad choice -- both lack of participation and cancellation -- so, today I will probably be back tracking and starting over.  I wish I could, for once, just achieve and not constantly be starting over but that seems to be Melissa's way -- blah.Ok, this is the end of the this post -- peppermint tea and a new beginning -- after a nap.

So, there were only three children there -- the birthday boy, his sister and his buddy. But, the three of them were lively enough.The theme of the party was \"firetruck\" -- one of N's favorite things right now.  So, Mom fashioned a firetruck cake from pound cake, oreo cookies, gumdrops and rolled fondant icing.  Since  she didn't want the kids to partake of too much red food coloring, she made this a Fort Worth firetruck which are blue and white.  She also had \"dalmation\" cupcakes which were cupcakes with white frosting with  crumbled chocolate cookies mixed in to make them look spotted and they were topped with icing fire hydrants made by birthday boy's dad.  I didn't get a photo of those, however, but trust me, they were cute.There were gifts galoreBalloons to be popped, friends and auntsGramps and Granny BAnd a good time was had by all!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, January 19, 2010", "text": "I Am Impulsive and WeakEver heard that expression \"the mind is willing but the flesh is weak\"?  I have heard that used in many contexts but never with quilting -- until now.I love to quilt -- if I am in the mood and things don't get all glitchy.  I also have a very, very short attention span.  Right now I have a quilt on the machine, two on the cutting table and one in my  head and guess who isn't in the mood to quilt? Yep.   I think I do ok with the cutting (to a point) and the piecing but when it comes to spreading the whole mess out on a large, flat surface (the floor comes to mind) I just go all ughy.  In the first place, if I put it on the floor there is a huge chance there will be a cat in the middle of it in a nanosecond. Again, if I put it on the floor I risk never being able to get up from pinning it assuming I can get down there to begin with.  So, I asked for a lovely cutting table for Christmas a couple of years ago to help with the process which does help, provided I don't want to create a quilt for my king-sized bed.  I may be employing Georgia Bonesteel's techniques for quilting as I go if I tackle that project again.However, with all these drawbacks in my physical ability and my mental prowess, I still love to quilt.  There is something about creating a blanket that just sends lovey feelings all over me, probably because it reminds me of my great-grandma who essentially got me to thinking about it oh, long around 1954-55.  I mean, come on, the great-great granddaughter of pioneer quilters just can't drop the ball, right?  So, on I go.I have learned a few things along the way though.  I have learned that with all our new fangled gadgets for making like easier, I still liked the evenings at g-grandma's watching her piece quilt blocks with nothing but a needle and a thread and a pair of scissors.  In dull light, I might add.  I have never attempted hand piecing although I would love to but figure the short attention span might not be a good match for it -- I am, after all, a woman of this instant gratification generation.  Still, I am a purist and think the hand piecers/quilters still have it right. However, after cutting out a quilt with scissors one Christmas and finding that all my strips were off between 1/8 and 1/4 of an inch, I gave up on the scissors and went back to the rotary cutter. That was better.  However, the rotary cutter and ruler aren't my best friends -- I seem to be a bit ruler dysfunctional but it is still better than scissors -- I have just learned to jiggle things a bit to make them fit.  Of course, I do lots of strip piecing and stuff like that, I don't really cut out quilt squares and piece things together -- I take the easy way out.In any event, I caved in and bought one of these today.It is called Accuquilt Go and is a die cutter for fabric.  I have seen one used and I have watched the video.  It all looks very promising and not nearly so messy as my rotary cutting.  I have read many reviews and the only negative one I found was today, AFTER the purchase.  I haven't tried it out yet -- I refuse to unpack it until I am further along with the ones I have already started -- otherwise I will just get even more distracted and have three more projects in various stages of completion.I will report back in when I have had some experience with the thing but I will say that sassy pic of the lady holding it with one hand -- yeah, I had to have somebody carry the box to the car for me -- it only weighs 15 pounds but -- well, I'm just sayin'."},

I have a running wish list of books, quilting/needlecraft supplies, DVD's and CD'S for them to choose from as well as one of my favorite things -- gift cards.This year I made hubby a Christmas list of reasonable items.  Ok, the Nook wasn't reasonable and probably not even logical (except in My mind) but the rest of the list was quite manageable in all senses of the word.One of the things on my list was this book.It is the cutest book of non-traditional baby quilts.  It shows examples of quilts using free forms, non-traditional piecing, embroidery, gorgeous fabrics and many examples of \"why didn't I think of that\".  It supplies patterns and templates and tutorials by the quiltmakers themselves.The neatest thing it contains is websites, blogsites and etsy sites for all the contributors.  I spent last evening visiting each of the websites, completely enjoying myself and have every intention of adding them to my blogroll.  Such talent is a joy to look at. Linda Kopp did an outstanding job with this book -- it is full of information of all sorts and is a delight to read.  For me, it makes me want to be brave and just cut into that piece of fabric and do something daring!Then, right after Christmas we ventured from our familiar area and took a long ride to Frisco to visit Stonebriar Center.Stonebriar Center is a very large mall with every store imaginable.  There is a movie theater, a Cheesecake Factory, Restoration Hardware, Nordstroms, a Lego store -- you name it, it is there.  So, where was the first place hubby and I went?  Yep, you guessed it -- Barnes and Noble.  This particular B&N wasn't any larger than the two I frequent in our area of town but it had a number of different things.  It had Nook accessories.  Of course, they didn't have any left since it was right after Christmas but they DID have them, unlike our B&N which barely has a display of the pamphlets for product itself.  They also had a huge selection of craft books from woodworking to quilting and everything in between.  Of course, I needed a sourvenir of my visit to this monumental mall so I chose this--This is a lovely little book by Susan Briscoe showing examples of blocks done in the Asian inspiration.  They look so complicated but when they are broken down, they are so basic! The fabrics are gorgeous, the instructions easy to follow and the end results for the quilts are just outstanding.  I am thinking of making one for myself even though I had sworn off large quilts -- I might have to rescind that notion.It was a fun day in Frisco.  Now, my next trip is to North Richland Hills to one of my favorite quilt stores -- The Quilter's Stash.I love this quilt store for lots of reasons.  In the first place, it is bright! I have a couple of other favorites but they are so dark inside you want to take the fabric outside to see the colors well.  Not at Quilters Stash, however.  Another reason I love this store is that the people who work there are knowledgable and are more than willing to help you.  I have learned a lot from them just talking to them while they cut my fabric.  Also, it is a very well stocked store -- they have everything you need and they are the only store that I know of in the area that carries Quilter's Dream batting which is the very best batting in the entire world.  I feel a visit coming on soon -- like maybe tomorrow!So, all this talking about quilting has me inspired.  I am off to work on my three projects and, hopefully, I will have something to show you before too long."},

Told you it would be a quick read.Some Things Never ChangeIt is true, some things never change -- I guess the way we do things is just imbedded in our DNA -- or something.  At any rate, I have always been an impulsive, or maybe compulsive, reader.  Reading has always been a fascination for me ever since I sat next to my mother while she read the newspaper and I would ask her what it felt like to be able to read.  When I went to school I was a quick learner and I was probably the only child in my class that looked forward to the required reading list passed out at the beginning of the term.  I found our public library to be a completely magical place and loved to spend time there.  I had my favorite authors, even at age 8, and would strive to read all their titles.However, I have never been able to just sit down and read every day.  I would either sit and read for entire days or let many days pass between books.  It would go in phases and it still does.  Right now I am in my \"read everything I can as fast as I can\" stage.  I don't know if it has to do with the fact that I have so many \"to be read\" books filling my two book cases and my window seat that I had to go out and buy three more bookcases or if I am anticipating my Nook being delivered tomorrow and don't want to forget about my hard copies.  It could have to do with the fact that it is my least messy pasttime as well.  I don't take that lightly.At any rate, I am starting a new book today -- \"Summer Crossing\" by Truman Capote. It is set in post World War II New York and it follows a young socialite named Grady McNeil who has been left alone in her parents penthouse for the summer.  It is a light romance which turns serious and, apparently, the young woman must make serious decisions that will affect her life as well as the lives of everyone else. Sounds like serious business to me.I tend to read the reviews on the backs of the books and here are a few from this one:\"The writing is nervously alive with the excitement of Capote enjoying his own strengthening powers.\"  -- Entertainment Weekly\"An outstanding piece of literature...a page-turning story.\" -- The Sunday Oklahoman\"Witness the coming together of Truman Capote's voice, the electric-into-neon blaze that is surely one of the premier styles of postwar American literature.: -- The Washington Post Book World\"Summer Crossing\" was Capote's first book, apparently written while Capote was working for \"The New Yorker\".  It was lost, or thought to be destroyed, but was, in fact, rescued from the rubbish by a house-sitter occupying an apartment that Capote had once resided in.  The work was put up for auction at Sotheby's in 2004 and when to the publisher in 2005.It is a short work and I am sure it will be a quick read.  I have a feeling this is going to be one of my \"all day reading\" days."},

I find that I only explain the plots and never get into character analysis, setting, subplots or any of that so I will make this brief.I just finished \"An Amish Gathering -- Life in Lancaster County\" by Beth Wiseman, Kathleen Fuller and Barbara Cameron.  It is actually a compilation of three novellas depicting the life of different families in the same area.  Each story contains elements of loss, love, redemption and, ultimately, a happy ending.I really enjoy reading the Amish novels and I am not sure why.  I think I like them because so many of them take place in Pennsylvania and I identify with PA because of my family who were decidedly NOT Amish.  In any event, these novellas seem to be a bit edgier than most of the others I have read.  One deals with anger and abuse, one deals with friendships outside the community and the desire to have a career other than the traditional Amish wife and one deals with mental health issues with a bit of pride and jealousy thrown it.  These novellas actually seems more real than what I have read in these types of books before -- there is a real human element in them.I enjoyed this collection and read it very quickly, for me.  I will probably seek out more works of the authors."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, January 11, 2010", "text": "Happy Birthday, PaPaYesterday was my grandfather's birthday. He was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania on January 10, 1896.  Even when I was a child that seemed like a very long time ago.  He was born to James and Dinah Davies who had immigrated to Pennsylvania from Blaina, Wales in 1890.  Half of his siblings were born in Wales and half were born in the United States and two of his siblings died as babies are are buried somewhere in Wales.My grandfather's surname was really Davies but a clerical error in the local Catholic school resulted in the \"e\" being dropped from his name -- not, however from his brother's name -- the brother who stood in line right before him!  But, because of that error, Jim was forever more a Davis.When he was born they had gaslights in their house, outdoor plumbing and he rode a horse to the nearby school they called \"the sister school\".  His feet were so small that he wore the same oxfords the nuns did.  When he was eleven he left the sister school and went to work in the coal mines with his father and his brothers, bringing their pay home to Mam.  Sounds like a scene out of \"How Green Was My Valley\" doesn't it.  I am sure it was similar.I think my grandfather was a little scrapper -- he was always in trouble -- so much that his older brother, Louis,  had to pick him up from school to keep him in line.  I think Louis kept all the kids in line because he carried a whip with him and, from all accounts, he knew how to use it.In 1914, James Davies passed away leaving Dinah with still young children.  In 1918, Jim and brother Dan joined the army and Jim was sent to San Antonio, Texas for basic training.  That is where he met my grandmother, Madge Foreman.In 1918 they married, lived in Scranton for a while and eventually ended up in San Antonio where they raised four children and lived out their lives rather uneventfully.  Jim passed away in 1969 with Madge following in 1987.I remember my grandfather well -- he was short, about 5'4\", and small.  He was gruff and no nonsense but I think he really liked his five granddaughters.  He didn't fuss over us but he took care of us when we needed him to.  I remember spending a Saturday in the backyard with him as he picked up pecans that had fallen and as he picked them up I did the same -- the only thing different was he put his in a bucket and I replanted mine in the flower beds.  He grumped about those trees coming up in the flower beds for years after.  He didn't really get angry though.  I used to love sitting at the kitchen table having \"tea and toast\" or \"cheese toast\", which was really Welsh Rarebit, with him.  I still have the table.  He used to take me into the garage and show me where he had the stash of \"emergency\" money, divided up by denomination in baby food jars --jars of dimes, quarters, nickles and silver dollars.  I still have some of the dimes.  He was a very precise little man.I remember many things about my grandfather and I wish I had had the foresight to ask him about his youth, his life in Scranton, his mother and father but I didn't -- I was only 19 when he died and was much more interested in my boyfriend and going to college.  I have had to find out all those things on my own with the help of Joy.  So, I actually know more about him now than I did then, I just wish I had learned it from him.Papa would be 114 years old which sounds very old to me.  However, when you think about it, in his life span, they went from gaslights to electric lights, from the horse to cars and he was fortunate enough to live to see the first man on the moon.  He lived during an incredible time of growth and development and advancement -- more so than any of the rest of us.So, happy birthday, PaPa -- I wish you were here to see me write this on a computer, put up a photo that was sent to me electronically by Joanie and put it out for all to read.  I wonder what you would think about it -- about us -- about our world today.  It is something to think about."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, January 04, 2010", "text": "Off to a Running StartAs I promised myself, I started on my new cross stitch project -- \"Fuji\" by Terrance Nolan.  I began this on 16 count evenweave but after a few stitches realized that my eyes would be better suited to 14 ct. aida.  So, I started again.  Now, I am not good at figuring out how to convert sizes so I figured I would just use a really big piece of fabric.  I bought the biggest packaged piece I could find which is 30\" X 36\".  Needless to say, when you begin in the center, this is more than a little unwieldy.  At any rate, I should have plenty of fabric.I am going about this project a bit different than I usually do.  While I am starting in the center I am completing one grid square at a time.  The pattern is divided up into five parts, each part being on a different page so I started with the top, left hand side of the pattern but began at the bottom, right hand side which is the corner in the middle.  Confusing, I know.  At any rate, the first grid square is about 36 squares and that is what I have completed.  That 36 squares was made up of four different colored threads -- I can tell this is going to take a long, long time.  That is ok, though, because this is the first project I have done that I haven't been under some sort of deadline to finish.  That is sort of throwing me off a bit but I hope to be able to enjoy making the picture rather than just trying to get it done.I haven't taken a photo yet because there really isn't much to take a photo of -- 36 squares of varying shades of beige/brown with a little grey/blue in it.  I will take a photo tomorrow when I get a bit further.I also started reading \"An Amish Gathering -- Life in Lancaster County\".  It is a work of three Amish novellas written by Beth Wiseman, Kathleen Fuller and Barbara Cameron.  I was in B&N the other day, looking for Nook accessories, and it caught my eye -- again, a catchy cover.  I am really glad the Nook shows the cover of the books otherwise I would never know how to choose one!At any rate, I am a few pages into the first story.  It is about a young Amish woman who dreams of being a writer and writing about the English who seem, in her eyes, to have problems with religion.  Of course, while the young woman is busy trying to be a writer her sister and her mother are busy trying to get her married so her rebellious streak is rearing its ugly head.  As I said, only a few pages in so I am not sure if I am going to enjoy it or not.I also started trying to keep a journal. Ha! Not doing any better job now than the million other times I have tried but I will keep after it and hopefully not give up after the first three days.After thinking about my time management \"issues\" I decided to try to budget my time to do more of what I want to do.  I think I have done pretty well for the last couple of days.  I feel better about doing what I have to do when I make time to do what I want to do."},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, January 02, 2010", "text": "Off to a Good StartAs I said in a previous post -- I don't believe in resolutions for the New Year.  I did do some soul searching, however, and realized that I don't use my time well.  There are things I love to do but I procrastinate terribly -- that translates into watches too much television.  So, I decided to make a concerted effort -- within my perameter of living one day at a time -- to do more of the things I love to do and quit worrying about the things I don't -- that translates into worry about housework.One of the things I love is quilting.  I have two projects going but can't show you here because they are a secret! I will show you photos eventually, just not now.Another thing I love is cross stitch.  Four or five years ago I bought some patterns by Terrance Nolan.  The names of the patterns are \"Fuji\" and \"Haiku\" and they are the most beautiful birds I have ever seen -- they work up very nicely as I saw the models.  I did start these once but was using 16 ct. even weave and, after about 20 stitches, I realized that is just too small for these eyes so I bought 14 ct. aida and intend to start over.  Since I hadn't gotten very far I don't feel bad about it.  I will be doing the work without a hoop as I am finding that my fingers don't do well while clutching things for long periods of time -- like the remote control or the Wii controller.I will begin with \"Fuji\" as seen below.  He is really a gorgeous little guy and I will post photos as I progress.  I don't think this will be a quick finish.When I get done with \"Fuji\" I will start on \"Haiku\". I am sorry the photo is so small but it is just as lovely.  Actually, the patterns don't look too difficult, lots of colors, and some specialty threads -- I am looking forward to it.Another thing I am trying to do more of is read.  I was always an avid reader and have somehow let the pasttime slide.  However, mid-month I am getting my Christmas present -- a Nook, the e-reader introduced by Barnes and Noble.  I can hardly wait and have already purchased a cover for it that looks like this--Another thing I am going to try to do more of is cook.  It is difficult with an overweight me and a diabetic husband who doesn't like leftovers but I am trying.  So, with that said, I am off to bake a cake for lunch tomorrow.  I hope it freezes well since neither one of us are supposed to be eating it!!  Maybe I will post a pic of it --"},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, January 01, 2010", "text": "January 1, 2010Today is the first day of, not only a new year, but a new decade as well.  I have never been one to think much about the changing of the year except to wonder how many checks I will mess up writing the wrong date.However, it was brought to my attention that this year is not only the beginning of a new decade but it is the end of one, as well.  This is the end of my 50's.  I will have completed six decades.Wow, I don't know what to do with that.I don't even remember my 50's.  Let's see, I was busy with the last stages of child rearing --  college, broken legs, broken hearts, new loves, weddings, babies, new houses for all, new cars, smashed cars, surgery, fear, prayer, tears, laughter and most of all, love.But, I don't remember my age -- or what I wore.Clothes have always been an necessary evil.  I was never at the \"right age\" for the clothing I was interested in.  The last time I remember being what I thought was correct was probably junior high school -- Bobbie Brooks and soft socks -- not difficult to achieve.  I remember trying to figure out what to wear to work --  it shouldn't have been that hard but it was at a time when slacks were just becoming acceptable so that just sort of threw a monkey wrench into the whole thing.  Then, I remember my mother telling me that 27 was the best age -- the clothes were great, you were adult and could dress up but still be young.Hm...27, I was wearing rice cereal and formula most of the time.  Don't get me wrong, I loved every minute of it but still, not exactly the picture that my mother painted. So it went for the next few years, I was a stay at home mom, IT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER!So, here I am.  Almost -- well, almost not 59 anymore and the question still comes up, what am I supposed to be at this age.  I realize that question emcompasses more than just attire.  It also relates to attitudes, concerns, acceptable appearance, societal expectations -- wow, who knew that a birthday meant more than a cake and some gifts.I don't feel my age -- well, my right knee does.  I am shocked everytime I look in the mirror and see silvery hair -- THIN, silvery hair rather than the thick, dark auburn mane I used to possess.  If I don't use the 10X mirror I don't see the little wrinkles but if I don't use the 10X mirror I can't see to put on my makeup.  I realize I am wearing cardigan sweaters more and more -- that is definitely an \"old\" lady thing.  It is like the upcoming decade is sucking me up into the mist of old age!  I must fight this and fight it now!So, I have been doing a lot of thinking today -- what does this age mean? I think it means what you want it to mean.  I guess for some it will be Vicki Lawrence's character \"Mama\".  For others it will be Meryl Streep or Paula Deen.  I think that in this day and age the concept of age is going the way of newspapers and books and pay phones and corner mailboxes.  Age, or aging, just doesn't exist -- after all, isn't 40 the new 30? Hmm. then I guess 60 is the new 50 --- damn, that still sounds old.  But, I think my mom was right -- age is a matter of the mind and with all the technology and \"stuff\" we have out there today, age isn't really as much of an issue these days.So, I think I am going to approach this decade the same as I have the past ones.  I am going to ignore it.  And just think, with debit cards, I don't even have to worry about messing up the date on the check.  Ain't technology grand!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, December 31, 2009", "text": "My apologies --In re-reading my post of earlier, there is a typo that I can't seem to correct because google won't let me! Trust me that I do know the difference between there and their and they're -- I just don't type so well anymore.  So, lest I offend anyone (dear daughter comes to mind) I will rectify the error as soon as Google lets me.  I hope I don't have to go back to Wordpress.Ushering out the Old and Ringing in the New!I have read on several blogs, FB comments and heard in queues that people are glad to see 2009 go -- don't let the door hit you in the rear as you exit!  I don't feel that way about 2009.  Of course, it could be that I didn't have a bad year.  I didn't have a monumental year, either.  I just had a year.  It was quiet -- thank God -- and uneventful -- again, thank God.  As I age I recognize the value and blessing of \"uneventful\" or \"boring\".  There is nothing quite as comforting as \"boring\".Of course, there are things I wish I had accomplished like losing weight, exercising more, reading more books, being a nicer person but there are no huge regrets.  I was blessed by becoming  better acquainted with my DOK sisters and actually seeing the power of prayer through the diligence and faith of these women.  I was blessed by my increased involvement in DAR which has strengthened by belief that we do, in fact, live in the greatest country in the world and that we should not take it for granted but be staunch in our values and standards for which our flag flies and our troops defend.It goes without saying that watching the g-kiddos grow is a blessing and a privilege for which there are no words.  Learning, during the latter part of the year, that there is to be a new addition to the family in 2010 has brought joy, excitement and blessing to this family and we can hardly wait to see Bean Wilcox in the summer.  What greater purpose can their be for the new year than to gather around these children and watch them grow and flourish.As New Year's Eve approaches AW and I are settling in for a home cooked meal as the rain falls.  There are no parties or get-togethers planned -- we abandoned all that years ago.  It is a joy for us to kick off the shoes and watch a movie or listen to music.I am sure by midnight we will be past the point of no return.I am sure that Rollie, being the teenage cat that he is, has other plans, however.I sincerely hope, however, that he lays off trying to eat ribbon.  It doesn't work well for him and isn't a pretty sight.So, as the end of 2009 approaches I just want to say to everyonewhatever that means to you.  As for me, I am hoping for another \"boring\" year"},

I loved this movie the first time I saw it and the second was no different and each time I was inspired. I can't cook. I don't like to go to the grocery store. Visiting Williams-Sonoma is an entirely different matter, however. I can't imagine what it would be like to shop in a French kitchen shop with one of those old, fold-up baskets like we used to use at the five and dime and just casually throw in whisks, copper pots, and big, beautiful rolling pins. I should cook, shouldn't I, especially since I have a weakness for all things kitchen.The first time I saw the movie, I looked at the cookbook at Borders. I discovered then that I would never be a Julia Child or even a Julie Powell, even though she can cook and write, both goals and desires of mine.  There is no way that I will ever \"save\" chicken livers -- in fact, I don't even buy chickens WITH livers -- and I am sure than in the remainder of my life, I will never, ever bone a duck.  But still, the draw to such gorgeous cuisine is almost irrestible.I do cook a bit, however, but I need a cookbook -- no natural talent here -- and I am very messy but still, I do have my moments.  For instance, I do make fruitcakes almost every Christmas and this year I did make Cousin Jean's Welsh Cakes which were very good.  I have no photos of those but I do have some photos of a meal I made back in the summer -- flatbread with Asparagus Milanese.  So, welcome to my messy kitchen and my lovely dinner."},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, December 26, 2009", "text": "Project completedA while back my daughter in law asked for some old fashioned embroideried cup towels.  Since I like to do that sort of thing, I began making a set for her.  I didn't want to post photos here since they were for a gift but, since the gift has been given I am now posting  photos of the finished project.  I enjoyed doing them and am thinking of doing some for myself.Christmas Eve 2009I guess all of us have some idea of what the perfect holiday is.  It is probably made up of memories from childhood, not always accurate, probably department store fantasy, probably some preconceived notion of what it is SUPPOSED to be.  At any rate, for many of us, the perfect holiday is probably not achievable -- too much perfection involved.This Christmas was no different for me.  I harken back to the Christmas's of my childhood -- great recollections of  going to relatives houses, egg nog and black olives (thanks for the memory, Penny), lots of gifts, real trees, big, colorful lights and food.  Teenage years brought Christmas parties at home with all the neighborhood kids -- dancing school Christmas parties, new Bobbie Brooks skirts and sweaters, the boyfriend coming home from A&M for the holidays -- blue northers blowing through south Texas that would chill you to the bone only to be gone the next day! Of course, my memory likes to obliterate the thoughts of cedar allergies (yes, even back then), calendar towels, relatives arguing and messing up the whole thing for others.  But, hey, it is my perfect vision -- I have the right to obliterate those things.Then I think back to my children's Christmas's. We were always at the grandparents houses, lots of toys and food and happiness all around.  Of course, my selective memory is leaving out the little boy so desperately allergic to the winter that he was sick every year with horrible earaches but he wouldn't give up and give in -- had to go on.  I am also choosing to forget how sick the little girl got sitting on bales of hay while portraying a lovely little lamb in the church Christmas pagent.  I still have the cotton ball covered hat. No, my dream holiday doesn't include sick children.I sort of thought I was going to have the perfect holiday this year.  We were going to go to daughter's house on Christmas Eve and, in anticipation of the \"wintery weather\" we were planning on spending the night -- a first for us.  I was looking very forward to this since Christmas Eve is, in my \"perfect holiday\", the epitome of Christmas.  Well.....this happened.The wind was blowing like a hurricane and the event was aptly dubbed \"a BLIZZARD\".  It must have been because we had snow drifts in the yard.And ice in the birdbath.In the spirit of the sick little boy of the years past, we wouldn't let this get us down.  We were determined to get to daughters house for an evening of holiday food, movies and perfection so we forged ahead.  Heading down the highway to pick up Grandmother we saw an accident.  Not a tragic accident but more an inconvenient accident for those involved. At  Grandmother's house it was harrowing to see the elderly bundling up against the bitter cold wind trying to maneuver walkers through slush, blowing snow and patches of thin ice. However, with Grandmother bundled into the back seat and gifts and food safely ensconsed in the trunk off we go -- retracing our travel, back on the highway, there is another accident.  No driver in sight, one car sideways in the road -- no damage -- not sure what happened but everybody was slamming on brakes, sliding dangerously close to one another.  That is when I got THE LOOK from the hubby.  You know, the one that lets you know that this just isn't going to happen.  Well, it didn't -- circling around, back on the highway for the third time back to Grandmother's we went to drop her off at her apartment and venture home.  The streets were freezing much quicker than we anticipated and visibility was scary to say the least.  Obviously my dream holiday vision was evaporating fast.  I was angry and disappointed not to mention just a little more than frightened at the prospect of winding up in a 20+ car pile up less than a mile from my house.The Perfect Christmas Eve was not to happen this year so I threw myself a huge pity party instead and spent the evening doing laundry which my husband was very thankful for - so glad I could oblige him.However, Christmas Day dawned bright and sunny and even though the streets were bad and we didn't venture out to church, the afternoon turned out to be very enjoyable.  The daughter and hubby came over and spent the afternoon, we had a little food and exchanged some gifts and had a good time -- well as good as I could under the influence of Benadryl and feeling like a wrung out dishrag -- oh, yes, I forgot to mention that the cedar fever is hanging on way, way too long now.And, we did have a lot of fun with the family cat.  Our Rollie had found his gifts a few days before and we had to hide them from him.  When I finally remembered where I had put them, I wrapped them up for him and let him go to town unwrapping his loot! He really likes to get \"into\" the spirit of things!And, mission accomplished! Of course, he only went after the catnip laced items and left the jingley balls in the bag.  He is such a catnip snob!The evening was spent at our son's house with him, our daughter in law and grandchildren.  Grandmother got her day out, we didn't do any slipping and sliding and a good time was had by all.  I would post photos if I had taken any but the Benadryl has robbed me of my mind and I forgot to take the camera out of my purse! Oh well, maybe next year.  However, one tradition refused to be daunted -- the little-boy-turned-grown-man (the sick little guy from Christmas's past) was sick again this Christmas Eve.  One look at the red nose and droopy eyes and it was 1980 again and I realized that it wasn't Christmas Eve that wasn't perfect but rather my vision of the event that was flawed.  So, in adjusting my vision I know that all that was important was our safety, our health, being here and being together and that desiring such perfection was, in reality, selfishness.  So, I am going into the new year with a new vision -- and that is no preconceived notion at all -- just enjoying what comes, accepting glitches in the system and being happy for the good things we have.And so, to everyone reading this -- Happy Boxing Day! That might be my next Perfect Holiday."},

I am not sure I like it yet so it may change -- who knows.  Guess you will just have to come back and check it out.I am doing a lot of different things this year -- changing things around to spice up the season.  I love tradition but this year, due to severe lack of energy, cedar fever and a good helping of Bah-humbugginess -- I decided to refrain from putting up my Christmas village.  Well, all those reasons plus we need to figure out how to build some risers for it to make all the cords easier to conceal.  Anyway, here is a photo from years past.I added something new this year in the form of what is probably the cheesiest thing ever -- EVER.  I bought THIS--I really rather like him and, for some reason, he reminds me of my Aunt Velma who loved things of this sort.  I even went to the website --- which is very clever, I might add -- and I registered him and named him.  His name is Tuppy.I can't forget about Tinklepaw.  I haven't talked much about Tinklepaw or put up many of his photos even though he has quite a few -- he has traveled with us and enjoyed past holidays.  So, I decided I would put up a photo now and here he is -- Jingle Bell Tinklepaw!And last but not least, we bought a new tree.  Usually our little tree goes in the middle of the village but this year, without the village, we opted for a taller tree.  It is tall but very slender so I didn't have to rearrange the house to put it up.  And, conveniently, it fits right next to a plug.  You will notice that I have a little helper in this photo.  Well, ok, little isn't an operative word here and, actually, neither is helper but nonetheless, here is Rollie taking in the tree trimming festivities. Even though he is the incredible hulk of tabby cats, I think he is a very handsome guy, don't you?So, that is where I am in the Christmas process.  I have watched several Christmas movies -- \"Going My Way\", \"Elf\", \"Remember the Night\" and \"New in Town\" which isn't really a Christmas movie, I don't suppose, but there is lots of snow so it works for me!"},

I have been doing a little quilting, a little genealogy, a little embroidery but it has been so little that a blog it doesn't make.  However, I have been doing a little reading as well and now I can comment on my two latest finishes.The first would be \"Confessions of a Counterfeit Farm Girl\".  This was the most hysterical book I have read in a while --- the real life account of Susan Mc Corkindale's journey from big city life complete with high power magazine job to a farm that she, her husband and two children are tending for a relative.  It is funny, frustrating, enlightening and let's you know just how fortunate you are to be a block or two away from a Starbucks.  It is light reading, goes quickly and is good for more than a chuckle or two.The second book I read recently was Glenn Beck's \"Common Sense\".  I would recommend this book for any American regardless of political party preference, religious preference or race.  It is food for thought -- pick one up, read it and pass it on to a friend."},

It is the story -- or stories -- of Marina Buriakov.  The primary story is of her life in Leningrad during World War II where she worked as a tour guide at the Hermitage Museum.  It portrays her life as the German's approach signals the beginning of the war and all that transpires thereafter.  The subplot involves Marina as a grandmother attending her granddaughters wedding.  Marina has alzheimers that is waging another sort of war in her life.  Both stories are depicted in great, painful detail.  The book is well written but, as I said, painful.  You ache for the youth who is doing her best to survive in impossible times.  You weep for the elderly lady who, after going through all she went through before, has to keep fighting.  It is almost a relief when the book ends.  It isn't a long book and it is a fairly easy read given that it goes back and forth between the past and present with each chapter.  It is a sad book.  I would recommend it because it is well written but be forewarned that it produced much emotion."},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, September 08, 2009", "text": "Mona Lisa SmileAfter I went to the grocery store, did a couple of loads of laundry, did a load of dishes and dusted the house I decided to reward myself by watching a movie.  I had already missed the President's message to students because I was running errands so I thought I would sit down and just enjoy something.I chose to watch a movie that my daughter had loaned me -- one of her favorites -- probably because one of her goals is to teach college.  So, I began \"Mona Lisa Smile\" with Julia Roberts.  I remember wanting to see this when it came out but somehow missed it -- probably because it was something that AW wouldn't particularly enjoy although I don't know why.  At any rate, it is the story of Kathryn Watson, an art history professor who, in 1954,  relocates to Wellesley from California and finds her progressive self smack in the middle of mid-century tradition and mores.  Her students challenge her from the beginning, shake her resolve and, by the end of the movie love her dearly.  There are a couple of subplots -- Watson's own failed romantic life, and the lives of a couple of her students outside of school.  Maggie Gyllenhall is the loose living girl, sleeping her way through her degree, Julia Stiles is the young woman who longs for Harvard Law School and Kirsten Dunst is the angry  young woman who learns all too early what being a \"good wife\" means.  It all ends well, very predictably, but it was a good movie.  The scenery was gorgeous.I found it to be a somewhat depressing movie, however.  Being a child of the 50's I remember it as a more innocent time.  It was, in my memory, quite idyllic.  I do remember my mother saying that \"in her day\" all women could do, for the most part, was be nurses, teachers, or telephone operators, if they worked at all, each job having it's own \"tag\" so to speak.  The desired position was, above all, housewife.  It sounded different coming from her than it seemed in this movie.  The constraints of the era were boldly displayed in this film and it made me feel sorry for the women who came before me."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, August 31, 2009", "text": "Our Daughter's BirthdayOnce upon a time AW and I had two little babies.  The first was a little boy --- a red haired, blue eyed bundle of energy, affection and temper.  Then, three and three quarters years later we had our second child -- a little girl with big eyes, curly blond hair and precocious nature.  It was every parents dream -- they were gorgeous, intelligent children with creative minds and robust personalities.  I couldn't have been more pleased.When they were small they did pretty well at keeping the Monster Sibling Rivalry at bay.  They had their moments like one Christmas when the Star Wars boxes were larger than the Cricket boxes and the fussing ensued and the tears flowed -- if not kept in check, Christmas can really result in major meltdowns. For the most part, however, he played the big brother role quite well in saving her life and keeping her from getting lost and making sure that she got something new when he went shopping with his grandmother.When they became school aged kids there was more competition -- mostly centered around school.  However, this usually leveled out with both acquiring their share of ribbons and awards. This was the time, however, when the sibling rivalry was the most prevalent.  He was almost a teenager -- she was a little sister -- she was annoying and he had a temper.  There were times with much flailing of arms and legs and shrieks and banishing to separate rooms.  We bought a van with captains seats so they didn't have to sit next to each other.  That was a smart move. Mom's hair was getting much greyer by this point.Fast forward to young adulthood -- a metamorphosis of sorts.  She had evolved from a gangley girl to a lovely young woman, dancing her way through high school, excelling in her studies and becoming a serious thinker.  His temper was waning and he learned patience and independence as only one can by living on his own and learning about life through experience.  They talked.  She ran to him in times of distress.  He included her in some of his activities -- like going to the coffee house on Cooper.  She spent the night in his apartment.  They were becoming friends.  Mom and Dad gave sighs of relief -- their children were becoming friends.Fast forward to yesterday.  My daughter will turn thirty next week -- a big day for her being met with a bit of trepidation -- so, in order to ease the moment for her, her husband, AW and I are hosting a party for her.  Unfortunately, her brother and his family have a scheduling conflict which won't allow them to attend.  This saddened my daughter because, even though they still have their moments of picking at each other, her brother is very important to her.  However, her brother and sister-in-law rose to the occasion and tackled the issue head on -- they threw her a party! It was a lovely party with a gorgeous, dark chocolate cake made by SIL, party hats and a banner made by sister-in-law and nephew -- the artist in residence.  Brother chose a well thought out gift which was a rousing success.  It was a wonderful party and I got the joy of sitting back and watching my adult children be what I always hoped they would be -- close to each other -- doing something for each other and caring about each other.  I guess at the end of the day that is what all parents want above all.  It seems to me that she wasn't the only one to get a gift."},

It is wonderful, I have to admit, but it seems to have resulted in gross neglect of our blogs.  Now, I love reading blogs.  I don't know what is so enticing about them but they are some of my favorite reading around.  However, with the advent of Facebook it seems much more schedule friendly to pop in, say a quick hello or update your status, letting people know you are still alive but there is little in the way of substance, photos or creative writing.   Although I am not a serious blogger, I have let my blog go in deference to FB, as well.  I am, therefore, going to take a step back and examine my priorities and put my blogging/blog reading first.  After all, it just takes a couple of minutes to post your status, right?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, August 24, 2009", "text": "Weekend MoviesAW and I watched two movies over the weekend -- one on tv and one a Netflix offering.  Both movies were very good although very different.  It seems that we managed to reach a happy medium in our cinema viewing this week.The first, from Netflix, was \"Ghost Town\".  A really cute movie with Ricky Gervais is sort of a \"Ghost\" in comedic form.  I love Gervais in \"The Office\" and was thrilled to see him do such a good job in this movie.  It was basically a love story and a ghost story, poignant and funny.  It was entertaining and I recommend.The second movie, \"A Time to Kill\" was older, circa 1992 or so, with Samuel L. Jackson, Matthew McConaghy, Kevin Spacey, Donald Sutherland and Sandra Bullock.  It was centered around a murder case -- Jackson's character murdered two white men for the rape of his daughter--and the subsequent trial and unrest that it evoked in a small southern town.  It was a really good movie with a great cast. I would definitely recommend this one -- let's just say the younger cast is easy on the eyes.I have no clue what is next on my Netflix list but, after several weeks of movies that I wasn't thrilled with, I was glad that \"Ghost Town\" turned out to be so good!"},

Now, I know I sound like an eccentric old bird, but I have always liked subtle, offbeat additions to my environment.  So, when we put in the flower bed in the back, I immediately started thinking about what kind of \"yard art\" I could fill it with.   Well, AW isn't a huge fan of \"yard art\" and he looks at my gnome with much disdain so I decided I better keep it to a minimum.  After much internet searching, I discovered a site called Enchanted Gardens (www.miniature-gardens.com).  They have a lovely assortment of miniature garden doors, buildings, windows, etc.  I chose, after much deliberating with AW, the Pixie door.  It came yesterday and I am very pleased with it.  It is darker than the photo shows which is ok because it blends in very well and isn't so \"in your face\".  I am sure any self-respecting fairy would prefer to be tasteful.  Now, I am sure I will never create an entire miniature village, although the idea is definitely enticing, but I might have to add a wee creature to the area -- if one doesn't come on it's own! Heh, heh --- my English/Welsh/Irish roots are showing.Anyway, here are the photos! I have to say though that while I was out looking for meteors last night I didn't see any evidence of any fairies moving into my tree.  Oh well, maybe the word isn't out yet that I have the coolest door!"},

It was really good -- not a chick flicky as I thought it would be.  The scenery was gorgeous.  Just see it -- I think even husbands would like it.  Really.Netflix movie -- \"Mongols\"Ok, I don't know what comes over me when I add movies to my Netflix queue.  I am always trying to find something that AW will like, mixed in with all the chick flicks and historical fiction that I like.  So, while perusing the vast options one day, I added \"Mongols\" to it figuring that it was something that the hubby would like.  It has been a while ago, though, so I had sort of forgotten I had it on the list.  It arrived a couple of days ago and we watched it last night.Well, what can I say.  There was dialogue but it was in whatever language the Mongols speak -- Chinese?  It didn't sound Chinese.  There were subtitles.  The entire movie was subtitled.  I am not a fan of subtitles but we went with it.  It was a brutal movie.  It was sad. It was long but it was pretty good. I didn't fall asleep in it which was good but it did have it's draggy moments.  At the end, when all the text was scrolling, it did explain that it was the story of Ghengis Khan which, truthfully, we didn't know.  I guess I need to read the synopsis a little more closely.  Anyway, would I recommend?  Yes, with reservation.  Like I said, it is brutal."},

Our thanks to Jathan of Glennscape for hauling large trees, dealing with rain and constant changes from us.Fairy Doors --This is coming to my house soon! I can't wait.  I have a perfect place in the new flower bed for it and it is going to be very cute!It is from www.miniature-gardens.com.  I have been doing some looking at fairy gardens on the internet and, while I don't think I am up for creating an entire village, I have always wanted a door (introduced to me by my Aunt Velma).  So, this one has been ordered and will be here eventually -- hopefully in time for fall because we don't want the pixies to get cold!Was it Me or my Grandmother?I am aging.  I know this from the obvious signs -- greying hair, wrinkles, an approaching milestone birthday, suddenly sort of liking the color purple which I always, ALWAYS assigned to \"old ladies\".  I did not, however, think I had an old attitude.  If I don't look in the mirror, I feel 19.  I still remember the words to the songs of my youth, I have a get up and go approach to life and I keep up with the here and now.  So, I was shocked last evening when I saw what I saw and when I thought what I thought and suddenly my age closed in on me and I felt old.AW and I were feasting on soup at one of our usual haunts and, being seated close to the door, we got a good look at all the patrons as they entered the eatery.  As I was sipping my soup I glanced to the side and saw some black flats with rather wide grosgrain ribbon attached at the back and lacing around the wearers ankle to be tied in a large black bow.  This wasn't a child's foot so I had to look up to see what was north of these outrageous bows.  What I saw was a 40-something woman dressed in -- her slip! It was a pink number that was either faded or tie dyed -- not sure which.  Under this little number she wore black undergarments and tied around her waist was a floral, floaty apron-like affair that tied in the back (with a large bow, I might add) and came to an assymetrical point to one side of the front. It only covered the front of this get-up, not covering her entire body so from the back she was dressed -- in her slip.I was shocked.  Of course, I had read about women wearing lingerie as outerwear, mostly in the evening and mostly black or white.  I never thought I would see someone parading around at the usual dinner time in a family restaurant dressed in this manner.  I was disgusted.  This woman looked intelligent, carried a status bag and had a trendy hairstyle.  I am certain she had something in her closet to wear that would have been more appropriate.Then I thought about my reaction --- it was certainly not one of hippness, trendiness, or acceptance.  It was an old woman's response -- I could see Grandmother Madge sitting there passing judgment on this woman and I realize then that my age was showing and I was equally appalled by THAT.So, in the world of fashion I would have to say \"to each his own\" but I would be remiss if I didn't say it was the most laughable thing I had seen in a long time and an enlightening moment to myself -- fight the aging a little harder because it is creeping up faster that I realize."},

My dad was sort of a renaissance man, or a rebel, a free thinker or maybe just plain stubborn but whatever adjective you use to describe him, boring would not be one of them.My dad was born in San Antonio in 1923 but lived in several different parts of Texas during his life.  He lived in Austin, Corpus Christi, Quemada, the hill country but his heart was always in San Antonio.He started working at a very young age as a radio actor.  At sixteen he decided to pursue a career in radio which he did until Uncle Sam decided differently.  He served with the US Army Communication Corp in the Pacific Theater during World War II.  Upon his return stateside he was fascinated by television and got into that as quickly as he could.  He was an announcer, a weatherman, an anchorman, an artist.  He built sets for such programs as \"Shock\" and \"Captain Gus\".  He had the privilege of interviewing many celebrities such as Raymond Burr and John Glenn.Being the creative sort, he was drawn to movies and took a stab at making a few himself.  One of his movies has been released after many years on DVD and one stands as a tribute in the garden of Frank Thompson.  Realizing that San Antonio was not the \"new\" Hollywood, Daddy returned to television only to leave again a few years later to enter the comic book world which was an enduring career that lasted until his death.He was all these things, actor, movie maker, tv personality, politician, and artist but to me he was just \"daddy\".  We were too much alike to always get along but I knew, and appreciated, that my homelife was a bit unusual.  I grew up with my dad on tv or my dad splicing movies in the back room or, instead of reading me a story, we talked Egyptology.  I wouldn't have had it any other way although I didn't realize that until much later in my life.To my kids he started out as \"Pop Pop\" but quickly turned into \"Banker\" and not for the obviously assumed reason.  He used to play superhero with my son -- my son being Aquaman and he would slosh into the \"bank\" and my father was \"the Banker\", hence the name Banker or Bank.  Nope, no Grandpa, PaPa or PopPop for him -- Banker fit him to a tee.  He nicknamed my daughter \"Breezy Wheezy Motor Mouth\" which stuck with her much longer than I am sure she cared for it to.  He absolutely adored my kids and was always there with a typewriter to take apart or to help build a Micky Mouse replica for school.  My kids were blessed in having an unconventional grandfather with a brilliant, artistic mind.I choose to believe that he knows how great the kids grew up to be, how fantastic and wonderful Nathan and Kathryn are and how I am  growing to  resemble him more every day.  And I choose to believe that he knows that we wish him a very happy birthday!"},

Of course, I got in on the tail end but it held my interest for a little while so I went to my video on demand service and watched the first episode.  I enjoyed it even though it is based on a drug-addicted, adulterous emergency room nurse that reminds me of Ellen.  I never thought of Edie Falco as an Ellen-esque person -- maybe it is the haircut.

She is a much more serious reader than I so her answers are going to sound much more intellectual than mine but I am going to give it a go.1.  What author do you own the most books by?  I probably have owned more V.C. Andrews books in the past but they have gone on to other owners now.  So, presently I have more Barbara Taylor Bradford or Maeve Binchy.2.  What book(s) do you  own the most copies of?  The Holy Bible.3.  Did it bother you that both those questions ended in a preposition.  Uh huh -- just not grammar feng shui.4.  What fictional character are  you secretly in love with?  Blackie from \"A Woman of Substance\" although it isn't much of a secret because Blackie equals Liam Neeson and I read the book after I saw the movie.5.  What books have you read the most times in your life (excluding picture books read to children i.e. \"Good Moon\" does not count. Well, if \"The Bumper Book\" doesn't count then I would have to say \"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\" by Shirley Jackson.6.  What was your favorite book when you were ten years old?  I think probably \"The Good Master\" by Kate Seredy.7.  What was the worst book you have read in the past year?  I haven't read any bad books because I make sure I like them before I start them.8.  What is the best book you have read in the last year?  Again, they have all been good but, if I have to pick one, it would be \"The Lace Reader\".9  If you could force everyone you tagged to read one book, what would it be?  I don't force people to do anything but I would suggest \"The Lace Reader\", \"The Memory Keepers Daughter\" and \"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society\".10.  Who deserves to win the next Nobel Prize for Literature?  Don't have a clue.11.  What book would you most like to see made into a movie.  Well, for the most part I think movies made from books are pretty deplorable.  If it could be done right, I would say that \"The Lace Reader\" has the most potential for being a good movie but, with that said, I think it could be really, really messed up.12.  What book would you least like to see made into a movie?  No doubt -- \"The Shroud of the Thwacker\".13.  Describe your weirdest dream involving a writer, book or literary character.  Uh, I don't dream of those things but I have had a couple of odd dreams about \"Animal Crossing\".14.  What was the most lowbrow book you have read recently?  None.15.  What is the most difficult book you have ever read?  Well, if we eliminate the World Literature textbook in college, I would have to say \"London\". It is not really difficult, just long and involved.16.  What is the most obscure Shakespeare play you've ever seen?  I don't think I have ever seen an obscure Shakesperian play.  Most everything I have seen has been movies or televised stage plays but they have been the most well known plays.17.  Do you prefer the French or the Russians?  I really don't like talking politics.  If talking literature, I would have to say that I haven't read much of either.18.  Roth or Updike?  Haven't read either.19.  David Sedaris or Dave Eggers.  Who?20.  Shakespeare, Milton or Chaucer.  Shakespeare.21.  Austen or Eliot?  Since I don't know which Eliot you are talking about I would have to say Austen.22.  What is the biggest or most embarrassing gap in your reading?  I am not embarrassed by my reading but I would have to say that I wish I had read more American classics. By that I mean authors like Hemingway -- not just McMurtry although I enjoy McMurtry a great deal. 23.  What is your favorite novel?  Too many to choose from.24.  Play?  Again.25.  Poem?  I like \"There is a Polar Bear in my Frigidaire\" by Shel Silverstein and I am not being disrespectful or trying to be flip -- I really like it and used to get such a kick out of it when reading it to  my kids.26.  Essay?  I haven't read an essay since college. See what I mean about lack of intellectual reading?27.  Short Story?  I have many favorites.28.  Work of nonfiction.  Aside from the Bible, I have read a book on the rosary and now I am reading one on the saints. 29.  Who is your favorite writer?  This is difficult to answer because I have many.  Jan Karon comes to mind first, Barbara Taylor Bradford, Maeve Binchy, Shirley Jackson and Grace Metalious.30.  Who is the most overrated writer alive today?  The Harry Potter chick.31.  Who is your desert island book?  It would have to be something by Jan Karon.32.  And, what are you reading right now?  Aside from the saint book, I am reading \"The Shroud of the Thwacker\" (banging head against wall).The Landscape Saga ContinuesIt is Monday, plants were supposed to be in but -- it rained which put everything back a day or two.

There were many comedic asides -- didn't know Eastwood could be such a funny, old guy.  The story line was great -- but sad.

The 44th anniversary to be exact! I remember it well -- he asked me out -- well, actually his assistant manager asked for him -- I said I needed to check with the parents -- I did, they said yes, then he told me he was on restriction so he had to see if he could get out of parental jail.  He did and we went to see \"Dr. No\" and \"From Russia With Love\" at the Olmos Theater, which can be seen here:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/lastpictureshow/25161634801.We double dated with a buddy of his named Ronnie Holland and a girlfriend of mine named Penny Kuykendall.  Penny and Ronnie were dating -- I heard LOTS of gossip -- but I had no idea that my new date knew him.  It didn't matter -- they didn't stay long anyway.I remember when I got home my mother asked if I had fun.  I answered in the affirmative.  Then she asked if I would go out with him again and I looked at her and said \"Mom, I am probably going to marry him\".  Well, seven years later I did -- 37 years ago next week.  Pretty profound for a 15 year old!And, we have always had a special place in our hearts for James Bond movies and have a sizeable collection, thanks to our son and daughter in law, and can revisit June 26th anytime we want!"},

I would have to say that the book that I have read that reminds me most of summer is \"Gidget \".  I read it during the summer -- I remember laying on my bed with the blue floral bedspread, with the windows wide open in the sweltering Texas heat because we had no a/c reading \"Gidget\".  Of course, the subject matter was \"summery\" because they were on the beach in California!I have to say that while I did read during the summer, I did the majority of my reading during the school year and even now identify reading with curling up on a cold day and getting lost in whatever I am reading.Shopping Day!It has been a while since I shopped for anything other than books and magazines.  So, today, in a weak moment, I decided to indulge myself.In a quest to try to provide treats for my diabetic husband, I am always looking for something that will not do him too much harm.  I always try to buy \"sugar free\" which usually falls flat -- his take on it is \"buy regular and I will just eat less\"  which usually falls flat as well.  So, after tasting some really pretty wretched all natural, hand-made, hand-packed pricy ice cream and finding it to be entirely too sweet for his eating plan I decided to make my own.  So, this morning I headed to my local Williams Sonoma and bought this --I haven't gotten it out of the box yet -- I hope there are some recipes in it -- and I have to find room in the freezer to freeze the thing but I feel like I will have much more control over the amount of whatever I decide to put in it.Then, I just couldn't stop there -- I had to have this from Target --I had been looking for a chicken fryer for sometime and, even though there is a brand new Ace Mart right down the road from me, I decided on this on.  I don't fry food very often but when I do I am always saying I need a deeper pan because I really don't like getting popped with grease.  Plus, it is big and I can cook all the shrimp for my hubby and me and one time instead of smaller batches. And----it has a lid -- I always need lids.  So, now I have to find a place for it as well. Sounds like a reorganization of the kitchen is in my future.Anyway, that was my morning.  All that and groceries bought before 11:30! What can I say -- I don't shop unless I know what I am going for, go straight there and get it -- no messing around.  Well, except for the books but that is a whole different blog!"},

It just never caught my attention even though my father was a comic book artist that drew LOTS of science fiction.  I don't know why I never tried it, I just didn't.

I did love those books but that is about the extent of my fantasy reading.However, I do believe that \"The Shroud of the Thwacker\" would fall into this catagory.I guess I am just more of a dramatic or historical fiction reader.

I am wondering if I should expand my horizons?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, June 16, 2009", "text": "Another Evening at Barnes and NobleIt seems my husband and I are magnetically attracted to book stores.  Last night we planned our whole evening around going to B&N -- when we were going, which restaurant was closest, what we were looking for -- well, what he was looking for.  I went with an open mind and I came home with quite a variety of goodies.I had received a gift card from my son and daughter in law for Mother's Day that I still had a balance on so I felt like I could splurge a little bit.  The first thing I looked at was the section with Monica Ferris books.  I have never read Monica Ferris but keep picking up her titles and giving them a look.  I went looking for her first title in the Needlecraft Mysteries -- \"Crewel World\".  I don't like reading things out of sequence so I figured that would be a good place to start.  Naturally, they didn't have it.  Nor did they have  the second, \"Framed in Lace\".  They did have a compilation of the first three titles in the series -- the two previously mentioned plus \"A Stitch in Time\".  Even though it was twice the price of the two individual copies it was a third less expensive than buying them separately -- buy one get one free so to speak.  Snatched it up immediately -- they only had one copy and I was sure everyone in the store wanted it!A couple of other titles caught my eye and I walked into the store and I decided to grab those, too.  The first is \"The Madonnas of Leningrad\" by Debra Dean.  It is the story of an aging woman who struggles to remember current details but can vividly recount her time in World War II Leningrad. It is the first novel for author Debra Dean and it boasts rave reviews from the like of Isabel Allende, NPR, USA Today, New York Times and the Seattle Post. The third book I picked up is \"Ghosts Among Us\" by James Van Praagh.  I don't know why I gravitate to books of this nature but I do.  I sat down and read a few pages before I added it to my stack and it caught my interest so I am going to give it a go.  It is a short book and will be an easy read. So, a few more to add to my ever growing stack of TBR's -- my husband didn't find what he was looking for -- something about automobile suspensions but I can't worry about that -- I have a lot of reading to do.#333nudity: rather notdomestic: goddess, divaburp: baby, clothbaby: burpdateline: tv show, newsretract: removesuppose:  guesssurreal: dreamyinfidelity: bad, cheattoken: affection, bus         \"The grim place was filed with every conceivable variety of brainstick unfortunate.

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, June 15, 2009", "text": "THE PLAN -- Day 1Today is the first day of MY cleaning plan -- an altered form of a popular tutorial on cleaning.  I am taking one area each day and cleaning -- each room should be completed once a week and, in my book, that is clean enough.  Today I started with my bedroom and bathroom.  It has taken me about four hours but that four hours included, mopping, vacuuming, dusting, gathering laundry, changing sheets, cleaning out from under my vanity and part of the closet.  It also included cleaning the tub which is jetted and requires running for 15 minutes with a mixture of bleach/dishwasher detergent and hot water.  It is then rinsed with plain water by filling the tub again and running for another 15 minutes.  So.. I don't know if four hours is good but it is what it is.  I took several breaks -- just can't focus on drudgery very well -- but, now I am done and I can reward myself with some fun time -- I think it will be reading time while I have some lunch.So, tomorrow -- the living area and kitchen/dining.  That is the largest area in the house so it might take a while but, maybe not considering it doesn't involve laundry and such.  Hmm..I feel accomplished -- sort of.What Dreams May Come -- AgainA previously posted, I had requested the movie \"What Dreams May Come\" from Netflix and when it arrived it was defective and I couldn't watch it.  I returned it for a replacement which came last week.  The movie was recommended to me by my son and I usually trust his judgment.  I had heard conflicting reports about it being depressing and \"ughy\" and all sorts of things which didn't deter me but rather made me want to watch it more.  So, I did.  Here is my take on it.The cinematography and special effects were outstanding.  They even managed to make Robin Williams looks convincingly younger - I need to find their make up person.  I have to say that Williams must have been taking his ritalin because he was CALM. I really like Robin Williams but find that his hyperactivity is sometimes a big overwhelming. That wasn't the case in this movie.I didn't find this movie to be sad. Or depressing.  I found it to be hopeful and uplifting. From the love story perspective it was a soulmate sort of thing.  From the parent/child perspective it was representative of things we all have done as parents -- and children -- that we have regretted and learned from, questions about how different the outcomes would be if we had made different choices -- all that real life stuff.  From a spiritual perspective I found it to be very hopeful.  It was boldly religious yet I was surprised about references to non-Christian beliefs until I realized that this wasn't necessarily a movie just for Christian beliefs. There were parts of it that I found boring.  A small teaser here -- there was just too much time spent sliding around in paint!  I won't say anymore, don't want to spoil it for those who may not have seen it.I would recommend it to anybody who isn't offended by religion or anybody who isn't offended by a couple of non-Christian references."},

I really hope the rest of June isn't like LAST June -- rained the whole month.  This is just not what summer is supposed to be like. Whine, whine, whine.What Niche Books Do YOU Read?I have always been a prolific reader -- in the past more so than now -- it was easier when my mother was doing the cleaning and cooking -- I had LOTS of time then.  However, now my reading goes in spurts but I still manage to get some in every day. When I say \"reading\" I mean anything -- magazines, books, how - to books.I guess the largest group of \"niche\" books I read would have to be needlework books -- either cross stitch or quilting.  That comes in all forms, magazine, online magazines, books -- I have a good sized collection of quilt books as well as a number of cross stitch pattern books and more magazines than I can find a place to store.  One of my favorite magazines is \"Piecework\" because of their articles on needlework history. In this group I would have to include blogs.  I read a number of needlework blogs -- two daily -- http://mymarkdesigns.wordpress.com and http://marykathryn.wordpress.com.  These are two very talented ladies in the field of needlework.  Their blogs are never disappointing.The second largest group of \"niche\" books would have to be cookbooks.  I have no clue why because I don't really like cooking but I like cookbooks.  Maybe somewhere deep down I WANT to like cooking. Nah.Following the cookbooks closely would be self-help books revolving mostly around diet.  Note to all -- the diet books don't work.  Just quit eating.  Really.  If you must follow a book I would have to say Bettheny Frankels book \"Naturally Thin\" would be a winner.  In a nutshell it tells you -- just quit eating.  Some of the self help books I read involve \"going green\" -- many in magazine form.  I believe in going green.  It is better, cleaner for everybody, cheaper in the long run and maybe the ol' planet will keep turning for a while longer if we all did our part.  Jumping off my soapbox now.The last but definitely not least \"niche\" books I read are religious books.  I read a lot of \"Christian\" fiction but I read a lot of non-fiction religiously based things as well.  Right now I am reading a Bible that I found that is broken up, like a diary, into passages for each day of the year.  It isn't in chronological form but rather each day has a passage from the Old Testament, the New Testament, Psalms and Proverbs.  The goal is obviously to read the entire Bible in a year.  Now, granted, reading it chronologically would make more sense but this way a person at least can read the entire thing and then go back later and re-read. It is written in modern language which I don't think is so great but, again, it makes it more readable and there are lots of footnotes and notations showing where the \"translations\" were coming from. I am also reading a book on the rosary -- the history, the meaning, the process.  It is very interesting and for us non-Catholics it clears up a lot of the misinformation that we were given in our non-Catholic churches regarding the Marian devotion.I love getting lost in a novel, being able to be someplace else, somebody else, living life vicariously through a book but it seems, as I am getting older, that I am reading more for knowledge -- how to do something, how to make things better, how to be a better person -- things like that."},

Why in the world have there been four earthquakes -- very small ones -- in the Johnson County area in a week.  Three of those were one a day for the last three days.

The county government has hired a geologist to try to get to the root of the problem but it seems they are getting more frequent and a bit stronger each time.  I don't know about you, but this doesn't sound good to me.  Texas -- tornadoes, hurricanes, floods -- yes, but earthquakes?  Let's hope this is just a fluke and not working into an ongoing problem.

So, in an effort to entertain myself, I went browsing through my video on demand selections.  It is disturbing how many titles on VOD contain some form of the word \"dead\" -- but I digress. I almost settled for \"He's Just Not that Into You\" but somehow I just felt the need to keep looking -- romance could be a great option over depressing but I wasn't convinced.  Then, I ran across \"Last Chance Harvey\".  While it is on my Netflix queue, I decided to \"buy\" it instead and I am very glad I did -- it was completely delightful!A romance, yes, but one that I am more able to identify with which means the characters were persons of \"a certain age\".  Emma Thompson was phenomenal.  I used to not like her much but as I am seeing her in more and more things I am beginning to admire her very much -- I would define her as the British version of Meryl Streep -- or close.  Dustin Hoffman played the American gentleman facing more than one crossroad in his life -- transition as he calls it -- and he was fantastic.  Of course, I have been a fan of Hoffman since his \"The Graduate\" days and he never fails to disappoint.I would recommend this movie without reserve.  Of course, people my children's age wouldn't enjoy it, probably, but I did and would -- and probably will -- watch it again.Unconscious Mutterings #332hockey:  pucktwirling:  baton, Nancy, bandMontreal:  AGAINbetter:  goodnew:  betterrally:  carsStanley:  toolsUSB: portscouted:  actors, college sportscough: uh oh"},

She chose to take up residence in an almost brand new retirement community for active seniors.  Every year they have a summer family get-together with a theme.  This year the theme was \"Fiesta\" which is something we are all familiar with being from San Antonio.  My husband and I went and had lunch outside and watched all the festivities -- there were children, teenagers, and even an almost brand new baby.  There was an adorable long-haired daschund and a very lovely  bischon friese.  There were pinatas! They were most unusual -- bags with a fragile bottom in them.  They were filled from the top and the children would pull streamers at the bottom to release the goodies.  They had a wonderful time and it was much better than bludgeoning some poor \"animal\" or cartoon character into giving over the goods.It was a beautiful day -- a little too warm and the serving line wasn't set up as well as it could be but we found a shady spot, enjoyed our fiesta food and declared it a good day.

Well, I discovered that it is now available on VOD with our cable company so I ordered it tonight.  We started it early so we wouldn't be falling asleep which was a wise idea but probably  unnecessary because I don't think I would have fallen asleep -- it was action packed but not draggy. It seems some action/adventure movies have more action than necessary to drag things out -- this one didn't.It was a great movie! Of course, everybody on the planet knows that I am partial to Liam Neeson and that had a lot to do with my opinion but it was good and I would recommend.  However, it deals with a particularly nasty subject -- abduction on foreign soil.  In this movie, Neeson's daughter, 17, begs to go to Paris with her friend.  Dad had doubts about the whole thing but allows her to go even after he found out she had been lying about the nature of the trip -- museum hopping -- NOT -- more like being a band groupie.  In any event, she wasn't even in Paris for twenty four hours until she and her friend found themselves in a very uncomfortable situation.  Well, retired government agent dad came to the rescue and all was well but there was a lot of drama getting there.I would recommend this movie -- it was well done, went fast, was not over bought on action, not hugely gory and, of course, it had Liam Neeson in it.

Been reading them over at JLSHall and think it looks like fun.The book I am taking an excerpt from is \"The Shroud of the Thwacker\" by Chris ElliottHere goes:\"I pray, good sir, repeat yourself, for the tempest rages too clangorously to allow me to hearken to your needs satisfactorily,\" replied the hot dog vendor in pretty much the way any hot dog vendor in New York City would reply today.  So that told me nothing.\"I am only a third of the way through this book but it is hysterical -- not a serious read by any stretch of the imagination!It is TuesdayI have never seen such a nondescript day in all my life.  It isn't good, it isn't bad, it just seems to be Tuesday. The day started out with well intentioned plans -- a trip to the car place to get my inspection sticker, a trip to the store to pick up a couple of things, and then a day of ironing.  As I got ready for the jaunt to the car place I heard the rumblings of the storms in the West -- I thought that was supposed to happen tonight -- did I really sleep through the weather last night.  Hmm. So, off I went and arrived at the car place just as the bottom dropped out of the sky.  It is a nice car place and they provide you with various hot drinks, cookies and a quiet reading room to wait out your stay -- I was there at 7:45.  I got my hot cocoa -- not bad considering it comes out of a machine -- no cookies -- and settled in with my book to while away a couple of hours.  The storm hit --- I settled deeper in the chair -- but it was all over in a second -- my wait not the rain.  Apparently nobody else was there and I was the first in line and they got done with the car in record time!  Yippee! So, I drive my newly washed ride out into the pouring rain through muddy puddles of standing curb water.  Ugh.  As I head for my house I realize I am looking head on at somebody coming toward me -- in my lane -- trying to pass someone who was going too slow.  Uh, hello, it is flooding out here -- slow down.  She missed me by inches and looked a little flustered to see somebody coming toward her but, hey, I was where I was supposed to be!  After that I was even more anxious to get home.  Had to stop at the store for a couple of things and finally got into my garage, looked out the door at the sunshine and blue sky!  Couldn't they have washed my car a little slower?  Darn."},

It was entitled \"Evening\" and had a big name cast -- Vanessa Redgrave, Natasha Richardson, Glen Close, Meryl Streep and Claire Danes.  With a cast like that you would expect it to be good and it did not disappoint. I can't really tell you much for fear of spoiling the plot but suffice it to say it involved a terminally ill mother (Redgrave) and her daughters (Richardson and I don't know the other one's name).  The movie is a series of flashbacks with Danes playing the young \"Ann\".  It was very well done but you had to watch it closely because you didn't want to miss any of the references to the past that impacted the present.The movie didn't strike me as being sad although it should have -- a terminally ill mother could bring back personal memories but it was so well done that you didn't really think about that part of it so much.  The thing that was completely bittersweet was the aged, ill mother leaving her daughter (Richardson) when, just a couple of short months ago just the opposite happened in reality. It was a very good movie, I would recommend it and I would watch it again.  I might would even purchase it for my personal collection.Outside my window I see a peaceful, quiet street.I am thinking about the errands I need to run today.From the learning rooms I am learning that maybe I am NOT cut out to be a handquilter.I am thankful for my family.From the kitchen I tried Christeans's pineapple pie on my family and they loved it!!

{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, May 28, 2009", "text": "Booking Through Thursday -- Is there a book you wish you could unread?  One that you disliked so thoroughly you wish you could just forget that you ever read it?Well, I would have to say \"no\" to this question.  In the first place, if I don't like a book in the first page or so, it never gets any further than that.  I am not the sort that can just sit down and read anything, I have to like it.There are, however, a few books that start out slow but I keep on going and, at the end of the day, they usually turn out to be can't-put-them-down-page-turners.  I do believe in giving a book a chance so in order for me to give it up on the first page, it has to be something that I am really not interested in or just doesn't grab me at all. There are a few books that I like, that I WANT to like but find getting through them similar to walking through quicksand.  \"London\" would be one of these books. I enjoy it while I am reading it but it seems like it just takes forever to read a page.  \"London\" is taking a sabbatical right now -- I will get back to it. I have never, however, read a book that I wish I hadn't read.Hand-piecing VS Machine PiecingI have been doing considerable thinking about things  -- things having to do with our way of life. I have been caught up in the \"green\" movement as of late and have noticed that AW is sort of joining in.  Of course, I don't have a wind turbine in my back yard -- the HOA would frown on that -- but I have been trying to concentrate on recycling, reusing, repurposing and that sort of thing.  I remember my mother telling me a little poem that was popular during the depression -- or was it World War 2 -- have no clue -- but I remember the poem well -- \"Use it up, wear it out, make do or do without\".  I think that is pretty pertinent to today, don't you? Maybe if the last couple of generations had paid more attention we wouldn't be in the shape we are in, trying to back track and undo and all that.So, what does that have to do with quilting?  Well, obviously, it could bring to mind using worn out clothing and such as quilts but what I was really thinking about was how our foremothers did things that we don't do anymore and wondering if we are better off for it?  I read an article recently about keeping in shape by keeping house.  It told about how women used to never have to go to the gym because they didn't have all the labor saving devices that we have now -- they hung out clothing and beat rugs (ok, I never saw my mother beat a rug), they prepared food without the aid of food processors, huge mixers, etc.  I mean, life was a  little more hands on, wouldn't you say?  Ok, about the quilting.I started thinking about how we quilt these days -- fancy machines, fancy cutters and self-healing mats, long arm quilting machines and all sorts of rulers, guides and gadgets to help us out.  Now, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't trade my Bernina for a needle and thread any day but I remember my grandmother and my great-grandmother (yes, I knew her well, she lived to be 103) sit and hand piece quilts to the music -- or the preacher -- on the radio. So, this morning, not feeling too perky, I decided to try it out.  I mean, my first quilt block, sewn at the knee of the aforementioned great-grandmother, was hand sewn with a needle like a dagger so surely I could get the hang of it.  So, a couple of scraps, a couple of needle jabs later, slight frustration with the fiddliness of the whole thing (but not any worse than with the sewing machine) I produced a completely lovely four patch.  It lined up!  The corners met perfectly!  It was soft and unstarched, unironed and it was beautiful (more than the first block sewn about 54 years ago).  I was more than surprised at the outcome.  I figured that it would have to be ripped out, it would be crooked, it would be SOMETHING!  It was, it was perfect and very satisfying.So, now the question has to be -- how do you relinquish all the new-fashioned gadgetry for the old-fashioned satisfaction of producing something so good with so little.  How do you put aside the need for instant gratification of producing a quilt in record time for the feeling of accomplishment with only a needle and thread.  How do you slow down?We have a lot in our lives and most younger women don't know any different but for those of us who watched our mother's mix a cake with a wooden spoon or watched our grandmother's quilt a blanket with only a needle, thread, and thimble or watched our neighbors plant lantana in empty coffee cans to decorate their old victorian porches (a particular habit of the same great-grandmother) I have say that \"new\" is great and I wouldn't trade it but I an appreciate it so much more by knowing \"old\".So, now, the question is -- do I actually REALLY try my hand at handpiecing an entire quilt?  Hmmm...maybe I will try just one more four patch and the answer will come to me."},

I love Door Pottery so a couple of weeks ago I decided to treat myself to a small vase to put on my dining table.  It is blue, small and understated.  I wanted something small yet unique to put in it.  I preferred something real.  So, off I go to my local Central Market and happen upon the perfect thing -- Pepper Berries.They were so pretty and smelled delightful -- apparently.  I brought them home and put them in the vase -- they were so cheery and colorful -- just the right pop of color to brighten up breakfast. Enter, the cat.The cat won't leave the pepper berries alone -- he rubs up against the vase (definite no-no), climbs on the table (sorry, not allowed) and now he has eaten the leaves.  I hope they aren't toxic, or should I say WEREN'T toxic -- they have now been removed and I am on a quest to find artificial pepper berries that don't scream painted styrofoam or plastic.

I have looked at the book but deferred to the movie -- I WILL be reading the book.  The movie headlined some our today's best actors -- Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes.  The young man that play a young Michael Berg was very good but I am not sure of his name -- should be better prepared when posting.  I digress.  At any rate, it was a disturbing movie from the beginning -- a late-thirty-something woman having an affair with a 15 year old boy -- made me a little uncomfortable.  The plot progressed beyond that, however, into an even more disturbing subplot -- Winslet's character, Hanna, having been an SS guard who is on trial for the murder of 300 people.  She is found guilty and lives out her life in prison.  Obviously, she and Michael had parted ways but they find each other again and, while I don't want to spoil the ending, let's just say that it is very bittersweet.  While the whole movie smacks of sadness, the end is somehow not so sad.  It just shows how we never really know how people affect one another lives -- this being an extreme, obviously. I would definitely recommend and this is the first movie, in a long time, that would prompt me to read the book."},

I must have been about twelve or thirteen when I read it for the first time and knew that it was different from any other biography that I had read before.  In the first place, it wasn't written about the past it was written in present tense and was the first time that I had had such a personal view of such tragedy and the person was approximately my age.  It was controversial yet not inappropriate and it opened up a world to me beyond my own walls.  Now, I had read other books about other countries -- I was partial to Kate Seredy's books and I inhaled anything to do with the United Kingdom.  \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" was completely different in that it was a real person and it happened only a decade before to a girl my age.  I could completely identify with her thoughts and feelings and empathized with her completely.

Have you had to curb your book buying habits until you can catch up with yourself?  Or, are you a controlled buyer, only purchasing books when you run out of things to read?Ha! This is sort of funny, actually, in a sick and twisted way.  Yes, I admit it, I am a book glutton -- is there a twelve step program for that?  I frequent the bookstores and love -- LOVE -- the bargain tables.  I have enough books to last for the next five years -- maybe longer -- since I am a very slower reader and now have become addicted to Animal Crossing which bites into the reading time.  Recently, I have had to curb my buying and I am proud of myself.  I went to B&N looking for a copy of \"The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane\" only to be told that it hasn't been released yet, come back in a couple of weeks.  So, I went looking and before I knew it, I had a couple of books in my hand plus several magazines.  I stopped, checked myself and put the books back -- I rationalized -- why should I buy something just because I was THERE -- just wait for what I went there to buy to begin with.  The magazines are a different story.  My husband purchased a book which he THOUGHT he had and I purchased a magazine that looked familiar and sure enough, we both had copies of them so it is apparent that we are both sort of literarily dysfunctional and it will require a return trip to B&N and who knows what sort of pandemonium might ensure then.Finally in Control Again!

AW came home, we quickly devoured the crockpot gourmet and settled down to watch the movie.  One of us was much more excited about the prospect than the other one.

However, since I have been watching copious amounts of movies lately, I thought a blog on that might be of interest.AW and I joined Netflix.  Well, I joined Netflix and he is just going along with me.  I joined it with some apprehension -- fear of the movies getting lost in the mail and me with no way to prove that I actually did send them back.  That hasn't been a problem, however.  So, when I joined I made a tentative list -- always subject to change with me, of course.  I tried to mix AW's favorites -- action adventure -- with my favorites -- classics (both tv and cinema) and girly stuff.  So, we have had a variety of things to choose from and our relationship has managed to survive ME choosing the movies.The first movie we received from Netflix was \"The Secret Life of Bees\".  It was good and I recommend.  Even AW enjoyed it.  Then we watched some old tv classics -- \"The Life of Riley\" and \"Our Miss Brooks\".  Ok, so AW didn't fare so well with those.  Since then we have viewed \"Pride and Glory\" and \"Bangkok Dangerous\".  I enjoyed \"Pride and Glory\" more than \"Bangkok Dangerous\" because Nicolas Cage was just too weird in \"BD\".  I like him but it seems like he is getting stranger and stranger in some of his movies.The next movie in my queue is not going to thrill AW at all.  He wouldn't go see it in the theater -- neither would DD or SIL (I asked -- he said no).

I clicked on it and  much to my surprise, it was Molly Bee.  Even more to my surprise, it took a moment for me to remember who Molly Bee WAS! I went completely brain dead.  Not good for somebody whose dad was a C/W disc jockey and who used to watch all the old country variety shows on tv.  Suddenly it clicked and I remembered Molly Bee -- a name I hadn't heard for years and years. So, sympathies to all involved with Molly Bee -- it is a loss."},

This is a collection of short stories, \"memoirs\" if you will, about a group of women who have been friends for years.  They lives are chronicalled for about the past 40 years through the events that have befallen them, both good and bad.  It is a short book and very well written.  The images created brought back fond memories of my growing up during these same years.  However, I found it to be depressing.  I think it was just the wrong book at the wrong time for me.  I would recommend reading a few of the pages prior to committing to this book but don't let my opinion stop you -- just not right for me at this time."},

I am already involved in the TBR challenge which is similar but, since I have two blogs I thought two blogs would be acceptable -- more than that is overwhelming to me.  So, I signed up for the RYOB challenge and, since overlaps are acceptable, my first book will be \"Our Kind\" by Kate Walbert.  I figure if I post on TWO blogs that I will be reading it, maybe I will feel compelled to finish it -- we will see. My goal will be 12 books for the year.  I know, that sounds like a meager amount and hopefully I will do better but, realistically, I would rather keep the number low and add to it as I go.  It could go much higher as I seem to get roped into reading children's books a lot as I am buying and collecting for my grandkids and like to see what it out there for them.At any rate, since I have been neglecting my blogspot blog for a while and don't really want to abandon it, I think I will use it for the RYOB Challenge.

Since I had to list three books I included \"The Night Watch\" by Sarah Waters,  \"Looking for Peyton Place\" by Barbara Delinsky and the Beverly Lewis Trilogy \"The Shunning\", \"The Confession\", and \"The Reckoning\". I chose this challenge because it gave me the most freedom to read what I want and since I like a vast variety of material, I felt most comfortable in this challenge.So, Happy Reading all you fellow TBRers!Happy           New             Year!"},

It was delightful and the animation was fantastic.So......I don't need to tell you that I have been waiting very impatiently for it's release today and I am proud to say that I was one of the first at my neighborhood Target to obtain the DVD.

Even though we have been flirting with the changing season for a couple of weeks, this morning the weather seems to have taken a turn around the corner.  At 39 with a brisk breeze, we have definitely rolled over to my favorite time of the year.  So, with fires in the fireplace and a stack of good books and needlework projects, I am ready to face the brisque weather and say that change is good!With early voting winding up this week and the election around the corner, another kind of change is on the horizon.  I think we all know how the tide is turning on the election but I guess we never know until it is a done deal.  I am anxious to see the effects of the election, whoever wins, on the stock market.  I will probably be up early on Nov. 5th just to watch it on the news!  Change can be scary, too.We also have daylight savings time to look forward to next Sunday.  I always feel better from November (formerly October) until April (now May?) -- I guess I really do need that extra hour back.  But, it just makes the autumn evening so much nicer getting dark earlier.  Again, did I mention this is my favorite time of the year? So, change is good when we can get some much needed rest and push aside the trappings of summer and cozy up for the winter ahead.  Hm....makes me want to bake bread.  Ok, so maybe I have had enough change -- I really don't want too much of a good thing!"},

Summers aren't like that anymore -- we roast for three months wishing our lives away waiting for a \"better\" season.  What a shame.

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, July 23, 2008", "text": "A Stitch In TimeMy interest in textiles, fiber art, quilting, needlecraft began a long time ago, sometime before the age of six.  My mother, grandmother, \"other\" grandmother and great-grandmother all had a hand in nurturing this natural-born fascination I had with handwork.  I think it must have come to me about the age of 5, all at one time, because each experience I had with some aspect of the needle arts/handwork transpired about that time.The first thing I remember is wanting to embroidery.  So, my mother went to the five and dime -- Winn's in San Antonio -- and bought me a pair of pre-stamped tea towels and the proper needle and embroidery thread and a wooden hoop.  I remember working on them, getting tangled up and never finishing them.  I kept them, with the intent to finish them, until I was grown and they somehow disappeared after a house fire.About the same time, I was completely taken with my \"other\" grandmother's (Granny) crafting skills and would wart her to death about including me.  I was especially fond of watching her weave potholders on those little red, metal looms with those awful nylon loops.  Finally, one day, she told my mother to go to Winn's and get me a loom and she would teach me.  My mother did and Granny did and to this day I still love those looms.  She would also cut old sheets into strips and macrame them about coat hangers and make wonderful padded hangers.  Some of these still exist -- I have two or three myself.  I know how to do it and one day I will make more.  Granny isn't my real grandmother, she was my aunt's mother-in-law, grandmother to JLSHall and they all lived across the street from us.  I, however, claimed her as my own.My own grandmother, the one Joy and I share, did gorgeous crochet and was an excellent seamstress.  She made costumes for Joy and me and she even produced two hand-made baby dresses for my children.  She decided she wanted to learn to knit so she and I went for knitting lessons and a place called \"The Knitting Bowl\" at the local mall.  I can't knit or crochet and apparently can't learn.  I got frustrated, she didn't, I gave her all my supplies and then I gave up.My great-grandmother, Granny Giles, was a pioneer quilter.  She made utility quilts for everybody in the family on a quilting frame hanging from the ceiling.  Her sisters, Lura and Ella made beautiful appliqued quilts.  This is where my love of quilting and fabric began.One evening, while visiting my Granny Giles, she and my grandmother were piecing quilt squares by the dim light of a single light bulb hanging from the ceiling of an old, victorian house.  I wanted to learn.  They gave me some tiny patches, a needle and thread and let me go.  When I was done and had received the appropriate praise for my accomplishment, I decided I wasn't done.  Fishing through the drawer on the treadle sewing machine I found some rick rack and sewed it around the edges of my square with a tail hanging off.  Well, it still wasn't done so, after more searching, I came up with a jingle bell -- the kind we used to sew into our petticoats at Christmas -- and I sewed it on to the tail of rick rack and pronounced it finished.  I kept it for years, until the house fire and it, too, disappeared.  But, my interest in quilting didn't.  Over the years since age five or six, I have dabbled in all sorts of needlework and have loved all of it.  I prefer hand quilting to machine but my hands aren't cooperating.  I love cross stitch but am now working \"in hand\" becausethe same contrary hands balk at trying to hold on to hoops.  I have tried my hand at \"art quilts\" and have even produced an ACEO quilt.  It doesn't matter to me, though, as long as I am doing something with needle/thread/fabric."},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, July 22, 2008", "text": "Reader Rantings --\"The Bumper Book\"In my opinion, reading is, by far, the best pasttime.  It is portable, if you read in the daytime it doesn't require electricity, you can read as long as you want or stop when you want -- not subject to network programming schedules and definitely NOT preempted by a \"special report\" and, if you use the public library systems (which we all should do), it can be free.  What more could anybody want in the way of entertainment?I was a voracious reader as a child and young adult and my love of reading was \"inflicted\" on my children because I began reading to them the moment they were born.  We would visit the library every two weeks, tote home armloads of books and read and re-read our favorites.One of my favorite books was \"The Bumper Book\" by Watty Piper and illustrated by Eulalie.  It was published in 1946 by Platt & Munk.  To my young eyes, this was the most gorgeous book imaginable.  The illustrations are very old-fashioned, rich, colorful and interesting -- the more you look at them, the more you see.  The stories and the verses are familiar and can be read over and over again.This book is, sadly, out of print. It can be obtained, for a pretty penny, on Ebay but I found a copy at our local antique mall.  I just felt that our Moochi would lose out if he didn't have a copy of this book so I searched until I found one.  I think I got it for a reasonable price (define reasonable!) of under $50.  It was in pretty good shape and I was pleased that I was able to find it.I have read the book to Moochi several times and while I think he enjoyed it I know I did! Everytime I read the alphabet verse I get tickled and I still know \"Christopher Robin\" by heart -- such wonderful memories -- every child should have them!So, the next time you are looking for a special gift for a child, try to find a copy of \"The Bumper Book\".  It might not be perfect anymore but that worn cover will just be an indication of how much it was loved and used by a child before."},

Like spring and fall and good enchiladas and great movies and a drive in the country?  Well, my DVR is on that list.  I always liked my VCR and the first one we had was fantastic -- easy to program, etc -- and the last one we had was, well, not. So, when we acquired DVR, I just knew I would love it and I do. I go through the tv listings and program away and there is always something to watch.  With that said, however, I had to delete all my \"Baby Borrowers\" because that show is just too painful!I digress.Last night, A was at his bosses house for a yearly shindig -- spouses not included -- so I was home with my frozen pizza and DVR.  Not a bad combo, if I do say so myself.  So, I went flipping through my line up and settled on a movie that I had seen in the bookstores but wouldn't let go of the cash to buy.The movie is \"The Secret of Roan Inish\".  It is the story of a little girl, Fiona, who is born on the island of Roan Inish and whose mother dies with the birth of her younger brother. During the course of the movie, the baby drifts out to sea in his cradle, the family leaves the island, the father can't cope with the loss of his wife and child and Fiona is sent to live with her grandparents who had also left Roan Inish due to lack of work.  Life on the mainland, Donegal, Ireland, is steeped in folklore and  beliefs and Fiona learned them all and believed in them.  She is also fascinated by the seals that inhabit the waters around the area.  On a trip to the island with her grandfather, Fiona bonds with the island and also discovers that the island is not completely deserted.  As the movie progresses, Fiona learns the secret of Roan Inish and she and her cousin set about reuniting her family with their beloved homeplace and opening up the secret.I won't tell you the secret but I will say that it has a very happy ending.  I didn't know what to expect from this movie but it is delightful.  The setting is beautiful, off the coast of Ireland.  The actors, unknown to me, were very good.  The story was endearing.  A bit of reality, a bit of fantasy, it held my interest and I will probably be buying it for my DVD library because it is something I would watch again.Friday Fill-Ins1.

Do you have favorite bookstores that you only get to visit while away on a trip?  What/where are they?\"I don't vacation much -- A travels for work so his idea of a vacation is NOT traveling.  However, we do enjoy short trips from time to time -- mostly to the San Antonio area.  I have been to Arkansas and California but I was a child so this question really doesn't apply.  With that said, however, I spent some time in Dallas in 1961/62 when my dad was doing some film work here and the one thing I did buy was a copy of \"Tom Sawyer\" at a drug store.  So, I guess I did begin the practice of buying vacation books then.Yes, I do buy books when I am vacationing.  The last trip to San Antonio I bought four books dealing with local history.  I had been looking for those sorts of books for some time but I hadn't been able to find any north of Austin so when I discovered them in a bookstore -- Betano's -- on the Riverwalk, I seized the opportunity, bought four and then picked my DH up off the floor when I handed him the receipt for $134.  In my opinion, it was well worth it to sort of round out my local history section of my personal library.While visiting in and around Texas, I don't really have a favorite bookstore -- I mean, B&N and Borders is the Starbucks of the literary world -- they are on every corner so it isn't difficult to find a place to buy a book but I do like to frequent book areas in museums and gift stores of tourist sites.  For instance, when I visited the UK, I hit every bookstore/gift shop in every tourist place I went.  I have to say the sales people at the gift store at Westminster Abbey were more than thrilled that I visited there!I find books to be the best sourvenir of a vacation, followed closely by art work and postcards.  So, yes, I do buy books while on vacation.Gone but Not Forgotten -- My Genealogical SearchAside from my family and my faith, I have four interests in my life -- quilting, cross stitch/embroidery, reading, and genealogy.  I wouldn't call them passions, I am passionate about my family and faith but I would say that I am drawn to these activities from somewhere deep inside.  They are activities that have rooted themselves in me, planted and encouraged by others and I find no better way to spend my \"alone\" time .The two activities that have the deepest meaning to me are genealogy and quilting and they are linked.  My interest in quilting began with my great-grandmother, Maggie.  One evening in her home, watching her and my grandmother hand piece quilts was the most fascinating thing I had ever seen.  They even let me join in and the fire was fueled forevermore.This same great-grandmother was the basis for the love of genealogy.  My father's family had always held family history in geat esteem and had kept the family story alive.  I grew up hearing historical accounts of my family's migration from Tennessee to Texas in covered wagons.  I learned about our family's place in the founding of this country and this government.  It was pretty awesome as a child and the interest never left me.  In fact, it just expanded to include my maternal family and my husband's family, as well.I have decided that  this blog is a good venue for  collecting and sharing  these stories, maybe some photos, for family members that might be interested either now or in the future. A few of the names that I research are Boyett (and all variations of the spelling), Cocke, Watkins, Conn, Davies/Davis, Webb, Palmer, Brinkley, Rantz.  This isn't a complete list but the most immediate list.  The areas that I research are Texas, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, England, Wales.So, if you are interested, come back and join me on my travels through my family search."},

The first that I have read is \"A Journey to the New World -- The Diary of Remember Patience Whipple -- Mayflower, 1620.\"The book is written in a diary format which makes it very easy to read.  The main character is Remember Patience Whipple, a young girl of about twelve.  The book is an account of \"Mem's\" journey across the Atlantic, the landing at Cape Cod, and the building of the Plimoth Settlement.  The depictions are graphic enough to get the point across but not so graphic to be unsuitable.  The language is a bit advanced to be realistic for a young girl in that time period but it reads well. The things that I enjoyed most about the book were at the end! The epilogue, of course, finished the story of Mem and how her history evolved.  Then, there is an addendum entitled \"Life in America in 1620\".  This is comprised of actual historical facts as well as pictures, census of sorts, maps and a copy of the Mayflower Compact. I would recommend this book for ages 8+.  It is a tidy little book, great cover, hard-bound with a ribbon bookmark.  Very suitable for a library shelf.  I am going to donate this copy to my daughter's 8th grade American History classroom."},

I was feeling lonely and left out so I went on a quest to find a companion for myself -- one that be slipped into a purse or bag and doesn't require prescription pet food from the vet.I visited several places looking at Lil Kinz.  Then I looked at Beanie Babies.  They were all cute but none were \"speaking\" to me, drawing me in.Then, on Friday while shopping at Central Market, I heard a voice -- a small voice which came from a wooden shelf near the cosmetics area.  There, on the bottom shelf was a little Jellycat sheep.  He didn't have a name, the tag just said \"Sheep tot, please take care of me\".  Well, how could I pass that up -- no name and a pleading note?  I mean, really, ME, the nuturing freak of the world.  So, I checked his \"pursability\" and didn't get arrested for shoplifting so into the basket he went.  I think the check out boy thought I was crazy as he set my newly purchased buddy on the check writing stand and grinned at me as only a twenty-something male with Fabio hair can do. I felt old and crazy but was happy with my decision to adopt this diminutive sheep.  A name.  What is in a name?  Well, everything.  Our identity.  This little sheep had no identity except that he is part of the Jellycat family and he hails from the UK.  That is a good thing since all my ancestors do too -- he will fit in nicely.  So, the first thing that I thought of what the name my father gave my fledgling craft company -- Tinklepaw -- and since he is a \"Tot\" I have named him Tinklepaw Tot.  So, here is my new family member~"},

The photos I am sharing tonight are of the San Pedro Public Library.  My first experience with the library system was at this library, which is located in the historic San Pedro Park.  Usually the end of the school year was celebrated with a picnic at a local park.  In May, 1959 our picnic was at this particular park and at the close of the picnic our teacher and parent volunteers marched us to the library to get a tour.  Those of us who were already eight years old and had a parent with us were able to get a library card.  I was thrilled because I was an avid reader and, with the long summer ahead, I knew I would make good use of that card. That visit began a life-long affection with books and libraries and this library in particular. For some reason, when I visited the library in April, I was struck by this water fountain.  It is original and I remember the water being very cold.  As a child I didn't take much notice of this necessity but as an adult, seeing it again after at least 40 years, I saw it for the piece of architectural art it really is.  For some reason, it struck a sentimental note and I was sorry that it was no longer operational but it does make a lovely planter.The final photo I would like to share is that of the children's section of the library.  It is no longer the children's section -- it is now the adult section and the children's section is currently where the adult section USED to be.  I spent many afternoons in the far, right hand corner seeking out my favorite books -- usually a Kate Seredy or a Lois Lenski.  It seems that all my favorite were clustered together and as I visited this time I went straight to that corner looking for them but they weren't there.  Realizing the flip-flop of the arrangement I headed for the other end -- they weren't there either.  When did Seredy and Lenski fall out of favor? Could I really be that old?  Well, yes, I could and changes are inevitable but I think there is still room in our lives for the old books and I think it is a shame that they aren't there, even in the far corner.So, that is where my love of reading began.  It was the greatest thing in the world to go to the library after school on a cold, blustery fall day (yes, it does get cold and blustery in the fall in south Texas) and bring home a handful of your favorites and curl up on the couch and just let yourself get lost in the story.  One of my greatest memories of all time.Unconscious Mutterings1.  intimidated:  scared2.  brush:  Hair3.  masquerade: ball4.  procedure: avoid5.  tattoos:  nasty6.  square: peg7.  tuck: nip8.  boyfriend: Charles9.  badass:  cool10. thousand: dollars, Anne of a Thousand Days"},

{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, July 10, 2008", "text": "Booking Through ThursdayOne of my favorite bookstores burned down last weekend and while I only got to visit there while I was on vacation it made me stop and think:What would you do if, all of a sudden, your favorite source of books was unavailable?Whether it's a local book shop, your town library, or an internet shop...what would you do?  If it was a local business would you try and help out the owners?  Would you just calmly start buying from some other bookstore?  Visit the library in the next town instead?  Would it be devastating?  Or just a blip in your reading habit?Hmmm....this question certainly paints a vivid picture of an idyllic small town where residents can actually walk to the town center, where there are still locally owned businesses and where the impact of something so devastating as a fire in the local bookstore could actually affect the town economy maybe prompt residents to rally together in a socially conscious effort to help.Back to reality -- I dont live in a place like that.  We have neighborhoods, most certainly, but the concept of mom and pop stores is almost non-existent, except in a few cases.  So, one would have to assume that, in my case, we are talking about B&N or Borders.  Well, since they are like Starbucks and are positioned just a few miles from each other and other branches of the same store I would have to say that it wouldn't make much of an impact on me personally because I frequent all of them.  Of course, this could bring us into conversation about the effects of big business on our lifestyle -- especially for those of us old enough to remember the independently owned business of our youth and who still prefer them. That, however, is a different blog.If the library were to burn down -- now, that is a different subject.  Yes, I could visit another branch but the impact that it would have on the neighborhood environment would be much more important.  The children of the neighborhood, as well as the older folks, would be impacted greatly and I would be supportive of efforts to rebuild.  Regarding the library, I don't frequent the library enough.  I am a slow reader so I tend to purchase my books so that I am not rushed by deadlines.  However, I do like to donate books to the library since our library has resale shops that help sustain the system.   If we DID have an independent bookstore that I visited regularly which, if we DID have one I would,  I would certainly try to help in anyway I could to put it back! We have lost enough of these sorts of businesses as it is but they seem to have just disappeared, evaporated not destroyed by some natural disaster -- just a big sucking sound made by big corporate entities.As far as the internet goes -- well, I have to admit that you can buy anything from Amazon and if it disappeared, I don't know what would replace it.  However, with that said, I browse ebay from time to time and there is an elderly gentleman from down South Texas way who can pretty much supply me with anything I am looking for so, I would continue to correspond with him.  At the end of the day the fact is, I am a reader and I would find some venue to feed my habit. I mean, just looking at my reading habits from childhood  show adjustment and adaptation. I went from the classroom library shelf to the public library.  Then, I discovered the paperback racks at our local convenience store and grocery store.  Now, in my mid years the bookstores are a comfortable place to spend the evening and the internet is always open.  So, all these changes have taken place in the last 50 years -- we adjust and I am sure we will continue to do so.  My suggestion would be, however, is to put a sprinkler system in all the bookstores across the country so we wouldn't have to suffer such devastation to one of our most precious resources."},

I haven't lived there for the last eighteen years but everytime I return I long to stay yet know I never will again.  My last trip to SA was in April.  My husband, who still does business there, had a meeting so I tagged along. He took some vacation time and we made a long weekend of it.  Of course, my over productive genealogy gene won't let me get out of the city limits without some form of documentation of my life there.  In the past, I have trekked through cemeteries, scoured libraries and cursed myself for not going to the health department to retrieve vital statistic records for every one of my relatives.  This time, however, I decided to do something different.  I decided to photograph places that were of some importance to me during my years there.  Most of these places don't look like they did during my childhood and most have different purposes now.  Sadly, a number of significant places in my growing up time just aren't there anymore at all. Most of these places are very old and time hasn't been kind to them.  However, I think it would be fun to share these photos in my posts here.  I might even throw in some from past visits.  We stayed at the Marriott Rivercenter which is a lovely hotel right on the San Antonio River.  In fact, the River is accessible from the lobby of the hotel.  We were on the 15th floor so I was able to get this lovely picture of downtown San Antonio.  It just so happened that we were there during the week of Fiesta de San Antonio.  Fiesta is a week long celebration honoring the heroes of the Alamo.  It began in 1891 when a group of citizens decided to honor both the heroes of the Alamo and those of the Battle of San Jacinto with a \"Battle of Flowers\"  -- a parade where floats were bicycles and horse drawn carriages that were decorated with flowers.  Over the years it has expanded into several parades including a night parade called The Flambeau, The River Parade and The Battle of Flowers Parade.  There are other activites going on also such as A Night In Old San Antonio -- a food fest in La Villita -- the original San Antonio and the carnival.  Below is a picture of the carnival as taken from our room.  Fiesta has a Queen with a Court made up of the young women from old society families and every year a King is crowned King Antonio.  In my youth, he would go to all the schools and give out King Antonio medals to all the school children.  I think I still have one but I don't know if he does that anymore.  So, just click on the photos for a larger view and enjoy!\"The Outcasts of 19 Schuyler Place\" by E. L. KonigsburgFor another entry in the Young Readers Challenge I have completed \"The Outcasts of 19 Schuyler Place\" by E. L. Konigsburg.  This book is about Margaret Rose Kane, her two great uncles Morris and Alexander Kaplan, the towers and probably the most eventful summer in Margaret Rose's life.  It begins with her first visit to summer camp.  Her parents had gone to Peru for an archaeological dig -- and other things -- and had planned to leave Margaret with her great uncles for the month.  Margaret stayed with her great-uncles a great deal and even had her own room so she was looking forward to the stay.  However, her uncles suggested camp.  It didn't go well.  Margaret was rescued my her uncle to remain in their care for the duration of her parents absence.  She loved her uncles house because it was special -- it had the towers.  The towers had always been there and were magical. And there was Tartufo, the dog that had come from Italy and her new friend and conspirator, Jake.  The story is centered around the changing town of Epiphany -- urban renewal and renovation -- and how the new \"neighbors\" didn't think the towers were appropriate for the new look of \"Old Town\" Epiphany.  The uncles had fought the city council decision to have the towers demolished but it took Margaret, her mothers childhood friends, her camp enemies, her new friend Jake and Tartufo to turn things around, make everybody happy and save the towers for future generations.  There were things, however, that couldn't be saved and some very ironic twists but I won't tell you about them, you will have to read the book yourself.This book is labeled for 10 yrs. and up but Konigsburg has such mature characterization that I think more like 12 -14 would be a good starting point.  I completely enjoyed the book and didn't feel like I was reading a children's book.  The characterization is impeccable, the settings so well depicted that you recognize them immediately, the mood is consistent with the action and flow.  It is a good read and I would recommend it for the aforementioned age group as well as adults.Unconscious Mutterings (284)1.  notification:  principals office, information2.  cheat:  game, test3.  top ten -- those record rating sheets we used to get from the record stores that came out on Friday or Saturday4.  draft: beer, board, pattern, quilting5.  unbelievable: my age6.  cheap: nothing7.  spontaneous: fun, trip, outing8.  harass:  annoy, bother9.  lipstick: ugh10.  transpire: happen, eventHmm....these all sound like definitions!

Well, I guess, theoretically we COULD do it but it wouldn't be the same.  There was just something about playing outside in the hose/sprinkler -- not worrying about getting sunburned or washing off the sunscreen, not worrying about germs but tasting how great that cold water was out of that hose, laying on big towels drying off in the sun, eating cherry tomatoes that Granny grew just outside that fence.  Life was good in 1956.Happy Anniversary to me -- Again!Today is my wedding anniversary.  A and I have been married for thirty six years.  We \"went together\" for seven years before that so we have been in each other's lives for forty three years.  My, that sounds like a very long time.  But, it has been good.  We have been healthy, have two healthy, accomplished kids, one really cute little grandson and a granddaughter on the way.  Life has been good to us.However, looking back over the \"special day\" I think of all the things I would have done differently.  I wanted a different kind of wedding -- I wanted a private wedding with just parents, immediate family, jlshall and M and then have a big, party like reception.  I wanted to wear a short dress and preferably no veil.  However, A and my mom thought I would regret it if I didn't have a traditional wedding and reception so we carried on with their plans.  Now, thirty six years later, I still like my original plan and, if I could do it over again, I would have my way.In thinking back over the way things went, however, if I absolutely had to have a traditional wedding, I would still change some things.  I wouldn't get married on the  fourth of July weekend.  People complained that it conflicted with plans like barbecues and trips to the lake.  I wouldn't wear a long sleeved dress in July in South Texas.  Why?  Well, it is inevitable that with a l/s dress in July, the a/c in the church would break down, now isn't it?  It did.  I would choose a photographer whose pics wouldn't change colors.  Now, of course, these pictures are in b/w because my scanner is a b/w scanner but they are in color.  The bridesmaids wore lovely peach colored dresses and white gloves and cute bows in their hair.  They were all a little past the \"bow\" age but hey, it was the early 70's, bows were popular.The one thing I wouldn't change is the groom.  He is a good guy and takes really good care of me and always has.  So, I guess, at the end of the day, where  it happened, when it happened and how it happened doesn't really matter -- the only thing important is that it DID happen.The first photo is of my bridesmaids -- l to r : My cousin, Penny; Sheila, A's sister; me; JLSHall (also cousin to Penny); and the little one is Sheri -- the flower girl who didn't want to throw the flowers -- typical.The second photo is obviously of DH and me."},

A person who reads everything in sight -- a voracious reader -- while maybe not particularly discriminating, is still reading and probably a great deal.  A person who reads BOOKS is indeed a reader.  A person who reads for school or work is also a reader.  However, when I think of a \"reader\" I think of a person who truly loves to read, regardless of the genre.  I think of a \"reader\" as one who becomes involved with the characters and plotlines and plunges into the story (or article) completely.In my opinion, a \"reader\" is someone who is passionate about the pasttime, regardless of what he/she is reading but gets into it, enjoys it, looks forward to the next adventure and realizes that the ability to read is a life changing gift.  \"Like the specific person who is reading something you wrote\".

It is a very cozy, comfortable book depicting the lives of several village dwellers in the fictional Thrush Green which is the neighboring village to Fairacre of her first series.The book is centered around the traveling fair that came to Thrush Green every May 1.  It details the interactions of the villagers with the travelers as well as with each other.  There is young love as is seen with Molly Piggot and Ben Curdle and old love as evidenced by Dr. and Mrs. Bailey.  There is comedy involving Ella Bembridge and Dimity Dean that is reminiscent of Hyacinth and Elizabeth (if you are a fan of Britcoms, you know what I mean).  There is loss --\" \"I'll take those flowers to the larder shelf,\" said Mrs. Bailey, advancing upon them.  \"No,\" said her husband and something in his voice made her turn and look at him.  He sat very still and his face was grave. \"I'd like them left out.\"  Mrs. Baily could say nothing.  \"We shan't see the old lady again,\" said Dr. Bailey. \"I doubt if she has three months to live.\"\"  There is controversy as seen in Molly Piggots drunken, abusive father but none of the negatives are presented in such a way to mar the general impression that this is an uplifting book.This book is a fast read because the reader is drawn into these characters lives -- it is like you are sitting on the village green watching their days unfold.

So, I will continue to add to my list of completed reads.My latest completion is \"The Spiderwick Chronicles, Book 2, The Seeing Stone\".In this book The Grace Children, Mallory and twins Simon and Jared continue to explore the rickety, ramshackle house they have moved into that actually belonged to their grand-aunt.  Simon isn't too concerned with the discovery of the secret library and the books by the patriarch Mr. Arthur Spiderwick concerning the existence of faeries, that is, until he goes missing!  In the previous book, the children are introduced to a brownie named Thimbletack and in the second book, Thimbletack is responsible for helping Mallory and Jared find Simon who had been kidnapped by the goblins.  Thimbletack gave Jared the seeing stone -- a stone with a hole in the middle of it that, when looked through, allowed Jared to see the goblins that were, otherwise, invisible to him.It was a perilous effort finding Simon, encountering a troll and sprites and a band of goblins along the way.  When they finally arrived at the goblin camp they found Simon trapped in a cage along with many cats, a goblin with green cat eyes and an injured griffin that they took home to nurse when the whole ordeal was over.  A battle ensued in which Mallory had to make use of her fencing sword but, at the end of the day, the children made it back to their home where their mother was very concerned about their disappearance -- it was, after all, 1 a.m.These books are well written, although a bit gross in areas.  However, they are drawing me in and wanting me to read the next installment.  The illustrations are great and I am enjoying them.  I would recommend them to the older ages in the group and I would try to find them in discount stores or second hand bookstores because they are a little pricey at the big name stores -- especially since they can be read in about an hour."},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, June 07, 2008", "text": "Booking Through ThursdayHave your book tastes changed over the years?  More fiction?  Less? Books that are darker and more serious?  Lighter and more frivolous?  Challenging? Easys?  How to books over novels?  Mysteries over romance?I honestly have to say that my taste in books has stayed pretty much the same, just more grown up versions. As a child I read a great deal and the children's books I read the most were those that took me out of my time period or my locale and now, I real lots of books that are historical fiction or at least are set in a different place.  I also read a lot of family based, generational books.  A good example of that is \"A Woman of Substance\" or some of the Beverly Lewis serialized books.I still read a lot of fiction but I do read non fiction too.  My favorite non fiction reading is genealogically based and I love reading about British royalty.  I am very much an Anglophile so that is always something that attracts me.  As a child, I was completely taken with the new World Book Encyclopedia set that I received and would sit for hours reading the encyclopedia and was quite content to do so. For Christmas I received a copy of the Archaeological Bible which I am finding very interesting except the type is very hard to read.I am generally not great with dark, serious reading but I did like \"The Memory Keepers Daughter\" which was a bit dark and, in my opinion, pretty serious.  Last night at the bookstore I was eyeing a new V. C. Andrews series but, after reading the first chapter, I decided to put it off for a while.  The early Andrews books (\"Flowers in the Attic\") were pretty good but the later series, after her death, I find to be disturbing, so I passed on it.I have never really considered whether I read challenging books over easy books, I guess I read both.  However, with the Young Readers Challenge I am reading many childrens books -- I can't seem to stop, actually -- and some of them are easy but they are still really interesting.  Right now I am reading \"The Spiderwick Chronicles\" and it is very easy to read -- I can get through one of the books in about an hour -- but it is really good.  Great writing, good illustrations -- it is all there but I guess it would be considered easy. Some of the children's books that I have read are simple but not simplistic.  They handle very serious subject matter and are well written.  They are easy to read but the subject matter is such that they are serious to controversial depending on the age group you are looking at.Yes, I read how-to books.  I read lots and lots of needlework books.  I have read Joyce Meyer's book \"100 Ways to Simplify Your Life\" -- good advice even for the non--religious.  Romance? Mysteries?  When I was younger I read a lot of what would be considered romance although I wasn't a big Harlequin fan.  I haven't read it much in the recent past but, because of a new challenge, I will be starting again.  I am not sure how it will go.  I like certain types of mysteries.  \"The Haunting of Hill House\" and \"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\" are mysteries to me.  I haven't read many real mysteries like Miss Marple, etc. but I would like to.Generally, it is a rare occasion that I can be found without a book in hand, or at least nearby.  When I was growing up in the 50's and 60's, we had three television channels.  Sounds bad?  Well, not really because tv watching didn't take up all our time.  We had the time to read and did a lot of it -- a favorite pasttime in the long, very hot summers of South Texas.  I found that books were always available, thanks to the library, that you didn't have to wait for them to be \"scheduled\", you didn't have to dvr them, you could \"rewind\" them and read parts over and over again, you could take them with you and often did, you could imagine the scenery, people, places, etc. without having somebody think it up for you -- the perfect diversion.Friday Fill-InsOk, I know it isn't Friday but I am off a day -- or two.  I will do Thursday's thing in a little while.1.  Idle hands are the devils playground, or something like that.2.  I love Aveeno Colloidal Shower Gel in the shower.3.  My favorite time of day is when A nudges me from my chair slumber and says it is time to go to bed -- usually right after the Leno monologue or maybe the Leno headline funnies.4.  The last tea I drank was Stash Peppermint Herbal decaf, last night before my chair slumber.5.  I like to stay inside during the summer.6.  My mother always said \"don't do anything to embarrass me\".   I didn't -- she wasn't. 7.  And as for the weekend, tonight I am looking forward to absolutely nothing, tomorrow my plans include going to the gun show, and Sunday I want to go to church and celebrate A's birthday with my family."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, June 02, 2008", "text": "TAGGED AGAIN! SIX RANDOM THINGS ABOUT ME1.  My father made a movie once and I had a part in it as a screamer -- off camera. 2.  I feel that my junior high school years were my favorite school years.3. I used to paint ceramics.4. When my children were small, I took a creative writing correspondence course because I have always wanted to be a writer.5.  I have always wished I could draw.6.  I can't quit buying quilt fabric or embroidery floss -- it is a sickness!TAGGED!Yay! I have been tagged! This is my first tagging and I am thrilled because I love, absolutely love, all these questionnaires and bulletins and things.  So, here goes!1.  Who is your all time favorite author and why?This is difficult to answer because I have several authors that I gravitate toward which is bad, because I probably ignore many others that would be very good.  Jan Karon comes to mind immediately.  The Mitford series was very captivating for me although some reviewers found it to be milque toasty.  I loved every minute of it and couldn't wait to get the next book. Barbara Taylor Bradford is another favorite.  I thoroughly enjoyed all the \"Woman of Substance\" series. I will also read and re-read Shirley Jackson.  While I read \"The Haunting of Hill House\" more than once, I really enjoyed \"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\" more.  I received my first copy of it for Christmas when I was about 14 and loved every page of it.  I can't leave out Grace Metallious of \"Peyton Place\" fame.  I seem to really like books that are soap opera-like.  Doesn't say  much for my reading taste, does it?2.  Who was your first favorite author and why?  Do you still consider him or her among your favorites?I think the first author that I remember being struck by was Kate Seredy --\"The Good Master\".  Every year we had required reading lists -- a thing of the past, I am sure -- and she was the first author that I remember reading most of her books.  I really enjoyed her books because they took me into a different culture than my own and I found her descriptions -- mostly of the clothes -- to be quite enchanting.  While I haven't read her in a good number of years, I am looking to collect her books if I can find them of the same vintage that I read them.Other authors that I enjoyed as a child were Doris Gates \"Blue Willow\" and Lois Lenski \"Strawberry Girl\" and I do have those books in my library.3.  Who is the most recent addition to your list of favorite authors and why?Well, I have to say that Barbara Pym, introduced to me recently by JLSHall is a new favorite as is Miss Read.  I am enjoying them because they write \"comfortable\" books.  I am not good with science fiction or deep intrigue, although I am beginning to enjoy mysteries other than Nancy Drew but I tend to read books that are either historical fiction or more family drama sorts of things.I have never been to \"into\" romance novels once I moved out of the \"Gidget\" stage but I am involved with a Romance Challenge that is allowing me to revisit the genre. I have chosen a couple of Debbie Macomber books for that.  However, I have to add that I did obtain my daughter's name from a Harlequin novel that I was reading at the time so I guess romance novels really don't deserve the discredit they so often get.  I will let you know how it goes.4.  If someone asked you who your favorite authors were right now, which authors would pop out of your mouth?  Are there any you would add on a moment of further reflection?Spontaneously, I would probably mention the ones I have already mentioned above because I am reading some of them now.  However, I would have to add Beverly Lewis, Henry Winterfeld (can't leave out \"Star Girl\"), Larry McMurtry, JD Salinger, Barbara Delinsky, Belva Plain, Rosamunde Pilcher, James Howe (you gotta love \"Bunnicula\"), Kim Edwards. Oh, I don't know, there are so many out there it is really hard to say.I don't know six people to tag so I will probably tag Monique and Mary Kathryn."},

{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, May 29, 2008", "text": "Booking Through Thursday -- What is Reading, FundamentallyIMHO -- reading is feasting your eyes upon the written word and ingesting the meaning therein.  I think all of the examples, except audiobooks, constitute reading. There are many types of reading, for example, reading for pleasure, reading to gain information or instruction, required reading as in a classroom, necessary reading as in street signs but for it to be \"reading\" it has to include the visual action of looking at the written word.I think that \"reading\" changes with different stages in our lives.  As a child, reading comic books for instance is reading as much as reading textbooks.  As an adult, one may read for his/her job or education.  People read novels and literature for pleasure.  It is still all reading and all beneficial.I think that reading is the single most important skill a person can acquire.  If a person can read, he/she can accomplish anything.Did I actually answer the question?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, May 28, 2008", "text": "AmericymruEarlier today I opened my email and found an invitation to join a group called Americymru -- a group primarily for people with Welsh ancestors.  Since my great-grandparents immigrated at the turn of the 20th century from Wales, I decided that I qualify for this group and decided to join.These same great grandparents are the people responsible for my interest in genealogy.  My family always had a strong interest in family history so I grew up with the concept but I was always particularly fascinated with my Welsh family.  I was close to my grandfather but he never talked of his home in Pennsylvania very much -- just snippets -- so, of course, by the time I decided to embark on my search of family, my grandfather was no longer with us to help.  However, I did have some help along the way and I did find out a lot of information but, more importantly, I found family. My great grandparents came from Blaina to Pennsylvania and remained there the rest of their lives.  While they didn't leave much of a paper trail for me to search I did get lucky and find a cousin, Jim Slater.  He has been very helpful over the years by sending me pics and asking his dear little mother, Jean, for information for me -- without him I wouldn't have been as successful.   I also wouldn't have the most wonderful Welsh cookie recipe on the planet -- thanks Jean!On my quest, I made a good friend, Len Clark of Blaina, and found a cousin, Michael Webb, living in Coventry.  Both of these gentlemen have been very helpful and have really given me a link to my \"homeland\".  One day I hope to meet them both.So, I am looking forward to the Americymru group -- who knows, I might even find more cousins!WIP'sSince I have discovered the blogsphere, I find I am reading other people's blogs more than writing my own.  There is a reason for that -- they are much more interesting than I am.  I gravitate toward the blogs on stitchery, quilting, reading and genealogy -- all interests of mine.  I admire all the photos that are up of the work that people do and wish I could be as crafty.So, as a result of having a very boring blog, I have picked up the pace with my quilting and stitchery and reading and genealogy.  I have a couple of WIP's that I can't show right now because they are SURPRISES but I do have a few pitiful pics of past projects that I could put up so here is one of them.I became quite interested in ATC's a while back and bought a lovely little quilted number which I prize.  I decided that I could make my own little mini crazy quilt, too and did and then sold it on Ebay.  However I did keep a picture of it that I am including here.  I only make one of these little things as I prefer to make bigger quilts so this is a one and only!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, May 27, 2008", "text": "Miss Read  Tales from a Village SchoolI just finished the first book in my self-imposed Miss Read challenge.  For my first book I chose HER first book, Tales from a Village School.  This books is not actually short stories nor is it written in chapter form but rather, it is episodic.  Each episode depicts an event or maybe an entire day in the life of Miss Read, a village school teacher.Even though this book is set in the English village of Fairacre in the mid-1950's, it is strongly  reminiscent of my kindergarten year at our neighborhood Methodist church, also in the mid-1950's.  As I read along, I visualized not this village school in a faraway land but rather the large, pink, asbestos shingled barn-like kindergarten building that I attended.  The activities were quite similiar -- like going outside for recess and pretending to be horses, or balls, or pins.  Or, perhaps, getting ready for the Christmas program.  Or maybe the orange juice and dreadful gingersnaps.  At any rate, this book had a very familiar tone to it and a very comfortable feeling.Also, parents reading this books will recognize the antics of ALL children, EVERYWHERE -- boys will be boys and girls will cry.  Yet, it was all handled with the deft nurturing of Miss Read and all was well in the end.Very good book, makes me look forward to the next.Young Readers ChallengeThe Spiderwick Chronicles, Book 1, The Field GuideTony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black2003Simon and Schuster Books for Young ReadersThe Spiderwick Chronicles, Book 1, The Field Guide is about Jared and Simon Grace, identical twins nine years of age, their older sister Mallory, aged thirteen and their mother Helen Grace.In this first book of the series, the Grace family, sans the father who has left the family, moves into a crumbling Victorian house belonging to Mrs. Grace's aged Aunt Lucinda.  The children aren't happy about much of their life since their father departed and having to move to Aunt Lucinda's creepy house isn't helping things at all.  Mallory is into fencing which helps her cope with the life changes she is going through and Simon has an affinity for all things crawly like tadpoles and mice and such.  Jared, however, doesn't seem to have an outlet for his anger and frustration so he has had a few angry episodes of acting out which has landed him in trouble and has really diminished his mother's trust in him. When strange things began happening in the house, Helen was quick to blame Jared.Odd things began from the first day they moved in.  They thought the noises they heard was a squirrel in the wall so they went on a hunt to find the squirrel but they found a very curious nest instead -- not of the squirrel variety.  This discovery led them to explore the house and discovered a note, a riddle, a chest with a false bottom and, most important of all, they discovered that the noise was not a squirrel but rather ... well, I won't spoil it for you.This was a VERY quick read -- I had it done in an hour.  The age group I would suggest it for is about 8 to 12.  While it is a mystery is isn't frightening at all and the illustrations are fantastic. I have to admit that I was drawn to these books because of the covers and the illustrations.  They are gorgeous little books and I am definitely going to add more to my collection.  I would definitely recommend this book."},

Here goes.\"Books and films both tell stories, but what we want from a book can be different from what we want from a movie.  Is this true for you?  If so, what is the difference between a book and a movie?\"Well, yes and no.  Both books and movies are forms of entertainment so, in that regard, yes, I want to be entertained by both.Both books and movies have the capability of being thought provoking, insightful, mood altering, shocking,  and emotional.Movies, however, are instant gratification and require very little \"participation\" from the watcher.  They are relatively quick so there isn't much time to languish in the mood, scenery, language, etc.  They can be very stimulating visually, obviously, and with today's movies that can be very powerful. I do think that movies based on books are generally lacking -- especially if you read the book first.Books, on the other hand, are slower and the reader has the ability to linger over passages, re-read sections and visualize the characters and settings -- make his/her own \"movie\" in the mind, if you will.  With books, the impact unfolds over the course of the read rather than have it \"in your face\" so to speak.So, I would have to say that I want both to entertain me but my mood, available time, and situation would dictate which form would be more appropriate at certain times."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, May 19, 2008", "text": "Shopgirl by Steve MartinOn a random trip to the second hand bookstore across the road, I picked up a copy of Steve Martin's \"Shopgirl\".  I only paid $1 for it but I was, again, drawn to the cover and the size.  It is small -- a novella -- but it powerful.It is about Mirabella Buttersfield, a budding artist who works in the glove department at Neiman's.  Mirabella is a conflicted young woman, quite complex.  She catches the eye of Ray Porter, an \"older\" gentleman of great wealth, also conflicted and complex.They fall into a relationship -- selfless for one and self-serving for the other.  As the story unfolds, the characters grow in their emotions and understanding of those emotions and emerge far different individuals than they began.The book is flawless -- it flows smoothly from one relationship to another, it unpeels Mirabella's conflicts like an onion, and you can actually feel the emotions as they are presented. It is easy to read, very straightforward and draws you in.The book is comedic, also.  How could it not be, given the author.  Even if the reader was unaware that it was penned by Steve Martin, you can \"hear\" him in the narration as he has been heard in many movies.  This book is very much the author.As I read the book, my moods changed to mirror Mirabella's.  At the conclusion of the book I have to say I was tired, emotionally spent.  I would say that as good as this book is, it isn't for anyone who tends toward depression.  It ends well, with a twist, but the process is a struggle in places.  I have to mention that the book is rather graphic, also, so this wouldn't be for a young person.All in all, I enjoyed it even though it was sad, depressing and bittersweet.  It ended well but I have to say that I felt a bit like Anne Sullivan with Helen Keller in the dining room scene, emotionally speaking.I would recommend \"Shopgirl\".  It is short, a quick read, definitely holds one's interest -- just don't read it on a gloomy day!"},

There is no help for me by my self or anybody else, I fear.How-to books -- Well, if cookbooks fit in this catagory then I would have to say yes.  I read cookbooks.  Now, that doesn't mean I actually do anything with the information once I read it but I do read cookbooks.I would have to say that I do read needlework books.

However, I am finding a new resource for that -- my daughter, who is a communication/journalism major, comes in most handy for that sort of thing.

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, April 16, 2008", "text": "The Good Ol' DaysYesterday I was reminded, and not in a good way, how much the world has changed.  What happened yesterday?  Nothing much -- I had to locate a pair of white gloves.  I used to have white gloves but I don't have them anymore -- I guess they were discarded during one of several moves.  We didn't wear them anymore -- why keep them.  After phoning several department stores, craft stores and bridal shops I accepted the fact that they were not to be found locally.  So, I went online.  I found them, placed my online order, paid an unbelievable price for speedy shipping and I was done.  However, my mind raced back in time and I could visualize where I could go to get white gloves -- the accessory department at Joske's where my aunt worked.  Or, Winn's -- the neighborhood five and dime.  But, finding white gloves and handkerchiefs and head scarves wasn't a difficult thing.  When did we quit needing these things?  When life became all jeans and trainers and t-shirts?  Everybody says that is an improvement -- no more hose, heels, the trappings of femininity gone or at least changed.  Not only was it a frustrating quest, finding these white gloves, it was also sad.As I look at the photo above I  am taken back to a much different time but not ALL that long ago.  This photo is of myself (the baby) and my cousin jlshall.  The setting, her house, was typical of the time -- postwar housing, slipcovered furniture, venetian blinds of the metal variety and REAL ivy plants.  My house looked the same way.  Our way of life was different.  Cars weren't as plentiful -- we went downtown on the bus every Saturday (sometimes sporting the much coveted white gloves).  We would eat at Casa Rio, a big treat which never really ended well for either of us.  We shopped at major department stores rather than strip centers.  We didn't have to commute to see our relatives -- if either of us wanted to run away from home all we had to do was cross the street to our aunts houses.  If we needed milk, we walked around the corner to the convenience store that was owned/operated by the same family for all my life.  It was much slower, absolutely primitive compared to today where my daughter has almost a two hour commute to and from her job, where you can't find white gloves and if you want a plain old headscarf you best take yourself to your local antique mall.Are we better off now?  Considering all the media attention directed toward the \"greening\" of ourselves and our environment I would have to say no.  Yes, we live in lovely new homes with new and improved materials,  we have nice cars and many modern conveniences from robotic vacuum cleaners to steam washers and advanced climate control, our wood floors are covered in carpet to keep our feet warm.  Many new, innovative things -- many of which have proven to be grossly unhealthy.However, there are days when I long for the times when our a/c meant open windows and a screen door, our clothes were line dried, our normal transportation was public and we walked to school.  We played outside in our lawn chair house under the gardenia bush and we played with paper dolls cut from coloring books.  Our video games were a deck of cards that we learned to \"fish\" and \"battle\" and get really wild with a game of \"21\".  Our music was on records, scratched that they were, and our television view was limited to two channels -- well, until we got three.We weren't without the normal problems but they seemed to be dealt with more effectively -- nobody committed suicide, turned to drugs or required counseling.  We had each other to help us cope.It was slower then, and some days a little boring, but it was fun when we would all sit outside in the evening and look at the stars as we laid on our backs on blankets.  Yes, we could actually see the stars -- they weren't obscured by city lights.A quick look at the photo reveals more than the home furnishing trends of the time.  It shows two children untouched by stress, healthy in a cleaner environment and secure in the family setting that is still, today, so important.Are the two children in the photo still like that?  Well, sort of.  Older, wiser, survivors of the 60's, but I think we still revere those times and look upon them as the \"gold standard\" of generations -- the best of times, the worst of times so to speak.  I can only speak for myself but I wouldn't mind going back to those times for a day -- if I could get by without the a/c and if I could take my computer and my new white gloves."},

Well, I have been waiting for about two weeks and anytime now would be fine with me.I read a number of blogs that include pictures of their environment.  There are pictures of the Rocky Mountains, pictures of the cherry blossoms in D.C., pictures of the fall leaves in the midwest and northeast. So, I have decided to include a photo of what it has been like in north Texas for the last couple of weeks, off and on.  It isn't much to look at so maybe next time I will post a photo of the Target going up across the street from me.  A lovely view of the loading dock from my backyard, perhaps.  If I didn't hate moving so badly, I would say it was time to go to the country.You, Me and DupreeA and I watch lots of movies, especially since our recent cable tv upgrade has provided us with 20+ movie channels.  Having that many channels doesn't guarantee that there is anything on worth watching nor does it guarantee we are going to agree on what to watch.  Since we have had this abundance of viewing pleasure it has come to my attention that A and I have very different taste in movies.  Usually one of us gives in to the other but last night was an exception -- we both were able to watch something of our choice because the movies were piggy-backed instead of running concurrently.I, being the \"chick\" that I am, chose \"You, Me and Dupree\".  A, being the gentleman that he is, acquiesed politely with a minimum of eye rolling and, after dinner, we settled in for an entertaining evening ahead.Well, long story short, A laughed.  Now, this doesn't happen easily for A.  It isn't that he is a grump, or anything like that, he just doesn't find many things particularly humorous.  But, last night, he laughed.  Out loud.  I laughed, too -- at him laughing.  It was a good evening.I would recommend \"You, Me and Dupree\" for your next movie marathon while waiting for disastrous weather to arrive.  Not because it is a fantastic movie but because it made A laugh.Now, you are probably wondering what A's choice was.  I don't know.  I didn't watch it.  But, I know he didn't laugh."},

It is a collection of short stories all being taken from the author's years as a teacher in village schools in England.  Each story is short so it is a quick read.As JLSHall posted, this isn't a formal challenge --  more of a personal challenge wanting company.  However, if rules are necessary, I can make rules.  Let's see -- who can read the most Miss Read (any or all of the collections, mix and match)  by the end of 2008!  That sounds pretty open ended and flexible.   So, that is it.

{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, April 08, 2008", "text": "Jeremy -- The Tale of an Honest BunnyI chose \"Jeremy--The Tale of an Honest Bunny\" by Jan Karon as my ninth book in the Young Readers Challenge.This book is a lovely book.  The dust jacket is vintage looking with a window to the hard-cover.  The hard-cover is a very nice on it's own.  The book even has a sewn in bookmark.  The illustrations, by Teri Weidner, are exquisite -- reminiscent of illustrations in books of the late 40's and early 50'.  It reminds me of the books that I used to get from Joske's Department Store and Ann and Tom Brown's Toy Store.The story is sweet, albeit predictable.  Jeremy is a cloth bunny created In England for a recipient in America.  He is alive and talks, a lot like Pinocchio.  He doesn't want to be shipped in a box and prefers to \"deliver himself\" to Candace, his new person in his new home.  Expectantly, Jeremy has many adventures and difficulties on his road to America.  He resolves his difficulties by being \"an honest\" bunny which is what he promised Lydia, his creator.  The object lesson is honesty and staying focused on the goal.I would recommend this as a read-to-me book for 5-6 yr. olds.  It is conveniently divided into short chapters that work well as a bedtime story to be continued the next night -- about a week's worth.  An eight year old would enjoy reading alone.  I think this one would top out at about 9 yrs.It is a good book.  A lovely addition to a child's library and a classic that can grow up with a child for a while."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, April 07, 2008", "text": "For the Love of Cross StitchWhen I was about five, or so, my mother decided to introduce me to embroidery.  It was a set of pre-stamped tea towels.  If my memory serves me correctly, the pattern was of kittens.  My stitches were too big and some of them were pulled but I was fascinated.  That was my first venture with a great span of time until my next attempt as an adult.  I did a few crewel kits as a young married woman.  They turned out pretty well but I was not the least bit prepared for the fact that moths could actually eat my best attempt -- as it hung on the wall!  I was devastated.  So, in an attempt to find something that wasn't food for something else, I turned my attention to cross stitch.I love cross stitch and have done a lot of it over the years.  But, I struggle.  I absolutely love the look of linen but have difficulty counting out the stitches over two threads -- especially if the stitches are far apart.  Evenweave creates the same problem.  I tend to stay with aida which is quite limiting in the look that I want to create.  Sometimes frustration abounds but still I persevere.I love the cottages, bungalows, lighthouses -- any houses-- depicted in the cross stitch mags.  I have a weakness for small houses.  I collect small houses such as David Winter cottages -- I even picture the families in the small houses.  So, it is no surprise that I like to stitch them.The picture posted here is of a WIP that has been recently -- very recently -- completed.  It was a WIP for so long I almost never got the masking tape off so I could press it.  I swear never to put masking tape on my work again -- I really do.  It takes longer to wrap the edges in the tape than it does to put a zigzag around it with the sewing machine.  In any event, here is my latest  completion.I have started a new project -- a pair of absolutely gorgeous birds.  The thread variation is so intricate I am having to work on it one ten stitch grid at a time.  Oh, thank goodness for sticky notes!  I will post more when I have more done -- right now it is VERY hard to tell it is a bird.At any rate, here is my little house!Miss Read ChallengeI have an affinity for buying books, similar to my affinity for buying needlework/quilting paraphenalia and Poirot mystery DVD's.  All of these things are lovely, in their own way, but need to be dealt with eventually because I am sure they have the ability to multiply themselves in the dark.  So, here in the early days of 2008, I have been making time to participate in each of these activities -- at least a bit each day.The Young Readers Challenge has been quite helpful in making me look at my collection of children's books that I have either never read or wish to read again.  Unfortunately, it sent me to the bookstore to look for more which my one bulging bookcase can't handle.As I looked at the bulging bookcase, the books resting there two deep, I became very aware of my reading \"style\".  I tend to like books that are either historical fiction or that represent a cozy, homey sort of life that is found in a time or place that is different from that in which I live.  The one notable thing about my selection of books is that they are mostly in series.  Since I just finished the latest book by Jan Karon, \"Home from Holly Springs\", I was looking for something to follow it up with (while waiting for the next Karon) so I went to Karon's website and she suggested a couple of Miss Read books of the Thrush Green series.  I went to my bulging bookcase -- noted as the BBC from here on -- and I found that I had a copy of the first Miss Read work from 1955.  The title is \"Tales of a Village School\".  Upon further review, I learned that there are two sizable Miss Read series -- the Fairacre series and the Thrush Green series.  The book I have is the first of the Fairace series and that is where I will begin. (Note: www.fantasticfiction.co.uk has a listing of all the Miss Read books by series)So, I have decided to begin my own reading challenge.  I am going to challenge myself to begin the Miss Read books and see how far I go.  If anyone would care to join me just let me know.  There are no rules -- rules aren't fun -- just choose a book and have a go.\"Miss Read has created an orderly universe in which people are kind and conscientious and cherish virtues and manners now considered antiquated elsewhere...An occasional visit to Fairace offers a restful change from the frenetic pace of the contemporary world.\" ---Publishers WeeklySee, I told you I liked books from a different time and place than the one in which I live.Happy Reading!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, April 05, 2008", "text": "Home to Holly SpringsI have read the entire Mitford series by Jan Karon and enjoyed each book thoroughly.  I have read many reviews that used words like predictable, sappy, etc.  Are they predictable?  Yes, but not always.  Are they sappy?  I didn't find them so but I guess in some peoples opinion they could be.  Light?  Yes.  Preachy? In my opinion, no.   To me, they are a welcome relief from a big city world where just turning on the morning news can incite fear for our very being.  Mitford is a lovely place to escape to.So, when I began \"Home to Holly Springs\" I expected more of the affable Fr. Tim and his host of Mitford characters.  I was quite surprised to find a rather deep depiction of Tim Kavanaugh's childhood fraught with violence, deception, racial situations and fear.  Karon does, IMHO, an outstanding job of presenting these concepts to her readers without Fr. Tim losing his \"identity\".  She also recreates these events in Fr. Tim's life graphically enough to her get point across but not so much as to lose her tone and HER identity.In the original Mitford series, religious faith is obviously the main storyline but takes a backseat to the characters and life in the small North Carolina town.  Faith is underlying and referred to but it is still light reading.  In the Holly Springs books, faith is viewed as deep, long time coming, sometimes difficult to understand and maintain but, in the end, something we all need to get us through the difficulties of life.  I found the emphasis on religion between the two series to be completely different -- much more significant in Holly Springs.Being of a religious mind myself, I was drawn to the original books because of their wholesomeness.  They possess comedic situations, are upbeat, have likeable characters and picturesque settings.  They show the  vulnerability of the human spirit and aren't afraid to confess God in our everyday life.  Holly Springs, however, is different.  It, too, has great characterization, comedic episodes, and picturesque settings.  However, the faith shown in this book is deeper, more urgent, the situations much more serious-- life threatening and life affirming.  I found the original series to be faith building but not anything like Holly Springs.\"Home to Holly Springs\" is a wonderful book.  In my opinion is flows flawlessly, the characters are well developed and it draws you in from the first page.  While I succumbed to the faith building aspect of the work, it could be read and enjoyed by anyone of any belief.  It isn't preachy -- it just teaches by example, shows how people are really flawed and faith gets them through the tough things that life throws at us.Predictable? To some extent. Sappy?  Sure. Enjoyable? Absolutely.  Recommended?  Without a doubt!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, April 03, 2008", "text": "Booking Through ThursdayWhen somebody mentions \"literature\", what is the first thing you think of? (Dickens? Tolstoy? Shakespeare?)Do you read \"literature\" (however you define it) for pleasure? Or is it something you read only when you must?When you say \"literature\" I immediately think of my senior English class in high school.  Somehow the word \"literature\" and Beowulf seem to go together to me.  But, on further review, I guess I look at most fiction as literature.  I mean, after all, isn't some of the more contemporary fiction going to be upheld as great literature somewhere down the road? For the most part, I read for pleasure.  I read to escape to another place and put myself in the shoes of another for a while.  I choose to read, it isn't something that is forced on me anymore -- i.e. I am not in that sr. English class anymore.  I find, though, that I am wanting to go back and read, for pleasure, some of the things I read then because I HAD to.On the other hand, I do read a great deal for information.  As a quilter and a needleworker I read to learn more about those activities.  Still, it is for pleasure. As a child, I wanted desperately to learn to read -- the newspaper fascinated me.  Somehow I knew it would always serve me well and I was right -- just give me a book and I am a happy camper."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, April 02, 2008", "text": "Wait Until Helen ComesWritten by Mary Downing Hahn, this is the eighth book I have read for the Young Readers Challenge.  It was published in 1987 by Avon books.When I began this book, I didn't like it.  The parents, newlyweds, were too self-serving and self-absorbed.  When they married they created a blended family, Jean, Michael and Molly,her two children from a previous marriage and Heather, the moody, troubled seven year old daughter of Dave and his deceased wife. Basically, it is a story about the trials of a blended family and an unwelcomed move to a new home.  The subplot is, of course, a ghost story involving Heather and the ghost of a young girl named Helen.  Their stories paralleled each other exactly.  As the story unfolds, Michael remains pretty much unchanged, Molly is forced to face her fear of her mortality and Heather is able to face her guilt in regards to her mother's death.  It all ends well, of course, but I have real problems with the whole thing.In the first place, Heather was three years old when her mother died in a fire that was started by the toddler.  I really think that the guilt is not realistic -- a three year old is not going to remember in detail the events leading up to her mothers death and blame herself.  Heather's possession by Helen (the ghost) if you want to call it that, is just disturbing. The parents, Jean and Dave, are completely self-absorbed and don't seem to be too concerned about their kids until the end of the book.  They don't listen. The arguments between Jean and Dave concerning the children are very realistic and, in my opinion, not very entertaining.Michael is the only well adjusted one, it seems. Not much to say about him -- the character isn't very well developed and you only get his insight once throughout the whole book.Molly seems to be having issues with her own mortality.  I picture Molly to be about twelve, although I don't believe it was ever stated, and I just don't think a twelve year old would dwell on the finality of her death.  Most twelve year olds I have known think they are invincible!All in all, the book was very well written and flowed well.  It drew me in and held my interest but I just think it was entirely too graphic, morbid and depressing for anyone under the age of twelve and I am not too sure about a twelve year old -- I guess it would depend on the child.I would recommend that parents read this book before recommending it to their children."},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, April 01, 2008", "text": "Rollie All Grown UpI have decided to add a photo of G. Rollie now that he is all grown up.  Grown up, indeed, at the ripe old age of 18 months old, he is on a diet.  When  he came to us at 5 months old he was a robust kitten.  Well, he is now a robust adult and tipped the scales at 17 pounds at his last vet visit.  The vet wasn't happy and now Rollie is on diet food and precious little of it.  I think he has lost an ounce.At any rate, the photo is of Rollie enjoying one of his many pasttimes -- helping me with my quilting.  He also likes to play with knitting needles and a bobbin of embroidery thread isn't safe anywhere near him.  Trying to accomplish anything crafty with Rollie in the vacinity is almost impossible yet, he is so funny, I can't get angry or shoo him away.So, here he is, showing his patriotism by wrapping himself up in the flag quilt I am making for my daughter's classroom.  No surprise that it has taken me about 500% longer to applique those 50 stars than it would have without all the help I was getting.But, at the end of the day, I am going to have to give him credit on the quilt label because he was obviously an active participant.Gig em', Rollie!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, March 27, 2008", "text": "Booking Through ThursdayWhile acknowledging that we can't judge books by their covers, how much does the design of a book affect your reading enjoyment?  Hardover vs softcover? Trade paperback vs mass market paperback?  Font? Illustrations? Etc.?Ok, I will admit, I am a sucker for a neat looking book. I am attracted to the gorgeous cover art of the likes of  Wendell Minor (\"Then Came Heaven\" by LaVyrle Spencer and William Ireland (\"Evening Class\" by Maeve Binchy).  It was the cover art that drew my eye to the Jan Karon \"Mitford\" books which, of course, turned out to be absolutely lovely books.I don't care for books with artwork from movies.  In fact, I don't really like reading a book if I have seen the movie.  Bad memories of an oral book report on \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" circa 1964.  I have a copy of \"Chocolat\" that has a photo of Juliette Binoche on the cover.  I have to say that, as much I like Ms. Binoche as an actress, I don't like the cover of this book. Hard back vs paper back?  Well, I really prefer hard backs if they aren't too thick.  They just hold up better because I tend to carry a book with me every place I go and they are more propable.  If they are too large, however, they are difficult to hold with my weak wrists.  I do buy many paperbacks, however, and have to admit that they are more \"purse-able\". I think it just depends on how the mood strikes me and whether the book will become a permanent part of our little library or perhaps passed around to friends.The typeface is another matter, however.  It needs to be dark and easy to read.  While I am not quite to the point of buying \"large print\" books, I can see it out on the horizon.  Another negative about the \"Chocolat\" book -- small print on the greyish side. All of this has to do with the initial attraction to the book, however.  Once I have read the dust jacket or an excerpt from the book (mostly done while standing in the store juggling all the magazines I tend to buy), I know whether I am going to enjoy the book in spite of the cover art.  I have reshelved many \"cool looking\" books because they just weren't for me.  Unfortunately, I have probably never taken a second look at some great books because the packaging just didn't grab me.I read/collect children's books and I am drawn to the illustrations -- who isn't.  Again, however, if the story falls flat, I won't purchase the book just for the art -- it has to be a complete package.  Like jlshall, I wish adult books could be illustrated -- they should be illustrated.  I like the street maps in the Mitford books -- they create a visual for the reader that really puts you into the book.At the end of the day, however, it is the content that matters and once I am \"into\" a book, the cover matters not a whit.  All the decoration in the world won't \"make\" a book nor will lack of decoration doom it.Great covers do make book shopping fun though and I am sure turn a good profit for the dealers.Number the Stars by Lois LowryMy seventh book for the Young Reader's Challenge is \"Number the Stars\" by Lois Lowry. It is a Newberry Award Winner published in 1989 by Yearling, a division of Random House.\"Number the Stars\" is the story of 10 year old Annemarie Johansen who lived in Denmark in 1943 after Denmark had surrendered to the Nazis.  She lives with her parents and her younger sister, Kirsti in an apartment in Copenhagen.  Her best friend is Ellen Rosen who lives upstairs.  They are fast friends and would do anything for one another -- and do.This book is different from \"Letters from Rifka\" in that it shows more fear, more danger and more heroism.   In the beginning, Annemarie sufferes deprivation to a point -- childish things like pink cupcakes -- but she is fortunate that her family is intact, except for an older sister, Lise who died in a vague \"accident\".  She and her friend, Ellen, go to school and life continues pretty much as usual until one day -- the Jewish New Year -- when things change.  Ellen's parents leave for a while to an undisclosed location, Annemarie, her mother, her sister, and Ellen make a hasty trip to visit her Uncle Henrik in the country.  Annemarie could sense the tension and danger and was becoming very aware that the world they new was changing quickly and not for the better. When they arrived at Uncle Henrik's, Annemarie realized that there was a serious movement going on and that her family was part of it.  Her family was involved in the hiding and transporting of Danish Jews across the ocean to Sweden.  Ellen was reunited with her family and then embarked on a quick but very dangerous journey in the false bottom of Uncle Henrik's fishing boat.Annemarie's family realized that she was being very brave and so they gave her bits and pieces of information.  She was growing up quickly and had many questions.  She learned that her sister, Lise, was part of the resistance movement along with her fiance, Peter, and was killed while fleeing from a meeting.  Annemarie learned that her Uncle Henrik had been helping people flee for a while and he told her of the tactics he had for not getting caught.The last chapter of the book has the Johansens together two years later.  The war was over and life was returning to normal.  Annemarie hadn't forgotten her friend and was looking forward to being reunited with her at some point in the future.The afterword is quite interesting because it explains the book -- what is fiction, what is not, what is documented historical military fact.This book is well written, flows flawlessly, is edgy and tense without being unbearably sad or grotesquely graphic.  You know, without a doubt, that the Rosens are safe and will return home at some point and you can feel the relief of the end of the turmoil.I would recommend this book for the older reader in our age group.  It is very readable, the content is not objectionable, you can feel Annemarie maturing and her parents realizing that they can trust her with precious information.   I might even read it again, myself."},

Still not done, still enjoying it, don't know what I would cut out but it is really, really lengthy and I am, apparently, really, really slow.Would recommend, though.\"An American Haunting\"Our cable tv service and our internet service is bundled through our cable tv service.  It can get pricey so, a few weeks ago we got a call from the cable company with a promotional.  I just assumed that A wouldn't be interested so I brushed them off.  Well, much to my surprise, he WAS interested so I called them back, apologized and listened to their their pitch.  They were going to lower our bill and include one movie tier.  A was shaking his head \"no\" -- he doesn't believe in subscribing to premium movie channels.  I was hesitant, the salesman on the other end of the phone was trying hard so he just threw in everything they had to offer for the same low price which wasn't low but it was quite a bit lower than what we were paying without any premium channels. I made the administrative decision to go for it.That doesn't mean there is anything on to watch. A doesn't like light comedy, it seems.  So, we have been catching a lot of action movies, thrillers, documentaries.The latest thriller was \"An American Haunting\".  A movie in the same vein as \"The Others\".  I really liked \"The Others\".  I would say it was more startling than scary.  \"An American Haunting\" however was just downright scary to me.  Startling, also, but scary.  I don't know if it had to do with the late hour we were watching it or what but it was scary.If you are looking for a scary, ghostly movie for your next movie marathon -- try this one.  It won't disappoint."},

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, March 07, 2008", "text": "\"Bunnicula\" by James HoweThe sixth book that I have read for the Young Readers Challenge is \"Bunnicula\" by Deborah and James Howe.For those of you who enjoy reading aloud to your children, I would recommend this book, as well as the sequels.  The age group that it would be appropriate for would be 8-12, the elder of that group reading it on their own, obviously.This is the most hysterical book I have ever read to my own children.  While it is a children's book, the humor will appeal to adults and will send you into fits of laughter -- and the kids will look at you like you are crazy.  Just remember to read the forward -- it will set the tone for the entire adventure.The book is about the Monroe family, Mom, Dad the two boys and Chester the cat and Harold the dog.  It is presented from the viewpoint of Harold.  The family is very educated, sophisticated and so are the pets.\"At this point, I feel I must explain something.  In our family, everyone treats everyone else with great respect for his or her intelligence.  That goes for the animals as well as the people.  Everything that happens to them is explained to us.  It's never been just \"Good boy, Harold,\" or \"use the litter box, Chester at our house.  Oh no, with us it's \"Hey Harold, Dad got a raise and now we're in a higher tax bracket,\" or \"come sit on the bed, Chester, and watch this Wild Kingdom show.  Maybe you will see a relative.\"So, you can see that Chester and Harold had quite a bit of adjusting to do when the Monroes brought home a new family member -- Bunnicula -- a bunny.  Now, Bunnicula has some peculiar behaviors and Chester decides that he is going to get to the bottom of it.  He has a theory and decides to test his theory which only gets him in deep trouble.  Harold is torn between his loyalty to his old friend and his empathy for his new friend.This isn't your usual, run of the mill dog and cat story. It is intelligent, hysterical, poignant and isn't the least bit difficult for an adult to get into while reading to the kids.I would definitely recommend this book and I enjoyed reading it again, myself."},

And Why\"I would have to say that my favorite lead male character is Father Tim, the main character in the Jan Karon Mitford series.  Why?  Well, he is so REAL.  Even though he is an Episcopal priest, he has all the strengths, weaknesses, temptations, doubts as us regular folks.  He isn't preachy and really shows the human side of life. He is kind and gentle, he has diabetes and loves food which shows his vulnerability.  All in all, he is just a real down to earth character -- picture an aging Dan Aykroyd.The second favorite would be Blackie in the Barbara Taylor Bradford \"A Woman of Substance\" series.  He is another gentle, loyal soul that isn't afraid to show the frailities and strengths of the human spirit.

I usually read longer books either in the form of historical fiction or serial works.  I picked this one up on the bargain counter at B&N -- can't resist the bargain counter. It takes place in 1952 during the Korean War.  It is set in Manhattan -- an Irish neighborhood that is neither properous nor colorful.  It is Christmas and the main character, Peter, a seventeen year old sailor home on leave is facing a very dismal holiday.  His girlfriend has written him a \"dear John\" letter which he intends to talk to her about; his father is sullen and introspective, nothing new there; his mother is struggling with  too many children and not enough money; and he is facing being shipped off to Korea.  All of this is punctuated by the fact that Peter feels that he doesn't know his father at all and he isn't sure if his father really loves him.The whole book takes place over just a few days but it is a few days filled with loss, discovery, \"coming of age\" and a gift.  You will have to read the book to see what the gift is because I won't tell.I would recommend this book."},

It would have been lousy as a kid to only have a birthday every four years.  However, at this point in my life, I can see where it might be really nice! But, it wasn't to be. However, I do have this extra day.  An extra day and a Friday to boot.  I have decided what I am going to do with this extra day -- apart from the impossibly long \"to do\" list I have already made this morning.  I am going to learn how to take the pictures off the camera, put them into the computer and then put them onto my blog. I read a number of blogs and they all have such lovely pictures of their needlework, their vacation spots, their crafts, themselves (that means you jlshall) and my blog is severely lacking.Accomplishing this will require a lot -- paper and pencil to write down the process because I will NEVER remember it (I am completely unteachable in these matters) and A.  A has to be here to walk me through it.  I have 360 pictures on my camera that need to be stored and saved.  I think this would be a good day to do that.After all, we have an extra day -- a day to do something different.Yes."},

Morning is like late winter, afternoon is like early spring.  I guess that sounds typical.  It is sunny but windy -- and the cedar pollen is high -- again.  I awoke with the remnants of the allergy attack of yesterday -- not gone but going.  The cat is a bit punk and the laundry is multiplying itself in the dark.  It is pretty much business as usual except that A gave me the gift that I had picked out a few weeks ago.  It is much easier for him if I do the picking, he does the buying and hiding and presenting.  It works well that way because sometimes I even forget what it is I chose!  I guess those senior moments can work to our advantage if we look at it that way.  So, all in all, it is a good day.  The best gift is that I have today -- sneezing, itching, punky cat, cedar and all.  I will take it.  It is a good thing!"},

The author is Emily Brightwell, the publisher is The Berkley Publishing Group.I am not a lover of the mystery.  However, and I am not proud to admit this, I purchased this book because I was attracted to the dust jacket.  The art work drew me in.  Ok, I know that you can't judge a book by it's cover.However, in this case, the cover was a fair judge of the book.  It was a quick, easy read.  It isn't very long and the hardback version is a small size which makes holding it easy for arthritic hands and wrists.  The story  got me from the beginning.  While some of it was obvious, the ending wasn't -- I was surprised and it was very clever.  The characters are pretty well developed, they were likeable (the ones that were supposed to be) and the ones that weren't supposed to be -- well, they weren't.  I didn't expect all this out of a book that was really simply written and straightforward.  No sophistication here but a good story, good characters and a novel ending.I would recommend."},

It received the National Jewish Book Award and was published in the US in 1991 by Henry Holt and Company, Inc.It is a true story of the author's family's immigration to the US from Russia during World War I.  Even though there were some changes by the author it is the story of her Aunt Lucy.The story details the family's life in Russia, their dangerous flee from their home and the perils along the way that separated the main character, Rifka, from her family for over a year.  While that sounds quite dire for a twelve year old, she did have some good adventures and new experiences along the way -- like learning about bananas.The story showed amazing maturity and insight for a 12 year old girl, a good example for girls that age who would be reading this book.  It also showed how children in other places don't necessarily have the same things that we have -- like bananas.  It gives the reader a glimpse into the life of people from other countries and in another time.  In spite of the dire circumstances of the times, the book was not depressing.  Even though it dealt with death, loss, and change, the main character is positive and tries to make the best of her situation.I would recommend this for a reader at the upper end of the age range of our challenge.  It does take a bit of maturity to read it and I think a younger reader simply wouldn't have an interest in it.  This could coincide nicely as a supplement for a history class."},

I really like pics with the blogs, if appropriate, so I have to figure this out.  Bear with me -- it might take a while because my technical brain cell is rather small.From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. FrankweilerThe fourth book I have read for the Young Reader's Challenge is \"From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler\" by E. L. Konigsburg (1967).I chose this book because it was my daughter's favorite book when she was growing up.  I also chose this book because it was recommended by JLSHall.  I have to say that both women have excellent taste in children's books.This book is a charming account of two very brave and resourceful siblings who decide to run away.  Well, Claudia, the main character and older sibling, decided to run away and Jamie, the younger, was chosen to go because of his vast financial ability -- and his $24.43.Claudia planned her runaway down to the most minute detail -- her running away was to be DIFFERENT.    \"\"Claudia knew that she should could never pull off the old fashioned kind of running away...\"  so she decided to run not from some where but to somewhere -- somewhere large, warm, comfortable, and beautiful.  And that was how Claudia and her brother, Jamie, ended up living in the Metropolitan Museum of Art--and right in the middle of a mystery that made headlines.\"The book is clever, the children are funny, there is something in it for everybody -- a little art, a little history, a little mystery.  It is easy to read but not simplistic.  I enjoyed it and hated to see it end.I would recommend this for 8-12 year olds with the warning \"don't try this at home\"."},

Oh well, that seems to be my comfort zone -- or rut -- whatever.  Two years ago my DD asked me to make her a lap quilt in the form of an American flag for her classroom.  I pieced together a lovely flag with the correct proportions and everything.  Everything but fifty perfectly placed, appliqued stars. When I showed DD the pieced top, expecting squeals of delight, I was met with a dejected, disappointed look -- where were the fifty stars?  Well, I cut out the stars, fused them on and I am STILL appliqueing the stupid things on the blue field which wasn't a solid blue field but rather a blue field with, yes, stars.Ok, so being the sort of person I am -- I am sure there is a name for it -- I really hate starting a new project before I finish an existing one.  I am not saying I haven't -- I have made about four or five other quilts while sticking these stars down -- but I don't LIKE to do it.  So, during this whole process, I seem to have lost my \"edge\".  I go to the fabric store but I just don't have the drive to buy the fabric -- even for my stash.  The fifty stars seem to have sucked the very life out of my creativity.  It is very sad.In an effort to get past the \"block\" I am experiencing and to do something completely spontaneous, I dragged A to the Bear Creek Quilt Guild show this past weekend.  The weather was lovely.  The show wasn't so gigantic that you couldn't find your way around the hall because of the crowds.  The theme was exciting -- \"Four Score and Seven Quilts Ago\" -- showcasing Civil War reproduction quilts. Altogether there were some 400 quilts on display.  Large quilts, small art quilts, old quilts -- all very exciting.  I could just feel the urge to sew wash over me.  It was a great show, a wonderful way to spend an early morning.  We were done by lunch, even browsing the vendor booths.  And, I managed to bring home a very special pincushion with much personality -- Miss Buttons.  I even think A enjoyed looking at the Civil War \"stuff\" so it was a good time for both of us. Well, I guess I should get back to those insufferable stars."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, January 25, 2008", "text": "For my third review for the Young Readers Challenge, I have chosen three books to be reviewed as one.  I refer to them as the Gossie Trilogy when, in fact, the titles are \"Gossie\", \"Gossie and Gertie\",  and \"Ollie\".  These are board books by Olivier Dunrea.Gossie is a gosling.  In the first book she is alone in her world with her boots, discovering all that is there to be discovered.  The books takes the young reader or listener through Gossie's day and show how important her boots are to her.  Then, the unthinkable happens -- she loses her prized boots only to discover them in somebody else's possession.  Enter Gertie.  This books parallels a toddler, or pre-K child's life with Gossie. It would be familiar to a child to see Gossie in her routine, not unlike the child's routine and to see Gossie have to deal with new interruptions to her life such as losing a cherised item and making a new friend.  This books makes excellent use of concepts such as over, under, in, backward, forward, etc and provides familiarity in things like snow and rain.  The sentence structure is very simple but provides a good vocabulary.The second book, \"Gossie and Gertie\" introduces the two little goslings as best friends.  They do everything alike and together, like wearing boots.  Like the first book, spatial concepts are expanded, concrete situations are presented such as playing in the hay or swimming in the pond but intangible concepts are being introduced as well such as friendship, best friendship. The sentences in this book are longer and conversation is introduced.The third book is Ollie.  By this book, Gossie and Gertie are fast friends and exploring their surroundings in great deal in farther reaching area.  They discover Ollie, who is an egg.  They are intrigued.  They are patient but Ollie doesn't want to come out.  The concept of fear is introduced because Ollie is afraid to come out.  He rolls away, he tries to hide, Gossie and Gertie try to make him come out and peck at him with their beaks but he won't come out.  A bit of reversed psychology is in order, it seems, so G & G decide to tell him not to come out so the concept of reason is introduced.   Suddenly Ollie realizes that he is alone and he waits -- then he decides to come out.I bought \"Gossie\" to read to my infant grandson.  However, the illustrations are so pleasing and the books so charming that I had to get the other two.  The characters are shown in a natural growing progression with enough challenge to require problem solving but not harsh enough to result in any trauma.  They are gentle books that children could identify with, they teach some life lesson as well as vocabulary and concepts.Does my grandson like the books?  I don't know but he likes to chew on them which is another reason I bought them being board books and all.  I like them though and we read them every time he comes over.I definitely recommend."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, January 16, 2008", "text": "The Alamo Cat by Rita KerrI just finished my second book for the Young Readers Challenge.  The book entitled \"The Alamo Cat\" was written by Rita Kerr, a San Antonio retired teacher who chose writing as a second career.  The book is only about fifty pages and I would say that an eight year old could read it.My initial impression of the book was that I wasn't going to like it.  There was too much going on, too much history, too much description, just too much.  Yet, there were some areas that I thought just screamed for more explanation.  Being a native San Antonian myself, I knew the history and the references but I could see that a child could use more explanation in some areas.  However, I think there were some areas that were too descriptive when it wasn't necessary.With that said, as I read the book, I began to enjoy it. As the book progressed, the verbage seemed to calm down and flowed better.  Of course, all of that seemed to fade into the background when you got to know \"Ruby\", the Alamo cat.  For those of us who have cats, it is immediate recognition and connection.  For those of us who call San Antonio our home there is definitely a bond. For those who would like a little glimpse into the workings of the Alamo, this gives a bit of information.If you would like to obtain this book for your child, however, I will give you fair warning.  It doesn't end happily.  It is, though, a historical account and many of those don't end happily either but be aware, if you have sensitive children, you should read the book first. Without doubt, Ruby was, indeed, a latter-day hero of the Alamo whose name should go down into  history with Crockett, Bowie, and Travis.  It was a very touching book."},

{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, January 10, 2008", "text": "\"The Amber Cat\" by Hilary McKayI have just finished my first book for the Young Readers Challenge.  I chose \"The Amber Cat\" by Hilary McKay.  My copy was obtained from a public library sale and still had the dust jacket which stated that the age group it was suitable for was 9 -12.  I would have to say that I think it would be better enjoyed by the older of that group.The book takes place in contemporary England and is a story within a story.  The primary story is that of a women raising her son alone after the death of her husband.  She and the son live in a large semi-detached house, the other half which is occupied by her husbands best friend and his family.  The primary story is complete on its own.  The secondary story takes the form of flashbacks but not just momentary flashbacks for the sake of clarification or plot progression, but rather a complete story on its own. Both stories contain elements of mystery, ghosts, human fraility and understanding.  Both stories are good works alone but the way the author blends them is very good.  It would hold a child's interest, I think, but the child would have to read carefully in order to grasp the nuances throughout the book, therefore, I think it would be more suitable for an older reader.My favorite character was Sun Dance -- he seemed to be an old soul.  I could envision Kevin Corcoran (Moochi of Walt Disney fame) playing this role.I won't give away the plot.  It is simple and obvious to an adult but the way the web was woven was still charming and interesting."},

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, January 04, 2008", "text": "My Son --My son just had his 32nd birthday.  Yes, 32nd.  It is hard to believe that the tiny bundle that blessed our home in December, 1975 is 32 years old.  Surely it was just yesterday that I looked into those turquoise blue eyes, tossled that carrot top hair, and counted those impossibly tiny fingers and toes.It seems like just yesterday that I was wondering what he would be like at eight years old.  For some reason, 8 yrs. old was a benchmark for me -- not a baby and not a teen, but a boy with so much potential.  Did he live up to my vision? Yes, he did.  He was all boy, rough and tumble, with a bit of a temper but with a vulnerability that he was very slow to share.  He wanted to be just like his dad, he didn't \"need\" Mom, he worshipped his grandfather and he loved his sister but the only way he would show it was by \"saving her life\" when she did something dangerous.Year eight went by very quickly.Before we knew it, we were having senior photos taken and signing up for dorms.  He was going away.  I knew he needed to but I sobbed when we left him at school although I waited until we were out of sight.  We heard from him VERY often his first semester at college -- need for laundry, need for groceries, need to come home.  Then the inevitable happened -- the calls became less and less frequent.  We knew he was ok because nobody had called to tell us differently.  Only one thing could have happened.  Yes, a girl.The college years went by quickly with a few glitches along the way.  There were the predictible moves from the dorm to the apartments to the houses and back to the apartments.  There were the on-campus jobs that jangled my nerves knowing that he was working late hours and walking late at night on his own.  There was the car accident that could have been so tragic and the major injury while ice skating.  He survived them all and learned a lot. So did I.What did I learn?  I learned faith, trust, patience and to be forever thankful for the blessing that was given to me in the form of this little red-headed kid.My son knows I am proud of him, for all his accomplishments and there are many, for the man he has become.  But what he doesn't know is how much I admire him for the obstacles that were put before him and how he rose above them.  What he doesn't know is how I wish I had his strength and perserverance and drive.  What he doesn't know is that I thank God every day for giving me the privilege of being this boy's mother because I am sure he has taught me more than I ever taught him.He is 32 now and has a boy of his own.  Another blessing in the form of a little blue eyed, tow-headed Nathan.  I look at Nathan and am transported back to 1975 and wonder ...what will he be like at eight.Happy birthday, son, I love you."},

Most people don't look at this time as being a time of reflection, that would be reserved for New Year's Eve.  I, however, find it a very appropriate time to look back over the previous year and see what worked, what didn't, what can be changed, what will simply be tolerated.  I don't believe in resolutions -- they always fail but I do believe in realistic observation and appropriate action.My children are grown.  Gone are the days of Barbie, leggos, action figures -- except for the sixteen boxes of aforementioned items from the 70's currently housed in my attic.  Gone are the days of surprises because now my children have preferences and opinions and homes and spouses.  They have changed.  Their needs, desires and expectations have changed.  Mine, on the other hand, have not.  I still find myself shopping for the \"perfect\" gift, a surprise, if possible.  I still find myself looking for the perfect wrapping to create the fantasy Christmas that my children enjoyed in their youth.This year, however, in the quest for all the Christmas perfection I seem to need, something became alarmingly apparent to me--the cost of the wrapping paper.  I didn't do as much shopping as I ususally do.  Much of my shopping was done online in a search for hard-to-find religious publications for my son or vintage college yearbooks for my daughter.  So, I assumed that since I didn't buy as much I wouldn't need as much thrilling wrapping and decoration.  My third trip to my neighborhood Hallmark store had me wondering what in the world I HAD bought and why was it taking so much paper to wrap it?  Did I buy more than I thought? Was there less paper on the roll?  Was I getting senile and did I forget that I ALWAYS buy nine rolls of paper every year.Nine rolls of paper and the appropriate ribbon and tags totalling about $110.  Paper that was ripped and thrown away, paper that was not even admired for its beauty and cleverness.  Nobody commented on the giant white polka dots that the rocking horse was wrapped in.  In my opinion, that $110  could have been flushed down the toilet.Next year the perfect gift, the perfect color, size and wrapped in the perfect wrapping -- money."},

{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, September 13, 2007", "text": "My father was a free spirit.  My mother was too, in her younger days, I have been told.  I had a wonderful, albeit unconventional childhood.  My mother, however, lost her free spirit when I was born.  Perhaps she knew I would be her only child or perhaps the reality of the responsibility of nurturing another individual was overwhelming.  Perhaps it was the polio outbreak that brought out a new dimension of my mother's personality.  Whatever the cause, my mother's fun loving personality was now replaced with worry -- worry over germs, freak accidents and bad behavior (mine, not hers). Her worry over germs didn't keep me from contracting everything contagious  that childhood had to offer.  Her worry over freak accidents made me try so hard to be careful and not get hurt that I was the clumsiest child in San Antonio.  Her expectations of my behavior needn't have been a concern at all because my mother had a magic weapon -- guilt.  Now, I was a very compassionate child that wouldn't have hurt another person knowingly for any reason.  That included my mother, yet her best parenting advice for anybody was \"make her ashamed of herself\" for whatever offense was commited whether it was stealing the tiny little padlock from Handy Andy when I was three or not wanting to dance with Charlotte at the dancing school Christmas party.  I grew up thinking the worse thing I could do in life was be or do something shameful in my mother's eyes.  I still carry the guilt of all the things I could have done, should have done, shouldn't have done -- whatever.  As as result, I am a sad person.  Things have always made me sad.  A good example is the 20 Mule Team Borax commercial that used to come on on Sunday nights sponsoring some show.  I cried every week because, in my mind, those poor people didn't have a home and that was a sad thing.  Another example of my thought process involved a day out shopping.  My mother was always proud of me because I never asked for anything or threw tantrums when we would go shopping and I would want something that I couldn't have.  I was a good girl.  Well, I did slip every once in awhile.  This one particular shopping trip we were looking at shoes.  I wanted a new pair of sandals.  I think Joy Lynn got sandals and I wanted some too.  It wasn't on the list for that day.  I cried.  I didn't fuss, I just cried.  Mother wasn't pleased and told me so when we got home.  I decided to run away, which meant going across the street to my aunt's house and when I ran, I broke the sandals I already had.  I was sure I was being punished for wanting the new ones.  I still feel guilty over that.So, can you imagine what happened to me when I went to the grocery store a couple of days ago and brought home the bag with THIS written on the side of it?\"I am a brown paper bag.  More than likely, I'll end up under your sink with a few of my friends.  I might get cut up and wrapped around an old textbook, or just stuck under something messy.  It would be nice if someone made me into a kite.  I'd like to be a kite. But whatever happens, I will never forget the day I carried groceries home from Central Market\"If you need me you will probably find me in the yard flying a kite made from a brown paper bag as I shed tears for all the sad, sad paper bags in the world."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, September 12, 2007", "text": "Two years ago we moved to our new dwelling.  One of the appealing features of the new house was the ten acre field behind the property.  It was full of scrubby trees, weeds, vines and wildflowers.  At times it was a scary place -- a person could envision all sort of mysterious, dangerous, or unsavory activities going on back there.  But in the light of day, more the soft glow of dusk, there were the Bunnies.  The Bunnies lived in the field and would often escape to our back yard under the fence and help eat the birdfood and an occasional piece of carrot that found its way from my kitchen.  The raccoons lived there, too, and the hawks perched high in the cottonwood trees.  All of them visited our yard at one time or another.Our cat, Trevor, used to love the field.  Everyday she would leave the comfort of her place on our patio and venture into the wilds where she would practice her feline skills of hunting and stalking.  She was an amazing hunter and was so proud of herself.  She must have loved us very much because she would bring us gifts almost  daily.   Most times it would be mice or rats but once she captured a snake and her biggest catch of all was a bunny that was bigger than her.  The field took her, however, the day she disappeared.  I always looked into that field and knew she was there, somewhere, in her beloved field.The field is gone.  I don't know where the Bunnies are but I will keep a close watch near nightfall.  I know now that Trevor isn't in the field anymore.  The trees are gone along with all the wild growing things and the mystery and beauty of something natural, untouched and doing what God intended for it to do.Something else will replace the field.  We have known for months what it will be.  It will be a parking lot. I think they should erect a small memorial for the Bunnies."},

I had an adorable three year old son that took up more time than I had in a day -- what would I do with another one.  What would another one be like? What would another one look like? What would another one represent to me?  The \"what's\" took over and she became a reality.Did she look like I thought? No.  I was expecting a mimime.  Sort of short/tall, stocky in built, brunette.  Instead she is tall, lean, with the most gorgeous head of strawberry blond curly hair I have ever seen.Did she act like I thought? No.  Again, I was thinking something quiet and subdued.  She is not.  She is outgoing, animated, and driven.Did I figure out what to do with her? Yep.  I protected her from rough, brotherly play. I taught her as best as I knew how.  I loved her for what she was and in spite of what she wasn't.What does she represent to me?  A family complete.  I see much of myself in her -- some I like, some I don't. I see much of what I wanted to be in her. I admire her spunk and I worry over her vulnerability.  She represents the future to me, the carrying on of our family -- a link so to speak. As time marches on and roles are reversing, I see a little heroine in the making.  She will always be my child but she is so much more than that -- she is strong and honest and faithful and I am so thankful that God sent her to me.She doesn't want a cake for her birthday, she wants brownies.  So, brownies she will have."},

Rollie White Kittykat but he isn't white, that is the name of the football stadium at Texas A&M that he was named after.  We call him Rollie.  He is nearly a year old now.  He is a classic grey tabby and my husband likes him which makes him sort of a miracle cat."},

Well, that is how I felt this evening as I was surfing the internet with my father's name in the search box.My father was a \"rennaisance man\", self made.  He didn't have a lot of education but he had a lot of talent and a lot of dreams but not a lot of confidence.  He didn't believe in himself so much.  However, he was taken with the rapidly progressing technology of the times and jumped into tv and movie making with a passion.  He made three movies.  Now, granted, this was in TEXAS, not Hollywood so let's just say the resources were lacking.  But, made movies he did.  Now, decades and decades later the world feels it is their place to critique his work.There is one movie that survived to old age.  The original long since disappeared but copies have been popping up all over the place, many to be purchased on a number of places on the internet.  And the criticism.  My my, it is harsh.  But, it is consistent.  However, and this is where I feel like I am in a forest alone hollering, MY FATHER DID NOT BUILD HIS SETS OUT OF CARDBOARD!  My father was an artist and his sets were works or art.  They were solid.  They were good.  I should know.  I was there.  Also, the cast members were not ALL untalented scrubs.  Bill McNulty was a British import who acted in England and was big in SA little theater.  Eunice Gray was a neurosurgeon also huge in little theater.  Granted, that doesn't mean she was a great actress but she wasn't useless either.  You know, I would like to see one of the people who are so quick to dish out such demeaning remarks do as well as my father did.  Ha! That would be a good show in and of itself.I am done here.Ok, I am done."},

While journaling on the computer is convenient, I guess it just sort of takes away from what I was after.  SO.......in light of that I have decided to journal instead of blog.  Got me a little black and white composition book (so retro!) and have started to write down all the little bits of information that nobody is interested in but, one day, might be glad they know.  If they can slow down and settle down long enough to read something not on a screen.  I absolutely love technology.  For a middle aged gramma-to-be that is a bit odd, I guess.  At least everybody thinks it is but that is just me!  However, there is something to be said for retaining the traditional along with the new and improved.  Did you know that children don't know how to write in longhand anymore?  Wouldn't know what to do with an ink cartridge, much less an ink BOTTLE.  So sad.  But, time moves on and so must we but do we have to let go of the past completely to move on to the future?  Can't the two concepts co-exist?  I guess only in my generation.  Sigh."},

She was just this perfect little black and white cat that chose us. She was born at our house, one of many born at our house.  All the rest disappeared except her.  She stayed, she chose us. She had an important role at our house.  She was Tessie's caretaker -- a seeing-eye cat, if you will.  Two weeks ago I put her outside so I could take  Tessie to the vet.  As I cuddled her I verbalized \"I wonder if I will ever see you again\".  I don't know where that voice came from but I haven't seen her again and I miss her. She was special to me."}
