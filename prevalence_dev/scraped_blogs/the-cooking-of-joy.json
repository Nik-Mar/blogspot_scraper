{"title": "Taiwanese Braised Pork over Rice (滷肉飯)", "date": "Wednesday, January 25, 2023", "text": "I always thought the Mandarin phrase \"cha bu duo\" meant \"as much as you need\" because that's how my mom would respond whenever I asked her how much of an ingredient to add to a dish.  For instance, when I asked her how to make lu rou fan (Taiwanese braised pork over rice), she told me to add fried shallots, cooking wine, and soy sauce to the browned pork.  I asked her how much of each, and she just said \"cha bu duo\" in an exasperated voice. But when I asked her what that phrase meant, she explained it means \"more or less\". Google translates it to \"almost, nearly, similar\". None of that is helpful though without any actual measurements, haha.After several rounds of experimenting and the added guidance of TACL-LYF's Taiwanese Homestyle Cooking cookbook, I've come up with my preferred way to make this homey dish.  Some recipes call for using exclusively pork belly, but the version I grew up eating was made with only ground pork.  Using half ground pork and half pork belly is a nice compromise, but you can also just use only fatty ground pork.One ingredient I've started using that's kind of like a cheat code is Lee Kum Kee's pork bone soup base.  It comes super concentrated so I like to freeze it in small portions and just dissolve the amount I need for a particular recipe.  Not only does it add a lot of flavor, it's full of collagen that will add a nice sticky mouthfeel to the braised pork.  If you don't have any pork bone soup, you can just use water, and I've read that some people add unflavored gelatin to give it that same mouthfeel.If you want, you can add some peeled, boiled eggs to the pot while it's cooking to make lu dan (soy braised eggs), but I prefer my egg yolks jammy so I usually just marinate them separately.  I also like to serve this with some stir-fried greens like napa cabbage or bok choy, although sometimes if I'm really lazy, I'll just add the greens directly to the pot while it's cooking.Taiwanese Braised Pork over Rice (滷肉飯)makes 4 servings1/2 lb. ground pork1/2 lb. pork belly, chopped2 dried shiitake mushrooms1 tablespoon oil5 tablespoons fried shallots1 tablespoon rice wine1/2 cup reduced sodium soy sauce1 cup pork bone soup or water (see note above)1/2 tablespoon rock sugar1/2 teaspoon Joy's Five Spice1 star anise1/2 teaspoon white pepper4 cups steamed riceSoak the shiitake mushrooms in hot water for at least 15 minutes, then finely chop.In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat and add the mushrooms and fried shallots.  Cook for a minute or two until fragrant, then add the ground pork and chopped pork belly.  Continue to cook until the pork is cooked through and a little browned.  Add the rice wine to deglaze and then add the soy sauce, pork broth (or water), rock sugar, five spice powder, star anise, and white pepper.  Bring to a boil then turn the heat down to a simmer.  Let simmer for an hour, then serve over rice along with greens, pickled daikon, and a soy marinated egg if you like.Next:  Soy-Marinated Jammy EggsPreviously:  Sourdough Discard Okinomiyaki Waffles"},

{"title": "Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup (Updated)", "date": "Monday, March 14, 2022", "text": "Quite a few things have changed since I posted my first rendition of beef noodle soup on this blog 14 years ago (it was my 3rd blog post ever!):  I've gotten better at cooking; I went through a vegan, then vegetarian, then pescatarian stint; and I started posting on Instagram. I'd say I'm more of a social carnivore now in that I do eat meat when I'm out with friends but very rarely cook it at home.  In fact, I think I've only made beef noodle soup maybe once or twice since I posted the original recipe.  But after seeing all the delicious BNS posts on the Taiwanese Home Cooking FB group and receiving a chuck eye steak from Vermont Wagyu, I knew it was time to fix that.Looking back at the original BNS post, I was shocked to see that it called for 1.5 cups of soy sauce!  I chalk it up to one of those mistakes that happens when someone with little cooking experience tries to transcribe a recipe from someone who never measures anything when cooking.  I've since adjusted the quantity to a more reasonable 1/2 cup of low-sodium soy sauce.The original version calls for napa cabbage and angel hair pasta, and while both are perfectly fine to use, I now opt for the more photogenic baby bok choy and use more authentic Taiwanese dried noodles like A-Sha brand.  And for the lu dan, instead of cooking already hard-boiled eggs in the sauce, I prefer tucking chilled 7-minute boiled eggs in the soup after it's been strained and cooling.  This way the yolks remain nice and jammy while the whites absorb the delicious flavor.A few other changes:  I've listed white peppercorns, a cinnamon stick, and bay leaf as optional spices in addition to the star anise.  If you don't have them it's fine, but if you have them it will add a nice complexity to the soup.  The star anise is an absolute must, though, to make this a Taiwanese beef noodle soup.  Lastly, I stole this idea from Kenji's recipe--since almost all soups taste better the next day, I remove the beef from the soup, then strain everything else out before letting it chill overnight in the fridge.Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soupmakes about 2-3 servings1 lb. chuck steak, cut into 1\" chunks1 tablespoon oil, if needed2 scallions, cut into 2\" pieces1 inch ginger, sliced3 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed1 tomato, skinned and roughly chopped1 star anise1 teaspoon white peppercorns (optional)1 cinnamon stick (optional)3 tablespoons rock sugar1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce1/2 cup Shaoxing rice wine2 cups beef broth1 bay leaf (optional)3 large eggsBaby bok choy or napa cabbage, blanchedNoodles, cookedChili oil/sauce (like Sze Daddy), optionalIf there is a lot of extraneous fat on the steak, you can cut it off and render it in a large Dutch oven or pot (add it to the pot cold then turn the heat to medium).  Otherwise, heat the oil in the pot and add the beef.  Flip the beef around to brown all the sides, then remove from the pot. Add the scallions, ginger, garlic, star anise, tomato, and white peppercorns and cinnamon stick, if using, to the pot and cook for a couple of minutes until very fragrant.  Add the rock sugar and stir around until it has mostly dissolved.  Return the beef to the pot and deglaze the bottom with the soy sauce and wine.  Add the beef broth and bay leaf, if using, and bring to a simmer.  Cover and continue to simmer on low for an hour.In the meantime, bring another pot of water to boil.  Add the eggs (straight from the fridge) to the pot and set the timer for 7 minutes.  Prepare an ice bath.  After 7 minutes, remove the eggs from the pot and plunge them into the ice bath.  Once they are cool enough to handle, peel the eggs and set aside in the fridge to chill.After an hour, check the beef for tenderness and the soup for flavor.  Cook longer or adjust seasonings if needed.  When the beef is ready, transfer from the soup into another pot or container large enough to hold the soup.  Strain the rest of the soup into the pot/container with the beef in it.  Add the peeled eggs, cover, let come to room temperature, then place in the fridge overnight.When ready to serve, reheat the soup (remove the eggs first if you want to keep them jammy).  Blanch the veggies in boiling water until bright green and tender.  Remove and then cook the noodles in the same boiling water.  Drain and portion the noodles into 3 bowls, ladle the soup and beef over the noodles and add the veggies.  Slice the eggs in half and add to the bowl.  Serve with chili sauce (I like Sze Daddy for additional Taiwanese flavors) if you like.Previously:  No Knead Sourdough FocacciaNext:  Hurricane Popcorn Marshmallow Treats"},

{"title": "My Sourdough Challah", "date": "Sunday, September 13, 2020", "text": "I learned recently that there are at least 2 different kinds of challah:  the sweet, eggy Ashkenazi version which is probably what most people think of when they think of challah, and the Sephardic version, which is found in the Breaking Breads and Pastry Love cookbooks.  I've made both versions, but I like making the Sephardic version more because the dough is a lot easier for me to work with.My go-to challah recipe is based off of the one from Pastry Love, except I substitute 50 g of my 100% hydration sourdough starter for 25 of flour, 25 g of water, and half the yeast.  The resulting bread doesn't have the full sourdough tang, but I find it easier to digest than the kind made with just commercial yeast.  If you have a very active starter, you might be able to get away with using less yeast or even forgoing it altogether, but I'm usually using starter that's been left to ferment on my counter overnight so it's not at its most active which is why I add some commercial yeast for insurance.My Sourdough Challahmakes 1 loaf50 g sourdough starter, 100% hydration95 g warm water4 g active or instant yeast40 g sugar2 large eggs (1 for the dough, 1 for the egg wash)45 g vegetable oil325 g all-purpose flour7 g kosher saltMix the starter and water together in the bowl of a stand mixer.  Sprinkle on the yeast and allow to dissolve before adding the sugar, 1 egg, oil, and flour.  Knead using the dough hook on low for about 5 minutes until the dough comes together.  Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.  Sprinkle on the salt and knead on low for 8 more minutes.  Cover again and let rest for 90 minutes at warm room temperature.Uncover the dough and punch down.  Fold over the 4 corners of the dough, recover and let rest another 90 minutes.  While the dough is fermenting, make an egg wash by whisking together the 2nd egg, 1 scant tablespoon of water, and a pinch of salt.  Mix well but try not to make too many air bubbles.Punch down the dough again and divide into even portions (the number will depend on how many strands you want; for reference, the first two pictures in this post are a 7-strand braid and the last two are an 8-strand braid).  Working one at a time, press each portion into a rough rectangle.  You want to try to remove any large air bubbles at this point because they will form weak points in your strand.  To form the strand, you will be rolling over the long side of the rectangle like a jelly roll.  To help maintain tension in the dough, use your fingertips to gently push the portion you just rolled over back into the dough all along the length of the dough.  (I highly suggest you watching my IGTV video which shows you how to form the strands since it's much easier to show you than explain how to do it.)  When you get to the bottom of the dough, pinch the seam together and roll the log out a couple of times on the work surface to create a taut surface and start shaping it into a long strand.  At this point you can also taper the ends if you want.  Set aside and work on the next strand.Once you've shaped all the strands into logs, start with the first log you formed and roll it out into a longer snake.  Set aside and work on the next one.  Once you've roll them all out into longer snakes, give them one last roll to their final length.  Allowing the dough to rest in between the 3 shaping rounds lets the dough relax a little and not shrink back so much.  Braid and form the strands into your desired shape.  Transfer to a parchment paper lined baking sheet.  Brush on a thin, even layer of the egg wash, trying not to let too much settle in between the strands.  Let rest for 90-120 minutes in a warm, draft-free area (I use my microwave).  Preheat the oven to 350℉.When the dough is nice and puffy, turn it 180° from the position it was when you applied the egg wash and brush on another thin, even layer.  Turning the loaf helps ensure that you don't miss any of the surface.  Bake the loaf for 30-35 minutes, turning once halfway, until it is evenly browned.  Let completely cool before slicing.  Store in a paper bag for up to 3 days.Previously:  Sourdough Belgian WafflesNext: General Tso's Tofu"},
{"title": "Sourdough Belgian Waffles", "date": "Saturday, August 1, 2020", "text": "Well this is my first post in almost a year, so you know these are worth making!  I've been trying to find a sourdough waffle recipe that I like as much as Smitten Kitchen's essential raised waffles, but none of the ones I tried really had the flavor or texture I was looking for.Then two things happened:  my friend Arthur sold me his Belgian waffle maker, and I tried making a half batch of  The Kitchen McCabe's sourdough Belgian waffles, only I started the first part of the batter late at night and didn't realize until the following morning that I had only used like a tablespoon of my sourdough starter in the batter instead of a full cup.  But the waffles were AMAZING.  Light and lacy, crispy on the outside and custardy on the inside, with enough flavor that you could eat it without any syrup or butter.I needed to make sure I could replicate the waffles again, so I asked for testers on my Instagram page, and thankfully quite a few people responded.  Out of ~50 testers, 80% loved the waffles whereas the rest were less impressed.  The chief complaint was that they never got crispy or lost their crispiness too soon.  When I tried the recipe again myself, I noticed the same thing, but I did find that reheating the waffles in my toaster oven made them much crispier.Another comment was that they were too salty.  I realized that I had listed the kosher salt by volume instead of weight, and since I use Diamond Crystal kosher salt, another other kind of salt was going produce a must saltier waffle.  Lesson learned!Since such a small amount of starter is used in the recipe, it doesn't seem to matter much what kind of starter you use, but for what it's worth, my starter I keep is 100% hydration and fed with half AP flour and half whole wheat flour.  I tested these waffles once with more sourdough starter and once with milk instead of water.  I couldn't really tell too much of a difference with the former but found the latter to be even softer than the ones with water and with no added flavor.All in all, I'd say these are the perfect waffles for someone who doesn't particularly like the flavor of sourdough in their waffles, but has sourdough starter and no milk, haha.  Since such a small amount of starter is used in the batter and it's such a runny batter, the rise you get is more from the baking soda in the waffle iron than from the sourdough.  It seems to help if you have one of those Belgian waffle makers that you flip too, but people had success with regular waffle irons, too.  This recipe doubles quite easily too, if you have more mouths to feed.Sourdough Belgian Wafflesmakes about 3-4 Belgian waffles, depending on the size of your waffle iron10-50 g sourdough starter (does not need to be active starter; discard is fine)120 g (1/2 cup) room temperature water90 g flour (I like to use 25 g whole wheat flour + 65 g all-purpose flour)42 g (3 tablespoons) melted butter, slightly cooled1 g (1/2 teaspoon) Diamond Crystal kosher salt15 g (1 tablespoon) honey1 large egg, lightly beaten4 g (1 teaspoon) vanilla extract1/4 teaspoon baking sodaThe night before, mix together the sourdough starter, water, and flours.  Cover and let sit at room temperature overnight.In the morning, add the melted butter, salt, honey, egg, and vanilla extract.  Start heating up your waffle iron.  When it is ready, stir the baking soda into the waffle batter and mix well.  Lightly grease the iron and add ~1/2 cup batter to the iron and cook until golden brown.  Serve immediately or freeze.P.S  If you'd like a really simple recipe for blueberry syrup, you can find it in the caption of this Instagram post.Previously:  Snowskin Cake Truffle MooncakesNext:  My Sourdough Challah"},
{"title": "Snowskin Cake Truffle Mooncakes", "date": "Wednesday, August 28, 2019", "text": "The mooncakes I grew up eating were the golden, baked kind--usually filled with red bean or lotus seed paste and sometimes even a salted egg yolk inside.  It's so ubiquitous that iOS has an emoji for them (while there still isn't an emoji for waffles??).  They were good, but oh so heavy and dense; it was hard to eat more than a few tiny slices.  Luckily, a few different kinds have popped up since I was a child like the swirly, flaky Taiwanese version I made a few years ago.  Even more recently, I've been seeing snowskin mooncakes where the skin is made with glutinous rice flour resulting in a soft, translucent skin.I did some research on how to make them, and it looks like there's a hard way with a lot of ingredients and steps and an easy way with just a few ingredients and no steaming involved.  I already know how difficult it can be to work with mochi, so I went with the easy way by following the directions from Kirbie's Cravings and Tiny Urban Kitchen.The first step is either sourcing roasted glutinous rice flour or making your own.  Since I already had some flour at home, I tried dry roasting it in my wok.  It's not hard to do, but it does take a little patience and a lot of stirring before you get that first wisp of smoke.  Then you sift it together with powdered sugar before rubbing in a fat like shortening.  I've tried using coconut oil and butter and both tasted great, but since butter has a slightly higher melting point, it's easier to work with.The hardest part for me was figuring out how much liquid to add to make the dough.  If you don't add enough it'll be too crumbly to work with, and if you add too much, it'll be too sticky.  I found the hard way that if you overdo it with the liquid, you can add in some more powdered sugar to bring it back to the right consistency.Then there's the matter of the filling.  I knew I didn't want to go with the traditional heavy fillings and wanted to come up with something that might be more accessible for the American pantry and palate.  It had to be something pliable enough to mold, firm enough to keep its shape, wouldn't need additional cooking, and hopefully stable at room temperature.  I considered a cheesecake type filling or cookie dough before I thought of an even better idea:  cake truffles!  You may know them as cake balls or cake pops, but it's what you get when you mix cake crumbs with frosting or another binder, roll them up and cover with chocolate or candy melt.It's incredibly easy to make and there's a million different variations.  I made some to bring to a friend's birthday party, and since she loves watermelon, I baked a strawberry box mix cake, mixed it with some frosting and mini-chocolate chips, and wrapped it with pandan flavored snowskin so it looked like a watermelon.  I also make some with non-dyed snowskin and Funfetti cake inside for a birthday cake mooncake.  My favorite version so far has been using the chocolate chip-passion fruit cake truffle from All About Cake and wrapping it with a snowskin made with passion fruit pulp instead of water.Snowskin Cake Truffle Mooncakesmakes about 35 mooncakes using a 50 g mooncake moldFor the cake truffle filling:9\"x13\" cake, baked and cooled Mix-ins like mini-chocolate chips or sprinkles (optional)Binder, like frosting or fruit juiceUse your hands to crumble the cake into crumbs.  Add your mix-in, if using, and toss to combine.  Add your binder, a little at a time, until you can squeeze the mixture and it holds its shape.  Use a cookie dough scoop to form about 35 balls.For the snowskin:250 grams sweet glutinous rice flour225 grams powdered sugar, plus more for rolling75 grams butter or coconut oil125 grams water or other liquid like fruit juiceFood coloring and/or flavor extract, optionalIn a large skillet or wok, dry roast the rice flour over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it starts to smoke and change color.  Allow to cool to room temperature, then sift together with the powdered sugar into a medium bowl.  Add the butter or coconut oil and then rub it into the dry mixture until well combined.  If using the food coloring and/or flavor extract, add to the water.  Add half of the liquid to the bowl and mix together.  Gradually add more of the liquid until the mixture is soft and pliable but not tacky.  It's a fine line between a crumbly and sticky texture so go slowly.Pinch off about a walnut size lump of the mixture and roll out into a thin disc on a surface dusted with powdered sugar.  Wrap the snowskin around one of the cake balls.  If there is extra snowskin after wrapping the cake ball, pinch it off and return it to the rest of the mixture.  If you need more, pinch off a bit from the mixture and patch up the hole.  Place the wrapped cake ball on the counter, seal side down, and make sure it will fit into the mooncake mold.  If it is too wide, use your hands to gently shape it narrower and taller.  Use a 50 g mooncake mold to press it into shape and release.  Repeat with the rest of the snowskin dough and cake balls.  You can store the mooncakes in an airtight container in the fridge for 1-2 days or 1-2 weeks in the freezer.  Let thaw before serving.Previously:  Mochi Waffles"},

{"title": "Bacon Fat Scallion Pancakes", "date": "Sunday, December 30, 2018", "text": "I've been making scallion pancakes the same way for years using a recipe I got from one of my chef friends, but recently I tried a different recipe based on a recommendation from the same friend and discovered this one makes just as good, if not better scallion pancakes in a lot less time!One of the main ingredients for the recipe she sent me was lard, but since I don't usually have that in stock, I tried substituting with bacon fat.  I'm surprised no one else came up with this combo before because it's basically combining two of the greatest tasting things in the world into one.  I fiddled around with the other ingredients a bit to balance out the extra flavor from the bacon fat and ended up with this recipe.  I think it's flavorful enough to not need a dipping sauce, but if you really want one, you can mix up some soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, and hot sauce to your liking.Bacon Fat Scallion Pancakesmakes 5 pancakes300 gram all-purpose flour6 grams kosher salt, divided10 grams sugar175 grams warm water30 grams chopped scallions (about the amount from 1 bunch of scallions)50 grams bacon fat, meltedVegetable oil for fryingMix the flour, 2 grams of salt, sugar, and warm water together and knead for 5 minutes until it forms a cohesive ball of dough.  Cover and let rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.In the meantime, chop the scallions, melt the bacon fat, and measure out the remaining 4 grams of salt.Divide the dough into 5 equal portions (I like to use the scale for this).  Roll out one of the portions into a rectangle.  Flip the dough occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the work surface.  When it won't get any thinner with a rolling pin, gently stretch the dough out with your hands to get it even thinner, but stop if the dough starts to rip.Spoon a fifth of the melted bacon fat on top of the dough and spread it all around with the back of the spoon.  Sprinkle a large pinch and a half of salt all over and then do the same with a fifth of the chopped scallions.Starting from the long edge, roll up the dough to form a long rope.  Don't worry about making a tight coil; focus on making the dough as thin as possible by continuing to gently stretch it out as you roll it up.  Once you've formed a long rope, coil it up into a spiral with the seam side down and tuck the end underneath.  Use your palm to squash the coil into a flatter disc.  Set aside and repeat with the other 4 pieces of dough.Heat up a frying pan over medium high heat with enough oil to generously coat the bottom.  If you have any leftover bacon fat you can add it to the oil.  While the oil is heating, use your hands or a rolling pin to flatten one of the discs even more.  Aim for the pancake to be a little less than 1/4\" thick, but don't flatten it completely or else you'll lose all the layers.Fry the pancake until golden brown on one side and flip.  It's okay if you need to flip it a few times to get it evenly browned on both sides.  While you're waiting for it to cook, go ahead and flatten the next pancake.  When the pancake is done, transfer it to a wire rack.  Make sure you have enough oil left in the pan and fry the next one.If you have any leftovers, I like to quarter and freeze them so that I can use my compact air fryer to reheat them.Next:  Mochi WafflesPreviously:  My Communion BreadLast Year:  Pork, Cabbage, and Tofu DumplingsTwo Years Ago:  Cranberry Curd TartFour Years Ago:  Puppy Chow PieFive Years Ago:  Miso Pumpkin SoupSix Years Ago:  Thomas Keller's Lemon TartNine Years Ago:  Tim Tam Slam Ice CreamTen Years Ago:  Curry Turnovers"},
{"title": "My Communion Bread", "date": "Tuesday, September 25, 2018", "text": "I've been making sourdough bread for one of my church's services every week for communion for a while now and figured it was finally time to write up how I make it.  This is loosely based on the country loaf from Tartine Bread, a wonderful book that goes a lot deeper into the methods involved.  I highly recommend picking up a copy and reading it through at least once to not only understand how sourdoughs work but also to be inspired by the process.I was lucky enough to get a sourdough starter from a friend instead of having to start one from scratch.  The first thing you should probably know about a starter is that you'll need to feed it periodically.  This means discarding the majority of it* and adding some more water and flour to the remaining bit and letting it get all bubbly and doubled in volume.  I feed my starter with a 50/50 mixture of all purpose flour and whole wheat flour and an equal amount of water by weight (e.g. 25 g of all purpose flour, 25 g of whole wheat flour, and 50 g water).  Some people do this daily, or even more than once a day, but since I really only make bread once a week, I keep my starter in the fridge and just feed it the day before I want to bake it.  If I happen to be traveling and can't feed it for more than a week, I'll do a few rounds of feeding until it starts smelling and acting like I'm used to before I use it.Some of the equipment you'll want to invest in are a food scale (to weigh the ingredients with), digital thermometer, bench scraper, banneton (to hold the shaped dough for its second rise), parchment paper, a lame or razor blade to score the loaf with, and a Dutch oven or cast iron combo cooker to bake the loaf in.  The only Dutch oven I own is actually an oval one and not wide enough for the round loaves I make, so I came up with another solution for trapping the steam in:  I bake my bread on a pre-heated baking stone and invert a stock pot over it.Timing wise, I feed my starter the morning of the day before I want to bake.  It takes about half a day for it to get fully active.  Then I add the rest of the ingredients and do a few rounds of folding over the next 3-4 hours.  I'll shape it, place it in a banneton, and let it do its final rise overnight in the fridge.  The next morning I'll preheat the oven and take the dough out when the oven is ready, score it while it's still cold, and bake it.  So it takes about 24 hours from start to finish but could be shorter if you do the second proof at room temperature or longer if you leave the dough in the fridge.My dough ends up being about 73% hydration, which for me hits the sweet spot of being easy to work with but still wet enough to produce an evenly open crumb.  I still mess up my shaping all the time, but thankfully the loaves just get cut up into cubes to be used for communion, so no one can really tell.  I hope this guide helps you in your sourdough exploration, and please let me know if you have any questions about my process!*If you hate discarding starter all the time, you can use it to make other baked goods like pizza dough, English muffins, even pancakes and banana bread!My Communion Breadmakes 1 loafFor the starter:About a tablespoon of sourdough starter (I use a 100% hydration starter with 50/50 all purpose flour and whole wheat flour)100 grams lukewarm water, about 80°F50 grams all purpose flour50 grams whole wheat flour Use a spoon to mix the starter with the warm water.  Add the flours and mix until no dry bits remain.  Let sit in a warm spot until it has doubled in volume, usually about 4-6 hours depending on how active and warm it is.  You can check to see if the starter is fully active by dropping a spoonful into some cold water.  If it floats, the starter has built up enough gas and is ready to be used.  Weigh out 100 grams into a large bowl and place the rest of the starter in the fridge until next week.For the bread:100 grams active starter350 grams warm water, about 80°F, plus more for your hands450 grams all purpose flour50 grams whole wheat or spelt flour10 grams kosher saltRice flour, for dustingUse a spoon to mix the active starter with the warm water.  Then add the flours and mix until no dry bits remain.  Cover and let sit in a warm spot for 25-40 minutes.Sprinkle the salt evenly over the top of the dough.  Wet one hand thoroughly and dribble some water over the salt to start dissolving it.  Using the hand that's wet, grab a quarter of the dough, pull it up and fold it over the top of the dough.  Rotate the bowl 90° and repeat 3 more times until the salt is completely encased.  Pinch the dough a couple of times to separate it into a few pieces, turn it, and smush it back together again before repeating the stretch and fold process.  Repeat the pinch, rotate, stretch, and fold process until the salt is fully dissolved and incorporated into the dough, wetting your hand whenever the dough starts getting sticky again.  Cover and set the timer for 30 minutes.When the timer goes off, wet your hand again and do another 4 stretch-and-folds, rotating the bowl 90° each time.  After the last fold, turn the dough over so that the seam is underneath.  Cover and set the timer for another 30 minutes.  Repeat this every 30 minutes for a total of 3 hours.  At this point the dough will be a lot more relaxed and have risen a bit.  If you press a wet fingertip into the dough, the indent should almost disappear within a few seconds.Flour a work surface and gently transfer the dough onto the flour.  Grab a quarter of the dough, stretch it up and fold it over, then repeat 3 more times on the other corners of the dough to create a taut surface underneath.  Dust the top with a little more flour and then flip it over.  Use a bench scraper or your hands to gently tuck the sides under and form a half dome.  Let sit for 20-30 minutes.  In the meantime, dust the banneton with rice flour so that your dough won't stick to it.  After the dough has rested, lightly flour the top and flip it upside down with the bench scraper.  Apply another set of stretch-and-folds and flip it over again.  Slide the ball around on the work surface until it forms a nice, taut half dome.  Use the bench scraper to quickly transfer the dough upside down into the banneton.  Cover (I use a shower cap) and place in the refrigerator for about 12-14 hours.Place a Dutch oven or a baking stone and stock pot in the oven and preheat to 475°F.  When the oven is ready, take the banneton out of the fridge and invert the dough onto a large piece of parchment paper.  Dust the top with some rice flour if you want some definition to your scoring pattern.  Wipe the excess flour off and use a lame or razor blade to score the loaf.Quickly transfer the dough and parchment paper into the Dutch oven or onto the baking stone.  Cover with the lid or stock pot.  Reduce the oven temperature to 450°F and bake for 20 minutes.  After 20 minutes, carefully remove the lid or stock pot and continue to bake for another 20-25 minutes until nicely browned.  Listen to the bread crackle as it cools.  Try to wait at least an hour before slicing.Next:  Bacon Fat Scallion PancakesPreviously:  Tomato and Eggs over Rice (Updated)Last Year:  Blueberry

{"title": "Cherry Pit Ice Cream with Cherry Ripple and Brown Butter Streusel", "date": "Wednesday, July 25, 2018", "text": "Have you ever heard of cherry pit ice cream?  Apparently within the pits of all stone fruits (cherries, peaches, nectarines, etc.) is a white kernel that smells like an almond.  If you steep the kernels in alcohol, you can make a bitter almond extract, and if you steep them in an ice cream base, you can make a delicious ice cream with a subtle almond taste.Getting to the kernel requires smashing the pits open, which can get kind of messy.  Additionally, a toxic chemical, amygdalin, may be released when doing so, but apparently it can be neutralized by cooking.  So it's up to you if you want to break the pits open to get to the kernel or not, but I did so because 1. it's fun to smash things, and 2. I wanted to extract as much of the bitter almond flavor as possible.I used the blank slate Philadelphia-style ice cream recipe from Hello, My Name Is Ice Cream, as the base for the ice cream and added a cherry ripple for fruitiness and brown butter streusel for crunch.  Both the ripple and streusel are also adapted from recipes in Hello, My Name is Ice Cream.  I really love the combination of all 3 parts, especially the streusel, because I really enjoy the extra texture it provides.Cherry Pit Ice Cream with Cherry Ripple and Brown Butter Streuselmakes about 1 quartFor the cherry ripple:1 lb. sour cherries*50 g sugar50 g corn syrupRemove the stems and pit the cherries, reserving the pits.  Combine the cherries, sugar, and corn syrup in a saucepan and cook over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved.Transfer to a blender and blend until smooth.  Return the contents to the saucepan and continue to cook until thick and jammy.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve.  Store in the refrigerator until ready to use.*Note, I made this with sour cherries, but if you want to use sweet cherries, you'll probably want to reduce the amount of sugar and corn syrup.For the brown butter streusel:37 g unsalted butter50 g flourScant 1/8 teaspoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon kosher salt25 g brown sugar25 g sugarPreheat the oven to 350°F and line a sheet pan with parchment paper or a Silpat.Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until the milk solids have separated and started to brown.  Immediately remove from the heat and set aside to cool down.Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugars.  Add the browned butter and mix until there are no dry bits.  Transfer the streusel to the sheet pan and break up any large lumps.Bake for 10 minutes, then stir the streusel to redistribute on the pan.  Bake for another 10-15 minutes until the streusel is golden brown and cooked through.  Cool the streusel on a wire rack and then store in the freezer until ready to use.For the cherry pit ice cream:Pits from the pound of sour cherries380 g cream400 g milk (plus 2 tablespoons of milk if using cornstarch)50 g corn syrup20 g milk powder150 g sugar10 g cornstarch or 3 g commercial stabilizerPlace the cherry pits in a sturdy freezer bag and cover with a dish towel.  Use a heavy saucepan or mallet to crack the pits open to expose the white kernels within.  I would suggest doing this on the ground with a cutting board underneath because there's a good chance you'll make some holes in the bag.Place the cracked pits and kernels in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan and add the cream, milk, and corn syrup.  Cook over medium heat until the mixture reaches a boil, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching.  In the meantime, prepare a large ice water bath.  When the mixture is boiling, transfer to a metal bowl and place in the ice water bath.  Stirring occasionally, bring the mixture down to room temperature and then chill in the fridge for 4-6 hours.Mix the milk powder, sugar, and commercial stabilizer, if using, in a small bowl.  If using the cornstarch, mix with 2 tablespoons of cold milk.  Prepare another ice water bath.After the ice cream base has finished steeping, strain through a fine-mesh sieve into the saucepan and whisk in the milk powder mixture.  Bring to a boil again, stirring to prevent scorching.  Continue to cook for 2 minutes, then add the cornstarch slurry, if using, and continue to cook for another minute until slightly thickened.Pour the ice cream base into a metal bowl and place in the ice water bath.  Stirring occasionally, bring the mixture down to room temperature and then chill in the fridge for 4 hour or overnight.  Place a storage container in the freezer.Churn the ice cream base in your ice cream machine until thick and creamy.Spoon a layer of the cherry ripple on the bottom of the storage container.  Scatter some of the streusel over the ripple, then spread a third of the ice cream into the container.  Drizzle a third of the ripple over the ice cream and sprinkle a third of the streusel over that.  Repeat the layers two more times (you may have cherry ripple than you need; if so, save in the fridge for up to 2 weeks).  Press a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the ice cream, cover with the lid, and freeze for at least 4 hours, until completely firm.Next:  Tomato and Eggs over Rice (Updated)Previously:  Sourdough Discard Pizza DoughLast Year:  Greyscale Cream PuffsTwo Years Ago:  My Mom's Beef and Broccoli Stir FryThree Years Ago:  Pasta con le SardeFour Years Ago:  Strawberry Pop Tart Slab PieFive Years Ago:  Zuni Cafe's Fried Eggs in Bread CrumbsEight Years Ago:  Slow Cooker Bolognese Sauce"},
{"title": "Sourdough Discard Pizza Dough", "date": "Sunday, July 8, 2018", "text": "I've been making sourdough bread once a week now for the last couple of months, and I've been lamenting all the sourdough discard I've had to throw away (plus, it stinks up my trash can!).  My friend Alison who originally gave me the sourdough starter also mentioned that I could find some recipes online that used sourdough discard.  That gave me the idea to try to use it for pizza dough.Since I've been using the Tartine Bread country loaf recipe, the starter I use is 100% hydration with a 50/50 mix of all-purpose and whole wheat flour.  I basically just applied that math to the pizza dough I've been making the last few years and found that it works pretty well and even adds a little more flavor.After making the same recipe for so many years, it's naturally migrated towards what works for me in my kitchen.  To account for the addition of the sourdough discard, I reduced the amount of yeast I add to just a pinch.  If you have enough time and want even more flavor, you could probably omit the additional yeast altogether.  I add it for insurance, just in case the discard isn't active enough.  Update:  My sourdough starter is now active enough I don't add the extra yeast!Sourdough Discard Pizza Doughmakes two 8 oz. balls of pizza dough (enough for two 10\" pizzas)50 grams sourdough discard (100% hydration)150 grams warm water (about 90-95°F)225 grams all-purpose flour5 grams kosher saltA pinch of yeast (optional, use if your starter discard isn't very active)Olive oilMix the sourdough discard and warm water together in a medium mixing bowl.  Add the flour and mix until there are no dried bits left.  Cover and let sit 20-30 minutes.Sprinkle the salt and yeast over the dough.  Wet one of your hands thoroughly with warm water and use it to knead the salt into the dough until you can't feel it anymore.  Refer to my original pizza dough post for the fold and pinch method.  You should rewet your hands a few times during this process to keep the dough from sticking to you and to help the salt dissolve.  Cover and let rest.After 30-60 minutes, apply a fold to help develop the gluten.  During the last fold I dribble some olive oil into the bottom of the bowl and then flip the dough over so the seam is on the bottom and the top (which used to be on the bottom) is coated with oil.  Cover and let rest until the dough has doubled in volume, around 6 hours depending on the temperature of your kitchen and how active the sourdough discard is.Prepare 2 sandwich bags by folding the tops over and adding a little olive oil to each.  Flour your work surface and transfer the dough onto it.  Flour a knife or scraper and divide the dough in half.  Shape each half into a ball.  Transfer to the bags, seal, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to 2 days.  You can also freeze the dough until ready to use; just thaw it in the fridge overnight the day before you want pizza.Next:  Cherry Pit Ice Cream with Cherry Ripple and Brown Butter StreuselPreviously:  Strawberry Matcha Cream Cheese TartLast Year:  3-28 Slab PieTwo Years Ago:  My Mom's Beef and Broccoli Stir FryThree Years Ago:  Pasta con le SardeFour Years Ago:  Cleveland Cassata CakeFive Years Ago:  Bubble Tea PopsiclesEight Years Ago:  Coconut Lime Sorbet"},

{"title": "My Mom's Taiwanese Zongzi (粽子)", "date": "Sunday, March 18, 2018", "text": "I've been paddling in the annual Boston Dragon Boat Festival for over a decade now, and every year I consider trying to make zongzi, the traditional food eaten for the festival, but by the time the festival rolls around, I always find myself too busy with the races or traveling to attempt them.  This year I decided to get a head start (the festival is celebrated on the 5th day of the 5th month of the lunar calendar, so June 18 this year).  If you don't know what zongzi are, they're packets of sticky rice wrapped in bamboo leaves (or sometimes lotus or banana leaves).  The fillings differ depending on where you are, and sometimes they're even sweet!  The ones I grew up with were filled with marinated pork, shiitake mushrooms, fried shallots, peanuts, and sometimes chestnuts and/or dried baby shrimp.  I've also had versions with salted duck egg yolks and Chinese sausage in them too.Even beyond the fillings there are different ways to wrap zongzi.  The ones my mom makes are shaped like tetrahedrons, whereas I've also seen them wrapped in a rectangular shape.  Some of the recipes I've found online cook the zongzi in boiling water for up to 8 hours, but because the filling is cooked before being stuff in the sticky rice, you only need to cook these for an hour.  My mom told me that in southern Taiwan they boil it for even shorter by wrapping cooked sticky rice and boiling just long enough to impart the bamboo leaf flavor.I posted a picture of these zongzi on Instagram and mentioned that when I had asked my mom for the recipe, she told me it would be too hard to make.  I don't think my mom has ever told me something would be too hard for me to do before, so it only made me want to make them even more.  I was really surprised to read in the comments though that a lot of other people had the same reaction from their mothers when they had asked them for their recipe!  I wonder if that's what their moms told them too, and they're just passing the advice along.Since these are indeed very difficult to make, I wanted to share some of the tips I figured out while trying to figure it out myself:Soak at least 1.5 times as many leaves as you think you'll need.  A good portion of mine would tear while I was trying to wrap them at which point you have to start all over.  Don't throw those leaves away, though!  Fold them in half vertically, and use wrap the outside of any of your more precariously wrapped zongzi to add another layer of protection.Be very careful handling the leaves.  The edges are razor sharp and will give you a wicked paper cut!My mom folds the bottom of the leaves up so that the root ends don't stick out, but a lot of other people just cut that end off.  My mom ties a bunch of strings to a doorknob so there's tension on the string when you try to tie it around the zongzi with one hand (the other hand is used to hold the zongzi tightly closed).  Some of my friends mentioned that their moms would use a broomstick set across two chairs for the same purpose.  I read somewhere that you can also hold one end of the string between your teeth, and actually that method worked the best for me, although I know my dentist friends would definitely frown on that because there's a chance of chipping your tooth from all the tension.I found that the easiest way to tie the string around the zongzi was to place it close to the anchored end and use your free hand to wrap the other end of the string multiple times around the zongzi.  You want to try to wrap it around the \"equator\" of the tetrahedron, so that there are two corners on either end.  This will help keep the string in place, otherwise it may fall off when you're cooking it (I know from experience).I made this video to show you how to wrap the zongzi, but after showing it my mom to confirm it's how she wraps hers, she said she does it differently!Then she sent me a link to this video which she said is more like how she wraps it.  I love listening to it because you hear a mixture of Taiwanese and Mandarin which is kind of like what I heard growing up.  That said, if you wrap it my way, you'll get smaller zongzi and will probably be able to make at least 24 with the amount of ingredients below.  If you wrap it the way my mom does, you'll make fewer but, larger ones.Taiwanese-Style Zongzimakes 12-24 depending on how you wrap them3 1/2 cups glutinous rice6 oz. bamboo leaves8 dried shiitake mushrooms1/2 cup raw peanuts2/3 cup soy sauce, divided2 tablespoons rice wine2 tablespoons sugar, divided1 lb. pork belly1 tablespoon oil2 tablespoons fried shallotsKitchen twineSoak glutinous rice in room temperature water for 2 hours or overnight.Soak bamboo leaves in room temperature water for an hour or overnight, weighing them down so they're completely submerged.Soak shiitake mushrooms in room temperature water for an hour or overnight, also weighing them down so they're completely submerged.  Soak the peanuts for an hour or overnight in a separate bowl.Combine 1/3 cup soy sauce, the rice wine, and 1 tablespoon of sugar in a medium bowl.  Slice the pork into bite-sized pieces and marinate in the soy mixture for an hour.Cut the kitchen twine into 60\" pieces (this is easy for me since that's my wingspan).  Gather them all together and fold in half.  Make a loop knot at that halfway point so that there are now twice as many pieces of 30\" long twine connected at the top by a loop knot.  Wash the bamboo leaves thoroughly after they've softened.  Drain the rice and then add the remaining soy sauce and sugar and mix.  Cut the ends off the mushrooms and slice the caps into quarters.  Drain the peanuts.Heat a large wok or pan over medium heat and add the oil.  Add the sliced mushroom, pork, and fried shallots.  Stir fry until the pork is almost completely cooked through.  Transfer to a bowl.  Add any liquids left in the pan to the rice and mix well.Set up your work station:  hook the twine over a sturdy latch-style doorknob or cabinet handle*.  Have the bamboo leaves, seasoned sticky rice, peanuts, and meat mixture nearby with a large spoon.Grab two of the leaves and with the smooth sides facing you, position them so that they overlap slightly on the bottom and angle towards each other at the top.  Fold the bottom half inch up and over so that the tough root end doesn't stick out anymore (or cut off the bottom half inch)*.  Now fold the sides of the bottom of the leaves together like a book.  Fold the bottom inch or two up along one side and then open up the leaves so that it forms a short cone.Continue to grip the bottom of the cone with one hand and use the other hand to place a large spoonful or two of the rice in the cone.  Pack it down well, then add a spoonful of the cooked filling, making sure to get a bit of each of the ingredients.  Cover the filling with another spoonful of the rice and pack it down again.  Fold the top of the leaves over the rice so that now you have a 4-sided pyramid.  Fold the remaining portion of the leaves that are still sticking out together and then continue to wrap around the pyramid.  Holding the pyramid tightly with one hand, use the other hand to wrap the twine around the middle a couple of times and then tie it off tightly.  Leave it hanging from the twine and wrap the rest of the zongzi.Bring a large pot of water to a boil and submerge the zong zi.  Continue to cook for an hour, until the sticky rice is cooked through.  Drain and let the zong zi cool before unwrapping to eat, discarding the leaf.  Serve with sweet chili sauce and/or soy paste.  These freeze very well, just microwave to reheat!*See my tips above for variations.Next: Strawberry

{"title": "Candied Carrot Rose Tart", "date": "Thursday, February 1, 2018", "text": "When I first found out that the ingredient for this season's collaboration was carrots, my heart sank.  Because, you guys, I hate carrots.  Always have, always will.  I'll eat them if I have to, but I would never go out of my way to make a recipe spotlighting them.  But the more I thought about it, the more I decided:  challenge accepted!At first I thought about doing some sort of carrot cake, because that's the only way I like carrots--when I can't taste them.  But then I decided I could push the envelope a little farther and came up with this tart, which is basically a deconstructed carrot cake, cream cheese frosting and all!I used Dorie Greenspan's spiced tart dough from her book Baking:  From My Home to Yours, the cookbook the Food52 Baking Club is going through this month.  It works well for this tart because it has the nuts, cinnamon, and cloves traditionally found in carrot cake.  The filling is just a simple mix of cream cheese, sour cream, and sugar.But the candied carrot roses is probably what you want to know about.  I got that idea from Stella Park's Bravetart cookbook when the Food52 Baking Club went through that book a couple of months ago.  She covers the technique on Serious Eats and her own blog, so I didn't bother taking pictures myself (plus, sticky hands + taking pictures = not good).In order to make sure that I made enough roses to cover the top of the tart, I found a plate that was about the same size as the tart and kept making the roses until the plate was covered.  It took me a little less than 6 large carrots to get there, including a bunch of ribbons that were too short.  And I had to candy all the carrot strips in 3 batches since they wouldn't all fit into the syrup at once.  If you want some extra shine/sweetness, you could brush some of the leftover poaching syrup onto the roses just before serving.Candied Carrot Rose Tartmakes 1 tartYour favorite tart shell, fully baked and cooled8 oz. cream cheese, softened1/4 cup sour cream1 1/2 cup sugar, dividedJuice from half a lemon1 cup water1/2 a cinnamon stick6 long, thick carrotsUse the paddle attachment in a stand up mixer or hand mixer to combine the cream cheese, sour cream, and 1/2 cup of sugar.  Spread into the tart shell and chill while you make the carrot roses.Combine the remaining 1 cup of sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon stick, and water in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil and then lower the heat to a simmer.Cut off the carrot tops and peel.  Then, using the vegetable peeler, peel the carrots into long, thick strips.Once all the sugar has dissolved in the syrup, add a third of the carrot strips.  Cook for about a minute, then turn off the heat and allow the strips to cool in the syrup.Pick up one of the strips and squeegee the excess syrup off with your fingers.  Hold the thinner end with one hand and start twirling the rest of the carrot strip around it to form a rose.  Tuck the end underneath and set it down on a plate about the size of your tart pan.  Repeat with remaining strips until you have enough to cover the plate, and thus, the top of your tart.Carefully transfer the carrot roses to the tart and return to the fridge until ready to serve.Check out the rest of the bloggers who participated in the #24carrotgoals collaboration below:Square

{"title": "My Mom's Steamed Bao Buns", "date": "Wednesday, December 6, 2017", "text": "I first wrote up my mom's hua juan recipe almost 9 years ago so I figured it's time to give a little update.  You can use this recipe to make regular steamed mantou, or fill them to make different types of baozi, but my favorite is still hua juan, which is just the regular bao dough with a sesame-scallion glaze twisted into a flower shape.I recently came across this new way to shape bread called a Winston knot.  There aren't many videos of how to make it online, and the one I used wasn't even that good, but once you get the idea it's pretty easy.  You can make it with two single strips or two double strips like I did here.  I think the most popular one I've seen is with two triple strips; the resulting bun looks like a volleyball!The first step is to make an X with the strips.Then you'll cross one half of the bottom strip over.Now take the strip that's on the bottom of this picture and weave it through the other 3 strips.Continue taking the strip on the bottom (or on the right after rotating 90 degrees) and weaving it through the other 3 strips.When you run out of dough to weave, smush the ends all together.Then roll the braid up into a ball with the smushed end on the inside.That's it!  For these buns I decided to apply the sesame-scallion glaze only on the inside of the bun so the outside would stay immaculately white.My Mom's Steamed Bao Bunsmakes 12 bunsA heaping teaspoon of active dry yeast1 cup milk, warmed to 100-110°F3 cups all-purpose flour6 tablespoons of sugar1/4 cup vegetable oilTurn the oven on to the lowest setting (mine is 170°F).Dissolve the yeast in the warm milk.  If you don't have a thermometer, the milk should feel a little warmer than a fever.Combine the flour and sugar, then add the milk mixture and oil.  Mix together until a dough forms and knead a few minutes until smooth.  Cover the bowl and place in the oven.  Turn off the heat and let the dough proof for an hour or until doubled.Once the dough has doubled, remove from the oven and turn the oven on again to the lowest setting.  Punch the dough down and knead a few more times.  Divide into twelve equal pieces (I divide in half twice and then divide each quarter into thirds).  Shape and fill the dough at this point if desired.  Place each bun on a square of parchment paper.  Cover and place in the oven, turning off the oven again.  Let proof another 40-60 minutes.Steam the buns for 13 minutes.  I use my stockpot with the pasta insert as one level and the steamer insert as a second level so I can steam 6 at a time.If not eating immediately, freeze and reheat in the microwave before eating.Next:  Pork, Cabbage, and Tofu DumplingsPreviously: Slow-Roasted Ginger Scallion SalmonLast Year:  Cranberry Curd TartThree Years Ago:  Puppy Chow PieFour Years Ago:  Thai Coconut Sticky Rice with MangoFive Years Ago:  Vanilla Passion CaramelsEight Years Ago:  Wah Guay (Taiwanese Rice Cake with Meat Sauce)Nine Years Ago:  Beef Noodle Soup and Lu Dan"},
{"title": "Slow-Roasted Ginger Scallion Salmon", "date": "Thursday, November 30, 2017", "text": "I was first introduced to slow-roasted salmon when the Food52 Cookbook Club was going through Samin Nosrat's Salt Fat Acid Heat back in September.  I tried the citrus version with lemon vinaigrette first and was absolutely smitten.  As incredible as the citrus and vinaigrette were, I think it was the salt and slow-roasting that made the dish truly exceptional.  It made a regular farm-raised salmon filet taste like a wild-caught Copper River King salmon!  The salmon was moist, rich, and buttery without being slimy or fishy.  I also tried her soy-glazed version, and it turned out amazing as well, but having to baste the fillet every 15 minutes was kind of too fussy for me.I decided I needed to combine the recipe for Grace's ginger scallion fish with this method of cooking salmon and found some friends who were interested in testing out the recipe.  I also found some friends who had poor reading comprehension and thought I was offering them free food, haha.We tested roasting the salmon with the skin side up, down, and skinless, and I found that skin side down worked the best.  The skin shielded the fish from too much heat from below, and this version produced the least dry fillet.  The skin never really gets crispy, though, so unless you enjoy rubbery skin, I wouldn't serve that part.Also, the reason I wrote that the salmon should be straight from the fridge is because some people were using frozen salmon which they let thaw on their counter before using.  Their salmon came out overdone in the time frame I gave so, if you are also making this with warmer-than-refrigerator salmon, reduce the time in the oven accordingly.Slow-Roasted Ginger Scallion Salmon1 lb. salmon fillet, straight from the fridge2 tablespoons sugar4 tablespoons soy sauce2 tablespoons rice wine (if you don't have any, just use more water)2 tablespoons water1 bunch scallions (about 6 oz.), green parts only1-2 inch knob of fresh ginger, thinly slicedKosher saltVegetable oilPreheat the oven to 225°F.Combine the sugar, soy sauce, rice wine, and water and heat for 1 minutes in the microwave.  Stir to dissolve the sugar.Line a small baking dish with the scallions and ginger and place salmon on top, skin side down.  Season the salmon liberally with kosher salt and coat with oil.  Pour the soy sauce mixture over the fish and roast the salmon for about 40-50 minutes, or until a thermometer stuck into the thickest part reads 110-120°F.The fish should still look a lot like how it did when it went in (i.e. almost translucent), so if you don't have a thermometer, check for doneness by poking the thickest part; it will start to flake once it is ready.Serve with rice and spoon some of the sauce on top for extra saucy goodness.Next:  My Mom's Steamed Bao BunsPreviously:  Deep Fried Apple Dumplings with Miso Caramel Dipping SauceLast Year:  Pear Apple Cranberry Slab PieTwo Years Ago:  Pad ThaiThree Years Ago:  Raindrop CakeFour Years Ago:  My Mom's Taiwanese Sticky RiceFive Years Ago:  Grapefruit PieEight Years Ago:  Nanaimo BarsNine Years Ago:  Homemade Crystallized Ginger"},
{"title": "Deep Fried Apple Dumplings with Miso Caramel Dipping Sauce", "date": "Saturday, October 21, 2017", "text": "You know how sometimes something is really, really hyped up and you're just like, \"uh huh, okay, but it can't actually be that amazing.\"  Well, I just wanted to let you know that miso caramel is *actually* that amazing!  I first heard about it on Food52, but then I noticed that some of my favorite food bloggers were also incorporating it into their apple pies and raving about it.  It is rather rich and strong so it might not be for everyone, but if you like salted caramel and miso, you'll probably love this caramel too.  The best way I can describe it is \"flavor bomb\".  Try it on ice cream, in apple pies, with apple slices, or just straight out of the jar!The reason I even decided to make miso caramel is because I was invited by Rebecca and Ruth from Square Meal Round Table to join a fall collaboration with a bunch of other Instagrammers/food bloggers centered around the prompt #Aisforalltheapples.  I had the idea to make apple dumplings, but not the American baked kind using pastry dough; I wanted to make them with Hong Kong style dumpling skins and shape them like pot stickers.  Get it?  Instead of pan-frying them, though, I was going to deep fry them like McDonald's used to fry their apple pies!  And I figured to continue with the Asian twist, I'd pair the apple dumplings with miso caramel sauce.When it came time to shape the dumplings, I decided to go a little crazy with the pleating since I knew I wasn't making that many, but it's entirely unnecessary to do that many pleats.  In fact, I also experimented with making a couple that were just folded in half, sealed, and then crimped with a fork so that the looked like little hand pies (see above).  This shape was actually the easiest to fry evenly and dip in the caramel, so I'd probably make them this way in the future, unless I specifically wanted the pot sticker shape.Deep Fried Apple Dumplingsmakes about 2 dozen2 apples (I used gala but fuji or pink lady would work too)3 tablespoons brown sugar, packed1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon1/4 teaspoon cornstarchPinch of saltDumpling skinsOil for fryingPeel the apples and finely dice.  Mix with the brown sugar, cinnamon, cornstarch, and salt in a small saucepan.  Heat over medium-low heat for about 5 minutes, until the apples are tender and liquid starts to form.  Transfer to a bowl and allow to cool to room temperature.Wet the edges of the dumpling skins and fill with the apple mixture.  Seal tightly.Heat the oil in a pot to 350°F.  Fry the dumplings until golden brown and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.  Serve immediately with the miso caramel dipping sauce (recipe below).Miso Caramel Dipping Sauce (from Minxeats via Food52)makes 1 pint3/4 cup granulated sugar1/4 cup water1/2 cup heavy cream2 tablespoons white misoHeat the sugar and water over medium-high heat in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil and continue to cook without stirring until it turns a medium amber and wisps of smoke just start to appear.  Immediately remove from heat and whisk in the heavy cream.  If the caramel seizes,

{"title": "Crane Rangoons", "date": "Monday, October 16, 2017", "text": "I've been toying with the idea to make these ever since I saw an article on Food52 about someone who folded wonton skins into origami cranes and deep fried them.  Naturally the only logical progression would be to stuff them with cream cheese and make crane rangoons, right?My mom taught me how to fold paper cranes when I was a kid, and it's basically muscle memory for me, but if you're not familiar with how to fold a crane you'll definitely want to practice with paper first.  One thing I realized as I was doing research for this post is that the way my mom taught me how to fold a paper crane is different than the most popular way on the internet.  In fact, I can't seem to find a single tutorial showing the method my mom taught me!  It's a very disorienting feeling to realize that something that you thought everyone else knew is actually just something only your family knows.Anyways, for science, I tried both ways with a wonton skin, and there doesn't seem to be too much of a difference.  I think the hollow space in the crane's body may be a tad larger using my mom's method, and the tail and head are a bit fatter so it's a little easier to have a defined head.  Both honestly, I'm not sure those differences are a big enough of a deal to learn a new way to fold a crane, especially since it's hard enough folding one with a wonton skin.You will want to get the freshest, most pliable wonton skins you can find, and the thinner the better.  The ones I used weren't a perfect square, but you can still get a pretty decent looking crane.  Also, instead of making perfect creases like you'd usually do with paper, you want to try not to press down too hard on any folds so that the wonton skin doesn't break.After I finished folding the cranes, I microwaved them for 8-10 seconds, just enough to make them a little stiffer, but not totally cooked.  Basically I watched them as they microwaved and pulled them out as soon as they started to distort.  At that point, I was still able to manipulate them back into the desired shape.Then I whipped up some softened cream cheese with some chopped scallions and a pinch or two of salt.  To fill the cranes, I used a piping bag with a no. 12 round tip.  A slightly smaller tip would probably have been a little better, but you don't want to use a tiny one or else the scallions might get stuck in the tip.I deep fried the crane rangoons in 375°F oil until they were golden brown.  After some trial and error, it seemed like frying them upside down was the best way to get them to cook as evenly as possible.  When they were done, I let them drain on a paper towel-lined plate.Next:  Deep Fried Apple Dumplings with Miso Caramel Dipping SaucePreviously:  Blueberry Salted Caramel Ice Cream with Chocolate FrecklesLast Year:  Soy Garlic Glazed Korean Fried CauliflowerTwo Years Ago:  Mini Homemade Pretzel DogsThree Years Ago:  Elote-Style Cornbread WafflesFour Years Ago:  Apple Cider DonutsFive Years Ago:  Magical Cold Brew Coffee"},
{"title": "Blueberry Salted Caramel Ice Cream with Chocolate Freckles", "date": "Tuesday, September 12, 2017", "text": "My friend Christine and I have been making a day trip to Portland, ME every summer for the last couple of years and basically spend the day stuffing ourselves.  We always go to Eventide Oysters for my favorite lobster rolls, The Holy Donut for potato donuts, Duckfat for their fries, and Gelato Fiasco for ice cream (the honeycomb ice cream sundae from Honeypaw has made it onto our itinerary for the last 2 years as well).  My favorite flavor is the Maine Wild Blueberry Caramel Sea Salt Stracciatella gelato, but they didn't have it this year so I had to settle for the Blueberry Milk and Cookies flavor which was still really good.So when Boston Organics contacted me and offered to send me a 5 lb. box of their wild Maine blueberries, I knew the first thing I wanted to make with them.  I consulted with my favorite ice cream cookbook, Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home, and realized I could make something similar using her salty caramel ice cream recipe, adding some blueberry compote, and then swirling in some chocolate freckles when the ice cream was almost done churning.I also wanted to share some more information about these wonderful blueberries because they're so different from the ones you usually find in the grocery store.  These are from Burke Hill Farm in Cherryfield, ME and come in a compact wax box that will fit perfectly in most freezers.  Known as lowbush blueberries, these wild blueberries grow in northern New England’s naturally acidic soil and are resilient enough to withstand the region's icy winters.  They're smaller and sweeter than the highbush berries you're probably used to, and perfect for freezing, baking, and just snacking on!  You can find more information here on the Boston Organics website.I wish the ice cream could be as brilliantly colored as the blueberry milk and cookies gelato above, but I was worried that adding too much blueberry compote to the ice cream base might make it too icy.  Regardless, the flavor is incredible; the sweetness of the caramel is tempered by the tartness of the blueberries, and the crackly dark chocolate freckles adds a fun textural component. Blueberry Salted Caramel Ice Cream with Chocolate Frecklesmakes about 1 quart1 cup wild Maine blueberries (frozen is fine)*2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar2 cups whole milk1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch3 tablespoons cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon kosher salt1 1/4 cups heavy cream2 tablespoons light corn syrup2 teaspoons vanilla extract4 oz. dark chocolate, choppedHeat the blueberries and 2 tablespoons of sugar in a small saucepan until it comes to a boil.  Gently mash the blueberries and remove from heat.Mix a couple tablespoons of the milk with the cornstarch to make a slurry and set aside.  Whisk the cream cheese and kosher salt in a large bowl and set aside.  Mix the heavy cream and corn syrup in a measuring cup with a spout.Add the remaining 2/3 cup of sugar to a 4-quart saucepan and heat over medium heat.  Wait until a layer of sugar has melted and turned amber before stirring with a heatproof spatula.  Once all the sugar has melted and is a dark amber remove from heat and add about 1/4 cup of the heavy cream mixture while stirring.  It will violently erupt with steam so be careful!  Continue to stir and add more and more of the cream until it is all incorporated. Return the pan to medium-high heat and add the rest of the milk.  Bring to a boil and cook for 4 minutes.  Whisk in the cornstarch slurry and bring back to a boil.  Continue to cook and stir until slightly thickened, about one minute.Add a little of the hot cream mixture to the cream cheese and whisk until the cream cheese is dissolved.  Add the rest of the cream mixture, vanilla, and blueberry compote and mix.  Chill the mixture, then churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.While the ice cream is churning, place the chopped chocolate in a plastic sandwich bag, seal it shut, and then place in some very hot water.  Occasionally squeeze the chocolate around until it is all melted.  Remove the bag from the water and dry the outside.  Keep the chocolate melted but not hot.Once the ice cream is almost done churning, snip a corner off of the sandwich bag and squeeze a steady stream of the melted chocolate into the ice cream while it continues to churn.  Pack the churned ice cream into a storage container and freeze for at least 4 hours.*If you can't get your hands on wild Maine blueberries, you can use regular blueberries to make the compote, but you may want to boil it longer to reduce it further and add some more sugar as needed.Next:  Crane RangoonsPreviously:  Greyscale Cream PuffsLast Year:  Macau-Style Portuguese Chicken RiceThree Years Ago:  Taiwanese Taro Swirl MooncakesFour Years Ago:  Ramen Lobster RollsFive Years Ago:  Caramelized Onion and Swiss Chard Quiche"},

{"title": "Rhubarb Strawberry Coconut Cream Tart", "date": "Monday, April 24, 2017", "text": "Ever since I attempted the herringbone lattice pie crust a few months ago, I've been wanting another shot at getting it right.  So when I saw rhubarb being sold at my local grocery story, I figured I'd try to make a tart and top it with a herringbone lattice made of poached rhubarb strips!When buying the rhubarb for this, try to get ones of equal width so the lattice will look nice and neat.  I pretty much followed the instructions for poaching the rhubarb from Baking a Moment's beautiful post on making a rhubarb tart with a (regular) lattice top.  Instead of using a mandolin, I used my vegetable peeler which, honestly, was a labor of love.  I probably had to ditch a third of my attempts at getting nice long thin ribbons.  Luckily, I bought a couple more rhubarbs that I thought I'd need exactly for this reason.For the tart crust, I used the recipe for a sweet tart crust from Mark Bittman's How to Bake Everything.  I also followed his suggestion to use sweetened whipped coconut cream as the base.  I originally wasn't going to add the layer of strawberries, but my friends Celine and Alex were over this weekend and left me some beautiful strawberries.  I'm so glad I added them because they have a natural sweet-tartness which perfectly complements the flavor of the rhubarb.  The nice thing about this recipe is that if you use a vegan and/or gluten-free tart crust, the rest of the pie is also vegan and gluten-free!Rhubarb Strawberry Coconut Cream Tartmakes a 9\" tartYour favorite 9\" sweet tart crust, blind baked and cooled14 oz. can of coconut milk, refrigerated overnight3 tablespoons powdered sugar1 tablespoon vanilla extract1 cup sliced strawberries6-8 rhubarb stalks of equal width1/2 cup sugarBefore you fit the tart dough into your tart pan, remove the bottom and trace it on a large piece of parchment paper.  Then proceed to line the pan with the dough, chill, and blind bake until golden brown all over.Place the can of coconut milk, a large bowl, and the metal beaters of your electric beater in the fridge overnight.  The next morning, open the can and spoon out the solid white coconut cream into the chilled bowl.  You can discard the leftover liquid or save it to add to smoothies or overnight oats.  Add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract to the bowl and use the chilled beaters to beat the cream until it is light and fluffy.  Spread it evenly across the bottom of the tart crust and chill in the refrigerator while you wash and slice the strawberries.Arrange the strawberries on top of the coconut cream in an even layer.  Cover and return to the fridge to chill while you prepare the rhubarb.Use a vegetable peeler or mandolin to peel long, thin strips from the rhubarb stalks.  Roughly chop any leftover red parts and add to a large pot along with any leftover strawberry pieces.  Add a cup of water and the sugar and bring to a simmer.Prepare a rimmed baking sheet with a couple layers of paper towels.  Poach the strips of rhubarb in batches for about a minute or so until softened.  Remove with a slotted spoon to the paper towels to drain.  Reserve the poaching liquid.Use the parchment paper with the outline of the tart pan to lay out half the rhubarb strips vertically.  Then, fold the first strip halfway down, skip 3, then fold down the next 3, and skip the next 3, following this pattern until you reach the end. Lay a long strip down horizontally across the middle, then, leaving the 1st vertical strip folded over, fold down the 2nd vertical strip over the horizontal strip you just laid down, skip the next 2, fold the 5th strip back up, leave the next 2 as is, and fold down the one after that, etc.  Lay another strip down horizontally above the first one you laid down.  Continue to repeat this pattern until you've covered the outlined 9\" circle.  This post from Serious Eats is also a great resource (with pictures!) on how to create the herringbone lattice top.  You can also just do a plain checkered lattice crust which would still look very nice.Remove the tart from the fridge and carefully flip the woven rhubarb lattice onto the tart (it will seem quite scary but because the strips are still wet, they will adhere to the parchment paper pretty well).  Peel the parchment paper away and re-adjust the lattice as needed.  Use a sharp pair of kitchen shears or paring knife to cut away any extra rhubarb.  Brush some of the poaching liquid on top, being careful not to disturb the herringbone pattern.  Chill until ready to serve.Next:  3-28 Slab PiePreviously:  Rainbow Crepe CakeLast Year:  Will It Puffle?Two Years Ago:  Gordon Ramsay's Sublime Scrambled Eggs - Two WaysThree Years Ago:  Nutella Mini Crepe CakesSeven Years Ago:  The Best Scones in the WorldEight Years Ago:  Bacon and Egg Bunny Buns"},
{"title": "Rainbow Crepe Cake", "date": "Friday, March 10, 2017", "text": "I've been wanting to try making a full-size crepe cake ever since I made those Nutelle mini crepe cakes 3 years ago, and seeing a recent picture of my friend Serene's matcha crepe cake re-inspired me.  But when I couldn't decide which flavor crepe cake to make, my other friend Christine reminded me of a rainbow crepe cake she had shown me on Instagram before.  I knew what I must do.After some research on-line, it seemed that most rainbow crepe cakes used 6 discrete colors of crepes, but I wanted to try to blend them together so that the color of the crepes was more progressive.  I figured I'd make 2 crepes of each color, then start mixing the leftover batter together a little at a time.  This just made an already complicated process even more complicated, but I'm rather pleased with the result.  If you'd rather just leave it as 6 discrete colors, just divide the batter evenly between 6 bowls before coloring.  But if you'd like to try the ombré approach, you can put 1/3 less batter in the bowls for the red and purple since you're only blending those one way instead of two (a scale makes it a lot easier to figure out).I decided to just use sweetened whipped cream for the filling (a recommendation from Serene) instead of pastry cream plus whipped cream like a lot of other recipes use because it was easier, and I liked the pure white color of the filling against the rainbow of colors.  Serene also suggested freezing the cake if not serving right away to help stabilize it and prevent weeping. Rainbow Crepe Cake (crepe recipe from Alton Brown)makes a 24-layer crepe cake4 large eggs1 1/2 cup milk1 cup water2 cups all-purpose flour5 tablespoons sugar6 tablespoons melted butter1 tablespooon vanilla extract, dividedOil, for greasing2 cups heavy cream1/3 cup powdered sugarRainbow sprinkles (optional)Combine the eggs, milk, water, flour, sugar, butter, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract in a blender and pulse for 10 seconds.  Let rest in the fridge for at least an hour or overnight.Divide the batter into 6 bowls, with about 1/3 less in two of the bowls.  Color the bowls with less batter in them red and purple.  Color the other bowls orange, yellow, green, and blue.Lightly grease a non-stick pan with oil and heat over medium-low.  Pour a scant 1/4 cup of the purple batter into the middle of the pan and swirl to spread into an even circle.  Cook for 30 seconds and flip carefully.  Cook for another 10 seconds, then transfer to a cutting board or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Repeat, making 2 crepes each of all 6 colors.  Once the crepes have cooled on the parchment paper you can start stacking them on a plate.Gradually mix the rainbow-adjacent colors together to make the rest of the crepes.  You should end up with about 24 crepes, more if you don't mess any up.  I messed up 2 or 3 (the first one is always a fail) and ended up with 24.Beat the heavy cream to soft peaks, then add the powdered sugar and remaining teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Beat again to barely stiff peaks. Place a purple crepe on a plate and spread a thin layer of the whipped cream on top, leaving a little bit of a border.  Top with another crepe and continue with alternating layers of crepes and whipped cream. If you have any whipped cream leftover, frost the top and garnish with sprinkles, if you like.  Chill until ready to serve.To be honest, I thought the cake looked a lot prettier than it tasted.  This happened the last time I made a rainbow confection too.  I think I was so focused on the looks I forgot that I never really flavored the crepes or whipped cream, and Alton Brown's crepes are made to be filled with something tasty not just eaten alone.  Luckily, Serene sent me her crepe recipe so I'll probably use that one next time.  =)Next:  Rhubarb Strawberry Coconut Cream TartPreviously:  Japanese Chicken Curry RiceLast Year:  The 4-Hour BaguetteTwo Years Ago:  Homemade Squid Ink PastaThree Years Ago:  Miso-Glazed EggplantFour Years Ago:  Happiness CakeSeven Years Ago:  Momofuku's Crack PieEight Years Ago:  Korean Pancake Face-Off"},

In the meantime, make the curry roux by melting the butter in a small pan over medium-low heat.  Add the flour and stir until the roux starts to get darker, about 5-10 minutes.  Mix in the garam masala and curry powder and take off the heat once combined.When the potatoes are done, add some of the hot liquid to the roux and whisk until the roux is loose, adding more liquid as necessary.  Add back to the pot and bring back to a boil.  Stir in the soy sauce and ketchup.  Taste, and add the honey if you'd prefer it sweeter.  Simmer until the curry has thickened.  Serve with cooked rice.Next:  Rainbow Crepe CakePreviously:  Quintessential Apple Pie with Bacon Fat CrustLast Year:  Tropical Pulled Pork on Griddled Banana Bread SandwichesTwo Years Ago:  A Better Homemade Pasta RecipeThree Years Ago:  Mushroom Marsala PizzaFour Years Ago:  Peking Duck PizzaSeven Years Ago:  Bacon Fat CaramelsEight Years Ago:  Potato Leek Soup with Bacon"},
{"title": "Quintessential Apple Pie with Bacon Fat Crust", "date": "Wednesday, February 22, 2017", "text": "Food52 started its cookbook club this month, and the inaugural cookbook was Kate McDermott's Art of the Pie!  I thought it was an interesting choice because it's the dead of winter here in New England, and I usually think of the summer and fall as better pie-making seasons.  But I was able to get a copy of the book from the library so I figured I'd take a look and see what might inspire me.The first pie I tried was the Banana Rum Caramel Coconut Pie because, while there were several components to the pie--a blind baked pie crust, bananas, rum caramel, rum pastry cream, and toasted coconut chips--I actually already had all the ingredients!  Personally, I thought the pie was too sweet, but it didn't stop me from trying a couple more pies from the book. Since I had a bunch of egg whites leftover from rum pastry cream for the previous pie, I decided to try my first lemon meringue pie.  While the pie tasted great, I had issues with the meringue weeping even after following all the directions from the book.  I was also a little confused with the direction to \"pull up some soft peaks with the handle of a spoon\".  I got little itty-bitty peaks whereas I would've preferred larger waves.  If I ever make a meringue pie again, I'll probably just use a spatula to do that.My favorite pie that I made from the book was the Quintessential Apple Pie.  Kate's preferred pie crust is one made with butter and leaf lard, but since I didn't feel like sourcing any leaf lard, I turned to what I already had in my freezer:  bacon fat.  It was definitely more malleable than the butter even when chilled, but I think it made for a wonderfully flaky pie crust with a subtle bacon flavor.For the filling Kate suggests using a mix of sweet and tart apples, so I used a blend of Gala, Fuji, Golden Delicious, Macintosh, Cortland, and Red Delicious apples.  She also wrote that you don't need to peel the apples if the skins are pretty thin, so I nixed that time-consuming step.  She was right; the inclusion of the apple peels didn't really make a difference in the texture of the cooked filling and may have even improved the taste with their tannins.And since I've been eyeing Serious Eats' herringbone lattice crust for a while now, I decided to try it on top of this pie.  It was actually my first time making any sort of lattice pie crust!  I was pretty pleased with the result even though I did mess up the pattern.  Because you want the filling to be quite flat before laying the herringbone lattice on top, I decided to pre-cook the apple pie filling which reduces the volume ahead of time and prevents the dreaded gaping hole between the top crust and filling after baking.Quintessential Apple Pie with Bacon Fat Crust (adapted from Art of the Pie)makes 1 pieFor the pie crust:1/2 cup rendered bacon fat1/2 cup unsalted butter2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour1/2 teaspoon kosher salt1/2 cup ice waterCut the bacon fat and butter into tablespoon-size pieces.  Place the bacon fat, butter, flour, and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse 15 times.Add 1/4 cup of the ice water and pulse 10 more times.  Add the remaining 1/4 cup of ice water and pulse 5 more times.  Dump the contents into another bowl and use chilled hands to bring the dough together.  Divide the dough in half and place half in the fridge.Place the other half on a floured surface and cover with plastic wrap.  Roll the dough out to 1/16\" thickness and an inch or two larger than your pie pan.  Carefully transfer to the pie pan, trim the edges, cover, and let chill in the refrigerator.  Add the excess trimmings to the other half of the pie dough that was already chilling in the fridge.For the filling:10 cups of apples, preferably a mix of tart and sweet ones with thin skins1/2 cup sugar1/2 teaspoon kosher salt2 gratings of nutmeg1/2 teaspoon allspice1 tablespoon artisan apple cider vinegar1/2 cup flour2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces1 egg white (for the egg wash)Leaving the skins on, slice the apples and mix with the sugar, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.  Cook in a large pan over medium-low for about 15 minutes, just until the juices start to flow.  Toss with the vinegar and flour and let cool completely before filling the pie shell.  Dot the top of the apples with the small pieces of butter.If you want to do the herringbone lattice, follow the directions from Serious Eats.  Otherwise, roll out the other half of the dough and top the pie, cutting a few vents on top.  Trim the excess dough and crimp the edges.  Cover the pie and let it chill in the fridge while you preheat the oven to 425°F.Mix the egg white with 1 tablespoon of water and brush on top of the pie.  Bake for 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375°F and bake for another 40 minutes.  Cool the pie for at least an hour before serving.Next:  Japanese Chicken Curry RicePreviously:  French Onion Tater TotchosTwo Years Ago:  Hugo & Victor's Pink Grapefruit TartThree Years Ago:  OkonomiyakiFour Years Ago:  Cauliflower Steak with Cauliflower PureeSeven Years Ago:  Bacon Caramel CornEight Years Ago:  Wok-Fried Edamame with Garlic"},

{"title": "Salted Egg Yolk Mochi Ice Cream", "date": "Monday, January 30, 2017", "text": "Earlier last year I discovered a new kind of steamed bun, the liu sha bao.  I think translated directly it means \"quicksand bun\" but it's actually a lot better tasting that it sounds.  Inside is a molten filling made of salted egg yolk custard, and I could probably eat 5 of them in a row.  I tried making some a few weeks ago, but the result was just okay and not really worth all the work when I can just get the perfected bun at dim sum.Because of that experiment I still had 3 cooked salted duck eggs sitting in my fridge, though, so I figured I'd try to make an ice cream out of them.  I followed the template of Jeni's Salty Vanilla Frozen Custard, but I replaced 3 of the raw egg yolks with 3 cooked salted duck egg yolks, which you can find in the egg section of a Chinese grocery store.  I reduced the salt a little because the egg yolks were already salted and added a little bit of turmeric to increase the yellow coloring of the ice cream.  It still comes out a rather pale yellow, but I didn't want to add any artificial food coloring.The resulting ice cream is incredibly rich, and tastes pretty much like the inside of a liu sha bao but in ice cream form.  So I decided to try making it into mochi ice cream to continue down that path.  I've tried making mochi ice cream before and that attempt was disastrous, to say the least, so this time I made sure to follow a trusted recipe.  I'm happy to say that the one from Just One Cookbook worked marvelously.  These salted egg yolk mochi ice creams are perfect because you only need a couple of bites of the ice cream, and the soft, chewy mochi helps keep the intense flavor from being too overwhelming.  Plus, I think they look super cute and remind me of liu sha bao!Salted Egg Yolk Ice Cream (adapted from Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream Desserts)makes about 1 quart3 cooked salted duck eggs2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon kosher salt1/8 teaspoon turmeric2 3/4 cups whole milk3 large raw egg yolks1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons cornstarch1 cup heavy cream3/4 cup sugar2 tablespoons light corn syrupCarefully crack and peel the salted duck eggs, removing the whites until you are left with only the egg yolks.  Mash the egg yolks in a medium bowl, then add the cream cheese, salt, and turmeric and whisk until smooth.Mix about 2 tablespoons of the milk, the raw egg yolks, and cornstarch in a small bowl and set aside.  Fill a large bowl with ice and water.Combine the remaining milk, the cream, sugar, and corn syrup in a 4-quart saucepan, bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and boil for 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and gradually add about 2 cups of the hot milk mixture to the egg yolk mixture, one ladleful at a time, stirring well after each addition. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring constantly with a heatproof spatula, just until the mixture thickens. Remove from the heat and strain through a sieve if necessary.Gradually whisk the hot milk mixture into the cream cheese mixture until smooth. Pour the mixture into a 1-gallon Ziploc freezer bag and submerge the sealed bag in the ice bath. Let stand, adding more ice as necessary, until cold, about 30 minutes.Remove the frozen canister from the freezer, assemble your ice cream machine, and turn it on. Pour the custard base into the canister and spin until thick and creamy.Pack the custard into a storage container. Press a sheet of parchment directly against the surface and seal with an airtight lid.

When ready to eat, let sit at room temperature for a few minutes so that the mochi can soften.Next:  French Onion Tater TotchosPreviously:  Marion Cunningham's Yeast-Raised WafflesTwo Years Ago:  San Bei (Taiwanese Three Cup) Tofu and RamenThree Years Ago:  Grilled Cheese Egg in a HoleFour Years Ago:  Homemade BagelsSeven Years Ago:  Sweet Potato Gnocchi with Maple Cinnamon Sage Brown ButterEight Years Ago:  Dutch Babies"},

This year I decided to follow this tried-and-true recipe for chocolate babka from Smitten Kitchen.  The only change I made to the ingredients is that I used the zest from a whole orange instead of half an orange, and the smells that came out of my oven were glorious.  I also tried shaping it using what I remembered from the pictures in the Baking Breads cookbook.Since the recipe makes two loaves, I decided to give one of the loaves the \"pull-apart swirly bread\" treatment.  If you'd like to try it, roll out a quarter of the dough (half a loaf) into a rectangle about 10\" wide and as long as you can get it.  Spread with 1/4 of the filling and roll it up along the long edge.  Seal the seam and place in the freezer for 15 minutes while you repeat the same with the other quarter of dough.  Slice each log into 8 pieces, and arrange all 16 pieces in a well-greased 9\" springform or square pan.  Let rise for an hour and then bake for 25-30 minutes at 375°F until nicely browned.  Brush with syrup and serve.Chocolate Babka (based on Smitten Kitchen)makes 2 loavesFor the dough:1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast1/2 cup warm water (about 100 F)4 1/4 cups all-purpose flour1/2 cup sugar1 teaspoon kosher saltZest from 1 orange3 large eggs11 tablespoons unsalted butter, softenedFor the filling:3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips1/2 cup unsalted butter1/2 cup powdered sugar1/3 cup cocoa powder1/4 teaspoon cinnamonFor the syrup:1/3 cup water6 tablespoons sugarSprinkle the yeast over the warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer and let sit while you measure out the rest of the ingredients.  Add all the ingredients for the dough except the butter and mix with a dough hook until it comes together.  Add the butter, one tablespoon at a time, until it is all incorporated.  Knead on medium until the dough is completely smooth and comes away from the bowl.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.The next morning, make the filling by melting the chocolate chips and butter together, stirring until smooth.  Add the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and cinnamon and stir until it forms a spreadable paste.  Grease 2 loaf pans and line with parchment paper.Remove half the dough from the refrigerator and roll out on a floured surface until 10\" wide on the bottom and as long as you can get it.  Spread the filling on top, leaving an inch border on all sides except the bottom.  Roll up the dough in a tight spiral starting from the bottom.  Wet the top edge and seal together.  Wrap with aluminum foil and place in the freezer while you work on the second half of the dough.Remove the first log from the freezer and use a sharp knife to slice in half, lengthwise, revealing all the layers of dough and chocolate filling.  Make an \"X\" with the two halves, placing the prettier half on top.  Twist the top half and bottom half and place in one of the greased pans, tucking the ends underneath.  Repeat with the second half.  Cover both and let rise another hour.  Preheat oven to 375°F.Bake loaves for 25-30 minutes, until a skewer meets no resistance when inserted and comes out without any dough (it will most likely come out with some chocolate filling which is very tempting to lick).While the babka is baking, make the syrup by combining the water and sugar in a small pot and heating until the sugar is all dissolved.  Brush the loaves with the syrup as soon as they come out of the oven.And if you manage to have any leftover babka, you can turn it into the most amazing bread pudding using this recipe from Serious Eats!  (I just added some coconut milk on top for contrast.)Next:  Marion Cunningham's Yeast-Raised WafflesPreviously:  Pull-Apart Scallion Swirly BreadTwo Years Ago:  Zuppa ToscanaThree Years Ago:  Flower PavlovasFour Years Ago:  Tartine Lemon Cream TartSeven Years Ago:  Gaufres de Liege (Belgian Waffles)Eight Years Ago:  Hua Juan"},

The bread itself reminds me a lot of milk bread in that it's slightly sweet and very soft, yet the parts that get browned turn out a little crunchy from all the butter!  And even though you just apply a small smear of the sesame-scallion filling, it's so fragrant that the flavor gets infused throughout the whole roll.  It's definitely better when warm, so if you're eating it a day or two later, microwave it for 10-20 seconds to rewarm it.Pull-Apart Scallion Swirly Bread (adapted from Breaking Breads)makes 16 rollsFor the bread dough:1 1/4 cups water1 packet (about 2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast4 cups all purpose flour1/4 cup sugar1 tablespoon kosher salt1 stick butter, very softFor the filling:1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil1/4 cup finely chopped scallions1/2 teaspoon kosher salt1/4 teaspoon sugarSprinkle the yeast over the water in a stand mixer bowl and allow to dissolve.  Mix the flour, sugar, and salt in a separate bowl, then add to the yeast and water.Use the dough hook on low to combine the ingredients, then mix on medium-high until the dough comes away from the bowl cleanly.  Give the dough a few folds to form a nice, tight ball.  Cover the bowl and let rise until almost doubled, about 30 minutes.Lightly butter a large plate (I usually use the butter wrapper to do this).  Divide the dough into 8 pieces, shape each into a tight ball, and place on the plate.  Cover and let rise for another 30 minutes.Mix the sesame oil, scallions, salt, and sugar in a small bowl.  Generously grease a 9\" springform pan with the softened butter. Use about a tablespoon of the butter to generously grease a clean 11\" x 17\" rimmed baking sheet.  Place one of the balls of dough on the baking sheet, smear a little more butter on top, and start pressing it out to cover almost the entire sheet.  Sprinkle some of the scallion filling across the middle lengthwise third of the dough.  Fold the top third of the dough down and then the bottom third up (like a business letter fold, but lengthwise).  Roll the dough up into a tight spiral and cut in half.  Place the cut sides up in the buttered pan.  Repeat with the remaining balls of dough.  Cover the bottom of the pan with a large piece of aluminum foil or place in another pan to catch any melted butter that leaks out.  Cover the pan and let the dough rise a final time for 45 minutes.Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for 15 minutes, then turn the heat down to 325°F.  Bake for another 30-40 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown.  If there is any butter left, melt it and add it to any remaining filling mixture and brush on top of the rolls.  Serve warm.Next:  Chocolate BabkaPreviously:  Cranberry Curd TartTwo Years Ago:  Puppy Chow PieThree Years Ago:  Miso Pumpkin SoupFour Years Ago:  Homemade Ramen NoodlesSeven Years Ago:  Tim Tam Slam Ice CreamEight Years Ago:  Pork and Cabbage Dumplings"},

I wish I had had this recipe for Korean fried cauliflower back then, but to be honest, this substitute is so good, I might even prefer it over the real thing.  I adapted the recipe from Serious Eats' well researched recipe and just reduced the amount of vinegar and upped the garlic in the glaze according to my own taste preferences.  If you don't have the sesame seeds and/or finely shredded coconut to add to the batter, you can omit them, but they add some great texture to the cauliflower.Even though they're meant to be an appetizer, I ended up eating them with rice like I would with sesame chicken.  And if you want to save any as leftovers, I would refrigerate the cauliflower after they're fried and drained.  The next day, heat them up in the toaster oven and then toss them with the sauce; that way they will still be crispy.Soy Garlic Glazed Korean Fried Cauliflower (adapted from Serious Eats)serves 4-6 as an appetizer or 2 as an entréeFor the Soy Garlic Glaze:1/4 cup soy sauce1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar2 tablespoons mirin6 tablespoons brown sugar1 1/2 teaspoons mince garlic1/2 teaspoon freshly grated gingerPinch of red pepper flakes1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarchCombine everything except for the cornstarch in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat.  Make a slurry with the cornstarch and 1 1/2 teaspoons water.  Whisk into sauce and bring to a boil.  Cook until the sauce is reduced and slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.

It might have been the best thing we ate that day and is definitely going on our to-eat list for future trips!I tried to recreate it at home using one of Jeni's recipes as a guide, but I wasn't able to get that pure honey flavor that was the reason I loved the original version.  But then I realized it reminded me of Toscanini's burnt caramel ice cream, which is a very, very good thing.  I also liked how the honeycomb candy--also made with one of Jeni's recipes--added a unique texture when layered in with the ice cream.Caramelized Honeycomb Ice Cream (adapted from Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home)makes about 1 quartFor the honeycomb candy:1 1/2 cups sugar1/2 cup water3 tablespoons honey1/3 cup corn syrup1 tablespoon baking sodaBring the sugar, water, honey, and corn syrup to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  When it reaches 300°F, remove from heat and stir in the baking soda.  Pour into a parchment-lined baking sheet and let cool.  Break into small pieces.  You'll only need about half the amount that this recipe makes for the ice cream, but it's great eaten on its own or coated with chocolate.  Store in an airtight container.For the ice cream:2 cups whole milk1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons cornstarch4 tablespoons cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon kosher salt2/3 cup honey1 1/2 cups heavy creamMake a slurry with the cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of the milk and set aside.  Whisk the cream cheese and salt in a medium bowl until smooth.Caramelize the honey in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Stir in about 1/4 of the cream to loosen it up and then stir in the rest of the cream.  Add the remaining milk and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Boil for 4 minutes, then whisk in the cornstarch slurry.  Bring the mixture back to a boil and cook until slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk the hot milk mixture into the cream cheese until smooth.  Chill the mixture in an ice bath or in the refrigerator until cold.Churn according to your ice cream maker's instructions.  Pack the ice cream into a storage container, mixing in the honeycomb candy as you go.  Freeze in your freezer until firm, at least 4 hours.Next:  Soy Garlic Glazed Korean Fried CauliflowerPreviously:  Macau-Style Portuguese Chicken RiceTwo Years Ago:  Ginger Scallion Lobster BunsThree Years Ago:  Ramen Lobster Rolls"},
{"title": "Macau-Style Portuguese Chicken Rice", "date": "Wednesday, September 7, 2016", "text": "I only needed one bite of the Portuguese Chicken Rice from Double Chin to know that I needed to figure out how to make it at home.  I hadn't even ordered it myself; my friend Alvin was nice enough to let a bunch of us try his, and I'm so grateful he did.  Sadly, it's not a very photogenic dish, but once you try it, you won't care. It starts with a layer of chicken fried rice topped with a mild coconut curry sauce and finished with a sprinkling of shredded cheese.  Then everything goes under the broiler until it gets all bubbly and gooey.  I know it's kind of strange to have cheese on an otherwise Asian dish, but it works so well in this case.  I think the key is to use a mild, melty cheese so that it doesn't overpower the rest of the dish.  I ended up using a mix of mozzarella and provolone.  I thought it was interesting that when I was looking for recipes on-line to use, a lot of them just listed \"shredded cheese\" as the ingredient without any reference to what kind of cheese.  Perhaps in Asia there is just one kind of shredded cheese available!I ended up referring to Lady and Pups' version because I love everything else she does, and it seemed the most similar to what I had at Double Chin.  The modifications I made were that instead of fish I used chicken and marinated it beforehand.  I used chicken breast because I prefer white meat, but feel free to use chicken thigh meat if you prefer dark meat.  I also made a couple of other modifications to her recipe based on what I had on hand (less scallions and water instead of milk) and taste preferences (half the amount of shallots).Please note that this makes quite a bit of food.  Mandy's original recipe said that it serves 2, but it would probably be more like 6 Joy-sized servings.  And if you're wondering why it's called Portuguese chicken rice, I think it has to do with the fact that Macau was a Portuguese colony up until the end of the last century.  Apparently this dish is very popular in Hong Kong cafes, and I remember seeing something similar at one of my favorite eateries in Taiwan.Macau-Style Portuguese Chicken Rice (heavily adapted from Lady and Pups)serves 4-6For the chicken:1 lb. boneless chicken, cut into 1\" pieces1 tablespoon cornstarch1 tablespoon soy sauce1 tablespoon rice wine2 tablespoons vegetable oilMix all the ingredients except for the oil and marinate for 20 minutes. Heat the oil over medium-high heat and cook the chicken until lightly brown.  Save 2/3 of it for the fried rice and finely chop the rest for the sauce.For the fried rice:2 tablespoons vegetable oil2-3 eggs, beaten3 cups day-old cooked rice, refrigerated1/2 cup chopped scallionsKosher salt and white pepper, to tasteHeat the oil over medium-high heat in a large pan and add the eggs.  Immediately add the rice and mix to coat.  Once the rice is heated through, add the scallions, salt, and white pepper to taste.  Add the reserved chicken and mix until even.  Remove from heat and set aside.For the coconut curry sauce:2 tablespoons vegetable oil1 shallot, coarsely chopped3 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped1 teaspoon ginger, grated1 tablespoon unsalted butter1 tablespoon curry powder1 tablespoon onion powder2 tablespoons finely shredded unsweetened coconut1 tablespoon all-purpose flour13.5 oz. can coconut milk1/2 cup water1 1/2 cups mix of shredded mozzarella and provolone cheese, dividedUse a small blender to puree the oil, shallot, and garlic cloves.  Mix with the grated ginger and butter and cook over medium heat in a saucepan for a few minutes until very fragrant.  Add the curry powder, onion powder, coconut, and flour continue to cook for a few more minutes to toast the spices.  Whisk in the coconut milk and water and bring to a boil.  Simmer for 5-7 minutes until thickened.  Stir in the chopped chicken and 1 cup of the cheese.Preheat the broiler.  Transfer the fried rice to a buttered casserole dish or oven safe pan.  You can also use multiple smaller dishes.  Pour the curry sauce over the rice and top with the remaining 1/2 cup of shredded cheese.  Broil for a few minutes until browned in spots and bubbly.  Serve immediately.

I wasn't really sure about having to buy the Gruyere cheese and even made it for the first time without the cheese and substituting with some minced garlic and olive oil (which, by the way, ended up being pretty darn good and worth trying if you don't eat cheese).  But then I caved in and got a small block of Gruyere.  And boy oh boy was it amazing.  Divine.  Glorious!  In the oven, the cheese melts and binds the shredded zucchini together in a holy matrimony of texture and flavor.  It's simply perfect.Zucchini Pizza (adapted from Jim Lahey by way of Smitten Kitchen)makes 1 pizza8 oz. ball of pizza dough1 medium zucchini or summer squash, about 1/2 lb.1/2 teaspoon kosher salt3 oz.

The first time I made this cake I made it in a pie pan (because I didn't have a 9\" pan) and used frozen wild blueberries.  It was quite tasty but not as pretty so I dusted it with powdered sugar as instructed in the original recipe.  When I made it this time I used a 10\" springform pan and fresh blueberries, and it looked nice enough to forgo the powdered sugar dusting. Don't worry if you think the cake batter to fruit ratio is off.  You will be spooning a lot of blueberries on top of the batter, but while the cake bakes in the oven the blueberries sink while the cake rises so it's perfect by the end.

It was my first time in Spain, and I wanted to make the most of it.  My friend Sarah Ruth (the one who taught me my favorite brownie recipe) joined me from Sweden, and we managed to hit a lot of the capital and even took a day trip to the nearby town of Segovia.  Some highlights of the trip:Eating chocolate con churros every day for breakfast!  We liked going to El Brillante for the authentic Madrileño experience and learned about purros there, which are basically, bigger, fatter churros that really remind me of Taiwanese you tiao.  We also tried them at Chocolatería San Ginés since everyone says they have the best ones, and I did like them more because they were less greasy and the hot chocolate wasn't as sweet. One of Sarah Ruth's friend's boyfriend was a local, and he was kind enough to take us around 2 of the 3 nights we were free.  I really wanted to try Madrid's specialty--bocadillo de calamares--which is basically like a fried calamari po'boy.  He took us to La Campana just off of Plaza Mayor, and the sandwich was a lot bigger than I expected!  It was pretty good, but I would've appreciated some type of sauce on there like a spicy remoulade or an aioli or something.  I bet it would be really good at 3 am after a night of partying!Another one of his suggestions was a Chinese restaurant that was located...in an underground parking garage.  I totally thought it wouldn't be worth even seeking, but then we looked on-line for it, and it seemed like the real deal.  So after more than 10 days without Asian food, I was desperate enough to try it out.  You guys, it was awesome!  It honestly tasted like something my mom would make!  To find it, go to the southeast corner of Plaza de Espana and look for the stairs that go down.  Can't miss it.We went to La Latina for tapas one night, but I was so tired we only made it to two bars . My favorite was Juana La Loca.  They had the best tortilla I had in Madrid, probably because they caramelized their onions for extra flavor.  They also had El Increible, a soft-cooked egg with truffle paste on bread.  It was amazing.  I loved that they also had some dessert options for tapas, although we didn't try any.Mercado de San Miguel is like the Fanueil Hall/Quincy Market of Madrid (super touristy food court) but it's so beautiful I can't help loving it.  They have a paella stall with four kinds of paella, and you can get a ración (single serving) instead of having to order enough for at least 2 people like every other restaurant.  I tried the paella negra which was colored with black squid ink.  The guy scraped up some of the crusty bits from the bottom of the pan so it had a nice combination of textures.There were a lot of great places to watch the sunset.  Two of mine were next to the Royal Palace and the Temple of Debod, which was moved from Egypt when the building of a dam threatened to flood it (similar to how the Met in NYC got the Temple of Dendur). After returning from Madrid, I knew I wanted to try making the iconic tortilla española at home.  I settled on Mark Bittman's recipe with a few tweaks.  Instead of a whole cup of olive oil, I used half olive oil, half vegetable oil, mostly for budgetary reasons.  It's still a lot of oil, though, but you can strain it and save it in the refrigerator for the next time you make tortilla española.  I also started cooking the onions before the potatoes to try get some caramelized flavor into the tortilla, à la Juana La Loca.  They were just starting to brown on the edges when I added the potatoes, but I think next time I'll wait even longer since they didn't really end up caramelized by the time the potatoes were done. Lastly, instead of just salt and pepper, I used this awesome Spanish flavored sea salt I picked up from El Corte Inglés that was seasoned with hot pepper, rosemary, black pepper, garlic, onion, parsley, and tomato.Tortilla Española (adapted from Mark Bittman)serves 3 as a main course and 6 as an appetizer1 1/4 lbs. potatoes (I used Russet, but Yukon Golds would work too)1 medium onion1 cup olive oil (or use 1/2 olive oil 1/2 vegetable oil)Salt and freshly ground pepper6 large eggsHeat the oil in an 8- or 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat.  Chop the onions and add to the oil with some salt and pepper.  Stir occasionally while you prepare the potatoes.Slice the potatoes thinly, using a mandoline if you have one.  Add to the oil along with some more salt and pepper and adjust the heat so that it bubbles lazily.  Cook until the potatoes are tender, but not brown.  While the potatoes are cooking, beat the eggs with some salt and pepper.Drain the potatoes and onions in a colander, reserving the oil.  Wipe the skillet clean and add two tablespoons of oil back to it.  Heat over medium heat.  Add the potatoes to the egg mixture and mix gently.  Transfer to the skillet.  After the edges firm up, about a minute or so, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 5 more minutes.Use a heat-proof rubber spatula to loosen the edges of the tortilla.  Place a large plate on top of the skillet and flip the tortilla onto it.  Add another tablespoon of oil into the skillet and slide the tortilla, cooked side up, back in.  Cook for another 5 minutes, using the spatula to coax the sides of the tortilla into a domed shape.  Slide onto a plate and serve warm or at room temperature.Next:  Maine Blueberry GateauPreviously:  Sesame Soba Noodles with Avocado RoseLast Year:  Taiwanese Oyster Omelet (Without the Oysters)Two Years Ago:  Candied Bacon Chocolate Chip PancakesThree Years Ago:  Rosemary Honey and Lemon Frozen YogurtSix Years Ago:  Passion Fruit Ice CreamSeven Years Ago:  Kalbi (Korean Barbecue Short Ribs)"},

To make one, slice an avocado in half.  You want a ripe avocado, but not one that is so soft it'll be hard to manipulate without smushing.Remove the pit, then carefully peel away the skin.  See that little bit of flesh left on the skin below?  It ended up being the only blemish on my rose.  =(Place on half cut side down on a cutting board and slice the avocado thinly.  It helps to use a paring knife since it has less surface area to stick to the avocado than a chef's knife (which I found out the hard way).Start shifting the slices diagonally.Try to make as long of a chain as you can make without breaking it. Start curling in one end of the chain and continue rolling it in until you've made a rose!To have something to eat with the avocado, I tried making some sesame soba noodles based on my go to peanut butter noodle recipe but using tahini instead of peanut butter.  I really liked how the buttery avocado added a cool creaminess to the sesame noodles, so much so that I'd pair the two again even if I didn't have enough time to make an avocado rose!Sesame Soba Noodles with Avocadomakes 2 servings2 handfuls of soba noodles3 tablespoons tahini3 tablespoons soy sauce1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil1 tablespoon rice wine vinegarA pinch of sugar1 avocadoSesame seeds and chopped scallions, for garnish (optional)Bring a pot of salted water to boil and add the soba noodles.  Cook until done.  Drain in a colander and run under cold water so that the noodles don't stick to each other.Mix the tahini, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice wine vinegar, and sugar until it forms a smooth paste.  Toss with the noodles, adding water to thin, if desired.Serve with sliced avocado and garnish with sesame seeds and chopped scallions, if desired.Next:  Tortilla Española (Spanish Potato Omelet)Previously:  Will It Puffle?Last Year:  Scoglio all'Andiamo (Saffron Fettuccine with Seafood in a Lemon Garlic White Wine Sauce)Two Years Ago:  Easy Chilquiles with Fried Egg and AvocadoSix Years Ago:  Lilikoi Malasadas (Portuguese Donuts filled with Passion Fruit Curd)Seven Years Ago:  Moffles!"},

I pretty much followed this Genius Recipe from Food52 for Dan Leader's 4-Hour Baguette but I applied some of the concepts I learned from Ken Forkish's Flour Water Salt Yeast and added some diastatic malt powder.  According to the King Arthur Flour website, the malt powder promotes \"a strong rise, great texture, and lovely brown crust\".  You can certainly make this bread without it; I just used because I still had some left from making croissants that one time.What I love about this recipe is that it doesn't call for any special equipment.  Don't have a stand mixer?  You can knead the dough by hand.  Don't have a pizza stone?  Use a rimless baking sheet or an upside-down baking sheet to bake the loaves on.  Don't have a baguette pan or a baker's couche?  Just use parchment paper and something long and weighted on the sides to help shape the loaves as they rise.  Don't have a bread lame?  Just use a sharp knife or even scissors!  As you can see, while I could definitely use more practice with shaping and scoring baguettes, I'm quite pleased with the results considering it was my first time!The 4-Hour Baguette (adapted from Dan Leader's recipe on Food52)makes 3 loaves1 1/2 cups warm water, about 115°F1 teaspoon active dry yeast2 cups all-purpose flour1 1/4 cups bread flour (if you don't have any bread flour, just use all-purpose flour)1 teaspoon diastatic malt powder (optional)3 teaspoons kosher saltOil, for greasing bowl1/2 cup ice cubes or 1 cup waterPlace the warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast over it.  Let stand for 10 minutes, until foamy. Add the flour(s) and malt powder (if using) and stir by hand with the dough hook until all the flour has been absorbed.  Let sit for 20 minutes to allow the flour to hydrate. Sprinkle the salt over the dough and knead using the dough hook attachment on medium speed, until smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes.  When done, wet your hands and reach underneath the dough and grab about a quarter of it.  Gently stretch this section of the dough up and fold it over the top to the other side of the dough.  Rotate the bowl 90° and repeat 3 more times.  This process is called applying a fold.  Transfer the dough seam side down to a lightly greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and place in a cold oven until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.After it has doubled, apply another fold, cover, and return to the oven again.  Let sit until doubled in size, about 1 hour.Remove the dough from the oven and place an oven-safe pan on the bottom rack.  Place a pizza stone or a rimless or upside-down baking sheet on the rack above.  Preheat oven to 475°F. Lightly flour a large piece of parchment paper and place on another rimless baking sheet or cutting board.  Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and cut the dough into 3 even pieces.  Shape each piece into a rectangle and fold the longer sides in to make a narrower rectangle, sealing the seams with the heel of your hand.  Gently roll the rectangle into a 14\" log.  Place the logs, seam side down, onto the parchment paper about 2-3\" apart from each other.  Lift up the paper between the logs to form pleats and hold them in place with foil/plastic wrap/parchment paper boxes on either end.  This helps shape the baguettes as they rise so that they expand up instead of out.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let sit until it doubles in size, about 50 minutes. When fully proofed, remove the plastic wrap and flatten out the parchment paper to space out the loaves.  Using a super-sharp knife, scissors, or bread lame, score the top of the dough in long, diagonal slashes.  Trim the parchment paper, if needed, so that it is about the same size as the pizza stone/baking sheet in the oven.Pull out the oven rack with the stone or baking sheet on it and, using the corner of the parchment paper as a guide, slide the loaves, still on the parchment paper, onto the baking stone or pan.  Place the ice cubes or water in the oven-proof pan (this produces steam that lets the loaves rise fully before a crust forms).  Bake the baguettes until darkly browned and crisp, 20 to 30 minutes; cool before serving.Next:  Will It Puffle?Previously:  Tropical Pulled Pork on Griddled Banana Bread SandwichesLast Year:  Chocolate Mochi Snack CakeTwo Years Ago:  Dan Bing (Taiwanese Egg Crepe)Three Years Ago:  Happiness CakeSix Years Ago:  Mama Huang's Secret Beer Duck RecipeSeven Years Ago:  Cincinnati Chili"},

Mix everything together and keep frying until the noodles become soft and translucent.  If the noodles are not fully cooked yet, add a splash of water and cook until done.  Taste and adjust for seasoning with additional pad thai sauce.Serve with the lime slices, reserved bean sprouts, roasted ground peanuts, ground dried chili powder, and additional sugar if you like.

{"title": "Mini Homemade Pretzel Dogs", "date": "Wednesday, October 28, 2015", "text": "My church held their second annual Highrocktoberfest last week and asked me if I could provide some snacks again.  Last year there was a competition for best cornbread, which I won with my Elote-Style Cornbread Waffles.  This year there was no such competition; I was just told to make something that would go well with beer.  Since I'm not a big beer drinker I wasn't really sure what that would be, but then I took inspiration from the fact that this was a riff on the German Oktoberfest. What could be more German than sausage and pretzel?I pretty much followed Alton Brown's soft pretzel recipe but decided to skip the salt in the pretzel dough since the sausage would provide enough salt.  I also threw in some diastatic malt powder since I had a lot left over from making croissants.  You can use cocktail weiners for this, but I was able to find mini kielbasa sausages at my grocery store so I went with those.  And instead of buying pretzel salt, I just used a flaky sea salt.  I wouldn't suggest using regular table salt for the topping, and even regular kosher salt might be too fine. Mini Homemade Pretzel Dogsmakes about 48 dogs2 1/4 cups warm water (about 110-115°F)1 1/2 tablespoons sugar3 3/4 teaspoons active dry yeast33 oz. (about 6 3/4 cups) all purpose flour1 tablespoon diastatic malt powder (optional)3 oz. butter, melted48 cocktail weiners or mini sausages2/3 cups baking soda1 large eggPretzel or flaky sea saltMix the water and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer, then sprinkle on the yeast.  Let sit for about 5 minutes until foamy. Add the flour, malt powder (if using), and melted butter and mix to combine on low using the dough hook.  Once the dough comes together, adjust the speed to medium and knead for 5 minutes.  Transfer to an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm spot until doubled, about an hour.Preheat the oven to 450°F. Divide the dough in half, then each half in half, each quarter in half, and each eighth in half.  You'll end up with 16 pieces of dough.  Divide each of these pieces into thirds so you end up with 48 pieces of dough.  One at a time, roll the dough into a long snake about 9\" long.  Starting at one end, wrap the dough around a weiner until it is completely encapsulated, sealing the ends.  If you have leftover dough, just pinch it off and reserve*.In a large pot, mix the baking soda with 10 cups of water and bring to a boil.  Working in batches, add the pretzel dogs to the boiling water and cook for 30 seconds.  Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a parchment or Silpat-lined baking sheet, 1\" apart from each other.Beat the egg with a tablespoon of water.  Brush each of the pretzel dogs with the egg wash and sprinkle with the salt.  Bake for 10-12 minutes, until dark golden brown.  Cool on a wire rack.  Serve with honey mustard dip (recipe below).*If you have enough extra dough, you can try making some traditional pretzels!Honey Mustard Dipmakes 1 1/2 cups1 cup mayonnaise1/4 cup mustard (I used a mix of yellow mustard and whole grain mustard)1/4 cup honeyMix together and serve with the pretzel dogs.I made this dip to go with the pretzel dogs, but after all those were gone, they put out hard pretzels to snack on and it went really well with those too!Next:  Pad ThaiPreviously:  Pasta con le SardeLast Year:  Mochi Donuts and Pon de RingsTwo Years Ago:  Bahian Style Moqueca (Brazilian Fish Stew)Three Years Ago:  Magical Cold Brew Coffee"},

I also left out the cilantro since I hate the herb, but if it's your thing, definitely add some as a garnish at the end.Tofu Tikka Masala (lightly adapted from Food52)serves 4For the tofu:14 oz. extra-firm tofu, drained1/2 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced3 teaspoons garlic, minced 2 tablespoons vegetable oil1 cup Greek yogurt 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander1/2 teaspoon ground cumin1 teaspoon salt1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepperPat the tofu dry and slice into 3/4\" slabs.  In large bowl, whisk together the ginger, garlic, oil, and yogurt; set aside.Combine the coriander, cumin, salt, and cayenne in small bowl.

{"title": "Gordon Ramsay's Sublime Scrambled Eggs - Two Ways", "date": "Wednesday, April 29, 2015", "text": "A few weeks ago I got this delightful e-mail from my friend Lyh-Rhen asking if I wanted to buy any eggs hatched by the chickens from his farm.  Boy, did I ever!  I love looking at all the pictures of the flowers that Fivefork Farms grows, but I travel way too much to justify joining their flower CSA.  So I was super happy to be able to support them in a way that I can really utilize.Aren't they so pretty?  I love the light green ones the most.  So far I've used them to make homemade pasta, baked goods, shakshuka, and my all-time favorite way to eat eggs, but I wanted to try something new, something special to highlight the farm fresh eggs.Then I remembered a recent conversation I had with some friends about this video of Gordon Ramsay making scrambled eggs.  I don't even remember how it came up, but as soon as someone mentioned it (it might even have been me), everyone else who had ever seen it ecstatically chimed in.  This video has over 10 million views, and quite a few of those are mine.  There's just something really fascinating about watching someone so confident in the kitchen taking something so simple and describing it in a way that elevates it to a whole other level.  If you haven't watched it yet yourself, you should definitely do it when you have a chance.  You'll never make scrambled eggs the same way again.If you don't have time to watch it right now, what you need to know is that adding salt too early in the process breaks down the eggs too much so it becomes a watery mess.  In the same vein, Gordon doesn't beat the eggs before cooking them; he cracks the eggs into a cold pan and starts stirring it in there with some cold butter over heat.  By constantly stirring the eggs and taking it off the heat when the pan gets too hot, you get perfectly creamy eggs which are on the complete opposite end of the spectrum from the rubbery, dry version you may be used to.  He also adds crème fraîche to prevent the eggs from overcooking at the end, but since I didn't have any, I just skipped the step.Gordon serves the scrambled eggs over toast that's been drizzled with olive oil.  I decided to try an Asian twist by adding chopped scallions to the eggs and drizzling the toast with sesame oil.  Both versions are truly sublime.Gordon Ramsay's Sublime Scrambled Eggs (adapted from Gordon Ramsay Makes It Easy)makes 1 serving 2 thick slices of crusty bread3 large free-range eggs1 1/2 tablespoons ice-cold butter diced1 tablespoon crème fraîche or sour cream (optional)Kosher salt and freshly ground pepperClassic Version: Few chives, snippedGood quality olive oilJoy's Version:Scallions, choppedToasted sesame oilBreak the eggs into a cold, heavy-based pan, add half the butter, and place onto the stove over generous heat. Using a spatula, stir the eggs frequently to combine the yolks with the whites.As the mixture begins to set, add the remaining butter. The eggs will take about 4-5 minutes to scramble – they should still be soft and quite lumpy. Don’t let them get too hot – keep moving the pan off and back on the heat.In the meantime, toast the bread.Add the crème fraîche (if using) and season the eggs at the last minute with the salt and pepper, then add the snipped chives or chopped scallions, depending on which version you're making.Drizzle the toast with the olive oil or sesame oil and pile the softly scrambled eggs on top.  Serve immediately.Next:  Scoglio all'Andiamo (Saffron Fettuccine with Seafood in a Lemon Garlic White Wine Sauce) Previously:  Chocolate Mochi CakeLast Year:  Nutella Mini Crepe CakesFive Years Ago:  Lilikoi Malasadas (Portuguese Donuts Filled with Passion Fruit Curd)Six Years Ago:  Stuffed Artichokes"},

{"title": "A Better Homemade Pasta Recipe", "date": "Tuesday, March 3, 2015", "text": "I had three egg yolks left over from making the matcha financiers, so it was perfect timing that I came across this recipe which needed 3 egg yolks (plus 1 whole egg) for making homemade pasta.  I've posted about making pasta before, but even then I commented on how it didn't look like the homemade pasta I had eaten in Italy.  I had hopes that using more egg yolks would make a difference, giving me something closer in looks and taste.I'm going to share two tips I use when making pasta:  one I came up with on my own, and one I learned from Lady and Pups.  First, instead of making the dough straight on your counter- or tabletop, make it in a rimmed baking sheet.  That way if the eggs accidentally spill over your flour well (like mine did), it won't run all over the place.Second, I love this genius tip from Lady and Pups:  seal the ends of your dough together once you're ready to roll your pasta thinner in a pasta machine so that you don't have to refeed the dough in every time you change the setting.  It makes the dough so much easier to work with, especially once the dough gets super thin and long!This dough is pretty dry, so you might want to wet your hands while kneading it just until everything comes together.  Then you can take the easy way out and throw it into your stand mixer (with the dough hook attachment) to continue kneading, if you have one.  If not, keep kneading until it's nice and glossy; it will take a while, but you'll get there eventually.After you've rolled out the dough so that it's so thin it's almost transparent, you can cut it into any width you want:  super wide for pappardelle, wide for fettuccine, thin for tagliatelle, or super thin for bavettine.  This pasta is so good you'll just want to toss it with a really simple sauce so you can really appreciate the noodles.  Here I've made it aglio e olio, with just some garlic and olive oil, and a pinch of salt and red pepper flakes.  Buon appetito!A Better Homemade Pasta Recipe (adapted from Food52)makes 2 servings1 cup all-purpose flour1 large egg3 large egg yolksA pinch of saltOn a large, rimmed baking sheet, make a pile with the flour and dig a well in the middle.  Crack the egg into the well and add the egg yolks and salt.Using a fork, start stirring the eggs and slowly incorporating more and more of the flour into the well until you have a nice, thick paste.  Combine with the rest of the flour and start kneading with your hands.  If the dough is too dry, wet your hands as many times as you need just for it to all come together.Continue kneading by hand or in a stand mixer (with the dough hook attachment) until you have a smooth, uniform dough.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rest for at least 20 minutes.  At this point you can refrigerate the dough, well wrapped, overnight and bring it back to room temperature the next day before continuing.Cut the dough in half.  Run one half through the pasta machine set at its widest setting.  Fold the dough in thirds and run through the machine again, repeating 3 times.  Then, run the dough halfway through and pinch the ends together so it forms a loop.  Adjust the setting to one notch thinner and roll through, continuing to adjust the setting one notch thinner each time the loop has gone all the way around.  When the dough looks almost transparent, stop and cut the dough out of the machine and then in half.  Repeat the whole process with the other half of the dough.  You will end up with 4 sheets of pasta dough.If your dough is feeling tacky at this point, let it dry a bit on some tea towels.  Otherwise, you can go ahead and fold the dough in half three times so you have a manageable width to cut.  Using a sharp knife, cut the noodles into the width you desire.  Shake out the noodles and let them dry some more on the tea towel.Bring a pot of salted water to a rolling boil.  Add the pasta and stir occasionally so that the noodles don't stick to each other.  The pasta is done when they float to the surface.  Remove from the water immediately to preserve its perfect al dente texture.  Toss with the sauce of your choice.A few suggestions for sauces:First Night in Florence Spaghetti (tuna, tomatoes, lemon, olive oil, and garlic)Aglio e Olio (garlic and olive oil)Cacio e Pepe (cheese and black pepper) Shaved Truffles and ButterAmatriciana (tomato and guanciale/pancetta/bacon)Carbonara (eggs and guanciale/pancetta/bacon)Marcella Hazan's Tomato Butter SauceSlow Cooker Bolognese (tomato and ground meat) Next:  Cacio e Pepe for One Previously:  Matcha Financiers with White Chocolate CentersLast Year:  Mushroom Marsala PizzaTwo Years Ago:  Peking Duck PizzaFive Years Ago:  Bacon Fat CaramelsSix Years Ago:  Potato Leek Soup with Bacon"},
{"title": "Matcha Financiers with White Chocolate Centers", "date": "Thursday, February 26, 2015", "text": "Here is yet another recipe from Dorie Greenspan's Baking Chez Moi (and probably not the last)!  I first discovered financiers at Eric Kayser's bakery near my hotel in Paris. They looked like perfect little miniature cakes that were basically unadorned--a distinct change from all the super-frosted and decorated cupcakes that were all the rage in America at the time.  They're just one or two bites each and less sweet than a cupcake, more substantial than a muffin.  Perfect for packing and eating on the go without having to worry about getting a crazy sugar rush.Since I'm currently in love with the matcha/white chocolate flavor combination, I was excited when I saw Dorie's \"bonne idée\" for her matcha financier recipe:  baking chunks of white chocolate in the center of each financier.  I used 2 white chocolate chips per financier, but I think I would at least add a third if not more next time since it just wasn't enough (for me, anyway).  I also increased the amount of matcha slightly since I could barely taste the matcha in the first batch I made.Matcha Financiers with White Chocolate Centers (slightly adapted from Dorie Greenspan's Baking Chez Moi)makes 12 small cakes 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into chunks1/3 cup all-purpose flour1 teaspoon matcha green teaPinch of fine sea salt1/2 cup sugar1/2 cup almond flour3 large egg whites, at room temperature, lightly beatenWhite chocolate chipsHeat the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until it starts to boil, then boil for 1 minute; it may color ever so slightly, but you don’t want it to brown. Remove the pan from the heat and set it aside (you want the butter to be warm when you add it).Whisk the all-purpose flour, matcha, and salt together in a small bowl.Using a flexible spatula, stir the sugar and almond flour together in a large bowl. Gradually add the egg whites, stirring to moisten the dry ingredients.When all the whites are in, give the mix a few vigorous stirs. Stir in the all-purpose flour mixture, mixing only until it’s evenly blended, then start adding the melted butter, a little at a time, folding and stirring the batter until all the butter is in.Press a piece of plastic film against the surface of the batter and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. (The batter can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)Preheat the oven to 400°F. Butter the wells of a mini muffin tin, dust with flour and tap out the excess.Spoon the batter into the muffin cups, filling them about halfway.  Drop 2-4 white chocolate chips into each, then spoon on additional batter, almost to the top of the well.Bake the financiers for 12 to 14 minutes, or until they have crowned and feel springy to the touch.  Remove from the oven, wait 1 minute, then tap them against the counter to encourage the financiers to tumble out. Pry any stragglers from their molds with a table knife. Transfer the financiers to a rack and let cool until they are just warm or at room temperature.By the way, don't throw out the 3 egg yolks after separating them from the 3 egg whites needed for this recipe!  You can use them to make really good pasta dough!

{"title": "Hugo & Victor's Pink Grapefruit Tart", "date": "Tuesday, February 24, 2015", "text": "There are two things I tell my friends to get when they go to Paris:  the mango passion caramels from Jacques Genin and this pink grapefruit tart from Hugo & Victor.  So when I saw a recipe for the tart in Dorie Greenspan's Baking Chez Moi, I was ecstatic!  I even bought a $25 bottle of Campari just so I could have the 2 1/2 tablespoons needed to make the grapefruit crémeux because I wanted to follow the recipe as close as possible.And yet so many things went wrong, mostly because I was impatient.  First the sweet tart dough shattered when I tried to fit it into the tart pan because I hadn't waited long enough for it to warm up a bit after letting it chill in the freezer.  Luckily, this was pretty easy to fix because you could just patch up the cracks but pressing the extra dough in.  (next time I'll just fit the crust into the tart pan after rolling it out and then chill it, which is how I wrote the recipe below.)  Then, when it was time to add the grapefruit crémeux (which I think is just a fancy French word for gelatinous cream), I didn't whisk it long enough so it was still kind of curdy when I spread it on.  Again, I was kind of fortunate because the grapefruit topping hides most of it, and the texture doesn't affect the taste at all.That said, please learn from my mistakes and take plenty of time to make this tart.  I'd definitely start the sweet tart dough and maybe the grapefruit crémeux the day before.  There's lot of chilling the dough, then blind baking it, then cooling it, then baking it again (with the lemon-almond cream), and cooling it again before topping it with the crémeux and grapefruit topping and then chilling it one last time to set before serving.  But it's worth it!  Not only is it totally beautiful to look at, it tastes incredible.  Even people who don't like grapefruit love this tart!  I think it helps that you've done some of the hard work by removing all the membrane from the grapefruit segments already so that all you have to do is take a bite, and you get the tartness of the fruit, a hint of bitterness from the Campari, sweetness from the fillings, and lots of buttery richness from the snappy crust.Hugo & Victor's Pink Grapefruit Tart (adapted from Dorie Greenspan's Baking Chez Moi)makes 1 tartFor the sweet tart dough:1 1/2 cups (204 g) all-purpose flour1/2 cup (60 g) confectioners' sugar1/4 teaspoon kosher salt9 tablespoons very cold unsalted butter1 large egg yolkPut the flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt in a food processor and pulse a few times to blend.  Cut the butter into small pieces and scatter over the dry ingredients.  Pulse until the butter is cut in coarsely.Stir the yolk just to break it up and drizzle over the rest of the ingredients.  Pulse until the egg is incorporated, then process in longer pulses, about 10 seconds each, until the dough forms clumps and curds.   Finish blending the dough by turning it out onto a work surface and smearing small amounts across the surface with the heel of your hand.Shape the dough into a disk and place between two sheets of parchment or wax paper.  Roll the dough out evenly until it is about 12\" in diameter.  Carefully fit into a buttered tart pan and trim the excess dough.  Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or if you're short on time, for 1 hour in the freezer.Preheat the oven to 400°F.  Prick the crust all over with a fork.  Butter the shiny side of a piece of aluminum foil and fit snugly on top of the crust.  Fill with pie weights (you can use dried beans, rice, etc.).  Bake the crust for 25 minutes, then carefully remove the foil and weights.  Bake for another 7-10 minutes, until firm and golden brown.  Cool the crust completely.For the grapefruit crémeux:2 teaspoons powdered gelatin, bloomed in 1 1/2 tablespoons cold water3/4 cup (150) g sugar2 large pink grapefruits3 large eggs14 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature2 1/2 tablespoons CampariPut the sugar in a 2- to 3-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and grate the grapefruits over it.  Rub the sugar and zest together with your fingertips until the sugar is moist.  Squeeze the juice from the grapefruits into a measuring up until you have 3/4 cup of juice.  Add the eggs to the sugar and start whisking immediately.  Continue to whisk as you add the juice.Place the saucepan over medium heat and continue whisking.  Eventually, after 7-9 minutes, the custard will start to thicken.  When it reaches 180°F (or when the first bubble pops at the surface), remove from the heat and strain into a blender.Allow the custard to sit in the blender for about 5 minutes, pulsing a few times to help the cooling process.  Heat the bloomed gelatin in the microwave for 15 seconds to liquefy, then add to the blender.  Blend on high, and start adding the butter, two tablespoons at a time.  After all the butter has been incorporated, add the Campari and blend until homogenous in color.  Scrape the crémeux into a bowl, press a piece of plastic wrap to the surface, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours. For the topping:2 large pink grapefruitsAbout 3 hours (or up to 8 hours) before you want to serve the tart, cut off all the peel and pith away from the tart.  You want to carefully cut through the outer membrane of the grapefruit, too.  Then, using a small paring knife, cut on either sides of the membranes in between each section to release each section.  There should be no membrane left on the sections.  Place the segments on several layers of paper towels, cover with more paper towels, and allow to dry at room temperature.  At this point, you can try arranging the segments to see if you'll have enough to cover the surface of the tart.For the lemon-almond cream:3 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar1/2 cup (50 g) almond flourFinely grated zest of 1 lemon1 large egg, at room temperatureBeat butter until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes.  Beat in the brown sugar for a minute, and then beat in the almond flour and grated zest until smooth again.  Add the egg and beat until fully incorporated.  Refrigerate for at least an hour.Assembling the tart:Preheat the oven to 375°F.  Whisk the chilled lemon-almond cream until it is spreadable.  Spread the cream over the bottom of the tart crust and bake for 6-7 minutes, until the cream is set.  Cool the tart completely before the next step.About 2 hours before you want to serve the tart, whisk the grapefruit crémeux until it's smooth (unlike the picture above).  Spread over the lemon-almond cream.  Arrange the grapefruit segments on top of the crémeux.  Chill the tart for another 2-8 hours before serving.Next:  Matcha Financiers with White Chocolate Centers Previously:  First Night in Florence SpaghettiTwo Years Ago:  Cauliflower Steak with Cauliflower PuréeSix Years Ago:  Boston Cream Cupcakes"},
{"title": "First Night in Florence Spaghetti", "date": "Tuesday, February 17, 2015", "text": "I have made this dish four times in as many days since I first discovered it.  Maybe it's because I'm feeling nostalgic for Italy and wanting to get out of this crazy New England snow.  Maybe it's the way the olive oil, tomatoes, and lemon juice come together like magic to make this unbelievably fresh tasting sauce.  Or maybe it's the way the tuna and garlic linger on the tongue and then in my dreams.  Whatever it is, you need to make this pasta stat.This dish comes together quickly; while the pasta is cooking, you'll be starting the sauce so that by the time the pasta is almost al dente, you toss it into the pan that the sauce is in to finish cooking it.  So I usually start cutting up the tomatoes and mincing the garlic while I wait for the water to boil.For this recipe, make sure you use the tuna that's packed in olive oil, not water.  And don't pour out the oil; add it to the sauce.  Speaking of olive oil, you'll want to use a good one, and lots of it.  I used the last of the olive oil I got from Tuscany for this, and it was worth it.  I also used the last of the squid ink pasta I got from Venice since I figured the brininess would go well with the tuna (and because it's photogenic).  All this just means I'll have to go back to Italy soon to stock up again!First Night in Florence Spaghetti (adapted from The Solitary Cook by way of Food52)serves 21/2 package of spaghetti Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, to tasteGood olive oil, and lots of it1 pint grape tomatoes, quartered3 cloves garlic, minced1 tin of tuna packed in olive oilA few handfuls of spinach or Swiss chard leavesJuice of 1/2 a lemonGet a large pot of salted water boiling.  Add the pasta and start a timer to cook for 3 minutes less than what the package calls for (i.e. if the package says to cook the spaghetti for 10 minutes, cook it for 7).In a pan large enough to hold all the pasta, add 5-6 generous glugs of olive oil heat on medium-high (it should be at least twice what you think you'll need).  Once the oil starts to shimmer, add the tomatoes and a generous pinch of salt.  While the tomatoes soften, you may want to (carefully!) smoosh them to help release their juices.  When there are 2 minutes left on the pasta, add the minced garlic.  When there is 1 minute left on the pasta, add the tuna plus the oil it's packed in, breaking up any large chunks of fish.When the timer is up on the pasta, use tongs or a pasta spoon to add the spaghetti to the pan.  Add some of the pasta cooking water to the pan too (the original recipe calls for a few ladlefuls, but I like a little less than that).  Add the greens and lemon juice and toss everything around, cooking until the leaves is just wilted.  Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper as needed.  Next:  Hugo & Victor's Pink Grapefruit Tart Previously:  Odile's Fresh Orange CakeLast Year:  OkonomiyakiSix Years Ago:  New England Clam Chowda with Homemade Oyster Crackers"},
{"title": "Odile's Fresh Orange Cake", "date": "Friday, February 13, 2015", "text": "I came across Dorie Greenspan's Baking Chez Moi cookbook at my local library the other day and borrowed it without even opening it.  I've made some of her recipes in the past and totally trust her authority in all things baking, just like I trust Jeni's in all things frozen.  I was a little disappointed that there weren't pictures for every recipe in the book, but maybe that's a good thing because otherwise I'd want to make (and eat) every single last thing in there.The first thing that caught my eye was this fresh orange cake that had beautiful slices of glistening oranges on top.  As I was currently sitting at home in the midst of the third snowstorm to hit in as many weeks, I desperately needed a reminder of something warm and sunny.I made just a few adjustments to her recipe; since I didn't have an 8\" cake pan, I used a pie pan, which was 8\" at the bottom but wider on top.  This just meant more space for the showstopping orange topping.  And after cutting a few of the oranges into her suggested pentagon shape, I realized I was wasting a lot less of the orange if I cut them into hexagons instead.  I think hexagons are easier to arrange together than pentagons anyways (or maybe I've just been playing too much Civilization V).  In her recipe, she says you only need 3 oranges to fill the top of your cake, but I found I needed a lot more, like almost the whole bag.  I guess it depends on the size of your oranges, but one way you can estimate how many slices you need is to poach them in a pot the same diameter as the top of your cake.  If you arrange them in a single layer in the pot, you'll see if you need to keep cutting up more oranges to cover the bottom.Odile's Fresh Orange Cake (slightly adapted from Dorie Greenspan's Baking Chez Moi)makes 1 cakeFor the cake:3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons all purpose flour1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 cup sugar1 large orange1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature2 large eggs, at room temperatureFor the topping:At least 3 oranges, possibly a lot more 1 cup sugar1 cup water1 cinnamon stick (optional)2 tablespoons orange marmaladeCenter a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F.  Butter an 8-inch round cake pan, dust with flour and tap out the excess. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl. Put the sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl in which you can use a hand mixer. Grate the zest of the orange over the sugar. Squeeze the juice into a measuring cup–you should have about 1/3 cup, but a little more or a tad less won’t throw things off.Rub the sugar and zest together with your fingertips until the sugar is moist and fragrant. If you’re using a stand mixer, fit it with the paddle attachment and attach the bowl. Add the butter to the bowl and beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes, until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating for 1 minute after each one goes in, then pour in the juice and beat to blend. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the dry ingredients, mixing only until they disappear into the batter. The batter may look a little lumpy and grainy, but that’s fine. Turn the batter out into the cake pan and smooth the top.  Bake the cake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.In the meantime, make the topping.  Cut the tops and bottoms off each orange, stand the orange up and remove the remaining peel by cutting straight down the sides of the orange 6 times, to shape it into a hexagon.  Then turn the oranges on their sides and slice them about 3/8\" thick.Bring the sugar, water, and cinnamon stick to boil in a medium saucepan, then reduce the heat and simmer for 2 minutes.  Gently drop the orange slices into the syrup and cook over low heat for 3 minutes.  Carefully remove the slices with a slotted spoon; strain and reserve the syrup.Arrange the orange slices on top of the cake and pour about a 1/2 cup of the poaching syrup over the oranges and cake.  Melt the marmalade and brush it over the fruit.  Cool the cake completely before slicing and serving.Next:  First Night in Florence Spaghetti Previously:  Heart-Shaped Tamagoyaki (Japanese Omelet)Last Year:  Squid Ink Spaghetti Aglio e OlioTwo Years Ago:  Jjajungmyeon (Korean Black Bean Noodles)"},

Depending on what else you have on hand, you can add a plethora of toppings:  toasted sesame seeds, sliced almonds, chopped scallions, shredded chicken, baked tofu, and shredded cucumbers are just a few ideas.  You can serve this dish cold or at room temperature so it's easily packable for lunch, picnic, or potluck.  See, I told you it was easy!  The hardest part about this recipe might be trying to mix the peanut butter into the other liquids without splashing, but if you stir carefully and long enough, you'll end up with a smooth, homogenous peanut sauce.Peanut Butter Noodlesserves as many as you want3 parts peanut butter3 parts soy sauce1 part sesame oil1 part vinegar (rice wine vinegar preferred)A pinch of sugarCooked noodlesMix the peanut butter, soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar, and sugar together until the sauce becomes smooth and creamy.Toss with the cooked noodles, adding some of the pasta water if you want to thin out the sauce.  Serve with  toasted sesame seeds, sliced almonds, chopped scallions, shredded chicken, baked tofu, and/or shredded cucumbers if you like.Next:  San Bei (Taiwanese Three Cup) Tofu and RamenPreviously:  Zuppa ToscanaLast Year:  Flower Pavlovas, Banoffee PieTwo Years Ago:  Spicy Tuna with Crispy Sushi Rice, Traditional CroissantsFive Years Ago:  Banana Bread Yeasted WafflesSix Years Ago:  Nian Gao (Mochi Cake), Mayonnaise Shrimp with Candied Walnuts"},

Stir until the mixture forms a loose, shaggy dough, then use the dough hook of the stand mixer to knead until the dough forms a semi-smooth ball. Add the butter to the dough, one tablespoon at a time, kneading after each addition.  Knead until the butter is fully incorporated and the dough becomes smooth and elastic.Place the dough in a large bowl with plenty of room and cover loosely with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Let rise for 1-2 hours in a warm, draft-free area, or until well-doubled. Alternatively, let the dough rise overnight in the refrigerator; the dough should be fine for up to 24 hours.  Line a round cake pan or square brownie pan with parchment paper.Once the dough has doubled, punch it down and divide into 24 even pieces.  You can either use a food scale or divide the dough in half three times and then into thirds (2 * 2 * 2 * 3 = 24).  Working one a a time, roll out the dough into a flat circle about 3\" in diameter.  If you can, try to make the edges thinner than the middle, but it's not super critical.Drop a heaping tablespoon of Thanksgiving leftovers onto the middle of the dough.  Bring the edges of the dough together and seal.  I like to do this using the method I learned to wrap xiao long bao, but since the seal will be concealed on the bottom, it's fine to just bring four opposite parts of the dough together and then pinch together the edges in between together.  You just want to make sure that the filling is sealed inside.  Roll the ball a bit in your hands to reform a sphere.Arrange the stuffed dough balls seam side down in the prepared pan just so they touch each other.  You may run out of room in the pan (I could only fit 19 balls, so I set the remaining in a smaller baking dish).  Brush the top of the rolls with olive oil and let the dough proof again until they are almost doubled, about another hour or so.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.Bake the rolls for about 25-35 minutes, until golden brown.  Serve warm with butter and any leftover cranberry sauce and/or gravy.Next:  Puppy Chow Pie Previously:  Jeni's Crème Sans Lait (Dairy Free Ice Cream)Last Year:  Thai Coconute Sticky Rice with MangoTwo Years Ago:  Three Bean ChiliFive Years Ago:  Kettle CornSix Years Ago:  Salted Butter Caramel Ice Cream"},

Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the cranberries burst and are very soft, about 10 minutes more.  Using a large spoon to mash the cranberries a bit so it is easier to strain in the next step.    Strain the sauce into a bowl through a fine-mesh sieve, pushing the solids against the screen with the spoon. Stir the thin and thick portions of the strained gelée together.    Transfer to a pretty serving bowl or jar.  Cover and refrigerate. It will firm up within a few hours, or can be made several days ahead.Since I'm hosting Thanksgiving this year, I'll be serving this along with a spatchcocked turkey and also making my corn souffle and a sweet potato casserole.  Others are bringing the salad, mashed potatoes, green beans, and pie.  What will you be having for Thanksgiving?p.s.  The reason for the sub-par pictures above is because instead of making the cranberry sauce and taking pictures of it when the sun was still out, I made a last minute decision to go hiking with some friends in the Middlesex Fells since it was probably going to be one of the last nice days of 2014.  While the pics above rather flat and uninteresting, it was worth it to spend time with good friends and to get this shot:Next:  Jeni's Crème Sans Lait (Dairy-Free Ice Cream) Previously:  Sriracha PopcornLast Year:  My Mom's Pi Jiu Ya (Beer Braised Duck)Two Years Ago:  Pretzel Ice Cream Pie with Homemade Magic ShellFives Years Ago:  Nanaimo Bars"},

Sriracha Popcorn when I was in the midst of a cold and could barely taste a thing.  The intense taste of sriracha cut through everything though, and the crunchiness of the popcorn only added to it being the best thing I had eaten since I started getting sick.Even after I had regained all my taste buds and sense of smell, I couldn't stop eating the snack even though I'm usually not a big fan of spicy stuff.  I checked the list of ingredients and noticed that sugar was included.  Of course!  I don't know how it works, but I know you can add sugar to a dish if it's too spicy to make it more palatable.  I bet the sugar was doing the same thing here while also making it super addictive, like a buttery, spicy, garlicky kettle corn.Since I'm kind of a wimp in terms of spiciness, I only used 2 teaspoons of sriracha in this recipe, but if really like things spicy, I imagine that doubling that amount or more might work better for you.  At a certain point, though, you might have too much liquid, which would make the popcorn soggy, so you'd be better off making some sriracha salt and sprinkling that on.Sriracha Popcornmakes 6 cups 6 cups freshly popped popcorn2 tablespoons butter1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (plus more, to taste) 1/2 teaspoon sugar2-4 teaspoons sriracha Place the butter, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and sugar in a microwaveable measuring cup with a spout and microwave for 45-60 seconds, until the butter is melted.  Add the sriracha and stir.Drizzle half of the sauce over the popcorn in a large bowl.  Shake to distribute and then drizzle the other half.  Shake again to combine.  Add more salt, to taste, if desired.Next:  Cranberry-Port Gelée  Previously:  Spatchcock Chicken and Roasted Root VegetablesLast Year:  My Mom's Taiwanese Sticky RiceTwo Years Ago:  Grapefruit PieSix Years Ago:  Homemade Crystallized Ginger"},
{"title": "Spatchcock Chicken with Roasted Root Vegetables", "date": "Monday, November 10, 2014", "text": "A few months ago my friend Ellen posted a gorgeous picture of the best roast chicken she had ever made and challenged us to name the technique she used to make it.  From the picture, I knew immediately it was a spatchcocked chicken, and I've been wanting to try it ever since.  Well, this weekend we needed some cooked chicken to make curry chicken tea sandwiches for Amy's baby shower, so I volunteered to make the chicken instead of just buying a rotisserie chicken.Spatchcocking a chicken just means cutting out the backbone and then butterflying the chicken so that you can roast it flat.  This way the dark meat and white meat cook more evenly, and you can also cook it a lot faster than roasting it whole.  Usually you have to use a lot of pressure to force the bird to \"crack\" open, but this post from Epicurious mentions making a notch on the sternum bone/cartilage before flipping the bird over which makes it a lot easier.  I was also inspired by The Crepes of Wrath's post to dry brine the chicken overnight and roast it on top of vegetables to catch all the delicious drippings.  It reminded me of the roasted potatoes from the Roli Roti food truck at the San Francisco Ferry Building Farmers market. They're piled underneath the spinning rotisserie meat so they absorb all the dripping goodness and then topped with a sprinkle of rosemary salt, which I totally copied here on the potatoes and multi-colored carrots I got in my recent Boston Organics delivery.The end result is a gloriously moist, crispy skinned chicken with amazingly flavored vegetables using a bare minimum of ingredients.  You can use this same technique to make your Thanksgiving turkey, too!Spatchcock Chicken with Roasted Root Vegetablesserves 4-61 large chickenKosher saltOlive oil3 lbs. root vegetables, chopped into 3/4\" chunks (potatoes, carrots, onions, etc.)1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemaryThe night before you want to roast the chicken, pat the chicken dry with paper towels.  Rub about 1/2 cup of kosher salt all over and inside the chicken, even under the skin if possible.  Place a cooling rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet and place the chicken on top of the rack.  Transfer to the refrigerator to dry brine overnight.The next day, preheat the oven to 450°F.  Place the chicken breast side down on a cutting board.  Using kitchen shears or a sharp knife, cut out the backbone starting from the tail end.  You can save the backbone for making chicken stock and/or gravy.  Pull the bird open wider and cut through the bone in the center of the breast.  Flip the bird over and flatten so that the thighs are knock-kneed.  Fold the wings underneath.  Brush all over with olive oil.Wash the baking sheet and line with aluminum foil.  Toss the root vegetables with a few drizzles of olive oil.  Spread on top of the foil and replace the cooling rack.  Place the chicken breast side up on the cooling rack and place the whole thing in the oven.  Roast for 30 minutes at 450°F, then turn the temperature down to 400°F and continue to roast until a thermometer stuck into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165°F (about 15-30 minutes, depending on the size of the bird).Allow the chicken to rest at least 10 minutes before carving.  Mix a tablespoon of kosher salt with the chopped rosemary.  Sprinkle on top of the vegetables and serve alongside the chicken.  Next:  Sriracha Popcorn Previously:  Caramel Apple Cinnamon RollsTwo Years Ago:  Duchikey (or Simplified Turducken)"},

Place the milk, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup butter, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Stir together to dissolve the sugar until the mixture is just warm (the butter should be just melted).  Pour the milk mixture into the mixing bowl containing the flour and yeast.  Add the egg.  Beat with paddle attachment for 30 seconds on low speed.  Beat on high speed for 3 minutes.  Stir in as much of the remaining flour as the dough can take.  Knead 3-5 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic (you can do this with a dough hook and finish by hand or knead by hand).  Grease a large bowl with the vegetable oil.  Shape the dough into a ball and place in the large greased bowl.  Turn the dough over to coat the entire thing with oil.  Cover and let rise in a warm place for 45-60 minutes or until the volume has doubled.In a medium bowl, combine the brown sugar, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, and 1 tablespoon cinnamon.  Cut 1/2 cup butter into the mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.  Set aside.Pour the apple cider into a medium saucepan and warm over medium-high heat.  Let the cider boil down until it has reduced to 1/4 cup in volume (doesn’t have to be exact, but no more than 1/3 cup), about 20 minutes.   Measure out the cream into a microwaveable measuring cup and microwave for 30 seconds .  Place the sugar in a clean medium saucepan over medium heat.  When the sugar begins to melt, gently swirl it around to distribute the rest of the unmelted sugar.  When completely melted, let the liquid sugar turn a medium to dark amber color.  Slowly pour the hot cream into the caramelized sugar while stirring.  It will splatter and bubble, that’s okay, keep stirring. Return the pan to low heat and stir until all of the hard caramelized sugar has melted and your sauce has thickened, about 20 minutes.  Stir in the reduced apple cider, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon sea salt, and vanilla.Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a lightly-floured large (bigger than 24×16 inches) work surface.  Alternatively, you can halve the dough and work on a smaller surface, which is what I did.  Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 10 minutes.  Butter two 9-inch round pans or two 8-inch square pans.  Pour half of the apple cider caramel in each pan.  Set aside.  Roll the dough out into a 24×16-inch rectangle, if you're working with all the dough at once.  If you're only working with half, roll out into a 12x16-in rectangle.  Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar filling evenly over the rectangle, leaving a 1-inch margin bare along the long side furthest from you (this is to make sure you can pinch it closed when you roll it up).  Do the same with the diced apple.Roll up the dough incrementally to ensure that the filling stays put.  Pinch the clean edge onto the roll to seal it.  Cut the roll into 14 equal-width pieces if you are using the round pans and 18 equal-width pieces if you are using the square pans.  Set the slices cut-side down in the baking pans, cover and let rise for 45 minutes until doubled in volume.Preheat oven to 350°F.  Uncover the rolls and bake for 45 minutes until lightly browned.  If using 2-inch high pans, you may want to set foil or a baking sheet under the rack to catch any caramel drips.  Invert the baking pans onto a serving plate and serve warm.Next:  Spatchcock Chicken with Roasted Root VegetablesPreviously:  Raindrop CakeTwo Years Ago:  Cereal Milk Panna Cotta with Cornflake Crunch"},

I'm not going to lie, this tasted pretty much like water-flavored Jell-o.  I did add a pinch of vanilla sugar to the mixture, but it was barely noticeable.  The texture sensation was great, though.  It holds just for a second in your mouth before dissolving into a cool, crisp liquid.I added a few black sesame seeds on top of the first cake I tried, more for show than for taste (it tasted pretty bad).  Since I made two half-spheres each time, for the second cake I decided to try some more flavorful toppings.  The original is served with a black sugar syrup and roasted soybean powder, neither of which I had, but I thought I'd try sprinkling on some sweet black sesame instant drink powder and a splash of half and half.  I really liked the addition of the sweet black sesame powder, but next time I might try sweetened condensed milk instead of half and half.  Raindrop Cake (adapted from here)makes 2 cakes2/3 cup spring waterPinch of vanilla sugar ~1/8 teaspoon agar powder (you may need to experiment a bit to attain desired texture)Measure out the water in a microwaveable measuring cup and add the sugar.  Microwave for 30 seconds and stir until sugar is dissolved.While stirring, sprinkle on the agar powder.  Microwave again for 30 seconds and stir for a minute.  Continue microwave and stirring as needed until the agar is all dissolved, although you'll probably still see clear bits floating around in the water.Carefully pour into your desired molds; pop any bubbles that may appear.  Transfer the molds to the refrigerator and allow to set for several hours or overnight.Carefully unmold the cakes and serve immediately with your desired toppings.Next:  Caramel Apple Cinnamon RollsPreviously:  Mochi Donuts and Pon de RingsTwo Years Ago:  Margherita Pizza"},

What's not to love about a chewy ring of mochi deep fried and sugar glazed?  Then I read one of the comments that mentioned rolling the donut holes into balls and forming a ring out of them to make pon de rings!If you've ever been to Taiwan (or Japan, Korea, and probably other parts of Asia) I'm sure you've seen the ubiquitous Mister Donuts and their almost-too-cute-to-eat pon de rings.  They're made out of a chewier dough than their regular donuts and shaped like their mascot Pon de Lion's mane.Instead of rolling the donut holes into the balls, I took the scraps left over from cutting out the regular donut shapes and rolled them into a long snake.  Then I just cut off inch-long pieces and rolled them much like I do when making tang yuan.  I found that the balls stuck together pretty well, but for extra insurance, I lightly wet them at the point that they touched each other to make sure they wouldn't fall apart when frying.  I also used the pro-tip in the comments and assembled them on a square of parchment paper.  You can place the whole thing, pon de ring and paper, into the oil and remove the paper once it's loose.  So genius!I think this may be one of the cutest things I've ever made.  It also helps to have a super talented friend named NoNo draw Pon de Lion for you so you can take a picture of the cutest donut lion ever.  ^_^  (I won't mention our other friend who couldn't be bothered to get up from the couch to see it herself and just waited for us to post the pictures to Instagram.  Although to redeem herself, she did comment that these tasted as good as they looked.)Mochi Donuts and Pon de Rings (adapted from Lady and Pups)makes about 10-14 donuts and/or pon de ringsFor the starter dough:1/4 cup glutinous rice flour3 tablespoons whole milkFor the donut: 1 3/4 cup glutinous rice flour1/2 cup whole milk2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted1/4 cup granulated sugar1 large egg1 teaspoon baking powderVegetable oil For the sugar glaze:    2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted1 cup powdered sugar1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract2-3 tablespoons of hot waterMix 1/4 cup of the glutinous rice flour and 3 tablespoons of whole milk together in a microwave-proof bowl.  Microwave on high for 30 seconds and check to see if the dough is cooked through, which will look opaque and feel very “bouncy”.  Set aside to cool for 5 min.Meanwhile, add 1 3/4 cup of glutinous rice flour, 1/2 cup of milk, melted butter, granulated sugar, egg, and baking powder in a stand-mixer bowl with dough-hook.  Add the cooled starter-dough and knead the mixture on low until everything comes roughly together, then increase the speed to medium and knead until the starter dough has completely blended into the mixture.Scrape the dough onto a surface that’s dusted more glutinous rice flour.  Sprinkle just enough glutinous rice flour onto the dough to prevent sticking, then roll it to 1/2″ thick.  With a well-floured cutter, cut as many donuts out as you can (I was able to get ten 3-inch donuts using a mason jar lid ring and a water bottle cap).To make the pon de rings, gather the scraps, mash them together, and roll into a long snake, about 3/4\" thick.  Cut the snake into 1\" pieces and roll all the pieces into balls.  On pieces of square parchment paper, arrange 8 of the balls together to form a ring.  Using your finger, dab a bit of water over where each of the balls touch their neighbor.  Allow to rest while you heat up the oil.Add enough vegetable oil to a pot to reach 1 1/2″ deep and set on medium-high heat to bring the oil to 330ºF, then turn the heat down to medium-low.  If you don’t have a thermometer, just insert a wooden chopstick into the oil; if small bubbles form around the chopstick quickly, the oil is ready.To fry the donuts, carefully lower a few donuts into the oil; they will sink to the bottom for the first 20 seconds then float back up.  Fry for a few minutes on each side until the donuts are puffed up and golden brown.  Transfer to a cooling rack set over a tray lined with paper towels to drain.To fry the pon de rings, lower the rings along with the parchment paper into the hot oil.  After 20-30 seconds, you should be able to separate the paper from the ring.  Remove the paper with tongs and discard.  Once the rings are golden brown on both sides, transfer to the cooling rack to drain.Mix 2 1/2 tablespoons of melted unsalted butter with powdered sugar and vanilla extract, then add 2-3 tablespoons of hot water to bring it to a desired glaze-consistency.  Dip one side of the donuts into the glaze and serve within a few hours.  (I didn't mix my glaze well enough so there were still quite a few sugar lumps in it when I dipped the donuts; I like to think of them as accidental pearl sugar decorations ;)If you end up with leftovers, you should heat them up before eating so the soft, chewy texture is restored.  Ten seconds in the microwave works, but my preferred way of reheating a mochi donut is to use a waffle iron.  This way you get the chewiness but also a crispier crust.  It's like a moffle, only better!Next:  Raindrop Cake Previously:  Faux PhởLast Year:  Kaddo (Afghan Pumpkin with Tomato and Yogurt Sauces)Two Years Ago:  The Famouse Butter Tomato Sauce"},
{"title": "Faux Phở", "date": "Monday, October 27, 2014", "text": "I'm ashamed to admit that I didn't have my first phở until maybe 3 or 4 years ago.  Every time I went to a Vietnamese restaurant before that fateful day, I'd always ordered the bún with fried spring rolls and roast pork because, let's face it, fried spring rolls are delicious.  But then one day I was with some friends who were determined to go to Turtle Tower for what was supposed to be the best chicken phở in San Francisco, so I figured I might as well try what they were famous for.  Suffice it to say, I realized I how much I had been missing out.Since then, I've discovered that I prefer beef-based phở, especially with veggie and tofu toppings.  To try to recreate phở at home, I mostly followed this recipe from The Kitchn for a vegetarian phở but used beef broth and fish sauce instead of the vegetable broth and soy sauce.  I guess you could call it a faux phở (and in case you were wondering, phở is pronounced as if you were saying the first part of a very bad word).  The result is pretty close to what I'm used to, but definitely no where close to what you'd get from making your own broth from beef bones.  I also noticed the distinct lack of MSG, which I would've added if I had any.One of the first things you do in this recipe is char an onion and ginger over an open flame.  If you don't have a gas stove, you can also get the same type of result under a broiler.  Don't be afraid of getting them a bit burnt; that's the point.  You'll end up peeling off the burnt parts, anyways, revealing the softened, aromatic insides before adding it to the broth.  For the protein, I pressed, marinated, and baked some firm tofu similar to how I made the baked tofu for the soba noodle salad, but this time, I only baked it on each side for 10 minutes so that it was a bit softer.Faux Phở (adapted from The Kitchn)serves 2-3Broth:1 large onion2-inch piece of fresh ginger3-inch cinnamon stick1 star anise2 cloves1 teaspoon coriander seeds6 cups beef broth (you could also use vegetable or chicken broth)2 carrots, peeled and coarsely chopped2 celery stalks, coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons fish sauce or soy sauce2 tablespoons rock sugar or granulated sugarSalt, to taste Noodles: 1/2 lb. dried flat rice noodlesToppings:Fried or baked tofuMushroomsVegetables such as baby bok choy or broccoli crowns, steamed or blanchedGarnishes:1/2 onion, very thinly sliced1 lime, cut into wedges1/2 cup bean sprouts1 chile pepper (Thai bird, serrano, or jalapeno), sliced2 scallions, thinly sliced Large handful of herbs:  cilantro, Thai basil, saw-leaf herbSriracha and/or hoisin sauceChar the onion and ginger over an open flame or directly under a broiler until slightly blackened.  Allow to cool.In a large pot, dry roast the cinnamon, star anise, cloves, and coriander over medium-low heat, stirring to prevent burning.  When the spices are aromatic, add the water or broth, carrots, celery, fish sauce, and rock sugar.When the onion and ginger are cool enough to handle, peel both, slice in half, and add to the broth.  Bring the broth to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 30 minutes.  Strain and keep hot until ready to serve, reserving the carrot slices for topping the noodles, if you like.While the broth is simmering, place the noodles in a large bowl and cover with very hot water.  Let stand for 20-30 minutes or until tender but still chewy.  Drain.  (If soaking does not soften the noodles enough, blanch them in a pot of boiling water for a few seconds).Divide noodles among the serving bowls.  Taste the broth and add salt, if necessary.  You want the broth to be almost too salty, since the noodles and toppings haven't been cooked with any salt.  Pour the broth into each bowl.  Add the toppings and serve with the garnishes on the side.Next:  Mochi Donuts and Pon de Rings Previously:  Nigel Slater's Chocolate Beet CakeTwo Years Ago:  Miso Marinated Black Cod"},
{"title": "Nigel Slater's Chocolate Beet Cake", "date": "Thursday, October 23, 2014", "text": "Everyone once in a while I'll look at my Boston Organics no-list and decide to update it so I can try something new.  That happened last week with beets.  I ended up getting 4 beets and no idea what to do with them after I remembered I don't particularly like beets, which is why they were on the no-list to begin with.  Sigh.  When my friend, Evelyn, suggested that I make red velvet cake I looked up a couple of recipes but didn't feel like making a cream cheese frosting to go along with it.  Then I found Nigel Slater's genius recipe for an extremely moist Chocolate Beet Cake on Food52.  I was sold.The directions are a little fussy (boiling the beets whole and then peeling after they're cooked, not stirring the chocolate while it's melting, etc.) but I pretty much followed them to a T except I did add the sugar gradually into the egg whites while they were being beaten instead of folding it in afterwards.  Since folding something into egg whites is already such a precarious operation and beating sugar into egg whites helps to stabilize the whites, I figured it was a win-win situation.  I also decided I didn't want to risk dyeing my food processor bright pink and just grated the cooked beets into a coarse purée using a box grater, which David Lebovitz suggested in his post about this same recipe.  While this recipe isn't the quickest or simplest, I agree with David when he says that it tastes better the second day (or even the third, if it lasts that long), so you can totally make this the day before you need it if you're in a time crunch.Two words of caution:  make sure you do not overmix the batter and make sure you don't overbake.  Overmixing will cause you to lose the precious air pockets you created when whipping the egg whites.  This is what keeps the cake from being a dense brick.  Also, if you overbake the cake, you'll lose all the delicious moistness from the beets.  Since I didn't have any crème fraîche (who does?!) I topped my cake with Greek yogurt instead.  I imagine sour cream, coconut whipped cream, or a good vanilla ice cream would work just as well.  And since I didn't have any poppy seeds on hand, I sprinkled on some pomegranate arils instead.  I like how the pomegranate echoed the color of the beets used in the cake and also enhanced the tartness of the Greek yogurt.Nigel Slater's Chocolate Beet Cake (from Food52)serves 88 ounces fresh beets7 ounces fine dark chocolate (70%)1/4 cup hot espresso3/4 cup + 2 tablespoons butter1 cup + 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder3 tablespoons good quality cocoa powder5 eggsScant 1 cup superfine sugarCrème fraîche or Greek yogurtPoppy seeds or pomegranate arils, to serveLightly butter an 8-inch springform cake pan and line the base with a round of parchment paper. Heat the oven to 350°F.    Cook the beets, whole and unpeeled, in boiling unsalted water. Depending on their size, they will be tender within 30 to 40 minutes. Young ones may take slightly less. Drain them, let them cool under running water, then peel them, slice off their stem and root, and grate or process in a blender or food processor until a coarse purée.    Melt the chocolate, broken into small pieces, in a small bowl set over a pot of simmering water. Don’t stir.    When the chocolate looks almost melted, pour the hot espresso over it and stir once. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the melted chocolate. Push the butter down under the surface of the chocolate with a spoon (as best you can) and leave to soften.    Sift together the flour, baking powder, and cocoa. Separate the eggs, putting the whites in a large mixing bowl. Beat the yolks together.    Remove the bowl of chocolate from the heat and stir until the butter has melted into the chocolate. Let sit for a few minutes, then stir in the egg yolks. Do this quickly, mixing firmly and evenly so the eggs blend into the mixture instead of cooking. Fold in the beets.Whisk the egg whites until they form soft peaks, then add the sugar gradually as you continue to whip until all the sugar has been incorporated and the egg whites form stiff peaks. Fold the beaten egg whites into the chocolate mixture and then fold in the flour and cocoa.    Transfer quickly to the prepared cake pan and put in the oven, decreasing the heat immediately to 325°F. Bake for 40 minutes. The rim of the cake will feel spongy, the inner part should still wobble a little when gently shaken. Test with a cake tester or toothpick too -- if it is still gooey in the center, continue baking just until moist crumbs cling to the tester.    Set the cake aside to cool, loosening it around the edges with a thin icing spatula after half an hour or so. It is not a good idea to remove the cake from its pan until it is completely cold. Serve in thick slices, with crème fraîche or Greek yogurt and poppy seeds or pomegranate arils.This cake is definitely on the less sweet side, and because I used the coarse grater to process the cooked beets, there were several moist chunks of beets laced throughout the cake, which I didn't mind.  Other than that, if no one had told me there were beets in this cake, I probably would never have guessed.  If you want to get rid of all traces of beets in this cake, you'll probably want a finer purée.Next:  Faux PhởPreviously:  Elote-Style Cornbread WafflesTwo Years Ago:  Coconut Whipped Cream and Coconut Dulce de Leche"},

In a separate bowl, blend together the dry ingredients, then quickly and gently combine the wet and dry ingredients. Let the batter sit for 10 minutes, to allow the cornmeal to soften.In the meantime, mix the mayo, minced garlic, and lime juice together.  Add cayenne pepper, chili powder, paprika, and sriracha (if using) to taste.  Drop the batter by 1/3-cupfuls onto a hot waffle iron and bake until the waffle iron stops steaming.  Top with the spicy mayonnaise and crumbled cheese.  Sprinkle on more cayenne pepper and/or chile powder as desired, and serve with lime wedges.The waffles are best fresh out of the waffle iron because they start to get soft once they get to room temperature.  You can always reheat them in the oven to get them to crisp up again.  Since I was making these for a lot of people, I ended up cutting each waffle into eighths and serving them nacho-style.  If you have the corn-shaped pans for making cornbread sticks, I think it would be really cute to dress those up elote-style as well!

{"title": "Concord Grape Sorbet", "date": "Monday, October 6, 2014", "text": "I mentioned in my last post that my main purpose on my most recent trip to Italy was to eat as much good gelato as I could.  I wasn't joking.  I think the first 9 pictures I shared from the trip were just pictures of all the gelato I was eating.I started off in Rome with a rice, sesame, and chestnut honey gelato from Il Gelato di Claudio Torce.  I learned later from my cousin that the little cone on top is actually supposed to be used as an edible spoon.  So cute!Next I wandered into the Trastavere neighborhood for a bit of Fior di Luna's Concord grape sorbetto and fig gelato.  The Concord grape flavor was perfect but overwhelmed the more subtle fig.Lastly, I stopped by my all time favorite gelateria in Rome, Gelateria del Teatro for their chocolate orange and my favorite flavor, honey rosemary lemon.  In Florence, I tried the panna cotta with caramel at Il Triangolo delle Bermuda (where I also had the ribollita).Right next to the Ponte Vecchio is Gelateria delle Carrozze, where I tried their strawberry and coconut gelato.  Both were very true to flavor.The next day we stopped by Carabé in between the Accademia and the Duomo for a scoop of pistachio.After lunch at Cantinetta dei Verrazzano, we went across the street to Perché No? (which means \"why not?\") for a chocolate sorbet and mint gelato.The last gelato of the day was an amaretto from Carapina, which ended up being my favorite in Florence because of the texture.  I love that real Italian gelato is kept at a temperature just above freezing so it's always soft and easy to scoop.  Coincidentally, we just happened to be in Florence the same time as the gelato festival!  After having 5 gelatos for dinner the following day, I was officially done with gelato for a while.  (I didn't have my next scoop until several days later after a 2 hour hike between Monterosso and Vernazza in Cinque Terre!) Out of all these, the flavor that impressed me the most was the Concord grape sorbetto from Fior di Luna.  I remember trying the Concord grape flavor from San Crispino the year before and not being very impressed, but this time it was the complete opposite.  The sorbet totally captured the full burst of flavor you get when biting into a Concord grape without all the hassle of having to spit out the seeds and skin afterward.  Luckily, Concord grape season is upon us, so I was able to get a couple of quarts from the supermarket to try to recreate the sorbet.I basically followed the recipe from Gourmet, but instead of adding the full amount of sugar, I started with 1/4 cup, which ended up being enough for me.  Depending on how much purée you end up with and how sweet your grapes are, you'll want to adjust the amount of sugar; it should taste just a little too sweet at room temperature since once it's frozen it'll taste less sweet.  To add a little depth to the sorbet I added a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of red wine, which also helps keep the sorbet from getting too icy.Concord Grape Sorbet (adapted from Gourmet)makes about 3 cups2 quarts Concord grapes, destemmed1/4 cup sugar, plus more, to taste1 pinch salt1 tablespoon red winePurée half of grapes in a blender until smooth, then force through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, discarding solids.  (If you have a very powerful blender like a Vitamix, you probably don't want to blend on high since you want the seeds to stay whole.)Repeat with remaining grapes to yield 3 cups purée. (I ended up with a little more than 2 cups.)  Whisk in sugar, salt, and red wine.  Taste and add more sugar if necessary, just until the mixture is a little too sweet at room temperature.  Chill until very cold, 3 to 6 hours.Freeze in ice cream maker, then transfer to an airtight container and put in freezer to firm up, at least 2 hours. You can also pour the frozen churned sorbet into popsicle molds to make really awesome Concord grape popsicles!Next:  Indonesian Avocado MilkshakePreviously:  Ribollita (Tuscan Bread Soup)Last Year:  Apple Cider DonutsTwo Years Ago:  Magical Cold Brew Coffee"},
{"title": "Ribollita (Tuscan Bread Soup)", "date": "Friday, September 26, 2014", "text": "I was lucky enough to go back to Italy again for the third time in 15 months thanks to my cousin, Leslie.  Last time we did Rome and Venice; this time we explored Florence, northern Tuscany (pictured above) and Cinque Terre and were joined by my friend, Sarah Ruth.My main purpose in Florence was to eat as much good gelato as I possibly could.  To that effect, our first stop after checking into our hotel was to go to Triangolo delle Bermuda to try their artisanal gelato.  Once we realized they also served food, I figured it would be better to eat lunch before getting our gelato, so I ordered the ribollita, a soup I'd heard was a Tuscan specialty.Ribollita translates to \"reboiled\" and is a result of reheating leftover minestrone-like soup with stale bread to create a thick, hearty potage.  I've read there's actually a three day process where on the second day you layer the leftover soup with the bread and bake it with a layer of thinly sliced red onions on top and then reboil it on the third day.  For simplicity's sake, I skipped the second day and jumped straight to the reboiling.Since ribollita is originally peasant food, there's a multitude of recipes for it (some even argue that since it was created before the advent of tomatoes in Italy, there shouldn't be any tomatoes in it), but traditionally the main ingredients are always cavolo nero (also called lacinato kale or Tuscan kale), cannellini beans, and stale Tuscan bread.  Since I had recently received collard greens in my Boston Organics delivery, I opted to use that instead of the cavolo nero, which I realize is taking great liberties with the dish, but it still ended up tasting really good, if with a slight Southern twist.   You can also another hearty green (like kale or Savoy cabbage) or a combination of a hearty green and a more delicate green (like Swiss chard or spinach).I learned that Tuscan bread traditionally doesn't contain any salt because the city-state of Pisa used to control the salt trade in that region, and the Florentines hated the Pisans.  I found a loaf of bread labelled \"Tuscan bread\" at my local grocery store, but when I looked at the label, I wasn't surprised to see salt listed in the ingredients.  It'll probably be impossible to find a loaf of bread without salt in it outside of Tuscany, so just use a hearty, country-style bread.Back to the ribollita at Triangolo delle Bermuda:  the owner, Vitullio, stopped by to talk to us and explained that the soup needed to be topped with some Tuscan olive oil.  He grabbed a green bottle and liberally poured some all over my bowl.  I took a bite, and and it was like the heavens had opened and I could hear harp music playing.  I had never, ever tasted olive oil like that.  It was bold and bright and fruity and really elevated the other flavors in the soup.  I asked Vitullio for the brand so I could buy that exact bottle, but I think he misunderstood because he just started telling us about the Toscano IGP designation for olive oils and how important it was to buy olive oils with that label.  Alas, I never did find out which brand of olive oil that was, but I was now on the hunt for official Toscano IGP olive oils.A few days later, I went on a truffle hunting and wine tasting tour, which if you ever get the chance, you should definitely do!  We spent the first part of the tour following Ciocco (short for cioccolata), the truffle hunting puppy, around a hazelnut grove.  He managed to find 5 black summer truffles, which were used in our \"light lunch\" back at the farm.  The \"light lunch\" turned out to be a three course meal with a splendid antipasto plate, a main course of truffle pasta, dessert, and lots and lots of local wine.Afterwards, we drove to Fattoria di San Michele a Torri, an organic farm and winery in the Chianti region, for the wine tasting.  We started off with one of their olive oils, which although beautifully bottled, was way too grassy and spicy for me.  I realized that not all olive oils made in Tuscany were going to taste the same and decided I was going to have to taste test the olive oil before I bought one.Luckily, I had a chance to do so in the town of Vinci (Leonardo's birthplace).  I ended up picking up this Santini, which although fruity, was a little milder than I remember that first olive oil being.  All this is to say that not all olive oils are the same, and you should try to find one that you really like to use as a finishing oil.Ribollita (Tuscan Bread Soup)serves 63 tablespoons olive oil1 large onion, chopped2 carrots, chopped2 celery stalks, chopped2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced1 tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped28 oz. can of whole, peeled tomatoes1 lb. cavolo nero, or a combination of kale, Savoy cabbage, collard greens, Swiss chard, and/or spinach, de-ribbed and sliced16 oz. can of cannellini beans, drained3 cups waterKosher salt and fresh ground pepper 8 slices of day old Tuscan bread, crusts removedGood quality extra virgin olive oil, to finishDay 1:  In a large Dutch oven or saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the chopped onion, carrots, celery, and a pinch of salt and cook until the onion is soft and translucent, about 10-15 minutes.  If the vegetables start to brown, lower the heat.  Add the garlic, thyme, and another pinch of salt and cook for another minute or two, until fragrant.Add the tomatoes and their juices and the sliced greens.  Bring to a boil and keep stirring until the greens are wilted and cooked down.  Add the beans and enough water to just cover all the vegetables, about 3 cups.  Bring to a boil and then lower the heat and simmer until all the vegetables are tender.  Salt and pepper to taste.  You can serve the soup at this point with some fresh Tuscan bread.  Refrigerate the remaining soup.Day 2:  Tear the bread into small pieces and add to the soup.  Bring to a boil again, and then simmer for 30 minutes, stirring to dissolve the bread into the soup.  It should be thick enough that you can stand a wooden spoon in the soup.  Ladle the soup into bowls and drizzle with a generous amount of your favorite finishing olive oil.I've also read about Ribollita \"Da Delfina\" where they make a super thick ribollita and then form patties out of the soup and pan-fry them.  I tried doing that with my ribollita on day 3, but it was still a little too watery to keep its shape when I tried to flip the patties.  Still, it was an interesting experiment, distilling all the flavors of the soup into a solid form with the added dimension of the caramelization that occurs during the frying.Previously:  Hokkaido Milk Bread Three Ways

Hokkaido Milk Bread Three Ways (Traditional, Braided, and Taro Swirl) (adapted from Lady and Pups)makes 2 loavesFor first proofing:600 grams bread flour42 grams egg white7 grams yeast168 grams heavy cream190 grams whole milk12 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature18 grams of sugarFor second proofing:7 grams salt5 grams yeast90 grams sugar50 grams egg whites3 grams milk powder12 grams unsalted butter, at room temperatureTo finish:40 grams butterKosher salt1 eggCombine the heavy cream, whole milk, butter, and sugar and warm it in the microwave to 110°F.  In a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment, combine the bread flour, yeast, egg whites, and warm milk mixture.  Knead until smooth on medium speed.  Cover and proof in the refrigerator for 18-24 hours until doubled.Once the dough has doubled, punch out the air.  Cut the dough into small \"bite-size\" pieces and return it to the stand mixer.  Add the salt, yeast, sugar, and egg whites and turn the mixture on medium.  Work the dough until smooth and elastic (about 5 minutes), then add the butter.  Keep the mixer on medium and work for another 3 minutes.  Then turn the mixer on medium high and work the dough for another 6-10 minutes.  The dough should pull away from the bowl and make \"slapping sounds\" against the bowl.At this point, the dough shouldn't be too sticky but still moist and have developed enough gluten that you could slowly stretch it into a thin, translucent film without breaking it.  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions and let rest for 30 minutes. In the meantime, brown the 40 grams of butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.  The butter will start to foam, then turn brown and smell nutty.  Turn off the heat and set the browned butter aside.Once the dough is rested, divide each half into 3 equal parts.  Roll each part into an long oval shape, then fold the sides toward the center (like folding a letter) and roll it out again into a long rectangle.  Roll the long rectangle up into a spiral.  Repeat for the other portions and let rest for another 15 minutes.Variation #1:  The traditional way is to take the 3 portions and roll each into a long oval.  Brush with the browned butter and sprinkle with a little salt, then roll up into a spiral.  Place the 3 spirals seam side down in a loaf pan.Variation #2:  If you want to make a braided loaf, after brushing on the butter and salt, roll each of the portions lengthwise into a long snake.  Braid the three snakes, tuck the ends underneath, and set into a loaf pan.Variation #3:  For the taro swirl bread, shape the dough the traditional way, but instead of brushing with butter and salt, spread a thin layer of sweetened taro paste on top of the long oval before rolling up into a spiral.At this point, you can freeze the shaped dough if you want and just let it come to room temperature before moving on when you're ready to bake the bread. Preheat the oven to 360°F.  Let the dough proof to 80% full (not doubled, which would be 100%); this will probably take 60-90 minutes.  Make an egg wash by beating the egg with a tablespoon of water.  Once the dough is proofed, brush the top with the egg wash and cover with aluminum foil.  Bake for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and back another 10-20 minutes until golden brown on top.While the braided loaf turned out pretty well, I was a little disappointed with the final look of the traditional loaf (see the second picture from the top).  I think since I used a flexible silicon loaf pan, the bread expanded outwards instead of just up so it ended up not rising as high as I would've liked it to.  However, I liked the texture of the traditional loaf more because if you look at the cross sections of the two loaves, the traditional one has a much fluffier, almost stringy (in a good way) consistency.  This is due to the way it is shaped, hence, the reason it is more traditional.I also noticed that the bottom of my first loaf (third picture down) was pretty brown by the time I took it out of the oven, so for my next loaf I baked it on top of one of those AirBake cookie sheets, and it turned out much better.Next:  Ribollita (Tuscan Bread Soup) Previously:  Ginger Scallion Lobster BunsLast Year:  Sweet Corn Ice Cream with Black Raspberry Swirl"},

(Although you may be tempted to use a nonstick pan, a stainless steel pan will produce a more beautiful caramelized exterior.)Sprinkle the scallops lightly with salt and add them to the pan, without crowding. (If necessary, cook the scallops in two pans or in 2 batches; if they touch, they will steam rather than caramelize.) Cook, without moving the scallops, until the bottoms are a rich golden brown, 2 1/2 - 3 minutes. Turn the scallops and caramelize the second side.Transfer the scallops to a serving platter and serve with a squeeze of lemon juice on top, if desired.Previously: Melanzane alla Parmigiana (Eggplant Parmesan)Last Year:  Brown Butter Vinaigrette Lobster Buns"},

Sear on the stovetop over medium heat until golden brown on the bottom, about 3 minutes.  Turn the fish over, put the pan in the oven, and cook another 2 to 3 minutes, until a metal skewer can be easily inserted into the center of the fillet and, if left for 5 seconds, feels just warm when touched to your lip.  Remove from the oven, turn the fillets over again, and brush with the teriyaki sauce.  Garnish with chopped scallions and sesame seeds and serve immediately.Next:  Salt and Pepper TofuPreviously:  Bill Smith's Atlantic Beach PieLast Year:  Mozzarella Stuffed Arancini (Risotto Balls)"},

{"title": "Jacques Genin's Mango Passion Caramels", "date": "Tuesday, August 5, 2014", "text": "A year and a half ago, I tried making my own version of Jacques Genin's mango passion caramels by using Smitten Kitchen's apple cider caramels as a template.  In my opinion, the vanilla passion caramels turned out great, and everyone was happy.Then a couple of months ago, my friend Ellen sent me a link to this recipe which linked to what was apparently the real recipe from Jacques Genin.  o_OUnfortunately, even after translating the recipe to English, the instructions were a little vague.  There no mention of what temperature to cook the caramel to, just directions to boil for 45 minutes, which is really not enough when it comes to the precise science of candy making.  And there was no helpful suggestion for how to replace the glucose with corn syrup, which is much more available, at least in my kitchen.  Lastly, the recipe says it's for 4 people, but the crazy amount of each ingredient (a kilogram each of mango and passion fruit juice?  1.8 kilograms of sugar?!?) made me think it might be for more like 400 people!  After reading a few comments and looking up some info online, I decided to try cooking the caramel to a \"soft ball\" stage, about 110°C or 230°F, and to use a 1:1 substitution of corn syrup for glucose.  I also made the executive decision to divide all the quantities by 5.The caramel actually reached 230°F in about 45 minutes on a medium-low heat, so I thought I had gotten it right (and the volume of caramel was just right), but then when it was time to cut the caramels, they were so soft it was almost impossible!  I basically had to scrape the caramel onto a piece of wax paper, and even after chilling the caramels in the freezer, they were still super soft!  In the end, I gave up on trying to wrap this batch and just spooned everything into a jar.  It wasn't a total loss, though.  I made banana pancakes the next morning and topped them with the mango passion caramel sauce, and it was delicious!  I'm thinking of swirling the rest into some coconut ice cream, whenever I get around to making that.I was determined to get the caramels right though, so for the next batch I decided to use half the amount of corn syrup and to cook the caramels until 252°F, the temperature I used for the vanilla passion caramels.  This time, the caramels set like they should!  The only problem is the butter didn't completely mix into the caramel even though I stirred it for like 15 minutes!  The next time I make these, I'll try reducing the amount of butter I add by maybe 20%.Other than that, these caramels were perfect.  They're soft but not sticky with just the tiniest bit of crackle from the vanilla bean seeds.  The reduction in corn syrup made a difference not only in texture but also in improving the taste.  There's less of a sharp sweetness so you can taste the tartness of the fruit and the buttery goodness even more.  It's been over 2 years since I had last the real thing, but this pretty much tastes exactly like what I remember.  ^_^Jacques Genin's Mango Passion Caramels (adapted from here)makes about 64 caramels300 g heavy cream200 g passion fruit pulp200 g mango juice1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and cut in half if needed to fit in the pot25 g corn syrup360 g sugar100 g butter, softened (consider using less; however, I haven't tried it myself)Mix all the ingredients except for the butter in a large saucepan.  Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat to a medium/medium-low and continue to boil for about 45-60 minutes, until the temperature reaches 252°F.   In the meantime, line a 8\" square baking pan with two pieces of crisscrossed parchment paper.  Cut out 3\" square pieces of wax paper to use as wrappers.When the caramel has reached temperature, remove the vanilla bean.  Add the butter and mix well. It may take a while for the butter to mix in, but it eventually will; just keep stirring.Pour into the prepared baking pan and allow to cool completely.Cut the caramel into 1\" squares.  Wrap in the wax paper squares.  Store in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before eating.  Die of happiness.This recipe is actually easier than the vanilla passion caramel one since you only need one pot for everything!  The hardest part was actually finding pure mango juice since most of the \"mango juice\" I found in stores contained water and sugar.  I think I finally found some on a shelf in a random Latin grocery store in Seattle.  I found the passion fruit pulp in the freezer section of my grocery store with all the other frozen Goya products.Next:  Sea Salt Cold Brew CoffeePreviously:  Grace's Ginger Scallion FishLast Year:  Matcha Mochi Cupcakes"},

Pro-tip:  Don't throw out the scallion roots after you've chopped off the green part!  Put them in some water and leave them in a sunny place.  They'll start regrowing, and you can get a lot more mileage out of them.  The picture below shows how much they grew in only 5 days!  That's enough to make some tomato and eggs over rice.  =)Next:  Jacques Genin's Mango Passion Caramels Previously:  Strawberry Pop Tart Slab PieLast Year:  Cold Soba Noodle Salad with Bake Tofu and Edamame, S'mores Brownie Ice Cream Sandwiches"},
{"title": "Strawberry Pop Tart Slab Pie", "date": "Wednesday, July 30, 2014", "text": "Ever since I saw this post for a S'mores Pop Tart slab pie, I just knew I had to make my own version of a frosted strawberry Pop Tart!  Can you think of anything more fun and delightful than a huge slab pie filled with jammy fresh strawberries, glazed, and topped with rainbow sprinkles?  I didn't think so.  One pro-tip for making this pie is to use parchment paper.  You can use it to figure out how large to roll the dough out to just by creasing the paper inside the baking pan first.  You can also use it to easily transport the rolled out dough to the refrigerator and into the baking pan.  Lastly, it makes it super easy to remove the pie from the pan and totally saves time on clean up!I didn't use all the glaze because I didn't want the pie to be too sickeningly sweet, but it also meant I didn't get a nice opaque frosting on top, which would have looked more authentic.  To make it super authentic, I'd also glaze one of the shorter sides of the pie all the way to the edge since my Pop Tarts always seem to be unevenly frosted like that. Strawberry Pop Tart Slab Pieserves 10-12 (although I served it to a small group of 5, and we pretty much demolished it)For the crust:2 1/2 cups flour3 tablespoons sugar1 teaspoon kosher salt1 cup cold unsalted butter (2 sticks), cubed1/4 cup ice water, more as neededFor the filling:1 lb. fresh strawberries1/2 cup vanilla or granulated sugar2 tablespoons cornstarchPinch of kosher saltJuice from 1/2 lemonFor the glaze:1 cup confectioner's sugar2 tablespoons milkRainbow sprinkles!Mix the flour, sugar, and salt together in a food processor.  Add the butter and pulse until the butter has been cut into pea-sized pieces.  Add the water and pulse to combine.  Add more water if needed, a tablespoon at a time, just until the dough comes together.  Divide the dough in two, wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight.Preheat the oven to 400°F. Tear off two large pieces of parchment paper and tuck each into a 9\" x 13\" baking pan, creasing along the sides and corners so you know how large to roll the dough.  One at a time, roll out the two pieces of dough to about 10\" x 14\" on the parchment paper.  It's okay if it's not perfect since you'll be tucking the sides over and under.  You can cut off any excess pieces and patch up other corners or cracks if needed, too.  Transfer the rolled out dough on the parchment paper back to the refrigerator while you prepare the filling.Wash, hull, and thinly slice the strawberries.  Toss with the sugar, cornstarch, salt, and lemon juice.Tuck one of the rolled out crusts with the parchment paper into the baking pan, making sure there is enough dough on all sides to form a rim.  Spread the strawberry filling evenly over the crust.  Top with the other rolled out pie crust.  Carefully crimp together the edges and fold the excess dough over and under the edge, lifting up the parchment paper underneath to help with this process.  If there was a lot of extra dough, you can trim it off, but you want to make sure the filling is sealed inside.Use a fork to prick the top crust evenly all around.  Bake for 20 minutes.Check to make sure that the holes you made are still open (sometimes they shrink and seal up), and if not, prick again with a fork.  Rotate and return to the oven for another 20 minutes or until golden brown.Make the glaze in the meantime by mixing together the confectioner's sugar and milk. Allow the pie to cool before using the parchment paper as a sling to remove it from the pan and onto a large cutting board.  Spread the glaze over the pie, leaving a 1/2\" border.  Immediately top with the rainbow sprinkles.The pie actually reminded me a little more of a Toaster Strudel than a Pop Tart, which isn't a bad thing.  Oooh, now to make a gigantic Toaster Strudel with puff pastry and cream cheese frosting....Next:  Grace's Ginger Scallion FishPreviously:  Ginger Beer SherbetLast Year:  Oven Fried Mac 'n' Cheese Pizza"},

{"title": "New England Clambake at Home", "date": "Thursday, July 24, 2014", "text": "After making a low country boil, I couldn't not also do a clambake!  A traditional New England clambake involves digging a pit in the sand, building a fire, adding rocks to the pit, covering them with seaweed, layering on the food, and then covering it all up with a tarp and waiting forever for it all to cook through.  It's something I'd love to do someday, but in the meantime, here's how to do it much more easily at home (and much quicker, too!).I pretty much followed this recipe from Bon Appétit, except I tried using a couple of different types of clams:  littlenecks, cherrystones, and steamers.  I decided I like littlenecks the best; the steamers were too sandy, even after letting them spit out sand in cornmeal and salt water bath, and the cherrystones were just too big and chewy.  I really only got the cherrystones, which I learned are just older, bigger littlenecks, because they were on sale for 99¢/lb!I like how this recipe cooks the lobster first instead of steaming them at the end on top of all the other food.  My 7-quart stockpot definitely wouldn't have fit two lobsters on top of the rest of the food, and the thought of having to hold the lid down on even just one live lobster in a pot of steaming water is too much for me to deal with.  I was actually hoping to have the store just steam them for me (most grocery stores will do so for free), but there was a long wait for them to be steamed, so I just ended up doing it myself.  Since you use the water that you cook the lobsters in to cook the rest of the food, it ends up being a nice, flavorful broth that you can serve with the rest of the clambake. I use the broth to dip the clam meat in to rinse off any last bits of sand before I pop it into my mouth.New England Clambake at Home (adapted from Bon Appétit)serves 44 dozen littleneck clams (or a mix of littlenecks and steamers), scrubbed1/4 cup yellow cornmealKosher saltFresh ground pepper 1 lemon, sliced into rounds 1 large onion, peeled and quartered2 celery stalks, cut in half6 large fresh parsley sprigs6 fresh thyme sprigs2 small dried bay leaves1/4 teaspoon whole black peppercorns2 live lobsters, 1 to 1 1/2 lb. each2 lbs. small red potatoes4 ears of corn, husked and halved14 oz. kielbasa links, halved1 1/2 sticks butter3 large garlic cloves, finely chopped1 teaspoon dried oregano1 teaspoon dried basilLemon wedges, for serving Place the clams and cornmeal in a very large bowl and fill with enough cold, salted water to cover.  Set aside for at least 30 minutes and up to an hour for the clams to spit up excess sand.Fill a stock pot about a quarter of the way with cold water and bring to a boil over high heat.  Add one lobster headfirst and cover.  Cook for 10 minutes, until done, and transfer to a large platter or rimmed baking sheet.  Repeat with the other lobster.Add the potatoes and quartered onion to the pot and bring to a boil.  Cover and cook for 10 minutes. Layer the sausages and corn on top of the vegetables and cover again, cooking for another 10 minutes.Rinse the clams thoroughly and add on top of the corn and sausages (if there isn't enough room in the pot, you can remove the corn, which should be cooked through).  Cover the pot tightly and boil until the clams open, about 12 minutes.In the meantime, melt the butter in a small saucepan and add the garlic, oregano and basil.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.With a slotted spoon, transfer the clams, corn, sausage, and potatoes to the baking sheet with the lobsters.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper and garnish with lemon wedges.  Strain the broth and pour into 4 soup cups.  Serve seasoned butter and broth alongside the vegetables, sausages, and seafood.The next time I make this, I'll probably try reducing the amount of water in the pot, and adding some white wine or beer to steam the food with and add more flavor to the broth.Next:  Ginger Beer SherbetPreviously:  Taiwanese Grilled CornLast Year:  Vanilla Sugar Lemonade and Mint Lemonade Slushies, Martha Stewart's Perfect Macaroni and Cheese"},
{"title": "Taiwanese Style Street Corn", "date": "Thursday, July 17, 2014", "text": "I have to admit that I've never actually had this when I was in Taiwan, but that doesn't really matter.  When I read about Tiny Urban Kitchen's Taiwanese grilled corn, I knew I had to make it.  I already had all the ingredients for the sauce, and corn was on sale for 12 for $1.97 at Stop and Shop!  All I was missing was a grill.  Luckily, my friends Evie and Santi had a cookout at their place over the weekend, so it all worked out.After my experience with making Mexican grilled corn, I decided to par-cook the corn before grilling it.  I've wanted to try the microwave shucking method ever since I saw this video, so I figured I could use the microwave to kill two birds with one stone.I like to make the basting sauce the night before so that the garlic has time to really release a lot of its juices.  Make sure you use soy paste and sweet chili sauce, not soy sauce or another hot sauce.  (See this picture from Tiny Urban Kitchen for the brands we both used.)  You really want the thickness and sweetness from using those two specific sauces for this recipe.Taiwanese Style Street Corn (adapted from Tiny Urban Kitchen)serves 6-84 tablespoons soy paste1 tablespoon sweet chili sauce4-5 garlic cloves6-8 ears of cornButter (optional)Mix together the soy paste and sweet chili sauce.  Smash the garlic cloves, remove the skin, and add to the sauces.  I like to mash them a bit more in the sauce to really release their juices.  Let sit in the refrigerator overnight, if possible.Cut off the stalk end of each ear of corn.  Microwave one or two at a time for 90 seconds to 2 minutes per corn.  The corn will be really, really hot so make sure you use a dependable oven mitt to remove from the microwave. Holding the stringy end of the corn (and still using oven mitts!) shake and squeeze the corn out of the husk.  It should slide out pretty easily, and you should be able to get it out without any corn silk attached, but if there is any left on the corn, just remove it once the corn has cooled a bit.  This can also be done the night before; just store the par-cooked corn in the refrigerator and bring back to room temperature before grilling the next day.Grill the corn on a hot grill until it starts to char.  Start basting the corn with the sauce and turning them with tongs to get a nice glaze and char all around.  Continue basting until all the sauce is used up.  You can use less, but why would you want to?  Slather with butter before serving, if desired.I actually started basting the corn as soon as they were on the grill instead of waiting for them to char first.  I'm not sure if it made a difference, especially since the corn was already par-cooked so it didn't take too long for it to start charring.  The end result was exactly what I imagined:  sticky, salty, spicy, smoky, garlicky, crunchy, buttery sweetness.  I totally want to try using this sauce on all the things!

{"title": "Cleveland Cassata Cake (Bonus:  In a Jar!)", "date": "Thursday, July 10, 2014", "text": "Growing up in Cleveland, I knew this as \"the really yummy cake with the fresh strawberries.\"  I was aware it had a name, but because I had only heard people say it and never saw it in writing, I always thought it was a \"cascada\" cake.  It was only after leaving Cleveland that I realized you can't get this cake everywhere, which is so, so sad for everyone else in the world.Think of it as the strawberry shortcake of your dreams:  layers of light, moist chiffon filled with fresh strawberries and custard and frosted with whipped cream.  For me, it's the fresh strawberries that really make this cake; they're tossed with just a couple spoonfuls of sugar to release their juices but still stay firm and almost have a little crackle because of the seeds.I pretty much followed this recipe from Sweet Amandine, except I decided to only make a two-layer cake with half the recipe and try to make three-layer cakes-in-a-jar with the other half (similar to my Happiness Cake in a Jar).  For the two-layer cake, I chose to put the strawberries on top of the custard only because I figured it would be easier spreading the strawberries over the custard than the other way around.  Since you're not really spreading around the fillings for the cakes-in-a-jar, and it actually looks nicer for the custard to be seeping into the strawberry layer, I flip flopped it for the jar version.  I also decided to use vanilla sugar in the custard since I like the subtle additional flavoring and confectioner's sugar in the whipped cream.Cleveland Cassata Cake (adapted from Sweet Amandine)makes one 4-layer cake or one 2-layer cake and ten small (8 oz.) jars or twenty small (8 oz.) jarsFor the custard:6 large egg yolks1/2 cup vanilla sugar (or regular sugar if you don't have vanilla sugar)2 cups half and half3 tablespoons cornstarchFor the cake:2 1/4 cups cake flour1 1/4 and 1/4 cups sugar, divided1 tablespoon baking powder1 teaspoon salt3/4 cup cold water1/2 cup vegetable oil1 teaspoon lemon zest1 teaspoon vanilla extract5 large egg yolks at room temperature8 large egg whites at room temperature1/2 teaspoon cream of tartarFor the strawberries:3 pounds strawberries2 tablespoons sugarFor the whipped cream:2 cups chilled heavy cream1 tablespoon confectioner's sugarWhisk together all of the custard ingredients in a saucepan.  Heat over medium-low heat, whisking constantly until thickened.  Turn down the heat if it starts to simmer.  Transfer the custard to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and cool to room temperature.  Transfer to the refrigerator and chill for at least 3 hours, or up to 2 days.Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line the bottoms of two 9\" round cake pans with lightly oiled parchment paper.  Sift or whisk together the flour, 1 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl.In a separate bowl, beat together the yolks, water, oil, lemon zest, and vanilla until smooth. Stir into the flour mixture. In another large bowl beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat on high until the peaks are stiff but not dry.Using a rubber spatula, fold about a quarter of the fluffy egg whites into the egg yolk mixture. Then very gently fold in the remaining whites. As soon as the egg whites are no longer visible, stop folding. Scrape the batter into the prepared cake pans and spread evenly. Bake for approximately 35 minutes or until the top springs back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.In the meantime, hull and slice the strawberries thinly, reserving a few to garnish the top of the cake with.  Sprinkle with the sugar and stir. Allow the strawberries to macerate for 1 hour, giving them a stir every so often. Strain the berries, reserving the released juices.Allow the cakes to cool in their pans on a cooling rack for at least an hour. When completely cool, run a knife around the sides to release the cakes, cover each pan with a wax paper-lined plate, and flip. Gently lift the pans off of the cakes.Carefully slice the cakes in half with a bread knife so you have four layers (or two, depending on how many cakes you made). Place each layer on a wax paper-lined baking sheet or plate. Whip the cream and sugar together until stiff, making sure not to overwhip (or else you'll be making butter!).Place one cake layer on a wax paper-lined baking sheet. Brush with the reserved strawberry juice. Cover with a layer of custard, and then a layer of strawberries. Repeat for the following layers if you are making more than a two-layer cake.Plop the whipped cream on top of the cake.  Use a spatula to spread the whipped cream across the top and then over the sides of the cake.  Top with the reserved strawberries, if you remembered to save any (which I didn't).To make the cakes in a jar, bake the batter in two lightly oiled parchment paper-lined 9\"x13\" cake pans.  Once the cakes are cooled, use the lid of the jar as a template to cut out 10 (I was able to get 11, but 10 is a nicer, round number) circles, making sure to cut slightly inside the outline so that the cake will fit inside the jar.Tear the remaining cake scraps into large crumbs (you will use this for the middle layer of each jar).  Slice each cake circle in half.  Place the bottom half in the bottom of a jar.  Top with a spoonful of the sliced strawberries (including some juices) and then a spoonful of custard.  Tap the jar a few times to make sure everything is settled.  Top with a layer of the cake crumbs and then another layer of the strawberries and custard.  Place the top half of the cake circle on top of the second layer of custard and top it all off with a dollop of whipped cream.I'm not going to lie, making this cake is definitely a labor of love, but well worth it.  When I was finally done and took my first bite, I tasted exactly like childhood. ^_^Next:  Homemade Choco TacosPreviously:  Watermelon Agua Fresca and PopsiclesLast Year:  BLT with Avocado and Basil Mayonnaise"},

{"title": "Shakshuka with Polenta", "date": "Friday, June 27, 2014", "text": "I had shakshuka for the first time in Israel, so when I decided to make dinner for some friends who had just returned from there, it was the first thing I thought of to make.  It's basically eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce, and I posted a pizza version of it before.  Shakshuka is traditionally eaten with bread, but since one of my guests had a gluten sensitivity, so I decided to pair it with polenta instead.  It's one of those pairings that really made me wonder why I didn't think of it before.  The polenta is substantial enough to stand up to the flavorful tomato sauce, but creamy enough so that you can eat everything with a spoon.  And the best part is, I was able to get the timing down so that you can start both roughly around the same time and have them done at about the same time.I based my shakshuka recipe on the one from The New York Times and cooked the polenta using the \"no stir\" instructions from Marcella Hazan (she of the legendary butter tomato sauce fame).  I found that a good way to \"chop\" the canned tomatoes is to take kitchen shears and cut the tomatoes up in the can.  That way you don't have to worry about getting tomato juices dripping and squirting everywhere if you used a cutting board.  I didn't have any cayenne pepper on hand, so I substituted some hot chili powder and red pepper flakes.  I really liked the addition of the feta, but you can leave it out if you want a dairy free dish (just add a little more salt or adobo seasoning to make up for the loss in flavor).Shakshuka with Polenta (adapted from The New York Times)serves 4-66 cups water3 tablespoons olive oil1 large onion, chopped1 large red bell pepper, seeded and chopped1 1/2 cups polenta 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced1 teaspoon ground cumin1 teaspoon sweet paprika1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, hot chili powder, and/or red chili flakes, or to tasteOne 28 oz. can whole plum tomatoes with juices, roughly chopped2 teaspoons salt or adobo seasoning, more as needed1/4 teaspoon black pepper, more as needed5 oz. feta cheese, crumbled (optional)6-8 large eggsChopped parsley or cilantro, for servingPreheat oven to 375°F.  Start boiling the water in a large pot.Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat.  Add the chopped onions and bell pepper.  Cook gently until very soft, about 20 minutes.In the meantime, once the water is at a rolling boil, start whisking the water and pouring the polenta in in a steady stream.  Turn the heat down to low and continue stirring until the polenta has thickened enough that it doesn't settle back to the bottom when you stop stirring, about 1-2 minutes.  Cover and stir every 10 minutes for 30-40 minutes.Add the garlic to the onions and peppers and cook until tender, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Stir in the cumin, paprika, and cayenne, chili powder, or red chili flakes and cook another minute.  Pour in the tomatoes and juices and season with salt and pepper.  Simmer until the tomatoes have thickened, about 10 minutes.  Taste and season with more salt, adobo seasoning, pepper, cayenne, chili powder, or red pepper flakes as needed.  Stir in the feta, if using.Gently crack the eggs into the skillet over the tomatoes.  Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the eggs are just set, about 8-10 minutes.  Sprinkle with parsley or cilantro.Portion out the polenta into serving bowls.  Spoon the tomato sauce with an egg or two onto the polenta.  Serve warm with hot sauce, if desired.As you can see, I actually didn't have enough room to fit all the eggs in my skillet.  What I ended up doing was cooking four first, carefully transferring just the eggs to another dish, and then cracking another four eggs onto the sauce and sliding the skillet back into the oven.  During service, after the four eggs were plated, I transferred the remaining eggs back onto the sauce.Next:  Papaya Milk and Papaya Milk PopsiclesPreviously:  Plum, Nectarine, and Peach GaletteLast Year:  Ken Forkish's Same Day Straight Pizza DoughFour Years Ago:  Bruschetta"},

The unbaked dough, wrapped in plastic, will keep in the freezer for a few weeks, the fridge for a day or more.

{"title": "Tofu and Shiitake Potstickers", "date": "Friday, June 20, 2014", "text": "When I cut out most meats from my diet a few years ago, the one thing I missed the most wasn't steaks or burgers.  It was my mom's pork and cabbage dumplings.  To be honest, I still make and eat them once in a while because they're so good, but my tummy always feels funny after.Enter this lovely vegetarian recipe from The Kitchn that gave me the courage to try using pressed tofu as a substitute for the pork.  Their recipe actually uses baked tofu, which may be easier to find in an American supermarket; either way, you want to use a very firm, dense tofu.  If you can only find plain firm tofu, you can press and bake it yourself to get it to the consistency you need for this recipe.Because tofu can be pretty bland on its own, I like the addition of the shiitake mushrooms to add more umami to the filling.  I also added bean thread vermicelli because I really like the texture they add to the dumplings.  A big difference between this recipe and the one I usually make is that the cabbage is cooked first before being used in the filling.  This allows you to squeeze a lot more water out of the cabbage so the filling isn't as watery.Tofu and Shiitake Potstickers (adapted from The Kitchn)makes about 60 dumplings6-8 dried shiitake mushrooms1 bundle bean thread vermicelli 1 small napa cabbage, roughly choppedVegetable oilKosher salt24 oz. pressed tofu2 scallions, thinly sliced6 tablespoons soy sauce2 tablespoons sesame oil2 tablespoon sugar1 egg, beaten60 dumpling wrappersSoak the shiitake mushrooms and bean thread vermicelli in cold water.  Remove the bean thread vermicelli after about 15 minutes.  Continue to soak the mushrooms until they are easy to slice,.Use a food processor to finely chop the vermicelli, napa cabbage, and reconstituted mushrooms separately.Heat 2 teaspoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the mushrooms and saute for a few minutes until softened.  Add the cabbage and a few pinches of salt.  Stir fry until the cabbage is completely wilted, about 3-4 minutes.  Set aside and allow to cool.Meanwhile, crumble the tofu into a large mixing bowl.  Add the vermicelli, scallions, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and egg.  Stir to combine.Squeeze handfuls of the cooled mushroom-cabbage mixture in your fist to squeeze out as much moisture as possible and add to the tofu mixture.Prepare plates or trays with flour for dipping and have a small bowl of warm water ready.  Hold the wrapper in one hand and use the other to dip a finger in the water and wet the edges of the wrapper.  Put a spoonful of the filling in the middle of the wrapper and fold in half.   Seal center portion of the joined edges.   Make two pleats on both the left and right side of the dumpling.   Make sure that the whole thing is totally sealed and then dip the bottom in the flour and place on the tray.   Repeat 59 times.  (You can find a small video of how to fold the dumplings here.)Once a tray is filled, if you are planning on freezing the dumplings, place it in your freezer and work on the next tray.    By the time the second tray is ready, the dumplings on the first tray should be solid enough to place in a freezer bag.When you are ready to cook the dumplings, heat a tablespoon of oil in a frying pan on medium-high. Add the dumplings one at a time so that they are sitting upright.  Once the bottoms are browned, add about a 1/4 cup of water (about 1/2 cup if cooking frozen dumplings).  If you like your potstickers extra crispy, add some flour or cornstarch to the water and mix to get rid of the lumps before you add it to the pan.   Cover and let cook for a few minutes until the water is almost all gone and the dumpling skins are translucent.   Remove the lid and let the rest of the water cook off.Serve with a dipping sauce made with soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, and a pinch of sugar.I was quite impressed with how good of a ground meat substitute the crumbled, pressed tofu was.  Seriously, if I wasn't paying attention, I might not have noticed that I was eating a vegetarian dumpling at all!Next:  Orange Mocha Frappuccino!Previously:  Speculoos (Cookie Butter) Ice Cream and Mini Stroopwafel Ice Cream SandwichesFour Years Ago:  World Peace Cookies"},

{"title": "Orange and Fennel Salt-Baked Salmon", "date": "Monday, June 16, 2014", "text": "One of the best meals I've ever had was at Alain Passard's L'Arpège in Paris.  My friend Ellen and I were lucky enough to score reservations for lunch there and chose to go with the tasting menu.  After what seemed like a dozen divine courses, the main entree was brought out for us to see:An entire salmon, roasted in a salt crust!  After they showed it to us, it was brought back to the kitchen and filleted and plated.  The technique of baking in a salt crust seals in the moisture and essentially allows the fish to steam in its own juices.  Because you remove as much salt as you can before plating the fish, it doesn't get overly salty and is just seasoned perfectly.  Best of all, it makes for a really impressive main course at your next dinner party.So when I was in Seattle a couple of weeks ago and found out that Copper River salmon was back in season, I knew I had to get one and try salt-baking at home.  I bought a whole fish from Pike Place Fish Co., had it packed in a 48 hour box, and hauled it all the way back home with me.I was a little disappointed that the fish came headless, but in the long run, it was probably better for me since I was squeamish enough having to deal with the fins and all.  Thankfully it was already gutted and cleaned for me.Regardless of whether you get a whole or headless fish, you definitely want to make sure the skin is left on so that there's a barrier between the meat and the salt crust.  When the fish is done, the crust should be really hard; don't be afraid to give it a couple of good whacks to break it open.  If you're lucky like I was, the top of the crust will come off in one big piece.  I recommend doing this in front of your dinner guests, receiving yours oohs and ahs, and then bringing the fish back to the kitchen to plate. I chose to pair the fish with an orange fennel salad so that the crunch and acidity would complement the rich, tender salmon.  Orange and Fennel Salt-Baked Salmon (adapted from Food and Wine)serves 5-6One 3-lb. salmon, gutted and cleaned, with skin on2 large oranges1 large fennel bulb48 oz. (3 lbs.) kosher salt, plus more for seasoning2 egg whites1/2 cup water 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice2 tablespoons olive oil1 tablespoon capers, rinsedPreheat the oven to 450°F.Slice one of the oranges and juice the other one.  Cut the feathery tops off of the fennel bulb and save.In a large bowl, mix the salt, egg whites, and a 1/4 cup of water.  It should feel like wet sand.  Add more water if needed, to get a consistency where you can pack the salt together.  Spread about half of the salt on a large sheet pan in the approximate shape of the fish.Remove the fins from the salmon and pat dry.  Stuff the fish with the orange slices and fennel tops.  Place on top of the salt.  Use the rest of the salt to cover the body of the fish entirely; you may leave the head and tail uncovered.  Pack the salt tightly to seal.  Bake in the oven for 25 minutes.In the meantime, slice the fennel bulb in half, remove the core, and slice the rest thinly.  Toss with the orange juice, lemon juice, olive oil, and capers.  Salt and pepper to taste.When the fish is done, allow to rest in the salt for 10 minutes.  Using a knife or spoon, tap the salt crust sharply to crack.   Remove the crust and brush off any remaining salt.  Portion out the top half of the fish.  Remove the bones, orange slices, and fennel tops, and portion out the bottom half.Serve the fillets with orange fennel salad on top.Honestly, this is such a fool-proof way of cooking fish that I could've probably used regular farm-raised salmon and gotten similar results.  But just look at how red that Copper River salmon is!  I think the next time I get my hands on one, I want to try citrus curing it.Next:  Speculoos (Cookie Butter) Ice Cream and Mini Stroopwafel Ice Cream Sandwiches Previously:  Sesame-Crusted TofuLast Year:  Homemade CronutsFour Years Ago:  Elote (Mexican Grilled Corn)"},

Allow to cool on the counter for 30 minutes, then stir in the coconut and almond extract.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 4 to 5 hours; you need the base to be very cold before you process it in the ice cream machine.While the ice cream base is chilling, toast the almonds for about 10 minutes in a preheated 350°F oven.  Coarsely chop and store in the freezer until it is time to mix it in to the ice cream.  Put the chocolate in the freezer, too.Churn the mixture in your ice cream machine following the manufacturer’s instructions.  (If you want to make the bon bons, skip the next step.)  Add the chopped almonds and chocolate chunks at the very end.

{"title": "Overnight Oats in a Jar", "date": "Thursday, June 5, 2014", "text": "I recently started a new job where I no longer work from home but have to go into an office every day when I'm not traveling.  Unfortunately, the office is too small to have a great cafeteria so I've had to figure out how to bring breakfast and lunch to work for pretty much the first time in my life.  (I know, I've been spoiled.)Now that I'm not able to make myself candied bacon chocolate chip pancakes every morning (just kidding!), I was kind of lost with what to do until I remembered the wonder that is overnight oats.  Basically, you just soak dry oats in any kind of liquid overnight in the refrigerator.  For regular rolled oats, you can use a 1:1 ratio of oats to liquid.  For something thicker like steel cut oats, the ratio should be closer to 1:2 oats to liquid.  In the morning, the oats have softened enough to eat as is.  It sounds kind of boring, but the fun comes in customizing your oats!To make what I call New England Morning Overnight Oats, I added real maple syrup and freeze-dried blueberries (available from Trader Joe's) to 1/3 cup of steel cut oats in a small Mason jar and filled it up to the top with vanilla soy milk.  Put the lid on, shake it up to make sure everything is mixed, and let it sit overnight in the fridge.  That's it!  The next morning, I just grab the jar on the way to work and eat the oats straight from the jar at my desk.I've also made Almond Joy Overnight Oats (not pictured) by adding cocoa powder, sliced almonds, and shredded coconut to the oatmeal.  Other ideas for toppings include raisins, dried cranberries, sliced bananas, fruit purees or preserves, yogurt, other nuts, cinnamon, honey, and nut butters.  I prefer to use either soy, almond, or coconut milk for the liquid.My current favorite combination is to use Trader Joe's Quick Cook Steel Cut Oats and add freeze-dried strawberries (also available from Trader Joe's), sliced almonds, shredded coconut, and chia seeds.  The quick cook steel cut oats are not as chewy as regular steel cut oats (sometimes my jaw would hurt from having to chew so much!) but not as mushy as regular rolled oats.  And the chia seeds give the overnight oats a thicker, more pudding-like consistency (they're also packed with omega-3s!).It doesn't look very photogenic, but it's super yummy and only takes a minute to make the night before.  I've pretty much been packing this every day for breakfast whenever I have to go into the office, along with a travel mug full of magical cold brew coffee, which I also prepare the night before.  Just two less things to think about every morning!Next:  Vegan Almond Joy Ice Cream and Bon BonsPreviously:  Homemade Ginger BeerLast Year:  Rosemary Honey and Lemon Frozen Yogurt"},
{"title": "Homemade Ginger Beer", "date": "Tuesday, June 3, 2014", "text": "In my first post ever, I explained how I used to not really be a big fan of ginger but have since grown to love it, especially when used in sweet concoctions.  I especially love it in ginger beer; the extra bite it has compared to regular ginger ale is so refreshing and delicious.  Since I'm not a big drinker, I always check to see if a bar serves Dark & Stormies so that I can order just the ginger beer.After trying every brand I can get my hands on, I can say that I'm a fan of Gosling's, AJ Stephan's, and Fever Tree but really, really dislike Blenheim and Reed's.  Most recently I discovered Rachel's Ginger Beer in Seattle and was really tempted to buy a growler to take home until I remembered that I can make my own!You'll need either one of these glass swing-top bottles or an empty, clean plastic soda bottle.  It's recommended to use the plastic bottle since you can tell when the drink is done fermenting by squeezing the bottle (if it doesn't give, it's done) but since I very rarely have soda bottles at home, I usually just take a chance with the glass bottles.  I'll admit that once or twice I've opened the bottle before it was done, but the non-fizzy beverage is still pretty yummy as long as it's served ice-cold.The recipe calls for what seems like a lot of sugar, but that's partly because the yeast is going to eat the sugar to make carbon dioxide.  If you want a less sweet drink, you can reduce the amount of sugar, but I wouldn't cut back too much in case you lose out on the fizziness.  I've used \"instant\" and regular baker's yeast for this, and I don't think it makes much of a difference since it's going into so much water.  And since we're using yeast to produce the carbonation, there's a small amount of alcohol in the finished product.  How much?  Barely enough for me to taste, and I can usually taste alcohol since I dislike the taste so much (see above).Last note:  you can strain the ginger beer if you really want to get rid of all the sediments, but I never do because the grated ginger doesn't really bother me, and I feel like you'd lose a lot of carbonation during the straining process.  Most of the solids either end up floating on top or settling to the bottom anyways, so it's pretty easy to avoid them if you really want.  If you're not planning on straining the solids out, I'd recommend peeling the ginger before grating it (a spoon works really well for this!).Homemade Ginger Beer (adapted from here)makes a 1 liter bottle1/2 cup sugar1/8 teaspoon yeast 1 tablespoon of freshly grated ginger Juice from half a lemonCold spring or filtered waterUse a funnel to pour the sugar and yeast into a swing-top 1 liter glass bottle.Mix the freshly grated ginger with the lemon juice in a measuring cup with a spout.  Transfer the ginger and lemon juice to the bottle.  Rinse out the measuring cup with some of the cold spring or filtered water and pour that into the bottle.  Fill the bottle about half way with more cold water.Seal the bottle and shake well to mix all the ingredients together.  You want to make sure that all the sugar at the bottom has been mixed into the solution.  Carefully open the bottle and add more water until there is only an inch of air left at the top.  Seal the bottle and shake again.Leave the bottle in a warm place out of direct sunlight (unlike the picture at the very top) for about 2 days and then move to the refrigerator to stop the fermentation.  Sometimes you can tell when it's ready because if you shake the bottle, you'll see bubbles form, but sometimes you don't, and it's still fizzy.  If you really want to make sure the ginger beer is ready, double the recipe and fill up a 2 litter plastic soda bottle.  Test the fermentation by squeezing the bottle; when it doesn't give anymore, it's done.Pour over ice and enjoy!Next:  Overnight Oats in a JarPreviously: Blueberry Buttermilk Mini PiesFive Years Ago:  Black Sesame Ice Cream"},
{"title": "Blueberry Buttermilk Mini Pies", "date": "Wednesday, May 28, 2014", "text": "Last year I ate the best pie I've ever had at this popular, local restaurant.  Luckily, I was friends with someone who worked there, so I begged her for the recipe.  She was able to get it from the pastry chef, but I don't want anyone to get in trouble (myself included!) so I'm going to refrain from saying which restaurant it is.I will say, however, that this is a damn fine pie.  The sweet blueberry filling pairs nicely with the tart buttermilk pastry cream.  And the crust.  OMG, the crust....  I mean, I really like the vodka pie crust recipe from America's Test Kitchen, but this all-butter crust is simply amazing.  The texture is unlike any other pie crust I've ever tasted; it's practically crispy!  I'm guessing one of the main reasons it doesn't get all soggy like a lot of other pie crusts is because you blind bake the pie crust before filling it.I decided to make these into mini pies so that I could more easily share them with friends, and also so I wouldn't be getting into as much trouble for sharing a secret recipe word for word.  I hope.  O_o  I did have to adapt the recipe a bit since the one I got was for 10 pies, if that helps.  To blind bake the mini pie crusts in a muffin tin, I used aluminum cupcake liners to line the top of the pie crusts before weighing it down with pearl barley.  You can also use dried beans, rice, or of course, pie weights.  If you don't want to go through the trouble, you can try docking the pie crusts by poking the bottom several times with a fork, but I haven't tested that method, so I can't guarantee it'll work.Blueberry Buttermilk Mini Piesmakes 12 mini piesFor the pie crust160 g all-purpose flour25 g sugar1/4 teaspoon salt120 g cold butter, cubedIce waterCooking sprayMix the flour, sugar, and salt together in a food processor.  Add the butter and pulse until the butter has been cut into pea-sized pieces.  Transfer to a small bowl.Add ice water (just the water, not the ice) to the butter flour mixture by hand; only add enough water for the dough to come together but not be sticky.  Cover and allow dough to relax in refrigerator overnight.The next day, roll out the dough to about 1/8\".  (If you added a little too much water, like I did, make sure to flour the surface and top of the dough well before rolling.)  Use a flattened cupcake liner as a stencil, cut out 12 circles (you will probably need to re-roll out leftover scraps to get the last 2 circles).  Set aside any leftover scraps in the fridge for now.Generously grease the wells of a muffin tin with cooking spray.  Press the pie crust circles into each well.  Place a cupcake liner on top of each pie crust.  Transfer the pie crusts to the freezer for at least 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Once the pie crusts have frozen, fill the cupcake liners with you pie weight of choice (see above).  Bake for 20 minutes, or until the edges of the pie crusts just start to brown.  Remove the cupcake liners and pie weights.  If there are any holes in the crusts, use the leftover scraps to carefully patch them (which, as you can see below, I failed to do). Return the crusts to the oven and bake for another 5-10 minutes until the bottom of the pie crust is cooked through.  Allow to cool completely.  Carefully twist the pie crusts in the muffin tins to release.For the buttermilk pastry cream100 g buttermilk32 g sugar, divided8 g cornstarch1 egg10 g butter, melted and cooled1 g saltWhisk together 12 g (about 1 tablespoon) of sugar and the cornstarch.  Add the egg and whisk until mixed.In a small saucepan, bring the buttermilk and remaining sugar to a simmer.  Temper the hot buttermilk mixture into the egg mixture and return to the saucepan.  Cook over medium-low heat, scraping constantly, until it boils and thickens and no starch is detected on tongue.Pour into a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap directly on the custard, and place in the refrigerator until the surface is at room temperature.  Mix in the soft butter and salt, and return to the refrigerator to chill again.For the blueberry filling500 g blueberries, divided100 g sugar1 teaspoon salt20 g cornstarch15 g fresh lemon juiceToss 350 g of the blueberries with the sugar, salt, and cornstarch and transfer to a small saucepan.Cook on medium heat, scraping throughout until blueberries break down, thicken, and no starch is detectable on tongue (should be a chunky jam consistency).Turn off the heat and add the remaining fresh blueberries and lemon juice.  Allow to cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally to release the heat.Divide the buttermilk pastry cream among the 12 pie crusts.  Top with the blueberry filling.  Keep mini pies chilled until serving.  Next:  Homemade Ginger BeerPreviously:  Corn and Black Bean Tortilla SoupFive Years Ago:  Butter Mochi Cupcakes"},

Add the corn and black beans.  Mix the cornmeal with some water and add to the soup.  Stir and simmer for another 15 minutes.Dice the avocado and distribute half among four soup bowls.  Add half the tortilla strips equally between the bowls.  Ladle in the soup and top with the rest of the avocado, tortilla strips, and shredded cheese.  Serve with a slice of lime.You can also top the soup with sour cream, queso fresco, and cilantro.Next:  Blueberry Buttermilk Mini PiesPreviously:  Serendipitous Chocolate Chip CookiesFive Years Ago:  Kalbi (Korean Barbecue Short Ribs)"},
{"title": "Serendipitous Chocolate Chip Cookies", "date": "Tuesday, May 13, 2014", "text": "Everyone has their own favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe, and this is mine.  A couple of years ago, I attended a Sister's Appreciation Night at my church, and one of the party favors were these \"chocolate chip cookie mixes in a jar\" jars.  To be honest, I don't think I touched that jar until almost a year later, when I really wanted to try making America's Test Kitchen's Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies but didn't have all the ingredients.  Undaunted, I dumped out the contents of the jar, literally separated all the chocolate chips from the rest of the dry ingredients, and proceeded as directed.  What came out of that oven were the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had.  There was a perfect chocolate chip to cookie dough ratio, and the cookies were just slightly crisp at the edges and soft but not too gooey in the middle.The next time I wanted to make chocolate chip cookies, I decided to try repeating my success by using the same ingredients from the \"cookie in a jar\" recipe and the same process as the ATK recipe.  And it worked perfectly, again.  One thing I really like about the ATK method is that you don't have to cream the butter and sugar together, meaning you can make this recipe even without an electric mixer.  The \"cookie in a jar\" recipe simplifies the ATK ingredients a bit by only using 1 egg instead of an egg plus an egg yolk.  I also roll out slightly smaller balls of dough than what the ATK recipe calls for due to personal preferences.I call these my Serendipitous Chocolate Chip Cookies because I don't think I would've ever otherwise have come up with this perfect union of two different recipes by myself.Serendipitous Chocolate Chip Cookies makes 24 cookies1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour1 teaspoon baking powder1 teaspoon baking soda3/4 cup unsalted butter, divided 3/4 cup brown sugar1/2 cup white sugar1/4 teaspoon salt1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 large egg1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chipsPreheat oven to 375°F.  Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a medium bowl.Melt 1/2 cup butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Continue to cook the butter until the milk solids have browned, and it has a nutty aroma.  Remove from heat and add the remaining 1/4 cup of butter, stirring to melt.  Add the sugars, salt, and vanilla extract to the melted butter and whisk to combine.  Add the egg and whisk until smooth, about 30 seconds.  Let stand 3 minutes and then whisk again for 30 seconds.  Repeat the 3 minute resting and 30 second whisking two more times.Fold in the flour mixture until just combined.  Add the chocolate chips and stir once more to make sure no pockets of flour remain.Scoop out 24 balls of dough, about 2 tablespoons each.  Give each ball of dough a quick roll with your hands to make them spherical.  Place the balls of dough onto two parchment- or Silpat-covered baking sheets, about 2 inches apart from each other.Bake 9-11 minutes, until golden brown and puffy.  Cool before serving.If you wanted, you could even throw in some of the tips from the tried and true New York Times chocolate chip cookie recipe by letting the dough sit in the fridge overnight to hydrate more fully and sprinkling some flaky sea salt on top of the dough just before baking.Next:  Corn and Black Bean Tortilla SoupPreviously:  Candied Bacon Chocolate Chip PancakesFive Years Ago:  Red Bean and Black Sesame Ice Cream"},

I was going to just post about the recipe we used, but then I started thinking about all the variations I could make:  blueberry pancakes, banana brulee pancakes, and then it hit me.  I needed to make bacon chocolate chip pancakes.  Better yet, candied bacon chocolate chip pancakes.  Boom!  I think I just won at life.Candied Bacon Chocolate Chip Pancakesmakes six 5\" pancakes2 strips of bacon1/2 tablespoon brown sugar1 cup all-purpose flour1/4 teaspoon baking soda1/2 teaspoon baking powder1 teaspoon sugar1 egg 1 cup buttermilk2 tablespoons melted butter (or 1 tablespoon melted butter and 1 tablespoon melted bacon fat)3 tablespoons chocolate chipsButter or bacon fat for greasingReal maple syrup Preheat oven to 325°F.  Evenly sprinkle the brown sugar onto the bacon and bake for 20 minutes or until just crisp.  Allow bacon to cool and then chop.  Save the bacon fat if you like (I was able to pour off about 1 tablespoon of bacon fat which I used in the pancake mix along with the melted butter).Mix the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and sugar in a medium bowl.  Separate the egg white and egg yolk into two small bowls.  Mix the buttermilk with the egg whites and the melted butter (and bacon fat, if using) with the egg yolks.  Make sure the melted butter/fat isn't too hot or else you'll end up cooking the egg yolks.  Mix the buttermilk and egg yolk mixtures together.  Pour the liquids onto the dry ingredients and mix with a whisk until just combined; there will be some small lumps.  If the batter if too thick, you can thin it out with a few tablespoons of milk if you like.Heat up your pan or griddle.  Lightly grease with butter or bacon fat and wipe off with a paper towel.  Because of the high content of fat in the batter, you will probably only need to grease the pan this one time.Pour 1/3 cup of batter onto the pan.  Scatter about some chocolate chips and chopped candied bacon on top.  Cook until the edges are dry and the bottom is golden brown.  Flip the pancake and cook the other side until dry.  It's better not to overcook the second side since the chocolate might burn.  In between each pancake, wipe off any melted chocolate with a paper towel.Serve warm with real maple syrup.Lots of real maple syrup.Oh, yeah....Next:  Serendipitous Chocolate Chip CookiesPreviously:  Easy Chilaquiles with Fried Egg and AvocadoFive years ago:  Coconut Curry Noodles with Collard Greens and Broccoli"},

To make one pancake, take half the batter (about 1/2 cup), 1/4 lb. shredded cabbage (about 1 cup), 1 tablespoon scallions, 2 tablespoons panko or tempura flakes, and 1 egg and mix together.Start heating a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium heat or use the bacon fat left over from cooking the bacon.  Once the pan is hot, add the okonomiyaki batter and form into a circle.  If using the bacon, arrange half the bacon slices on top of the (uncooked side of the) okonomiyaki.  Cook for 5-6 minutes on each side.  Plate the okonomiyaki and drizzle the okonomiyaki sauce (or equivalent) and mayonnaise on top.  Sprinkle with some chopped scallions, nori komi furikake, and bonito flakes, or whatever you like.  Serve warm.The bonito flakes are so thinly shaved that the steam rising up from the okonomiyaki will make it look like it's dancing.  It's kind of creepy if you've never seen it before because it looks like it's alive, but once you get over that, it's pretty cool.  This pancake kind of reminds me of Korean pa jeon except there's less of a moist batter and more of crunchiness from the shredded cabbage.Next:  Hotter Crash PotatoesPreviously:  Squid Ink Spaghetti Aglio e OlioLast Year:  Cauliflower Steak with Cauliflower PuréeFive Years Ago:  New England Clam Chowda and Homemade Oyster Crackers"},
{"title": "Squid Ink Spaghetti Aglio e Olio", "date": "Friday, February 14, 2014", "text": "Last year for Valentine's Day I celebrated by making jjajungmyeon (Korean black bean noodles).  This year, I stayed with the color scheme but went Italian and made squid ink spaghetti aglio e olio, inspired by my trip to Venice.After our time in Rome, my cousin Leslie and I took the train up to La Serenissima.  Despite being colder and rainier than Rome, Venice was amazing.  At just about every bridge we crossed, I felt like I had to stop and take a picture; it was so picturesque!  We spent the first half of our trip either using the complimentary hotel shuttle boat to St. Mark's Square or trudging through the rain on foot to get around.  The city wasn't that big, so we were able to see St. Mark's Basilica, the Doge's Palace, the Accademia, and Rialto Bridge pretty easily this way.  It wasn't until we decided to get a pass for the vaporetto (the public water bus), though, that I really began to feel like more than just a tourist.  At last we were able to see Venice from the Grand Canal as it was meant to be seen.  It didn't hurt that we were usually surrounded by locals commuting back and forth from work, either.While scouring the grocery store on the last day for edible souvenirs to bring home, I found a package of spaghetti al nero di seppia, or squid ink spaghetti.  I had ordered spaghetti with cuttlefish ink sauce a couple of times in Venice a couple of times and really enjoyed it, so I decided to buy the pasta and try to make it at home.  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find any actual squid or cuttlefish ink to make the sauce with, although in my search I did find squid ink pasta at a local Italian store, so you probably don't have to go all the way to Venice to find the pasta.  Without any ink, I decided to prepare the pasta simply, aglio e olio, with garlic and olive oil and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  This recipe is even easier than spaghetti carbonara and you're almost certain to already have all the ingredients (you can use regular spaghetti if you don't have any squid ink pasta).Squid Ink Spaghetti Aglio e Olioserves 1A small fistful of squid ink spaghettiA few glugs of olive oil1 garlic clove, thinly slicedA pinch of red pepper flakesSea salt  Chopped parsley or basilBring a pot of salted water boil.  Add the spaghetti to the pot and cook according to the packaging (mine says to cook for 10-12 minutes).In the meantime, add the olive oil and sliced garlic to a small saucepan and set on low heat.  Once the garlic starts to sizzle, add the red pepper flakes and sea salt to taste.  Continue to heat while the spaghetti is cooking, but do not allow the garlic to brown.  If this starts to happen, remove the pan from heat.When the spaghetti is done cooking, use a pasta scooper to add it to the saucepan.  You want a little bit of the pasta water to go along with it so don't worry about draining it first.  Toss the spaghetti with the olive oil until it is well coated.  Plate and garnish with some chopped parsley or basil.  Serve immediately.Next:  OkonomiyakiPreviously:  Homemade Tagliatelle with Shaved TrufflesLast Year:  Jjajungmyeon (Korean Black Bean Noodles)Four Years Ago:  Nutella Ice CreamFive Years Ago:  Tomato and Eggs over Rice"},

Rome in winter is quite different from Rome in the summer.  For one thing, there's a lot less people, meaning less or no lines for attractions. Piazza Navona was basically deserted, and I had a hard time explaining to Leslie what was so magical about that square in the summertime.  The weather was in the 50s and rainy, but it didn't stop us from eating as much gelato as we could.  I was able to revisit Grom, Il Gelato di San Crispino, and my favorite, Gelateria del Teatro (where I had to have the rosemary honey & lemon flavor again).  We also tried the gelato at Fatamorgana, which is supposedly the gelateria that started the whole natural ingredients trend.I ate a lot of pizza and pasta, some better than others (the pizza at the cafeteria in the Vatican Museum was surprisingly good, but that might be because I was hungry), but the best dish I had all vacation was the tagliatelle al tartufo bianco from Piccolo Arancio, near the Trevi Fountain.  It was the most expensive pasta on the menu, almost double the price of all the other pastas, but it was so worth it.The tagliatelle must have been freshly made, and you could taste the eggs in the dough.  They were cooked to a perfect al dente and simply dressed with some salt and butter so that the white truffle flavor could shine through.  It was definitely one of those dishes that make you stop and say grace again because it's just that good.  Naturally, I had to try to replicate it at home.Homemade Tagliatelle with Shaved Trufflesserves 21 1/2 cup all-purpose flour2 large eggs3-4 tablespoons unsalted butterSea salt and freshly ground pepperWhite truffle (if you can find it; otherwise a black truffle will work, too)Crack the eggs into a well made in the middle of the flour.  Using a fork, gently beat the eggs and gradually draw more and more of the flour into the mixture until it forms a dough.  Knead the dough for several minutes until it is smooth and elastic.  Cover and let rest while you go find your pasta maker and set it up.Cut the dough in half, covering the half that you are not working with. Roll the dough through the largest opening of your pasta maker, fold in half and repeat at the largest setting several times until the dough is nice and uniform.  At that point, start decreasing the size of the opening each time after you roll the dough through (without folding the dough in half in between).  Stop when you reach the second smallest opening.Fold the long strip of rolled dough into thirds and then one or two more times on the same axis so that you you have a manageable length to cut. Cut the dough into quarter-inch strips and unroll the noodles.  Repeat the rolling and cutting process with the other half of the dough.  Let the noodles rest and dry a bit while you boil a pot of salted water.Cook the noodles in boiling, salted water for 3-5 minutes until al dente. Drain the water, leaving the pasta in the pot.  Add the butter and salt and pepper to taste.  Toss the pasta in the pot until the butter melts and coats all the strands.  Plate the pasta and shave some truffle on top.  Serve immediately.Sadly, mine doesn't look nearly as good as the dish I had a Piccolo Arancio, but I think it tastes almost as good!Next:  Squid Ink Spaghetti Aglio e Olio Previously:  Grilled Cheese Egg in a HoleLast Year:  Passion Fruit MarshmallowsFour Years Ago:  Lemon Pudding CakeFive Years Ago:  Toasted Coconut Ice Cream with Sesame Brittle and Crystallized Ginger"},

Then I learned a pro-tip from Five Guys:  use mayonnaise instead of butter on the outside of a grilled cheese.  It's way more spreadable and adds just a little oomph of flavor to the sandwich. I decided to take it up another notch by making an egg in a hole with the grilled cheese.  The hardest part of the whole endeavor was finding the right sized instrument to make the hole.  I didn't want the diameter of the hole to be too small or else it would take too long for the egg whites to cook through, but I didn't want it too wide either or else the height of the egg in the grilled cheese would be too low and the egg to grilled cheese surface area ratio would be too high.  I settled on using my rice maker's measuring cup, which had a diameter of 2 ¾\".  I think a tiny bit smaller would've been perfect, but as you can see, it turned out okay.  =)Grilled Cheese Egg in a Holemakes 1 sandwich2 slices soft bread, like white or potato1-2 teaspoons mayonnaise1-2 slices of sharp white cheddar or your favorite melty cheese1 large eggFresh ground pepper and sea saltStart heating a non-stick pan on medium-low.Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on one slice of bread and place mayonnaise-side down in the pan.Cut the cheese into thirds.  Place one-third on each side of the bread in the pan.  Cut the remaining third in half and fill in the top and bottom of the gap between the other slices of cheese, leaving a cheese-less square in the middle. Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on the other slice of bread and place on top of the cheese, mayonnaise-side up.  Cook for a few minutes until the bottom is golden brown.Flip the sandwich over.  Using a cookie cutter or drinking glass, cut out a hole in the middle of the sandwich about 2 ½\" to 2 ¾\" wide.  Remove the circle of bread (you can continue grilling this on the side of the pan) and crack the egg into the hole.  Cover and cook until the egg is set to your liking. Slide the sandwich onto a plate.  Season the egg with fresh ground pepper and sea salt (I used a red Alaea salt, which is why the egg looks like it has measles).  Serve with tomato soup if you like.Next:  Homemade Tagliatelle with Shaved TrufflesPreviously:  Sarah Ruth's Saucepan BrowniesLast Year:  Rainbow Cookie SandwichesFour Years Ago:  Pear BreadFive Years Ago:  Luo Buo Gao (Chinese Turnip Cake)"},

I couldn't find any digestive biscuits in my local grocery store, so I used good ol' American Nilla wafers.  In a pinch, you could probably use a prepared graham cracker crust.  Some of the recipes I looked up used sweetened condensed milk boiled for hours in the can (essentially homemade dulche de leche) for the toffee layer, but if you don't have hours, you can just make a quick filling using butter, brown sugar, and sweetened condensed milk.This dessert kind of reminds me of Benny in that it's certainly not the prettiest dessert to look at, but once you've had some, it's irresistible.  ;)Banoffee Pie (adapted from Saveur)makes 1 pie2 sticks unsalted butter11 oz. box of Nilla wafers½ cup packed brown sugar14 oz. can sweetened condensed milk3 or 4 bananas1 pint heavy creamPowdered sugar, to tasteA pinch or two of espresso powder (optional)Grated chocolateMelt one of the sticks of butter in a small saucepan.Crush the wafers in a food processor until you get a fine crumb texture.

Cover tightly and steam over low to medium heat for 20 minutes.While the rice is steaming, open the can of coconut milk and spoon out the thick cream on top into a small bowl.Pour the thinner, lighter coconut milk left in the can into a small saucepan.  Stir in 2 tablespoons of sugar and 3/4 teaspoon salt.  Warm over medium heat, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Do not let the sauce boil.When the rice is done, transfer it to a mixing bowl (it will be clumpy).  Slowly pour the warm coconut milk over the rice in the bowl, stirring frequently. You want the milk to coat the rice but not leave puddles. Keep stirring, and stop pouring in coconut milk when it looks like the rice is saturated. You may not use all of the milk.  Set the rice aside to finish absorbing the coconut milk; after 15 minutes or so it should have soaked up any milk that is still liquid.While the rice is standing, make the coconut topping sauce. Rinse out the coconut milk saucepan and pour in the coconut cream that you took off the top of the can. Stir in 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together a few teaspoons of water and the cornstarch.Whisk this cornstarch slurry into the coconut cream and cook over low heat for about 3 minutes, or until the mixture thickens considerably. Set aside.Peel the mangoes and then slice the flesh into 1 inch wide strips. To serve, place about 1/3 cup cooked sticky rice on each plate, and arrange mango slices around it.

Transfer to a rack to cool.Remove top of pumpkin by cutting a circle around the stem with a small sharp knife. Scrape out seeds and any loose fibers from inside pumpkin with a spoon (including top of pumpkin; reserve seeds for another use if desired).  Season the inside with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a drizzle of honey.Whisk together cream, nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a bowl. Mix together cheeses in another bowl.Put a layer of toasted bread cubes in bottom of pumpkin, then cover with about 1/2 cup cheese and about 1/3 cup cream mixture. Drizzle some more honey on top of the cheese and cream.  Continue layering bread, cheese, cream mixture, and honey until pumpkin is filled to about 1/2 inch from top. (You may have some leftover bread, cheese, and cream left over.)Cover pumpkin with top and put in an oiled small roasting pan. Brush outside of pumpkin all over with olive oil. Bake 1 hour and then remove the top.Return the rest of the pumpkin to the oven and bake until the top of the cheese is browned and bubbly, about 10 - 15 minutes.  Serve with the rest of the baguette slices.Next:  Thai Coconut Sticky Rice with MangoPreviously:  My Mom's Pi Jiu Ya (Beer-Braised Duck)Last year:  Pretzel Ice Cream Pie with Homemade Magic ShellFour years ago:  Apple-Pear-Cranberry Crisp"},

Instead of cooking the aromatics in a different pan and then transferring everything into a casserole dish, I just used my Dutch oven (don't know how I lived without this baby!)  If you don't have one, just transfer the rice to a casserole dish with a lid, or do what my mom does and just cover it with aluminum foil.My mom usually makes this with pork or chicken, but I decided to make it with Chinese sausage (which I guess makes it more Cantonese than Taiwanese).  You can find the Chinese sausage and fried shallots (sometimes labelled fried red onions) in a Chinese grocery store.  If you like cilantro, it makes a great topping, but if you don't, it still tastes great without it.  For a little kick, I highly recommend serving it with some sweet chili sauce.My Mom's Taiwanese Sticky Riceserves 6-83 1/2 cups sweet glutinous rice6-7 dried shiitake mushrooms1 tablespoon oil 3 links Chinese sausage, chopped2 tablespoons fried shallots2 tablespoons rice wine1 tablespoon sugar1/3 cup soy sauce1 tablespoon sesame oilSoak the sweet rice and mushrooms in room temperature water for an hour.  The mushrooms will float so place a lid or dish on top to weigh them down.Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Start boiling 4 cups of water in a large pot.  Squeeze the water out of the mushrooms and cut off the stems.  Slice the mushroom caps and set aside.Drain the rice and add to the boiling water.  Make sure that the water covers the rice, adding more water if needed.  Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until almost all the water is absorbed.  The rice will have plumped but won't be soft yet.In the meantime, heat up the oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat.  Add the sausage and cook for a few minutes until the fat is rendered out but before it browns.  Add the mushroom and fried shallots and stir fry for about a minute or two.  Add the rice wine, sugar, soy sauce, and sesame oil and mix well.Add the rice to the Dutch oven.  Mix very well so that the rice is the same color throughout.  Cover and bake for 20 minutes.Fluff and serve with cilantro and sweet chili sauce, if desired.Next:  My Mom's Pi Jiu Ya (Beer-Braised Duck)Previously:  Kaddo (Afghan Pumpkin with Yogurt and Tomato Sauces)Last Year:  Duchikey (or Simplified Turducken)Five Years Ago:  Homemade Crystallized Ginger"},

{"title": "Bahian Style Moqueca (Brazilian Fish Stew)", "date": "Monday, October 14, 2013", "text": "A few years ago, I visited Rio de Janeiro with my friend Ellen, a fellow foodie.  Our second night there, we had planned to walk from our hotel in Copacabana to Azul Arinho, a restaurant on Ipanema known for their moqueca.  Along the way, we found a cute gelato shop, Beijo Carioca, and, upon realizing that they would be closed by the time we would be done with dinner, we had to stop and get a pre-dinner treat.  The gelato was so good that on our last day in Rio, with only an hour left before we had to head to the airport, we made a mad dash back for a last taste of paradise.Continuing on to dinner, we passed by a Koni Store, and since I had read about this trendy new restaurant, we just had to stop and try a salmon hand roll.  Then there was the churro cart around the corner...but we decided that we absolutely could not eat anything else before we got to dinner (and hoped that the churro cart would still be there on the way home).Despite not being the last bit hungry due to all the pre-dinner snacking, I found myself absolutely loving the moqueca.  We got ours Bahian style, which means it's cooked with coconut milk, palm oil, and cilantro and served with white rice, pirão (a gravy made from fish broth and cassava flour), and dendê farofa (cassava flour cooked in palm oil).I haven't been able to find palm oil, but this recipe from The Perfect Pantry uses annatto seeds simmered in canola oil to make a similarly bright orange oil.  If you can't find annatto seeds, you can just use sweet paprika instead.  When a recipe calls for adding salt at the end to taste, I've started using adobo seasoning instead of just plain salt, especially for Latin-inspired dishes, for even more flavor.  Other than that I pretty much followed this recipe from Simply Recipes to make the rice and stew.  I've made the stew with haddock and cod and had a slight preference for the haddock version.  I can only imagine how good it would taste with sea bass instead.Bahian Style Moqueca (Brazilian Fish Stew)serves 4For the annatto oil:1/2 teaspoon annatto seeds1/4 cup canola oilFor the rice:1 tablespoon olive oil1/2 onion, chopped1 clove garlic, minced1 1/2 cups white rice1 teaspoon kosher saltFor the stew:1 1/2 - 2 lbs. of fillets of firm white fish such as haddock, cod, or sea bass, rinsed in cold water, pin bones removed, cut into large portions3 cloves garlic, minced4 tablespoons lime juice Kosher saltFreshly ground black pepperOlive oil1 medium yellow onion, sliced1 yellow or red bell pepper, seeded, de-stemmed, and chopped (or sliced)1 tablespoon paprika (optional)Pinch red pepper flakes 2 cups sliced plum tomatoes1/4 cup green onion greens, chopped 1 large bunch of cilantro, chopped with some set aside for garnish14-ounce can coconut milkAdobo seasoning, to taste (optional) In a small saucepan, combine the annatto seeds and canola oil. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, until the oil turns orange. Remove from heat, strain out the seeds (and discard), and set the oil aside to cool. This can be done far in advance.To make the rice, heat one tablespoon of olive oil in a medium saucepan on medium high heat. Add the chopped 1/2 onion and cook, stirring, until the onion is translucent. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds more, until the garlic is fragrant. Add the raw white rice and salt and stir to coat completely with the oil, onions, and garlic.  Transfer to a rice cooker and add the recommended amount of water (mine uses 2 cups water for 1 1/2 cups of rice).  Cook the rice in the rice cooker while you make the stew. Place the fish in a bowl and add the minced garlic and lime juice so that the pieces are well coated. Sprinkle generously all over with salt and pepper. Keep chilled while preparing the rest of the soup. In a large covered pan (such as a Dutch oven), coat the bottom with about 2 tablespoons of olive oil and heat on medium heat. Add the onion and cook a few minutes until softened. Add the bell pepper, paprika (if using), and red pepper flakes. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.  Cook for a few minutes longer, until the bell pepper begins to soften. Stir in the tomatoes and green onion. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes, uncovered. Stir in the chopped cilantro.Use a large spoon to remove about half of the vegetables (you'll put them right back in). Spread the remaining vegetables over the bottom of the pan to create a bed for the fish. Arrange the fish pieces on the vegetables. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Then add back the previously removed vegetables, covering the fish. Pour the coconut milk and annatto oil over the fish and vegetables.Bring soup to a simmer, reduce the heat, cover, and let simmer for 15 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings. You may need to add more salt or adobo seasoning, lime juice, paprika, pepper, or chili flakes to get the soup to the desired seasoning for your taste.  Garnish with cilantro and serve with the rice.I was actually pretty surprised at how close to the real thing this tasted considering how exotic the flavors are to me.  As with most stews, this tastes even better the next day and the day after that, when the flavors have had a chance to meld together more.Next:  Pão de Queijo (Brazilian Cheese Bread)Previously:  Pluot Lambic SorbetLast year:  Crispy Kale Pizza"},

{"title": "Apple Cider Donuts", "date": "Tuesday, October 8, 2013", "text": "Cider donuts from Honeypot HillOne of my favorite things about fall is apple cider donuts.  They have to come fresh from an apple orchard from New England, though, preferably on a brisk, sunny day.  I've tried the ones they sell at super markets and even the state fair, but they're just not the same.If you've never had one before, you might be disappointed to hear that they don't really taste like apple cider.  That said, they're still incredibly delicious and pair perfectly with a nice, cold glass of cider.  I like my cider donuts on the small side, coated with cinnamon and sugar, and, most importantly, fresh from the fryer so that they're still warm and crispy.  The interior should be cakey, but not dry, and never, ever greasy.Luckily, even if you don't live in New England, you can make your own as long as you can get your hands on some real apple cider:  the cloudy, unfiltered kind that burns just a little bit on the way down your throat, not the weak, see through stuff they sell off-season. Apple Cider Donuts (from Food52)makes 10-12 donuts1 cup apple cider2 3/4 cups cake flour1 teaspoon baking powder1 teaspoon salt1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg2/3 cups sugar2 tablespoons non-hydrogenated shortening1 egg1 egg yolk1/3 cup buttermilkcanola oil, for frying1/2 cup sugar, for topping2 teaspoons cinnamon, for toppingBring the apple cider to a boil over high heat and cook it until it has reduced to 1/3 cup, 7-10 minutes. Set aside to cool while you prepare the rest of the donuts.    Sift the cake flour, baking powder, salt and nutmeg.    In the bowl of a stand mixer, mix the shortening and sugar together on medium speed until sandy. Add in the egg and egg yolk and mix on high until light and thickened, about 5 minutes.   Mix the reduced apple cider and buttermilk together. Then add the flour mixture, alternating with the milk mixture to the mixer in three additions mixing until just combined. The dough will be soft and sticky much like cookie dough.   Transfer the mixture to a clean bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least one hour or overnight.    When you are ready to roll and fry the donuts, heat a large pot or dutch oven with at least 2 inches of oil over medium heat until the oil reaches 370ºF on a candy thermometer.Gently roll the chilled dough out onto a generously floured board or piece of parchment paper into a circle about 1/2'' thick and about 8'' wide.Cut as many donuts as possible, making sure to flour the cutters before each cut.  If at any time the dough becomes too soft to handle, just put it in the refrigerator for a few minutes. Place the cut donuts on a parchment lined baking sheet and refrigerate for 15 minutes until they are slightly firm and easier to handle. While the donuts are chilling, stir together the cinnamon and sugar for the topping in a shallow, wide bowl.    Brush off any excess flour and fry the donuts for about 1 minute per side, being careful not to crowd the pan.  When the donuts are deep golden brown on each side, remove them from the oil, gently blot off excess oil and toss immediately in the cinnamon sugar.I had a couple of issues with this version:  the finished product was a little too dense for my liking, the outside was only barely crispy, even fresh out of the fryer, and I had a hard time getting the cinnamon and sugar to stick to the donut.  My friends who got to try them liked them enough, though, so I probably just have really high standards when it comes to cider donuts.  Next time I might try Smitten Kitchen's version, which are fried in Crisco.Next:  Pluot Lambic SorbetPreviously:  Salted Butter Caramel Apple Pie with Vodka Pie CrustLast year:  Caramelized Onion and Swiss Chard Quiche"},

Salted Butter Caramel Apple Pie with Vodka Pie Crustmakes 1 pieFor the pie crust:2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour2 tablespoons sugar1 teaspoon salt12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces and chilled8 tablespoons vegetable shortening, cut into 4 pieces and chilled1/4 cup vodka, chilled1/4 cup ice waterProcess 1 1/2 cups flour, sugar, and salt together in food processor until combined.  Scatter butter and shortening over top and continue to process until incorporated and mixture begins to form uneven clumps with no remaining floury bits.  Sprinkle remaining 1 cup flour over dough and pulse until mixture has broken up into pieces and is evenly distributed around the bowl.Transfer mixture to a large bowl.  Sprinkle vodka and ice water over mixture.  Stir and press dough together, using stiff rubber spatula, until dough sticks together.Divide dough into 2 even pieces.  Turn each piece of dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and flatten each into a 4-inch disk.  Wrap each piece tightly in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.For the caramel sauce:1 cup granulated sugar1 1/2 teaspoons salt1/2 cup room temperature water12 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened to room temperature2 tablespoons heavy creamCombine the granulated sugar, salt, and water in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar is dissolved.  Turn the heat down to medium-low and cook without stirring, until the syrup becomes a medium dark amber caramel, about 15 minutes.Remove the pan from heat and immediately stir in the room temperature butter and cold heavy cream. Do not worry if the butter starts to separate; it will come together as the caramel cools. Transfer the caramel to a medium bowl and whisk until the caramel begins to come together.  Set aside.For the apple pie:2 teaspoons fresh lemon zest1/4 cup fresh lemon juice6 large apples, cored, peeled, and thinly sliced (use a variety for better flavor, such as Macintosh, Golden Supreme, and Honey Crisp)1/4 cup all-purpose flour1/4 teaspoon ground cloves1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon1/2 cup granulated sugar1 egg yolk1 tablespoon milkPut the lemon zest and lemon juice into a very large bowl. Add the apples and toss gently. In a small mixing bowl, combine the flour, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and sugar. Pour over the apples and gently toss to combine. Set aside.Preheat oven to 400°F.On a floured work surface, roll out one of the balls of chilled dough (keep the other one in the refrigerator). Turn the dough about a quarter turn after every few rolls until you have a circle about 12\" in diameter. Carefully place the dough into a 9\"x2\" pie dish. Tuck it in with your fingers, making sure it is smooth. Fill the pie crust with the apples. There are a lot of apples, but pile them tightly and very high. Drizzle with 1/2 cup of the salted caramel, reserving the rest for topping.Roll out the other ball of dough to a 10\" circle.  Carefully place on top of the pie.  Fold over any excess dough and crimp all the way around.  Cut a few slits into the top with a sharp knife.Make an egg wash by beating the egg yolk with the milk.  Brush the top with a very thin coating.Place the pie onto a large baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Keeping the pie in the oven, turn the temperature down to 350°F and bake for an additional 40-50 minutes. If the top of your pie is getting too brown, cover loosely with aluminum foil. The pie will be done when the caramel begins to bubble up. A small knife inserted inside should come out relatively clean.Allow the pie to cool for 4 hours before serving. Drizzle the pie with the extra caramel sauce to serve.Previously:   Sweet Corn Ice Cream with Black Raspberry SwirlNext:  Apple Cider Donuts"},

Growing up in Ohio has its share of pros and cons, but one of the perks is being able to buy sweet corn in the summer from roadside stands.  You can actually see the fields where the corn was harvested, and it's so amazingly fresh and sweet that all other corn just tastes like dust in comparison. This recipe is another one from Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home, which has basically become my ice cream making bible.  I couldn't find any black raspberries at the farmer's market or the grocery story, so I did as she suggested and made the sauce with half red raspberries and half blackberries.Sweet Corn Ice Cream with Black Raspberry Swirl (from Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home)makes about 1 quartTo make the black raspberry swirl: 2 cup black raspberries or red raspberries and blackberries1 cup sugarTo make the ice cream base:1 ear of fresh, sweet corn, husked2 cups milk4 teaspoons cornstarch3 tablespoons cream cheese, softened1/4 teaspoon kosher salt1 1/4 cups heavy cream2/3 cup sugar2 tablespoons light corn syrupCombine berries and 1 cup sugar in a 1-quart saucepan over medium-high heat, and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 8 minutes; strain and chill.Slice the kernels from the corn cob, then \"milk\" the cob by scraping it with the back of your knife to extract the liquid; reserve the kernels and liquid.Mix about 2 tablespoons of the milk with the cornstarch in a small bowl to make a smooth slurry.  Whisk the cream cheese and salt in a medium bowl until smooth.Combine the remaining milk, cream, sugar, corn syrup, corn kernels and juices in a 4-quart saucepan, bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat, and boil for 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and force the mixture through a sieve into a bowl, leaving the corn \"cases\" behind.Return the mixture to the saucepan and gradually whisk in the cornstarch slurry.  Bring back to a boil over medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 1 minute.  Remove from the heat.Gradually whisk the hot milk mixture into the cream cheese until smooth. Pour mixture into a 1-gallon Ziploc freezer bag, seal, and submerge in a bowl of ice water until chilled. Pour mixture into an ice cream maker and spin until thick and creamy.After churning, alternate layers of ice cream and berry sauce in a storage container before freezing.The black raspberry sauce is really yummy but may overpower the delicate flavor of the sweet corn.  When I make this again I'll probably reduce the amount of sauce I layer in and increase the salt in the ice cream base a bit just to bring out the flavor of the sweet corn even more.Previously:  Lobster BisqueNext up:  Salted Butter Caramel Apple Pie with Vodka Pie Crust"},

(May I suggest brown butter vinaigrette lobster buns or ramen lobster rolls?)Lobster Bisque (adapted form Bon Appetit)makes 6 servings2-4 one-pound lobsters, steamed in salted water2 tablespoons olive oil1 onion, sliced1 large celery stalk, sliced1 small carrot, sliced1 garlic head, cut in half crosswise1 tomato, sliced2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme2 bay leaves8 whole black peppercorns1 cup dry sherry1/4 cup tomato paste4 tablespoons butter4 tablespoons flour1/2 cup whipping creamCrack tail and claw shells over the pot you used to steam the lobsters to catch any juices and remove lobster meat. Reserve the steaming liquid and juices.  Coarsely chop lobster meat; cover and chill. Coarsely chop lobster shells and bodies; transfer to medium bowl. Heat olive oil in heavy large pot over high heat. Add lobster shells and bodies and sauté until shells begin to brown, about 8 minutes. Add onion and next 8 ingredients.  Boil until almost all liquid has evaporated, about 4 minutes. Add the reserved steaming liquid and lobster juices and enough water to make a total of 6 cups of liquid. Simmer 1 hour.Strain soup through sieve set over large saucepan, pressing firmly on solids. Whisk tomato paste into soup. Simmer until soup is reduced to 3 cups, about 15 minutes. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the flour and whisk together.  Cook until the roux turns a pale blonde.  Whisk in the lobster stock and cream and bring to a boil.  Continue stirring to ensure that the roux is dissolved and doesn't burn.  After a few minutes the bisque should thicken slightly.Divide the lobster meat among 6 soup bowls.  Ladle in the bisque and serve hot.I was surprised at how flavorful the bisque was even though I didn't add any salt (other than the original amount I added to the steaming liquid, which was like a large pinch).  I was tempted to add a drizzle of flavored oil on top, but then I realized it would only be to make the bowl more photogenic.  It honestly needs absolutely nothing added to it, so I just kept it that way.Previously:  Ramen Lobster Rolls Next up:  Sweet Corn Ice Cream with Black Raspberry Swirl"},

For the lobster salad, I mixed the chopped lobster meat with some Kewpie (Japanese-style) mayonnaise and sprinkled in a little bit of the ramen seasoning and sesame oil to taste.  If I had had scallions, I would have chopped some up and added them too, just continue on with the Asian theme.Ramen Lobster Rollsmakes 2 rolls1 package instant ramen1 egg, beatenOil for fryingMeat from one 1 1/2 lb. lobster, chopped and chilledKewpie or regular mayonnaise1/4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil (optional)Scallions, chopped (optional)Bring a small pot of water to boil and cook the ramen noodles until they are cooked but still firm.  Drain and rinse with cold water.

{"title": "Brown Butter Vinaigrette Lobster Buns", "date": "Friday, September 6, 2013", "text": "This past week the Stop & Shop circular advertised lobsters for only $3.99/lb!  I was already planning on having friends over for a dinner party so I decided to pick up 6 lobsters and have a lobster crackin' party outside on my patio.  Sadly, when I got to the seafood section, I found out that the sale had ended on Labor Day, and the lobsters were now $5.99/lb.  Boo.....So I ended up just picking up 4 lobsters and decided to make lobster rolls instead.  Traditionally, lobster rolls consist of lobster meat dressed with mayonnaise in a buttered top-split bun.  If you don't live in New England, you've probably never seen a top-split hot dog bun.  When I first moved to Boston, I thought they were kind of weird and reminded me of a slice of Wonder Bread folded in half.  But that was before I realized that they provide a better meat to bread ratio than regular hot dog buns and also toast up nicer.Last year I went to Portland, Maine for the first time and had the best lobster rolls in my life at the Eventide Oyster Co.  Theirs is rather nontraditional in that they swap out the mayonnaise for a brown butter vinaigrette, and they serve it in a homemade steamed bun.  It was soooooooo good, I had to try to recreate it!First of all, the lobster meat.  This was my first time cooking lobsters by myself, and it was not my finest moment.  Lobsters already creep me out a bit because 1) they look like bugs and 2) they're still alive and moving around when you cook them.  I know you can kill them by putting a knife through their head before cooking them, but I wasn't about to do that because see 1) and 2) above.  And even after you kill them that way they still move around!  Nope!Instead I put them in the freezer for about 20 minutes before cooking them so that they were nice and relaxed.  Even then I couldn't handle touching them so I used tongs to transfer them to the pot or just slid them in from the bag.  I chose to steam them rather than boil them because it takes a lot less time to bring an inch of water to boil vs. a whole pot.I followed this video to crack the lobster and extract the meat, making sure to crack the lobsters over the pot with the steaming water in order to catch all the juices.  (I saved this liquid to make lobster bisque the next day.)  You'll find the majority of the meat in the claws, knuckles, and tail.  There's pockets of meat in the body, and you can squeeze out little tubes of meat from the legs, but that was a lot more work than I was interested in doing, so I just left the bodies for my friends to pick at if they wanted to (they wanted to).Now let's talk about the buns.  I'd recommend making them from the dough in my hua juan recipe, but if you're lucky enough to live near an Asian grocery story that sells steamed buns you can use those too.  I was kind of lazy and just bought some from Super 88.  I think they worked out okay, but using homemade bao buns would've been infinitely better.For the brown butter vinaigrette I just browned a stick of butter and added the juice from one lemon and salt to taste.  Quickly sauté with the lobster meat just to heat through, top with some chopped chives, and it's ready for the steamed buns.Brown Butter Vinaigrette Lobster Buns (inspired by Eventide Oyster Co.)makes 6 small buns3 one-pound lobsters1/2 cup unsalted butterJuice from one lemon (about 1/4 cup)Salt to tasteChives, chopped6 steamed bunsFill a large pot with 1\" of water and throw in enough salt to make it as salty as the sea.  Bring to a boil.  Add the lobsters (one at a time if your pot isn't big enough), cover, and steam for 10 minutes.  Remove the lobsters to a rimmed baking sheet and allow to cool.Once they are cool enough to touch, twist off the claws and tail and remove the meat.  Coarsely chop and set aside.Heat a medium pot on medium heat and melt the butter.  Swirl the pot around occasionally and continue to heat until the milk solids at the bottom turn brown and the butter smells starts to smell nutty.  Immediately remove from heat and continue to swirl the pot around so that the milk solids don't burn.  Add the lemon juice and salt to taste.  Toss in the chopped lobster meat and return the pot to heat just until the lobster meat is heated through.If needed, reheat the steamed buns in the microwave.  Fill the buns with the lobster salad and top with the chopped chives.  Serve warm.Previously:  Jim Lahey's No-Knead BreadNext up:  Ramen Lobster Rolls"},
{"title": "Jim Lahey's No-Knead Bread", "date": "Wednesday, August 28, 2013", "text": "A new chapter of my life started recently when I became a homeowner for the first time.  The first picture I saw of the place was of the kitchen, and it basically had me at hello. It's not the biggest, nor is it the brightest, but something about it just called out to me in a way that none of the other listings I'd been looking at for the last 2 months did.  It was the first place I physically went to look at, and I made an offer the same day!The kitchen was the very first room that I unpacked; can you spot my Vitamix blender, Kitchenaid stand mixer, and Lello gelato maker?  I also acquired my very first piece of Le Creuset!  I picked up the Dutch oven from Bed, Bath, and Beyond for half off (old, discontinued model) on tax-free weekend with a 20% off coupon.  ^_^I decided the first thing I would make in my new home in the Le Creuset would be Jim Lahey's No-Knead Bread.  After all, what's more homey than homemade bread? This recipe was printed in The New York Times in 2006 and pretty much revolutionized homemade bread baking.  The recipe calls for a very wet, shaggy dough which you let rise overnight and is baked in a Dutch oven with the lid on for the first half hour.  This allows steam to build up in the Dutch oven which does something to the dough so that you get the most gorgeous, crispy crust after the lid is removed.  My guess is that it has something to do with keeping the exterior of the dough from cooking too much before the inside has had a chance to bake through.  Usually it's almost impossible to get this kind of crust from a home oven, but the use of a super-wet dough and the Dutch oven changed all that.No-Knead Bread (adapted from The New York Times)makes 1 small loaf1 1/2 cups bread flour, more for dusting1/8 teaspoon instant yeast1/2 teaspoon salt3/4 cup waterIn a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add water, and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70°F.Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450°F. Put a 5-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is okay. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.I was quite pleased with the texture of the bread and especially the crust.  I would say this is a good, dependable recipe to use for making crusty, white bread, but I think I'm going to experiment a little bit with making my own starter for some more complexity of flavor....Next: Brown Butter Vinaigrette Lobster BunsPreviously:  Mozzarella Stuffed Arancini (Risotto Balls)"},

It's not one of those quick, easy recipes that you can throw together in 15 minutes or less.  It takes time and almost-constant attention, which you can only give something you love.You start with arborio rice, a short grain rice, which is chewier and starchier than long grain rice.  The rice is sauteed first before any liquids are added, until the edges start to get translucent and the center is still opaque.  Then some white wine is added to deglaze the pan and add some depth of flavor.  Once the wine has been fully absorbed, hot stock is added a ladleful at a time.  In between each addition of stock, you need to stir the risotto and make sure that all the liquid has been absorbed before adding the next ladleful.  This is what gives the risotto the velvety, creamy texture.  That, and love.I love mushroom risotto because it's a great way to showcase the sometimes subtle flavor of mushrooms.  I finally got a shipment of crimini mushrooms in my Boston Organics delivery last week so I was excited to make this dish with them.  It's even better if you have wild mushrooms, though, like morels if you can get your hands on them.Crimini Mushroom Risottomakes 4 servings1/2 lb. crimini mushrooms, finely chopped1 tablespoon olive oil6 tablespoons unsalted butter, dividedKosher salt1 small onion, chopped1 garlic clove, minced1 2/3 cup arborio rice1/4 cup white wine1 quart mushroom, vegetable, or chicken stock, hot1 teaspoon parsley, chopped1/3-1/2 cup Parmesan reggiano cheese, gratedTruffle salt (optional)Heat the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter in a large saute pan on medium heat.  Add the mushrooms and saute until softened.  Season to taste with salt, transfer to a bowl (along with the juices), and set aside.In the same pan, melt 2 more tablespoons of butter and add the chopped onions.  Once the onions start to sweat, add the garlic and cook for another minute or two until softened. Add the arborio rice and stir so that it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan.  After about 5 minutes, once the rice has started to turn translucent on the edges but is still opaque in the center, add the white wine and stir to deglaze the pan. Once the wine has been absorbed, add a ladleful of hot stock and keep stirring.  Continue to add the stock a ladleful at a time once the rice has absorbed all the liquid.When all the stock has been used up, add the mushrooms along with their juices back into the rice and stir.  Cover the rice for 2 minutes to finish cooking.Remove from heat and stir in the chopped parsley, remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, and cheese.  Finish with truffle salt, if using.  Serve immediately.Even though the dish gets all creamy, the rice should still have some bite to it and not be all mushy.  If you do happen to have leftovers, make sure you refrigerate them so that you can make arancini (risotto balls) out of them (recipe coming up next)!Next:  Mozzarella Stuffed Arancini (Risotto Balls)Previously:  Shakshuka Pizza"},

I'd heard of the dish--eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce--before and was very curious about how it'd taste.  I found it to be warming and comforting without being heavy.It's pretty easy to make at home, but the limiting factor for me is always not having any bread to eat along with it.  But then one day I had an extra ball of pizza dough and thought, why don't I just cook the eggs and tomato sauce on top of it?  And thus shakshuka pizza was born.The first time I made it I wasn't sure if the 7 minutes in the oven would be enough to cook the eggs so I made sure the tomato sauce was still hot when I topped the pizza.  I guessed wrong, though, and the yolks ended up setting by the time I took the pizza out of the oven.  I prefer my yolks still runny while the whites are set so the next time I refrigerated the sauce first and they came out perfect. I like to scoop up all the runny yolk and spread it all around the top of the pizza.  It might not be pretty, but it sure is yummy!Shakshuka Pizza makes two 10\" pizzas2 8 oz. balls of pizza dough3 tablespoons olive oil, divided1 small onion, chopped1 garlic clove, minced1 teaspoon cumin1 teaspoon chili powder1 pinch red pepper flakes1 cup tomato sauceSalt, to taste4 eggs1/2 cup crumbled feta cheeseParsley, choppedPlace a pizza stone on an oven rack set at the top 1/3 of the oven.  Preheat the oven to 550°F.In a small saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil on medium.  Add the chopped onions and saute until starting to soften.  Add the garlic and continue to cook for another minute or two until the garlic has lost its bite.  Add the cumin, chili powder, and red pepper flakes and cook until the spices are toasty and fragrant.Add the tomato sauce and simmer for 15 minutes.  Add salt to taste.  If you want your egg yolks to be set, use the sauce while it's still hot.  If you want your egg yolks to be runny, cool the sauce down and chill in the fridge before using.Stretch the dough onto a parchment paper-lined flexible cutting board.Spread half a tablespoon of olive oil on top of the dough.  Top with half of the tomato sauce.Crack two eggs onto the pizza.  Top with half of the feta cheese.Slide one of the pizzas and parchment paper onto the pizza stone and bake for 5 minutes.After 5 minutes, turn the oven to broil and broil for 1-2 minutes.  Bake until the eggs are set to your liking and the crust is golden with spots of brown and a few small spots of char. Use tongs to slide the pizza with the parchment paper from the pizza stone onto a cutting board.  Top the pizza with the chopped parsley.  Slice and serve!Next:  Crimini Mushroom RisottoPreviously:  Almond Pesto Pizza"},

Flip it over on a cutting board and make sure the back side is evenly coated as well.When the mochi is completely cool, cut into small bits and pieces and continue to coat with extra cornstarch while cutting to avoid letting the pieces stick together.Freeze the mochi bits until the ice cream is ready to pack.For the matcha green tea ice cream: (adapted from Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home)2 cups whole milk1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch1 1/2 ounces (3 tablespoons) cream cheese, softened1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt1 tablespoon matcha green tea powder1 tablespoon vodka1 1/4 cup heavy cream2/3 cup sugar2 tablespoons light corn syrupMix about 2 tablespoons of the milk with the cornstarch in a small bowl to make a smooth slurry. Whisk the cream cheese and salt in a medium bowl until smooth.  Fill a large bowl with ice and water.Mix the matcha powder with the vodka and stir until smooth. Combine the remaining milk, the cream, sugar, and corn syrup in a 4-quart saucepan, bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat, and boil for 4 minutes. Remove from the heat, and gradually whisk in the cornstarch slurry.Bring the mixture back to a boil over medium-high heat and cook, stirring with a heatproof spatula, until slightly thickened, about 1 minute.Remove from heat and add some of the hot ice cream base to the matcha vodka mixture.  Stir until smooth and then add back to the rest of the ice cream base.Gradually whisk the hot milk mixture into the cream cheese until smooth.Pour the mixture into a 1-gallon Ziploc freezer bag and submerge the sealed bag in the ice bath. Let stand, adding more ice as necessary, until cold, about 30 minutes. Pour the ice cream base into the frozen canister and spin until thick and creamy.Pack the ice cream into a storage container, adding the matcha mochi bits in between layers of ice cream.  Press a sheet of parchment directly against the surface and seal with an airtight lid.  Freeze in the coldest part of your freezer until firm, at least 4 hours.Just like with mochi-wrapped ice cream, the mochi bits stay nice and pillowy soft even after frozen.  It makes an interesting contrast to the usual hard and crunchy mix-ins for ice creams.  And the amount of vodka used to dissolve the matcha powder was so minimal I can't even taste it in the ice cream.Next:  Almond Pesto PizzaPreviously:  Matcha Mochi Cupcakes"},

Please note that ovens may vary and you should start checking before the actual listed time is up. Test by inserting a toothpick or sharp metal object (e.g., a knife) into a muffin. If it comes out cleanly, it is done. The muffins are easier to remove if you let them cool first. However, if you've oiled the pan well enough, they should just slide out.Enjoy warm or at room temperature.Next:  Matcha Green Tea Ice Cream with Matcha Mochi BitsPreviously:  S'mores Brownie Ice Cream Sandwiches"},

Chill until cold.Take the brownie-cracker pans out of the freezer. Lift and peel the parchment paper to remove it from the pan. Then, line the pan again with parchment paper and invert the brownie and cracker back into the pan so that now, the cracker-layer is facing down and lining the pan. If you have trimmed/uneven cracker, take note of which sides the uneven crackers are. You’ll want to match the top and bottom layer so you can make even cuts later.When marshmallow mixture is cold, beat whipped cream to soft peaks and fold into the marshmallow base.Pour the ice cream batter on top of the brownie and smooth the top with a spoon.Arrange the crackers on top of the ice cream batter, making sure that the cracker arrangement matches the bottom cracker-layer (the uneven cracker pieces should be on the same side of the pan).Move the pan back into the freezer to harden, at least 8 hours to overnight.Cut between each crackers into little sandwiches. Wrap each with plastic wrap and store in the freezer.The texture of the toasted marshmallow ice cream was different from the churned ice creams I'm used to; it was a lot more airy and less creamy.  Normally I probably wouldn't have liked that, but I for this particular ice cream sandwich I think it works really well because it reminded me of a real marshmallow!Next:  Matcha Mochi CupcakesPreviously:  Cold Soba Noodle Salad with Baked Tofu and Edamame"},

To try to recreate that crust, I rolled out the dough instead of stretching it thin and decided to try making the pizza using the oven-fried method from the Modernist Cuisine at Home cookbook.  Warning:  this involves maneuvering a soft, sticky mass of dough topped with macaroni and cheese into a smoking hot pan of oil.  Proceed at your own risk.Oven-Fried Mac 'n' Cheese Pizzamakes 1 personal pan pizza8 oz. ball of pizza dough3/4 cup leftover macaroni and cheese2 tablespoons caramelized onions1 tablespoon bread crumbsOil for fryingTabasco or Frank's hot sauce (optional)Preheat the oven to 550°F.On a floured surface, roll the pizza dough out to a 10\" circle.Top with the macaroni and cheese, caramelized onions, and bread crumbs.Add enough oil to completely coat the bottom of a 10\" all-metal frying pan, the kind you can put in the oven without any plastic parts melting.  Heat on high until the oil just starts to smoke.Carefully slide the pizza into the pan using a pizza peel or a flexible cutting board.  Immediately transfer the pan to the oven.  Bake for 5 minutes.  After 5 minutes, turn the oven to broil and broil for two minutes.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly before cutting and serving.By keeping the pizza dough a little thicker and frying it in the pan, the crust becomes stable enough to stand up to heavier toppings like macaroni and cheese.  And even though you'll get a nice crispy crust on the bottom, you'll be surprised at how much oil is left in the pan, i.e. how little oil is absorbed by the pizza dough.I like to add a little Tabasco or Frank's hot sauce on top just for an extra kick.Next:  Backyard Mind Ice Cream with Dark Chocolate FrecklesPreviously:  Martha Stewart's Perfect Macaroni and Cheese"},

Butter a 9\"x12\" baking dish; set aside.Place bread pieces in a medium bowl.  Melt 2 tablespoons butter, pour over the bread, and toss. Set the breadcrumbs aside.In a medium saucepan set over medium heat, heat milk. Melt remaining 6 tablespoons butter in a high-sided skillet over medium heat. When butter bubbles, add flour. Cook, stirring, 1 minute.Slowly pour hot milk into flour-butter mixture while whisking. Continue cooking, whisking constantly, until the mixture bubbles and becomes thick.Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in salt, nutmeg, black pepper, cayenne pepper, 3 cups cheddar, and 1 1/2 cups Gruyere or 1 cup pecorino Romano. Set cheese sauce aside.Fill a large saucepan with water. Bring to a boil. Add macaroni; cook 2 to 3 fewer minutes than manufacturer's directions, until outside of pasta is cooked and inside is underdone. (Different brands of macaroni cook at different rates; be sure to read the instructions.)Transfer the macaroni to a colander, rinse under cold running water, and drain well. Stir macaroni into the reserved cheese sauce.Pour the mixture into the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle remaining 1 1/2 cups cheddar and 1/2 cup Gruyere or 1/4 cup pecorino Romano; scatter breadcrumbs over the top.Bake until browned on top, about 30 minutes. Transfer dish to a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes; serve.Even without any additions, I loved the result.  The cheddar and pecorino were sharp and strong, and the cayenne pepper added just the right amount of kick.  By undercooking the pasta by 2-3 minutes and finishing it up in the oven with the cheese sauce, the macaroni stays nice and firm and not mushy at all.  And the bread crumbs add a good amount of crunch for a change in texture.  Still, I think a little bacon fat in there would have been lovely.  ^_^If you happen to end up with any leftovers, you can use them to make an oven-fried mac 'n' cheese pizza!Next:  Oven-Fried Mac 'n' Cheese PizzaPreviously:  Vanilla Sugar Lemonade and Mint Lemonade Slushies"},

Add more sugar if you want to match the volume of lemon juice.  Add an equal volume of hot water to the sugar and stir until dissolved to make a simple syrup.Add the lemon juice and simple syrup to a pitcher or bottle.  Dilute with enough cold water to taste.  I add about 4 parts cold water to 1 part lemon juice/simple syrup solution.  It's still just the tiniest bit too strong for me to drink straight up but perfect once you add a few cubes of ice.  =)*To make the vanilla sugar, I've been adding the spent vanilla bean pods to an air-tight container of sugar every time I make something that uses fresh vanilla beans.  After letting it sit there for a few days, the sugar absorbs the scent of the vanilla and becomes vanilla sugar!  You can use it in just about anything sweet:  cookies, cakes, ice cream, etc.Then a couple of days ago I get a text from my friend Paula asking me if I wanted any of the mint she and her family had just picked from their backyard!  I immediately accepted even though I wasn't sure what I would do with it yet.  Then when I was making my third batch of lemonade in probably as many days, I started wondering if maybe I could rub the mint with the sugar and add some mint flavor to the lemonade that way. So after rubbing the lemons in the sugar, I dropped in a handful of mint leaves and rubbed those all around.  I left the leaves in the sugar while pouring the hot water in and let it steep for a bit before straining out the leaves.  I found that I was able to extract a lot of the mint flavor this way without having to leave the mint leaves in the actual lemonade.  And if you really like the taste of mint, I'd recommend tearing the mint leaves up before adding them to the sugar to release even more oils.To take it one step further, I decided to blend the mint lemonade with some ice to make a mint lemonade slushie, inspired by Ilene's post.

But which French toast?Molly from Orangette swears by frying her French toast in oil whereas the popular consensus is to use butter.  I decided to compare the two for myself, taking the extra step of browning the butter first for some added flavor.  And since I had some leftover bacon fat from making the BLTs, I figured I'd try frying some French toast in that as well.  What we have now, my friends, is a French Toast Face Off.As you can see, isn't a lot of difference in the three visually.  But once I started eating them, there was a world of a difference.  The browned butter-fried French toast was the most unremarkable of the three.  It didn't taste bad, it just didn't shine, and I couldn't even really taste the browned butter (although that might just be me because I can almost never taste browned butter).The winner of the three in terms of flavor was definitely the bacon fat-fried French toast.  This may come as no surprise since I love bacon, and you could definitely taste the smoky, salty flavor come through in full force here.But the overall winner for me was the oil-fried French toast.  This was the only French toast that developed a really nice crispy crust while retaining a soft, custardy interior.  For me, texture trumped flavor.  And if I really wanted bacon flavor with my French toast, I could just, you know, eat it with bacon.  =)French Toast (adapted from Orangette)Serves 1-21 egg plus 1 egg yolk1/2 cup milk1/2 tablespoon sugar1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract1/8 teaspoon saltPinch of freshly ground nutmeg6 to 8 day-old baguette slices, cut on the diagonal, about 3/4 inch thickCanola or other flavorless oilPure maple syrup, for servingWhisk together the first five ingredients in a wide, shallow bowl.Place a large skillet, preferably cast-iron, over low to medium heat, and add enough oil to completely cover the bottom of the skillet.Two or three at a time, add the bread slices to the egg mixture in the bowl, allowing them to rest for a minute or two on each side. They should feel heavy and thoroughly saturated, but they should not be falling apart.When the oil is hot, place the slices in the skillet. They should sizzle a bit, and the oil should bubble lightly around the edges of the bread; take care, however, that the oil is not too hot, lest the egg mixture burn.Cook until the underside of each slice is golden brown, about 2 minutes. Turn the bread, and cook until the second side is golden, another 2 minutes or so.Remove the bread from the skillet to a plate lined with a paper towel, allow to rest for 30 seconds or so, and serve immediately—with maple syrup, of course.Next:  Vanilla Sugar Lemonade and Mint Lemonade SlushiesPreviously:  Panzanella"},
{"title": "Panzanella", "date": "Monday, July 15, 2013", "text": "The first thing I thought of when I was trying to figure out how to use up the four foot baguette was panzanella, a salad made with stale bread cubes and tomatoes.  It's something I've been interested in making for a while but just never had enough bread to do so.  Well, problem solved.A quick search on the internet brought me to this post called \"The Best Panzanella You'll Ever Have\".  Good enough for me.  More importantly, this recipe didn't use cucumbers, which I'm not a big fan of.Panzanella (based on the recipe by Laura Wright of The First Mess)Serves 6-8For the croutons:4 cups cubed bread (about ½ inch cubes)1 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oilSalt and pepper to tasteFor the salad:5 cups halved cherry tomatoes (about 2 to 3 pints)3 tablespoons red wine vinegar¼ cup extra virgin olive oil1 small shallot, peeled and finely diced (or ¼ cup fine diced red onion)1 garlic clove, peeled and mincedSalt and pepper to taste1 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves (from 4 to 5 sprigs)Fresh mozzarella (optional)Preheat the oven to 400ºF.Place the bread cubes on a large, parchment of Silpat-lined baking sheet. Drizzle bread cubes with the 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Lightly toss bread cubes to coat in the oil and seasoning.Place coated bread cubes in the oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until croutons are golden brown and crunchy. Remove and set aside.In a large bowl, combine the cut tomatoes, red wine vinegar, olive oil, diced shallots, garlic, salt and pepper to taste.Stir to combine. Allow this mixture to sit for at least 10 minutes. The longer it sits, the juicier the tomatoes will be.Toss the croutons with the dressed tomatoes in the large bowl. Allow this mixture to sit for about 15 minutes, stirring it up here and there to distribute the dressing.Transfer the tomatoes and croutons to your serving bowl. Roughly chop or tear the basil leaves and scatter them on top of the panzanella.  Add some fresh mozzarella if you like.You can keep any leftovers in the fridge for a few days; I think it actually tastes better the next day!Next:  A French Toast Face OffPreviously:  BLT with Avocado and Basil Mayonnaise"},

Process until finely chopped and relatively smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally. (Large, tough basil leaves will probably stay fairly chunky, which is fine.)Place the mayonnaise in a small bowl and whisk in the basil mixture until thoroughly combined.For the BLT:1/2 avocado1 teaspoon lemon juiceA pinch of salt6 slices bacon12 inch baguette, cut in half and split horizontally1 tomato, the best you can find2 handfuls chopped lettuce1/4 cup Basil MayonnaiseScoop out the avocado into a small bowl.  Add the lemon juice and salt and mash together.  Set aside.In a large, unheated skillet, add the bacon and enough water to completely cover the bottom of the pan.  Turn the heat to medium and allow the water to come to a boil.  Once the water has evaporated, continue to cook the bacon until the bottom has browned.  Flip the bacon using tongs and cook until crisp.  Drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Slice the tomatoes.Spread the basil mayonnaise on the bottom half of bread.  Top with the lettuce, tomato, and bacon. Spread the mashed avocado on the other half of bread and place on top.  Enjoy!I really liked how the chewy texture of the baguette went well with the crispiness of the bacon and lettuce and the creaminess of the avocado.  You can make this with plain white sandwich bread, too, but then I'd suggest toasting the bread so that it can stand up to all the fillings.Next:  PanzanellaPreviously:  Zuni Cafe's Fried Egg in Bread Crumbs"},

Grind into rough, uneven bread crumbs. Place the crumbs in a 6- to 8-inch nonstick pan, sprinkle with salt to taste, and then drizzle with the olive oil. Set the pan over medium heat. Let the crumbs warm through, then swirl the pan as they begin drying out -- which will make a quiet static-like sound. Stir once or twice.The moment you see the crumbs begin to color, quickly add the herbs if using, then crack the eggs directly onto the crumbs. Cover the pan with a lid and cook the egg until the top is just set.Slide onto a warm plate, then add the vinegar to the hot pan.

{"title": "Potatoes Boulangère", "date": "Wednesday, July 3, 2013", "text": "I got yet another pound of potatoes in my Boston Organics delivery and was trying to figure out a new way to eat it.  I love potatoes, but I was a little tired of having them crashed or dominoed.  Then while watching the season 1 premiere of Gordon Ramsay's The F Word, inspiration struck.  He made something called potatoes boulangère, which look like scalloped potatoes but without all the cheese or cream.  I had never heard of it before, and I didn't even know how to spell it, so I had to look up the episode to figure it out.Basically, you layer thinly sliced potatoes with onions and then braise the whole thing in the oven with some stock.  It's amazingly simple, but if you take the time of arrange the layers, can look very elegant.  I chose to follow the recipe from the James Beard Foundation which has you sweat the onions first until golden, adding a some depth to the flavor.  I also sprinkled in some chopped rosemary and thyme, adding another dimension of flavor. The addition of the stock and the braising method of cooking is what sets this dish apart from a potato galette.  The stock you add is absorbed by the potatoes and onions and really infuses it all with a nice shot of umami.  By braising it in the oven, you get a nice gradient of texture, from the crispy browned edges to the soft, melt-in-your-mouth layers in the middle.  It's so good I have to admit I ate half the dish in one sitting.Potatoes Boulangère (adapted from the James Beard Foundation)makes 2 servings2 medium-large potatoes3 tablespoons butter1 tablespoon oil1 medium onion1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary and/or thymeSalt and pepper, to taste1 cup of chicken, beef, or vegetable stockPreheat oven to 375ºF.Thinly slice the onion.Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and the oil in a skillet and add onions. Cook until golden and soft (not brown), shaking the pan occasionally. Drain, saving the liquid.Using a mandoline, slice the potatoes into paper-thin slices.  (I left the skin on this time, but you can also peel the skin off beforehand.)Liberally butter a 1-quart baking dish (I used a pie pan).Put in a layer of potatoes, followed by a layer of onions. Season with the chopped herbs, salt, and pepper.Continue to make layers of potatoes and onions, seasoning the layers, and end with a top layer of potatoes.Season with more chopped herbs, salt, and pepper and dot with remaining butter.Pour on the liquid from the onions and the stock.Bake about 30 or 40 minutes, until the liquid has been absorbed and the potatoes test tender with a fork.Honestly, you could just fill in all the bottom layers haphazardly and just make the top layer look all pretty, and you'd get the same effect!Next:  Zuni Cafe's Fried Eggs in Bread CrumbsPreviously:  Bubble Tea PopsiclesThree years ago:  Slow Cooker Bolognese Sauce"},

Add the tea bags, stir to combine, and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and let sit for 10 minutes.Remove the tea bags or tea sock, pressing the extra liquid from the bags or sock back into the pan, and discard the tea bags. Add the condensed milk and whisk until evenly combined. Using a slotted spoon, remove 1/3 cup of the pearls from the syrup and divide them among the pop molds. Fill the molds halfway with the milk tea base. Stir the boba around in the milk tea to make sure that there aren't any large clumps.  Freeze until the pops are almost solid, about 2 hours. Meanwhile, set the remaining pearls aside in the syrup at room temperature. Place the remaining milk tea base in the refrigerator.After 2 hours, drain the remaining tapioca pearls and divide them among the molds. Top with the remaining milk tea base.Stir the boba again to break up any clumps.  Insert the sticks and freeze until solid, at least 6 hours.I wasn't as enamored with the milk tea part of the popsicle.  It was a little too sweet and icy for me.  If I had to do it again, I might just freeze some straight up milk tea (maybe with a little more half & half added to it) if I wanted a popsicle or churn some milk tea ice cream with mini boba and use that to fill the popsicle molds for a bubble tea ice cream bar.Next:  Potatoes BoulangèrePreviously:  Ken Forkish's Same Day Straight Pizza DoughThree years ago:  Coconut Lime Sorbet"},
{"title": "Ken Forkish's Same-Day Straight Pizza Dough", "date": "Thursday, June 27, 2013", "text": "I've been making pizzas at home for a while now and have been pretty content with the thin crust pizza dough recipe from The Kitchn.  But one day on a whim, I decided to try the pizza dough recipe in Ken Forkish' Flour Water Salt Yeast cookbook, and now I can never go back.Sure, making the dough is a little more fussy, but the difference is amazing; with this recipe you get a super-thin crust with a chewy, poofy crust just like in a restaurant!  You can make the dough in the morning, shape it in the afternoon, and then make pizzas by early evening!  And if you let the dough rest a day or two in the fridge, it develops a wonderful flavor that makes it more than worth the wait.  After making this dough a few times, I feel like I've gotten the hang of it and just follow these 2 Post-Its:But until you've mastered the recipe too, here's the more detailed directions, which I've streamlined a little from the cookbook.Ken Forkish's Same-Day Straight Pizza Dough (adapted from Flour Water Salt Yeast)makes two 8 oz. balls of pizza dough (enough for two 10\" pizzas)250 g (about 1 1/2 cups) all-purpose flour175 g (about 3/4 cups) warm water, 90-95°F5 g (about 2 teaspoons) kosher salt0.5 g (about 1/8 teaspoon) instant dried yeastPlace the yeast and 1 tablespoon of the warm water in a small bowl and set aside.Combine the flour and remaining warm water in a large bowl. Mix by hand until just incorporated. Cover and let rest for 20-30 minutes.After it has rested, sprinkle the salt over the dough. Stir the yeast mixture with your finger, then pour over the dough.  Use a small piece of dough to wipe the remaining yeast goop from the small bowl, then add it back to the rest of the dough.Mix by hand, wetting your working hand before mixing so the dough doesn't stick to you.  (It's fine to rewet your hand three or four times while you mix.)Reach underneath the dough and grab about one-quarter of it.  Gently stretch this section of dough and fold it over the top to the other side of the dough.  Repeat three more times with the remaining dough, until the salt and yeast are fully enclosed.  This process is called applying a fold.Continue to mix the dough by alternating folding and pinching the dough with your fingers to simulate the motion performed by a dough hook when using a stand up mixer.  (I suppose you could just use a stand up mixer to knead the dough, but it really only takes me a few minutes, and the dough is so soft by this point that it's not a big deal at all).  Once all the ingredients have been fully incorporated, and you can't feel the grains of salt in the dough, cover and let rest.After 30-60 minutes, apply a fold to the dough to help develop the gluten. After folding, lightly coat the dough and the bottom of the bowl with olive oil to help prevent sticking. Cover and let rest until the dough is about double its original volume, about 6 hours after mixing.Moderately flour a work surface.  With floured hands, gently ease the dough out of the bowl onto the work surface in a somewhat even shape. Dust the entire top of the dough with flour, then cut it into 2 equal-size pieces.To shape the dough, apply a fold to each piece and then turn upside-down to seal the seam underneath. Cradle the dough in both hands and gently stretch the dough from the top towards the sides and then under, rotating several times so that there is a nice, tight, even tension around the dough ball.  Try not to degas the dough while doing this.At this point I transfer each ball of dough to its own sandwich bag, dribble in a little olive oil to coat, and let it rest in the fridge overnight, up to 2 days.  If you want to use it that day, let it rest at room temperature for 30-60 minutes and then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to make the dough easier to shape.When you're ready to use the pizza dough, place a pizza stone in the upper portion of your oven (about 8\" below the broiler) and preheat to 600°F or as high as your oven can go (mine only goes to 550°F).  After it has preheated, continue heating the pizza stone for another 30 minutes.Cover a peel or cutting board with parchment paper and lightly flour.  Remove the dough ball from the fridge and put it on the floured parchment paper.  Gently pat it down a bit to coat the bottom with flour.  Leaving about 1\"of the outer rim undeflated, punch down the middle, then flip the dough over and repeat.Using both hands, grab the rim and lift the dough so it hangs down vertically.  Let gravity pull the rest of the dough down and stretch it.  Run the rim between your hands, working all the way around the circumference of the dough several times.  Start stretching the rim between your hands while continuing to turn the dough, still letting the bottom of the dough pull down, expanding the surface.  Keep a close eye on the thickness of the dough; you want it thin, but you don't want it to tear or develop holes.Spread the dough on the floured parchment paper and run your hands around the perimeter to shape it into a round and work out the kinks.  Top the pizza with your desired toppings.Gently slide the pizza with the parchment paper onto the pizza stone.  Bake for 5 minutes, then switch to the broil setting and broil for 2 minutes, keeping a close eye on the pizza. Bake until the cheese is completely melted and the crust is golden with spots of brown and a few small spots of char.  Use tongs to slide the pizza with the parchment paper from the pizza stone onto a cutting board.  Slice and serve!The pizza above is a margherita pizza, which I learned in Rome was named after Queen Margherita.  The colors in the pizza--red, white, and green--are reflected in the Italian national flag.

{"title": "Passion Fruit Macarons:  Further Lessons in Humility", "date": "Monday, June 24, 2013", "text": "It had been over four years since I last made macarons, so when I found myself with four egg whites in the fridge I thought to myself, \"Self, maybe it's time to try making them again.\"  After all, in the intervening years I had acquired a Kitchen-Aid stand up mixer, a Silpat liner, proper pastry bags and tips, and a food scale.  Looking back, I can't believe I attempted to make macarons without any of those!Since I had previously tried making macarons using the Italian meringue method, I thought I'd try the French meringue method.  The French method may seem easier -- no need to dribble boiling hot sugar syrup into egg whites while beating (seriously, how did I do that without a stand-up mixer?!?) -- but the rate of failure is a lot higher since the meringue isn't quite as stable.The hardest part is knowing when to stop folding the batter, otherwise the macarons will crack or not develop the frilly \"feet\".  Believe me, it is heartbreaking to go through all the trouble of making the batter and piping the macarons and letting them rest, only to see them start to crack in the oven.  I was so nervous about over-mixing that I actually under-mixed the batter at first.  I realized my mistake when I tried piping it, and the batter wouldn't spread out into a nice round shape.  I scraped the batter in the bag back into the mixing bowl and gave it a few more folds before trying again, and it worked much better this time.For the filling, I decided to make a modified version of the Momofuku Milk Bar passion fruit curd by adding a little more gelatin and butter to make it more viscous.  Since I knew the passion fruit curd would be plenty flavorful, I chose to keep the macarons plain and just added some yellow gel coloring so that they would match the curd.  You'll want to make the curd first so that it has time to chill in the fridge before filling the macarons.Passion Fruit Curd (adapted from Momofuku Milk Bar)makes about 1 1/4 cups50 g passion fruit puree32 g sugar1 large egg1/3 teaspoon powdered gelatin1 tablespoon cold water8 tablespoons very cold butter1 g kosher saltPut the passion fruit puree and sugar in a blender and blend until the sugar granules have dissolved.  Add the egg and blend on low until you have a bright orange-yellow mixture.  Transfer the contents of the blender to a medium saucepan.  Clean the blender canister.Bloom the powdered gelatin in 1 tablespoon of cold water.Heat the passion fruit mixture over low heat, whisking regularly.  As it heats up, it will begin to thicken; keep a close eye on it.  Once the mixture boils, remove it from the stove and transfer back to the blender.Add the bloomed gelatin, butter, and salt and blend until the mixture is thick, shiny, and super-smooth.Transfer the mixture to a heatproof container and put it in the refrigerator for at least 30-60 minutes, until the curd has cooled completely.Passion Fruit Macarons (adapted from Tartelette and Lisa is Bossy)makes about 24110 g egg whites (about 4) 200 g confectioner's sugar110 g almond flour1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar25 g granulated sugar3 drops yellow gel food coloringPassion fruit curd (recipe above) Age the egg whites overnight at room temperature in an open container (I cover mine with a sieve to keep out dust but to allow air flow).Prepare two baking trays with Silpat or parchment paper. Sift the confectioner's sugar and almond flour together into a medium bowl.Add the cream of tartar to the egg whites and whip until foamy.  Add the granulated sugar a little at a time while still mixing.Once the egg whites have reached soft peak stage, add the food coloring and continue to beat until you reach stiff peak stage.Add the almond sugar mixture to the egg whites and fold until all the dry ingredients have been incorporated.Continue folding until the batter is smooth but not stiff or runny.  Test a small amount on a plate: if the tops flattens on its own you are good to go. If there is a small peak, give the batter a couple of turns.Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip.  If using parchment paper, pipe a dot onto each corner of the baking tray so that the parchment paper sticks to it.  Pipe 1\" circles, leaving about an inch in between each.  You should be able to fit six rows of four macarons on each tray by staggering them.Tap the tray sharply several times so that any air bubbles are released.  Allow the macarons to sit for 30-60 minutes so that a \"skin\" develops on top.Preheat the oven to 310°F.  Bake the macarons for 12 minutes*.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.Once cool, match similarly sized and shaped macarons with each other. Transfer the passion fruit curd to a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip.  Pipe a spiral of curd onto the bottom half and top with the matching macaron.  Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.*I ended up losing about half my macarons to cracks, and of the leftover macarons, most of them were undercooked and stuck to the parchment paper.  Sadly, I was only able to salvage 8 macarons out of the whole batch.  I increased the baking time in the recipe above by a minute to account for this, but you should learn from my mistake and test a macaron before removing the whole tray from the oven.  Try shifting one along the tray; if it doesn't budge, let it bake a little more.  If it moves, they're done!Even if you have some aesthetic failures, they still taste great with any leftover passion fruit curd!Next:  Ken Forkish's Same Day Straight Pizza DoughPreviously:  Mango Coconut Rice Pudding PopsThree years ago:  Bacon Caramel Maple Ice Cream"},

The creamy coconut milk and bright mango bits complement each other, and the rice gives it a nice chewiness.  My favorite part, though, is the sweetened condensed milk that kind of floats to the top of the mold (and therefore ends up at the bottom of the popsicle) giving it the perfect ending.  Mango Coconut Rice Pudding Pops and Ice Cream (adapted from The Kitchn)makes six 2 oz. popsicles and about a quart of ice creamOne 15-ounce can coconut milk, shaken1/2 vanilla bean, halved lengthwise1/2 cup short-grain or arborio rice1 cup sweetened condensed milk1 cup water1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract1/4 teaspoon coconut extract (optional)1/4 teaspoon kosher salt1 cup fresh or frozen mango, diced1/4 cup heavy cream (for the ice cream)Add the contents of the can of coconut milk into a large saucepan. Scrape the seeds out of the vanilla bean and stir in. Stir in the rice, and bring the whole mixture to a simmer over medium heat. Turn the heat down to low and cook for about 25 minutes, or until the rice is tender.  Whisk in the sweetened condensed milk, water, vanilla extract, coconut extract (if using), and salt.  Fold the mango into the rice mixture.Transfer the rice and mango mixture to six 2-ounce popsicle molds. Insert sticks and freeze until solid — 3 to 4 hours.  To release the pops from the molds, run the molds briefly under warm water.Add the rest of the mixture to an ice cream machine and churn according to the manufacturer's directions.  Transfer the ice cream to an air-tight container and freeze for at least 4 hours to harden.Next:  Passion Fruit MacaronsPreviously:   Homemade CronutsThree years ago:  World Peace Cookies"},
{"title": "Homemade Cronuts", "date": "Monday, June 17, 2013", "text": "I got a request from a friend last week to make some cronuts so that he would know whether or not they were worth waiting in line for at Dominique Ansel's bakery.  If you haven't heard of the cronut yet, it's a cross between a croissant and a donut created by Ansel.  Basically, croissant dough is cut into a donut shape, deep-fried, filled with pastry cream, and then glazed on top.  Only 200-250 are made a day so now there's a whole black market for them with some scalpers selling them for upwards of $40 per cronut (normally priced at $5).  Crazy, right?At first I was hesitant to make my own because from my previous experience with making croissants, it would take at least 2.5 days, but then while surfing the web for other bloggers' attempts at home, I found this post using \"20 minutes croissant dough\".  That sounded much more feasible!I made a few changes to the original recipe:  instead of using a food processor to cut the butter into the flour, I grated frozen sticks of butter and then added that to the flour mixture, partly because my food processor is too small to handle the volume of butter and flour in the recipe and partly because it was fun to do.Instead of using caster sugar (a finer sugar than granulated, but not as fine as confectioner's), I used plain granulated sugar for the lemon sugar.  I realized my mistake when I had a hard time making the lemon sugar stick to the just-fried donuts.  Since caster sugar isn't readily available in the States, I'd recommend using a food processor to grind regular granulated sugar into a super-fine, but not powdered, consistency.Lastly, I tried making the filling in the recipe, but it came out way too thin and drippy for me to consider piping into the cronut.  I guess I was expecting something more the consistency of the cream inside a Dunkin' Donuts Boston Cream donut, which is basically pudding-like.  The filling I made was already dripping out of the pastry bag before I could even apply any pressure to it!  So I ended up just rolling the cronuts in the lemon sugar and glazing it with the lemon icing.  I think it would've been nice to have had a cream filling, but it was fine without it, too. Lemon Glazed Cronuts (adapted from The Boy Who Bakes)makes about 10 large cronut, 6 medium size cronuts and 16 mini-cronutsFor the cronuts 120 ml milk, 90-95°F130 ml water, 90-95°F12 g dry active yeast 250 g all-purpose flour250 g bread flour60 g sugar1 teaspoon salt300 g unsalted butter, frozenFor the lemon sugar and glaze 75 g sugar1 lemonConfectioner's sugarPlace the milk, water and yeast into a small bowl and mix to combine, set aside. Place the flours, sugar, and salt into a large bowl and mix to combine.Grate the butter using the largest holes of a grater and toss with the flour mixture once you get a handful grated butter.  Keep grating and tossing with the flour mixture so that the butter doesn't clump together.Once all the butter has been tossed into the flour mixture, add the yeast solution and stir gently just until combined, trying to moisten everything without making the butter any smaller. Gently knead the dough until it comes together into a ball.  Cover the bowl and let the dough rest in the refrigerator for a few hours.After the dough has rested place it on a well floured work surface. Roll the dough out into a roughly 15\"x15\" square. Fold the dough in thirds, like a business letter, brushing off any excess flour.  Turn the dough 90° and repeat the rolling,folding, and rotating process two more times, giving the dough a total of three turns.Using a sharp knife, cut the rectangle in half crosswise.  Wrap both pieces of dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight before using.The next day, roll out one of the two pieces of dough to about 1 cm thick, much thicker than you would roll the dough if making a croissant. Using a 3 1/2\" cookie cutter (I used a large jar lid), cut out 5 donuts and then using a 1\" cutter cut out the holes.If you want, cut out a hole in the 1\" circle with a straw to make mini-cronuts.  I also cut out medium-sized cronuts from the scrap dough.  Repeat with the other piece of dough.  Allow the cronuts to proof at room temperature while you prepare the lemon sugar and lemon glaze.To make the lemon sugar, add the sugar to a food processor and grind until the sugar has a super-fine consistency but is not yet powdered.  Carefully empty the contents into a wide bowl.  Zest the lemon, and add the lemon zest to the sugar.  Rub the zest and the sugar together until thoroughly mixed.  Cover and set aside.To make the glaze, juice the lemon.  Add enough confectioner's sugar to the lemon juice until you have a thick, pipeable mixture; you are looking for a thickness similar to toothpaste. I think I ended up using over 2 cups of confectioner's sugar, although I stopped keeping track after a while.  Press plastic wrap onto the surface of the glaze to prevent it crusting over and set aside until needed.When ready to fry fill a thick bottomed saucepan two thirds full with vegetable oil and place over medium heat and bring to 170°C. When at temperature fry the cronuts two at a time (I also put in a few of the smaller cronuts in at the same time). Fry the cronuts for a couple minutes each side, or until deep golden brown. Using a metal slotted spoon remove from the pan and place onto a wire rack set over paper towels. Once cooled enough to handle roll the outside of the cronuts in the lemon sugar, set aside to cool completely. For the decoration place the glaze into a piping bag, snip off the end, and pipe a ring around the top.  Serve immediately.So the verdict?  When I took my first bite, it reminded me of something else, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  Then I realized, it tasted a lot like the sugared donut holes you sometimes see at Chinese buffets.  Which, don't get me wrong, are delicious.  But I'm not sure making a cronut was worth all the effort, even though I had only made a simplified version.As you can see from the cross-section, I didn't really get the layers you expect from a croissant dough, although there was definitely plenty of air pockets.  If anything, the texture reminded me of the lilikoi malasadas I made, which while really delicious, are definitely not worth $40.If I were to ever really crave a cronut, I'd probably just pick up a package of frozen croissants from Trader Joe's, thaw them in the fridge, roll and cut them out, and then let them proof before frying them.Update:  So the other day while I was cleaning out my freezer, I happened upon some of the homemade croissant dough that I had stashed away and forgotten about.  I saw no other option than to try making cronuts out of it, and the result was drastically different than my above attempt with the \"20 minute\" croissant dough.  Just look at this:Even without a pretty ring of glaze you can immediately see how much better it looks with all the different layers.  The texture was a lot crispier, and my friend Christine took to eating her cronut layer by layer, which would've been impossible with the other cronuts I made.  This time I also filled the middle with some coconut whipped cream sweetened with lemon sugar.  The whole thing was still a little too greasy for me, but I'm glad I tried it out nonetheless.Next:  Mango Coconut Rice Pudding PopsPreviously:  Bucatini all'AmatricianaThree years ago:  Elote (Grilled Mexican Corn)"},
{"title": "Bucatini all'Amatriciana", "date": "Friday, June 14, 2013", "text": "It was our last day in Rome, and I knew exactly what I wanted to eat for dinner:  bucatini all'amatriciana.  I had read that, along with spaghetti carbonara, it was another pasta specialty of Rome.  Bucatini is a long, hollow pasta, kind of like a very narrow straw.  Cooking it all'amatriciana means pairing it with a tomato, guanciale, and pecorina based sauce.  I really wanted to try this fun new shape of pasta, and after having tasted what guanciale can do for carbonara, really wanted to taste it in a tomato sauce.It was only late afternoon, way too early for a proper Italian dinner, but we had to catch the shuttle back to our hotel, so we found a sidewalk cafe in between two gelaterias we wanted to try:  Grom and Giolitti.  The restaurant's menu advertised a special for bucatini all'amatriciana along with bruschetta and a drink.  Ces and I decided to share the special, and I ordered a Fanta, which in Rome was much more like an Orangina than the disgustingly artificial Fanta we have in the States.The bucatini came out, and we tucked in.  To say that we liked it would be a gross understatement.  It was so good, I totally forgot to take a picture of it.  I didn't even take down the name of the restaurant, and sadly, I can't seem to find it on Google Maps even though I know exactly where it is.  The bucatini was as fun to eat as I imagined, and the taste of the sauce haunted me all the way through customs in America.I knew I had to try to make it back home, and luckily I had found a box of bucatini at a grocery store in Rome for only 89 cents.  There were a couple of different packages of bucatini at the Fiumicino airport going for €4-5, and I was almost tempted to pick up another package.  Thankfully, I didn't, because I managed to find two brands of bucatini being sold at Wegmans, and for much cheaper!  Isn't Wegmans the best?Bucatini all'Amatriciana (adapted from Bon Appétit)makes 4 servings2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil4 oz. thinly sliced guanciale, pancetta, or chopped unsmoked bacon1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper3/4 cup minced onion2 cloves garlic, minced1 28-oz. can peeled tomatoes with juices, crushed by handKosher salt12 oz. dried bucatini1/4 cup finely grated Pecorino (about 1 oz.) Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add guanciale and sauté until crisp and golden, about 4 minutes. Add pepper flakes and black pepper; stir for 10 seconds. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring often, until soft, about 8 minutes.   Add tomatoes, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, 15-20 minutes.  If desired, purée the sauce in a blender or with an immersion blender.  Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season with salt; add the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, for 9 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of pasta cooking water.Add drained pasta to sauce in skillet and toss vigorously with tongs to coat. Add 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water and cook until sauce coats pasta and pasta is al dente, about 2 minutes. (Add a little pasta water if sauce is too dry.) Stir in cheese and serve.Updated:  Wow.  I just heated some leftovers up in the microwave for lunch today, and dare I say, it was even better?  Whatever loss of texture there might have been in the bucatini from the nuking was more than made up for by the guanciale regaining the crispness it had lost while simmering in the sauce.  Wow.  I can't wait to make this again just so I can eat it as a leftover!

{"title": "Spaghetti Carbonara for One", "date": "Tuesday, June 11, 2013", "text": "Our first stop in Rome was the Piazza Navona, known for its beautiful Bernini fountains, artists plying their wares, and the overpriced cafes lining the square.  Even though we were hungry, I didn't want to just settle for a potential tourist trap, so I asked one of the artists for his recommendation for lunch.Him and his friends pointed us towards Ristorante Corallo, just a couple of blocks away from the piazza.  He mentioned that it was better than \"baffeto\" which at the time I thought meant \"buffet\" but later on realized was a reference to Pizzeria Baffeto, often listed as one of the best places for pizza in Rome and right around the corner from Corallo.I really wanted to try a pizza in Rome, which is known for having an ultra-thin crust, so I ordered a pizza margherita to share.  Seeing another Roman specialty on the menu, I suggested that Ces order the spaghetti carbonara for us to share as well.  The pizza was good, although I noticed a distinct lack of basil.  It came without basil when I ordered it from a different restaurant the next day, too, so I guess that's just how pizza margherita is served in Rome.I knew carbonara meant a bacon and egg sauce, but I was unprepared for how it would actually taste.  It was oh so silky and creamy without actually containing any cream, but the highlight was definitely the bacon.  It tasted different from the bacon I was used to having back in the States.  I knew I had to try to recreate the dish at home, but lamented to myself that I probably wouldn't be able to find the same type of bacon there.After a little more research, I found out that the type of meat used was actually guanciale, made from cured pig jowl vs. traditional bacon, which is made from pork belly.  Luckily in Boston, there are quite a few places that carry guanciale including Formaggio Kitchen and Savenor's.  If you can't find it, you can try substituting pancetta, and if you can't find that, bacon.On a recent night, I was really craving some spaghetti carbonara for myself so I googled \"single serving carbonara\" and this was the first link returned.  It looked simple enough and made a pretty tasty dish, but I modified it just a little the second time I made it so it was more like what I remembered tasting in Rome.There's a lot I like about this recipe:  it falls under the category of comfort food and comes together rather quickly with a minimum of ingredients, most of which you probably already have on hand.  You do need to serve and eat this immediately, but since you're just making it for yourself, that's not a problem!Spaghetti Carbonara for One (adapted from Greg's Food)makes 1 serving, duh2 slices guanciale, chopped1 clove garlic, minced1 serving uncooked spaghetti (for me that's a between a dime and a nickel's circumference of pasta)1 teaspoon olive oil  1 egg1 tablespoon fresh grated parmesan, plus more to tasteSalt and pepper to taste Chopped parsley (optional)Bring a pot of salted water to boil.  In the meantime, chop the guanciale and mince the garlic.Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the spaghetti and cook for 9 minutes, stirring occasionally so the pasta doesn't stick to itself.Add the guanciale to an unheated saucepan and place on medium heat.  Once some fat has rendered out and the guanciale is starting to look translucent, add the olive oil and minced garlic.  Continue to cook until browned but not burnt, lowering the heat if you have to.In the meantime, break an egg into a large soup bowl.  Add the tablespoon of parmesan cheese and whisk until well mixed.Once the spaghetti is done, use a pasta scoop to transfer the pasta to the saucepan with the bacon and garlic in it, letting most of the water drain off while you do so.  Lower the heat under the saucepan and toss the pasta around to cover it with the hot grease.Whisk the egg and cheese again real quick and then carefully add the contents of the saucepan into the bowl.  Start tossing the spaghetti with the egg mixture to cook it without curdling.Once the sauce comes together, add salt and pepper to taste and top with any guanciale left in the saucepan and additional parmesan and/or parsley if you like.  If the sauce is too thick for your liking, add a little of the pasta water to thin it out.  Serve immediately.Next:  Bucatini all'AmatricianaPreviously:  Rosemary Honey & Lemon Frozen YogurtFour years ago:  Kale Chips"},
{"title": "Rosemary Honey and Lemon Frozen Yogurt", "date": "Thursday, June 6, 2013", "text": "I'm back, both figuratively and literally!  I got back last week from a 2 week vacation to Europe.  My friend, Ces, and I went on a Celebrity cruise to Italy, Greece, and Turkey and then stayed an extra couple of days in Rome.  Being on a cruise, we definitely ate our fill, but the most memorable food I ate was all in Rome.Before we had left for the trip, I had looked up the best gelato in Rome to make sure that we didn't waste any space in our tummies on inferior product.  We tried San Crispino when we were at the Trevi Fountain and Grom near(ish) the Pantheon, but the one that blew me away was Gelateria del Teatro, in between Piazza Navona and Ponte Sant'Angelo. I chose the Rosemary Honey and Lemon and Sicilian Almond flavors and could not stop raving about them while we made our way to the Vatican.  I love almond flavored anything, and this was the first time that I had tasted an ice cream that really captured the pure almond flavor without tasting buttery or artificial.  And the rosemary was an unexpected first note that mellowed out with the honey and lemon in a way that was completely and perfectly balanced.  Ask Ces; I think I actually stopped walking several times because I was just enjoying the gelato so much.  It was so good we went back for a second round after returning from the Vatican! I knew I had to try to make the rosemary honey lemon flavor when I got home so I pulled out Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home and searched for a honey flavored base but didn't find one.  So I tried using her ice cream base, substituted honey for the sugar, and steeped the mixture with rosemary and lemon peel before thickening it.  It ended up tasting way too sweet for me, and I think the honey kept it a little softer than I would have liked.  I decided to try making it again with less honey and using the frozen yogurt base to lighten it up a little and give it a little more tang.  I was really pleased with this version; it's not an exact duplicate of the gelato from Rome, but I think it's just as good!Rosemary Honey and Lemon Frozen Yogurt (based on on the Frozen Yogurt Base from Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home)makes about 1 quart1 1/2 cup whole milk2 tablespoons cornstarch2 ounces cream cheese, softened1/2 cup heavy cream1/2 cup honey plus more, to taste2 tablespoons light corn syrup2 sprigs fresh rosemaryZest from half a lemon1 1/4 cup Greek yogurt (I used 2% low fat, but I think nonfat and regular would work fine)Mix about 3 tablespoons of the milk with the cornstarch in a small bowl to make a smooth slurry.  Whisk the cream cheese in a medium bowl until smooth.  Fill a large bowl with ice and water.Combine the remaining milk, cream, honey, and corn syrup in a 4-quart saucepan, bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat, and boil for 4 minutes.  Remove from heat, add the rosemary and lemon zest, and let steep for 20 minutes.Remove the rosemary and zest with a slotted spoon.  Taste the mixture; if it's not sweet enough, add some more honey (I ended up adding about another tablespoon).  Gradually whisk in the cornstarch mixture and return the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat.  Cook, stirring until slightly thickened, about 1 minute.  Remove from heat.Gradually whisk the hot milk mixture into the cream cheese until smooth.  Add the yogurt and blend well.Pour the mixture into a 1-gallon Ziploc freezer bag and submerge the sealed bag in the ice bath.  Let stand, adding more ice as necessary, until cold, about 30 minutes.Pour the frozen yogurt base into the frozen canister and spin until thick and creamy.Pack the frozen yogurt into a storage container, press a sheet of parchment directly against the surface, and seal with an airtight lid.  Freeze in the coldest part of your freezer until firm, at least 4 hours.Next:  Spaghetti Carbonara for OnePreviously:  Happiness CakeFour years ago:  Black Sesame Ice Cream"},
{"title": "Happiness Cake", "date": "Friday, March 8, 2013", "text": "I've been wanting to make this cake ever since I first saw it in the Momofuku Milk Bar cookbook where it's just called a Chocolate Chip Layer Cake.  I think that simple name does not even begin to describe what it is:  mini chocolate chip butter cake layered with passion fruit curd, chocolate cake crumbs, and coffee buttercream frosting.  Hello.  So I decided to rename it Happiness Cake, because this is what happiness is.  =)The main reason why it took me so long to make this cake is because according to the cookbook, you needed a cake ring and acetate lining to build up the layers.  I wasn't interested in acquiring any more random stuff for my kitchen so I just kept drooling over the recipe but not making it.  At one point I started thinking about making it into a cupcake form, but then I got the bright idea to just put all the layers in small Mason jars, which I already had!  I love that they can be kept in the freezer for a while and are totally portable, so they make really good gifts for friends! There are a lot of different parts to this cake, and some parts take more time than others and need to chill before using or need to use immediately, so this is how I would suggest going about it:Make the cake and put it in the oven to bake.While the cake is baking, make the passion fruit curd and let it chill in the fridge.After the cake is done, let it cool and lower the oven temperature to 300°F.  Make the chocolate crumbs, which will also need to cool after baking.Just before you are ready to assemble everything, start making the coffee frosting.  This will take a while to come together, so you can go ahead and start with the assembly process while you are waiting.Another note about the coffee frosting, even after mixing in my stand mixer for more than half an hour, I still wasn't getting it to come together, so eventually I just poured out the liquid coffee milk that was left and paddled until everything was homogenous.  Then I found that I needed a lot more of the coffee frosting than the original recipe called for, so in the recipe below, I increased the amount of frosting but decreased the coffee milk to butter ratio a little.After assembling the 6 jars, you'll end up with a lot of leftover components.  Feel free to make a Happiness Scrap Heap out of them just for yourself or, if you have more jars, you can try making more Happiness Cakes, just without the perfect circles.  Happiness Cake (adapted from Momofuku Milk Bar)makes 6 small (8 oz.) jars with lots of leftover scraps perfect for snacking on1 recipe Chocolate Chip Cake (below)1/3 cup passion fruit puree1 recipe Passion Fruit Curd (below)1 recipe Chocolate Crumbs (below)1 recipe Coffee Frosting (below)Chocolate Chip Cakemakes one 9\"x13\" cake1/2 cup butter, at room temperature1 1/4 cup sugar1/4 cup light brown sugar, tightly packed3 eggs1/2 cup buttermilk1/2 cup canola oil1 tablespoon vanilla extract1 1/2 cups cake flour1 teaspoon baking powder1 teaspoon kosher saltNonstick cooking spray 3/4 cup mini chocolate chipsPreheat oven to 350°F.Combine the butter and sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and cream together on medium-high for 2-3 minutes.  Add eggs and mix on medium-high again for 2-3 minutes.On low speed, stream in the buttermilk, oil, and vanilla.  Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and paddle for 4-6 minutes, until the mixture is practically white, twice the size of your original fluffy butter-and-sugar mixture, and completely homogenous.  On very low speed, add the cake flour, baking powder, and salt.  Mix for 45-60 seconds, just until your batter comes together and any remnants of dry ingredients have been incorporated. Spray a 9\"x13\" pan with nonstick cooking spray and line with a piece of parchment paper.  Using a spatula, spread the cake batter in an even layer in the pan.  Give the bottom of the pan a tap on the counter top to even out the layer.  Sprinkle the chocolate chips evenly over the cake batter. Bake the cake for 30-35 minutes.  At 30 minutes, gently poke the edge of the cake with your finger; the cake should bounce back slightly and the center should no longer be jiggly.  Leave the cake in the oven for an extra 3-5 minutes if it doesn't pass these tests. Take the cake out of the oven and cool on a wire rack, or in a pinch, in the fridge, freezer, or snow (just make sure, you know, it's stopped snowing).  The cooled cake can be stored in the fridge, wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 5 days.Passion Fruit Curdmakes about 1 1/2 cups1/2 cup passion fruit puree1/3 cup sugar2 eggs1/2 teaspoon powdered gelatin3/4 cup butter, very cold1/2 teaspoon kosher saltPut the passion fruit puree and sugar in a blender and blend until the sugar granules have dissolved.  Add the eggs and blend on low until you have a bright-orange-yellow mixutre.  Transfer the contents of the blender to a medium saucepan.  Clean the blender canister.Bloom the powdered gelatin in 2 tablespoons of cold water. Heat the passion fruit mixture over low heat, whisking regularly.  Once it boils, remove it from the stove and transfer it to the blender.  Add the bloomed gelatin, butter, and salt and blend until the mixture is thick, shiny, and super-smooth. Transfer the mixture to a heatproof container and put in the fridge until the curd has cooled completely, at least 30 minutes.  The curd can be refrigerated for up to 1 week; do not freeze.Chocolate Crumbsmakes about 1 1/4 cup1/3 cup flour1/2 teaspoon cornstarch1/4 cup sugar1/3 cup cocoa powder1/2 teaspoon kosher salt3 tablespoons butter, meltedPreheat the oven to 300°F.Combine the flour, cornstarch, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and paddle on low speed until mixed.Add the butter and paddle on low speed until the mixture starts to come together in small clusters. Spread the clusters on a parchment- or Silpat-lined baking sheet.  Bake for 20 minutes, breaking them up occasionally.   The crumbs should still be slightly moist to the touch at that point; they will dry and harden as they cool.Let the crumbs cool completely before using.  Stored in an airtight container, they will keep fresh for 1 week at room temperature or 1 month in the fridge or freezer.Coffee Frostingmakes about 2 cups1 cup butter, at room temperature1/2 cup confectioners' sugar1/3 cup milk1 1/2 teaspoons instant espresso powder1/2 teaspoon saltCombine the butter and confectioners' sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and cream together on medium-high for 2-3 minutes, until fluffy and pale yellow.Meanwhile, make a quick coffee milk:  whisk together the milk, instant espresso powder, and salt in a small bowl. On low speed, gradually stream in the coffee milk.  You are essentially forcing liquid into fat, so be patient.  The butter mixture will clump up and separate upon contact with the coffee milk.   Do not stream more coffee milk into the butter mixture until the previous addition is fully incorporated; keep the mixer on and remain patient.  The result will be a wildly fluffy coffee frosting, pale brown, and super-shiny.  Use immediately. Happiness Cake in a Jar Assembly Using an empty jar as a cookie cutter, cut out 12 circles from the chocolate chip cake.  (Yes, there are 13 circles cut out above.  I had to eat one.  For science.) Press one circle into the bottom of a jar.  Brush with a generous amount of passion fruit puree. Spoon in a layer of the passion fruit curd.  Top with a layer of the chocolate crumbs. Carefully spread a layer of the coffee frosting on top. Repeat with another layer of cake, passion fruit puree, passion fruit curd, and chocolate crumbs. Finish with a final layer of coffee frosting. Repeat with the remaining 5 jars.  Cover and place in the freezer for at least 12 hours to set the cake and filling.  The cakes will keep in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.  Defrost in the fridge for at least 3 hours before serving. Dig in with a spoon and experience happiness.Next:  Rosemary Honey & Lemon Frozen YogurtPreviously:  Peking Duck PizzaFour years ago:  Panna Cotta, Take 2; The Feng Family Secret Peking Duck Recipe; Korean Pancake Face Off"},

If you don't have a baking stone, bake the pizza right on the baking sheet.Bake for about 5 minutes and then rotate the pizza.

{"title": "Cauliflower Steak with Cauliflower Purée", "date": "Thursday, February 21, 2013", "text": "On the other side of the spectrum from the previous post, I knew I had to try making Dan Barber's Cauliflower Steak with Cauliflower Purée as soon as I saw it on Food52.  I've always liked cauliflower but never gotten it in any Boston Organics deliveries.  Seeing this recipe made me decide to stop waiting and go out and buy some (and luckily, cauliflower's on sale at Trader Joe's at the moment).I knew the name Dan Barber sounded familiar to me, but I couldn't quite figure out how I had heard of him until I remembered that his TED talk on foie gras was the first TED talk I ever watched!  I've also watched his TED talk on fish, and I would highly suggest watching them both.  I don't know; there's just something about the way he talks--it's simple but also so very sincere.  You won't regret it. Anyways, back to this dish, which is really all about the cauliflower.  You can get two nice, inch-thick \"steaks\" out of a head of cauliflower, which are then caramelized on a hot pan.  The rest of the florets are cooked in milk and water and then puréed in a blender.  Even though there's a bare minimum of ingredients, the two different cooking techniques make a pretty big difference in the taste of the two preparations of cauliflower.  Plus, it looks really cool plated!I decided to finish the dish with a sprinkle of truffle salt--not enough to overpower the delicate cauliflower flavor, but just enough to keep it out of the boring territory. Cauliflower Steak with Cauliflower Purée (adapted from Food52)serves 2One 1 1/2 lb. head of cauliflower1 1/2 cups water1 cup milk2 tablespoons oil plus more for brushingSalt and freshly ground pepperTruffle salt (optional) Heat oven to 350°F. Using sharp heavy knife and starting at top center of cauliflower head, cut two 1-inch-thick slices of cauliflower, cutting through stem end. Set cauliflower steaks aside. Cut enough florets from remaining cauliflower head to measure 3 cups. Combine florets, water, and milk in medium saucepan, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bring to boil and cook until cauliflower florets are very tender, about 10 minutes. Strain, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid. Transfer florets to blender. Add half of the reserved 1 cup cooking liquid and purée until smooth. Add more of the liquid if desired, and purée again. Return purée to same saucepan. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in heavy large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Brush cauliflower steaks with additional oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add cauliflower steaks to skillet and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Cover the pan with a splatter screen, if you have one.  Transfer skillet to oven and bake cauliflower steaks until tender, about 10 minutes. Rewarm cauliflower purée over medium heat. Divide purée between two plates; top each with cauliflower steak.  Sprinkle a pinch of truffle salt on top and serve. Personally, I would have liked a little more acid in the dish; maybe a reduction of balsamic vinegar drizzled over the top.  It would make a nice striking contrast against all the white, too! Next:  Kale and Sweet Potato SoupPreviously:  Jjajungmyeon (Korean Black Bean Noodles)Three years ago:  Faux Momofuku Brussels Sprouts Four years ago: Boston Cream Cupcakes, One Avocado Ice Cream"},

{"title": "Potato Dominoes", "date": "Wednesday, February 13, 2013", "text": "I've made potatoes french fried, hashed, crashed, mashed on a pizza, and even mashed in a St. Patrick's Day maki roll, but never have I ever heard of making them dominoed before.  Then all within the span of one day, I read two separate posts about Francis Mallmann's Potato Dominoes.  Coincidence?  I think not.They're basically potatoes cut into rectangular blocks, then sliced thinly into something like a deck of cards.  Then they're roasted with clarified butter and some salt.  That's it! The great thing about making potatoes this way is that it totally works for potatoes that may have been sitting around a little too long.  You know the ones I'm talking about--the ones that have little (or maybe not so little) growths in the eyes--the same ones that you may just throw away in a couple of days.  The genius of this recipe is that in order to get the potatoes into that block shape, you end up cutting off a lot of the outside.  While with normal potatoes this would seem like a waste (although you could always save them to make oven fries or loaded potato skins), with the old, squidgy potatoes, you'd be cutting all that off anyways! Potato Dominoes (adapted from Seven Fires:  Grilling the Argentine Way)serves 1-21/4 cup unsalted butter 1 lb. potatoesCoarse salt Make clarified butter by slowly melting the butter in a small heavy saucepan over medium-low heat; do not stir.Remove from the heat and carefully spoon off any foam from the top. Carefully pour the clear liquid butter into a small container, leaving behind the solids in the pan.  Once cool, the clarified butter can be refrigerated for weeks.Preheat oven (with the rack positioned in the center of the oven) to 400°F.  Line a rimmed baking sheet with a Silpat. Cut off the two ends of a potato. Trim the 4 sides of the potato to form an even brick. Slice the potato about 1/8 inch thick on a mandoline. Stack the slices together like a deck of cards.  Tilt the stack over at an angle and lay on the prepared baking sheet.  Dot the top and sides with 1 tablespoon of the clarified butter. Sprinkle with salt to taste. Repeat with the remaining potatoes, keeping the stacks at least 2 inches apart. Bake for 40 minutes or until the potatoes are browned on the edges and tender in the middle when tested with a skewer. Serve immediately. At first I couldn't understand how Food52 got their potato dominoes to look so browned but then I realized they just flipped them over!These turned out exactly as promised:  crispy at the edges and yet somehow still creamy in the middle.  I loved that each slice was cooked through; I really hate the taste and texture of undercooked potato.  I'd love to try this with maybe a sprig of rosemary or thyme laid across the top of each stack or maybe even with duck fat instead of the butter.

Increase heat to moderate and boil mixture, without stirring, until a candy or digital thermometer registers 240°F, about 12 minutes. Remove pan from heat and pour sugar mixture over gelatin mixture, stirring until gelatin is dissolved. With standing mixer beat mixture on high speed until white, thick, and nearly tripled in volume, about six minutes. In separate medium bowl with cleaned beaters beat egg whites until they just hold stiff peaks. Beat whites into sugar mixture until just combined.  At this point, if you would like to color your marshmallows, you can add a few drops of yellow food coloring.  This also helps let you know when the egg whites have been fully combined in the mixture.  (I only added 1 drop, and you can barely tell in these pictures that the marshmallows aren't white.) Pour mixture into baking pan.  This is probably the trickiest part of the whole operation. Try to smooth out the marshmallow fluff as best you can.  I take it back; this is the trickiest part.  It's okay if you don't get it perfectly smooth because then it's super obvious that it's homemade! Sift 1/4 cup confectioners sugar evenly over top. Chill marshmallow, uncovered, until firm, at least three hours, and up to one day. Run a thin knife around edges of pan and invert pan onto a large cutting board. Lifting up one corner of inverted pan, with fingers loosen marshmallow and ease onto cutting board. With a large knife cut marshmallow into roughly one-inch cubes. Sift remaining confectioners’ sugar back into your now-empty baking pan, and working in batches, roll the marshmallows through it, on all six sides, before shaking off the excess and packing them away.Marshmallows keep in an airtight container at cool room temperature 1 week. These marshmallows were all that I hoped they would be:  soft and bouncy and tart and sweet.  They taste like pure sunshine to me.  If I had an experience with a Dementor, I'd eat one of these afterwards, and it would make me feel better than chocolate could.  ^_^Next:  Potato DominoesPreviously:  Vanilla Cinnamon MarshmallowsThree years ago:  Lemon Pudding Cake"},

This is where the recipe from Smitten Kitchen stops.  I tasted the marshmallows at this point, and they were perfect in texture--springy and fluffy just like she promised.  The taste was just a little too...one dimensional for me, though.  Vanilla in its other definition.  It was too late to add any wet ingredients like another flavor extract, but then I thought, what if I just toss it with some cinnamon?  Cinnamon and sugar are such a great flavor combination already (think cinnamon toast or snickerdoodles), it couldn't hurt to try.  So I plopped a few marshmallows in a gallon-sized Ziploc bag and sprinkled in a few dashes of ground cinnamon.  A few shakes later, the cinnamon was pretty evenly distributed. It came down to the taste test:  would it be enough?  Too strong?  It turned out perfect!  The cinnamon added just enough spicy heat to give the marshmallows some depth while still remaining light and airy.  Unfortunately I didn't measure out how much cinnamon I tossed in there; it was literally just a couple of shakes.  I'd say start off with a little, shake, and taste.  If you want, you can always add more, but it's pretty hard to remove the cinnamon if you add too much.Next:  Passion Fruit MarshmallowsPreviously:  Homemade Bagels Four years ago:  Toasted Coconut Ice Cream with Sesame Brittle and Crystallized Ginger"},
{"title": "Homemade Bagels", "date": "Thursday, January 31, 2013", "text": "So remember that time I decided to make croissants from scratch using what was probably the most complicated recipe ever?  And remember how it took almost three days to make?  Well this is pretty much the exact opposite of that.One morning I was craving a bagel with cream cheese, but it was too cold, and I was too lazy to go out to the store to buy some.  So I decided to look up some bagel recipes to see how easy it would be to make them at home.  Really easy, it turns out.  (Yes, you read that right:  I was too lazy to go to the store but not lazy enough to make my own bagels.  Go figure.)  In fact, you can almost whip these up in about 2 hours if you really wanted.  I'd suggest letting them rise slowly (overnight) in the refrigerator, though, for better flavor and texture (see note at the bottom of this post).I used this recipe from CHOW as a template and altered it based on some of the comments on the post and by the ingredients I had on hand.  First, I noticed a lot of the comments mentioning that 2 tablespoons of salt was way too much, so I used 2 teaspoons instead.  I also added some baking soda to the boiling water because someone mentioned it would give it a more authentic NYC taste, whatever that means.  And because I only had diastatic malt powder, I substituted the malt syrup with 1 teaspoon of the malt powder. I also decided to shape the bagels using the \"finger hula hooping\" method rather than the \"snake biting its tail\" method.  Yeah, I just made the name of those two methods up, but I'm sure you can see where I'm going with them.  The finger hula hooping method is just too fun not to do! Homemade Bagels (adapted from CHOW)makes 12 bagels1 1/2 cups tepid water (105-110°F), plus 1 tablespoon for the egg wash1 packet active dry yeast4 cups bread flour1 teaspoon diastatic malt powder 2 teaspoons kosher salt4 teaspoons sugarVegetable Oil 1 teaspoon baking soda1 large egg whiteSesame seeds, poppy seeds, or coarse salt for topping Place the tepid water in a small bowl and dissolve the yeast completely; set aside. Combine flour, malt powder, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Add yeast mixture, scraping any undissolved yeast out of the bowl with a spatula.Mix on low until most of the loose flour has been worked into the dough and the dough looks shredded, about 2 minutes. Increase the speed to medium low and continue mixing until the dough is stiff, smooth, and elastic, about 8 to 9 minutes more. (If the dough gets stuck on the hook or splits into 2 pieces, stop the machine, scrape off the hook, and mash the dough back into the bottom of the bowl.) The dough should be dry, not tacky or sticky, and somewhat stiff. Shape the dough into a ball, pour a glug of oil over it, and turn it to coat in oil. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let the dough rise in a warm place, until it is noticeably puffy and springs back when you poke it, about 20 minutes. (The dough will not double in size.) Meanwhile, heat the oven to 425°F and arrange the rack in the middle. Fill a large, wide, shallow pan (about 3 to 6 quarts) with water and baking soda, bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium low and let simmer. Cover until you’re ready to boil the bagels. Line a baking sheet with a Silpat or parchment paper greased with oil or cooking spray. Place a metal rack inside of a second baking sheet and set aside. Turn the risen dough out onto a dry surface. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces, about 3 ounces each.  (While you work, keep the dough you’re not handling covered with a damp towel to prevent drying.) Roll each piece into a ball, then poke a hole through the middle with your index finger.  With the dough still wrapped around your finger like a ring, rotate your hand upright and start twirling it around to enlarge the hole (you can also do this with your finger touching the work surface, but it's not as fun because there's no risk of the dough accidentally flying off your finger!). Widen the hole in the middle so it is approximately the size of a quarter. Cover the shaped bagels with a damp towel and let rest 10 minutes.* After resting, stretch the dough to retain the quarter-size hole (the dough will have risen a bit) and boil the bagels, making sure they have room to bob around.  Cook for about 60 seconds on each side until the bagels have a shriveled look, then remove to the baking sheet with the rack in it. Adjust heat as necessary so the water stays at a simmer. Whisk together the remaining 1 tablespoon of water and the egg white until evenly combined. Brush the egg wash all over the bagels, then sprinkle as desired with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, or coarse salt. Arrange the bagels on the lined baking sheet about 1 inch apart and bake. Rotate the pan after 15 minutes and bake until the bagels are a deep caramel color and have formed a crust on the bottom and top, about 10 minutes more. Remove from the oven and let cool on a rack for at least 30 minutes so the interiors finish cooking and the crusts form a chewy exterior. These bagels were exactly what I think of when I think bagel:  dense and chewy with a thick crust that has a \"snap\" to it.  As you can see in the pictures, they weren't kidding about making sure the hole in the middle was the size of a quarter before boiling and baking.These aren't delicate, little pastries.  They'll stand up to a good schmear and go great with the bacon scallion cream cheese from the Momofuku Milk Bar Bagel Bombs, but even with plain cream cheese they're wonderful.    *At this point I decided to freeze some of the bagels.  The night before I wanted to eat them, I would remove however many I wanted from the freezer and put them in the refrigerator to thaw overnight.  Then the next morning I would let them come to room temperature, widen the hole if needed, and proceed with the boiling step.  I found that the bagels I made this way had a deeper flavor and more textured crust (compare the bagel below with the bagel at the top of the post).Next:  Vanilla Cinnamon MarshmallowsPreviously:  Bagel BombsFour years ago:  Clementine Cupcakes"},

(If it just looks like a big wet mess, add some more flour until it begins to look more like a ball.)  Then knead for 4 more minutes on the lowest speed.  The dough should look like a wet ball and should bounce back softly when prodded. Brush a large bowl with oil and transfer the dough ball into it (um, yeah, I might have accidentally poured a little too much oil into the bowl as evidenced in the pictures). Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough proof at room temperature for 45 minutes.  Make the everything bagel mix by mixing together the salt, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, dried onions, onion powder, and garlic powder. Preheat the oven to 325°F.Punch down and flatten the dough on a smooth, dry counter top.  Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Put a cream cheese plug in the center of each piece of dough.   Bring up the edges of each round and pinch to seal so that the cream cheese plug is completely contained, then gently roll the ball between the palms of your hands to ensure the bomb has a nice, round, dinner roll-y shape. Arrange the bombs 4 inches apart on a parchment- or Silpat-lined cookie sheet. Whisk the egg and 1/2 teaspoon water together and brush a generous coat of egg wash on the buns. Sprinkle a heavy, even coating of the bagel mix all over the bagel bombs–every possible inch, except for the bottoms, should be coated. Bake the bagel bombs for 20 to 30 minutes.  While in the oven, the bombs will become a deep golden brown and a few may have cream cheese explosions.  Continue baking until you see this happen. As you can see in the picture above, the bottom right bun burst, so I pulled the baking sheet out, but I probably could have left the buns in there a little longer to get a little brown. I found that while the buns were really delicious, the dough didn't really remind me of a nice, chewy bagel.  If anything, it kind of reminded me of my mom's hua juan buns.  I went back to the Milk Bar recently and tried the Bagel Bomb there to compare it with the ones I made.  The one I had had probably sat in their display counter for a few hours so it wasn't really a fair comparison, but I really think my homemade ones were better! Next:  Homemade BagelsPreviously:  Rainbow Sandwich CookiesFour years ago:  Dutch Babies"},

(A food scale is helpful for this.) Add a few drops of red food coloring into one bag and squish around with your hands until the dough is evenly colored.  Add more food coloring to get it as bright as you like.  Repeat for the 5 other colors.  (I don't have any kids, but speaking as a kid at heart, this part was really fun.  So if you trust your kid, you might ask them to help you out with this part.  But I'd keep them away from any white carpeting, just in case.) Roll each colored dough into a long rope, about a centimeter wide.  The ropes will be very long, so it's easier to divide the dough into half first.  Make sure your hands are clean in between each color so that you don't muddy the colors. Stack the six different colored ropes together to form a pentagon with one of the ropes in the middle.  Lightly roll this tube around so that the ropes stick to each other.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Line two baking sheets with a Silpat or parchment paper and set aside.  If you only have one baking sheet, just bake the cookies in two batches. Slice the chilled cookie dough into about 1/8 inch thickness.  Space evenly on the baking sheet.  These cookies will spread a little, so give them at bit of space in between each one. Bake for about 10 minutes; do not allow to brown.  Allow to cool completely. To make the filling, beat the butter until smooth and creamy.  Add the sugar and vanilla extract and beat until smooth.  Add the milk and salt and beat until smooth again. Scoop into a pastry bag if you have one.  (I forgot to put the tip in before I filled my pastry bag so I didn't end up using one and just cut a small hole at the corner.) Match similarly shaped cookies together.  If you are using a pastry bag, pipe a layer of filling onto one cookie and top with its matching half, pressing down slightly to make it stick. If you have the time and inclination, move the pastry bag in and out of the center while moving around the cookie (like you're drawing flower) so that the outside edge of the filling makes a scalloped shape.  Otherwise, just pipe a spiral or if you're not using a pastry bag, use a spatula or butter knife to spread some of the filling onto the cookie. If I were to make these again, I think I'd actually use a lemon flavored icing instead of a vanilla flavored one to make them even more delicious!

{"title": "Traditional Croissants", "date": "Tuesday, January 15, 2013", "text": "At the end of last year, my company had their annual shut down between Christmas and New Years, and because of the way the two holidays fell this year, it turned into a blissful 11 day staycation.  It was my first time being at home for so long without working, so I decided to finally tackle my cooking \"Mount Everest\":  croissants.I remember looking at pictures of how croissant dough was made back in college and thinking, \"No.  Freaking.  Way.\"  First you make a pre-ferment sponge, called a poolish, the night before.  Then you use that to make a yeast dough, then wrap it around a slab of butter and then roll and fold it multiple times in between rounds of chilling, a method called laminating.  If you've gotten that far, you still have to shape it and allow it to rise before finally baking it off.  All in all, I would give it a good 2.5 days from start to finish.Since I was determined to make croissant dough, I decided to go with the expert and used Thomas Keller's recipe from the Bouchon Bakery cookbook.  There are probably simpler recipes out there, but I wanted the best.  For the European-style butter, I used Kerrygold Irish Butter, which they actually sell at Trader Joe's, and I was able to source the diastatic malt powder from King Arthur Flour. Traditional Croissants (adapted from Bouchon Bakery)makes 16 croissantsPoolish100 g all-purpose flour0.1 g instant yeast100 g water at 75°F330 g European-style unsalted butter Dough500 g all-purpose flour75 g sugar10 g instant yeast3 g diastatic malt powder200 g water at 75°F100 g unsalted butter, at room temperature15 g kosher saltEgg Wash1 egg, beaten and strained (I like to thin this out a little with 1 teaspoon of water) For the poolish:  Combine flour and yeast in a medium bowl.  Pour in water and mix.  Cover bowl loosely with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 12-15 hours. For the butter block:  Place butter on a piece of parchment paper.  Top with second piece of parchment paper and pound the butter from left to right with a rolling pin to begin to flatten it.  Turn the butter and parchment paper sandwich upside-down and rotate 90 degrees.Continue to flatten the butter until you have a 6 ¾ x 7 ½ inch rectangle.  Wrap tightly in the parchment paper and refrigerate.For the dough:  Spray a large bowl with nonstick spray.Combine the flour, sugar, yeast, and malt powder in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook and give it a quick mix on the lowest setting. Pour about half the water around the edges of the bowl of poolish to help release it and add to the mixer along with the rest of the water, reserving 50 g (3 ½ tablespoons).  Add the butter and mix on low for 2 minutes to moisten the dry ingredients.  Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure all the flour has been incorporated.Sprinkle the salt over the top and mix on low for 2 minutes to dissolve the salt.  If the mixture feels at all dry, add the reserved water in very small amounts as needed.  Continue to mix on low speed for 20 minutes.Run a bowl scraper around the sides and bottom of the bowl to release the dough and turn it out onto a work surface.  Stretch the left side of the dough outward and fold it over the center, then stretch and fold the right side over to the opposite side, as if you were folding a letter.  Repeat the process, working from the bottom and then the top.  Turn the dough over, lift it up with a bench scraper, and place it seam side down in the prepared bowl.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Line the quarter sheet pan with parchment paper.  Uncover the dough, run the bowl scraper around the sides and bottom of the bowl to release the dough, and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface, disturbing the structure as little as possible.  Gently but firmly pat the dough into a rectangle about 10 x 7 ½ inches, pressing any large gas bubbles to the edges and then out of the dough.  Transfer to the sheet pan, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for 20 minutes. To encase the butter and roll the dough:  Lightly flour the work surface and a heavy rolling pin.  Turn the dough out onto the work surface and lightly dust the top with flour.  Roll the dough outward from the center, rotating it frequently and flipping and fluffing it from time to time, adding just enough flour to the work surface, dough, and/or pin to prevent sticking, until you have a 16 x 7 ½ x ½ inch thick rectangle. Lay the block of butter across the center of the dough.  Stretch and fold over the two longer sides so they meet in the center and pinch together to seal.  There should be no exposed butter at the top of the block, but you will see the butter on the sides. For turn 1:  Using the rolling pin, press down firmly on the dough across the seam from one side to the other to expand the dough.  Turn the dough so a short end faces you.  Roll to expand the length of the dough, flipping, fluffing, and turning the dough over and adding flour only as needed, until you have a rectangle ~22 x 9 inches and 3/8 inch thick. Fold the bottom third of the dough up as if you were folding a letter.  Fold the top third down to cover the bottom third.  Turn the block 90 degrees so the dough resembles a book, with the opening on the right.  You will continue this pattern with each roll, and keeping the opening on the right will help you remember how to position the dough.  You have completed your first turn; gently press a finger into a corner to mark it.  Return to the sheet pan, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for 20 minutes or until the dough has stiffened but is not hard. For turn 2:  Lightly dust the work surface with flour.  Place the dough on the work surface with the opening on the right.  It is important to work with the dough as quickly as possible, but not at the risk of exposing the butter.  Pressing on the dough will warm the butter; if it is too cold, it will shatter rather than spread as you roll it.  Expand the dough by pressing down firmly with the rolling pin, working up the length of the dough.  If the dough cracks at all along the edges, stop and let it warm slightly at room temperature.  Then roll out the dough as you did before to a 22 x 9 x 3/8 inch thick rectangle and repeat the folding.  Turn the block 90 degrees, so the opening is on the right.  Gently press 2 fingers into a corner to mark the dough.  Return to the sheet pan, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for 20 minutes or until the dough has stiffened but is not hard. For turn 3:  Repeat all of the steps for turn 2 and mark the dough with 3 fingerprints.To finish the dough:  Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and lightly dust the work surface with flour.  Place the dough on the work surface with the opening on the right.It is especially critical at this stage that the dough remain cold; freeze as needed.  Lightly dust the top of the dough and roll it outward from the center, flipping, fluffing, and rotating the dough and turning it over, adding only enough flour to the work surface, dough, and/or pin as necessary to prevent sticking.  Roll the dough out to 24 x 9 inches. Cut the dough crosswise in half, making two 12 x 9 inch rectangles.  Stack on the sheet pan with a piece of parchment paper between them, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for 20 minutes, or until the dough has stiffened but is not hard.*Spray two sheet pans with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper (or just use 1 sheet pan if only using half the batch of dough).Lightly flour the work surface.  Remove one piece of dough from the freezer and position it on the work surface with the short end towards you; transfer the second piece of dough (if using at this time) to the refrigerator.  Roll the dough out to a rectangle 19 x 9 inches.Turn the dough so that a long side is facing you and trim it to 18 inches long.  Trim the remaining sides only as needed for straight edges. Cut the dough in half, crosswise, so that you have two squares, about 9 x 9 inches wide.  Then cut each squash in half so that you end up with four rectangles.  Cut each rectangle diagonally so that you end up with 8 right triangles. Hold one triangle up by the base with one hand and, using your fingertips, gently pull the dough until it is stretched to about 12 inches.Put the dough on the work surface, with the base of the triangle close to you.  Fold over the corners to the center of the base and roll the dough up from the wide end to the tip.  Put on a prepared sheet with the tail tucked under.  Press down slightly, flattening the croissant just enough so that it will not roll on the pan.  Repeat with the remaining 7 triangles of dough, spacing them evenly on the sheet pan.Remove the second piece of dough from the refrigerator, and, if necessary, let sit at room temperature until warmed enough to roll, then repeat to make 8 more croissants.  Brush the croissants with the egg wash.  Cover the pans with plastic tubs or cardboard boxes and let proof for about 2 hours.  Position the racks in the upper and lower two-thirds of the oven.  Preheat to 350°F.Brush the croissants again with egg wash.  Bake for 35-40 minutes, rotating the pans once halfway through baking and separating the croissants if they are touching, until the tops are a rich golden brown and no portions, particularly between the layers, look undercooked.  Set the pans on a rack and cool completely.The croissants are best the day they are baked.  Thomas Keller suggests freezing the baked croissants in several layers of plastic wrap if you have any leftover, but I actually prefer to freeze the croissants after they have been shaped and before they have proofed.  Then, the night before you want to eat the croissants, you can move them to the refrigerator to thaw and rise slowly.  The next morning, let them come to room temperature, brush with egg wash, and then bake according to the directions above.  Or let them thaw and rise at room temperature if you only have a few hours.As you can see in the picture above, I only baked 4 of the croissants in the first batch and didn't do a great job of shaping them (he wasn't kidding about the need to tuck the tail of the croissant underneath).  They still shattered nicely when I took a bite but were a little bland in taste.  My friend, Tammy, encouraged me by reminding me that more flavor would develop in dough that was sitting in the freezer, and she was right! The next day I thawed out and baked another batch of croissants, and they definitely had a deeper flavor.  As an added bonus, they also rose a lot more.  So I would definitely encourage you to let the dough sit in the refrigerator overnight (or in the freezer if you're not baking them the next day) if you have the time, hence the 2.5 days needed to make a batch of croissants.*I actually saved one of the two laminated sheets in the freezer to make pains au chocolat (chocolate croissants).  If you have leftover baked croissants, you can use those to make almond croissants the next day!  And for the really ambitious, you can also make cronuts out of this dough.Next:  Almond CroissantsPreviously:  Spicy Tuna with Crispy Sushi RiceThree years ago:  Banana Bread Yeasted WafflesFour years ago:  Nian Gao (Mochi Cake), Red Bean Ice Cream"},

{"title": "Tartine's Lemon Cream Tart", "date": "Friday, January 4, 2013", "text": "I had enough pine nut crust dough from making Thomas Keller's lemon tart to make one more tart, so I figured I would make one more lemon tart for comparison.  Tartine's lemon cream recipe had caught my eye a while back so I decided to try that as the filling.  Comparing the three recipes, this one has almost the same ratio of ingredients as Keller's except it has twice the amount of butter.  And it's a little easier than Keller's because it uses Lazy Mary's method of using a blender to incorporate the butter instead of doing it over a steaming hot pot of water.Lemon Cream Tart (from Tartine)makes 1 tart1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons lemon juice (Meyer or regular, I used regular)3 large eggs1 large egg yolk3/4 cup sugarPinch of salt1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter1 pre-baked tart shell at room temperature (I used Thomas Keller's pine nut crust) Pour water to a depth of about 2 inches into a saucepan, place over medium heat, and bring to a simmer.Combine the lemon juice, whole eggs, yolk, sugar, and salt in a stainless steel bowl that will rest securely in the rim of a saucepan over, not touching, the water. (Never let the egg yolks and sugar sit together for more than a moment without stirring; the sugar will cook the yolks and turn them granular.) Place the bowl over the saucepan and continue to whisk until the mixture becomes very thick and registers 180° F on a thermometer. This will take 10 to 12 minutes. If you don't have or trust your thermometer, don't worry. It should thicken to the point that your whisk leaves a trail through the curd.Remove the bowl from over the water and let cool to 140° F, stirring from time to time to release the heat.Meanwhile, cut butter into 1-tablespoon pieces. When the cream is ready, leave it in the bowl if using an immersion blender, or pour it into a countertop blender. With the blender running, add the butter 1 tablespoon at a time, blending after each addition until incorporated before adding the next piece. The cream will be pale yellow and opaque and quite thick. Pour the cream into your pre-baked tart shell and cover with plastic wrap.  Cool to room temperature and then place in the refrigerator to chill for several hours. Out of the three, this was definitely my favorite lemon tart.  The lemon cream was a perfect balance of sweet and sour, of acidity and creaminess.  I was afraid that it wouldn't set enough to cut into slices, but after a few hours in the fridge, it was actually firm enough to cut. I was lucky enough to go to Tartine recently for my birthday and try an authentic Tartine lemon cream tart.  They didn't use a pine nut crust, but other than that, I'd say that it tasted pretty much exactly the same as the one this recipe makes!

{"title": "Lazy Mary's Lemon Tart", "date": "Wednesday, January 2, 2013", "text": "Compared to Thomas Keller's lemon tart, this lemon tart recipe that I found on Food 52 is incredibly simple.  In fact, the hardest part might be finding a Meyer lemon.  I had never bought one before, so I was expecting a larger than normal lemon, especially since the recipe only calls for one Meyer lemon, but they turned out to be smaller than the lemons I was used to.  And the fragrance--do all Meyer lemon rinds smell like jasmine?  Because if they do, I might have to seriously consider moving to California just so I can have my own Meyer lemon tree.One big difference you'll notice about this recipe is that the entire lemon (seeds, too, although I chickened out and tossed at least half the seeds) goes into the filling.  Meyer lemons have a thinner skin than normal lemons, and it's common to see the whole Meyer lemon being used in recipes like Shaker pies.  I wouldn't recommend using a regular lemon for this recipe; I've eaten lemon bars made with whole lemons before and the pith made them way too bitter. Lazy Mary's Lemon Tart (from Food 52)makes 1 tart1 large Meyer lemon (about 4 oz.) cut into 8 pieces1 1/2 cup superfine sugar1 stick butter1 teaspoon vanilla4 eggsYour favorite tart shell, pre-baked (I used Thomas Keller's pine nut crust) Put all ingredients (except tart shell) into a blender and whirl like crazy! Pour into tart shell. Bake 40 minutes at 350°F (watch that the top does not burn). This tart tasted a lot more like a lemon bar to me than what I think of when I think of a lemon tart.  I wasn't crazy about how it looked either; it probably would benefit from a dusting of powdered sugar on top like lemon bars do.  It was really quick and easy to make, though, so I'd recommend it if you're short on time, but the next (and last) lemon tart that I made is really my ideal lemon tart, and it's easier to make than Keller's!Next:  Tartine's Lemon Cream TartPreviously:  Thomas Keller's Lemon TartThree years ago:  Creamy Delicata Squash SoupFour years ago:  Hua Juan (Steamed Scallion Buns)"},
{"title": "Thomas Keller's Lemon Tart", "date": "Monday, December 31, 2012", "text": "After years and years of not owning a tart pan, I finally bought one, and the first thing I wanted to do was make Thomas Keller's lemon tart.  My friend, Ellen, had made one with her family and they had raved about how good the pine nut crust was, so I knew I needed to try it.The pine nut crust recipe makes enough for 3 tarts but is hard to divide since it only uses one egg.  Go ahead and make the full recipe and keep the leftover dough in the fridge where it will keep for a couple of days or the freezer, where it will keep for a month, because after you taste it, you'll just want to make more.Pine Nut Crust (from Bouchon)makes enough for 3 tart crusts2 cups pine nuts1/3 cup sugar3 cups all-purpose flour8 ounces unsalted butter, at room temperature1 large egg1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Place the pine nuts in a food processor and pulse a few times.  Add the sugar and flour and continue to pulse until the nuts are finely ground.  Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add the butter, egg, and vanilla extract and mix to incorporate all the ingredients (the dough can be mixed by hand or in a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment).  Divide the dough into three equal parts.  Wrap each piece in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes before using. Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Generously butter and flour a 9-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom and refrigerate it while the oven preheats. Remove the tart pan from the refrigerator.  Use your fingertips to press the chilled pine nut dough evenly over the bottom and up the sides of the pan.  I found that the easiest way to do this was to fill in the sides of the pan first, and then press down whatever dough is left into the bottom.  That way you don't have to worry about making sure there is enough dough to evenly press into the sides if you started in the middle. Prick the tart crust with a fork to prevent it from puffing up unevenly.  Bake the crust for 10 to 15 minutes, then rotate it and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until it is golden brown.  Remove the crust from the oven and let it cool while you make the filling.The filling for this lemon tart is made using the sabayon method, which means the eggs, lemon juice, and sugar are first cooked over boiling water and then incorporated with the butter.Lemon Tart (from Bouchon)makes 1 tart1 pre-baked Pine Nut Crust 2 large eggs, cold2 large egg yolks, cold3/4 cup sugar1/2 cup fresh lemon juice6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 6 piecesBring about 1 1/2 inches of water to a boil in a medium pot.  Meanwhile, in a large metal bowl, whisk the eggs, yolks, and sugar for about 1 minute, or until the mixture is smooth. Set the bowl over the pot and, using a large whisk, whip the mixture while you turn the bowl (for even heating).  After about 2 minutes, when the eggs are foamy and have thickened, add one-third of the lemon juice.  Continue to whisk vigorously and, when the mixture thickens again, add another one-third of the lemon juice.  Whisk until the mixture thickens again, then add the remaining lemon juice.  Continue whisking vigorously, still turning the bowl, until the mixture is thickened and light in color and the whisk leaves a trail in the bottom of the bowl.  The total cooking time should be 8 to 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave the bowl over the water.  Whisk in the butter a piece at a time.  The sabayon may loosen slightly, but it will thicken and set as it cools.  Pour the warm sabayon into the tart crust and place the pan on a baking sheet. Preheat the broiler.  While the sabayon is still warm, place the tart under the broiler.  Leaving the door open, brown the top of the sabayon, rotating the tart if necessary for even color; this will take only a few seconds, so do not leave the oven.  Remove the tart from the broiler and let it sit for at least 1 hour before serving. Serve at room temperature or cold. As you can see from the picture above, I didn't do a great job with broiling the top evenly.  It would've been a lot easier with one of those mini blowtorches that you use for creme brulee, I think. As with all Thomas Keller recipes, this is not simple to make, but delicious to eat.  Since I still had enough crust for 2 more tarts, I decided to try a super easy lemon tart recipe next.Next:  Lazy Mary's Lemon TartPreviously:  Vegetable Tempura and Tempura UdonThree years ago:  Homemade Waffle Face OffFour years ago:  Hot Pot, Tang Yuan"},

{"title": "Homemade Udon Noodles", "date": "Wednesday, December 19, 2012", "text": "Compared to making ramen noodles, making udon noodles seems a lot less fussy.  There's no obscure ingredient to find (unless you live somewhere where you can't find tapioca flour) and you literally use your feet to knead the dough.  I know!  Since the noodles are a thicker cut, there's even less of a need to have a pasta machine as well, although I found the dough to be stiffer so a pasta machine can really help with the rolling part.Udon Noodles (adapted from She Simmers)makes 1 1/2 lbs. fresh noodles5 1/2 cups bread flour plus more for dusting1/2 cup tapioca flour3 teaspoons kosher salt1 1/4 cups warm waterMix together the bread flour and tapioca flour in a large mixing bowl. Dissolve the salt in the warm water.  Pour about half of the salt water into the flour and mix with your hands.  Add the remaining water, a teaspoon at a time, just until you can form a ball with the dough. Place the dough in a gallon size Ziploc bag, squeeze out the air, and seal.  Place the bag on the ground and knead with your feet for a minute.  (I may or may not have put on my cutest socks for that shot.)Remove the dough from the bag, fold it in thirds like a letter, place it back in the bag, and knead with your feet again for another minute.  Repeat this process two more times. Let the dough rest in a warm place for 3-6 hours.Divide the dough in 4 quarters.  Work on a quarter at a time, leaving the rest of the dough covered. Use a pasta machine or roll out the dough on a floured surface to 1/8\" thickness.   Dust the surface of the dough with a little more flour and then fold it into thirds like a letter.  Cut the dough into 1/8\" thick strips.   Keep the noodles covered while you work on rolling out and cutting the rest of the dough.  At this point you can store the fresh, uncooked noodles in an airtight container (I used a Ziploc bag) in the refrigerator for a few days before cooking.  Just make sure to toss them in enough flour to keep them from sticking to one another.  As you can kind of see from my pictures, my dough was so dry already that I didn't need to add much more flour.  Bring a large pot of water to boil and add the fresh noodles.  After about 3 minutes, the noodles will start to float.  Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the noodles look swollen.  Drain and rinse with cold water.  Above is a comparison of hand-rolled and hand-cut noodles vs. machine rolled and cut noodles.  Can you tell which is which? I like to eat my udon noodles in a dashi broth seasoned with a little soy sauce and mirin (about 2 teaspoons of soy sauce and 1 teaspoon of mirin per cup of dashi).  Add whatever toppings you want:  tofu, mushrooms, snow peas, carrots, etc.  My favorite is vegetable tempura, which I'll cover in the next post!Next:  Vegetable Tempura and Tempura UdonPreviously:  Momofuku Ramen BrothThree years ago:  Apple and Pear Cake FailFour years ago:  Macarons - A Lesson in Humility"},
{"title": "Momofuku Ramen Broth", "date": "Friday, December 14, 2012", "text": "After I made the miso ramen, I decided to try to make a bacon version.  I fried up some bacon, added bacon grease to the broth, and even added some smoked salt, but I just couldn't get the depth of flavor that I was looking for.  So I decided to try making Momofuku's ramen broth.  After all, it used bacon as one of the ingredients so it must be on the right track. What I love about this recipe is that it builds layers and layers of umami using multiple ingredients:  kombu, shiitake mushrooms, chicken bones, roast pork bones, and finally tare, a soy based barbecue sauce made with roast chicken bones.  By the end, you get a super rich and flavorful broth that surprisingly isn't very heavy at all.The first step is to make the tare.  This recipe will make more than you need, but you can also use it to season just about anything you'd normally use soy sauce for.  I've added it to the filling for dumplings, and it would be excellent as a basting sauce for grilled meats.Tare (adapted from Momofuku)makes 1 cup2 chicken legs 1 cup soy sauce1/2 cup rice wine1/2 cup mirin Preheat the oven to 450°F.  Using a butcher knife, butcher the chicken legs into the thigh piece and drumstick. Place the thighs and drumsticks onto an oven-proof pan and roast for about 45 minutes, or until nicely browned, but not burnt.  Remove the pan from the oven and place on medium high on the stove.  Add a splash of the soy sauce, and once it starts boiling, scrape up all the caramelized fond from the bottom of the pan with a spatula. Add the rest of the ingredients and once it starts boiling, reduce the heat, and let it simmer for about an hour.  Strain out the chicken and store the tare in a jar.  It'll keep for a few days in the fridge or longer in the freezer.  I like to keep a little of the fat on top to help seal off the top and preserve the sauce better.Now it's time to make the broth.  I halved the recipe from the book because I was short on some of the ingredients, but I would suggest making the full amount since it's the same amount of work, and the broth freezes well.  I've also found that when refrigerated, the broth will form an aspic, so you can also use it to make xiao long bao.Momofuku Ramen Broth (from Momofuku)makes 5 pints, about 5 servings3 three-inch pieces of kombu1 cup dried shiitake mushrooms2.5 lbs. pork neck bones 2 chicken legs1/2 lb. bacon6 scallions 1/2 onion1 large carrot, chopped into large piecesTare (see recipe above)Preheat the oven to 400°F. Add the kombu to 3 quarts of water in a large pot.  Turn the heat on high, and just before it boils, turn off the heat and let sit for 10 minutes. Remove the kombu with a slotted spoon and add the dried shiitake mushrooms.  Bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat and let simmer for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place the pork neck bones on a baking tray and roast in the oven for 60 minutes, flipping half way through. Remove the mushrooms from the broth with a slotted spoon and add the chicken legs.  Continue to simmer for an hour, skimming off any of the crud that floats to the top. After an hour, check the chicken to make sure that it is cooked through and the meat is falling off the bones.  At that point, remove from the broth and add the bacon and pork bones.  Continue to simmer, adding more water if necessary. After 45 minutes, remove the bacon.  Continue to simmer for 5-8 hours.  About 45 minutes before you are done, add the scallions, onion, and carrot pieces.  After simmering for 45 minutes, strain everything out.If you are using your broth right away, add 1/4 cup of the tare and taste your broth.  David Chang recommends seasoning it until it is almost at but just under \"too salty\". If not using your broth immediately, you can turn the heat on high and reduce the volume in half.  Store in the refrigerator (if using within a few days) or the freezer.  When ready to use, heat it up again and add an equal volume of water.  Season with the tare to taste. For my bacon ramen, I topped the Momofuku ramen broth and homemade ramen noodles with some fried bacon, blanched spinach, corn kernels, chopped scallion, a soft-boiled egg, and nori.  I still felt like it was missing a little something, so I added some fried shallots, which turned out to be the perfect touch.Next:  Homemade Udon NoodlesPreviously:  Miso Ramen with Marinated Soft-Boiled EggFour years ago:  Pork and Cabbage Dumplings"},
{"title": "Miso Ramen with Marinated Soft-Boiled Egg", "date": "Tuesday, December 11, 2012", "text": "Now that we've made the ramen noodles, it's time to make some ramen broth!  Some broths take hours if not days to make, but fortunately, it only takes a few minutes to make the broth for miso ramen.  There's two ways you can make this broth:  either add instant dashi and miso paste to chicken broth, or add chicken bouillon and miso paste to dashi stock.  I chose to do the latter because dashi is a lot easier to make than chicken broth, and the two ingredients (kombu and bonito flakes) are shelf stable. Kombu is a type of seaweed, and bonito flakes are made from smoked, shaved fish.  You should be able to find both in an Asian grocery store, but I've also found them in the ethnic section of grocery stores. They both are very high in umami, which is why such a simple preparation can produce so much flavor.Dashi Stock makes 1 quart, enough for 2 bowls of miso ramen4 cups water2-3 strips of kombu1/2 cup loosely packed bonito flakes Place the water and kombu in a medium pot and let soak for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, place the pot on medium heat.  Just before it boils, remove from heat and sprinkle the bonito flakes over the surface of the water. After 3-4 minutes, strain through a fine mesh strainer. Now let's talk toppings:  my absolute favorite is a marinated soft-boiled egg.  It's similar to lu dan, except the yolk is barely set, and the marinade only penetrates the outer surface of the egg.  It took me a few tries to get it right because the recipe I was using called for the egg to be boiled for only 6 minutes, but my eggs were still too soft at that point.  You want to cook it just long enough so that the egg white is set.  If it's too soft, it's almost impossible to peel, which I found out the hard way.  Eventually, through trial and error, I found that 7 and a half minutes was the ideal amount of time that I needed to cook my eggs to that point. Marinated Soft-Boiled Eggs (adapted from Serious Eats)makes 3 eggs (you only need 2 for 2 bowls of ramen, but you might as well make the third since there's enough marinade for 3 eggs)1/2 cup water1/2 cup rice wine1/4 cup soy sauce1/4 cup mirin1/4 cup sugar3 eggsCombine water, rice wine, soy, mirin, and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk until sugar is dissolved. Set aside.Bring 1 quart of water to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat.  Carefully lower eggs into water with a slotted spoon. Reduce heat to maintain a bare simmer. Cook for exactly 7 minutes and 30 seconds. Drain hot water and transfer eggs to a bowl filled with ice water.  Cool for 3 minutes and then carefully peel eggs (the whites will be quite delicate). Transfer eggs to a bowl that just barely fits them all. Pour marinade on top until eggs are covered or just floating. Place a double-layer of paper towels on top and press down until completely saturated in liquid to help keep eggs submerged and marinating evenly. Cover and refrigerate at least four hours and up to 12. Discard marinade after 12 hours. Store eggs in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 3 days. As for the rest of the toppings, I didn't have any roast pork on hand, or else I would have used that, but I did have some fried tofu, which worked well with the miso broth.  Other possible toppings include corn, bean sprouts, chopped scallions, nori, cooked spinach, bamboo shoots, etc.  You don't want anything too strong to mask the flavor of the broth, but it's nice to have a few different textures in each bite.Miso Ramenmakes 2 bowls4 cups dashi stock1 chicken bouillon cube3 tablespoons frozen corn kernels1/4 cup fresh bean sprouts8 pieces fried tofu 2 tablespoons white miso paste1/2 recipe ramen noodles, cooked2 marinated soft-boiled eggs, sliced in half lengthwise4 four inch-square sheets nori2 teaspoons scallions, chopped Add the dashi stock, bouillon cube, corn, bean sprouts, and fried tofu in a medium pot and bring to a boil over high heat.  Remove the corn, bean sprouts, and tofu with a slotted spoon and set aside. Remove the pot from heat and add the miso paste to the stock.  Stir to dissolve. Split the cooked ramen noodles between two large bowls.  Pour in the miso broth. Top each bowl with half the corn, bean sprouts, fried tofu, and marinated soft-boiled eggs.Place two sheets of nori in each bowl and sprinkle half the scallions over each bowl.Next post:  Momofuku Ramen Broth!Previously:  Homemade Ramen NoodlesFour years ago:  Pan-Fried Pasta with Butternut Squash, Fried Sage, and Pine Nuts"},
{"title": "Homemade Ramen Noodles", "date": "Friday, December 7, 2012", "text": "For most of my life, ramen meant the instant kind, and I loved it.  Then, my friend introduced me to real Japanese ramen, and I was in love.  The first time I had it was at Ken's Ramen House, which sadly, has now closed.  He made real tonkatsu ramen broth and imported the ramen noodles, and according to my friend, it was pretty authentic.  There are a couple of other places to get ramen in the Boston area but none of them are as good as Ken's was.  Maybe it's kind of a first love thing.  Another ramen shop opened this past year in Porter, and there are still hour plus long lines to eat there.  I finally went the other week, and it was good, but I'm not sure I'd wait another hour in the cold for it again.  Because now I can make my own ramen! I found this recipe for making ramen noodles a couple of years ago but never went through the trouble of finding the kansui because I figured it'd be too hard to find.  A Japanese grocery story opened up in Porter this year so I decided to stop in one day and see if they had it.  They did, but only in this huge bottle.  I guess I'll be making a lot of homemade ramen. The kansui is a solution of potassium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate that reacts with the flour to make it yellow in color and also toughens the protein so that the noodles are springier than regular wheat noodles.  I noticed that my dough started turning more greyish green after a while, and found on another website that it was because the dough was too alkaline.  Adding a little bit of citric acid would neutralize the pH and should return it back to yellow (or you could just use a little less kansui).  Of course, I didn't read this until it was too late and just used the grey noodles as is.  They seemed to look more yellow than green after cooking, and they tasted great, so I wouldn't worry to much if this happens to your noodles too. The first time I made this, I didn't have a pasta machine, so I just rolled it out and cut it by hand.  So it's possible.  But it's more fun using a pasta machine, and you'll get these amazingly thin and evenly cut noodles. Homemade Ramen Noodles (from No Recipes)makes enough for 4 bowls300 grams bread flour (about 2 cups)1/2 cup warm water1 teaspoon Koon Chun Potassium Carbonate & Sodium Bi-Carbonate (kansui)Put the flour in the bowl of a mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix the water and kansui together, then add the mixture to the flour. The flour should immediately start turning yellow.  Give the mixture a quick stir with the dough hook to combine everything then attach the bowl to your mixer and run on medium high speed for 10 minutes. It’s a dry dough so it will look like a bunch of gravel at this point. Use your hands to divide it in two and press together into two balls. Flatten each ball out on a flat surface, and run it through the largest setting of your pasta roller a few times, folding it in half each time. The dough will be ragged the first few runs though but will smooth out. When it starts rolling out smoother, fold it up into a square and wrap with plastic wrap and store it in the fridge overnight. When you’re ready to cook it, prepare a large pot of boiling salted water. Each ball will make enough for 2 bowls of ramen, so figure out how much you need. Flour the dough generously and roll it out to the 3 setting on your pasta roller. Cut the dough in half so you have two sheets of dough a little over 1 foot long and flour generously again. Use the spaghetti attachment to cut the pasta into long thin noodles, dusting them with flour as they are cut to keep them from sticking together.  (I actually found that the noodles were not very sticky and didn't need to dust them at all.) Boil the noodles until they are slightly firmer than the final consistency you want, since they will continue cooking after you remove them from the water. If you're not ready to boil all the noodles yet, you can save them in an air-tight container (I used a plastic baggie) for a day or two in the fridge.I still haven't figured out how to make the noodles curly, though.  Any suggestions?  Next:  Miso Ramen with Marinated Soft-Boiled EggsPreviously:  Vanilla Passion CaramelsThree years ago:  Tim Tam Slam Ice CreamFour years ago:  Beef Noodle (Soup) and Lu Dan"},
{"title": "Vanilla Passion Caramels", "date": "Monday, December 3, 2012", "text": "When I went to Paris for the first time this past summer, one of my friends gave me a list of food recommendations, and one of the most highlighted items were the mango passion caramels from Jacques Genin.  So Ellen and I made sure to make it one of our first stops in the city, and omg, was it so worth it.  You already know about my obsession with the passion fruit ice cream, and this caramel was basically the best caramel ever infused with the purified sunshine of passion fruit and mangoes.I've been hoping to try to recreate this treat but all my web searches only turned up really complicated recipes that needed some weird ingredients or recipes for making passion fruit caramel sauce.  I wasn't confident enough to try adapting a regular butter caramel recipe since the only other time I had made caramels were the bacon fat caramels, but then I saw Smitten Kitchen's apple cider caramels post.  First I made the apple cider caramels according to her recipe to get familiar with the process and figure out how soft the caramels were.  They turned out exactly as she had promised--a burst of apple cider and buttery goodness--except that I ended up with a mouthful of cinnamony sharp salt at the end.  I'm guessing it's because I used Maldon salt (as recommended in the recipe), which has pretty large salt crystals, and you don't add it until the very end along with the cinnamon so there isn't a lot of time for the salt to dissolve.I adapted the recipe by switching in passion fruit puree for the apple cider and using kosher salt in the beginning instead of the end.  I also decided to throw in vanilla bean to partially temper the tartness of the passion fruit and also add a little crackle from the seeds.I'm super impressed with the results:  not only does it taste super delicious, it's also pretty easy to make, for caramels.  I love that everything is cooked together instead of caramelizing the sugar first and then adding in the butter and cream.  The latter process can get a little scary when the caramel explodes in volume, especially if you underestimated the size of the pot you're using.  I would recommend using a candy or instant read thermometer because you want to make sure the mixture cooks to 252°F, right in between the firm ball and hard ball stage.  If you don't cook it long enough, the caramel will be too soft, but if you cook it too far, it will be too hard.  I've taken pictures of what the caramel looks like every 10 degrees above 220°F to give you an idea of what it looks like, and you could, of course, just drop a bit into cold water to figure out which stage the sugar is at, but a thermometer is really just the easiest way to figure it out. Vanilla Passion Caramelsmakes 60 pieces1/2 vanilla bean1/3 cup heavy cream1/2 cup unsalted butter1/2 cup passion fruit pulp (the easiest to find is the frozen Goya brand, sometimes with the frozen fruits, sometimes with the frozen ethnic foods)1 teaspoon kosher salt1 cup white sugar or vanilla sugar1/2 cup light brown sugar, packedNeutral oil (like grape seed or canola) for the knifeLine the bottom and sides of an 8- inch straight- sided square metal baking pan with 2 long sheets of crisscrossed parchment. Set it aside.  Make a lengthwise slit down the side of the vanilla bean and open it up.  Scrape out the seeds and add it to a small saucepan along with the cream and butter.  (Tip:  Instead of throwing away the vanilla bean, store it in your sugar to make vanilla sugar!) Heat on medium just until the butter is melted and turn off the flame.  Gently stir to break up the vanilla seed clusters.  Let steep for 10-15 minutes.Meanwhile, boil the passion fruit pulp in a 3- to- 4- quart saucepan over high heat until it is reduced in volume by half. Stir occasionally, making sure that it doesn't burn. Once you are finished reducing the passion fruit pulp, remove it from the heat and stir in the salt, sugars, and vanilla cream mixture. Return the pot to medium heat with a candy thermometer attached to the side, and let it boil until the thermometer reads 252°F. Immediately remove caramel from heat and pour caramel into the prepared pan. Let it sit until cool and firm—about 2 hours, though it goes faster in the fridge. Once caramel is firm, use your parchment paper sling to transfer the block to a cutting board. Use a well-oiled knife, oiling it after each cut, to cut the caramel into batons about 2\" long and 3/8\" wide. Wrap each one in waxed paper, twisting the sides to close.I keep the caramels in an air-tight container in the refrigerator and let them warm to room temperature before eating.  They will also last a couple of weeks at room temperature.  These are so good, I can barely bear to share them, but if so inclined, they would make great Christmas gifts!Three years ago:  Stuffed Delicata SquashFour years ago:  Salted Butter Caramel Ice Cream"},
{"title": "Three Bean Chili", "date": "Wednesday, November 28, 2012", "text": "Here's another healthy recipe full of fiber that will make you feel better after eating it.  It's even vegan (if you don't add cheese or sour cream), but I always feel full after eating it.  I used to make this at church along with polenta for hundreds of people, and no one ever complained for the lack of meat (although more than a few didn't eat the polenta because they didn't know what it was).I've taken the recipe from PETA and added three secret ingredients, adobo seasoning, liquid smoke, and chipotle peppers in adobo, to give it some real depth of flavor.  Well, I guess the ingredients aren't that secret anymore.  =)  Start with just a little bit of peppers, taste, and then add more because a little goes a long way. The recipe is pretty forgiving.  I've had to substitute crushed tomatoes and whole tomatoes for the diced tomatoes before.  Once I even used salsa instead of some of the tomatoes, and it still turned out okay.  I've made this with dried beans before, but it's a lot easier to make it with canned beans.  The original recipe calls for 2 parts kidney beans to 1 part pinto beans, but I substitute a can of black beans in for half the kidney beans to give it more color.Three Bean Chili (adapted from PETA)serves 62 tablespoons canola oil6 garlic cloves, minced1 cup chopped white onionRed pepper flakes, to taste1 tablespoon chili powder2 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin1 tablespoon adobo seasoning1 teaspoon oregano1 bay leaf28-oz. can diced fire-roasted tomatoes1 tablespoon soy sauce1 1/2 cups vegetable stock6 oz. tomato paste1 tablespoon red wine vinegar 16 oz. can pinto beans, drained16 oz. can kidney beans, drained16 oz. can black beans, drained1 teaspoon liquid smokeChipotle peppers in adobo, chopped, to taste Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat.  Add the garlic and onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes, chili powder, and cumin and cook for an additional 2 minutes, or until fragrant. Add the adobo seasoning, oregano, bay leaf, tomatoes, soy sauce, stock, tomato paste, and vinegar, then bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the beans and simmer 15 minutes longer to heat through and blend flavors.  Add more water, if necessary, or cook longer to reach desired consistency.  Add the liquid smoke and chopped chipotle peppers and stir to combine.  You can serve this with shredded cheese, sour cream, avocado slices, and chopped green onions.  I like to eat this with Fritos, brown rice and lime-flavored tortilla chips, or fried polenta. You can find tubes of pre-cooked polenta at Trader Joe's and just slice and pan fry it.  The chili freezes well, so go ahead and make a big pot!Three years ago:  Kettle Corn"},

Add the milk powder, sugar and salt, and toss to mix. Add the butter and toss to coat. As you toss, the butter will act as glue, binding the dry ingredients to the cracker pieces and creating small clusters. Preheat oven to 275°F. Press the Ritz crunch into a 10″ pie plate. Using your fingers and the palms of your hands, press the crunch in firmly, making sure to cover the bottom and sides evenly and completely. Put the tin on a sheet pan and bake for 20 minutes. Cool the crust completely.Grapefruit Passion Curd1/4 cup passion fruit puree3 tablespoons sugar1 large egg1/4 teaspoon powdered gelatin6 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled1/4 teaspoon kosher salt1 large grapefruit1 teaspoon canola oil Put the passion fruit puree and sugar into a blender and blend until the sugar has dissolved. Add the egg and blend on low until the mixture is smooth and bright orange-yellow. Pour the mixture into a medium saucepan and clean the blender canister.Bloom the gelatin in 2 tablespoons cold water. Heat the passion fruit mixture over low heat, whisking regularly as it thickens. Once it starts to boil, transfer back to the blender. Add the bloomed gelatin, butter, and salt, and beat until the mixture is super-smooth. Transfer to a container and chill in the fridge until completely cool. While it’s cooling, remove the rind of the grapefruit completely, leaving no white pith behind.  Then carefully remove each segment of grapefruit from its membrane by slicing down both sides of each segment along the membrane to the center of the fruit; the segments should come right out. In a small saucepan heat the oil and grapefruit on low heat, stirring occasionally. After about 2 minutes, the warm oil will help separate and encapsulate the individual grapefruit ‘kernels’. Remove from heat and let the kernels cool slightly before proceeding. Using a spoon or rubber spatula, gently stir the grapefruit kernels into the cooled passion fruit curd.Using a spoon or an offset spatula, spread the grapefruit passion curd evenly over the bottom of the Ritz crust. Put the pie in the freezer to set the curd until firm, about 30 minutes.Sweetened Condensed Grapefruit3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk2 tablespoons grapefruit juice1/2 teaspoon kosher salt1/2 teaspoon citric acid1 drop red food coloringCombine the sweetened condensed milk, grapefruit juice, salt, citric acid and food coloring in a medium bowl and mix with a rubber spatula by stirring and folding over the mixture until it is homogeneous.Using a spoon or an offset spatula, spread the sweetened condensed grapefruit on top of the curd, being careful not to mix the two layers and making sure the curd is entirely covered. Return to the freezer until ready to slice and serve. Wrapped (gently) in plastic, the pie can be frozen for up to 1 month. I'd recommend thawing the pie a little before serving because the filling can get a little icy straight out of the freezer.  Other than that, this is a really great pie, kind of like the grown up version of a key lime pie.  I think it'd make a nice change from all the more traditional apple and pumpkin pies at a holiday meal.  And I still can't get over how cool it is that there are little individual kernels of grapefruit suspended in the passion fruit curd.  Isn't it so pretty? Next:  Pretzel Ice Cream Pie with Homemade Magic ShellPreviously:  Duchikey (or Simplified Turducken)"},
{"title": "Duchikey (or Simplified Turducken)", "date": "Monday, November 12, 2012", "text": "The idea of making a turducken is kind of frightening:  deboning three different birds and then stuffing one inside the other inside the other and then roasting it all low and long enough so that it's cooked all the way through but not dry or burnt on the outside.  Crazy.But when Serious Eats posted a way to make a simplified turducken a couple of years ago by using cuts from all three birds instead of the whole birds, I knew I had to try it.  It's a pounded duck breast covered with a layer of stuffing covered with chicken thighs, another layer of stuffing, and then turkey cutlets.  Thus, a duchikey.  The Serious Eats post included a recipe for stuffing, but I decided to further simplify it by just using Stove Top stuffing, a personal guilty pleasure. Duchikey (based on the recipe from Serious Eats)makes 4 servings1 box Stove Top stuffing, prepared1 large duck breast (about 8 oz.)1/2 lb. boneless, skinless chicken thighs (2-3)1 turkey cutlet (about 1/4 lb.)1 tablespoon oil Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F.Lay duck breast skin-side down on cutting board with long edge perpendicular to edge of table. Using sharp chef's knife or boning knife, make one thin horizontal slit from left side of breast to right side, about 1/4 inch from the top, leaving 1/8th-inch connected on right side. Open like book. Repeat, making another cut from right to left and open duck breast like business letter. Place duck breast between two pieces of wax paper or plastic wrap and pound gently until roughly 1/3 of an inch thick. Refrigerate until needed. Pound chicken thighs between two sheets of wax paper with meat pounder or rolling pin until each one is even 1/3-inch thickness. Refrigerate until needed. Repeat with turkey cutlet.Lay opened duck breast skin side down on cutting board. Season with salt and pepper. Spread 3-4 tablespoons stuffing onto duck meat. Use back of spoon or offset spatula to smooth stuffing entirely over top of breast. Lay flattened chicken thighs on top of duck. Season with salt and pepper. Chicken layer should be the same size or slightly smaller than the duck layer. Trim chicken if necessary. Spread 3-4 tablespoons stuffing over chicken, smoothing with spatula or back of spoon. Lay turkey cutlet on chicken layer, trimming if necessary to fit over chicken. Season with salt and pepper. Spread 1 tablespoon stuffing over turkey. Place remaining stuffing in 13 x 9-inch baking pan.Roll duchikey jelly-roll style from left to right. Cut five 12-inch pieces of butcher's twine and lay parallel to each other in 1-inch intervals. Place duchikey on top and twine working from outside towards center to secure. Trim off excess twine. Season duchikey with salt and pepper.  Heat oil over medium-high heat in heavy 12-inch oven-proof cast iron or stainless steel skillet until shimmering. Add duchikey, duck skin side down, and brown on all sides, approximately 8 minutes total. Transfer duchikey and stuffing to oven and roast until instant read thermometer inserted into center of duchikey registers 150°F, about 30 minutes. Remove duchikey to cutting board, tent lightly with aluminum foil and let rest at least 10 minutes before slicing. I found that the original recipe called for too much turkey, so I halved the amount.  I liked that it was so much easier to make than a turducken, and it's perfect if you're just feeding a small crowd for Thanksgiving.  Moving the duck to the outside and browning it first gives you a really nice, crispy skin, too, without making the rest of the meat dry.Next:  Grapefruit PiePreviously:  Cereal Milk Ice Cream and PieFour years ago:  Homemade Crystallized Ginger"},

The recipe in the Momofuku Milk Bar cookbook called for powdered freeze-dried corn, which I just didn't feel like looking for or buying off the internet.  Luckily, I found this recipe on-line that doesn't use freeze-dried corn but instead steeps the ice cream base in caramelized cornflakes, which were similar enough to Cornflake Crunch that I just used that instead. Cereal Milk Ice Cream (adapted from Cafe Fernando)makes almost a quart1 recipe Cornflake Crunch (you really only need 3 1/2 cups, and you should have that much left over if you made the whole batch just to garnish the panna cotta)4 cups whole milk1/4 teaspoon salt4 large egg yolks1/2 cup sugar1 cup heavy cream1 teaspoon vanilla extract In a large bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups cornflake crunch with the whole milk and let steep for an hour.Strain the milk with the help of a fine-mesh sieve (make sure to press on the cornflakes with a spatula to extract as much liquid as possible).  You should get about 2 cups of cereal milk out of this.Combine the cereal milk and salt in a small pot and bring to a boil over medium heat. In the meantime, in a medium pot, whisk together egg yolks with sugar. Slowly pour the warm milk mixture into the yolks while whisking constantly.

{"title": "Margherita Pizza", "date": "Friday, November 2, 2012", "text": "After making the pasta sauce, I got a little bored of just eating it with spaghetti, so I decided to try to make my first margherita pizza.  The margherita pizza at Cosi is kind of my go-to lunch in the American Airlines terminal at Boston Logan because I love the crispy but chewy flatbread crust, the sweet tomato sauce, fresh basil, and especially the fresh mozzarella.For this pizza, I used the same thin crust pizza dough recipe from The Kitchn that I used for the crispy kale pizza and the chicken masala pizza and just a couple of tablespoons of tomato sauce.  You may be tempted to add more, but don't.  Too much sauce on the dough will leave it uncooked, and you won't get the nice crispy crust.Margherita Pizza (adapted from The Kitchn)makes one 10\" pizza1/2 lb. pizza dough2-3 tablespoons tomato sauce4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced2 tablespoons loosely packed fresh basil, sliced into ribbonsHeat the oven to 550°F or as hot as it can go. Place a baking stone or baking sheet in the oven as it heats. Shape dough into a 10\" circle on a piece of parchment paper. Spread a light layer of the sauce over the dough. Top with the slices of mozzarella. Leave some space between the pieces of mozzarella. Transfer the pizza on the parchment paper to the preheated baking stone or baking sheet (I used a flexible cutting board to do this). Bake for 5-10 minutes—exact cooking time will vary depending on your oven temperature. Pizzas are finished when the crust is deep brown with charred spots and the cheese is bubbling. Sprinkle pizza with basil as it comes out of the oven. Let cool briefly before slicing and serving. I wasn't able to the crust as browned as I wanted, but that's probably because I was reading the original pizza dough recipe that called for the oven to be set for 500°F instead of 550°F.  Next time I'll definitely crank up the heat as high as it can go, and I might try a fresh (vs. cooked) tomato sauce.Updated:  I've made this pizza with Ken Forkish's Same Day Straight Pizza Dough.  That dough is so much better!Next:  Cereal MilkPreviously:  The Famous Butter Tomato Sauce"},

Add a pinch or two of salt.  Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer.  Cook, uncovered, at a very slow but steady simmer, adjusting the heat as necessary, for about 45 minutes, or until droplets of fat float free from the tomato (this took me longer than 45 minutes).Stir occasionally, mashing any large pieces of tomato with the back of a wooden spoon (be careful; I ended up squirting myself a few times with hot tomato innards!).  Taste and salt as needed.  Discard the onion before tossing the sauce with cooked pasta. I actually washed the sauce off the onion and saved it in the fridge for the next time I needed to add softened onions to a dish.  If you want, you could just chop up the onions and throw them in the sauce, or blend them into the sauce, but I think the sauce is already perfectly balanced as is.  The only thing I would maybe add to the pasta is some shaved parmesan cheese."},

{"title": "Miso Marinated Black Cod", "date": "Friday, October 26, 2012", "text": "When I saw wild caught black cod in Trader Joe's most recent Fearless Flyer, I'm pretty sure I squealed out loud.  I had been wanting to make Nobu's miso marinated black cod ever since I first had it several years ago but could never bring myself to track down the, I assumed, extremely expensive fish.  And now it was being sold in my neighborhood TJ's for $12.99/lb, which admittedly, isn't cheap, but is definitely in my price range if I'm only buying enough for one. This is only of those super simple recipes that only uses the barest minimum of ingredients (four!) but is so, so good.  If you've never had black cod (also known as sablefish or butterfish) before, you'll be surprised by how buttery the flaky white meat is.  The closest fish that I've tasted is the Chilean sea bass.  And the best part is, black cod is a sustainable fish, unlike the Chilean sea bass, so that's one less thing you have to worry about.The fillets that I ended up buying were only a quarter pound each, but I decided to make the full amount of marinade anyways because, seriously, I don't have a pot small enough to boil 2 tablespoons of liquid.  I also didn't have any sake on hand, so I substituted rice wine. Miso Marinated Black Cod (based on the recipe from Nobu:  The Cookbook)makes 2 servings2 tablespoons sake or rice wine2 tablespoons mirin2 tablespoons white miso1 1/2 tablespoons sugar2-4 black cod fillets (about 1/4 pound each) Bring the sake and the mirin to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat.  Turn the heat down to low and stir in the miso until dissolved. Turn the heat up to high again and add the sugar, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat once the sugar is fully dissolved. Cool to room temperature. Slather the fish with the miso marinade and place in dish or bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Leave to steep in refrigerator for 2 to 3 days. To cook, preheat the broiler. Lightly wipe off any excess miso clinging to the fillets but don’t rinse it off. Broil the fillets for about 10-15 minutes, until browned on top and flaky when cut with a fork.  Do not overcook!  Serve warm with rice. My fillets were pretty thin (less than an inch thick), but if you have thicker fillets, you may want to continue to bake the fish at 400°F for another couple of minutes until it is cooked through.  Just remember not to overcook this fish since you'll lose the awesome, buttery texture."},
{"title": "Coconut Whipped Cream and Coconut Dulce de Leche", "date": "Wednesday, October 24, 2012", "text": "I've mentioned coconut whipped cream a couple of times before so I thought I'd share a quick post on how to make it.  I first heard about it on Oh She Glows, and I love the idea because it uses a non-perishable can of full-fat coconut milk instead of whipping cream, which I rarely keep on hand, which means I can have whipped cream just about any time I want.  Well, except for the fact that you do need to put the can of coconut milk in the fridge for at least a couple of hours. Angela flips the can before opening it so that the solid coconut cream is on the bottom, and you can easily pour out the translucent liquid.  Since not all cans are easy to open from the bottom, I've just put the cans upside down in the fridge and then opened them right side up.  Even if you forget to do this, you can still pretty easily scoop the solid stuff out of the top of the can, leaving the liquid at the bottom.  I usually save the liquid to make smoothies out of. Now put all that nice, solid coconut cream into a large bowl and beat it with a hand mixer.  It helps if you've chilled the bowl and the beaters in the fridge or freezer beforehand, but I've done it without chilling them first and it still worked out okay.  I like to start off with the regular beater attachments and then if it's not getting fluffy enough, I'll switch to the whisk attachment. After it's nice and fluffy, go ahead and add some sweetener (I used a tablespoon of sugar ground fine with some cardamon seeds) and vanilla extract if you like. And that's it!  I use this on my magical pumpkin spice lattes, on ice cream sundaes, and anywhere else you'd normally use whipped cream.  You can store it in the fridge for up to 10 days in a sealed container, and if it gets too hard, you can always whip it again.Now sometimes I open a can of coconut milk and find that the cream didn't rise to the top and harden.  Instead, I get a homogenous, opaque white liquid.  You can try pouring it into a sealed container and chilling it some more to see if it'll separate, or you can make coconut dulce de leche! Coconut Dulce de Leche (adapted from Bon Appétit)makes 1 1/4 cups1 14-oz. can full-fat coconut milk3/4 cup turbinado sugar1/4 teaspoon kosher saltWhisk coconut milk, sugar, and coarse salt in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.Increase heat to medium-high and boil until mixture is reduced to 1 1/4 cups, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. Transfer sauce to small jars.

{"title": "Cranberry Royale Sorbet", "date": "Monday, October 22, 2012", "text": "Last week I got to go on a Cranberry Farm Picking Experience with Colonial Lantern Tours.  I've gone apple picking and strawberry picking before, but this was the first time I've ever gone cranberry picking.  No, we didn't get to put on those rubber overalls and wade in a cranberry bog, but we did get to see how a flooded cranberry bog is harvested and also how cranberries are dry harvested.  Lastly, we got to hand pick our own cranberries!  Fun fact:  only 10% of cranberries are dry harvested, and only the dry harvested cranberries will be sold fresh in stores.  The other 90% are wet harvested and will go into cranberry products like cranberry sauce and cranberry juice. Even before I went on the tour, I started looking up cranberry recipes to try.  The ones that caught my eye were a bittersweet cranberry brownie and a pecan topped cranberry cake.  Then my friend Ellen suggested that I make Jeni's Cranberry Royale Sorbet.  And boy, am I glad she did.  Cranberry Royale Sorbet from Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Homemakes about 1 quart2 grapefruits (you need enough to get 3/4 cup of juice; I needed 1 1/2 large grapefruits)One 12-ounce bag cranberries (fresh or frozen)1 cup plus 2 tablespoons water1/4 cup light corn syrup1 1/2 cups sugar Using a vegetable peeler, remove 3 large strips of zest from 1 of the grapefruits.  Halve the grapefruits and squeeze 3/4 cup juice. Combine the grapefruit juice, zest, cranberries, water, corn syrup, and sugar in a 4-quart saucepan and bring to a boil.  Boil just until the cranberries begin to pop open, about 5 minutes.  (My cranberries started to pop before it was anywhere close to boiling, so I just put a splatter screen on top of the saucepan and continued to heat the pan.)  Remove from the heat and let cool. Remove the grapefruit zest.  If desired, puree the cranberry mixtures in batches, or leave unpureed for a chunkier sorbet. Chill the mixtue and then freeze in an ice cream maker.  Spin just until the consistency of very softly whipped cream. Pack the sorbet into a storage container, press a sheet of parchment directly against the surface, and seal with an airtight lid.  Freeze in the coldest part of your freezer until firm, at least 4 hours.  On the following page in her book, there's a gorgeous picture of an Oslo Ambrosia sundae, which consists of a meringue topped with raspberry lingonberry sauce, a scoop of the Cranberry Royale, and topped with cardamon scented whipped cream.  I just knew I had to try to make this sundae, if only because it looked so pretty.  Instead of making a raspberry lingonberry sauce, though, I just saved a few tablespoons of the sorbet base before it was frozen and added a spoonful of raspberry preserves.  I also used coconut whipped cream instead of dairy whipped cream and should be posting that recipe soon.  (Edited to add:  here's the post!)"},

If the soup seems too thick, add more stock or water and reheat gently. Add salt and pepper to taste. To serve, garnish with fresh thyme and a few pieces of popcorn. The final verdict:  I liked how creamy the soup was even without any added cream.  But it still tasted like carrots.  =/  If you like carrots, you'll like this soup.  In the meantime, I think I'll stick to making Carrot Cake Cupcakes with Orange Cream Cheese Frosting, Carrot Cake Ice Cream, or Curried Carrot Soup the next time I get carrots.  Or maybe I should just put carrots on my no-list again."},

As another option, you can make a pumpkin spice frappuccino by blending ice with extra strong cold brew, pumpkin butter, and milk.  I've found that the pumpkin butter is also excellent on toasted amnesty bread.  =)"},

If you have a pizza stone, put it in the lower-middle part of the oven now.Combine the water and yeast in a mixing bowl, and stir to dissolve the yeast. The mixture should look like thin miso soup. Add the flour and salt to the bowl and mix until you've formed a shaggy dough. Knead for 5 minutes (I used my stand mixer and the dough hook). Cover the dough with a moist towel and let rise for an hour.  (According to the recipe, you can skip the wait and go ahead and use the pizza dough now, but you might as well let it rise while you prepare the toppings.) In the meantime, wash and tear up the kale into bite-sized pieces.  Dry well (I used a salad spinner) and dress with a few glugs of olive oil; add salt and black pepper to taste. Mince or press 2 garlic cloves and add to the kale.  Mix well and set aside. Slice the onions into thin rings.  Heat a non-stick pan on medium high and add the onions.  Stir occasionally, and once the onions start to blacken and stick, add a little olive oil.  Continue to stir and cook the onions, adding a little more olive oil when dry, until crispy and slightly burnt.When ready to make the pizza, tear off two pieces of parchment paper roughly 12-inches wide. Divide the dough in two. You can refrigerate this dough (covered in olive oil) for up to 3 days at this point. Working with one piece of the dough at a time, form it into a large disk with your hands and lay it on the parchment paper.Work from the middle of the dough outwards, using the heel of your hand to gently press and stretch the dough until it's about 1/4 of an inch thick or less. For an extra-thin crust, roll it with a rolling pin. If the dough starts to shrink back, let it rest for five minutes and then continue rolling. Spoon a few tablespoons of olive oil into the center of the pizza and use the back of a spoon to spread it out to the edges. Add half of the crispy, burnt onions. Pile on half the kale.  (It will seem like a lot, but don't worry, the kale will shrink a lot in the oven.) Top with a few shavings of parmesan cheese.Using a bread peel or the backside of a baking sheet (I used a flexible cutting board), slide your pizza (still on the parchment) onto the baking stone in the oven. If you don't have a baking stone, bake the pizza right on the baking sheet.Bake for about 5 minutes and then rotate the pizza. Bake for another 3 to 5 minutes until the crust is golden-brown and the cheese looks toasty.Remove the pizza from oven and let it cool on a wire rack. Repeat with shaping, topping, and baking second pizza.Let both pizzas cool for about five minutes before slicing and serving.I really loved how all the ingredients came together in this pizza.  The pizza crust was thin enough to get a nice crunch but still has some chew.  I was surprised to find that the kale crisped up almost as much as kale chips, and the onions added a nice sweetness while the parmesan added a good shot of umami.  I only made one of the pizzas and stored half of the dough in the fridge, but I'm definitely going to be making this again very soon.Update:  I've made this pizza again using Ken Forkish's Same Day Straight Dough Pizza Dough.  That dough is so much better!"},
{"title": "Brown Butter Marshmallow Popcorn", "date": "Wednesday, October 10, 2012", "text": "When I saw this recipe for Caramel Marshmallow Popcorn, I just knew I had to make it.  Rice Krispies Treats are one of my favorite snacks, and well, you all know how much I love popcorn.  The only thing is, I noticed in a couple of the comments that the popcorn would get really, really hard after it cooled down, and I wanted something more like the softer texture of Rice Krispies treats rather than caramel corn.I figured the reason it was getting hard was the addition of brown sugar, so I decided to stick with a more traditional Rice Krispies treat recipe with just marshmallows and butter.  But I couldn't help tweaking it a bit based on my friend Ilene's Brown Butter Rice Krispies Treats post by first browning the butter and adding some vanilla bean and salt.Brown Butter Marshmallow Popcorn1 stick (1/2 cup) butter1/2 vanilla bean1 10 oz. bag mini marshmallows1/2 teaspoon kosher salt9 cups popped popcorn (unpopped kernels removed) In a large pot, melt the butter on low heat. Split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise, and scrape out the seeds.  Add to the melted butter.Continue to cook the butter on low until the milk solids start to brown.Remove from heat, add the salt and mini marshmallows and stir to combine. Return the pot to low heat and stir to completely melt the marshmallows. Once the marshmallows have completely melted, add the popcorn and stir to combine. Line a baking dish with parchment paper and spray with baking spray.  Pour the popcorn into the dish and allow to cool.The cooled popcorn never got as crunchy as Rice Krispies Treat do, but that might be because I didn't use a full 9 cups of popcorn and the popcorn to marshmallow ratio was off.  I really loved how the vanilla bean and browned butter brought the marshmallows and popcorn to a-whole-nother level.  When I make this again, I'd probably add more salt and maybe some butter flavoring to reinforce the popcorn flavor (as well as make sure I have enough popcorn to start off with). Or just use a bag of butter flavored microwave popcorn!  =)"},
{"title": "Hot Crash Potatoes", "date": "Monday, October 8, 2012", "text": "I got this recipe from The Pioneer Woman, who calls these Crash Hot Potatoes, but for whatever reason, I keep calling them Hot Crash Potatoes in my head.  Maybe because it sounds more like hot cross buns or hot mashed potatoes.  Regardless, whenever I get small potatoes in my Boston Organics delivery, I get really excited because it means I can make these.It's not the fastest recipe, and you end up having to use multiple pieces of cookware (since you have to first boil and then bake the potatoes), but in my opinion, it's worth it.  These potatoes end up exponentially crispier than regular roasted potatoes without all the mess and greasiness involved with frying.  The only thing is, my potatoes have never been as photogenic as the ones on The Pioneer Woman's site.  Hers remain in one piece, and she writes that, \"you almost want it to resemble a cookie.\"  Mine split in half and look more like Humpty Dumpty after he fell off the wall. But since I'm usually just making these for myself to eat, I don't really care.  I just continue to smoosh them until there's plenty of surface area for the olive oil to catch onto and make crispy.Hot Crash Potatoes (from The Pioneer Woman)New Potatoes (or other small, round potatoes)Olive OilKosher Salt to tasteBlack Pepper to tasteRosemary (or other herbs, I used Thyme) to tasteBring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add in as many potatoes as you wish to make and cook them until they are fork-tender, about 20-30 minutes depending on the size of the potatoes.  Drain well. Preheat oven to 450°F.  On a sheet pan (I line mine with a Silpat), generously drizzle olive oil. Place tender potatoes on the cookie sheet and with a potato masher (I use a slotted spoon), gently press down each potato until it slightly mashes, rotate the potato masher 90 degrees and mash again. Crowd the potatoes close to each other and carefully drizzle olive oil on top, making sure that almost all the surfaces are covered with oil. Sprinkle potatoes with kosher salt, fresh ground black pepper and fresh chopped rosemary (or chives or thyme or whatever herb you have available).  Now spread the potatoes further apart on the sheet.Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown.Edited to add:   I wanted to make these today but the only potatoes I had were a little too large so I just cut them in half before adding them to the boiling water.  Then I put them skin side down on the sheet before smooshing them.  They looked a lot more like the Pioneer Woman's potatoes this way but turned out less crispy because the cut side was exposed to the boiling water.  They were still really delicious, though, and it took less time to boil them so this was definitely a \"why didn't I think of that before?\" moment."},
{"title": "Garlic Thyme Popcorn", "date": "Friday, October 5, 2012", "text": "I still had a lot of fresh thyme left after making the Caramelized Onion and Swiss Chard Quiche so when I saw this recipe on Gilt Taste, I got really excited.  I already had all the ingredients, and I love popcorn! Well, I had all the ingredients except for the duck fat.  =(  But I remember reading somewhere that popping corn in coconut oil was really delicious, so I used that instead for the popping oil and used substituted butter for the dressing.  You can't go wrong with butter on popcorn, right? Garlic Thyme Popcorn (based on Francis Lam's recipe)Makes 2 quarts, enough for 2-4 people as a serious snack3 tablespoons butter7 fresh thyme sprigs, leaves stripped and chopped (about 1 tablespoon leaves)1-2 garlic cloves, smashed (1 is lovely and balanced, 2 is more heady)1 1”x2” strip orange peel3 tablespoons coconut oil1/3 cup popping cornFine salt, to tasteGrated orange zest, to taste, for garnishIn the smallest saucepan you have, melt the butter over very low heat. Add about 2/3 of the thyme leaves, the thyme stems, garlic, and orange peel and gently infuse for 12-15 minutes. If the butter gets hot enough to start sizzling more than just a whisper, take it off heat for a minute or two, then place it back on the heat.Heat the coconut oil and 4 kernels of popcorn over medium-high heat in the 3-quart saucepan. Cover the pot.Once the tester kernels have popped, add the rest of the corn and shake the pan so that they’re laying in one layer. Add a few pinches of salt, cover the pan, take it off the heat, and count to 30.Put the pan back on the heat, and wait for some hot popping action. As it starts to go, gently shake the pan to let the unpopped kernels fall back to the bottom, and every few seconds lift the lid ever so slightly to let some steam escape. Once the popping slows to a few seconds between pops, turn off the heat and uncover the pot.Taste a few pieces for salt. Sprinkle on some more salt, if needed. Remove the garlic cloves, thyme stems, and orange peel from the butter, and evenly spoon the “dressing” onto the popcorn, stirring and tossing to get an even coat. Taste the popcorn 2/3 of the way through the dressing; you may like it less dressed. Add remaining dressing if you’d like. Finish popcorn by sprinkling the remaining thyme leaves all over the top. Grate on a little more orange zest (I used a Microplane for this), and serve. It keeps in a covered container for 2-3 days. If you like, you can refresh it in a warm oven for a few minutes before serving. I'd like to repeat that you should taste the popcorn after dressing it with 2/3 of the butter.  I forgot that step and added all the butter to the popcorn.  It was definitely too much for me, which is saying a lot, considering how much I like buttered popcorn."},

{"title": "Caramelized Onion and Swiss Chard Quiche", "date": "Saturday, September 29, 2012", "text": "This quiche is good.  How good?  Good enough to rouse me out of a 2+ year hiatus to post about it.  That's how good.  It's loosely based on this recipe from Smitten Kitchen, but I had yellow onions instead of leeks, so I decided to caramelize them first, using the dry pan method which has been working pretty well for me. So what makes this dish so good?  Maybe it's the thyme, which I think is my new favorite herb.  I remember the first time I tasted Stove Top stuffing and wondering what that new, wonderful flavor was.  Growing up in a Taiwanese home, the only herbs I was used to tasting were scallion and cilantro.  But after almost 20 years of wondering, I think I can now identify that herb as thyme!  Now if only I could figure out what goes into the Long John Silver's batter.Another new fresh ingredient I've discovered is nutmeg.  I used to just use the stuff that came out of a spice bottle and never really understood what the big deal was.  Then one day I saw some whole nutmeg at the bulk spice rack at Harvest and decided to pick up a couple since I had a Microplane I could use to shave it with.  Well let me tell you, fresh nutmeg is a completely different species from the dried stuff!  I am definitely a fresh nutmeg convert now.  Just remember, a little goes a long way, so don't over do it.  Caramelized Onion and Swiss Chard Quichemakes 1 quiche1 prepared whole wheat pie crust, thawed but chilled (regular pie crust would work, too)2 yellow onions, chopped1 teaspoon fresh thyme, stems removed2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter 1/2 bunch Swiss chard, ribs removed, leaves chopped (about 2 1/2 cups)1 cup half and half 4 large eggs1 teaspoon salt1/4 teaspoon ground black pepperPinch of fresh ground nutmegHeat a large non-stick pan to medium high and add chopped onions.  Cook until browned but not burnt, about 6 minutes. Add a tablespoon of butter, the fresh thyme, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Lower the heat to medium and continue to stir while cooking.  Add the remaining tablespoon of butter when the onions become dry and start sticking to the pan, about another 5 minutes. Once the onions are evenly caramelized, about another 5 minutes, add the chard and sauté until wilted, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool. Preheat to 425°F.  In a medium bowl, whisk the half and half and next 4 ingredients. Mix in cooled onion and chard mixture.  Pour filling into crust.  Place pie on a baking sheet to make it easier to transport and in case the filling overflows in the oven. Bake quiche for 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350°F and bake until filling is puffed and just set in center, about 10-12 minutes longer.  Transfer to rack and cool 10 minutes.  Serve hot or at room temperature. You'll probably notice that there was no cheese in this quiche recipe.  Believe me, it doesn't need it.  But if you really want, you could probably throw in a handful of shredded cheddar or Gruyère."},
{"title": "Slow Cooker Bolognese Sauce", "date": "Friday, July 2, 2010", "text": "A few weeks ago I had eaten some pasta with bolognese sauce at Basta Pasta in Cambridge, and afterwards, I was totally craving more of the savory meat sauce.  I remembered that The Kitchen had posted a recipe for making it using a slow cooker which sounded perfect, since I didn't really want to have to deal with hours in front of a hot stove during the summertime.  Even so, you do need to spend some time sweating the vegetables, browning the meat, and reducing the liquids, but the end result is so totally worth it.  The only changes I made to the original recipe is that instead of adding 1 cup of the reserved tomato juices, I reduced all the tomato juice from the 2 cans until there was only about 1 cup of liquid left and added that to the slow cooker.  Also, I used a pound of ground beef and a pound of ground pork instead just ground beef.Slow-Cooked Bolognese Sauce (from The Kitchn)makes 6 cups1 tablespoon olive oil1 medium onion, finely chopped2 celery stalks, finely chopped1 medium carrot, finely chopped3 cloves of garlic, minced1 pound ground beef1 pound ground pork1/8 teaspoon nutmeg1 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon pepper1 cup milk (whole or 2-percent)1 cup white wine2 28-ounce cans of whole peeled tomatoes, drained and finely chopped (juices reserved)1 cup reserved tomato juicesHeat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, and carrot and cook until the onion is translucent and all the vegetables have softened. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the pork and beef, breaking it apart with your spoon and cooking until it is just browned. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper.Stir in the milk and bring it to a rapid simmer. Continue simmering until the milk has reduced completely and very little liquid remains, about 10 minutes. Stir in the wine and simmer again until reduced completely, about 10 minutes. Transfer the beef mixture to the slow cooker.In the same, now-empty pot, reduce the reserved tomato juices until you have about 1 cup left.Add the chopped tomatoes and reduced tomato juices to the slow cooker. Stir to combine. Cover and cook on HIGH for 6 hours or LOW for 8 hours. In the last half hour of cooking, remove the lid to allow any excess liquid to evaporate and reduce the sauce. The finished sauce should be chunky and creamy without being soupy.Serve over spaghetti with a hunk of crusty bread for mopping up the sauce!"},
{"title": "Coconut Lime Sorbet", "date": "Thursday, July 1, 2010", "text": "Every once in a while I'll scan Craigslist to see if anyone's selling an ice cream maker with its own compressor.  They're usually several hundred dollars, so it's something that would be nice to have, but definitely not necessary, especially since I have such a reliable Cuisinart ICE-20.  But a couple of weeks ago, I found one being sold for only $80.  I was a little suspicious so I asked the seller why he was selling it, and he said that he was getting married, and his wife-to-be wanted him to get rid of stuff.  Well, I was more than happy to help him out.  It was a nice surprise when he included four ice cream sundae glasses, an ice cream scoop, and two ice cream recipe books with it as well!The ice cream maker in question is a Lello 4070 Gelato Junior, and I love it!  No more needing to pre-freeze the canister; I don't even need to chill the ice cream base before starting up the machine!  The only thing I miss about my Cuisinart is that I can't really get any good pictures of the ice cream as it's churning....One recipe I really wanted to try out in my new ice cream maker was this one for coconut lime sorbet.  It's definitely one of my all-time favorite ice creams to make, and even won the ice cream thrown down I participated in a couple of years ago.  But it doesn't always freeze well.  There's definitely been a couple of times when the Cuisinart canister started melting before the sorbet was done churning.  So I knew that it would be a good way to test how well the Lello ice cream maker worked.Coconut Lime Sorbet (from epicurious)makes about 1 pint15-ounce can cream of coconut (preferably Coco Lopez)3/4 cup water1/2 cup fresh lime juiceIn a bowl whisk together ingredients. Freeze mixture in an ice-cream maker. Transfer sorbet to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden. I love the fact that there are only three ingredients for this sorbet; two, if you don't count the water.  Also, you don't need to heat or chill the base before freezing.  In fact, you shouldn't chill the base because then the coconut fat would solidify out of the mixture.  What I think is kind of interesting is that it does harden when you're churning it, but since it's dissipated throughout the sorbet, it almost forms chips of coconut fat, adding a little bit of texture.  I think it's almost a misnomer to label this treat a sorbet because, even though it doesn't contain any dairy, it's so super rich!  The sweetness from the cream of coconut and the tartness from the fresh lime juice is also really intense. I've used bottled lime juice before in a pinch when I didn't have any fresh limes, and it tasted just as good.  I would definitely NOT substitute coconut milk for the cream of coconut, though.  Cream of coconut is a lot sweeter and fattier than coconut milk; if you use coconut milk instead it just won't have the right amount of sweetness or texture.  Trust me on this one.  One last thing, just as this sorbet doesn't freeze well, it also melts rather quickly, so make sure you take it out only right before you want to serve it."},
{"title": "Bruschetta", "date": "Monday, June 28, 2010", "text": "I went to Trader Joe's Friday night intending to just pick up some sugar and something for dinner when I got stopped by the gorgeous display of basil plants outside on sale.  I'd had a couple of basil plants before, but because I travel so much and they need regular watering, I'd never managed to keep them alive for long.  But these were so cheap, I justified getting another one by reasoning that it would have cost just as much to get a package of fresh basil leaves, and these could have the chance of being sustainable.Having your own basil plant not only means needing to water it regularly (by the way, how often is \"regularly\" anways?) but also needing to cook a lot more with basil since the plant is so prolific!  I was going to the beach on Saturday, so I decided I'd make a bruschetta topping and pack some marinated mozzarella balls and bagel chips (both also from TJ's) for lunch.  I used the grape tomatoes and garlic I got in my Boston Organics delivery and just added 4 other ingredients:  olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper.  I liked using the grape tomatoes because they have a lot of flavor, are a little sweeter, and are almost never mealy like salad tomatoes can get.Bruschettamakes about 4 servings1 pint grape tomatoesHandful of fresh basil leaves1 large garlic clove3 tablespoons olive oil1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar (I used white)Salt and pepperChop up the grape tomatoes using a serrated knife.  Depending on the size of the tomato, I cut them into 4, 6, or 8 pieces each.  Chop up the basil and throw it in with the tomatoes.Crush the garlic clove using a garlic press (or mince it by hand) and add to the tomatoes as well.Drizzle with the olive oil and vinegar.  Mix well and salt and pepper to taste.  Let sit for a bit to macerate.  Serve with slices of toasted French bread or bagel chips.These pictures are of the bruschetta right after it's been mixed together.  It gets a lot more liquidy and wilted but starts to taste better and better as the flavors mix.  Unfortunately, I didn't get any pictures of the bruschetta once it got to that point because I had gone to get a popsicle, and when I came back, the bruschetta was all gone.  I think Jenny was even trying to lick the plastic container clean."},
{"title": "Bacon Caramel Maple Ice Cream", "date": "Wednesday, June 23, 2010", "text": "I wasn't planning on doing another post on bacon and caramel after posting about bacon fat caramels and bacon caramel corn.  But then I met the girl behind 3am Confections, Erika, and she started telling me about the bacon caramels that she makes, and I just knew I had to have some.  These actually aren't on her website, but she made me a batch anyways and even hand-delivered them to me!  Like the caramels I made, they're topped with Maldon salt and diced bacon.  Unlike mine, they're butter based instead of made with bacon fat, which means they're not as soft at room temperature.  Another huge difference is that she fries the bacon with a secret ingredient that gives the bacon a subtle kick.After eating four of these in a row (because I couldn't stop myself), I decided to assert some self control because I wanted to immortalize these in an ice cream.  At first I was thinking of just dicing them up and adding them to a sweet cream base so as to really highlight the caramels themselves.  But then I came up with the idea of adding them to a maple ice cream since I do so love dipping my bacon slices in maple syrup.  I based the maple ice cream on the maple walnut ice cream recipe from Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream & Dessert Book.Bacon Caramel Maple Ice Creammakes about 1 pint1 large egg4 tablespoons sugar1/2 cup milk1 cup heavy cream4 tablespoons maple syrup, grade B1/2 cup 3am Confections bacon caramels, diced (about 8 caramels)Whisk egg until light and frothy.  Add sugar,  a little at a time and whisk to dissolve.  Add heavy cream, milk, and maple syrup.  Cover and chill.Freeze mixture in ice cream maker until almost firm, then fold in caramels.   Transfer ice cream to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden.I found the maple flavoring to be really subtle; if I had some, I probably would add some maple extract to the ice cream base to bring out the maple flavor even more.  The recipe in the Ben & Jerry's book suggests using a grade C maple syrup which would probably help as well.The caramels get pretty hard, but not to the point where it will crack your teeth or anything.  If it's something you're wary of, though, I'd suggest dicing the caramels finely so that you don't get a big hard gob in your mouth.After a post about World Peace Cookies, it only seems appropriate to follow up with a post on Amnesty Bread.  The idea for the name came from David Lebovitz's Amnesty Cookies, which are really Compost Cookies.  But the theory is that you declare a day of amnesty for your fridge and pantry and just throw everything you want to get rid of into this bread.  I had a zucchini, a pear, and two bananas from my Boston Organics delivery that needed to be used up plus some leftover dried cranberries and walnuts.  If I had had carrots I would've grated those up and thrown them in here, too.  Raisins, chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, and other types of nuts would certainly have worked just as well in here.  If you make any substitutions, I'd recommend trying to keep it a total of 2 cups of grated veggies or fruits and 1 cup total of dried fruits, nuts, or chocolate.Amnesty Breadmakes 2 loaves or 24 muffins3 eggs3/4 cup vegetable oil2/3 cup packed brown sugar1/2 cup white sugar1 zucchini, grated1 pear, peeled, cored, and grated2 bananas, mashed2 teaspoons vanilla extract3 cups all-purpose flour, divided1 tablespoon ground cinnamon1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder1 teaspoon baking soda1 teaspoon salt1/2 cup dried cranberries1/2 cup chopped walnutsPreheat oven to 325°F. Grease and flour two 8\"x4\" bread loaf pans, a 10\" tube pan, or line 24 muffin tins.In a large bowl, beat eggs until light yellow and frothy. Add oil, brown sugar, white sugar, grated zucchini, pear, bananas, and vanilla; blend together until well combined. Stir in 2 3/4 cups of the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Toss the remaining 1/4 cup flour with the cranberries and nuts and mix in with the rest of the batter.  Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared loaf pans or muffin tins.Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes for the loaf pans and tube pan and 35 minutes for the muffins.It's not the prettiest of breads or muffins, but it certainly does its job, which is to use up all those ingredients in a yummy way.  It's quite moist, thanks to all the zucchini and fruits, but also a sturdy enough bread that you could slice and toast it and serve it with some butter."},

I made a whole batch, meaning to bring them to a party, but they were so good I decided to keep most of them for myself.  They're perfect eating with a glass of cold milk, and if I had had any vanilla ice cream on hand, I would have totally made ice cream sandwiches with them.World Peace Cookies (from Dorie Greenspan's Baking:  From My Home to Yours)makes about 36 cookies1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder1/2 teaspoon baking soda1 stick plus 3 tablespoons (11 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature2/3 cup (packed) light brown sugar1/4 cup sugar1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel or 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract5 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped into chips, or a generous 3/4 cup store-bought mini chocolate chipsSift the flour, cocoa and baking soda together.Working with a stand mixer, preferably fitted with a paddle attachment, or with a hand mixer in a large bowl, beat the butter on medium speed until soft and creamy. Add both sugars, the salt and vanilla extract and beat for 2 minutes more.Turn off the mixer. Pour in the dry ingredients, drape a kitchen towel over the stand mixer to protect yourself and your kitchen from flying flour and pulse the mixer at low speed about 5 times, a second or two each time. Take a peek — if there is still a lot of flour on the surface of the dough, pulse a couple of times more; if not, remove the towel. Continuing at low speed, mix for about 30 seconds more, just until the flour disappears into the dough — for the best texture, work the dough as little as possible once the flour is added, and don't be concerned if the dough looks a little crumbly. Toss in the chocolate pieces and mix only to incorporate.Turn the dough out onto a work surface, gather it together and divide it in half. Working with one half at a time, shape the dough into logs that are 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap the logs in plastic wrap and refrigerate them for at least 3 hours. (The dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months. If you've frozen the dough, you needn't defrost it before baking — just slice the logs into cookies and bake the cookies 1 minute longer.)Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 325°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats.Using a sharp thin knife, slice the logs into rounds that are 1/2 inch thick. (The rounds are likely to crack as you're cutting them — don't be concerned, just squeeze the bits back onto each cookie.) Arrange the rounds on the baking sheets, leaving about 1 inch between them.Bake the cookies one sheet at a time for 12 minutes — they won't look done, nor will they be firm, but that's just the way they should be. Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and let the cookies rest until they are only just warm, at which point you can serve them or let them reach room temperature."},

Then I tried it at Toro a couple of weeks ago, and wow, I couldn't get enough of it!  (As an aside, I had always assumed that Toro was a Japanese sushi place because to me, toro = fatty bluefin tuna belly.  So I was a little surprised to find out it was actually a tapas restaurant, where toro = Spanish for bull.)A couple days later I was going to a bbq, so I decided to look up how to make it myself.  What I came up with is an amalgam of what I found and a few adjustments to make the corn more similar to how I remember they made it at Toro.  I chose to pre-cook the corn before grilling it so that I could ensure that the corn was cooked all the way through and also so that I wouldn't be hogging up time and space on the grill.  I also added some raw garlic and the spices to the mayonnaise since I remember there was a garlicky taste in their sauce, which was pink.  I found the cotija cheese, a mild, aged cheese, at Whole Foods, but if you can't find it, you can substitute either grated Parmesan or crumbled feta cheese.Elote (Mexican Grilled Corn)makes 12 servings12 ears of corn1 cup mayonnaise2 garlic cloves4 limesCayenne pepperChili powderPaprika1 cup crumbled cotija cheesePreheat oven to 350 °F.  Place corn in husks directly on the middle rack of the oven for 30 minutes, or until corn is soft to the touch.  After it has cooled, remove the silk and husks.  If you like, you can break the ears in half.Run the garlic cloves through a garlic press (or mince well) and add to the mayonnaise.  Add the juice from half of a lime and quarter the rest of the limes.  Mix in cayenne pepper, chili powder, and paprika to taste.Grill the corn on a hot grill until lightly charred.  Top with the mayonnaise sauce and crumbled cotija cheese.  Sprinkle on more cayenne pepper and/or chili powder as desired, and serve with lime wedges."},
{"title": "Homemade Dulce de Leche and Dulce de Leche Ice Cream", "date": "Monday, June 14, 2010", "text": "Hola!  Did you miss me?  Sorry for the unexpected break, but the last month has been full of exciting happenings including bumping into the cast of Glee on a flight from Chicago to New York, racing in the Boston Dragon Boat Festival with The Boat for Kids Who Don't Paddle Good, and a vacation to Argentina and Brazil.It was down in Buenos Aires that I fell in love with dulce de leche.  I used my Marriott points to stay at the Marriott Plaza Hotel, and because I'm a Gold Elite member, we got to eat breakfast in the Concierge Lounge each morning.  And each morning they put out little jars of dulce de leche to spread on the pastries.  It was so good, I ended up putting some in my coffee, too!  I just knew I had to try to make some at home, and luckily, there is a rather easy (and safe*) method.  Basically all you do is put a can (or two or three) of sweetened condensed milk in a crock pot, fill it with water, turn it on low, and let it cook for 8 hours.  That's it!  Obviously, you'll want to wait for the cans to come back down to room temperature before attempting to open them, or else you'll risk having hot dulce de leche squirting out of the can.I'll admit that it doesn't taste quite as good as the real thing, but for how easy it was to make, it's pretty darn close.  Now my only problem was what to do with the dulce de leche.  See, while it was great spreading it all over pastries and stirring into my coffee, I don't really have pastries just sitting around at home, nor do I usually make coffee at home.  So I figured I'd look for a recipe to make dulce de leche ice cream.  I came across this one on Epicurious with the following description:  \"This is not just the best dulce de leche ice cream we've ever had, it's one of the best ice creams we've ever had, period.\"  With a testimonial like that, how could I not try to make it?Dulce de Leche Ice Cream with Toasted Pecans (from Epicurious)makes about 1.5 quarts2 cups whole milk1 cup heavy cream1 pound dulce de leche (this ended up being a little more than 1 can of homemade dulce de leche)1/8 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3/4 cup chopped pecans (2 1/2 to 3 oz), toastedBring milk and cream just to a boil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, then remove from heat and whisk in dulce de leche until dissolved. Whisk in vanilla and transfer to a metal bowl. Quick-chill by putting bowl in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and stirring occasionally until cold, 15 to 20 minutes.Freeze mixture in ice cream maker until almost firm, then fold in pecans.Transfer ice cream to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden, at least 1 hour.To be honest, I still think the passion fruit ice cream was the best ice cream I ever made.  But this one is definitely high up on the list.  The addition of the toasted pecans almost made it taste like butter pecan ice cream, but with a richer, caramelized flavor.  Probably the hardest part of making this was making sure the pecans didn't burn when toasting them.  I almost always end up throwing out the first batch because I forget about them and soon I'm left with blackened, useless pecans.  So make sure you keep a careful eye on the pecans!  The added flavor from toasting them is so worth the extra effort.*Safe because the alternative way to make this is to add a can of sweetened condensed milk to boiling water and boiling it for several hours, which could possibly lead to exploding cans.  One of my friends from Taiwan used to call this, \"Danger Pudding\" for that reason."},
{"title": "Passion Fruit Ice Cream", "date": "Tuesday, May 4, 2010", "text": "I still had a lot of passion fruit pulp left over from making the lilikoi malasadas so I thought I'd try to make some passion fruit ice cream.  This recipe uses whole eggs just like my favorite strawberry ice cream recipe.  I noticed that when cooking the custard, it doesn't get as thick as the yolk-only custards before it threatens to curdle.  So make sure you don't look for it to coat the back of your spoon and take it off the heat as soon as it reaches 170°F.Because I only had one cup of heavy cream, I divided all the ingredients by a third except for the passion fruit.  Quite a few of the comments for the recipe mentioned adding more pulp so I added more proportionally.Passion Fruit Ice Cream (adapted from the recipe on epicurious)makes about a pint1/2 cup sugar1 large egg1 cup heavy cream1/2 cup passion fruit pulpWhisk together sugar and egg. Heat cream in a small heavy saucepan over moderate heat until it just reaches a boil, then add hot cream to egg mixture in a slow stream, whisking. Pour custard into saucepan.Cook custard over moderately low heat, stirring constantly, until it registers 170°F on an instant-read or candy thermometer (do not let boil). Pour custard through a fine sieve into a clean bowl and cool completely. Stir in passion fruit pulp, then chill, covered, until cold.  Freeze custard in ice cream maker. Transfer to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden.Can I just say, I really, really love this ice cream.  It's light and tart and sweet and tropical sunshine on a spoon.  It's so super delicious I only need a couple of spoonfuls to be happy.  Just knowing that I have some sitting in my freezer waiting for me makes me happy.  You should definitely make this ice cream so you can be happy, too.  =)"},

And these cookies deserve an audience.Sure, the name might cause people to pause, but I'm guessing the reason behind it is that you throw a little bit of everything into these cookies:  potato chips, pretzels, chocolate chips, etc.  If you're a fan of the sweet and salty, you'll love these cookies.  I ended up making a batch of the 6 oz. cookies and a batch of cookies where I portioned out the dough into 1\" balls, which ended up giving me about 50 \"normal\" sized cookies.  And to save time, I alternated between using a parchment lined stoneware baking sheet and a silpat lined metal baking sheet, both of which worked well in protecting the cookies from getting burnt.Compost Cookies (from here)makes 15 big cookies or 50 smaller cookies1 cup unsalted butter1 cup sugar3/4 cup light brown sugar1 tablespoon corn syrup1 teaspoon vanilla extract2 large eggs1 3/4 cups AP flour2 teaspoons baking powder1 teaspoon baking soda2 teaspoons kosher salt1 1/2 cups your favorite baking ingredients!  (I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and Heath toffee bits)1 1/2 cups your favorite snack foods (I used Wavy potato chips and peanut butter pretzel sandwiches)In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream butter, sugars and corn syrup on medium high for 2-3 minutes until fluffy and pale yellow in color. Scrape down the sides of the mixing bowl with a spatula.On a lower speed, add eggs and vanilla to incorporate. Increase mixing speed to medium-high and start a timer for 10 minutes. During this time the sugar granules will fully dissolve, the mixture will become an almost pale white color and your creamed mixture will double in size.When time is up, add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix by hand just until your dough comes together and all remnants of dry ingredients have incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the mixing bowl with a spatula.Add in the hodgepodge of your favorite baking ingredients and mix until they are evenly incorporated into the dough. Add in your favorite snack foods last, until they are just incorporated.Portion cookie dough into 6 oz. mounds onto a plate.  Wrap portioned cookie dough tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a minimum of 1 hour or up to 1 week.DO NOT BAKE your cookies from room temperature or they will not hold their shape.Preheat the conventional oven to 400°F.When the oven reads 400°F and your cookie dough has been chilled at least an hour, roll the cookie dough mounds into balls and arrange on a parchment or silpat-lined sheet pan a minimum of 4\" apart in any direction.Bake 9-11 minutes. While in the oven, the cookies will puff, crackle and spread.At 9 minutes the cookies should be browned on the edges and just beginning to brown towards the center. Leave the cookies in the oven for the additional minutes if these colors don't match up and your cookies stills seem pale and doughy on the surface.Cool the cookies completely on the sheet pan before transferring to a plate or an airtight container or tin for storage. At room temperature, cookies will keep fresh 5 days. In the freezer, cookies will keep fresh 1 month."},
{"title": "Lilikoi Malasadas (Portuguese Donuts filled with Passion Fruit Curd)", "date": "Monday, April 26, 2010", "text": "About a month ago, I got an e-mail from my brother with a link to a recipe for lilikoi malasadas.  He asked if I thought they would be hard to make because he had had some in Hawaii and they were \"amaaazing\".  I skimmed through the recipe quickly and replied, \"Doesn't sound that hard as long as you can get me some unsweetened lilikoi (or passion fruit) concentrate and unsweetened guava concentrate.  No idea where I'd even find that stuff....  Also, if you can get me a stand mixer with a dough hook, I'd be all set.\"  And that was the end of that conversation.Until last week when I announced on Facebook that I had finally caved in and bought a KitchenAid stand mixer.  While most of my friends were congratulating me on the purchase, Timmy's only comment was \"can you try making those lilikoi malasadas now?\"  Can you tell he's a younger brother?There was still the issue of finding lilikoi concentrate and guava concentrate in the Boston area.  I checked Shaws and Harvest and even Whole Foods with no luck.  Then I looked on-line, and there were some suggestions of trying a local Brazilian grocery store, but then I saw some posts that mentioned I should be able to find it at Shaws in the frozen foods section where the Goya products are.  So I went back to Shaws, and lo and behold, there was frozen passion fruit pulp!  And when I went back to Harvest later on, I was able to find frozen guava pulp there!Now that I had all the ingredients and equipment I needed (I actually had to borrow a stand mixer from Susan because mine hadn't come in yet; thanks, Susan!), I had no more excuses, so I spent this past Saturday making these beauties.  Note:  this recipe does take quite a bit of time what with making the dough, letting it rise, then chilling it for 2 hours, then shaping and letting it rise again, then frying it, and finally filling the malasadas with the passion fruit curd.  But it's so, so worth it, especially if you don't live in Hawaii and can't just buy these at a local bakery whenever you want.  Also, I did make the guava coulis from the original recipe, but I thought the resulting coulis was way too watery, so I'm not including it here.  The malasadas were more than fine without it.Lilikoi Malasadas (from here)makes 50 donutsLilikoi Curd1 cup sugar1/2 cup butter1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice1/4 cup thawed lilikoi (passion fruit) pulp6 egg yolks, beatenIn a small saucepan, mix together the sugar, butter, lemon and lilikoi pulp; bring to a boil.In a small mixing bowl, whip the eggs yolks with 1/4 of the hot lilikoi mixture; pour the yolk mixture back to the saucepan.Simmer, uncovered, whisking continuously until thickened and starts to bubble. Do not allow the lilikoi curd to come to a to a full boil or the eggs will start curdling. Strain and chill.Malasadas3 cups bread flour1/4 cup sugar1 tablespoon + 1/2 teaspoon dry yeast7 eggs2 teaspoons salt1 1/2 cups butter, softened to room temperatureVegetable oil for deep fryingSugarIn a large bowl of an electric mixer use the dough hook to mix together the flour, sugar, and yeast.Mix in the eggs, one at a time to form a thick paste; continue to mix at medium speed for 15 more minutes, then add the salt. Add the softened butter, 1/2 cup at a time, while continuing to mix at medium speed.Transfer dough to a large bowl, cover, and allow to rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk.Refrigerate for 2 hours. Form the dough into 1-inch balls and allow it to rise once more at room temperature.Heat oil to 375°F. Fry the dough until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Roll in sugar.Fill the malasadas with the lilikoi curd using a pastry bag.The lilikoi curd is seriously one of the best things I have tasted in a long time.  It's tart and sweet and buttery and custardy all at the same time, and you just want to start spreading it on everything.  Then I tried a freshly fried malasada, and I knew the lilikoi curd had met its match.  The outside was crispy from the frying and crunchy from the granulated sugar while the inside was soft and chewy and slightly sweet.  I only wish I had been able to pipe in more of the lilikoi curd because the little squirt I got in there just wasn't enough."},
{"title": "Red Wine and Pear Sorbet", "date": "Tuesday, April 20, 2010", "text": "I made this a while ago before this blog was born and really liked it so when my stash of pears from Boston Organics started building up, I thought it was high time to make this again.  The original recipe from Martha Stewart has directions for how to make this without an ice cream maker, but seeing as how I have one, it seemed silly not to use it.Red Wine and Pear Sorbet (adapted from Everyday Food)makes about 1 quart1 cup dry red wine3/4 cup sugar1 pound ripe pears, peeled, cored, and cut into 1-inch pieces (2 cups)2 tablespoons fresh lemon juiceCoarse saltIn a medium saucepan, bring wine, 1 1/4 cups water, and sugar to a boil over medium heat, stirring often, until sugar dissolves. Add pears; reduce heat, and simmer until tender.Stir in lemon juice and a pinch of salt; cool completely.  Transfer to a blender or use an immersion blender to puree the mixture.  Chill thoroughly in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight.Once chilled, churn in your ice cream machine according to the manufacturer's directions.  Transfer to a container, cover, and freeze overnight or for several hours to harden.Although the original recipe said it would only take 5-10 minutes, I ended up having to cook the pears for over 20 minutes before they were tender.  This may have been because I used one Bartlett pear and one green pear instead of just Bartlett pears like the original recipe said.  Because I was cooking the mixture for that long, I figured I would have boiled off most of the alcohol, but there was still enough left to make this a pretty soft sorbet.  It's also kind of gritty in the way that pears are naturally gritty.  Not a bad thing, but if you don't like the texture of pears, you might want to pass on this recipe.  But if you like poached pears, you definitely need to try this out.  It tastes elegant and sophisticated, like something that should be served in a goblet vs. a normal dessert bowl.  I would totally serve this as a palate cleanser or at the end of a heavy dinner of say, steak."},
{"title": "Alphabet and Rosemary Cheddar Crackers", "date": "Thursday, April 8, 2010", "text": "I love Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers, so when I saw this post on how to make your own, I was really excited to try it out.  I don't have any teeny, tiny goldfish cookie cutters, but I do have rather small alphabet fondant cutters, so I thought it'd be fun to make alphabet crackers.I'm used to the bright orange color of the original crackers, so I wanted to find some bright orange cheese to use, but I couldn't find any.  So I tried the next best thing and added some yellow food coloring to half the dough since I don't have any orange food coloring, and didn't want to end up with a peach color like I did the last time I tried mixing red and yellow.  But the dough was too stiff coming out of the fridge, and I didn't have the patience (or the daylight left) to knead it through properly, so it ended up looking kind of marbled.  Which is fine because you can't even tell in the finished product, and ironically enough, the non-yellowed crackers turned out more orange-ish!While the dough was chilling overnight in the fridge, I remembered that I still had some fresh rosemary left from making the duck fat French fries and thought it'd be nice to add some to the cheese cracker dough.  So I added some rosemary leaves to the other half of the dough (after all, rosemary cheddar crackers are for adults and don't need artificial food coloring).Rosemary Cheddar Crackers (adapted from Ellie's Home Cooking)makes about 1 quart of crackers1/2 cup all-purpose flour1/2 cup white whole wheat flour3/4 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon ground pepper (optional) 4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces8 ounces shredded cheddar cheese1 tablespoon fresh rosemary leaves3-4 tablespoons waterPulse the flour, salt and pepper in a food processor, then add butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal.Add grated cheese a little at a time until the mixture again resembles coarse meal.Pulse in 3 to 4 tablespoons of water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough forms into a ball. It will probably take a minute or so.Remove from the food processor and knead in the rosemary.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for 20 minutes or up to 24 hours.Roll the dough out to 1/8th-inch thickness directly onto a baking sheet. You don't want to roll them paper thin, neither do you want to roll them too thick. If they are too thin, they will not puff up as much. If they are too thick, they will not be as crispy.Using a knife, pizza cutter, or cookie cutters, cut into desired shapes.Bake at 350° F for 15-20 minutes or until crackers are golden brown. Watch them after the 10 minute mark.I didn't roll the dough out as thin as I should have for some of the crackers, and they were definitely not as crispy as the thinner ones.  They did puff up so that they were almost cubical, though, so I threw them on top of a salad because as someone pointed out, they looked just like croutons.I don't think these tasted exactly like Goldfish crackers, but that's because they don't taste like something you can buy in a store.  Which is to say, these tasted like the fresh ingredients they were made out of.  I definitely preferred the rosemary crackers to the ones without; the herb added a nice aromatic, almost astringent note to the richness of crackers.  Next time I might try adding a bit of Tabasco sauce to the dough to add some heat.Lastly, you can make this using only all-purpose flour or only whole wheat flour.  I tried using half all-purpose and half white whole wheat and will probably try all whole wheat next time since it doesn't seem to make a huge difference."},
{"title": "Jean-Georges Vongerichten's Fried Rice", "date": "Wednesday, April 7, 2010", "text": "When I first saw this recipe on Bitten, I knew I had to make it the very next time I received leeks in my Boston Organics delivery.  Finally, my patience paid off.  This fried rice recipe is familiar in some ways--using day old rice and eggs--but quite novel in others.  There are no vegetables other than the leeks or any chopped, leftover meat.  Instead, minced fresh garlic and ginger are fried until crisp and then sprinkled on top to dress the rice along with a drizzling of sesame oil and soy sauce.  In the article, Mark Bittman writes that Jean-Georges uses rendered chicken fat; since I had duck fat leftover from making the duck fat fries, I used that instead.  Also, instead of using day-old cooked rice, I used rice that had been cooked a month ago and frozen in the freezer.  Whenever I have leftover cooked rice, I always divide it into first-sized portions and wrap them in plastic wrap and stick them in the freezer when they're still warm.  That way I can just heat it up in the microwave for a minute to thaw, and none of the moisture is lost.  Of course, after sitting in the freezer for a whole month, some of the moisture is lost, which makes it perfect to use for fried rice.Jean-Georges Vongerichten's Fried Rice (from Bitten)makes 2 servings1/4 cup duck fat1 tablespoon minced garlic1 tablespoon minced gingerKosher salt1 cup thinly sliced leeks, white and light green parts only, rinsed and dried2 cups day-old cooked rice, preferably jasmine, at room temperature2 large eggs1 teaspoon sesame oil2 teaspoons soy sauce In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons duck fat over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp and brown. With a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels and salt lightly.Reduce heat under skillet to medium-low and add 1 tablespoon duck fat and leeks. Cook about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until very tender but not browned. Season lightly with salt.Raise heat to medium and add rice. Cook, stirring well, until heated through. Season to taste with salt. In a nonstick skillet, fry eggs in remaining tablespoon of duck fat, sunny-side-up, until edges are set but yolk is still runny. Divide rice among two dishes. Top each with an egg and drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil and 1 teaspoon soy sauce. Sprinkle crisped garlic and ginger over everything and serve.I added a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds and chopped scallions on top as well just for a little more texture and color.  I was a little scared that the ginger might be too strong for my liking, but it was a lot more mild after frying, and the crunch it delivers is a real highlight to the dish.This recipe is truly inspired.  There are very few ingredients, but because each is an aromatic, and you keep using the same fat to cook the ginger, garlic, and leeks, you end up building a lot of flavor in the final dish.  At the same time, I finally know what they mean on Top Chef when they talk about simple, clean food.  Thank you, Jean-Georges and Mark, for sharing this recipe.  Now I really want to go to one of Vongerichten's restaurants.  Luckily, he's opened one in Boston, and it's also participating in Taste of the Nation Boston tomorrow!Next:  Alphabet and Rosemary Cheddar CrackersPreviously:  The Best Scones in the World"},

Ideally, we'd have glazed the blueberry scones with a lemon glaze, but there wasn't enough time.  According to one Family Ministry pastor, however, they were still super delicious.  =)We made the scones pretty small because  we wanted to be able to feed everyone, but you could definitely double  the size of these if you wanted larger scones.

{"title": "Apple Tarte Tatin", "date": "Monday, March 29, 2010", "text": "I had a couple of apples plus a lemon from the last Boston Organics delivery, so when I found a box of puff pastry in my freezer that I had forgotten about, I immediately thought of trying to make a tarte tatin.  I never took French, so I have no idea how to pronounce that, but it sure sounded good:  apples caramelized in butter and sugar, then topped with puff pastry and finished in the oven.I remembered Molly (of Orangette fame) had included a recipe for tarte tatin in her book, A Homemade Life, so I pretty much followed that version.  It wasn't until I went to copy and paste her version on-line that I realized the book version of the recipe didn't exactly mention that the puff pastry was supposed to be \"1/2 inch wider all around than the skillet\".  And you can see why below; the pastry shrinks as it bakes.  But I don't think it really matters all that much once you flip it over.  I also changed it up a bit by cutting the apples into sixteenths instead of quarters since I only had 4 apples.  And instead of placing them rounded side down, I made a spiral patter with the slices on their sides.Apple Tarte Tatin (based on Orangette's version here)makes 8 servings4 large apples, (I used Fuji)Juice of 1 lemon1 ½ cups granulated sugar6 tablespoons unsalted butter, dividedAbout 14 ounces puff pastryPeel and core the apples and cut each into 16 slices. Toss the apple slices in a large bowl with the lemon juice and ½ cup of the sugar. Set aside for 30 minutes.Melt 4 tablespoons of butter in a 9-inch oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining 1 cup sugar, along with a few tablespoons of the apple-lemon juices. Stir to mix. Cook the mixture over medium-low heat, stirring regularly with a wooden spoon, for about 15 minutes, or until the mixture is a smooth, bubbly, pale caramel color.Remove the pan from the heat and carefully add apple slices, arranging them neatly in a decorative pattern. Arrange a second layer of apples on top wherever they fit, closely packed. This second layer need not be terribly neat. Top the apples with the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, cut into dice.Preheat the oven to 375°F.Cook the apples over medium-low heat for about 20 minutes, occasionally spooning the bubbling caramel liquid over them. Press them down gently with the back of a spoon — don’t worry if they shift a bit in the liquid; just move them back to where they were — and watch to make sure that no one area of the pan is bubbling more than another. Shift the pan as necessary so that the apples cook evenly. They are ready when the liquid in the pan has turned to a thick, amber ooze. The apples should still be slightly firm. Do not allow them to get entirely soft or the liquid to turn dark brown. Remove the pan from the heat.On a floured surface, roll the puff pastry out to a thickness of about 3/16 inch. Using a sharp, thin knife, trace a circle in the pastry about 10 inches in diameter (1/2 inch wider all around than the skillet), and trim away any excess. Carefully lay the pastry circle over the apples in the skillet, tucking the overlap down between the apples and the inside of the pan.Place the skillet on a rimmed baking sheet, and bake for about 30-35 minutes, until the pastry has risen, and is dry and golden brown. Remove the skillet from the oven, and let it to rest for a minute or two. Tilt the pan and look down inside the edge: if there is a lot of juice, pour most of it off into the sink. [Do not pour it all off, or the apples may stick to the pan.] Place a serving platter upside-down over the skillet and, working quickly and carefully (it’s hot!), invert the tart onto the platter. Rearrange any apple slices that may have slipped or stuck to the skillet. Serve warm or at room temperature.Now if only I could figure out what to do with all the buttered apple juices I drained off....Next:  The Best Scones in the WorldPreviously:  Duck Fat French Fries with Rosemary, Maldon Salt, and Truffle Oil"},
{"title": "Duck Fat French Fries with Rosemary, Maldon Salt, and Truffle Oil", "date": "Thursday, March 25, 2010", "text": "...And back to the unhealthy.  (Although in my defense, I did try to make baked sweet potato fries the same day I made these, but they were just such a fail in comparison to these that I am ashamed to post about them.)When I first read about the cold fat method of making French fries on Bitten, I was ecstatic.  A way to make crispy fries without the splatter and smell of oil all over your kitchen?  Genius!  And then I thought, why not go all the way and really dress these fries up?  I had had the rosemary truffle fries at Garden at the Cellar recently, and really, really loved them, so I picked up some fresh rosemary and white truffle oil from Whole Foods.  (As another aside, did you know that most \"truffle oils\" on the market don't even contain real truffles?  If you look at the list of ingredients, it just says \"truffle flavoring\" or something like that, which is code for chemicals which have never seen a truffle before.  Unfortunately, I think there is only one brand of truffle oils in the U.S. that contain real truffles, and it wasn't available at Whole Foods.)I also had a box of Maldon salt I had picked up from Christina's Spices in Inman Square.  I'd rave about this salt myself, except it's already been done by so many people with so much more cooking cred than me.  Needless to say, this is pretty much one of the best finishing salts you can buy.  What I really love about this salt, other than the taste, is what a tactile experience it is to crush the flakes between your fingertips.And of course, I had duck fat.  Oh, how I love thee, duck fat.  Especially with potatoes.  (And don't forget, duck fat is better for you than butter!)I used the potatoes I had received in my Boston Organics delivery.  I'm not sure what exact kind they were, but they were relatively small and, I believe, from Prince Edward Island.Duck Fat French Fries with Rosemary, Maldon Salt, and Truffle Oil (method pretty much taken word for word from Bitten)Potatoes, peeledEnough fat to cover the cut potatoes (duck fat, peanut oil, etc., or any combination thereof)Fresh rosemaryMaldon saltTruffle oilCut your peeled potatoes into whatever shape you like, but probably no skinnier than three-eighths of an inch. Rinse them and shake off the water (part of the genius of this technique is that a little residual water won’t cause splattering, so you don’t need to towel-dry the potatoes). Put them in a heavy pan — a straight-sided sauté pan is ideal, but anything not too shallow will do. They should ideally be in a single layer, but this is not always practical: aim for it, though. Add room-temperature fat just to thoroughly cover and put the pan over low heat, without a lid.As the oil temperature slowly rises, the potatoes will, in effect, poach in fat and their excess water will gently evaporate (hence the lack of splattering). Yes, the oil will bubble, but reassuringly, not alarmingly. Every now and again, use a thin-bladed spatula or a long-handled spoon to make sure they are not sticking (their starch has a tendency to cause this) and give the pan a shake. Be very careful: at a certain point they will be very, very fragile — cooked but not yet crisp.When the potatoes are very tender, you can raise the heat, but only a little. Say, from low to medium-low. They will finally start to crisp and turn golden, and will ultimately become french fries. Excellent ones.  The one down side (apart from the limit on quantity) is that this can take as long as an hour.When your fries are starting to brown, throw in some of the fresh rosemary.  When your fries are sufficiently crisp and browned, remove fries and rosemary with a slotted spoon and drain.  Drizzle a little truffle oil on top.  Grab a pinch of Maldon salt and crush between your fingers to sprinkle on top.  Repeat to taste.I'm pretty sure you could make these French fries with regular oil instead of duck fat, with regular sea salt instead of Maldon salt, and without the rosemary and truffle oil, and they would still taste great.  I was kind of surprised by how non-greasy these were on the inside.  I figured that having the potatoes sit in fat for so long would've meant they would've been soaked in grease, but in actuality, they tasted more like a light and fluffy baked potato on the inside while staying nice and crispy on the outside.  In other words, perfection.Another thing I really like about this method of making French fries is that because the oil was kept at relatively low temperatures, the fats were not too damaged and you can save and reuse the fat for another French fry making session.  Which I'll probably be doing real soon....Next:  Apple Tarte TatinPreviously:  Lemon Angel Food CakeOne year ago:  Cincinnati Chili"},
{"title": "Lemon Angel Food Cupcakes", "date": "Monday, March 22, 2010", "text": "And now for something a little healthier.  After making two Crack Pies and the Guinness Milk Chocolate Ice Cream, I had a lot of egg whites sitting in my fridge.  I toyed briefly with the idea of making macarons, but then I remembered that no matter how cute and pretty they look, they are still ridiculously time-consuming to make, and I don't even really like how they taste all that much.  So instead, I decided to make angel food cake.  And since I had a lemon to use up from my Boston Organics delivery, I decided to make lemon angel food cupcakes.Just about every recipe for angel food cake lists cake flour as an ingredient.  I already have unbleached all-purpose flour and white whole wheat flour in my pantry and really didn't feel like buying yet another type of flour.  But luckily, a quick google for \"cake flour substitute\" brought me to this page, where I learned that I could add a tablespoon of cornstarch to a 1/2 cup measuring cup and then level off with all-purpose flour to make the equivalent of a 1/2 cup of cake flour.I also don't have a sifter, either, but I just ended up using a fine-mesh metal sieve and two bowls to sift the flour and sugar together.  At first I thought I could get away with just whisking the two together, which is what I usually do when I need to sift flour, but I realized pretty quickly that the powdered sugar was not going to unclump from mere whisking.Oh, and I got to use my new lemon juicer for the first time!  It's so much faster and cleaner than the reamer I've been using, and it was on sale too!  Don't forget to roll the lemon around on a hard surface before cutting so that you can get more juice out of it.Lemon Angel Food Cupcakes (based on this recipe from Cooking Light)makes 16 cupcakes1/2 cup cake flour (or 1 tablespoon corn starch plus 7 tablespoons all-purpose flour)3/4 cup powdered sugar3/4 cup egg whites (about 5 large eggs)1/8 teaspoon salt3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar1/2 cup granulated sugar1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractGrated rind from 1 medium lemon1/4 cup butter, softened2 cups powdered sugarFreshly squeezed lemon juice from 1 medium lemonPreheat oven to 350°F.  Place 16 paper muffin cup liners in muffin cups. Set aside.Lightly spoon cake flour into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Sift together flour and 3/4 cup powdered sugar into a medium bowl; repeat the procedure 2 times.Beat egg whites and salt with a mixer at high speed until frothy (about 1 minute). Add cream of tartar, and beat until soft peaks form. Add 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff peaks form. Sprinkle flour mixture over egg white mixture, 1/4 cup at a time; fold in after each addition. Stir in vanilla and rind.Divide batter evenly among prepared muffin cups. Bake at 350° for 18 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from pan; let cool completely on a wire rack.To prepare frosting, beat butter with a mixer at high speed until fluffy. Gradually add 2 cups powdered sugar; beat at low speed just until blended. Add lemon juice; beat until fluffy. Spread lemon frosting over each cupcake.Since I only have one muffin tin, I had to bake these in two batches, which meant I wasn't entirely sure how far to fill the muffin cups.  I erred on the side of caution for the first batch and only filled them 3/4 of the way.  They do rise in the oven, but then they shrink quite a bit once they cool, both in height and circumference.  Don't be surprised if the cupcakes don't stay entirely round after they've cooled.  So for the second batch I filled the cups with batter basically all the way to the top and was much more pleased with how those turned out after they had cooled.I found that I could eat one of these cupcakes in about two bites; they were so soft and delicious!  Actually, the texture really reminds me of the cake layer of lemon pudding cakes.  And the frosting--when I first tasted it straight from the bowl, I wasn't that impressed with the taste or texture, but once it's on the cupcakes--is so mouth-watering good!  It really reminded me of those lemon Girl Scout cookies or lemon coolers.Next:  Duck Fat French Fries with Rosemary, Maldon Salt, and Truffle OilPreviously:  Mama Huang's Secret Beer Duck Recipe"},

It's a really easy recipe that only uses 5 ingredients (6, if you count water) and produces a really tender, super-flavorful duck.  Best of all, you can harvest the duck fat at the end and the resulting drippings can totally be re-used for other recipes like xiao long bao.

{"title": "Guinness Milk Chocolate Ice Cream", "date": "Wednesday, March 17, 2010", "text": "I wanted to make a special ice cream for St. Patrick's Day, but couldn't decide between Guinness Milk Chocolate ice cream or Baileys Irish Cream ice cream, so I took a poll on Facebook.  I got 4 votes for Guinness, 8 votes for Baileys, 3 votes for both, and 1 vote for corned beef and cabbage ice cream.  Thanks, Ed.  =P  It was pretty interesting that all the guys (except for Ed) voted for the Guinness, and all the women, except for one, voted for the Baileys.I ended up making the Guinness Milk Chocolate ice cream because it only needed 4 egg yolks, vs. the 6 needed for the Baileys, and also because I needed to buy some beer to make my mom's beer duck.  And also because I was just curious about what Guinness Milk Chocolate ice cream would taste like (I'd already had the Häagen-Dazs version of Baileys).Guinness Milk Chocolate Ice Cream (from David Lebovitz's The Perfect Scoop, via flamingobear)makes about one quart7 ounces milk chocolate, finely chopped1 cup whole milk½ cup sugarPinch of coarse salt4 large egg yolks1 cup heavy cream¾ cup Guinness (I used Guinness Draught)1 teaspoon vanilla extract Put the chocolate pieces in a large bowl and set a mesh strainer over the top.Heat the milk, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan until hot and steamy. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks. Temper the yolks by slowly and gradually pouring in the warm milk mixture. Whisk constantly so that you don’t scramble the eggs. Then scrape the warmed egg yolk mixture back into the saucepan.Stir the mixture constantly over medium heat with a heatproof spatula, scraping the bottom as you stir, until the mixture thickens and coats the spatula (which will be at about 170-175°F on an instant-read thermometer). Pour the custard through the strainer over the milk chocolate, then stir until the chocolate is melted. Once the mixture is smooth, whisk in the cream, then the Guinness and vanilla. Stir until cool over an ice bath.Chill the mixture in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight – until the mixture is 40°F. Then freeze it in your ice cream maker. This ice cream is very soft coming out of the ice cream maker. It hardens somewhat in the freezer but maintains an almost soft-serve consistency due to the alcohol content. It melts quickly, so eat fast!So let me first say that I'm not really a big fan of the taste of beer or milk chocolate.  I was hoping that the two flavors together would meld into something that's greater than the sum of its parts, but in the end, what I taste is beer and milk chocolate.  I think I was trying to taste the beer, though, so its sharpness was very apparent to me.  I bet if you like the taste of beer and milk chocolate, you'd love this ice cream.Then I had the brilliant idea of adding some Baileys on top, just to see how that would taste.  And let me tell you, that totally transported me away to this little green island to the west of England where leprechauns roam and rainbows end with pots of gold.  This, my friends, was pure awesomeness.  I think next year, I might try to make both the Guinness Milk Chocolate ice cream and the Baileys Irish Cream ice cream and swirl them together to make an Irish Car Bomb ice cream.  But for this year, I'll just keep enjoying my Irish Car Bomb Sundae.  ;) Next:  Mama Huang's Secret Beer Duck Recipe Previously:  Momofuku's Crack Pie"},

Even though it was one of the most delicious things I had ever tasted, and I pretty much had all the ingredients for it already, I still told myself, \"Self, you can not make this pie.\"  Because you see, I'm trying to eat healthier.  After the last two posts, I figured it was time to start posting something healthier.  But then, I realized, Pi Day is coming up.  And I have a birthday party and a potluck dinner to go to.  And this recipe is for two pies.  And well, when the stars align....This is not an quick and easy recipe to make.  Before you even get to making the filling or even the crust, first you have to make the cookies that go into the crust.  But it's so worth it.  This pie?  Costs $44 at Momofuku Milk Bar.  Forty-four bucks!  And that's not including the shipping and handling if you don't happen to live in NYC.  So do yourself a favor and just make it yourself.Momofuku's Crack Pie (from the LA Times)Makes 2 pies (6 to 8 servings each)Cookie for crust2/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon (3 ounces) flourScant 1/8 teaspoon baking powderScant 1/8 teaspoon baking soda1/4 teaspoon salt1/2 cup (1 stick) softened butter1/3 cup (2 1/2 ounces) light brown sugar3 tablespoons (1 1/4 ounces) sugar1 eggScant 1 cup (3 1/2 ounces) rolled oatsHeat the oven to 375° F.In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.In a large bowl using an electric mixer, beat the butter, brown sugar and sugar until light and fluffy.Whisk the egg into the butter mixture until fully incorporated.With the mixer running, beat in the flour mixture, a little at a time, until fully combined. Stir in the oats until incorporated.Spread the mixture onto a 9-inch-by-13-inch baking sheet and bake until golden brown and set, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to the touch on a rack. Crumble the cooled cookie to use in the crust.CrustCrumbled cookie for crust1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter1 1/2 tablespoons (3/4 ounce) brown sugar1/8 teaspoon saltCombine the crumbled cookie, butter, brown sugar and salt in a food processor and pulse until evenly combined and blended (a little of the mixture clumped between your fingers should hold together). Divide the crust between 2 (10-inch) pie tins. Press the crust into each shell to form a thin, even layer along the bottom and sides of the tins. Set the prepared crusts aside while you prepare the filling.Filling1 1/2 cups (10 1/2 ounces) sugar3/4 cup plus a scant 3 tablespoons (7 ounces) light brown sugar1/4 teaspoon salt1/3 cup plus 1 teaspoon (3/4 ounce) milk powder1 cup (2 sticks) butter, melted3/4 cup plus a scant 2 tablespoons heavy cream1 teaspoon vanilla extract8 egg yolks2 prepared crustsPowdered sugar, garnishHeat the oven to 350° F.In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, brown sugar, salt and milk powder. Whisk in the melted butter, then whisk in the heavy cream and vanilla.Gently whisk in the egg yolks, being careful not to add too much air.Divide the filling evenly between the 2 prepared pie shells.Bake the pies, one at a time, for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 325° F and bake until the filling is slightly jiggly and golden brown (similar to a pecan pie), about 10 minutes. Remove the pies and cool on a rack.Refrigerate the cooled pies until well chilled. The pies are meant to be served cold, and the filling will be gooey. Dust with powdered sugar before serving.I actually made all the cookies (enough for two pies) but made each pie separately on separate days since I only have one pie pan.  Because the volumetric measurements are kind of hard to divide in half, I ended up weighing the ingredients that had weights listed for them.  From what I read on the interwebs, it seems like the toughest part about making this pie is figuring out how much time to bake it for and at what temperatures.  I pretty much just followed the LA Times guidelines and baked it for 15 minutes at 350° F, reduced the heat to 325° F, and continued baking for another 20 minutes.  At this point it was still \"slightly jiggly and golden brown\".It really is important to chill this pie.  I ended up cutting out a slice because I wanted to try to take a picture of it while I still had daylight.  The pie was still just a little above room temperature, and not completely solid yet.  I did take a bite at that point and thought it just tasted okay.  When I tried it later after it had been thoroughly chilled in the fridge, it was much, much better.  The texture had condensed, and the flavors just gelled better as well.I had toyed with the idea of substituting store-bought oatmeal cookies for the crust to save some time, but ultimately, I'm glad I didn't. The filling itself is so sweet that you need the crust to be more of a blank canvas rather than try to compete.  A lot of people at the party described this as tasting like \"pecan pie without the pecans\".  I bet this would be even better if there was a sprinkle of sea salt on top, and I'd be really curious if this could be lemon-ized so it was kind of like a lemon bar.  On crack. Next:  Guinnes Milk Chocolate Ice CreamPreviously:  Bacon Fat Caramels"},
{"title": "Bacon Fat Caramels", "date": "Monday, March 1, 2010", "text": "When I first read about Humphry Slocombe's lard caramels, my first thought was, why didn't they just use bacon fat instead of lard?  After all, candied bacon was all the rage already, and wouldn't bacon fat caramels sound so much more appetizing than lard caramels?  And for those of you who think bacon fat caramel sounds disgusting, well, we don't have to be friends anymore.  ;)So I made sure to save as much bacon fat as I could from the bacon I used for the bacon caramel corn.  I ended up with a little over 7 tablespoons of fat from about 10 oz. of uncooked bacon.  I searched on-line to see if anyone else had posted a recipe for bacon fat caramels, but the only one I found used sweetened condensed milk instead of cream.  I usually like sweetened condensed milk in my desserts, but it is a pretty strong flavor, and I really wanted the bacon flavor to shine through, so I ended up using a recipe for fleur de sel caramels and just replaced the butter with bacon fat.Bacon Fat Caramels (adapted from a recipe on Epicurious)makes about 40 candies1 cup heavy cream5 tablespoons bacon fat1 teaspoon kosher salt1 1/2 cups sugar1/4 cup light corn syrup1/4 cup waterLine bottom and sides of an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper, then lightly oil parchment. Bring cream, bacon fat, and salt to a boil in a small saucepan, then remove from heat and set aside. Boil sugar, corn syrup, and water in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Boil, without stirring but gently swirling pan, until mixture is a light golden caramel.Carefully stir in cream mixture (mixture will bubble up) and simmer, stirring frequently, until caramel registers 248°F on thermometer, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour into baking pan and cool 3 hours. Cut into 1-inch pieces, then wrap each piece in a 4-inch square of wax paper, twisting 2 ends to close.  Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.Optional:  Sprinkle diced, cooked bacon and/or sea salt on top of the caramel when it is still slightly soft.I actually didn't have any wax paper but found that wrapping the caramels in parchment paper worked fine.  The caramels were pretty greasy, but I think that was more because of the oil I used to grease the parchment rather than from the bacon fat itself.  I did notice that at room temperature, the caramels are really quite soft, so I would definitely keep these chilled until you serve them.As for the taste, some people have said it tastes like bacon drenched in maple syrup.  Others have said that they didn't even taste the bacon until they bit into the part that had a bit of diced bacon in it.  I did prefer the pieces that I sprinkled sea salt (I used Maldon sea salt) on more than the pieces that just had diced bacon because I think the texture worked better with the sea salt.  Although, I did press all the fat out of the diced bacon, so maybe if they weren't so dry, it would have worked better.Oh, and since I had two leftover butter wrappers after making the bacon caramel corn, I cut them up to wrap some of the caramels.  I kind of like how they look, even though it's false advertising. Next:   Momofuku's Crack PiePreviously:  Caramel Bacon Corn"},

When I saw that Boston Organics was offering organic popcorn as an add-on, I thought, \"Ooh!  I love popcorn; I should order some!\"  And then once I received it, I thought, I could use my air popper (thanks, Susan, I'm still using it after all these years!) to pop this.  But then the evil food fairy that sits on my left shoulder said, \"Yes, you could, but what's the unhealthiest thing you could do with this?\"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you bacon caramel corn.With all the hoopla over bacon the past couple of years, I figured (correctly) that I couldn't have been the first person to come up with the idea and googled for a recipe.  I used the one I found on bunrab.com, and the only changes I made were omitting the almonds, using a cup of light brown sugar and a cup of dark brown sugar instead of 2 cups of golden brown sugar, and popping the popcorn in bacon fat, just because I had some and wanted to see what popcorn popped in bacon fat tasted like.Bacon Caramel Corn (based on bunrab's recipe)makes 3 pints1/2 pound bacon1/3 cup organic popcorn kernels*1 cup butter2 cups brown sugar (I used 1 cup light and 1 cup dark just because)1/2 cup light corn syrup2 teaspoons kosher salt1 teaspoon baking sodaCut bacon into a fine dice and fry until crisp.  Reserve 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat.Heat the bacon fat in a large pot with a cover.  Add 3 popcorn kernels and cover.  Listen for all three kernels to pop, and add the rest of the popcorn kernels.  Cover and shake until popping stops.  Put popped corn in a non-stick roasting pan, making sure to remove the unpopped kernels.Preheat oven to 200°F.Heat butter, brown sugar, corn syrup and salt in a saucepan over medium high heat until it reaches 300°F on your candy thermometer.Remove from heat, stir in baking soda and bacon (the caramel will explode in volume at this point so make sure you use a large enough saucepan) and pour this caramel mixture over the popcorn (do this quickly so that the caramel doesn’t cool and stiffen).Stir the mixture with a couple wooden spoons and place in the oven for a total of an hour rearranging the popcorn to evenly distribute the caramel and bacon every 15 minutes. Add more salt (if necessary) during this process. Cool and break into bite-sized pieces.*Popping 1/3 cup of organic popcorn kernels gave me ~6 cups popped corn plus quite a few unpopped kernels.  I'd guess if you are using a gourmet popping corn you may need to use less than 1/3 cup of kernels to get 6 cups of popped corn, which is the amount you need for this recipe.So I tried some of the bacon fat-popped corn before dousing it with the caramel, and while I could taste a whiff of bacon, I personally think butter pairs better with popcorn.  Bacon and caramel, however, pair together wonderfully (a fact which I will devote the next post to).  Do I really need to describe how awesome bacon, caramel, and popcorn taste together?  It's so good I had to hide this from some of my vegetarian friends for fear they'd give up their convictions just to try some.  See what a good friend I am?Next:  Bacon Fat CaramelsPreviously:   Faux Momofuku Brussels Sprouts"},
{"title": "Faux Momofuku Brussels Sprouts", "date": "Monday, February 22, 2010", "text": "I remember when I was growing up in elementary school, one of the two vegetables most hated by my peers (the other being lima beans) were brussels sprouts.  Because of that, I never even tried a brussels sprout (or a lima bean for that matter) until much later in life, probably college.  I do remember after trying my first brussels sprout thinking that they were absolutely delicious and so extremely cute, like a baby cabbage.<Aside> The vegetable I truly detested in elementary school were green beans.  I couldn't stand the smell of them when they were being served in the school cafeteria.  I still don't really like them this day, but I can handle them when they're cooked fresh Asian style (stir-fried with garlic) or smothered with the sodium-bearing medium that is cream of mushroom.  </Aside>I'm lucky enough to get to go to Manhattan for work every month or two but I'm too chicken to go downtown by myself since I usually stay uptown.  So when a co-worker and fellow foodie joined me on my last trip, I told her in no uncertain terms that we were going to go to a Momofuku for dinner.  I've been wanting to try the steamed pork buns forever!  After a bit of research, I decided to go to the Momofuku Ssam Bar because the Momofuku Bakery and Milk Bar was just next door, and I also wanted to try the chess pie and cereal milk.After all the hype about the steamed pork buns, it's probably not that surprising that I wasn't totally blown away by them, but I most certainly was a huge fan of the fried brussels sprouts.  They were served with a mint and fish sauce dressing and topped with these crunchy, seasoned pieces of puffed rice, like Rice Krisipies.  As soon as I got home, I had to google for the recipe to see if I could try to recreate the dish.  Luckily, there was a version on Epicurious that roasted the sprouts instead of deep frying them, since I dislike deep frying at home.  (And I totally missed the fact that those brussels sprouts had been deep fried!)I decided to skip the whole puffed rice bit so simplicity's sake.  And while the mint in the original version added a very interesting note to the sauce, but I didn't really feel like buying some just for this recipe, and the same goes for the cilantro stems and Thai chiles.  Plus, I still very much dislike cilantro.  So I simplified the recipe even more by making the dressing with just the fish sauce, sugar, water, and garlic.  Oh, and instead of roasting the sprouts in oil and then tossing them with butter, I just roasted them in duck fat because I had some on hand.  And it's okay if the leaves start coming off of the sprouts when you're halving them.  Throw them in along with everything else because they'll get really nice and crispy and totally be first thing you'll want to pop in your mouth when these come out of the oven.Faux Momofuku Brussels Sprouts (very much inspired by David Chang's recipe on Epicurious)makes enough for two as a side, or one hungry girl1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved lengthwise2 tablespoons duck fat, melted (or regular canola oil)1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce1 tablespoon water1 tablespoon sugar1/4 tablespoon minced garlicPreheat oven to 450°F with a rack in the upper third of the oven. Trim and halve the Brussels sprouts, toss with oil, and roast, cut side down on baking sheet, for 20-35 minutes, depending on size and desired taste. They should brown but remain somewhat firm.Meanwhile, stir together the rest of the ingredients in a small bowl.  Heat in the microwave for a minute to dissolve the sugar. When sprouts are done, transfer to a serving bowl and add just enough dressing to coat.That's it!  You won't believe the depth of flavor you'll get from so few ingredients.  They were so good I just kept eating them with my hands instead of taking the time to get a fork.  The only downside to this is that the fish sauce can be quite stinky, especially if you're just smelling it and not eating any so you don't get the oral context for what your nose is telling you (kind of like how dumplings can be smelly if you're not the one eating them; a fact which I was unaware of for most of my life because I was usually the one eating them!).Honestly, I think I might have liked these better than the Momofuku version because the mint in the original kept jumping out and saying, \"Here I am!  I am mint!\"  And nobody likes to be interrupted when eating something this yummy."},

I first heard about Nutella in high school when one of my friends came back from a trip to Europe and told me about this amazing chocolately spread that they had on bread almost every day.  But I don't think it was until college that I finally got to try it when I saw it for the first time at Wegmans.  Ah, Wegmans.  Where every good thing comes from.  Kinda like God.  ^_^This Nutella ice cream was one of the first ice creams I made when I got my ice cream maker.  In fact, it may be the reason I got an ice cream maker in the first place.  It has two ingredients.  Two!  Can you tell I like the simple recipes?  Or rather, I like recipes with high yumminess to number of ingredients ratios.  On a scale of one to ten, this one scores about a thousand in my book.Nutella Ice Cream (from Chocolate and Zucchini)makes about 3/4 quart350 grams (1 1/2 cups) Nutella410 grams (1 1/2 cups + 1 tablespoon) evaporated milk Pre-freeze the bowl of your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions. Combine the Nutella and evaporated milk in a medium mixing bowl, and stir with a whisk until they become one, voluptuous and smooth. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled. Whisk again and churn in your ice cream maker.Transfer to a container, cover, and freeze overnight or for several hours to harden.I made a batch for a small party I hosted, thinking I'd have leftovers that I could use to take pictures of the next morning when I had sunlight.  Yeah, that didn't happen.  This stuff was gone before I could save any.  So all I have are the pictures of when it was churning.  But if you look at the blurry part of the ice cream (and not the lumpy, grainy part), you'll get an idea of how it tastes.  It is smooth and voluptuous, just like Clotilde described.  Other words I'd use to describe it are luscious and velvety.  In fact, it's almost chewy, like Turkish ice cream.  And since the only two ingredients are Nutella and evaporated milk, it tastes just like Nutella:  rich cocoa and fragrant hazelnuts.  The only thing is, it's so sweet, I might add even a little more evaporated milk next time.  Clotilde's solution was to use an all-natural, organic hazelnut-cocoa spread.  Anyone know where I can get some in Boston?  Unfortunately, it may take a couple of more years before a Wegmans comes to Massachusetts....p.s.  For those who don't have an ice cream maker, Clotilde does explain how you can make this without one, although it's pretty labor intensive."},

I filled them up about three-quarters of the way, and they didn't rise too much after baking.Like magic, the batter separated into a dense lemony custard at the bottom of the dish and a light, fluffy sponge cake at the top.  You can serve them either in the cups or unmold them so that the custard is on top.Lemon Pudding Cakes (from Baking Bites)makes 3 individual servings1 egg, separated2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon lemon zest1/3 cup milk 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract1/2 cup sugar1/4 cup all-purpose flourPinch of saltPreheat oven to 350°F.

Stir egg whites gently into lemon mixture, until well combined.Pour mixture into prepared souffle dish and gently place in water bath.Bake for 30-40 minutes, until the cake has risen and begun to pull away from the sides of the dish.This was so good, I ended up making another batch the next time I got a lemon from Boston Organics!  I couldn't believe how good this tasted considering no oil is added, and the only fat comes from the egg.  I did end up saving one overnight in the fridge, and it tasted just as good the next day, even when I ate it cold.

{"title": "Pear Bread", "date": "Tuesday, January 26, 2010", "text": "Faced with a surfeit of pears from Boston Organics, I decided to make Smitten Kitchen's Pear Bread.  I'd never eaten pear bread before, but after trying it, I'd describe it as banana bread, only without the bananas.  I don't taste the pears at all, but the fruit does add a lot of moistness to the cake along with just the tiniest bit of the gritty pear texture.  I actually substituted 1/2 cup of the all-purpose flour with 1/2 cup of white whole wheat flour since I'm trying to use up the sack I bought by accident.Pear Bread (from Smitten Kitchen)makes 2 loaves or one tube cake3 cups all-purpose flour1 teaspoon baking soda1/4 teaspoon baking powder1 teaspoon salt1 tablespoon ground cinnamon1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)3/4 cup vegetable oil3 eggs, lightly beaten2 cups sugar2 to 4 pears firm, ripe pears, depending on size (you’ll need 2 grated cups total, but don’t grate them until you are about to use them so that they don’t brown)2 teaspoons vanilla extractHeat your oven to 350°F and lightly grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan or two 9-by-5-inch loaf pans.Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a large mixing bowl, and stir with a fork to mix everything well. If you’re using nuts, scoop out about 1/4 cup of the flour mixture and combine it in a small bowl with the chopped walnuts, stirring and tossing to coat the nuts with the flour.Peel and core pears, then grate them. You’ll want two grated cups total; set them briefly aside. In a medium bowl, combine the butter or oil, eggs, sugar, grated pear, nuts (if using), and vanilla, and stir to mix everything well. Scrape the pear mixture into the flour mixture and stir just until the flour disappears and the batter is evenly moistened.Quickly scrape the batter into the prepared pans and bake at 350°F for 60 to 70 minutes, or until the bread is handsomely browned and firm on top and a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.I ended up not adding the sprinkle of confectioner's sugar or glaze that Deb suggests because it was sweet enough as is.  It's also pretty crumbly, so I didn't want to have to deal with another potential factor for messiness.  I think if I were to make this again, I might add some chocolate chips to it (giving them the same flour coating treatment as the nuts so that they don't sink).  Deb says in her post that the bread got better day after day.  I'm not sure if I'd agree, although it certainly doesn't get worse.  I'd say that it remains a good, homey slice of comfort.  And if I wanted to be super decadent, I'd toast this and spread some honey butter on top.Edited to Add (on 1/26/10):  I take back what I said about this bread not getting better.  I just had some for breakfast 3 days after I baked it, and I don't know what happened between yesterday and today, but it is definitely better today.  It seems like the baking soda and salt are standing out a bit more leaving this tang on my tongue that demands more pear bread.  I can't stop eating it!One year ago:  Luo Buo Gao (Chinese Turnip Cake)"},
{"title": "Sweet Potato Gnocchi with Maple Cinnamon Sage Brown Butter", "date": "Friday, January 22, 2010", "text": "I had two sweet potatoes left from my Boston Organics delivery, so I decided to try to make sweet potato gnocchi.  The only other time I had ever made gnocchi was when I made the ricotta gnocchi for the Daring Cooks challenge back in May.  That was definitely a pretty complicated recipe, but the sweet potato gnocchi recipe in Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything was a lot simpler.That recipe didn't mention what sauce to pair with the gnocchi, though, so I turned to Google for some inspiration.  The first hit for a search for \"sweet potato gnocchi\" was Giada's \"Sweet Potato Gnocchi with Maple Cinnamon Sage Brown Butter\".  Can you say yum?Sweet Potato Gnocchi with Maple Cinnamon Sage Brown Butter (based on Mark Bittman's recipe in How to Cook Everything and Giada De Laurentiis' recipe here)makes 3-4 servings1 lb. sweet potatoes (about 2)Salt and pepper1 cup all-purpose flour1/4 cup butter15 fresh sage leaves2 teaspoons maple syrup1/2 teaspoon cinnamon1 dash nutmegStart boiling a pot of water.Peel the sweet potatoes and cut into small 1\" chunks.  Place in a microwaveable bowl with a little water and cover.  Microwave for five minutes or until the sweet potatoes are done.  Drain, season with salt and pepper, and mash with a fork.Add about a half cup of the flour and stir.  Continue adding the flour in small increments until you get a dough that you can handle.  You want to add as little flour as possible to keep the gnocchi from being too dense.  Pinch off a small piece and drop into boiling water to make sure it will keep its shape.Place the dough onto a floured counter top (or cutting board).  Divide in half and roll each piece into a 1/2 inch wide snake.  Cut the dough into 1 inch long pieces and roll over the tines of a fork.  Place shaped pieces onto a floured plate without them touching one another.Cook the gnocchi in the boiling water in batches.  You don't want there to be more gnocchi in the pot than can cover the surface of the water.  The gnocchi is done about a minute after it starts floating.While the gnocchi is cooking, melt the butter in a separate small saucepan.  Once it is melted, add the sage leaves and continue to cook until the milk solids in the butter have browned.  Remove from heat and add the maple syrup, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt to taste.Toss the cooked gnocchi with the browned butter sauce and serve hot.Leftovers can be refrigerated and pan-fried the next day for a slightly different texture.I found dough could be quite sticky and gluey before I finally added enough flour for it to be workable.  In hindsight, I probably should have drained the potatoes better before adding the dough.  While this gnocchi was considerably heavier than the ricotta gnocchi I had made before, it was still a lot lighter than say, the big, thick Shanghainese and Korean rice cakes.  The gnocchi itself didn't have much flavor, but the brown butter sauce more than made up for that.  I really liked how the sage and maple syrup brought out the flavor of the sweet potatoes.  What kind of surprised me was that I actually wanted to add a little more black pepper to this dish even though I normally don't really like black pepper. I had some leftovers, which I pan-fried in the butter sauce (no additional oil needs to be added), although I removed most of the sage first and added it back in when the gnocchi was almost done so that it didn't burn.  While I did like the light crispiness the pan-frying added to the gnocchi, I think it was better overall when it was fresh.One year ago:  Scallion Pancakes"},
{"title": "Kalua Pork", "date": "Tuesday, January 19, 2010", "text": "Nope, that's not a typo.  This isn't pork made with Kahlua.  This is kalua pork, the Hawaiian roasted pork served at luaus.  Traditionally, a whole salted pig is put into a pit filled with hot rocks and banana leaves and covered so that it can cook all day.  I got to go to Hawaii years and years ago for a family reunion (relatives from Taiwan and the US met halfway) and still remember loving this dish.  The pork was moist, fall-off-the-bone tender, and had a depth of flavor that I thought could only be delivered via cooking in a pit for hours and hours.Luckily for those of us who don't have easy access to whole pigs, pits, hot rocks, and banana leaves, you can make kalua pork in a slow cooker with only 2 ingredients:  pork butt and smoked salt!  The first you can get from almost any grocery store; just make sure it'll fit into your slow cooker.  Apparently, pork butt is actually the same thing as pork shoulder, so either would work.I found smoked Hawaiian sea salt at Narrin's Spice and Salt in Cleveland's West Side Market.  I had actually bought this a couple of years ago but never figured out what to use it in until now.  This particular product has a blend of Hawaiian black and pink salt along with regular white sea salt.  If you can't find smoked sea salt, you can also use liquid smoke with regular sea salt.Kalua Porkmakes about 6 servings2.5 lbs. pork butt (or shoulder)2 tablespoons smoked Hawaiian sea saltUsing a steak knife, poke the pork all over and then rub the salt all over.Place the pork in a slow cooker and cook on low for 20 hours, turning once halfway through.  Pork is done when it can be easily shredded with a fork.That's it!  With only two ingredients and two lines of instructions, you'll be surprised how flavorful the finished product is.  During the slow cooking process, all the fat starts to render out of the meat so that at the end, it's cooking in its own juices, a sort of pork confit if you will.  While I wouldn't consider the top half of the meat (that isn't sitting in the juices) to be dry, it is drier and less salty than the bottom half.  I tried to turn the meat again when it was done to try to even it out, but the pork was so tender, I wasn't sure I could get it flipped without totally mangling it.  If I had had more time, I would've shredded all the meat and served it with the reserved juices on the side for people to add if they wanted.  Instead, I just brought the whole thing to a potluck and served it with some shredded cabbage sauteed with garlic and rice, letting people shred off as much as they wanted.One year ago:  Mayonnaise Shrimp with Candied Walnuts, Char Siu Bao"},
{"title": "Banana Bread Yeasted Waffles", "date": "Friday, January 15, 2010", "text": "When I was originally looking for yeasted waffle recipes, I stumbled across this one for Banana Bread Waffles.  I know, right?  What an awesomely yummy idea!  The more I thought about it, the more I was tempted to skip the waffle face off and just make these.  But ordinances must be followed, so I saved this one for last.  The only thing I changed was that I added some walnut pieces to the batter right before cooking since I had some lying around, and since I didn't have ground ginger or ground cloves, I added a pinch of allspice.  Oh, and I halved the original recipe since I only had 2 bananas.Banana Bread Yeasted Waffles (from seven spoons)makes 2-3 servings2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon milk1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract1 cup all-purpose flour1/2 tablespoon dark brown sugar, packed3/4 teaspoons yeast1/4 teaspoon salt1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon1/8 teaspoon ground nutmegPinch of allspice1 egg, beaten lightly1/2 cup mashed ripe banana, about 1 1/2 bananas1 tablespoon Greek yogurt1/4 cup walnut pieces (optional)In a small bowl, whisk together the butter, milk and vanilla. Set aside, the mixture should be warm but not hot.In a large mixing bowl, sift or whisk together the flour, brown sugar, yeast, salt and spices. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, whisking until smooth. Stir in the beaten eggs. Cover the bowl loosely and refrigerate for at least 12 hours, but up to 24.About 30 minutes before you want to make waffles, take the batter out of the refrigerator to come up to room temperature slightly. It should be doubled in size and the surface will be covered in bubbles.When ready to begin, stir the sour cream into the mashed bananas and then mix the fruit and walnuts (if using) into the batter. It will deflate, but use a light, quick hand to thoroughly combine. Heat your waffle iron and bake the waffles as per the manufacturer's instruction.Serve with maple syrup and additional slices of fresh bananas and walnuts, if desired.Leftovers can be frozen and then reheated in a toaster or in an oven; keep the heat low and an eye on them though, they brown quickly.I found that I needed more than 30 minutes at room temperature for the batter to double, so I stuck it in a slightly warm oven for 15 minutes.  In the end, I found these waffles to be more soft than crispy and the flavor wasn't very memorable.  In fact, right now I'm thinking that griddling a slice of real banana bread on a waffle iron might be even better....One year ago:  Nian Gao (Mochi Cake), Red Bean Ice Cream"},
{"title": "Gaufres de Liege (Belgian Waffles)", "date": "Wednesday, January 6, 2010", "text": "I know I had said I'd try to post something more colorful, but I fear that won't be happening anytime soon.  Because I have become obsessed with making waffles.  Even after deciding I liked The Waffle of Insane Greatness better than Mark Bittman's Overnight Waffles, which many people said were the best waffles ever, I decided to give yeasted waffles another chance.  Especially after I saw this post for \"The Best Waffle You'll Ever Eat:  Gaufres de Liege\" on The Kitchn in one of their end of the year roundups.  You can probably tell that I am quite influenced by hyperboles.I really was excited to find a recipe for a real Belgium waffle that used turbinado sugar instead of pearl sugar since it's ever so much easier to find turbinado sugar in Boston.  I didn't have any bread flour so I used regular all-purpose flour instead.  I can't tell you how much of a difference it made, but I definitely did end up with a dough more than a batter at the end.  The post mentions that any waffle iron should work as long as \"the pockets are fairly deep\".  I'm not sure my waffle iron falls into that category, but I didn't notice any uncooked portions so don't let that deter you.  Lastly, the recipe calls for the use of a stand mixer.  I don't have a stand mixer.  I'd love a stand mixer.  I will gladly accept a stand mixer.  But until then, I have a hand mixer, and that's what I used.  Since the recipe did mention that the dough would be quite stiff, I switched out the usual beaters I use for batters and used the special beaters that the manufacturers stated would work better for stiff doughs.  It worked, but I can definitely see why a stand mixer (or an extra hand) would have been ideal. Gaufres de Liege (from Chichi on The Kitchn)makes 12 small waffles6 tablespoons warm milk (no hotter than 110°F)1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar  2 teaspoons instant yeast1 1/2 cups (230 grams) bread flour, sifted (all-purpose flour seemed to work fine for me)1 teaspoons cinnamon2 teaspoons vanilla extract1/2 teaspoons salt1 medium egg1 egg yolk1/2 cup (4 oz) unsalted butter, at slightly cooler than room temperature140 grams turbinado sugar, or pearl sugar if you chooseCooking spray Dissolve the sugar in the warm milk; then add the yeast. Make sure that the milk is not too hot, lest it kill the yeast instead of promoting its growth. Place a plate or some kind of cover on top of the bowl with the milk, sugar and yeast. Set aside for about five minutes. When you check on it, the yeast should have bubbled up, looking light brown and spongy. Meanwhile, mix the sifted bread flour with the cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Pour in the yeast mixture; then add the whole egg and egg yolk. Mix on medium speed until it is fully combined. The dough will be yellow and stiff, yielding only slightly to a poke. Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest in a warm place for about thirty minutes.Beat in the butter piece by piece; you do not have to wait for the prior piece to be fully incorporated before adding the next. When the dough has incorporated about half of the butter, the mixture will be like a very thick, somewhat broken-up paste. If you keep engaging the mixer on medium-high speed, the dough will eventually become a cohesive whole, looking smoother and more feeling more elastic. Scrape the sides of the bowl if needed. Kneading very gently, incorporate the sugar crystals just enough to get them evenly distributed. Work quickly so as not to soften the buttery dough too much.Divide the dough into a dozen equal pieces, gently forming them into balls.Place the balls of dough on a cutting board in a warmish place for fifteen minutes or so. During the last two minutes of this resting time, preheat your waffle iron until it is very warm, but not hot. Spray the griddles with cooking oil. Place each ball of dough in a whole square or section of the waffle iron. Like regular waffle batter, the dough will start to puff up. Cook the waffles until the surface is golden to dark brown. Be sure that the waffle iron you are using is appropriately deep, or else the interior of the waffle will not be cooked through.Set the waffles on a cooling rack as they come out of the iron to promote a crispy exterior. Serve immediately with a sprinkling of powdered sugar. Any leftover waffles, if they are not dark brown, can be carefully re-cooked in a toaster for approximately thirty to sixty seconds. Leftover waffles may also be kept in an airtight container between sheets of parchment paper, for up to three days.My roommate declared these waffles better than the previous two.  Personally, I think they're a whole other species of waffle so it's hard to compare.  These seem more like cookies that I can eat with my hands rather than needing a plate, utensils, and maple syrup.  I found that they were sweet enough (and a whole heck of a lot cleaner) to eat without the powdered sugar.  The waffles didn't really seem to crisp up as much as get uniformly solid, but the turbinado sugar definitely kept its crunch and gave it a nice, fun texture.One year ago:   Buckeyes"},
{"title": "Creamy Delicata Squash Soup", "date": "Wednesday, December 30, 2009", "text": "And now with this entry I think my blog is officially almost monochrome.  I shall have to try to make more colorful recipes again soon.I needed to use up two more delicata squash that I received from Boston Organics and since it's been super cold lately, I googled for a soup recipe.  I came across this one on allrecipes.com, and while I usually only try the recipes on there that have several hundred reviews, it seemed straightforward enough to try.  I did make a couple of adjustments, however, since I didn't want to wait for the squash to fully cook via roasting.  In the comments someone said they had microwaved the squash instead, which shaved off at least a good half an hour.  The squash cooked unevenly so I ended up scooping out the done parts and re-microwaving the rest until it was done.And I substituted chicken broth for the vegetable broth and milk and half & half for the heavy cream (but only because I didn't have any).Creamy Delicata Squash Soup (adapted from here)makes 3-4 servings2 delicata squash, halved lengthwise and seeded1 small onion, chopped2 cups chicken broth1/3 cup half & half2/3 cup milk1 tablespoon olive oilSalt and pepper to taste1 dash nutmeg (optional)Place the squash cut side down in a microwave-safe baking dish.  Add 1/8\" water to the dish and microwave on high for 7 minutes or until squash is soft.In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil. Add onion and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally until onion is softened but not brown.Scrape the squash out of the flesh and add to onions. Add the broth, half & half, and milk. Bring to a boil and then simmer, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes.Puree the soup using an immersion blender.  Season with salt and pepper and a dash of nutmeg, if you like.Pureeing the soup made it really light and frothy.  The consistency was slightly grainy like a potato soup, but it really wasn't very thick at all.  I found that I barely had to add any salt to it, but then maybe that's because the chicken broth I used was already pretty salty.  I think the nutmeg really brought out the sweetness of the squash.  In fact, I can see this being a really versatile template for a squash soup.  You could go the sweeter path and really roast the squash with some butter and maybe a little brown sugar.  Or you could go the more savory route and use shallots instead of the onion and maybe throw in a little garlic or other fresh herbs.  All in all, it was the perfect thing to have on a frigid day.p.s. I made the croutons in the pictures by simply sauteeing some cubed wheat bread in butter.  If I had really been clever, I would've cut the croutons in the shape of the squash seeds.  =)ETA:  I recently made this and added curry powder instead of nutmeg.  It was delicious!One year ago:  Hua Juan (Steamed Scallion Buns)"},
{"title": "Homemade Waffle Face Off", "date": "Monday, December 28, 2009", "text": "Ever since I tried my first Belgian waffle (with real pearl sugar!) from Mr. Crepes a few weeks ago, I've been wanting to make some waffles.  My friend, Nicole, had left me her waffle maker when she moved away this past summer and I had yet to break it out.  I was hoping to buy some pearl sugar from Mr. Crepes, but it turns out they no longer sell it there.  So I settled for making regular waffles.  But oh my, the many different \"regular\" waffle recipes that existed!  I browsed through the waffles on TasteSpotting, The Kitchn, and looked up Alton Brown's recipe.  I remembered an episode from Good Eats when he explained that the batter you want for pancakes and the batter you want for waffles are two completely different things since pancakes should be soft and fluffy and waffles should be crispy on the outside.  Unfortunately, his recipe for the Basic Waffle included buttermilk as an ingredient, and I didn't really feel like buying something I don't usually use just to make this.  But then I found a recipe titled, \"Waffle of Insane Greatness\".  How could you not want to make those?And then while talking to my friend, Helena, about my plan to make waffles, she recommended Mark Bittman's recipe for Overnight Waffles from How to Cook Everything (thank you, Ellen!), saying they were the best waffles she had ever had.  That's when I decided it was time for another face off:  Yeasted vs. non-yeasted waffles.Obviously, as you can tell from the title, the Overnight Waffles need to be started the night before to give the yeast time to do it's thing.  There are several steps to the recipe, and I followed everything to the letter (including separating the egg and whipping up the egg whites; is there anything more satisfying than whipping egg whites up to a soft peak by hand?) except that I halved the recipe.  Hopefully it didn't alter the outcome too much.Overnight Waffles (based on Mark Bittman's recipe from How to Cook Everything)makes 2-3 servings1/4 teaspoon instant yeast1 cup all purpose flour1/2 tablespoon sugar1/4 teaspoon salt1 cup milk4 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled1/4 teaspoon vanillaCanola oil (for brushing on waffle iron)1 eggThe night before, combine dry ingredients and stir in the milk, then butter and vanilla.  The mixture will be loose and creamy.  Cover and set aside overnight at room temperature.The next morning, brush the waffle iron lightly with oil and preheat.  Separate the egg and stir the egg yolk into the batter.  Beat the egg whites until they hold soft peaks.  Fold them gently into the batter.Pour the batter onto the waffle iron just until the barely covered.  Bake 3 to 5 minutes, depending on your iron.  Serve immediately with maple syrup and butter.I thought it was interesting that in the book, Mark mentions that his favorite type of maple syrup is Grade B which is also the cheapest.  Maple syrup is pretty darn expensive even up here in New England, but I found that Harvest sells Grade B maple syrup in bulk!It looks like the \"Waffle of Insane Greatness\" recipe is from a restaurant called Aretha Frankenstein's in Tennessee.  I have a feeling I will never get to go and try the originals, but having the recipe is good enough for me.Waffle of Insane Greatness (courtesy of the Food Network and Aretha Frankenstein's)makes 4 servings3/4 cup all purpose flour1/4 cup cornstarch1/2 teaspoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon baking soda1/2 teaspoon salt1 cup milk1/3 cup vegetable oil1 egg1 1/2 teaspoons sugar3/4 teaspoon vanillaIn a medium bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; mix well.  Add the milk, vegetable oil, egg, sugar, and vanilla and mix well.  Let the batter sit for 30 minutes.Preheat the waffle iron.  Do not use non-stick spray on the waffle iron; the oil in the batter will allow the waffle to release easily.  Follow the directions on your waffle iron to cook the waffles.  Serve immediately with butter and syrup.It's true about not needing to grease the waffle iron for these.  If you let the batter sit long enough, the oil will even start to separate.  If that happens, just stir the batter again and the oil will re-incorporate.  I chose not to halve this recipe because it would've been a lot harder to do so and also because it seemed like the main ingredients (flour, milk, oil, and egg) were almost identical in quantity.As you can see from the pictures above, the Waffle of Insane Greatness browned more uniformly and had a more defined shape.  This translated into a crisper waffle.  It also had an eggier taste than the Overnight Waffles which I thought had a pretty strong yeasty taste.  The texture of the Overnight Waffles was definitely fluffier but I didn't really get the crispiness.I decided to try to make them side by side so that they had the same amount of time on the iron.  Again you can see (below) that the Waffle of Insane Greatness had a more defined shape and that the Overnight Waffles had more air bubbles, but now you can see that the Overnight Waffles actually brown quicker than the Waffle of Insane Greatness.  (Please ignore the fact that there are holes in the Waffle of Insane Greatness; that's more due to user error as you can see in the picture with the waffle iron.)Personally, I had a slight preference for the Waffle of Insane Greatness because it was able to get the crispy texture I wanted.  Too many air bubbles in the Overnight Waffles meant it absorbed the maple syrup like a sponge and got way too soggy way too fast.  Also, I thought the yeasty taste was a little too strong for me.  One of my roommates preferred the Overnight Waffles, though, and my other roommate's sister preferred the Waffle of Insane Greatness.As a final experiment, I mixed the last of both batters together and made an Overnight Waffle of Insane Greatness.  This turned out to be the perfect waffle for me.  The yeasty flavor was neutralized and turned into a more malted flavor.  The waffle was crispier and had less air bubbles than the Overnight Waffles but was fluffier than the regular Waffle of Insane Greatness.  If I ever really, really wanted to make the perfect waffle, I would make these two recipes and combine them again.  But being the lazy person I am, I'll probably just make the Waffles of Insane Greatness again and maybe try separating the egg and whipping up the egg whites before folding them in.One year ago:  Hot Pot, Tang Yuan"},
{"title": "Apple and Pear Cake FAIL", "date": "Friday, December 18, 2009", "text": "I needed to use up some more apples and pears from my Boston Organics delivery, so I decided to try Smitten Kitchen's Mom's Apple Cake.  Except I didn't have a tube pan.  Or a bundt pan.  And I only had 2 apples and 2 pears.  And I accidentally bought white whole wheat flour instead of my usual unbleached all-purpose flour.  A normal person might have decided these reasons were enough to stop, but oh no, I had to go ahead and try to make the cake anyways.First conversion:  I figured I could multiple all the ingredients by 3/4 to account for the fact that I only had 4 pieces of fruit instead of the 6 required for the recipe.First fail:  You know how people say baking is like chemistry and that everything needs to be measured precisely?  Well, I had to adjust some of the calculated measurements just so I could measure them.  And I ended up with a really, really, really thick batter.  Like closer to cookie dough than cake batter.  I don't think that's right.Second conversion:  Instead of using a tube pan, I used a normal square pan.  In the original post, Deb says that you can probably make the cake in a 9\"x13\" cake pan if you don't have a tube pan.  I figured since I was reducing the quantities in the recipe, I could get away with a 9\" square pan.Second fail:  I think the reason this cake calls for a tube pan is because it take a long time for the middle to bake.  And maybe longer because I had that ridiculously thick batter.  The original recipe says to bake for 1.5 hours or until a tester comes out clean.  Um, at 1.5 hours, the middle of the cake was just barely starting to set, and the edges were all getting burnt.(By the way, The Kitchn just posted a hack on what to do if you don't have a tube pan!)Third conversion:  I only had 1/4 cup all-purpose flour left, so I used that and then used whole wheat flour for the rest of the flour.  I figured, it's a cake with fruit so it's already slightly healthy anyways.  Can't make that much of a difference right?  Um, yeah.  Don't ever do what I did, okay?  Unless you like eat really dense cardboard.But, I was still able to get some decent pictures of the thing.  And I still did eat it.  At least, the top half of it.  The bottom half was unsalvageable.  Hmmm, I should've taken a picture of what was leftover in the pan.Anyways, instead of posting the fail recipe, I'm just going to link over to Smitten Kitchen again.  Because she has the correct recipe AND gorgeous pictures.ETA:  Three years later, I finally conquered this recipe by using the right ingredients and baking pan.One year ago:  Maracons - A Lesson in Humility"},
{"title": "Tim Tam Slam Ice Cream", "date": "Monday, December 7, 2009", "text": "A couple of years ago, I was having dinner with this other girl who kept talking about all the homemade ice cream she made.  After repeated mentions, I couldn't stand it anymore and threw down the proverbial gauntlet and challenged her to an \"ice cream throw down\".  We rounded up two other friends who also made their own ice cream and drew up a list of rules.  We were all to make 3 churned, frozen desserts:  one vanilla ice cream for a baseline, one sorbet, and one free-for-all.  Forty people came to judge, and I'm proud to say that I won the vanilla and sorbet categories with my \"Triple Vanilla Threat\" (frozen custard made with vanilla bean, vanilla sugar, and vanilla bourbon) and Coconut Lime Sorbet, which is really the simplest and yummiest sorbet recipe ever. So for the one category that I lost, I had made a Tim Tam Slam ice cream.  At the time, Tim Tams had yet to be imported into the US, so I actually had saved a package that a co-worker from Australia had sent special to me after I told her how much I loved the cookies.  I was introduced to Tim Tams back when I lived in Taiwan by a couple from New Zealand.  Crunchy chocolate cookies sandwiching a smooth chocolate mousse all dipped in rich chocolate fudge.  You can really only eat one or two at time before going into chocolate overdose.(This is actually a picture I took of the Tim Tams I had 2 years ago; the ones from Pepperidge Farms have a different packaging.)But the best way to enjoy a Tim Tam is to do the Tim Tam Slam!  This involves biting off the ends of the rectangular cookie and using it as a straw to sip up some coffee (or milk or tea).  Just as the liquid reaches your lips, you toss the whole cookie in your mouth and close your eyes in delight as you experience the Tim Tam Slam.Luckily for us, Tim Tams are now available stateside, at least during the colder months of the year, through Pepperidge Farms.  I spied some at the local Shaws the other day, and decided it was high time to try to make a better Tim Tam Slam ice cream, because the Tim Tam Slam really deserved to be enshrined in such a hallowed way.The previous time, I had tried David Lebovitz's recipe for making the coffee ice cream and used Dunkin' Donuts' hazelnut coffee beans.  For whatever reason, the ice cream didn't really turn out as I had hoped.  It's been over two years now so I can't remember exactly what I didn't like about it, but it was just off, somehow.  As a note, my favorite coffee ice cream is the first one I ever tried:  Breyers.  It's the whole reason I even like coffee.Since I've moved away from making frozen custards, I decided it was time to try Jeni's recipe for making no-egg ice cream again since let's face it, the last time was kind of a fail.  And I think I know what the issue was last time.  I bet I didn't let the mixture get a chance to cook enough after adding the corn starch so that it thickened before cooling it.  Because let me tell you, when it starts boiling and thickening, you better get that pot off the heat fast or else it'll boil over.  And I'm sure I'd have remembered something like that happening before.Tim Tam Slam Ice Cream (based on Jeni's ice cream recipe)makes about 1 quart3 tablespoons cream cheese, softened1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon corn starch3 1/2 cups half and half2/3 cup sugar1 1/2 tablespoons corn syrup1/8 teaspoon salt1 tablespoon instant coffee crystals (I used Nescafe)1 package Tim TamsIn the bottom of a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese until soft and loose and set aside.In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of the half and half, making sure the cornstarch is dissolved.  Pour the rest of the half and half into a large pot and whisk in the sugar, corn syrup, and coffee crystals.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and then simmer, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes.Remove from heat and whisk in the cornstarch mixture.  Return the pot to medium-high heat, bring back to a boil, and cook for 1 more minute, stirring or whisking constantly, until the mixture is slightly thickened.Pour the milk mixture into the bowl with the cream cheese and whisk until the cream cheese is combined. Add the salt. Set the bowl into a larger bowl filled with snow or an ice bath and cool, stirring every few minutes, until the liquid is at least down to room temperature. Transfer the inner bowl to the refrigerator and allow to chill thoroughly.Roughly chop the Tim Tams into small bits.Once the ice cream base is chilled, freeze in an ice cream maker, adding the chopped Tim Tams at the very end. Transfer the ice cream to a container and freeze for several hours until firm.I liked this version of the Tim Tam Slam much better, although it still doesn't taste as good as Breyer's coffee ice cream.  Maybe it's something to do with the amount of coffee flavoring or the way I introduced it.  Perhaps it would've been better to add espresso powder or coffee extract.  But the addition of the Tim Tam bits definitely compensates for any faults the ice cream itself may have.  I actually used caramel Tim Tams, which added a nice non-chocolatey dimension to the ice cream, kind of similar to Ben & Jerry's Coffee Heath Bar Crunch ice cream.  The only thing is the caramel gets pretty hard when frozen, but does eventually soften in your mouth.One year ago:  Pan-Fried Pasta with Butternut Squash, Fried Sage, and Pine Nuts"},
{"title": "Wah Guay, or Taiwanese Rice Cake with Meat Sauce", "date": "Sunday, December 6, 2009", "text": "It's been a while since I've posted any recipes from my mom, and I just received a random request for this recipe, so I'd like to introduce you to wah guay, of Taiwanese rice cake with meat sauce.  The name of the dish is Taiwanese, so I don't even know how to correctly pronounce it, much less romanize the spelling.  My mom makes this dish a lot for pot lucks, and it's one of her specialties; I believe she even made up the recipe herself.  All the flavoring comes from the meat sauce which is really pretty salty plus a little sweetness, heat, and umami.  You need all of the saltiness because the rice cake is just steam-baked rice flour and water.  That's it.  But if you make it right, it should come out with a thick, custardy texture that jiggles like Jell-o.Make sure that you use a soy sauce paste for the topping and not regular soy sauce.  Soy sauce paste is more viscous and also slightly sweeter than the normal stuff.  We used it a lot growing up in dipping sauces for things like boiled dumplings and hot pot because the water that inherently deposits with each dip wouldn't dilute the soy sauce paste as much as it would with normal soy sauce.  And if you can find the sweet chili paste, definitely try that.  It's barely spicy, but does cut through the saltiness of the meat sauce just enough.  In a pinch, I guess a little sriracha sauce could do.Wah Guay makes 24 servings1 (16 oz.) bag of rice flour (not the glutinous kind)1 lb. ground pork2 tablespoons vegetable oil1/4 cup fried shallots1/4 cup rice wine2 tablespoons sugar1/2 teaspoon five spice powder6 tablespoons soy sauceSoy sauce paste or chili soy sauce pasteSweet chili paste (optional)Cilantro (optional)Preheat the oven to 350 °F and lightly grease a 9\" x 13\" casserole dish.In a large mixing bowl, mix the rice flour with 2 cups of water using a spatula.  Continue stirring and add 7* cups boiling water in a continuous stream.  Once fully incorporated, transfer to the casserole dish, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and bake for 45-90** minutes until fully set.In a medium-sized pot, heat oil on high until hot.  Add the shallots and fry for 20 seconds.  Add the pork, rice wine, sugar, five spice powder, and soy sauce and continue to cook until meat is no longer pink, breaking the pork into smaller pieces.  Cover, lower the heat, and let simmer for 2 minutes.  Then turn off the heat and let sit covered.Once the rice cake is done, top with the meat sauce.  Drizzle with soy sauce paste and sweet chili paste and top with cilantro, if desired.I am not a big fan of cilantro, so my mom usually just garnishes three-quarters of the dish with the cilantro, leaving an unblemished quarter for me.  Isn't my mommy the best?One note I should make, I tried making this once in grad school in a toaster oven and the rice cake never really \"set\".  And even my mom has said that it hasn't set correctly for her on a few occasions.  Neither of us could figure it out; I'm guessing it has to do with having the perfect ratio of water to rice flour and the ideal conditions for steaming and baking in the oven.*The original recipe listed 9 cups of boiling water, but after making this recipe recently, I would suggest only using 7 cups of boiling water (in addition to the 2 cups of room temp water).  **The original recipe listed a 45 minute bake time, but the last time I made this it wasn't set in the middle yet at 45 minutes.  Next time I'm also going to try stirring the mixture maybe every 15 minutes to ensure a more even bake.One year ago:  Beef Noodle (Soup) and Lu Dan"},
{"title": "Stuffed Delicata Squash", "date": "Friday, December 4, 2009", "text": "I recently received two delicata squashes in my Boston Organics delivery.  Now I know what to do with yellow/zucchini squash, and I have a favorite recipe for butternut squash, but this was the first time I had work with this particular kind of squash.  Luckily, The Kitchn had a post recently about making stuffed squash, which I thought would be the perfect thing to do with these two lovelies.The only thing is, their recipe called for some type of protein (chopped ham, bacon, sausage, etc.) to be added, and I just didn't have anything like that, nor did I really think ham belonged in a stuffed squash.  Bacon or sausage, I can see, but I didn't want to go out and buy some just for this recipe.  They suggested using tofu for a vegetarian version, but that sounded just as weird, if not weirder than using ham.  And then I realized, I had the perfect ingredient sitting in my freezer. Can you guess what it is?One of my vegetarian friends had brought over Vegetable Masala Burgers from Trader Joe's for a barbecue we had over the summer.  There had been no time or room on the grill to cook them, so they've been sitting in my freezer until now.  I figured the burgers would already be seasoned, and after microwaving them and mashing them up with a fork, they would be just about the right consistency to stuff a squash with!Veggie Burger Stuffed Delicata Squashmakes 2 servings2 delicata squashOlive oilSalt and pepper to taste2 veggie burger pattiesButter (optional)Preheat oven to 350°F.Halve the squash lengthwise and scoop out the seeds and pulp with a spoon.  Brush the cut side with olive oil and salt and pepper.   Roast squash cut side up for 30 minutes or until soft when forked.In the meantime, microwave the veggie burger patties for a minute or two until thawed.  They don't need to be hot.  Break up the patties with a fork.Once the squash is done, remove from oven.  Mound veggie burger stuffing in the squash cavities.  Top with a pat of butter, if desired.Return stuffed squash to oven and bake for another 10 minutes.I really did like the taste of the masala burgers with the squash.  If you wanted to add more texture to the stuffing, you could add toasted nuts or roasted sunflower seeds.  If I were using a more traditional flavor of veggie burger, I might also sprinkle some cheese on top, but I think it would have been weird to mix cheese and masala.One year ago:  Salted Butter Caramel Ice Cream"},
{"title": "Kettle Corn", "date": "Monday, November 30, 2009", "text": "Each spring, I look forward to my first game of the season at Fenway Park.  The last three years in a row, I've been lucky enough to get tickets to Opening Day, thanks to my wonderful, beautiful friends who really, really love me.  And while the quality of food offered there is sorely lacking, I can never resist the kettle corn sold in the Grand Concourse.  The aroma of the fresh popped corn plus the melted sugar is all the advertisement it needs.  Of course, it's best when it's still hot, or at least warm, but sometimes all you get is the already-bagged kind which, let's face it, just doesn't compare.I was craving some the other day, and since it is no longer baseball season, I figured I'd try making some, following Jen's recipe on Tiny Urban Kitchen.  If you haven't read her food blog before, you should definitely check it out.  I knew her personally before either of us started food blogging, and her pictures and the recipes she attempts are leagues beyond my own.  Thankfully, this recipe is really quite simple!Kettle Corn (from Tiny Urban Kitchen)makes one big bowl, a little too much for one hungry, popcorn-loving girl, but probably not enough for two ;)1/4 cup canola oil1/3 cup popcorn kernels1/4 cup sugarSalt to tastePut the oil in a pot (ideally a pot with handles and a cover!) and heat to medium high.Put 3 kernels in the oil and wait for the three kernels to pop. When this happens, you know the oil is hot enough.Add the rest of the kernels. They should be spread out in one thin layer at the bottom of the pot.Cover and let pop; it should start popping almost immediately. Start shaking the covered pot around to let the kernels shake around so that the un-popped kernels can get to the bottom where it's hot and also so the popped popcorn doesn't burn.When the popping seems to have slowed down a bit, carefully lift the lid and dump the sugar in.Continue shaking the covered pot around, distributing the sugar and letting the rest of the kernels pop.When it seems like the popping has slowed considerably (1-2 minutes), remove the pot from heat and let it cool. Add salt and stir the popcorn around to make sure the sugar and salt is evenly distributed.Jen mentions that you can use more oil if you want (up to 1/3 cup) and more sugar if you like, but one of the things I like about kettle corn is how the little kiss of sweet and salty makes you crave more.  Too much sugar and you might as well make caramel corn."},
{"title": "Apple-Pear-Cranberry Crisp", "date": "Thursday, November 26, 2009", "text": "Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!  What are you thankful for this year?  Me, I'm thankful that I got to travel to a lot of different countries (Czech Republic, Bolivia, Aruba, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Egypt!), for new friends that I've made, and that my brother got married to a wonderful girl!I almost always staying in Boston for Thanksgiving since my home in Ohio is really too far away to drive to and too expensive to fly to for such a short break.  But it's become tradition to celebrate with other Thanksgiving \"orphans\", and this year I went over to Oeimae, Yumi (thanks for the invite!), and Judy's apartment in Brookline for yet another potluck. This time, I wanted to use up the two pears and two apples I had gotten in my Boston Organics delivery, so I decided to make a apple-pear crisp.  But just those 4 fruits didn't seem to be enough for the 9\"x13\" pan, so I bought a bag of fresh cranberries to add to the mix for some color and tartness.Apple-Pear-Cranberry Crispmakes 24 servings2 apples, peeled, cored, and sliced (I used Fuji apples)2 pears, peeled, cored, and sliced (I used one Bosc and one Concord pear)1 bag fresh cranberries1 teaspoon cinnamon1 dash nutmeg1 1/2 cups flour and 1 tablespoon flour, divided1 teaspoon vanilla extract1 cup sugar1 1/2 cups oats1 1/2 cups brown sugar1/2 teaspoon baking powder1/2 teaspoon baking soda3/4 cups butter, cut into piecesPreheat oven to 350°F.Toss the apple and pear slices with the cinnamon, nutmeg, and 1 tablespoon flour.  Add the cranberries and sugar.  Toss to mix.  Place in a 9\"x13\" baking dish.In a large bowl, add the remaining ingredients and cut the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles a coarse meal.  You can also use a food processor to do this, but I enjoy doing it with my hands.Spread the topping evenly over the fruit.  Bake for 45 minutes.  Serve with vanilla ice cream!That last part of the recipe is key.  Even though there's a whole cup of sugar in the fruit filling, the fresh cranberries are really quite tart.  Eating this crisp with ice cream mellows out the fruit so that the sum is much greater than its parts.This recipe can be adapted to other fruits as well.  You can omit the cranberries and use more of the apples or pears.  A peach or cherry crisp is another possibility, but you'd have to adjust the amount of sugar since those fruits are already quite sweet."},
{"title": "Nanaimo Bars", "date": "Monday, November 23, 2009", "text": "Hi everyone.  Yes, yes, I know.  It's been almost 5 whole months since I posted.  It's unforgivable really.  But you see, the reason I started this blog in the first place was because my second love, the Red Sox, were taking their winter break and I wasn't traveling as much for work anymore so I needed something to occupy my time.  And well, what do you know, it's that time of the year again!  So please forgive me, and get ready to start drooling again!Last week The Kitchn had a post on nanaimo bars (apparently pronounce nah-NAI-mo):  a three-layer dessert bar with a cocoa coconut crust, vanilla custard middle, and chocolate top.  With over 2 whole sticks of butter in the recipe, what's not to love?  And I just happened to have all the ingredients except for the cream in my fridge and cupboard so I decided to make a batch for a pre-Thanksgiving potluck dinner.Nanaimo Bars (adapted from City of Nanaimo via Eclectic Cook and The Kitchn)makes 40+ barsBottom Layer½ cup unsalted butter¼ cup sugar5 tablespoons cocoa powder1 egg beaten1 ¼ cups graham cracker crumbs½ cups finely chopped almonds*1 cup coconut*Melt first 3 ingredients in top of double boiler. Add about a third of the hot mixture to the beaten egg a spoonful at a time to temper.  Add the egg mixture to the pot and stir to cook and thicken (roughly 3 minutes).  Pay careful attention to the mixture when cooking so that the egg does not curdle.  If you start seeing any lumps, immediately remove from heat and keep stirring.  Stir in crumbs, coconut, and almonds.  Press firmly into an ungreased 8\" x 8\" pan.Second Layer½ cup unsalted butter2 tablespoons and 2 Tsp. cream*2 tablespoons vanilla custard powder*2 cups icing sugarCream butter, cream, custard powder, and icing sugar together well. Beat until light. Spread over bottom layer.Third Layer4 ounces semi-sweet chocolate2 tablespoons unsalted butterMelt chocolate and butter over low heat.  Cool.  Once cool, but still liquid, pour over second layer and chill in refrigerator. Cut into 1 inch squares and serve slightly chilled.*A note about the ingredients:  the type of cream and coconut was not specified, and I ended up using light cream and sweetened, shredded coconut.  And instead of using vanilla custard powder, I substituted with French vanilla instant pudding powder.  Also, instead of using finely chopped almonds, I substituted with almond meal.  I've never had one of these bars before, so I'm not sure if you could tell a difference in texture.I found that the quantity of ingredients that the recipe calls for in the third layer to be barely enough to cover the middle layer.  And even though the recipe calls for the third layer to cool before spreading over the second layer, I found that even when it was still warm it was getting quite viscous.  I was afraid that if I waited for it to cool too much I wouldn't be able to spread it out so I ended up using it while it was still warm.  Of course, then I found out the reason why you want to wait until it is cool is because the second layer can melt and start blending with the third layer.  =(At the potluck, everyone seemed to like the bars, and it was agreed that a 1 inch square bar was enough.  As rich as the recipe is, I thought the bars were otherwise a little bland.  Personally, I could have used a little salt in the recipe to round out the richness.  I think either using salted butter or sprinkling the top with sea salt would've done the trick.  Another direction I would go is to add almond extract to the custard layer to brighten it up a bit.One year ago:  Homemade Crystallized Ginger"},
{"title": "Curried Carrot Soup", "date": "Monday, July 6, 2009", "text": "I got yet another bag of baby carrots in my Boston Organics delivery last week and suddenly remembered one way (other than carrot cake or carrot cake ice cream) that I've enjoyed carrots:  in a curried soup.  I don't even remember where I first tried it; I think it was either at Au Bon Pain or in one of the soup cartons from Trader Joe's.  I just remembered that I couldn't really taste the carrots, which is exactly what I was looking for.A quick google search gave me Rachael Ray's version as the first hit.  It looked simple enough, but I added a few tweaks.  I used half an onion and replaced the other half with a shallot since it was all I had.  I also halved the amount of butter, added 2 teaspoons of fresh, chopped ginger, and replaced the sour cream with nonfat plain yogurt.Curried Carrot Soup (adapted from Rachael Ray's recipe here)makes 4-6 servings1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil1 tablespoon butter1/2 medium onion, chopped1 shallot, chopped2 teaspoons fresh peeled ginger, finely chopped1 pound packaged baby carrots2 (13.5 oz.) cans chicken broth1 1/2 tablespoons curry powder1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepperKosher saltNonfat plain yogurtSnipped scallions (optional)Preheat medium pot over medium high heat.

{"title": "Daring Cooks Challenge #2:  Homemade Bulgogi Dumplings", "date": "Sunday, June 14, 2009", "text": "My first thought after seeing the second Daring Cook's challenge was, \"Why mess with perfection?\"  Jen from Use Real Butter had chosen Chinese dumplings as the challenge, which coincidentally, was one of my first posts on The Cooking of Joy.  I've been making my mom's recipe for dumplings for as long as I can remember not only because it's my mom's but quite simple because it is the best-tasting dumpling I've ever had.  In my opinion, it has the perfect ratio (1:1) of meat to vegetable and is just seasoned enough that you can serve it boiled with only some sriracha sauce for heat, if you want.  So seriously, why mess with perfection?But Jen's request to \"try something different\" if we'd made Chinese dumplings before echoed in my head as a challenge.  Then when I came up with the idea to make kalbi using the kiwi, pear, and apple I had gotten in my Boston Organics delivery, I started thinking about making a beef dumpling filling with the same marinade.  And using Romaine lettuce instead of napa cabbage as the vegetable since Romaine is traditionally eaten with kalbi and bulgogi (Korean marinated barbecued sirloin beef).  And ssamjang (seasoned soybean paste) as the condiment.  And thus, the bulgogi dumpling was born.One of the other requirements for the Daring Cook's challenge was to make your own wrappers.  Jen had posted a recipe that used warmed water instead of the boiling water recipe I was used to.  Since I was doing something different anyways, I figured I'd try her recipe (using her mom's version to mix the dough) but I soon realized that I much preferred the boiling water version.  The warm water version gave a really stiff dough that was much harder to work with.  At first I thought that maybe I hadn't added enough water, but the recipe only called for 1/2 cup water for 2 cups of flour, and I had already added about 2/3 cup of water.  So I ended up scrapping half of the warm water dough and making a half batch of the boiling water dough, which I've reprinted here.  Using the boiling water and kneading the dough for a good five minutes allows the dough to develop a lot of gluten.  Resting it for 20 minutes makes it even more pliable so that you should have no problems rolling out your wrappers and stretching them while wrapping.   Above is a side by side visual comparison of the two wrappers with the boiling water ones on the right.  The reason for the color discrepancy is simply because I ran out of bleached all-purpose flour after making the warm water wrappers and used unbleached all-purpose flour for the boiling water ones.Bulgogi Dumplingsmakes about 56 dumplings1 bundle bean thread vermicelli1 lb. ground beef (I used 80% lean meat)1/2 head romaine lettuce, washed and roughly chopped3 scallions, roughly chopped1/2 cup kalbi marinade1/2 tablespoon sesame oil56 homemade dumpling wrappers (recipe below)Soak the bean thread vermicelli in a bowl filled with hot water for 15 minutes.While the vermicelli is soaking, use a food processor to mince the lettuce and scallions.  Transfer to a large mixing bowl.Squeeze out the excess water in the vermicelli and use the food processor to chop into about 1/2\" pieces.  Add to the mixing bowl.Add the ground beef, marinade, and sesame oil and mix well.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.Once you have your dumpling wrappers ready, prepare plates or trays with flour for dipping.  Put a spoonful of the filling in the middle of a wrapper and fold in half.  Seal center portion of the joined edges.  Make two pleats on both the left and right side of the dumpling.  Make sure that the whole thing is totally sealed and then dip the bottom in the flour and place on the tray.  Here are step-by-step photos to show you how it's done, or you can check out this video, but ignore the part about wetting the edges.  Since we are using fresh dumpling wrappers here, you can skip that step.To pan-fry the dumplings, heat a frying pan on high and add oil once it is hot.  Once the oil is hot, add the dumplings one at a time so that they are sitting upright.  Once the bottoms are browned, add about a 1/2 cup of water (for 8 dumplings, my usual serving size).  If you like your dumplings extra crispy, add 1 tablespoon of flour or cornstarch to the water and mix to get rid of the lumps before you add it to the pan.  Be very careful as the steam coming off the pan may burn you.  Cover and let cook for a few minutes until the water is almost all gone. Remove the lid and let the rest of the water cook off.Homemade Dumpling Wrappers (adapted from here)makes about 56 wrappers3 cups all-purpose flour1 cup boiling water4 tablespoons cold waterFlour for dustingPour boiling water into the flour, quickly stir with a fork or chopstick, mix well, then add the cold water. Mix and knead into a soft dough about 5 minutes.Cover with damp cloth or paper towel. Set aside and rest for 20 minutes.Knead the dough for 1 minute and divide into 4 quarters. Roll one quarter into a long snake and pinch into about 1 inch lengths.Dust flour on work surface. Roll each piece into a circle of about a 3 inch diameter.  Try to make the edges thinner than the middle.Instead of the usual soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, and sugar dipping sauce I like to have with my dumplings, I just served it with ssamjang.  The intense saltiness of the season soybean sauce complemented the sweetness of the marinade, but I have to admit both flavors were a little too strong, so I tried wrapping some Romaine lettuce around a dumpling, similar to how I like to eat my kalbi. This combination ended up being perfect as now there was a balance of all the oral senses:  taste (sweet and salty), temperature (hot and cold), and texture (crunchy and soft).So once again, the Daring Cooks Challenge forced me to try something I normally wouldn't have made, which is the point of a challenge, I suppose.  To be honest, I'll probably continue to stick with my mom's dumpling recipe and store bought wrappers, but it was pretty fun to make these, and I'm looking forward to next month's challenge!"},
{"title": "Kale Chips", "date": "Wednesday, June 10, 2009", "text": "I was lucky enough to score tickets to all three Red Sox Yankees games this week, which also meant I'd have three days of Fenway food temptation to deal with.  I mean, I love those Fenway franks as much as the next girl, but three days in a row of hot dogs for dinner is a little overboard, even for me.  So I decided to use up the kale I'd gotten in my last Boston Organics delivery and make a little snack for myself (and the 2 vegetarians I was going with). This recipe is super duper simple, and I've even pared it down from the first time I made them.  The first time I'd read somewhere that you could toss the kale in a vinaigrette before baking them, but I found that it was too much liquid and ended up having to bake the chips a lot longer just to get them crispy.  Yesterday I tried making them with only oil and salt, and they came out perfect.  They kind of remind me of Korean roasted seasoned seaweed, only not as pretty.Kale Chipsmakes a sandwich bagful1 bunch kaleCooking spraySea saltPreheat the oven to 350 °F.Wash the kale and tear into bite-sized pieces.  Dry well in a salad spinner.Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray liberally with cooking spray.  Add the kale pieces in an even layer and spray with more cooking spray.  Sprinkle sea salt on top to taste (I used about a teaspoon) and toss.Bake kale for 10-15 minutes, tossing at least once, until crispy.  Do not let them get too brown or else they will be bitter.The only sad thing about making kale chips is that they shrink so much so you only end up with a baggie-ful when you started off with a whole bunch.  And they're pretty addictive, so they only last a half inning or so.  Unless it's the inning where Papi hits his third homerun of the year and the Red Sox went on to score two more runs.  Because that was a pretty long inning.  Just sayin'.I think I'll make some wok-fried edamame with garlic to bring to tonight and tomorrow's game.

{"title": "Butter Mochi Cupcakes", "date": "Wednesday, June 3, 2009", "text": "For Annie's birthday party this past Sunday, I wanted to make ice cream and cupcakes and decided on black sesame ice cream and butter mochi cupcakes after she said she liked the Asian flavor ice creams and requested a non-citrusy cupcake.  I've made mochi cake before, but when I looked up recipes for the cupcakes on-line, I noticed that there was a lot less milk used in the recipe I found than in the recipe I usually used.  I also came across recipes for butter mochi, which used coconut milk in addition to or instead of milk.  So I decided to combine the two to make butter mochi cupcakes!Butter Mochi Cupcakes with Sweetened Red Beansmakes about 26 cupcakes1 stick unsalted butter, melted (and cooled to room temperature)1 cup white sugar3 eggs1 teaspoon vanilla extract1 can coconut milk1 pound (16 ounces) glutinous rice flour (the green bag with the 3 elephants on it)1 teaspoon baking powder1 (18.75 oz.) can sweetened red beans (or red bean paste) Preheat oven to 350°F.  Line muffin tin with cupcake liners and spray the inside of the liners with cooking spray.In a large bowl, mix together the butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla and coconut milk.  Stir in the rice flour and baking powder and mix well.Fill the cupcake liners about halfway with the batter.  Place about a teaspoon of the sweetened red beans on top of the batter.  Divide the remaining batter evenly among the liners.  The liners should be 80-90% full.Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven or until golden brown.Since I wasn't going to frost these, I experimented with a couple of ways to decorate them.  For the cupcake in the very first picture picture, I just left it as is with the red bean sandwiched between two layers of batter.  I also tried using a toothpick to swirl the red bean layer around with the batter and putting some whole red beans on top in a flower pattern.  I ended up liking the first kind the most because they were the only ones that got nice and golden brown on top.  The swirls that I tried were really too thin and faint, and the whole red beans ended up migrating during the baking process so you couldn't even tell it used to be a flower.In the end, I thought the cupcakes were just okay.  They tasted fine, but they didn't develop the nice crust that I get when I make my normal recipe for mochi cake.  Whether that's because of the tweaked recipe with less liquid or because there was no contact with a metal surface or a combination of the two, I'm not sure.  I also didn't think the texture of the cupcake was conducive to cupcake form.  It was soft and sticky (as it should be) which meant that it stuck to the cupcake liner (even though I sprayed it with cooking spray) and lost its shape as it was eaten.  In my opinion, you should be able to easily peel the liner away from a cupcake, and it shouldn't turn into a blob when you try to eat it.  So I think I will stick to making mochi cake in sheet cake form with my original recipe, although I may try it with coconut milk instead of regular milk next time.Stay tuned for the black sesame ice cream recipe which turned out much better.  =)"},
{"title": "Homemade Banana-Sweetened Granola", "date": "Tuesday, June 2, 2009", "text": "I'm lucky enough to work at a place that supplies free milk (skim, 2%, and whole!) so my breakfast each weekday morning is usually some type of cereal and milk.  I never considered making my own granola before, though, because I remember all the hype when I was younger about how much sugar and fat is in granola.  Then I came across this recipe for banana-sweetened granola that seemed too good to be true.  Not only did the recipe not contain any sugar (using a banana and some maple syrup-or in my case, honey, because I didn't have any maple syrup-as sweeteners) but it also didn't list oil as an ingredient (although the almonds, flax seeds, and shredded coconut that I added contain natural fats).  I don't know how this compares to homemade granola that uses sugar and oil, but I do know that this was good enough to eat as breakfast for a whole week!Homemade Banana-Sweetened Granola (based on this recipe at Delicious By Nature)makes about 6 servings1 ripe or frozen banana 3/4 cup water 1 tablespoon honey 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1 teaspoon vanilla 1/4 teaspoon sea salt2 cups rolled oats 1/4 cup almonds, chopped 1 cup shredded coconut2 tablespoons flax seeds 1/2 cup raisinsPreheat oven to 375° F.Using a blender, blend together banana, water, honey, cinnamon, vanilla, and sea salt until very smooth.Toss banana puree together with rolled oats and nuts.  Lay everything out in a single layer on a tinfoil lined baking pan (it may stick a little).  Bake for 40 minutes until oats are starting to brown.  Stir 4 times throughout, breaking up any clumps that are forming.Add shredded coconut when there are 12 minutes left of baking time to lightly toast.Remove from oven and add the flax seeds and raisins.  Serve with milk or yogurt or as a snack on its own.Feel free to substitute different nuts, seeds, and dried fruits if you like.  I just added the shredded coconut because I still had some leftover from making the Samoa cupcakes and the raisins from making the carrot cake ice cream."},

The recipe said that I'd need about 10 medium-size oranges and 2 medium-size lemons, but I found that the 4 oranges made enough juice for half the recipe.  I also added a splash of citrus vodka to the mixture right before adding it to the ice cream maker to keep it from being too icy.Fresh Orange Sorbet (from Cooking Light)makes about 6 cups2 1/2  cups  water1  cup  sugarOrange rind strips from 2 oranges2 2/3  cups  fresh orange juice1/3  cup  fresh lemon juiceSplash of citrus vodka (optional)   Combine water and sugar in a small saucepan, and bring mixture to a boil.  Add orange rind strips; reduce heat, and simmer 5 minutes.  Remove and discard orange rind strips.  Remove liquid from heat, and let cool to room temperature.  Stir in orange juice and lemon juice.  Chill in refrigerator until completely cool.Right before churning, add the splash of citrus vodka.  Freeze in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions.  Serve immediately.When I was churning the sorbet, I noticed these icy globules forming which made me concerned that there might be globs of ice in the sorbet surrounded by sticky orange syrup (similar to what happens when you freeze orange juice), but the texture of the sorbet ended up being pretty uniform.I did neglect to read the instructions to the end and ended up freezing the sorbet overnight instead of serving it immediately.  Despite the addition of the alcohol to lower the freezing temperature, the sorbet did get quite hard and icy so that the texture was more like a granita.  It was still quite refreshing, however, and I found the combination of the flavor and texture strangely addictive.  I love how it tastes like fresh-squeezed orange juice even days after it was made.  And the fact that it was ice cold made it all the more perfect as a summer dessert or palate cleanser."},
{"title": "Kalbi (Korean Barbecue Short Ribs)", "date": "Tuesday, May 26, 2009", "text": "Still Life of Marinade IngredientsMy friend Vince* is known for his kalbi recipe, so when I asked him for it, this is what he gave me:-1 cup ajimirin sauce-1/2 can of 7-Up-1 kiwi-1 yellow onion-1 red apple-1 pear...preferably Asian pear-1/2 cup garlic-Blend all these ingredients together and take 3 cups of the blend and mix it with the 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of soy sauce.I laughed when I first read this because of the lack of instructions on how to prepare the fruits.  Was I supposed to peel and core the apple and pear?  I wasn't supposed to throw the whole kiwi into the blender, right?  When I asked him for clarification, he said that what he sent me was what he got verbatim from his Korean friend.  There was also something in the recipe about \"tenderizing\" the short ribs, but there were no details as to how to do that.  Seeing as how kalbi meat is so tender already, I figured I could just skip that part.Perhaps the hardest part about making kalbi is finding the right cut of meat.  You want to get beef short ribs that are cut across the bones, not with, which is how they're usually sold in American grocery stores.  I just found out via the recent post on thekitchn.com that this is called a \"flanken\" count (not the same as flank steak).  The only place I've found this cut is at a local Korean grocery store.  Sara Kate, who wrote the post, suggests \"slicing the traditional three-rib short ribs down to the bones length-wise and splaying them on the grill\" if you can't find the flanken cut.Kalbi (Korean Barbecue Short Ribs)serves 8-12 people6 lbs. flanken cut beef short ribs1 kiwi1 yellow onion, roughly chopped1 red apple, peeled, cored, and roughly chopped1 pear (preferably Asian pear, but I had a Bosc so I used that), peeled, cored, and roughly chopped1/2 cup peeled garlic gloves1 cup ajimirin sauce (I didn't have any so I substituted rice wine)1/2 can of 7-Up1 cup soy sauce1 cup sugarCut the kiwi in half and remove the meat using a spoon.  Add the kiwi meat to a blender along with the onion, apple, pear, garlic, mirin (or rice wine) and 7-Up.  Puree using the blender.  Measure out 3 cups of this mixture into a medium mixing bowl and add the soy sauce and sugar.Arrange the ribs in a baking dish (you may have to use two depending on the size of your dish) and pour the marinade over them, making sure that all surfaces are exposed to the marinade.  Alternatively, you can use two gallon-sized freezer bags.Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours, turning the ribs around a few times so they marinate evenly.Grill the ribs over high heat.  I do about 3 minutes on each side because my ribs are cut pretty thin, but you may have to grill yours longer if yours are thicker.  If you don't have a grill, you can also pan-fry or use the broiler to cook the ribs.  I used my electric grill and cooked it outside because the smell is heavenly, but not something you want to stick around for days.Serve with washed Romaine lettuce leaves, cooked rice, and ssamjang (Korean spicy bean paste).  Each person should remove the meat from the bones and wrap the meat in the the lettuce along with the rice and bean paste.  Don't forget to gnaw on the meat in between the bones; it's hard to get to, but oh so worth it!If you're not planning on cooking the ribs right away, you can freeze them in the freezer bags after adding the marinade.  When you're ready to cook them, defrost defrost overnight in the refrigerator.I <3 Kalbi!*Breaking news!  I just found out that Vince liked the kalbi recipe so much, he ended up dating the girl that gave it to him!  Perhaps I should rename this post:  A Kalbi Worth Dating For...."},

I've definitely enjoyed trying to figure out how to use up all the produce every two weeks and my diet has definitely benefited from being \"forced\" to eat more fruits and veggies than I would if I didn't have this service.From the last delivery, I ate most of the fruit as is, made guacamole from the avocado, tomato, and onion; tomato and eggs over rice with the rest of the tomato; caramelized the onions and carrots (basically the only way I will eat carrots); sauteed the yellow squash with garlic; and made coconut curry noodles with the collard greens.This week I got 1 Bosc Pear, 2 Cameo Apples, 2 Fair Trade Bananas, 1 Kiwi, 1 Lemon, 2 Valencia Oranges, 1 bunch Asparagus, 1 bag Baby Carrots, 1 bunch Chard, 1 Salad Tomato, and 1 Zucchini.  I was actually a little confused when I saw the chard (the leafy green vegetable in the picture above) because I'm more familiar with the red stem kind.  But after googling for images of \"chard\" I guess there are non-red steam kinds of chard. Am thinking about making a kalbi marinade with one of the red apples, the pear, and the kiwi.  Since I'll most likely have some leftover marinade, will probably use it to marinate some of the leftover meat I have in the freezer from hot pot and use it for bibimbap along with the chard, carrots, and zucchini.  Thinking about roasting the asparagus, and maybe making an orange-lemon sorbet with the citrus.  And I'll probably make tomatoes and eggs over rice again just because I like that dish so much.  =)"},
{"title": "Fresh Strawberry Ice Cream", "date": "Wednesday, May 20, 2009", "text": "I wanted to bring some homemade ice cream to Ely's birthday party so I asked him what his favorite ice cream flavor was.  \"Strawberry and chocolate chip cookie dough,\" he said.  As tempted as I was to add chocolate chip cookie dough to strawberry ice cream, I resisted, and ended up making the best strawberry ice cream I've ever tasted.I found the recipe on epicurious.com, and it was originally printed in the June 2001 issue of Gourmet magazine with the tagline, \"Don't let the unexciting name of the recipe fool you—this ice cream is unusually good.\"  I wondered what they meant by \"unusually good\", and I think they were referring to how the addition of a little citrus totally brings out the freshness of the strawberries, kind of like how cilantro brings out the freshness of savory dishes.Compared to other frozen custard recipes I've made in the past, this one had a lot more cream (no milk at all) and used the whole egg instead of just the yolks.  I was afraid with that much cream it would leave a greasy coating on the tongue, but that didn't happen at all.  I did substitute lime zest and lime juice for the lemon since I had a lime but no lemon.  And instead of pureeing the strawberries in a blender, I used an immersion blender to mash the strawberries so as to leave chunks of fruit in the final product.  Since I wanted the chunks, I wasn't able to strain the strawberry mixture to remove the seeds, but I don't think it really mattered at the end.Fresh Strawberry Ice Cream (based on the recipe from Gourmet June 2001)makes about 1 quart1 3/4 cups heavy cream3 (3- by 1-inch) strips fresh lime zest1/8 teaspoon salt2 large eggs3/4 cup sugar1 lb strawberries (3 cups), trimmed and quartered1 tablespoon fresh lime juice Combine cream, zest, and salt in a heavy saucepan and bring just to a boil.

Pour back into saucepan and cook over moderately low heat, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened and an instant-read thermometer registers 170°F (do not let boil).   Immediately pour custard through a fine sieve into a metal bowl, then cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally.  Chill, covered, at least until cold, about 2 hours, and up to 1 day.

{"title": "Sage and Apricot Shortbread Cookies", "date": "Monday, May 18, 2009", "text": "After making the Zuni ricotta gnocchi with browned butter and sage, I had a bunch of leftover fresh sage.  I could've made another savory dish, but then I spotted Tartelette's post for rosemary and apricot shortbread cookies, which in turn, were based on Better Homes and Garden's apricot-sage cookies.  This was quite serendipitous because I was actually looking for a way to use up this most wonderful apricot & almond butter I had bought from the Ferry Building Farmer's Market when I had visited SF a couple of weeks ago.  This stuff is out of this world.  As in when I had my first taste, my eyes lit up just like Jonathan's did when he tasted the honey in 1 Samuel 14.  That's right, it's Bible-quoting good.I'd been hogging it all to myself, just smearing some on whole wheat toast and eating that for breakfast, second breakfast, elevensies, etc.  But I realized it deserved to be showcased and shared.  And sage shortbread cookies sounded like a pretty good way to do that.Sage and Apricot Shortbread Cookies (based on the recipe from BHG.com)makes 20 sandwich cookies1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour1/3  cup sugar1/4  cup yellow cornmeal1/2  cup butter2  Tbsp. snipped fresh sage3  Tbsp. milkApricot spreadable fruit (I used June Taylor's apricot & almond butter) Preheat oven to 375 °F.  In a bowl stir together flour, sugar, and cornmeal.  Cut in butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs (I used a fork for this).  Stir in sage.  Add milk.  Stir with fork to combine; form into ball.  Knead until smooth; divide in half. On lightly floured surface, roll half the dough at a time to 1/4-inch thickness.  Using 2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out dough.  Place cutouts 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake about 10 minutes or until edges are firm and bottoms are very lightly browned.  Transfer cookies to wire rack.  Cool.  Spread bottoms of half the cookies with spreadable fruit.  Top with remaining cookies. To store:  Place in layers separated by waxed paper in an airtight container; cover.  Store at room temperature up to 3 days.  Or freeze unfilled cookies up to 3 months.  Thaw cookies; fill with spreadable fruit.  Unfortunately, I discovered that the apricot & almond butter wasn't really viscous enough to be used in a sandwich cookie; it kept smooshing out the sides when you bit into the cookie.  And interestingly enough, I could barely taste the sage, although almost all my friends who tried it immediately commented on the savoriness of the cookies.  Personally, I probably would've added some salt to the cookie mix or sprinkled some sea salt on top of the cookies right before baking them."},
{"title": "Zuni Ricotta Gnocchi with Browned Butter and Sage", "date": "Thursday, May 14, 2009", "text": "When I checked to see what the inaugural challenge for the Daring Cooks was, I just happened to be in San Francisco, the same city where the Zuni Cafe resides.  Having never had ricotta gnocchi, I figured I better stop by the restaurant and taste the real thing before I went about trying to make it.  I'm really glad I did because I probably would've have been tempted to douse my gnocchi with some type of heavy tomato-based sauce, but what this ultra-light pasta needs is something much more simple.  Something like browned butter and sage.Now I won't lie and say this recipe was simple, because it's not.  (And I've tried to simplify the recipe as much as possible here.)  You need to drain the ricotta the day before, and then there's this really delicate handling of the gnocchi while forming it that definitely needs a lot of careful attention.  But if you do everything correctly, what you'll end up with is so light and fluffy in texture, yet so rich and decadent in taste that you'll be thinking about these long after you've finished your meal.  I know I was.Zuni Ricotta Gnocchi with Browned Butter and Sage (gnocchi recipe from the Zuni Cafe Cookbook)serves 4 to 6For the gnocchi:16 oz. fresh ricotta2 large cold eggs, lightly beaten1 tablespoon unsalted butter3 fresh sage leaves, minced1/2 oz. Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated (about ¼ cup very lightly packed)about 1/4 teaspoon salt (a little more if using kosher salt)all-purpose flour for forming the gnocchiFor the sauce:1/2 cup unsalted butter1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage1/2 teaspoon kosher salt4 dashes ground nutmegThe day before you want to make the gnocchi, line a sieve with cheesecloth or paper towels and place the ricotta in the sieve. Cover it and let it drain with a bowl underneath for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours in the refrigerator.Place the drained ricotta in a large bowl and mash it as best as you can with a rubber spatula.  Add the lightly beaten eggs to the mashed ricotta and stir to combine. Melt the tablespoon of butter with the chopped sage.  Add a little at a time to the ricotta and egg mixture while stirring so that the eggs don't cook.  Add the Parmigiano-Reggiano and the salt. Beat all the ingredients together very well.  You should end up with a soft and fluffy batter with no streaks (everything should be mixed in very well).Fill a small pot with water and bring to a boil.  When it boils, salt the water generously and keep it at a simmer. You will use this water to test the first gnocchi that you make to ensure that it holds together and that your gnocchi batter isn’t too damp. In a large, shallow bowl, make a bed of all-purpose flour that’s 1/2\" deep. Using a tablespoon, scoop up about a tablespoon of batter and then holding the spoon at an angle, use your finger tip to gently push the ball of dough from the spoon into the bed of flour.Use your fingers to very gently dust the gnocchi with flour.  Gently pick up the gnocchi and cradle it in your hand rolling it to form it in an oval as best as you can; at no point should you squeeze it.  What you’re looking for is an oval lump of sorts that’s dusted in flour and plump. Gently place your gnocchi in the simmering water.  It will sink and then bob to the top. From the time that it bobs to the surface, you want to cook the gnocchi until it’s just firm, about 3 to 5 minutes. If your gnocchi begins to fall apart, this means that the ricotta cheese was probably still too wet.  You can remedy this by beating a teaspoon of egg white into your gnocchi batter.  If your gnocchi batter was fluffy but the sample comes out heavy, add a teaspoon of beaten egg to the batter and beat that in.  Test a second gnocchi to ensure success. Line the sheet pan with wax or parchment paper and dust it with flour.  Form the rest of your gnocchi and place on the sheet pan.  Store the formed gnocchi in the refrigerator for an hour prior to cooking to allow them to firm up.While the gnocchi are in the refrigerator, make the sauce by melting the 1/4 cup of butter in a small saucepan.  Continue to cook and stir until it turns a golden brown (if it gets too dark it will become bitter).  Remove from heat and add the sage, salt, and nutmeg.  Set aside. In the largest pan or pot that you have (make sure it’s wide), bring at least 2 quarts of water to a boil.  Once the water is boiling, salt it generously. Drop the gnocchi into the water one by one. Once they float to the top, cook them for 3 to 5 minutes.  With a slotted spoon, remove the gnocchi from the boiling water and gently drop into the butter sauce. Carefully roll in the sauce until coated. Serve immediately.If you don’t want to cook your gnocchi right away or if you don’t want to cook all of them, you can make them and freeze them.  Once they are formed and resting on the flour-dusted, lined tray, place them uncovered in the freezer.  Leave them for several hours to freeze.  Once frozen, place them in a plastic bag.  Remove the air and seal the bag.  Return to the freezer.  To cook frozen gnocchi, remove them from the bag and place individually on a plate or on a tray.  Place in the refrigerator to thaw completely.  Cook as directed for fresh gnocchi.I have to say, if it hadn't been for this Daring Cooks first challenge, I doubt I would've ever ordered the ricotta gnocchi at Zuni Cafe, much less try to make it.  (I probably would've gotten the roast chicken with warm bread salad because I've been dying to make it ever since I heard about it.)  I'm glad I did, though, if only to broaden my foodie and cooking experiences, and I can't wait to find out what the next month's challenge is."},

{"title": "Coconut Curry Noodles with Collard Greens and Broccoli", "date": "Wednesday, May 6, 2009", "text": "A couple of weeks ago I got two Boston Organics deliveries in a row with collard greens and broccoli.  I was fine with the broccoli, other than possibly getting bored with it, but I didn't really want to make braised collard greens with bacon again.  So when I saw this recipe for creamy coconut collards, I was pretty intrigued.  I would never have thought that collard greens, a staple in Southern soul food, could be used in an Asian-inspired dish.  But it's a brilliant combination; the slightly sweet creaminess of the coconut milk tempers whatever bitterness the collard greens may have left after braising, and the curry gives it just enough kick to cut through the cream.The only thing was, served over rice, the texture was just too blah.  So I tried it over chow mein noodles (not the crispy La Choy kind; the kind that you boil), added some stir-fried broccoli, and the dish turned into something sublime and much, much greater than just the sum of its parts.  I've already made this twice and will most likely make the next time I get collard greens; it's really that good.Unfortunately, I didn't really take note of how much of what I used and basically \"cooked by feel\".  But this dish is too good not to share, so here's what I did:Coconut Curry Noodles with Collard Greens and Broccoliserves 3-4Cut off the florets from 3 stalks of broccoli to end up with about 2 cups of florets.  Mince a clove or two of garlic.  Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok and add the garlic and salt.  Toss in the broccoli and stir fry until bright green, about 2-3 minutes.  Add about 1/2 cup of water and cover to finish cooking by steaming about another 5 minutes.  Once it is done, remove the broccoli from the wok and set aside.Wash the collard greens, remove the stems, and cut the leaves into ribbons.  Mince another clove or two of garlic.  Heat up some oil in the cleaned wok and add the garlic and collard greens.  Stir fry for a couple of minutes and then add a can of coconut milk and curry powder to taste (start with 2 teaspoons).  Cook over medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes until the collard greens are done and the sauce is slightly thickened.  Add the broccoli and toss.  Remove from heat.In large pot, boil salted water.  Add the steamed chow mein to the boiling water and cook for 3 minutes.  Drain and add to the curried coconut collards.  Toss to mix and salt to taste.  Serve hot.You can add chicken or pork to the dish by cutting it into bite-sized pieces and browning it in the hot oil before adding the garlic and collard greens.  If you can't find steamed chow mein, you could probably substitute Hong Kong style egg noodles (like the kind I used for the pan-fried noodles), ramen, or possibly even angel hair cooked al dente.  I probably wouldn't use anything too thick or chewy; the reason why the noodles worked while the rice didn't is because you want some bite in the texture.  I made this with regular coconut milk, but next time I will try it with reduced fat coconut milk.ETA:  I tried it with the reduced fat coconut milk, and it wasn't anywhere near as yummy. If you try making this, please let me know what you think!"},
{"title": "Carrot Cake Ice Cream", "date": "Saturday, May 2, 2009", "text": "I did say that the next time I got carrots in my Boston Organics delivery I would make carrot cake ice cream, and I am a woman of my word.  I basically followed David Lebovitz's recipe from the L.A. Times except I substituted raisins and rum for the currants and whiskey for the simple reason that I didn't have the latter two.Carrot Cake Ice Cream (based on David Lebovitz's recipe here)makes about 1 quartFor the rum-soaked raisins:1/4 cup raisins2 tablespoons rumCombine the raisins and rum in a small bowl.  Cover and let sit overnight in the refrigerator.For the spiced pecans:1 cup pecan halves1 tablespoon butter, melted1 teaspoon ground cinnamon1/4 teaspoon ground cloves2 tablespoons dark brown sugar1/8 teaspoon saltPre-heat the oven to 350 °F.  Toss the pecans with the butter.In a small bowl,  whisk together the cinnamon, cloves, brown sugar and salt.  Pour the mixture over the pecans and toss to coat completely.Spread the pecans on a baking sheet and cook for 12 minutes, gently stirring halfway during baking to candy the nuts.  Remove the tray to a rack and cool the nuts completely.  Once cool, coarsely chop the pecans.  Set aside.For the candied carrots:2 cups finely diced carrots2/3 cup sugar2 tablespoons light corn syrup2 cups waterIn a medium saucepan,  combine the carrots, sugar, corn syrup and water.  Bring to a low boil and cook until the syrup is reduced to about 2 tablespoons and the carrots are translucent and candied, 20 to 30 minutes.  Keep an eye on the carrots during the last few minutes so they do not burn.  Drain the carrots and set aside to cool.For the ice cream base and assembly:1 (8 oz.) package cream cheese1 1/2 cups sour cream (regular or low-fat)2/3 cup sugar1 teaspoon chopped lemon zestSpiced pecansRum-soaked raisinsCandied carrotsIn a large bowl using a hand mixer, blend together the cream cheese, sour cream, sugar, and lemon zest until smooth.  Chill thoroughly.Freeze the base in an ice cream maker.  After churning, gently fold in the spiced pecans, soaked raisins, and candied carrot cubes.  Freeze until firm.This was definitely one of the prettiest ice creams I've ever made.  The candied carrots almost glowed like semi-precious gems studding the white canvas of the ice cream, and the matte brown of the spice pecans added a nice change up of texture.  As for the taste, while it didn't taste exactly like a carrot cake, I did like how you couldn't taste the carrots.  My favorite part was the spiced pecans, probably because of the butter and spices.  If I made this again, I'd probably add some more of the spices to the ice cream base itself to make it more reminiscent of a carrot cake. Next:  Coconut Curry Noodles with Collard GreensPreviously:  Stuffed Artichokes"},
{"title": "Stuffed Artichokes", "date": "Thursday, April 30, 2009", "text": "I've been traveling all week so here's a recipe I made a while back and haven't posted yet.  I remember my first year after moving to Boston, one of my friends, May-Lynn and I decided to explore the North End, Boston's version of Little Italy.  I can't remember the name of the restaurant we decided to eat dinner at, but I do remember ordering stuffed artichokes but not knowing how to eat it once it came to our table.  My only previous experience with artichokes had been with either artichoke hearts or artichoke dip.  No help here.  Finally we asked the waiter, and he directed us to pluck off the leaves and put the wide ends in out mouth and scrape off the meat with our upper teeth.  We proceeded to do as such, but he forgot to mention that we should stop once we got to the choke (the prickly part in the center), and I just remember not really enjoying the experience.When I received two artichokes in my Boston Organics delivery a couple of weeks ago, the only thing I could think of to make was stuffed artichokes, so I looked up a good recipe from allrecipes.com and found this one.  I also looked up how to eat an artichoke, and this time my experience was much more pleasant.Stuffed Artichokes makes 22 whole artichokes1 cup bread crumbs1 clove garlic, minced1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon grated Romano cheese1/8 teaspoon dried oregano1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons olive oil, dividedSalt and pepper to tasteSnip the pointed tips of artichoke leaves, and cut off the stems. Wash and drain. Holding artichoke firmly by base, firmly rap the top of it on a hard surface; this will open it so it can be stuffed.In a medium bowl combine bread crumbs, garlic, Romano cheese, oregano, 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, and pepper; mix well.Press about 1/2 cup of stuffing into each artichoke. Tightly pack stuffed artichokes together in a large heavy saucepan or Dutch oven.  Add enough water to reach half way up artichokes and add 2 teaspoons oil.Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 1 hour, or until leaves pull out easily.Unfortunately, a cooked stuffed artichoke is not that pretty to look at, so no picture of that, but in the tradition of Orangette, here's a picture of what it looked like when I was done eating it.And boy did I enjoy eating it.

Then I realized it was the box of mangoes I won from Our Best Bites.  I had no idea how long they'd been sitting in my warm, stuffy room, so unfortunately a couple of them were in the mushy stage by the time I opened up the box.  But the rest were perfectly soft-ripe.  Since I was leaving on another weekly long trip, I decided I better try to use most of them up and looked online for a recipe for mango sorbet.  I came across Elise's recipe for lime mango sorbet and decided to try that, only I used coconut rum instead of tequila, and I prefer to call it mango lime sorbet because it rolls off the tongue easier.Mango Lime Sorbet (based on Elise's recipe here)makes almost 1 quart1 cup sugar1 cup waterZest from one lime3 ripe mangoes (about 2 1/2 pounds)1/2 cup lime juiceA pinch of salt3 tablespoons coconut rumHeat the sugar, water, and lime zest in a medium saucepan until the sugar has completely dissolved.  Set aside to cool.Cut the flesh from the mangoes.Put the mango pieces, sugar water, lime juice, and salt into a blender.  Blend until completely smooth.  Pour into a medium bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until completely chilled.When ready to put the chilled lime mango purée into your ice cream maker, mix in the rum.  Process the mixture in your ice cream maker according to the ice cream maker directions.  Transfer mixture to a plastic storage container and freeze in your freezer until firm, at least 6 hours.The rum is added to keep the sorbet from getting too icy, but I think it may have done it's job a little too well because even after freezing overnight, the sorbet was a little too soft for my preference.  Next time I'll probably reduce the amount of rum to 2 tablespoons.  Next time, I'd probably also strain the lime zest out of the simple syrup before blending with the mango flesh.  I didn't like how some of the zest accumulated one the ice cream maker blades, ending up with a bolus of lime zest which was rather bitter to the taste.  Otherwise, I really liked how this sorbet wasn't too sweet and was just perfect for a really hot day, like I hear Boston is today.Next:  Stuffed ArtichokesPreviously:  Apple Pie Apple"},
{"title": "Apple Pie Apple", "date": "Friday, April 24, 2009", "text": "Sorry I haven't posted in a while; the main reason is that I've been traveling, namely to San Francisco, the land of the Ferry Building Farmers Market, Zuni Cafe, and garlic fries at AT&T Park.  Got a lot of inspiration from the trip, and I'm sure I'll be posting about that in the near future, but right now I want to talk about the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory's apple pie apple.First of all, yes, it is one of those strange foods that have the name repeated in the modifier, e.g. chicken fried chicken.  It's just one of the many awesome things attributed to this confectionary delight.  Take an apple, dip it in caramel, then white chocolate, and then roll it in a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon and voila!  An apple pie apple.  I used to grab one of these every time I had to travel through the Charlotte airport and was a bit sad when I stopped going down that way, but then I found out that they opened a Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory in O'Hare airport, which I travel through a lot more!Forces aligned once more as I realized I happened to have all the ingredients to make one myself.  I had one beautiful Braeburn apple left from my Boston Organics delivery, caramels leftover from making the Samoa cupcakes, and white candy melts leftover from making the cupcake bites.  The results were identical to the real thing in taste, although not quite as pretty to look at.Apple Pie Applemakes 11 Braeburn apple, washed and dried (can also use Fuji, Golden Delicious, McIntosh, or Granny Smiths)10 pieces of caramel2 oz. white candy melts1 1/2 tablespoons light brown sugar3 dashes cinnamonRemove the apple stem if necessary and insert a popsicle stick down the core.  Put in the apple in the freezer for at least 5 minutes but no more than 15 minutes to chill.Unwrap the caramels and put them in a small microwave-safe bowl along with 1 teaspoon of water.  Melt the caramel in the microwave at 50% power for one minute.  Remove from microwave and stir.  If the caramel is not completely melted, microwave again at 50% power for another 20 seconds.Dip the apple into the melted caramel, using a spoon if necessary to get the caramel up the sides.  Once the apple is covered, place on a greased plate and return to the freezer to chill.In another small microwave-safe bowl, melt the white candy melts in the microwave using the defrost option.  Remove from microwave and stir.  If not completely melted, return to microwave and defrost for another 30 seconds.On a small plate, mix the brown sugar and cinnamon, making sure to crumble any lumps.Once the caramel on the apple is not sticky anymore (but before it is frozen!), remove from the freezer.  If necessary, try to push any caramel that has pooled to the bottom back onto the apple.  Dip in the white candy melts, using a spoon if necessary to get the candy up the sides.Before the white candy sets, roll in the cinnamon sugar mixture.  Place the apple in the refrigerator for a few minutes to allow the white candy to harden.To serve, make 2 parallel slices almost all the way down both sides of the core, leaving the bottom 1/4\" intact.  Rotate 90 degrees and make 2 more similar parallel slices to give you 8 slices you can break off and the core in the middle.If you don't have a popsicle stick, you can probably get away without using one, but it's a lot easier to manipulate the apple in the caramel, melted white candy, and cinnamon sugar mixture if you have one.For an actual apple pie recipe, check out my Salted Butter Caramel Apple Pie with Vodka Pie Crust!Next:  Mango Lime SorbetPreviously:  Moffles!"},
{"title": "Moffles!", "date": "Wednesday, April 15, 2009", "text": "I first heard about moffles through The Kitchn (btw, in case you haven't seen, my bunny buns were featured as a Delicious Link on The Kitchn a few days back!) and decided if there was any way I could get my hands on a waffle iron and mochi blocks, I would definitely try it out.  Well, luckily, my friends Jen and Tammy had a waffle iron and mochi blocks, which Tammy got from a Korean grocery store.  I invited them over with their respective supplies and said I'd provide the toppings.At first I was thinking more traditional waffle toppings like maple syrup, whipped cream, bananas, Nutella, etc., but then Jen suggested we stick to more traditional mochi accompaniments, such as sweetened red beans, peanuts ground with sugar, and black sesame powder, which I thought was a brilliant idea.  Even better, when I was at Super 88 looking for black sesame seeds, I found instant sesame powder mix, which according to the ingredients, already had sugar in it.  As for the peanut powder, I just used a food processor to grind a half cup of raw peanuts with 3 tablespoons of granulated sugar.  Just make sure you don't grind too long or else you'll end up with peanut butter.  You basically want it to look like this:I added sweetened condensed milk to the toppings because I like how it goes with sweetened red beans, and I thought the powders might need something kind of wet and sticky to bind to.  Finally, I made some frozen yogurt on the spot using a cup of vanilla yogurt, 1/3 cup of sour cream, and 1 bottle of Chinese yogurt drink.  I was aiming for something like Pinkberry frozen yogurt, but I failed to add sugar, and the texture wasn't quite there.  Still edible, though.  =)So according to the article, you just throw some mochi blocks on to the waffle iron and let it do its thing.  I set the waffle iron on high, sprayed it with some cooking oil, put two blocks in the center, and closed the top.  The blocks start off dry and dense; basically nothing you'd ever try to eat as is.  But as the heat started cooking the mochi, the blocks began to expand and fill out the entire waffle iron.  After a couple minutes, we were able to press down on the iron to close it, and we took the moffles off the iron once they were coming out the sides.Then we cut each moffle into quarters and started experimenting with the toppings.  I found that the moffle itself didn't have too much flavor, which is not a bad thing as it was really the texture that stands out.  The outside is crispy, almost crackly, while the inside is soft and almost gooey.  In a word, awesome.I really, really liked the sesame powder topping as it reminded me of the sesame filled tang yuan, and the red bean and sweetened condensed milk topped moffles were pretty good too.  I wasn't as big of a fan of the peanut powder, but then, I'm not a big fan of peanuts in general.I would totally make moffles again, if ever such a confluence of a waffle maker and mochi blocks being in my kitchen happened again.  And if you have a waffle maker, I can totally find some mochi blocks to bring by.  ;)"},
{"title": "Bacon and Egg Bunny Buns", "date": "Sunday, April 12, 2009", "text": "When I first saw these on Tastespotting, I just knew I had to make them, and what better venue for some bunny buns than an Easter brunch?  The recipe seemed a little different from the one I use for hua juan, but I decided to follow it exactly.  The only change I made was that I used scallions instead of chives in the bacon egg mixture and used ice cream sprinkles instead of eyes for the chives.Bacon and Egg Bunny Buns (based on this recipe from justhungry.com)makes 12 bunsFor the dough:400 g all-purpose white flour1 packet (7g) instant dry yeast2 tablespoons sugar1/2 teaspoon salt220 ml warm water2 tablespoons vegetable oilextra flour for rolling outFor the filling:2 slices bacon3 large eggs2 teaspoons soy sauce1 teaspoo sugar1 teaspoon rice wine1 tablespoons scallions, finely choppedIn a large bowl mix the dry ingredients for the dough together.  Add the warm water a little at a time, mixing all the time, until it forms a shaggy ball.  Add the oil and knead in the bowl until the dough cleans the sides.  Place on a board (lightly floured if necessary) and knead until smooth.  Form into a ball, place back in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap.  Leave until risen to about 2 1/2 times its original size, about 1 hour.In the meantime, make the filling.  In a dry non-stick frying pan, fry the the bacon bits until crispy but not too black.  Drain well on a paper towel and crumble once cooled.Mix together the egg, soy sauce, sugar and rice wine.  In the same non-stick frying pan (i.e. in the bacon grease), mix the egg around to make scrambled eggs that are firm but not hard (take off the heat while still soft and they’ll continue to cook to the ideal firmness).  Add the scallions and bacon at the end and mix well.  Let cool to room temperature.Punch down the risen dough, roll into a snake and cut into 12 equal pieces.  Make each piece into a small, smooth ball.  Cover with a dampened kitchen towel and let rest for about 15 minutes.Cut parchment paper into twelve 4\" or so sized squares.Make ready the steaming equipment.Flatten a dough ball to about 5\" in diameter, making the edges thinner than the middle part. Place about 1 teaspoon of the filling in the middle of the dough circle.  Don’t try to overfill or you will have trouble closing up the dough. Gather up the dough around the filling, pinching to seal well.  The dough should be moist enough to form a good seal, but if not brush the edges with the tiny bit of water and pinch closed again. Flip the bun over, and form into a longish oval shape, rounding out any bumps if needed.  Look at the bun and decide which end looks best as the ‘face’ of the bunny. Lay a pair of clean, sharp scissors almost flat against the top of the bun lengthwise.  The points should aim for about 1/3 from the ‘face’ end of the bun.  Snip two ‘ears’, taking care not to cut through the dough so the filling is exposed.To make the eyes, poke small holes with a chopstick end and poke in an ice cream sprinkle in each hole. Don’t go too deep!  (If you are in a hurry, just poke the holes and skip the chives.)Place each bun on a piece of parchment paper, and place in a steamer well apart (they will puff up to about twice the size, and any touching parts will not be smooth).  Steam for about 20 minutes.  Eat while piping hot.I found that the dough came out a bit more dry than what I am used to, and as Annie put it, \"there is a flavor to the dough\".  I agreed and thought it tasted like sandwich bread.  This isn't exactly a bad thing, it's just not what is expected from a steamed bun.  If I were to make these again, I'd definitely try it with the dough I use for hua juan.  Also, I'm not so sure I like the soy sauce added to the scrambled eggs; I think the bacon makes it salty enough, and I'd prefer the color of normal scrambled eggs rather than kind of brownish eggs that were in these.  Lastly, I'd definitely not use the ice cream sprinkles for the eyes next time.  As you can see, the color started running when they were steamed, and they kind of look like goth bunnies or Bunnicula."},
{"title": "Matzo Crack", "date": "Friday, April 10, 2009", "text": "I've been saving this post for a while now, but since it's Passover and matzo is everywhere now, I figured it was time.  The reason it's called matzo crack may be because you have to crack it into pieces at the end, but I think it's really because it's so utterly addictive that crack is the only word worthy of such a treat.  You can make something similar with Saltines instead of matzo, but there's something about the texture of matzo that goes really well with this confection.Matzo Crack (from thekitchn.com)Makes about 30 pieces4 to 5 pieces of matzo or enough Saltines to cover the bottom of a baking sheet1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter1 cup chopped bittersweet chocolate, or semi-sweet chocolate chipsPreheat the oven to 375 °F and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and/or parchment paper.Okay, yes, those are Saltines, not matzo, but I love the orderliness of this picture.Place the matzo in one layer on the baking sheet, breaking it when necessary to fill the pan completely.  Set aside.Cooking the toffeeIn a large sauce pan, melt the butter and brown sugar over medium heat, stirring constantly.  Once the mixture reaches a boil, continue to cook for an additional three minutes, still stirring, until thickened and just starting to pull away from the sides of the pan.  Remove from heat and pour over the matzo, spreading an even layer with a heat-proof spatula.Toffee on matzoPut the pan in the oven, then immediately turn the heat down to 350 °F.  Bake for 15 minutes, watching to make sure it doesn't burn.  If it looks like it is starting to burn, turn heat down to 325 °F.Melting the chocolateAfter 15 minutes, the toffee should have bubbled up and turned a rich golden brown.  Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle the chocolate over the pan.  Let sit for five minutes, then spread the now-melted chocolate evenly with a spatula.Let cool completely, then break into smaller pieces and store in an airtight container.You can also add some toasted, chopped nuts on top (before the chocolate sets), but I think my topping of choice the next time I make this will be some sea salt, a la David Lebovitz's version."},
{"title": "Boston Organics, Week 8", "date": "Thursday, April 9, 2009", "text": "From my last delivery, I used the avocado and some cherry tomatoes to make guacamole, the green pepper and the rest of the cherry tomatoes in chilaquiles, served the broccoli and celery as crudites, braised the collard greens in coconut milk, and either used the fruit in a fruit salad or ate them as is.  Unfortunately, I had to toss the turnips because they were all shrunken by the time I thought to use them.This week I decided to downgrade to the Small Box (still 1/2 fruit and 1/2 veggies and $5 cheaper) since I would be out of town for a 5 days next two weeks.  I ended up getting 2 Empire Apples, 3 Fair-Trade Bananas, 2 Fair-Trade Bartlett Pears, 2 Kiwis, 1 Red Grapefruit, 2 Tangelos, 2 Valencia Oranges, 1 bag of Baby Carrots, 1 Green Bell Pepper, 1 bunch Scallions, 1 lb.

{"title": "Rainy Day Coconut Lime Cakelets", "date": "Monday, April 6, 2009", "text": "So Opening Day today got rained out.  =(  I had already taken the day off so when I woke up this morning (before I found out about the rainout), I decided to make the key lime coconut cake recipe from Gourmet but in cupcake form.  Only I didn't have any key limes, so I just used regular limes.  But I accidentally used all 1/4 cup of lime juice in the batter instead of only half the amount.  And I didn't have self-rising flour, so I substituted a mixture of all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt, only I completely misread the recipe and used 3/4 cups instead of 1 3/4 cups.  Um, so what I ended up with wasn't really a cupcake, and for lack of a better term I renamed them cakelets.  =)Coconut Lime Cakelets (adapted from Gourmet)makes 24 cakelets 1 cup sweetened flaked coconut1 stick unsalted butter, softened1 1/4 cups granulated sugar 1 tablespoon grated Key lime zest2 large eggs3/4  cups self-rising flour3/4 cup milk3/8 cup fresh Key lime juice, divided1 cup confectioners sugar1 tablespoon coconut rum (optional)Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle.  Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.Toast coconut in a small baking pan in oven, stirring once or twice, until golden, 8 to 12 minutes.  Cool.  Leave oven on.Beat together butter, granulated sugar, and zest with an electric mixer until fluffy.  Beat in eggs 1 at a time.  Stir together flour and 1/2 cup coconut (reserve remainder for topping).  Stir together milk and 1/4 cup lime juice.  At low speed, mix flour and milk mixtures into egg mixture alternately in batches, beginning and ending with flour.Spoon batter into cupcake liners, filling them a little more than halfway.  Bake until golden, 20 to 22 minutes.Whisk together confectioners sugar, remaining 2 tablespoons lime juice, and rum (if using) and spoon over cakelets.  Sprinkle with remaining coconut.I baked the first batch of cakelets for 20 minutes and noticed that the middle of the cakelets fell in and they were pulling away from the liner as they cooled.  Also, they were still quite soft when I removed them from the tin.  So I baked the next batch for 22 minutes, and while they came out a little more firm, they were a lot harder to remove from the liners.  So I just used a spoon to eat those.Even though they didn't turn out how I expected them to, much like my plans for today, at least they were still quite yummy (unlike my plans for today).  They totally remind me of eating a lemon bar but in cakelet form."},
{"title": "Samoa Cupcakes and the Cupcake Exchange", "date": "Sunday, April 5, 2009", "text": "After seeing Sena's maple cupcakes at Leslie's going away party but not tasting any, I devised a clever plan to be able to try some of her cupcakes:  a cupcake exchange!  I sent out an e-mail to several other baker friends, and we ended up with 6 different batches of cupcakes.  Good thing I invited some friends to help eat, too, because there's only so many cupcakes a girl can eat, even if they're as delicious as the ones that were brought.Sena brought a sundae cupcake that was originally going to be Neapolitan with chocolate and strawberry layers, but then her fiancee suggested adding whipped cream, sprinkles, and a cherry on top!Will brought a root beer banana cupcake with strawberry frosting.  He substituted root beer for the water, and it came out super light and fluffy.Judy brought coffee and walnut cupcakes with a brown sugar streusel on top.Daphne brought lemon curd cupcakes, which she carved out by hand.Lastly, Ruth brought meyer lemon meringue cupcakes.  Look at the awesome piping!I decided to make Samoa cupcakes, inspired by my favorite Girl Scout cookies.  I found this recipe by chockylit, which looks amazing, but I was a little too lazy to make the cupcakes and caramel sauce from scratch so I improvised by using yellow butter cake mix and bought caramels.  The original recipe called for cutting into the cupcakes once they were baked and cooled and filling each one with caramel sauce.  I thought I'd try something a little different; I filled each cupcake liner a little more than halfway with the batter, and then topped each one with a caramel.  My hope was that the batter would rise up around the caramel to enclose it and that the caramel itself was melt a bit in the oven while baking.Samoa Cupcakesmakes 24 cupcakesFor the cupcakes:1 box yellow butter cake mix1 cup water3 eggs1/3 cup butter, softened24 caramelsFor the chocolate ganache:8 ounces semisweet chocolate chips1 cup heavy cream1 teaspoon vanillaFor the toasted coconut topping:4 cups shredded, sweet coconut2 eggs10 ounces evaporated milk11/3 cup sugar1/2 cup (1 stick) butterPrepare the cupcake batter according to the box mix directions.  Fill each cupcake liner a little more than halfway with the batter and top with a caramel.  Bake according to the directions on the box.  Let cupcakes cool completely before frosting.To make chocolate ganache, stir cream and chocolate chips on a double boiler (or use a metal bowl on top of a saucepan of boiling water) until melted.  Add vanilla and stir to mix.  Let cool to room temperature.To make the toasted coconut topping, start by spreading the coconut onto a sheet pan.  Toast in a 350°F oven, stirring frequently to prevent burning, until the coconut is an even brown color, about 10 minutes.  Crack the eggs into a small saucepan and beat lightly to break up.  Add milk, sugar, and butter.  Cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until thick, bubbly, and golden, about 15 minutes.  Press mixture through a metal sieve and into a bowl to remove any lumps.  Add 3 cups of the coconut, reserving the remainder for assembly, stir to combine.  Let the mixture cool.To assemble, smooth on a light coating of chocolate ganache.  Refrigerate for about 15 minutes to harden the ganache. Once hardened, spoon on the coconut topping and spread evenly.  Top with some more plain toasted coconut. Drizzle the top with lines of ganache.  You may have to warm the ganache over a water bath to get it to drizzling consistency.Unfortunately, the caramel sunk to the bottom of the cupcakes and hardened instead of sitting in the middle and softening.  I had to warn everyone to bite carefully into the cupcake, especially if they had any fillings or crowns. Otherwise, I was pretty satisfied with the way it turned out.  One of the guests commented that it smelled just like a Samoa cookie (this was before we started eating), and I thought the coconut topping tasted exactly like the coconut topping on a Samoa.  The original recipe was for 12 cupcakes, so I thought I would need to double the recipe for the chocolate ganache and coconut topping, but it turned out making even the single batch for 12 was more than enough for all 24 cupcakes.  I'll probably have to make coconut lime cupcakes and Samoa bars soon to use up the leftovers.  Good thing Maundy Thursday and Ruth's baby shower are coming up!"},
{"title": "Cupcake Bites", "date": "Thursday, April 2, 2009", "text": "I've been enchanted by the cake pops that Bakerella has been making, especially these Hello Kitty ones, but they just seemed a little too daunting to try so when I saw The Pioneer Woman's post about how Bakerella makes cupcake bites, I knew I didn't have an excuse anymore.  Because while they are just as cute, they're also quite simple to make.  All you need is cake mix, frosting, some sprinkles, a peanut butter candy mold, and melting chocolate in different colors (I got the latter two at Michaels).  I opted to pick up a squeeze bottle as well, but you could just as easily do without.So here's how you go about making them.  First bake a cake.  I chose to use a Devil's Food cake mix, but just about anything will work.  Once it's done, cool it completely and then use your hands to rip it all into crumbs.Add frosting to the crumbs.  Bakerella uses a whole tub, but I don't like mine as sweet so I added about 4/5.  Next time I think I can get away with adding even less.  Basically you just want it to gooey enough that you can roll the cake/frosting mixture into balls without it coming apart.After you've mixed the cake crumbs and frosting thoroughly, let it sit in the fridge to chill.  You can skip this step, but I find that rolling chilled cake crumbs is less messy.  You definitely want to chill the balls once they are rolled, though.  Make sure that the balls are just a little smaller in diameter than the widest part (the top) of the molds.While the balls are chilling, you can start melting the chocolate.  I followed the instructions on the squeeze bottle and filled the bottle halfway and then putting it into some very hot water to melt the chocolate.  If you don't have a squeeze bottle, you can just melt the chocolates according to the directions on the bag in the microwave and use a spoon to dispense it.Make sure you have your balls ready for the next step because it's a little time sensitive.  You want to fill the mold a little less than halfway with chocolate, and while it is still liquid, insert a cake ball and push it down so that the chocolate comes up and fills the rest of the mold.  Once you have finished making a tray, pop it into the freezer to chill for a few minutes.When the chocolate is set, carefully remove them from the tray, and you should have a bunch of unfrosted mini-cupcake looking things.  The next step is also time sensitive, so make sure you have everything ready before you proceed.You'll want to melt some more chocolate (use a different color than what you used for the bottom) in a small bowl.  Holding the cupcake bite by the bottom, dip it into the melted chocolate until it almost reaches the top of the hardened chocolate.  I give it a good whirl in there to make sure that all the sides are evenly covered.  Then place it right-side-up on a plate or tray.  While the top chocolate is still liquidy, top it with some sprinkles.  I didn't get any good shots of this part because, after all, I only have two hands, but you can take a look at the pictures on The Pioneer Woman's post for a better idea.If you wait too long, the top chocolate will get too hard and the sprinkles won't stick.  This happened with some of my yellow cupcake bites, so I had to re-dip the tops to get the sprinkles to stick.  Bakerella uses mini-M&M's for the very top, but since I didn't have any, I used these little red cinnamon candies, which in my opinion, are even cuter because they're smaller.I made a batch for ArtSpeak at Highrock last week as practice for the batch I'm making for the dessert tasting fundraiser I'm participating in this Saturday.  It's called A Little Peace, and it's being held at the Vietnamese American Community Center (42 Charles Street, Dorchester, MA/MBTA Redline @ Fields Corner) from 7 - 10 pm.  Tickets are $27 at the door, and you can find out more here.  I'm actually participating in the Ocean Spray Bake-Off Challenge, which means I needed to incorporate Craisins into what I made.  After thinking about how to do that a bit, I came up with \"Rum Craisin Cupcake Bites\".  Basically the idea is the same as above, but I added some rum to the cake/frosting mixture and rolled each ball around a couple of Craisins before dipping.  I believe voting is done by popular vote among the people who attend, so if you're free on Saturday night, please come to the fundraiser!And if you're free tonight and happen to have an extra $95 lying around, please come to Share Our Strength's Taste of the Nation, being held at the Hynes Convention Center from 6:30 pm - 9 pm.  Basically there will be 74 fine restaurants and 40 wineries from around the area donating their food and drink for an all-you-can-eat-and-drink event plus a live band and silent auction.  Because everything is donated and everyone working it is a volunteer, 100% of ticket sales from Taste of the Nation are granted to the most effective anti-hunger organizations working to end childhood hunger in America.  If you come before 7:30 pm, James and I will be two of the first people you see because we're the champagne pourers!  So even if you don't want to eat some of the best food in Boston and drink to your heart's content, you should come just to see us try to set up a champagne glass pyramid for fun.  =)"},

I had never made bibimbap before, but I ordered it almost every time I went to Super 88, so I figured it was time to try to make some for myself.  I really took the words of the comic strip to heart:  \"...All it was, was nothing.  Or rather, the idea of making something out of nothing.

{"title": "Hong Kong Style Pan-Fried Noodles", "date": "Monday, March 30, 2009", "text": "And now it's time to get back to some more Asian dishes.  Pan-fried noodles are one of my favorite dishes at Cantonese restaurants, and I made this a couple of weeks ago when I needed to used up some (more) leftovers from hot pot as well as some broccoli from a Boston Organics delivery.  I was really surprised at how easy it was; the hardest part was going to the Asian grocery store and finding the fresh Hong Kong style egg noodles.  You could probably try making these with fresh or cooked semolina or non-Hong Kong style egg noodles, but the results won't be the same.  The thin Hong Kong style egg noodles allow you pan-fry them while fresh so that they get crispy and cooked through without needing to boil them first, and they serve as the perfect medium for absorbing the gravy as well.Other than the noodles, you can probably substitute any other meats and veggies you want:  shrimp, beef, pork, chicken, squid, or baby corn, straw mushrooms, snow peas, baby bok choy, Chinese broccoli, etc.Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles (based on sugarlens' recipe)serves 41 (16 oz.) package Hong Kong style noodles (I found these in the refrigerated aisle at the Asian grocery store)2 small chicken breasts, sliced thinly1 small onion, sliced thinly2 cups broccoli, chopped2/3 cup sliced mushrooms3 cloves garlic, mincedMarinade:2 teaspoons corn starch2 teaspoons sesame oil2 teaspoons soy sauce2 teaspoons oyster sauceSauce:2 tablespoons of oyster sauce2 tablespoons of soy sauce1 cup water2 tablespoons of sugar2 teaspoons of cooking wineThickening:1 tablespoon of corn starch1 tablespoon of waterAdd oil to a heated pan.  Add noodles.  The noodles should brown very quickly.  Use a pair of chopsticks or a spatula to make sure the noodles are getting browned evenly.  If you need to, use the spatula to press the noodles against the pan or add some more cooking oil to make sure you brown most of the noodles.  Plate the noodles and set aside.Mix together the ingredients for the marinade and add the sliced chicken.  Set aside.  In a separate bowl, combine the ingredients for the sauce.

{"title": "Whoopie Pies", "date": "Friday, March 27, 2009", "text": "I had some leftover orange cream cheese butter cream from when I made the carrot cake cupcakes so I decided to make whoopie pies to use it up.  I had never heard of whoopie pies until one of my coworkers told me about them.  Apparently they are very popular here in New England and consist a cake-like, usually chocolate flavored cookie sandwiching a white cream filling, kind of like a big Oreo, but much softer.There was a recent article in the NYT asking if whoopie pies might be the new cupcakes, and I think it could totally be true.  After all, if a French macaron and a cupcake had a baby, it would be the whoopie pie.Whoopie Pies (based on this recipe)makes 122 cups all-purpose flour1 teaspoon baking soda1/4 teaspoon salt1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder1 cup white sugar1 egg1/2 cup vegetable oil1 teaspoon vanilla extract3/4 cup milkOrange Cream Cheese Butter Cream (recipe here)Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Sift together the 2 cups flour, baking soda,1/4 teaspoon salt, cocoa and 1 cup sugar. Set aside.In a medium bowl stir together the egg, oil, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 3/4 cup of milk until well blended. Gradually stir in the sifted dry ingredients. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until firm. Allow to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.Pair similar shaped and sized cookies together and sandwich butter cream generously in between.I brought these on the road trip on to Montreal, and both Annie and Dan said that they were pretty good.  The addition of the orange rind was a nice surprise and I think a lot more noticeable paired with the cocoa flavoring than with the carrot cake.  If you need to store these, make sure you wrap them individually, as they will stick to one another."},
{"title": "Cincinnati Chili", "date": "Thursday, March 26, 2009", "text": "I've been wanting to make Cincinnati chili for quite a while but never found the opportunity.  It's definitely one of those dishes you want to make for a large group, and what's more perfect after a day of skiing than some chili?Cincinnati chili differs from what most people would consider traditional chili in that it's a bit more mild and watery and served on a bed of spaghetti and topped with mounds and mounds of fluffy, shredded cheddar cheese.  In fact, it's probably more akin to spaghetti sauce than chili.  The beef is boiled instead of browned to achieve a fine texture, and the secret ingredient is a bit of chocolate.  Yes, chocolate. Cincinnati Chili (based on this recipe)Serves 144 lbs. 80% lean ground beef4 cups water4 (6 oz.) cans tomato paste2 large onions, finely chopped2 cloves garlic, minced4 large bay leaves4 tablespoons chili powder2 tablespoons unsweetened ground chocolate2 tablespoons ground cumin4 teaspoons ground allspice1 tablespoon cinnamon2 teaspoons salt2 teaspoons pepper1/2 teaspoon red pepper2 teaspoons white wine vinegar2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauceHot cooked spaghetti (3 boxes worth)Finely shredded cheddar cheeseChopped onionsSmall red beansCombine ground beef and water in a large stew pot.  Cook until beef is done, crumbling as it cooks.  You want very fine particles of beef.  Stir in everything but the last 4 ingredients.Cover and cook, at a simmer for about one hour.Remove cover and, if necessary, cook down to a good thick consistency.  Remove and discard bay leaves.To serve, mound a bed of spaghetti on your plate.Add the chili.To make 3-way Cincinnati chili, you'd add just the cheese at this point.  For 4-way, you'd add either the onions or beans, and for 5-way, add both onions and beans.Top with a mound of freshly shredded cheddar cheese.The key to the dish is the shredded cheese.  You want to grate it as fine as possible so that it will be incredibly fluffy and melt just from the residual heat from the spaghetti and chili, even though a layer of onions and beans.  To do this, I used my new Microplane grater.  Just look at that cheese; it's like sawdust!  (But in a good, appetizing way)."},

I used the kale and Swiss chard in 2 separate hot pots, make carrot cake cupcakes with orange cream cheese frosting with the carrots and one of the oranges, St. Patrick's Day maki and corned beef hash pasties with the cabbage, duck fat potatoes with the potatoes, stuffed artichokes with the artichokes (recipe forthcoming), and fruit salad with the fruit that I didn't end up eating.  Which leaves the broccoli.  To add to the broccoli I got today.  Hmmm, maybe it's time for Orangette's broccoli soup?This week I got 2 Braeburn apples, 1 avocado, 4 bananas, 1 green bell pepper, 1 bunch broccoli, 1 bunch celery, 1 grapefruit, 2 Valencia oranges, 2 Bartlett pears, 1 red pear, 2 tangelos, 1 box cherry tomatoes, 1 lb. turnips, and 1 bunch collard greens.

{"title": "Carrot Cake Cupcakes with Orange Cream Cheese Frosting", "date": "Friday, March 20, 2009", "text": "I don't like carrots but ended up with a whole pound of them from Boston Organics in my latest delivery.  This wouldn't have been a problem back when I was a kid because my brother liked them, so anytime I had carrots I would just give them to him.  But now that my brother lives on the opposite side of the country, I am forced to do things like make carrot cake cupcakes.  Alas, the tragedy of it all.  By the way, my brother's birthday is this Sunday so happy birthday, Timmy, and pretend I made and mailed these to you!Carrot Cake Cupcakes with Orange Cream Cheese Frosting (based on the recipe from Tartelette's site)makes 30 cupcakesFor the cake:2 cups all purpose flour1 ½ tablespoons ground cinnamon¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg¾ teaspoons baking soda¼ teaspoon baking powder4 large eggs¾ cup vegetable oil1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract2 cups granulated sugar1 teaspoon kosher salt1 pound carrots, grated medium fineFor the frosting:12 oz. cream cheese softened2 1/ 2 cups confectioners’ sugarZest of 1 orange2 sticks butter, softened1 teaspoon pure vanilla extractPreheat oven to 350 °F.  Line muffin tins with cupcake liners.In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, and baking powder.  Set aside.In a large bowl, beat the eggs at high speed until light and frothy, about one minute.  Decrease the speed to medium and add the oil, vanilla, sugar, and salt and mix just until combines.  Decrease the speed to low and add the flour mixture until just combined.  Using a spatula, fold in the carrots.Fill each cupcake liner halfway with batter.  Bake for 18 minutes.  Cool completely before frosting.Combine the cream cheese, sugar, and zest with an electric mixer.  Start on low speed and then increase to medium high speed and beat until smooth.  Add the butter and mix on medium speed until just fluffy and smotth, about 45 seconds.  Add the vanilla and mix until just combined.  Do not overbeat.The original recipe was for a layer cake, but I thought it translated well to cupcake form.  The only issue I had was for the first batch I filled the liners about 2/3 - 3/4 full and the batter ended up overflowing onto the tin when it baked.  Adding orange rind to the cream cheese frosting is ingenious and adds a vibrant aromatic and a very subtle whiff of tartness to the otherwise very sweet topping.  If I had wanted to go the extra mile, I would've added a sprinkle of additional orange zest on top or maybe finely chopped crystallized ginger.  I thought about a carrot curl, but then I'd be defeating the purpose of making these cupcakes because I don't like the taste of carrots.Off to Mount Tremblant and Montreal!"},
{"title": "Corned Beef Hash and Pasties", "date": "Wednesday, March 18, 2009", "text": "I've never really been into corned beef hash, even though I love potatoes, probably because I've only ever had the canned kind.  Which is gross.But I had all this leftover corned beef from making the St. Patrick's Day maki and saw this recipe, so I figured I might as well try.  Actually, I did more than try; I went to Whole Foods at 8 am in the morning to get some onions because we were out just so I could try this recipe.  And boy am I glad I did.  Homemade corned beef hash is so exponentially better than the canned stuff, and it's pretty easy to make too!Corned Beef Hash (based on this recipe from Simple Recipes)serves 4-62-3 tablespoons unsalted butter or duck fat (guess which one I used)1 medium onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)2-3 cups finely chopped, cooked corned beef2-3 cups chopped cooked potatoes, preferably Yukon gold (I used Idaho potatoes, and it was fine)Salt and pepper Heat butter or fat in a large skillet (preferably cast iron) on medium heat.  Add the onion and cook a few minutes, until translucent.Mix in the chopped corned beef and potatoes.  Spread out evenly over the pan.  Increase the heat to high or medium high and press down on the mixture with a metal spatula. Do not stir the potatoes and corned beef, but let them brown.  If you hear them sizzling, this is good.  Use a metal spatula to peek underneath and see if they are browning.  If nicely browned, use the spatula to flip sections over in the pan so that they brown on the other side.  Press down again with the spatula.  If there is too much sticking, you can add a little more butter to the pan.  Continue to cook in this manner until the potatoes and the corned beef are nicely browned.Remove from heat, and add salt to taste.  Serve with fried or poached eggs for breakfast.So now I had all this leftover corned beef hash and thought, \"Why don't I try making pasties out of them?\"  No, not that kind of pasties, the Cornish kind.  They're kind of like empanadas or those beef curry turnovers, but from England.  When I visited a few years ago I tried them everywhere I could find them.  Not only are they quite tasty, but they're perfect for tourists because you can eat them on the run.  While doing some research about them, I found out that sometimes they had two internal pockets:  one savory and one sweet so it was like a two course meal in one!  I decided to just stick with the corned beef hash filling, though, and added some of the leftover cabbage as well.Corned Beef Hash Pastiesmakes 42 pie crustsLeftover corned beef hashLeftover boiled cabbage, diced1 egg yolkPreheat oven to 450°F.Roll out the pie crusts and cut out one 8\" circle in each, using a saucer or lid as a guide.  Re-roll the remaining dough out and cut out 2 more circles.Mix the corned beef hash and diced cabbage together.Fill each pie dough circle with about a 1/2 cup corned beef hash mixture.  Fold and crimp the edges to seal.  You can watch this video to see how I do it for the beef curry turnovers.In a small bowl, add a little water to the egg yolk and beat well.  Brush on the top of the pasties.  If you like, cut out a decoration with any leftover pie dough and adhere to the pasty using the egg wash.  I started with the heart and decided to put a diamond, spade, and club on the other 3.Bake in the oven for 18 minutes or until golden brown.There's something so yummy and filling about meat pies.  I think the pie crust really accentuates the savory fillings, kind of like how garlic bread really goes well with spaghetti.  Ooh, now there's a thought:  garlic butter brushed toaster pockets filled with spaghetti....  If only I still had my little toaster sandwich maker.....By the way, I'm headed up to Tremblant and Montreal this weekend.  Does anyone have any suggestions for what to do/where to eat?  I'm thinking L'Express for dinner, Juliette et Chocolat for dessert, and Eggspectations for brunch.  Sigh, unfortunately we'll only be spending 24 hours in Montreal...."},
{"title": "St. Patrick's Day Maki", "date": "Tuesday, March 17, 2009", "text": "So after I blogged about receiving cabbage in my bi-weekly Boston Organics delivery and asked what to do with it, I had multiple people suggest making corned beef and cabbage since St. Patrick's Day was coming up.  Well, I'm not really into boiled dinners (other than ramen, haha), but I did see this link on The Kitchn for corned beef and cabbage rolls and thought it was a cute idea.  The dipping sauce seemed a little difficult to make, however, compared to the ease of making the rolls so skipped that part and decided to add mashed potatoes inside the rolls instead so it would look more like a normal maki roll.St. Patrick's Day Maki (adapted from here)makes 24 rolls2 medium sized Idaho potatoes, peeled and cubed1/4 cup butter, cut into 4 pieces2 tablespoons milkSalt to taste1 medium size head of green cabbage1 1/2 lbs. cold corned beefAdd the cubed potatoes to a large pot and add enough cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil and cook for 15-20 minutes, until potatoes are soft when you insert a knife.Drain and transfer to a medium bowl.  Add butter and milk and mash until there are no lumps.  Salt to taste and set aside to cool.Start boiling a large pot of water. Gently peel off the cabbage leaves, keeping them whole.  In two batches, simmer the leaves for 8-10 minutes or until soft.  Transfer from the pot to an ice-water bath.  Pat the leaves dry and set aside.Slice the corned beef into long strips.Lay out a single cabbage leaf.  Spread mashed potatoes over the bottom 2 inches, and place 2-3 strips of corned beef in the middle of the potatoes.  Roll the cabbage leaf up tightly.  After all the leaves are rolled, cut into bite-sized pieces and serve.I found that the maki was flavorful enough not to need a dipping sauce, but I guess you can use a mustard or honey mustard if you really want.  I brought these to a party on Saturday and didn't get to ask anyone what they thought of them, but when I went back at the end of the night, they were all gone except for two pieces, so I assume people liked them.  =)  Happy St. Patrick's Day everyone!Next up:  What to do with leftover corned beef and potatoes:  Corned Beef Hash (and Pasties)!"},
{"title": "Duck Fat Potatoes", "date": "Monday, March 16, 2009", "text": "I had a wonderful weekend with a lot of cooking and baking but even more eating and drinking.  =)  Saturday morning, I went over to Jade's to have brunch with her and James.  We had been planning this for about two weeks now, and as we were deciding what we would each make and bring, I couldn't believe I had to wait so long for all that deliciousness!Jade made some crepes and had shaved dark chocolate, berries, sliced bananas, lemon juice, powdered sugar, and maple syrup as toppings.  James brought homemade blueberry scones with a limoncello glaze and made brown sugar bacon.I brought orange juice, eggs, the potatoes from Boston Organics, and my secret ingredient:  duck fat.I'd been reading for a while how good duck fat fries are, so the last couple of times I made duck, I'd been saving the drippings and harvesting the fat that solidifies on top.  It's a beautiful thing--almost pure white and apparently, it's healthier than butter!  You can store it in the freezer for months on end, and I only bring it out occasionally to make duck fat potatoes.I love potatoes and have tried making home fries in the past but were never 100% pleased with the results.  If you didn't add enough oil, they would invariably be almost burnt by the time they were cooked through, but if you add too much oil, it gets too greasy and neve really crispy.  By cooking home fries in duck fat, though, there is some magic that happens where they never get too greasy, turn just the perfect golden brown, and are always crispy on the outside and dry and fluffy on the inside, like a baked potato.  And the flavor!  It's so indescribably good, I won't even try. Duck Fat Potatoesserves 3 epicureans1.5 lbs. potatoes (red potatoes or Yukon golds work well)2-3 tablespoons duck fatSea salt to tasteWash and dice the potatoes.  I don't usually peel them, but you can if you prefer.  Place the diced potatoes in a bowl of cold, salted water.  This is to prevent them from oxidizing (turning brown), to add a little flavor, and also to try to leech out some starch, which would make the potatoes gummy vs. crispy.  Drain well after 5 minutes.Heat a large skillet on high and add the duck fat.  Once the pan and fat are very hot, add the potatoes and form a single layer.  Sprinkle some salt on top and stir every few minutes so that all sides of the potatoes are browned.  You could also add a lot more fat so that the potatoes are immersed and essentially deep frying, but I like to hoard my duck fat.Add more salt to taste if necessary and serve hot.  If there is any leftover fat in the pan, you can use it to make scrambled eggs, which is what we did, and boy were those heavenly as well.Next up:  St. Patrick's Day Maki"},
{"title": "Panna Cotta, Take 3", "date": "Friday, March 13, 2009", "text": "Okay, I think I have finally achieved the perfect consistency after two tries.  I basically followed the same recipe as before, but this time I tried orange flavored panna cotta instead of almond, and I only had half-and-half and no cream so I adjusted the ratio a bit.Orange Panna Cotta (based on this recipe)makes 6 small servings2 cups half-and-half1 cup heavy cream1 1/4 cups granulated sugar, dividedZest from 1 medium orange1 teaspoon orange extract1 tablespoon powdered unflavored gelatin bloomed in 3 tablespoons water1 red navel orange (or any other kind of orange that doesn't segment well; I would not recommend mandarins for example)1 cup freshly squeezed orange juiceIn a small saucepan over medium-high, combine half-and-half, milk, zest, and 3/4 cups sugar; bring to a boil.  Stir in the orange extract.  Remove from heat, and let stand for 20 minutes.Cut the orange horizontally (along the latitudinal planes) so that you have 6 circular slices that will fit into the ramekins you are using.Microwave the gelatin and water for 8 seconds.  Add a ladleful or two of the warm half-and-half mixture to the gelatin and gently stir until all lumps are gone.  Add to the rest of the half-and-half mixture.  Pass the mixture through a sieve and divide evenly among 6 small ramekins or other servings dishes.  Carefully add the orange slices so that they are floating on top.  Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours.In a small saucepan, boil the orange juice and remaining 1/2 cup sugar until the sugar is dissolved.  Let cool.Once the panna cotta has set, pour the orange syrup on top and serve.I think because I added the warm mixture to the gelatin to dissove it before adding it to the rest of the mixture, it really helped to distribute the gelatin.  I definitely noticed a lot less gelatinous lumps in the sieve this time, and as a result, the texture of the panna cotta was perfect--neither too soft or too firm.  On the other hand, I realize I like the almond flavored ones better, so if I ever make this again, I know what I'll stick with.I had originally wanted the orange slices to sit on the bottom of the ramekin so that after the panna cotta had set, I could flip it upside-down and serve it with the orange slice on top.  But the slices ended up floating when I added the panna cotta mixture so I had to scrap that idea.  That's also the reason why you can see some milkiness on top of the orange slice and why the circumference of the slice I chose was a lot smaller than the mouth of the ramekin.  And by the way, how are people able to unmold the panna cotta anyways?  I tried running a knife along the edge, but it didn't work very well; you could see the knife marks along the edge and the top (or bottom, depending on how you look at it) was all sunk in afterwards.  Maybe I need to run some hot water on the outside first to \"melt\" the edges a bit....I didn't take any pictures of how it looked with the orange syrup because by the time it had cooled the light sucked, and anyways, I like the look without the syrup because you can clearly see the pure white of the panna cotta and the little orange slice floating on top like a lily pad.  Too bad you can't really eat the orange slice as is because of the rind.  I suppose if I had had the time, I could have candied the slices so that they could be eaten as is.  Perhaps next time...."},

{"title": "Warm Tofu with Spicy Garlic Sauce", "date": "Tuesday, March 10, 2009", "text": "So the answer to the previous post is that the mix won.  Surprised?  I kind of wasn't.  There's a reason Korean moms use the mix, and I'm not one to argue with them....Another Korean dish I made recently (although it's from the March 2009 issue of Gourmet, so I don't know how authentic it is) was warm tofu with spicy garlic sauce.  It's one of those incredibly easy (so easy I barely consider it cooking) but so good recipes.  My mom makes something similar except it's cold silken tofu with soy sauce, sugar, scallions, and bonito flakes on top.  Sometimes she adds thousand year eggs, too, but I don't really care for them.  Anyways, this warm version should tide me through the rest of the Boston winter.  Only 28 more days until Opening Day!Warm Tofu with Spicy Garlic Sauce (based on this recipe)makes an appetizer for 2-3 people or a light meal for 11 (12 oz.) package firm silken tofu1 teaspoon chopped garlic1/4 cup chopped scallion2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds3 tablespoons soy sauce1 tablespoon sesame oil1 teaspoon coarse hot red-pepper flakes1/2 teaspoon sugarCarefully rinse tofu, then cover with cold water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then keep warm, covered, over very low heat.   Meanwhile, mince and mash garlic to a paste with a pinch of salt.  Stir together with remaining ingredients (except tofu).Just before serving, carefully lift tofu from saucepan with a large spatula, drain, and transfer to a small plate.  Spoon some sauce over tofu and serve warm.The original recipe called for soft, not silken tofu, but all I had was firm silken tofu, and it worked just fine, although you have to be extra careful when transferring it.  I prefer the texture of silken tofu for this dish anyways, probably because it reminds me of my mom's dish.  I also ended up estimating the measurements for all the ingredients for the sauce.  I definitely didn't have a quarter cup of chopped scallions as I recently harvested almost all my scallions for the Peking duck.  And I just realized that I forgot to crush the sesame seeds with the side of a heavy knife.  Oh well, it was still delicious anyways.  ^_^    Before and after"},
{"title": "Korean Pancake Face-Off", "date": "Monday, March 9, 2009", "text": "As much as I love the traditional Chinese scallion pancakes, I have to admit, I love Korean pancakes (pa jeon or pajung or whatever) even more.  I love how they're so moist on the inside but still super crispy on the outside.  And even better, it's a great way to get rid of leftovers, which I really appreciate because some weeks I have a lot of leftover hot pot ingredients that I need to get rid of.The only problem is, every time I ask a Korean how to make this from scratch, they just tell me that their moms make it from the mix.  Seriously?  I can't think of a single thing that my mom makes that uses a mix!  Fortunately, I live close enough to several Korean grocery stores and can pick up the mix, which does deliver an almost no-fail pancake every time.Looking at the list of ingredients, though (wheat flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, MSG), it just seems incredible that it can't be replicated from scratch.  I've tried both David Lebovitz's and the New York Times versions, but they both couldn't compare to the mix.  The last week I saw this post on The Kitchn.  Could it be that I finally found a recipe that could replicate or even supersede the mix?It seemed likely.  Not only did this recipe include rice flour, which I always assumed was used in pa jeon because of the light, moist texture, but it also used seltzer water to add airiness to the batter.  So I decided to have a side-by-side comparison of the two pancakes.  The ground rules:I used the same filling for both:  scallions, diced and sweated bok choy stems, sliced fish cake, marinated and sauteed beef, sliced and sauteed Chinese sausage.I would use the same non-stick pan and the same amount of oil (exactly 2 tablespoons of canola) for each.I would cook both the same way:  4 minutes on each side at medium heat.Homemade Korean Pancake from Scratch (based on this recipe)makes 1 big pancake1.2 cup all purpose flour1/2 cup rice flour1 egg, lightly beaten3/4 cups cold unflavored seltzer water1/2 tablespoon canola oil, plus extra for the panIn a large bowl, gently mix flours, eggs, seltzer, and oil until smooth.  Let rest a few minutes and then stir in filling, tossing to coat.Heat a large frying pan over medium heat and coat with 2 tablespoons of canola oil.  When pan is hot, add batter and spread out so it's no more than a half-inch thick.  Turn heat down to medium-low.Cook about 4 minutes, flipping when pancake no longer resists, then cook about 4 minutes on the other side.  Pancake should be crispy and brown, with no liquid inside.As you can see from the pictures, I had a hard time flipping the pancake over in one piece, but that's due to user error and not one of the criteria for this contest.Korean Pancake Mix (from the back of the bag)makes 1 big pancake1 cup Korean pancake mix3/4 cups waterIn a large bowl, mix mix and water until there are no lumps.  Add filling, mixing to coat.Heat a large frying pan over medium heat and coat with 2 tablespoons of canola oil.  When pan is hot, add batter and spread out so it's no more than a half-inch thick.  Turn heat down to medium-low.Cook about 4 minutes, flipping when pancake no longer resists, then cook about 4 minutes on the other side.The batter for the mix version was definitely a lot drier due to the fact that there was no egg or oil added, and you definitely had to \"push\" the batter around in the pan to get it to an even thickness.  And once again, I tore the pancake in two trying to flip it over.  So I guess both versions are even there.  =PFor the dipping sauce, I mixed equal portions of rice wine vinegar and aged soy sauce and added a splash of sesame oil and a pinch of sugar.Side-by-SideComparing the two, all testers found that one was definitely more moist and generally had a preferable texture (less dense) to the other.  Otherwise, there didn't seem to be too much of a difference in flavor, although Jenny did mention that because we were using a dipping sauce, just about anything would've tasted the same.Can you guess which version won the taste test?

{"title": "Panna Cotta, Take 2", "date": "Thursday, March 5, 2009", "text": "This is my second attempt at a panna cotta version of the traditional Chinese dessert, almond tofu.  As you may recall, last time the major issue was that the panna cotta barely jelled.  As a minor issue, I didn't like the way the white wine reduction turned out because I had been hoping the dried cherries would have pureed more to thicken the reduction.  Instead it ended up being a muddy reddish-brownish liquid that the pears ended up being immersed in on top of the panna cotta.  Not terribly pretty to look at, but fortunately still rather tasty.I basically used the same recipe as before, except I only had 1 1/3 cups milk and a little more than 1 cup of heavy cream.  Since my issue last time was that the panna cotta didn't set enough, I figured I'd try using the same 1 tablespoon of gelatin and hope it wouldn't get too hard.  And after seeing Tartelette's beautiful panna cottas, I figured I'd try something a little different for the pears.Red Wine Poached Pears Pureemakes enough for 6 panna cotta servings1/2 vanilla beanZest from one orange1 cup red wine (it was all I had left)1/2 cup sugar2 D'anjou pearsSplit the vanilla bean lengthwise in half with a knife and scrape out the seeds.Add the vanilla seeds and pod and orange zest to the red wine and sugar in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Reduce to a simmer.Peel the pears, leaving the stem intact.  Slice off the bottom 1/8\" of each pear to create a flat, stable base.Add the pears to the simmering poaching liquid, laying them on their sides. Cook, turning pears occasionally so they become saturated on all sides, until they are just tender when pierced with a fork, about 7 minutes.Allow pears to cool completely in their poaching liquid.After the pears have cooled, remove the core and stem and roughly chop the pear.  Add just enough braising liquid to cover and let sit until the pear reaches the desired color.  (I only gave it about 15 minutes.)  Drain as much of the liquid as possible and reserve.Using an immersion blender or regular blender, puree the pears.To assemble the panna cotta, I divided the pear puree equally between 6 ramekins (oh what I wouldn't give for the cute glasses that Tartelette uses!).Carefully pour the panna cotta mixture (after the gelatin has been added to it) through a sieve on top of the puree.  I was not so careful on my first attempt and pretty much lost the bottom layer.The other ramekins fared a little better.There was still some of the puree that ended up floating on top of the panna cotta mixture, but I wasn't too worried because there was going to be a third layer.  But before that, let the panna cotta sit in the fridge for at least 3 hours, until firm.  In the meantime, heat the red wine braising liquid (you didn't throw it out, did you?) in a small saucepan and reduce to about 1/3 cup volume.Once the panna cotta has set, spoon the wine reduction on top.  For a final touch, place a peeled mandarin orange section on top as garnish.I found that this time the panna cotta was actually a little firmer than I wanted.  I also noticed that when I was straining the mixture into the ramekins that there was a fair amount of gelatin left in the strainer.  According to Tartelette's recipe, she strains the mixture before adding the gelatin, so maybe the first time I made the recipe the reason it wasn't set enough was because I was leaving too much gelatin in the strainer.  At the same time, I don't really want heterogeneous bits of hard gelatin settling at the bottom of the panna cotta.  I guess next time I make this (yes, there will be a next time!) I will try dissolving the gelatin in a bit of reheated cream mixture before adding it to the rest of the cooled mixture."},
{"title": "French Red Onion Soup", "date": "Tuesday, March 3, 2009", "text": "My first encounter with French onion soup came after my family had moved to Ohio when I was 13.  We were staying at a hotel until we could find more permanent housing, and as a treat, my parents chose to eat at the hotel restaurant for dinner.  Back then, going to McDonald's was still a special thing for me, so this was probably the first sit-down meal I had where a waiter served me and everything.  My mom ordered the French onion soup, and when she let me try some, it was love at first bite.  The melty, salty cheese and not yet soggy bread crouton floating on top of the beef broth and sweet onions was the undoing of me.  If such a thing existed in this world, then I was all the more glad to be living in it.Fast forward to my undergrad days at Cornell.  At the Ivy Room, one of the a la carte dining halls, they served French onion soup every day.  Of course, being on meal plan, it didn't really make sense for me to be eating there because I could have been getting all-you-can-eat at Oakenshields next door, but that didn't stop me from going to the Ivy and getting my favorite soup at least once a week.  Unfortunately, by my junior year, they had stopped serving it there, although they had started making paninis, which is how I had my first Cubano, but that's another story for another day.I've never made French onion soup myself because the usual recipes call for beef broth, baguette bread, and cheese, which are 3 ingredients I don't usually have in my fridge or pantry.  But then I ended up with 2 red onions from Boston Organics which I didn't know what to do with and in the same week, came across this recipe for French red onion soup from the September 2008 issue of Gourmet, which uses chicken broth instead of beef broth.  I already had all the ingredients except for the baguette and Gruyere, but I figured just this one time I could shell out for them, and boy, am I glad I did.French Red Onion Soup (based on this recipe)makes 4 servings 2 cups homemade chicken stock2 cups water2 whole star anise6  black peppercorns2  lbs. red onions, cut into 1/2-inch wedges3 tablespoons olive oil1/2 cup dry red wine4 (1-inch-thick) slices of baguette2 cups coarsely grated Manchego or Gruyère (6 to 7 oz)Bring broth, water, spices, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a boil.  Remove from heat and let steep 15 minutes.Meanwhile, cook onions in oil with 1/4 teaspoon salt in a heavy medium pot over medium heat, covered, stirring occasionally, until deep golden, about 15 minutes.  Add wine and boil, uncovered, until reduced to 2 tablespoons, about 1 minute.  Strain broth through a sieve into onion mixture and briskly simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes. Season with salt.Preheat broiler.Ladle soup into 4 ovenproof bowls set in a 4-sided sheet pan.  Place baguette slices on top and sprinkle each with 1/2 cup cheese.  Broil about 6 inches from heat until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 2 minutes.I wish I had oven-proof bowls that were closer in diameter to the size of the baguette slice for aesthetic purposes.  For gastromic purposes, it didn't really matter as the cheese that melted on top of the soup stayed nice and melty while the cheese on top of the bread protected it from getting too soggy.  This particular recipe had a bit more onions in the soup than I prefer, but the taste of the soup itself was sublime.  I couldn't even tell that it came from a chicken stock and not a beef broth, that's how much depth and body the caramelized onions, spices, and reduced red wine gave the soup."},
{"title": "Potato Leek Soup with Bacon", "date": "Monday, March 2, 2009", "text": "When I was a college student living in a apartment with 3 other girls and a tiny kitchen and a small, small budget, I loved going to Costco and getting a big tin of Bear Creek Creamy Potato Soup.  It was delicious by itself, but once you added some cheese, broccoli, corn, or bacon, it became awesome.  And because it came in powder form, you didn't have to worry about it going bad if you didn't end up cooking for a while.Now that I'm grown up and getting potatoes from Boston Organics, I figure it was time to learn how to make a potato soup from scratch, especially after reading the ingredients of the powdered soup:  Dehydrated Potatoes, Food Starch-modified Corn Starch Solids, Sweet Whey, Partially Hydrogenated Canola, Cottonseed, and Soybean Oil, Onions, Salt, Monosodium Glutamate, Sodium Caseinate (Milk Protein), Titanium Dioxide Color, Maltodextrin, Disodium Inosinate and Sodium Guanylate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Autolyzed Yeast Extract, Spices, Parsley, Dry Sherry Wine, Garlic Natural and Artificial Flavoring, Chicken Broth Arabic Gum, Rendered Chicken Fat, Casein (Milk Protein), Citric Acid, Silicon Dioxide, Yellow No. 5, Mono and Diglycerides, Annatto Color.Scary.This recipe from The Kitchn, on the other hand, only has 2 ingredients.  Well, 4, if you add bacon and substitute homemade chicken stock for water.  And 5, if you count salt.  (I don't like pepper, so it doesn't count.)  Take that, Bear Creek!Potato Leek Soup with Bacon (based on this recipe)makes 4 servings5 cups peeled and cubed potatoes2 1/2 cups sliced leeks3-4 slices bacon1 quart homemade chicken stock (or water)Wash the leeks very, very well.  Leeks are notorious for having a lot of dirt and sand in between layers.  Drain and set aside.In a large saucepan, brown bacon until crisp.  Remove bacon and let drain on some paper towels.Saute the leeks in the hot bacon fat left in the pan until wilted.  Add potatoes and toss to coat.  Add chicken broth to cover, about 1 quart.  Bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer until potatoes are soft and cooked through, about 30 minutes.With an immersion blender, or very carefully in batches in a food processor, or even with a potato masher and your own brute strength, blend until the mixture reaches the consistency you prefer.Salt and pepper to taste.  Serve hot with crumbled bacon, grated cheese, and chopped scallions on top, if you prefer.Other variations:  Add chopped broccoli stems at the same time you add the potatoes.  Add fresh or frozen corn kernels after blending the soup and heat through.  Top with sour cream or creme fraiche.I found that the soup needed a lot more salt than I thought it would, but otherwise I was very pleased with the result, especially since I was able to get a nice, creamy consistency without needing any dairy products.  Adding the fresh, chopped scallions also brings out an unexpected vibrancy to the soup."},
{"title": "Homemade Chicken Stock", "date": "Saturday, February 28, 2009", "text": "The basis for any soup is a good stock, which is really so simple to make that there's no reason to ever use the canned kind.  I used two great tips from thekitchn.com to make my latest batch:1.  Save vegetable scraps for stock.  I had some leftover celery and carrots from making the clam chowda and extra onion left from making roast chicken which I threw in a freezer bag until I was ready to make the stock.2.  Use the pasta strainer insert.  A great way to remove the carcass and vegetables after the stock is done without having to awkwardly dump everything into a strainer.  You still have to strain the stock, but it's a lot easier without the huge carcass in the way.Homemade Chicken Stock (based on this recipe)makes 6 quartsChicken carcass or 4 chicken breast carcasses (preferably with a little meat left on it)A handful or two each of onions, carrots, and celeryBay leafPeppercornsGarlic clovesPull apart whatever is left of the chicken carcass.  It's good to split small bones apart; this helps the stock jell.  Cut up one or two onions, a few stalks of celery, and a couple carrots and pile into the pasta insert of a large pot with the chicken pieces.  Add a bay leaf, a few peppercorns, a couple of garlic cloves, and any other wilting greens you have around - leeks and turnips are good too.Fill the pot with water, cover, and put over high heat. Bring to a rolling boil then lower the heat.  You don't want this to boil briskly; the water should just gurgle, with a few bubbles occasionally hitting the surface. If a foamy muck comes to the top, skim it off. This is just fat rising to the surface. Don't worry if you can't get all of it.  Let simmer for about four hours - or however long you have.  Two hours will produce a reasonably good chicken stock, although it is not ideal.Once the stock is done, remove from heat.  Remove the pasta insert and drain.  Carefully ladle stock through a sieve into storage containers, pouring it out once it is at a manageable volume.If it is cold outside, set the containers of stock outside to chill; otherwise, let cool to room temperature and then transfer to refrigerator to chill.Once it has chilled, skim off the fat from the top of the stock.  The stock will keep in the fridge for a few days and in the freezer for a few months.If you don't feel like your stock has enough body, you can reduce it in volume by boiling it until you get it to where you want it.  Whatever you do, do not add salt to your stock.  That should be done when you are making your soup; you can always add salt to a soup but there's no way to save an over-salted soup.Next up:  Potato Leek Soup with Bacon"},
{"title": "Gourmet Magazine, March 2009", "date": "Friday, February 27, 2009", "text": "I usually feel lucky if I can tear out more than one recipe to try from an issue of Gourmet or Bon Appetit, but I found so many recipes from the most recent Gourmet magazine that I just had to share.First of all, the cover has a picture of the Monte Cubano sandwich, a \"two-in-one induglgence [that] has the irresistible makings of a Cuban sandwich, including Swiss cheese, pickles, and sliced meets--but it's also dipped in egg batter and fried like a Monte Cristo.\"  Strangely enough, my cover (a mailed subscription) is different from the one on the website in that mine just has the picture and the words \"Gourmet, The Magazine of Good Living\", the date, and the price.  I guess you want to have a hint of what's inside for the issues on the newstands.On page 4 is a recipe for Key Lime Coconut Cake and page 17 has a recipe for Key Lime Pie, one of my most favoritest desserts ever.  Page 47 has Panfried Smashed Potatoes, \"crisp-skinned yet pillowy [potatoes], sprinkled with a generous amount of salty parmesan\" and on page 49 you have Chocolate Raspberry Calfoutis, \"somewhere between custard and cake...a simple French country dessert.\"Then starting on page 68 you've got a whole article on Korean food with Soy-Pickled Jalapenos, Warm Tofu with Spicy Garlic Sauce, Shrimp and Scallion Pancakes, and Mandarin Orange Ice Cream with Sesame Brittle.Finally, two recipes for roast chicken, Glazed Chicken with Porcini and Crisp Potatoes on page 86 and Roast Chicken with Pan Gravy on page 98, and a recipe for how to use the carcasses to make Leftover-Roast-Chicken Stock.Surfing around on their web page I found a video for how to carve a whole roast chicken (a skill I should really learn) and a recipe for Coconut Panna Cotta that would use up the leftover coconut flakes from the Key Lime Coconut Cake.Yay, I can't wait to start trying these recipes!"},
{"title": "Panna Cotta, Take 1", "date": "Thursday, February 26, 2009", "text": "I think I had panna cotta for the first time 2 years ago when Karen made it for the Soul Food volunteers training dinner.  She had made an orange version, and I couldn't stop consuming it.  It was perfectly creamy, sweet, and tangy, and the texture was similar to tofu pudding--the silkiest, softest phase something could be while still remaining a solid.  I've been meaning to make it ever since but never got around to it until this week.I'd been playing around with the idea of makind an almond-flavored panna cotta, kind of like an upscale version of almond tofu.  And instead of fruit cocktail, I'd add poached pears.  This was my first time making both, so I did a little research.  I did ask Karen for her panna cotta recipe, but it didn't say how many it served (I should have just asked her) so I tried this one instead.  Since I wanted to serve 6, I multiplied the ingredients by 1.5, although I did end up adding a full teaspoon of almond extract because when I tasted the mixture with only 3/4 teaspoons it didn't have as much almond flavor as I wanted it to have.Almond Panna Cotta (based on this recipe)makes 6 small servings1 1/2 cups whole milk1 1/2 cups heavy cream3/4 cups granulated sugar1 teaspoon almond extract1 tablespoon powdered unflavored gelatin bloomed in 3 tablespoons waterIn a small saucepan over medium-high, combine milk, cream, and sugar; bring to a boil. Stir in the almond extract. Remove from heat, and let stand for 20 minutes.Microwave the gelatin and water for 8 seconds and stir it in the cream mixture.  Pass the mixture through a sieve and divide evenly among 6 small ramekins or other servings dishes.  Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours.Even after chilling the it overnight, the panna cotta still looked suspiciously jiggly, and it was definitely softer than I wanted it.  I'm not sure if the answer is to add more gelatin because I don't really want the stiffness that's associated with Jell-O Jigglers.  I think next time I make this I will try boiling the milk and cream mixture longer to reduce it a bit as instructed in Karen's recipe.For the pears I found these two recipes for vanilla poached pears which were pretty different from each other, so I decided to try a amalgam of the two.  I also wanted to add cherries, but the only ones I could find were dried, tart cherries, so I tried to reconstitute them in the poaching liquid, which didn't work too well.Vanilla Poached Pears with Dried Cherriesmakes 2 pears1/2 vanilla bean2 cups white wine1/2 cup water1 cup sugar2 Bosc pears12 dried tart cherriesSplit the vanilla bean lengthwise in half with a knife and scrape out the seeds. Add the vanilla seeds and pod to the white wine, water, and sugar in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Reduce to a simmer.Peel the pears, leaving the stem intact. Slice off the bottom 1/8\" of each pear to create a flat, stable base.Add the pears to the simmering poaching liquid, laying them on their sides so they are almost completely submerged.  Cook, turning pears occasionally so they become saturated on all sides, until they are just tender when pierced with a fork, about 7 minutes.Allow pears to cool completely in their poaching liquid.  Add dried cherries to the poaching liquid.Once cool, transfer 1 cup of poaching liquid plus cherries to a small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the liquid.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.  Use an immersion blender to (try to) puree the cherries.  Strain and set aside.Cut each pear into thirds lengthwise, removing the core.  Make vertical cuts into each section so you get very thin slices.  Fan the slices out and carefully transfer to the top of panna cotta.  Drizzle with cherry liquid mixture.As you can probably tell from the pictures above, my attempts at incorporating the cherries into the poaching liquid did not turn out too well.  And because the panna cotta was so soft, the pears kind of sank into it instead of nicely resting on top.  But I really liked the taste of the whole dish.  The almond was definitely noticeable in the panna cotta, and the texture of the pears was akin to the canned pears in fruit cocktail but the flavor was a whole lot more sophisticated.  Definitely a recipe I want to try again and perfect."},
{"title": "Boston Organics, Week 2", "date": "Wednesday, February 25, 2009", "text": "So it's been 2 weeks since I got my first delivery from Boston Organics, and I think I've done pretty well.  I used the Swiss chard and mushrooms in hot pot last week, added the broccoli stems to fried rice and florets to roast chicken, used the potatoes in clam chowder, lemons in lemon bars, and avocado in avocado ice cream, braised the collard greens with bacon, poached the pears, and ate the rest of the fruits.  One banana was pretty brown by the time I got to it so I peeled it and froze it so I can use it for banana bread in the future.  And I have 2 red onions left which I'm thinking about using to make French onion soup.  Luckily, onions keep for a bit.click on the picture to see what everything isThis week I received 1 rio star grapefruit, 2 royal mandarin oranges, 2 pink lady apples, 2 minneola tangelos, 2 red navel oranges, 2 anjou pears, 4 bananas, 1 bunch broccoli, 1 salad tomato, 1.5 lbs. yukon potatoes, 1 box white mushrooms, 1 bunch kale, 1 bunch scallions (yeah, I forgot to add them to the picture because I had already put them in water), and 1 box Munchin' Mix sprouts.So I can make eggs and tomato over rice with the tomato and scallions, add the mushrooms and kale to hot pot next week, stir-fry or roast the broccoli again, eat the fruit, and maybe make some gnocchi with the potatoes (or more duck fat potatoes, yay!).  But what da heck do I do with the sprouts?  They're not real bean sprouts (which I love) but just sprouted adzuki beans, lentils, and peas.  Any ideas?"},
{"title": "Wok-Fried Edamame with Garlic", "date": "Monday, February 23, 2009", "text": "I've been getting Gourmet and Bon Appetit for a couple of months now and try to always rip out at least one recipe from each issue that I would like to try.  And since I'm usually reading these magazines in bed, I'll just add them to my growing collection of recipes that I have on my wall, stuck there with a single thumbtack.  Not exactly the most aesthetically pleasing of decorations, but it means I see them at least twice a day; reminders that I should be trying them out.  I've had this one stuck up there for weeks and finally tried it this past week.  And it's probably a good thing I've waited so long because it is absolutely addicting.  I'm sure if I had made them sooner I'd be waist deep in edamame shells by now because I.  Just.  Can't.  Stop.  Eating.  Them.  I love eating edamame just boiled in salt water, but these...these are a higher species of edamame.  The soy sauce and oyster sauce add a depth of umami, the hot sesame oil brings just enough kick to transcend the saltiness, and the garlic makes this dish deeply satisfying yet keeps you wanting more (yes, I realize that doesn't really make sense, but it's true).I get my edamame frozen from Trader Joe's.  And if you don't have hot sesame oil, you can use regular sesame oil and add one minced, seeded jalepeno pepper.  The original recipe also called for 2 teaspoons of minced fresh ginger, but I don't like ginger that much so I omitted it from mine.Wok-Fried Edamame with Garlic (based on Alan Wong's recipe from December 2008 issue in the R.S.V.P. section)6 to 8 appetizer servings1 lb. unshelled fresh or frozen edamame (soybeans)2 tablespoons soy sauce2 teaspoons oyster sauce1 teaspoon hot sesame oil (spicy hot, not temperature hot)2 teaspoons peanut oil2 garlic cloves, mincedBring 4 cups of water to a boil and add edamame.  Once the water is boiling again, cook for 5 minutes or until tender.  Drain and transfer edamame to a bowl of ice water to cool.  Drain and pat dry or use a salad spinner to dry.  Set aside.Mix together soy sauce, oyster sauce, and hot sesame oil in a small bowl.  Set aside.Heat peanut oil in a heavy large work or skillet over medium-high heat.  Add garlic; saute until beginning to brown, about 1 minute.  Add edamame and stir to heat through, about 2 minutes.  Add soy sauce mixture; stir 1 minute to coat evenly and heat through.  Transfer to platter and serve.To eat the edamame I pick it up from the stem end, put the other end in my mouth, and squeeze the beans out, sucking off the sauce and garlic as I pull the shell out.  It can be a little messy, so make sure you have something to put the discarded shells in and a napkin to wipe your fingers with afterwards."},
{"title": "One Avocado Ice Cream", "date": "Friday, February 20, 2009", "text": "Remember that lone avocado from my Boston Organics delivery last week?So for the longest time I thought I was allergic to avocados.  I think I tried some for the first time in my early teens (my mom was making California rolls) and my stomach didn't take too kindly to it so I avoided it for years to come.  Then I think I tried guacamole once and got addicted and realized my tummy was fine so I realized I wasn't allergic!  Come to think of it, the only (other) allergic reactions I've ever gotten were hives after eating a spider roll (twice), although when I eat other sushi rolls and soft shell crab on its own I don't break out.  And I've definitely eaten spider rolls at other times without breaking out too.But back to this avocado.  I saw avocado ice cream once at this gelato place between Chinatown and North Beach in SF and thought the idea was intriguing but went for the lychee ice cream instead.  But now that I had my own avocado with which I could do anything I wanted to, I figured it was time to make some avocado ice cream.A quick google gave me Alton Brown's recipe, and I *always* trust Alton Brown.  That guy knows what he's talking about.  One Avocado Ice Cream (based on this recipe)makes a little over 1 pint1 ripe avocado1 teaspoon lemon juice1/2 cup milk2 heaping tablespoons sugar1/3 cup heavy creamCut the avocado in half lengthwise, cutting around the pit.  Split in half, discard the pit, and scoop out the avocado meat.Add the avocado meat, lemon juice, milk, and sugar to a blender and puree. Transfer the mixture to a medium mixing bowl, add the heavy cream, and whisk to combine.  Place the mixture into the refrigerator and chill until it reaches 40 °F or below, approximately 4 to 6 hours. Process the mixture in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions.  However, this mixture sets up very fast, so count on it taking only 5 to 10 minutes to process.  For soft ice cream, serve immediately.  If desired, place in freezer for 3 to 4 hours for firmer texture. When I tasted the unfrozen mixture, I understood for the first time that the avocado is a fruit.  The sugar and squeeze of lemon juice gave the avocado a tanginess similar to that of the kiwi but without the sharp acidity of that other green fruit.  And the texture, oh my, the creaminess....  It was creamier than any ice cream I'd ever tried; it was basically like eating a very, very cold avocado without any iciness involved.  Words fail to describe it.  You'll simply have to try it for yourself because this recipe only made enough for me.  ^_^"},
{"title": "Boston Cream Cupcakes", "date": "Wednesday, February 18, 2009", "text": "Going with the theme of \"Boston\" food for Leslie's goodbye party, I made cupcake versions of a Boston cream pie.  Most people are probably more familiar with Dunkin' Donuts' Boston Kreme donut and they're pretty similar:  a sponge cake (or donut) filled with vanilla custard and topped with a chocolate glaze.  Martha Stewart featured a really nice looking Boston cream cupcake in her March issue of Living, but it was a little too authentic to be party-friendly.  She actually bakes the cupcakes without a liner, cuts them in half, and sandwiches the vanilla custard in between the layers.  I figured it'd be a lot easier to eat a cupcake that had the custard piped into it then to try to deal with a cupcake/custard \"sandwich\" so I used this recipe to make the cupcakes.Boston Cream Cupcakes (based on this recipe)makes 48 cupcakes2 boxes of butter yellow cake mix1 (3 oz.) box French vanilla instant pudding1 cup half & half1 3/4 cups heavy cream, divided2 teaspoons vanilla extract1/4 cup powdered sugar1 (11.5 oz.) bag semi-sweet chocolate chips24 maraschino cherriesPrepare yellow cupcakes as directed and allow to cool completely.In the meantime, prepare the vanilla custard filling by combining the instant pudding with the half & half in a medium bowl. Whip 1 cup of heavy cream, vanilla, and powdered sugar on medium speed until you get soft peaks.  Gently fold in pudding mixture into the whipped cream until fully incorporated.Place filling into a piping bag or makeshift Ziploc bag, fitted with a coupler and a #21 tip.When cupcakes have cooled, place tip inside the center of each cupcake and pipe in filling, being careful not to overfill.Melt the chocolate chips in the remaining 3/4 cups heavy cream over a double boiler (or a bowl fitted on top of a pot of boiling water).  Stir until completely melted and homogeneous.Dip only the tops of the cupcakes in the chocolate ganache.  If the top of the cupcake doesn't clear the top of the cupcake liner, you'll want to spread the ganache on using a small butter knife or spatula.Drain maraschino cherries and cut in half.  While cupcakes are still slightly \"wet\" from the glaze, place half a cherry on top to garnish.I made only half the amount of the vanilla custard filling for this many cupcakes but still had a ton left over afterwards as well as some extra chocolate ganache.  Instead of tossing it, I tried folding them together and ended up making a chocolate mousse!After I took this picture I actually chopped up all my extra maraschino cherries (I think I had about 8 left over) and folded them in as well.  The mousse is so freaking rich that it needs the fruit (even one as artificial as a maraschino cherry) to cut the fat a little."},
{"title": "New England Clam Chowda and Homemade Oyster Crackers", "date": "Tuesday, February 17, 2009", "text": "That should really be a sad face because Leslie is gone =(My dear cousin and roommate, Leslie, moved out yesterday after 3.5 years of living together, so we threw a goodbye and birthday party for her on Sunday night.  Annie and I came up with a theme of \"Boston\" for food so I made some New England clam chowder (\"chowda\" around these here parts) and oyster crackers.  This was my first time making it, but I used a highly rated recipe on allrecipes.com for the chowder, and I think it turned out pretty good (at least, better than Campbells).  The oyster crackers were more of an afterthought; I realized that it would be good to serve the chowder with oyster crackers but was too lazy to go to the store to get them so I figured I'd just make them myself.  And now that I think about it, that's a pretty warped sense of laziness.  Oh well.I almost always go to allrecipes.com if there's something I want to make that I don't have a recipe for.  I like the website because you can be assured that the recipes are good by looking for the ones that have tons of reviews and read the comments to catch any useful tips.  For example, when I searched for clam chowder on the site, there were 43 returns, but only a few had more than a handful of comments, a couple had at least a hundred, and only one had 440.  So of course I chose to use that recipe.  And skimming through the comments gave me the idea to add bacon to the chowder to make it even more flavorful.Bye Bye Leslie Clam Chowda (based on this recipe)makes 16 servings (or feeds a party of 70+ people)6 strips bacon6 (6.5 oz.) cans minced clams2 cups minced yellow onion2 cups diced celery4 cups cubed potatoes2 cup diced carrots1 1/2 cups butter1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour2 quarts half-and-half4 tablespoons red wine vinegar1 tablespoon salt (if you don't have salt you can just cry into the chowda because Leslie is leaving)Ground black pepper to tasteBrown bacon in a large stock pot until crisp.  Remove bacon and set aside.  Add onions, celery, potatoes, and carrots to bacon fat and toss.  Drain juice from clams and add to vegetables.  Add enough water to cover and cook over medium-high heat until tender.Meanwhile, in a large, heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Whisk in flour until smooth.  Whisk in cream and stir constantly until thick and smooth.  Add to the vegetables and clam juice.  Heat through but do not boil.Crumble the bacon and stir in with clams just before serving.  (If the clams cook too much they get tough.)  When clams are heated through, stir in vinegar and season with salt and pepper.  Serve hot with oyster crackers.I found the oyster cracker recipe using google.  There were a couple of other recipes that used yeast and shortening, but I decided to keep it simple and use this one that uses butter.  I considered briefly using bacon fat or duck fat, but then I decided I wanted my guests to go home alive.  =PHomemade Oyster Crackers (based on this recipe)makes about 2 cups2 cups all-purpose flour1 tablespoon baking powder1 teaspoon sea salt4 oz. unsalted butter, diced4 oz. whole milkSea salt for garnish Preheat your oven to 375 °F.Combine all dry ingredients in food processor.  Add butter and pulse quickly, until it looks like \"coarse meal\".  Add the milk and process 3 seconds.  Remove to floured surface, knead 10 seconds and chill the dough.Divide the dough into quarters, and working with one quarter at a time (leaving the rest chilling in the refrigerator), roll the dough out to 1/8\" thickness and sprinkle with salt.  Using a fork, prick the dough all over.  Cut with the crackers into any desired shape using a sharp knife or small cookie cutter.Place the crackers on a cookie sheet and bake for 5-7 minutes or until light brown.  Store in an airtight container once cool.At first I wanted to try to make hexagons and figured I could cut the dough into diamonds and then lop off two opposing corners.  But after I cut the dough into diamonds, the dough was too warm to work with so I just stopped there.  I loved how these crackers had some real flavor thanks to the butter and didn't just taste like salty cardboard as oyster crackers too often do.Next up:  Boston cream cupcakes and mousse."},
{"title": "Cassava Heavy Cake", "date": "Friday, February 13, 2009", "text": "I have to admit, that is not the most photogenic slice of cake.  But that cake is kind of a big deal, just like Ron Burgundy.  Two years ago I went with Susan and Kristine to Grand Cayman, where we got to try local Caymanian food at Vivine's Kitchen.  The kitchen is literally her home's kitchen; we parked in her driveway, walked up the front steps to her front door where she met us and guided us out back to her porch.  We tried the conch stew, turtle stew, and whelk, all of which came with plenty of sides including plaintains, rice and beans, potato salad, corn bread and some unidentified tuberous roots.  The best part of the meal, however, was the cassava cake.  As I recall, it was dark, dense, and moist with a glutinous chew to it.  Basically, it was unlike anything we had ever had before, and it was delicious.Fast forward to 2 days ago when Susan sends me this link for a recipe for cassava heavy cake.  At first I was really excited and planned on making this as soon as I could find cassava in Boston.  But then I read through the recipe and realized that even if I found cassava, I probably wouldn't be able to make it.  I mean, you are basically making your own coconut milk from scratch which takes at least 3 hours to boil, not including the time it takes to peel, cut, and blend the coconut meat, and then the cake takes 3 more hours to bake.  I think I'd rather just fly back to Grand Cayman and have some there; it might be quicker.But then I figured I'd look and see if there were any other recipes on-line and found these two which looked a lot simpler.  I still didn't know where I'd find cassava, but then Tammy tells me that it's the same thing as yucca.  I almost smacked my forehead.  Duh!  So I head over to Harvest after work, and what do I see but a whole basket of yucca!  I bought about 3 lbs of it, hoping that I would be able to get at least 2 lbs. of grated cassava after peeling and everything.  I decided to use both dark and light brown sugar because the original recipe called for dark, but the other ones called for either light or didn't specify.  So anyways, here is an amalgam of all 3 recipes.Cassava Heavy Cakemakes 24 slices3 lbs. cassava (yucca root)1 lb. dark brown sugar1/2 lb. light brown sugar2 (14 oz.) cans coconut milk2 tablespoons vanilla extract1 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon nutmeg1/2 teaspoon cinnamon1 stick butter4 heaping teaspoons cornstarchPreheat the oven to 350 °F.Cut off the ends of the cassava and cut crosswise into manageable lengths (about 3\"-5\").  Set a piece down on one of the cut ends and peel by cutting down along the edge and rotating the root.  Once you have peeled all the pieces, wash with cold water and grate.In a large mixing bowl, add grated cassava, coconut milk, vanilla extract, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Stir well.Dissolve the cornstarch in a little water and add to the cassava mixture.Melt one stick of butter in a glass 9\"x13\" baking dish on high for 2 minutes in the microwave.  Tilt the dish to coat the bottom and pour the rest of the melted butter into the cassava mixture and mix well.Bake for one and a half hours or until a firm top is achieved.  Cool completely and serve at room temperature.See, even with some of my toasted coconut ice cream on top this cake isn't very pretty.  But it sure is yummy!  Definitely not as good as I remember Vivine's to be, but then, not many things can stand up to the taste of sweet memories.  If I ever make this again, I would probably grate the cassava more finely or food process it before mixing it with everything else, although some of my taste testers said they like the texture of the grated cassava.  And while you might be tempted to try the cake while it is still warm, it tastes a lot better once it has cooled and set a little more."},

Well, now that I'm not traveling until April, I figured it would be a good time to start.  I picked Boston Organics, which isn't really a CSA, on the recommendation of a lot of my small group members.  Basically, you get to choose the size of box you want, how often you want it delivered, and what you want in the box.  I chose the $29 box, bi-weekly, with 1/2 fruit and 1/2 vegetable.  I got my first delivery today, and here's what I got:If you click on the picture you can go to the flickr page where I've noted what everything is and how much I got of it.  Now comes the fun part:  deciding how to use it all up.  The onions and potatoes are going to go in a clam chowder I'm making for Sunday, and this looks like a really yummy recipe for the collard greens.  Broccoli is a no brainer, but I have a feeling the Swiss chard will be a challenge.  Unfortunately, the avocado is already ripe but I have no idea what to do with it.  The fruit I'm not as concerned about because I've seen a lot of beautiful looking recipes for pear, apple, blood orange, and lemon tarts recently, and if the bananas start getting over-ripe, I love making Erica's mom's banana bread.So does anyone have a good recipe for guacamole or know what else I can do with the avocado and/or Swiss chard?"},
{"title": "Tomato and Eggs over Rice", "date": "Monday, February 9, 2009", "text": "Tomato and eggs over rice is a dish you'll find on many Chinese restaurant menus, but it's so incredibly easy to make that I never order it.  The only preparation is chopping the scallions and tomatoes, and you'll most likely have everything else already in your pantry or refrigerator.This recipe is based on one that I found on the internet a couple of years ago, but I can't seem to find it anymore.  I've made it so many times, though, I make it by memory now, and this is my best recollection.  Most of the tomato and eggs recipes that I see now don't include the addition of rice wine to the beaten eggs (it makes the eggs a little fluffier) or vinegar and sugar to the tomatoes (they bring out the full flavor of the tomatoes), and some don't even include the scallions or sesame oil, which I think are vital flavor components to this dish.Fan Qie Chao Dan (Tomato and Scrambled Eggs)makes 1 serving3 large eggs1 large tomato or 2 plum or Roma tomatoes1 teaspoon rice wine1 teaspoon sesame oil1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, divided plus more to taste2-3 scallions2 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided1/2 teaspoon rice vinegarA pinch of sugar3/4 teaspoon cornstarch1 tablespoon water Beat the eggs and add rice wine, sesame oil, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Let sit at least 15 minutes.Chop the scallions finely and separate the white and green pieces.  Chop the tomatoes into 3/4\" pieces.In a large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon oil until hot.  Add egg mixture and cook, folding the cooked parts up and letting the raw parts run down.  Once the eggs are 90% done (there will still be some shiny liquidy parts on top) transfer to another dish (I usually use the same bowl I beat the eggs in).Clean the pan and heat another tablespoon of oil.  Once it is hot, add the white scallion pieces and the rest of the salt.  Stir fry for 1 minute and then add the tomatoes, the rest of the scallions, vinegar, and sugar.  Cook for another 3 minutes. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water.  Add to the tomato mixture, stirring until the sauce is thickened.  Add the eggs back in and cook for 1 more minute, stirring to mix. Taste and adjust with more salt, sugar, or vinegar to taste.  Serve over rice.Now let's talk a little about how to keep scallions and leftover rice from going bad.  Since I usually cook for just myself, I find that having to buy a whole package of scallions becomes a waste for me because inevitably the last couple of bunches will have withered and dried out by the time I get around to using them.  And when I make rice, it seems silly to make less than a cup, but if I refrigerate the leftovers, they end up just getting dried out and nasty.Then I learned from a previous Japanese roommate that the best way to keep leftover rice is to portion it out into individual servings, wrap it in plastic wrap (yes, just in plastic wrap, no container needed), and freeze it.  Then when you want a serving of rice, you just pop it into the microwave (still in the plastic wrap) and reheat it.  This way, the rice stays nice and hydrated and fluffy!  Plus, it will last a lot longer in the freezer than in the refrigerator.  If you're afraid of freezer burn, you can always put the wrapped packages of rice in a freezer bag.As for the scallions, I tried to replant the roots last year in a seedling tray, and it worked okay except that I had to water them pretty often, and since I traveled so much they finally died on me.  I was going to replant another set but then I had an epiphany:  why don't I just try letting them grow in water like my little bamboo plant?  So I went to the store and picked the freshest looking package of scallions I could find and set them in a long necked vase filled with water up to the white part as soon as I got home.  Within a day I could see the roots regrowing!  And whenever I needed just the green part of the scallion, I would put the white part with the roots back in the vase, and the green part would start growing within a couple of days as well!  You'll eventually have to replace the scallions because they get too thin, but you should be able to get a couple of uses out of the same roots. Next:  Cassava Heavy CakePreviously:  Toasted Coconut Ice Cream with Sesame Brittle and Crystallized Ginger"},
{"title": "Toasted Coconut Ice Cream with Sesame Brittle and Crystallized Ginger", "date": "Monday, February 2, 2009", "text": "I'm a big fan of Häagen-Dazs' Toasted Coconut Sesame Brittle ice cream so when I saw this recipe on Tastespotting, I jumped at the chance to try to make it for myself.  After reading the recipe, however, I realized it was missing a vital ingredient that the original had:  ginger.  Since I wasn't sure how to infuse ginger into the sesame brittle, I chopped some of my homemade crystallized ginger and added it to the ice cream.First, a short lesson on candy making, as you will be making your own sesame brittle.  This recipe calls for the use of a candy thermometer to know when to stop cooking the sugar mixture.  If you have a food thermometer, but aren't sure if it's a candy thermometer, check and see what the highest temperature it will read is.  If it goes up to about 200 °F (and says do not insert in water), it is a meat thermometer.  Do not use this thermometer for this recipe!  If it goes up to about 450 °F, it is a candy thermometer, and you are all set.If you don't happen to have a candy thermometer, you can still make this recipe, but you'll have to be extra-vigilant not to let the sugar syrup get too dark in color.  What will happen during the cooking process is first all the water will boil off.  The temperature will stay at about 230 °F for quite a while until this happens and the color will remain clear.  Once most of the water has evaporated, the bubbles will get thicker and the temperature will gradually climb.  At 320 °F the syrup will just start to turn golden.  A few minutes later, it should turn a deep, golden brown, and at this point the syrup will have reached 340 °F.  This is where you want to turn off the heat and add the butter.  Similar to when adding the cream to molten sugar for the salted butter caramel ice cream, the butter will melt rather violently in the super hot sugar.  But that's just the beginning.  When you add the baking soda to the syrup, it will start bubbling and foaming up, kind of like when you add baking soda and vinegar together to making your paper-mâché volcano \"erupt\".  Except this is a true eruption of some very hot molten sugar, so make sure you are ready to pour it onto the oiled pan once you've added the baking soda.Finally, after pouring the syrup out, you may want to lick the spoon or use your finger to scoop up any leftover syrup from the pot.  Please don't.  Or at least if you really feel the need to play with molten sugar, use a toothpick or something to spin your own sesame brittle lollipop or something.  But just don't be stupid, okay?Sesame Brittle (adapted from here)makes 15 - 20 servingsVegetable oil3/4 cup sesame seeds1/2 cup water2 cups sugar1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar1 cup light corn syrup2 tablespoons unsalted butter1 teaspoon baking sodaIn a large, un-oiled frying pan, toast sesame seeds until golden brown.  Set aside.Generously oil a baking sheet with raised edges with vegetable oil.In a medium-sized heavy saucepan, combine the water, sugar, cream of tartar, and corn syrup and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Using a candy thermometer, boil the mixture until it reaches 340-350 °F, and the color is a deep golden brown.Remove from heat and whisk in the butter, then mix in the toasted sesame seeds and baking soda.  Be careful during these two steps as the butter will react violently with the very hot molten sugar and the baking soda will cause the volume of the sugar to expand rapidly.Pour the mixture onto the oiled pan and spread it out with the back of a wooden spoon.  Let the brittle harden, uncovered, in a cool place for at least 30 minutes.Using a metal spoon, crack the brittle to remove from the pan and store in an airtight container.You'll only need 1 cup of this sesame brittle, which is about 1/5 of the recipe, but you can eat the brittle on its own, and after you take a bite (after it's cooled, people!) I'm sure you'll be glad you made extra.  And now onto the ice cream itself.  I didn't have any coconut rum, so I substituted it with half vanilla rum and half coconut extract.Toasted Coconut Ice Cream with Sesame Brittle and Crystallized Ginger (adapted from here)makes 1 quart1/2 cup shredded unsweetened coconut1 1/2 cups heavy cream2 cups coconut milk1/2 cup sugar1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla rum1 1/2 tablespoons coconut extract1 cup sesame brittle, broken into small shards or pieces and place in the freezer3 tablespoons crystallized ginger, finely choppedToast the coconut in a skillet over medium-high heat, shaking and stirring until a golden brown.  This will probably take less than a minute so be very careful not to burn the coconut.  Store in the freezer.In a medium-sized saucepan, bring the cream, coconut milk, and sugar to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat, add the rum and coconut extract and chill the mixture in the refrigerator overnight.Freeze the mixture in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions.  Once churned, stir in the sesame brittle, toasted coconut, and crystallized ginger and freeze until firm.I was a little suspicious at the small amount of sugar that was used in this recipe.  Only 1/2 cup for a whole quart of ice cream?  But the end product tasted fine.  The addition of the brittle and crystallized ginger add enough sugar, and if the ice cream itself were more sweet, the effect would be entirely too cloying.  As it is, the brittle gives the ice cream a nice crunch while the ginger adds the slightest amount of heat at the end that balances out the creaminess of the coconut ice cream.  Now if only I could find a recipe for Häagen-Dazs' Sticky Toffee Pudding ice cream....Update:  I found one!  Sticky Toffee Pudding Ice Cream"},
{"title": "Clementine Cupcakes", "date": "Thursday, January 29, 2009", "text": "Twas the same snowy morning, and two forlorn clementines were staring at me, beseeching me to do something with them other than throw them away.  They were already several days past their prime, shriveled and sunken, although not yet spoiling.  There must be something I can do with them, I thought.  And then I remembered the clementine cake recipe I had noticed on Smitten Kitchen.  A flourless cake made with whole clementines, almond flour, sugar, and eggs.  Perfect, because I had some leftover almond flour from the macaron experiments that I needed to use up.  Alas, two clementines do not a whole cake make.  So then I thought, why don't I try cupcakes?Since it was snowing, and I didn't have any ice in the freezer, I figured I'd try cooling the clementines outside in a snow bath instead of an ice bath.  I put a metal bowl out, and an hour and 15 minutes later, it was halfway full of snow.I plopped the two clementines in there and covered it with more snow and waited half an hour.  When I looked back on it, this is what I found.One of the clementines melted its own little chimney!If you don't happen to make this on a snowy day, go ahead and just use an ice bath or even a cold water bath.  The clementines don't need to be chilled, just cool enough to cut in half and not worry about getting boiling clementine juice on your fingers.Clementine Cupcakes (adapted from here)makes 8 cupcakes2 clementines2 eggs1/3 cup sugar3/4 cup ground almonds1/3 teaspoon baking powderPowdered sugar for dusting Put the clementines in a pot with cold water to cover, bring to the boil, and cook for 2 hours. Drain and, when cool, cut each clementine in half and remove the seeds.  Then finely chop the skins, pith, and fruit.Preheat the oven to 375 °F. Line a cupcake pan with 8 cupcake liners.Beat the eggs.  Add the sugar, almonds, and baking powder.  Mix well, adding the chopped clementines.Pour the cake mixture into the cupcake liners, about 3/4 full, and bake for 30 minutes, when a skewer will come out clean.  Remove from the oven and cool.Remove the cupcake from the liner, turn upside down, and dust with powdered sugar.  Serve at room temperature.I was a little afraid that the clementines were too old to use, but boiling them in water for two hours really rehydrated them into their young, plump selves.  I filled the liners to about 3/4 full but these cupcakes barely rose so you can probably fill them higher if you want.  The cupcakes break easily when you remove them from the liner, so you can just dust them while they're still in their liners and serve them that way, but I like the look of the individual mini-cakes. I like this recipe because you can definitely taste the clementines, but it's not an overly sweet or tart citrus dessert, like say, a lemon bar or key lime pie.  If you do want something sweeter and more tart, you can always make a simple glaze with lemon juice and powdered sugar and glaze the cupcake with it.  Also, the cupcakes were super moist even without the addition of any oil or butter, which is great if you're worried about that sort of thing.  =)"},
{"title": "Dutch Babies", "date": "Wednesday, January 28, 2009", "text": "On snowy days like this when I get to work from home or on a lazy Saturday morning I like to treat myself and make a Dutch baby.  Ellen first told me about these puffy pancakes and waxed poetically about how good they were.  It wasn't until I was in Ft. Lauderdale with Angela that I got myself to Original Pancake House and finally tried one.  We also ordered their other specialty, the Apple Pancake, but compared to that sugar-laden monstrosity, the Dutch baby was clearly the superior.The Dutch baby contains a lot of egg in its batter and is baked in the oven in a skillet so that it rises to heights never before seen by any other pancake and finally settles down into a custardy shell ready to be topped with powdered sugar, fresh lemon juice, and melted butter.  I actually forgo the additional melted butter don't let that stop you from trying it.When I went looking for the recipe on-line to try to make myself I found two delightful blogs about it:  this one from Orangette, who is one of my favorite food writers, and this one from Steamy Kitchen which showcases her adorable sons making the simple recipe.  Notice that the latter is called a German Oven Pancake; I believe the Dutch moniker arose from a bastardization of the word Deutsch, which is German for German (yay for 3 years of high school German!).  I chose to make the latter simply because I don't usually have half and half in the fridge unless I am making ice cream.  I use a Calphalon Everyday Pan for this; make sure that whatever pan or skillet you use is oven safe.  In other words, if there are any plastic bits, don't put it in the oven!With this recipe we come across the same issue as with the nian gao recipe, namely, how to mix raw eggs, milk, and melted butter together without either cooking the eggs with the melted butter or solidifying the melted butter with cold milk.  My solution is to use very warm milk--not hot enough cook the eggs and at the same time not cold enough to solidify the butter.Dutch Baby (adapted from here)makes one pancake1/3 cup of all-purpose flour, sifted2 eggs, lightly beaten1/3 cup milk1 1/3 tablespoons melted butter2/3 tablespoon sugar1/6 teaspoon of saltLemon juicePowdered sugarBlueberries (optional)Melted butter (optional)Preheat oven to 450 °F.Lightly beat eggs in a large bowl.  In a glass measuring cup, heat the milk in the microwave for 30 seconds so that it is very warm but not too hot.  Add to the eggs.  In the same measuring cup, melt the butter in the microwave for 30 seconds.  Add to the milk and eggs and stir.  Add salt and sugar.Gradually add flour to egg mixture, a spoonful at a time and whisk to incorporate until there are no lumps left.Lightly spray a 9\" oven-safe skillet with cooking spray.  Pour batter in the skillet.  Bake 12-18 minutes, just until the edges are golden.  Check your pancake at the 12 minute mark.Remove from oven and set on a trivet.  Serve hot and top with lemon juice, powdered sugar, blueberries, and melted butter, if desired.I've also seen posts where people have topped theirs with apples and cinnamon or caramelized pears, but I prefer the simple tartness of lemons and blueberries.  Eating a Dutch baby requires some care, not only because the pan will be quite hot, but also because if you breathe in while bringing a piece into your mouth, you're likely to inhale quite a lot of powdered sugar."},
{"title": "Xiao Long Bao (Steamed Soup Dumplings)", "date": "Tuesday, January 27, 2009", "text": "New word of the day: as⋅pic [as-pik]– noun, a savory jelly usually made with meat or fish stock and gelatin.Of course, when you say it, it sounds like the action of relieving an itch in your butt crack.  Anyways, aspic is the secret ingredient for making xiao long bao, or steamed soup dumplings.  Because aspic is solid, you can easily wrap it in a dumpling along with the meat filling, and when you steam it, the aspic melts and becomes the hot, gushing soup that squirts out of the bun and burns your tongue.You can make your own aspic by either making fresh stock and boiling it down and chilling it so that it solidifies or dissolving unflavored gelatin (like Knox) in chicken broth and chilling it.  I found out that if I chilled the leftover braising liquid from making my mom's beer duck (sorry, it's a classified recipe now, but you can probably find it on-line somewhere else) it solidifies into an aspic.  And since I had made some beer duck the night before and Liv and Ruth were making fresh dumpling skins, I figured we should try to make some xiao long bao as well!First, to make the homemade dumpling skins, all you need is flour and hot water.  Ruth doesn't really use measurements and mostly goes by feel, but I found this recipe on the chowhound forums that works pretty well.Homemade Dumpling Skins (adapted from here)makes 56 skins3 cups all-purpose flour1 cup boiling water4 tablespoons cold waterFlour for dustingPour boiling water into the flour, quickly stir with a fork or chopstick, mix well, then add the cold water.  Mix and knead into a soft dough about 5 minutes.Cover with damp cloth or paper towel.  Set aside and rest for 20 minutes.Knead the dough for 1 minute and divide into 4 quarters.  Roll one quarter into a long snake and pinch into about 1 inch lengths.Dust flour on work surface.  Roll each piece into a circle of about a 3 inch diameter.You'll want to make the edges a little thinner than the center, and for xiao long bao, you definitely want the edges very thin since you'll be doing a lot of pleating.  The great thing about making your own skin for wrapping dumplings is that it's much stretchier than the kind you buy so you don't need to worry as much about overfilling.  Also, you don't need to add that ring of water around the edge to make the dough stick.  In fact, if you get the dough wet (from the filling or whatnot), it doesn't stick as well.  If that happens, just set it aside and work on the next one.  When it dries out a bit you can try pinching it again to make it stick.Now back to making xiao long bao.  Actually, this is a very un-traditional version since I was just using my mom's pork and cabbage dumpling filling and beer duck aspic.  A more traditional xiao long bao filling wouldn't have the napa cabbage or bean thread vermicelli in it and maybe would have shrimp or crab meat in it instead.  But I wasn't about to make a separate filling or aspic for this experiment so tough cookies.Joy's Untraditional Xiao Long Baomakes however many you wantLeftover braising sauce from Mama Huang's Beer Duck, chilled overnight to form an aspicPork and cabbage dumpling fillingHomemade dumpling skins (recipe above)2 large napa cabbage leaves per steamer tray, washedGinger, peeled and juliennedBlack vinegarTake a dumpling skin, spoon some dumpling filling into it and spread it out to form a thin layer.Add a 1/2 teaspoon of aspic.  Add a little more dumpling filling on top.Gather one edge of the dumpling skin and start pleating all the way around, twisting at the end to seal. (Here's a video of Ruth showing us how to do this, with Liv reminding us how to pronounce the gelatinous soup.)Place two napa cabbage leaves on the bottom of each steamer tray, cutting off the white stem if necessary to fit.Place the wrapped dumplings on the leaves and steam for 10 minutes.Serve with a dipping sauce of julienned ginger and black vinegar.I didn't really notice the addition of the cabbage and vermicelli in the filling that much because the duck aspic melts into this wonderful broth that almost overwhelms everything else.  In fact, I wish the pork filling I used wasn't seasoned because the duck aspic was more than enough seasoning by itself.  Just remember to be careful biting into the soup dumplings because the soup may be really, really hot!"},
{"title": "Luo Buo Gao (Chinese Turnip Cake)", "date": "Sunday, January 25, 2009", "text": "So for Chinese New Year's Eve I invited people over for a dumpling making party.  I didn't even realize that making dumplings was a Chinese New Year's tradition, although I had thrown some in the past because I just figured it was an excuse to do something \"Chinese\" on the holiday.  But apparently the shape of the dumplings resembles the gold that they used for money back in the day so it's an auspicious food to eat on New Year's Day.I also decided to try my hand at making luo buo gao, or Chinese turnip cake.  I usually see this at dim sum all fried up and served with soy sauce paste (or is it oyster sauce or hoisin sauce?), but according to the internets it is also something traditional to eat for Chinese New Year. Luo Buo Gao (Chinese Turnip Cake) (based on this recipe)makes about 24 slices2 1/2 to 3 cups daikon, peeled and julienned or shredded (about 1 1/2 to 2 lbs.)1 Chinese sausage, finely diced2 cups rice flour (do not use glutinous rice flour)1 3/4 cups water, divided1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon white pepperVegetable oilStir fry Chinese sausage in a large frying pan or work for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add daikon, 3/4 cups water, salt, and white pepper.  Bring to a boil, then remove from heat.  Grease a square cake pan or loaf pan and start the steamer.Mix rice flour with 1 cup water.  Add the daikon and sausage mixture and spread into the greased pan.  Steam for 50 minutes.Cool overnight in refrigerator.  After cooling, cut the cake into 1/4\" slices and pan fry in a liberal amount of oil until both sides are golden brown.Serve with soy sauce paste (or oyster sauce or hoisin sauce).You can also add shitake mushrooms and/or small dried shrimp, but I didn't have either and, as Annie said, you can't really go wrong with Chinese sausage. The hardest part about making this was finding a dish to steam the cake in.  Since I was using my stock pot and pasta insert to steam, I needed something that would fit, and none of my square (or even circular) cake pans were small enough.  So I improvised with a large serving bowl, and it did the trick.Another hard part?  Reading the recipe correctly.  For some reason, I thought it said 1 1/2 to 2 cups instead of lbs. so I only had about half as much daikon as I needed in there.  The result was a drier cake than you get in the restaurants, but still edible, although boys will eat anything....  So learn from my mistakes and read the recipe correctly, okay?Previously:  Scallion PancakesNext up:  Xiao Long Bao (Steamed Soup Buns)"},

I've tried making scallion pancakes from scratch before but could never get them quite as light and flakey as I like; they were always just a little too chewy.  You don't get that problem with this recipe because the secret is in letting the dough rest so that the gluten relaxes enough to allow you to stretch the dough out really, really thin.  The recipe is super simple, but just make sure you give yourself sufficient time; the results are worth it.Scallion Pancakes (Cong You Bing)makes 6 pancakes1 lb. all-purpose flour1 cup warm waterChopped scallionsVegetable oilSaltMix the flour and water together and knead for 5 minutes.  Cover and let sit for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Knead for another 5 minutes and let rest for another 30 minutes at room temperature.  Knead one more time for 5 minutes.Divide into 6 (4 oz.) portions.  Roll into balls and cover liberally with oil.  Cover and let sit in the refrigerator for 1 hour.Let the dough come back to room temperature.  On an oiled stainless steel surface (I used my non-stick baking tray), roll out one ball of dough and stretch out as thin as possible into a rectangle, being careful not to make any holes in the dough.  You should be able to cover almost the entire surface of the baking tray, if you're using one.Brush the top with oil and sprinkle with salt and scallions.Starting at one long end, start \"flipping\" inches of the dough towards the other long end so that you are kind of rolling it up into a long snake.  Once it is all folded up, twist the dough like a rope and then coil it up into a spiral.  Flatten the spiral with your hands to form pancake discs.  Repeat with the other balls of dough.Heat a liberal amount of oil in a frying pan.  When it is hot (but not smoking), add one pancake.  After a few minutes, flip once it is golden brown on the bottom.  Wait another few minutes until the second side is golden brown as well.  Repeat with the other pancakes.Slice the pankcake into wedges and serve hot with a dipping sauce of soy sauce mixed with vinegar, sugar, and sesame oil.To store the pancakes, freeze them in a freezer bag and re-heat on the pan with additional oil.  You can also try toasting them in the oven, but it will get dry.Flaky!"},
{"title": "Sugar and Soy Sauce: A Collection of Recipes from My Mom (and Other Recipes I Like)", "date": "Wednesday, January 21, 2009", "text": "It's my mom's birthday today, and I made her cry.As you already know, I think my mom is the best home cook in the world, and I've been bugging her to teach me more of her recipes for the past couple of months.  She gladly taught me, but I could sense she was a little confused and even slightly annoyed at how persistent I was about making sure I got every little measurement right since she almost never measured out her ingredients.  What she didn't know was that I was getting all her recipes so that I could make her a cookbook for her birthday.Well, she got the book in the mail, and when she called me she was crying.  A lot.  At first I was alarmed thinking something was wrong with her or my dad, but eventually she was able to stop crying long enough to tell me that she had gotten the book and to thank me for it.  The funniest part is, I had called her about a week ago to let her know to expect something in the mail since the book was being delivered without a card or a message.  Since my mom hates surprises, she demanded to know what it was, and I finally relented by telling her that she could guess.  She figured out that it was a book, and then that it was a cookbook, to which she responded with indignation because, \"what could [she] possibly learn from a cookbook?\"I titled the book \"Sugar and Soy Sauce\" because early on I had learned that just about every dish she makes includes at least some sugar and to a slightly lesser degree, soy sauce.  The book includes 16 recipes, over half of which are my mom's.  The other ones are some of my other favorite Chinese recipes that I've picked up over the years from friends like Karen's scallion pancakes, Jaleen's peanut butter noodles, and Joanna's nian gao.Ever since I've been posting up my mom's recipes, she's been chiding me for giving away her secrets.  Well, now that the book is published, I've decided to (partially) obey her and stop giving them away, at least for free.  If you'd like a copy of the book, you can buy it yourself here at lulu.com.  It's $30, and I make a whopping $1.24 per book so I'm obviously not in it for the money, more just for the fame.  Haha, jk.  It's a hardback book with lots and lots of full color pictures.  There's a preview of the book if you follow the link, but here's a taste (pun intended) of what's inside:And if you ask me really nicely, I might even sign the book for you.  =)"},
{"title": "Char Siu Bao", "date": "Sunday, January 18, 2009", "text": "Liv and Ruth came over yesterday to make some bao zi, or more accurately, Ruth and I made bao zi and Liv washed the veggies, diced the meat, fixed my chairs, set up my HDTV, and cleaned up afterwards.  I'm not complaining!  =)  At first we were going to just make veggie buns (su cai bao) and pork and cabbage buns, but I thought it might be fun to try to make char siu bao.  I really like the big, fluffy, white char siu bao you can get a Cantonese dim sum, but after trying to find the recipe on-line, it looks like the only way to get that is with a Vietnamese mix, and I didn't really feel like heading back out to try to find some.  And I was all ready to make char siu pork from scratch using a marinade of soy sauce, hoisin sauce, five spice powder, and honey, but then I found a jar of char siu sauce at the Asian grocery store, all mixed up and ready to go.  So I copped out and bought that since, after all, this is my first time trying to make char siu, and I was making the dough from scratch.Char Siu Porkmakes enough for 16 buns and one or two servings over rice1.6 lbs. pork butt or shoulder (you want something fatty, pork loin wouldn't work)1 (8.5 oz.) jar of char siu sauceCut the pork into long strips about 1 cm thick.  Using a fork, prick the strips all over to tenderize and also to help the sauce marinate the meat thoroughly.  Add 5 tablespoons of the char siu sauce and marinate overnight in the refrigerator.Pre-heat the oven to 350 °F.  Boil 2 cups of water.Place the pork strips on a grilling rack in a single layer.  (I used the racks from my toaster oven with a baking pan underneath.)  Add enough boiling water to the bottom of the pan to come to a depth of 1/2 inch.  Roast for 10 minutes.Turn the strips with tongs and baste with more char siu sauce.  Repeat every 10-15 minutes until the pork has roasted for at least a total of 30 minutes.Remove from the oven and allow to cool.  Slice the pork on the diagonal against the grain.  You can serve the pork with rice and vegetables, on top of ramen, or use as a filling for char siu bao.I liked how the sauce made the pork (artificially) red just like the kind you get from Cantonese restaurants, and the taste seemed similar enough, although the texture wasn't as crispy as what you get at a restaurant.  Maybe next time I will try making this without the water bath or on a barbecue grill.To prepare the char siu pork as filling for char siu bao, you'll need to dice the pork into small pieces and add a little more char siu sauce to bind it together.Char Siu Baomakes 16 buns1 recipe for hua juan dough, mixed, kneaded, risen once, and re-kneaded1 lb. char siu pork, either homemade or from a store, diced2 tablespoons char siu sauceToss the diced pork with the char siu sauce, adding a teaspoon or two of warm water if necessary.Divide the dough into 16 equal parts.  Take one piece, roll it into a ball, and flatten with your hands.  Stretch the circle out so that it is about the size of your palm.  (You could use a rolling pin to do this, but there's no need.)Add about 1 tablespoon of filling to the middle of the dough.  Cup your hand so that the dough comes up around the filling.  Using the hand not holding the dough, pinch a bit of the edge, pull it up and away from you.  Then grab another piece further away from you and continue around the dough, rotating as you go.  Once you have gone all the way around, twist what you have left between your fingers and seal.Here is a (mostly silent) video of Ruth showing how to do it with her su cai bao:    Place the bun sealed side down on a square of parchment paper.  Return the filled buns to the oven (set at the lowest possibly setting) for 20-30 minutes to proof.Add water to your steamer (I use my stock pot with the pasta insert and steamer insert for two levels) and heat on high.  Once the water is boiling, place the buns in your steamer and steam for 13-15 minutes.I found that when I made this I had added too much char siu sauce to the diced pork so it was too salty, so I reduced the amount in the recipe above, and I would suggest adding a little water to dilute the sauce even further so that you have enough sauce to bind the meat all together.If you're not going to eat all the buns right away, you can freeze them in a freezer bag and reheat them individually in the microwave for 1 minute, wrapped with plastic wrap or in a sandwich bag."},
{"title": "Mayonnaise Shrimp with Candied Walnuts", "date": "Thursday, January 15, 2009", "text": "Back when I lived in Taiwan at the insistence of some of my friends I went prawn fishing once.  It was a curious sport and consisted of sitting on an upended plastic bucket next to an artificial pool stocked with hundreds of prawns.  You were equipped with a fishing rod, raw chicken meat, and a razor blade.  Basically, you cut the chicken with the razor, hook it on the fish hook, dip it into the pool, and just wait.  Much like crabbing, there's no tug, you just wait and pull up at irregular intervals and see if you caught anything.I remember catching a good amount because every time I caught one, I'd start screaming.  These prawn did not resemble the nice headless, frozen shrimp we can buy in grocery stores.  No, these prawns were the size of my hand with long antennae and legs that still moved!  It was more akin to an insect than a shrimp, and they scared the heck out of me.  Fortunately, my friends had no such issues and were able to net them for me.Apparently, part of the fee that you pay to fish for the prawn included grilling them and serving them for you when you were done.  Then I ran into an even larger problem--I had never removed the head from a prawn before; whenever I had that particular issue I just had my mom do it for me.  But my mom was half a world away, and the longer I hesitated, the less prawns were left as everybody else was grabbing them as fast as they could eat them.  So I finally sucked it up and did it.  I'm still really grossed out at pictures of prawn though.Anyways, this recipe has nothing to do with those prawns other than the fact that it is a shrimp recipe, but I just thought I'd share.  I believe it is Cantonese in origin, and the first time I learned how to make it was from a friend in college that had learned it from his mom.The combination of juicy prawns lightly fried and tossed in a sweet and tangy mayonnaise based sauce is hard to resist.  Add to that candied walnuts and a ring of bright green broccoli, and you've got yourself a dish that will definitely impress.  The trickiest part is timing--you want to fry the shrimp at the last second so that it is still hot when you serve it.  Otherwise, you can prepare everything else ahead of time.I loosely followed the Honey Walnut Prawns recipe from About.com, but the next time I make this I will definitely try another method for making the candied walnuts.  Their directions were pretty complicated, and I know I've made candied walnuts before via another method that involved toasting them rather than frying them.  There are tons of recipes out there for making candied walnuts so I'll let you choose whichever one seems best for you.Mayonnaise Shrimp (loosely based on the Honey Walnut Prawns recipe from About.com)serves 61/2 cup walnuts1 cup sugar1 cup oil1 cup broccoli crowns, cut into 1\" pieces1 tablespoon oilsalt to taste3 tablespoons mayonnaise3 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice1 lb of large or medium shrimp, peeled and deveined1 cup cornstarch1/2 cup oilRinse walnuts, then boil in 5 cups water for 15 minutes.  Start boiling another 2 cups of water separately.  Drain and add 2 cups boiling water and sugar.  Continue boiling and stirring occasionally until sugar dissolves.In a small saucepan, heat oil until almost smoking, about 400 °F.  With two slotted spoons, use the first to drain a small batch of walnuts.  Carefully add to the oil and stir with the second slotted spoon.  Deep fry walnuts until shiny and brown, no longer golden; this will only take a minute or two.  Use the second slotted spoon to remove the walnuts from the oil and place in a heat-proof bowl lined with paper towels to drain.  Continue frying walnuts in small batches.  Store walnuts in an air-tight container until ready to use.In a large saute pan heat 1 tablespoon of oil until hot.  Add broccoli and salt and stir fry for 2-3 minutes, until the broccoli turns bright green.  Add 1/2 cup water to the pan and cover, allowing the broccoli to steam for about 3-5 minutes until done.  Remove from pan and line the edge of a large plate with the broccoli pieces.  Alternatively, you can steam the broccoli instead of pan-frying/steaming them.Mix mayonnaise, sweetened condensed milk, and lemon juice in a medium bowl until smooth.Place the corn starch in a shallow bowl and coat the shrimp well.Heat 1/2 cup of oil until very hot, then deep fry the shrimp until golden brown, working in small batches.  This is a very quick process; the shrimp only needs to be cooked for about 30 seconds each.  Drain, then fold in mayonnaise mixture.Mix well, sprinkle with walnuts, and transfer to the middle of the dish ringed with broccoli.  Serve hot with rice."},
{"title": "Mochi Ice Cream", "date": "Wednesday, January 14, 2009", "text": "Since I had already made the red bean ice cream, I thought I'd try to make mochi ice cream with it.  There a bunch of directions on-line, and it seemed simple enough.  Heck, you didn't even need to turn on the stove; you cook the mochi in the microwave!  But what the recipes don't tell you is that mochi is the stickiest thing on earth!  It'll stick to your fingers, your hands, the bowl, the utensils you use, the utensils you use to try to unstick it from the utensils you use...  I got so frustrated after trying to make 3 of them (2 of which ended up in my mouth rather than back in the freezer because they were so ugly), I gave up.  But here's the recipe if you want to try.  =)Mochi Ice Cream (adapted from here)makes 10Ice cream flavor of your choice100 grams glutinous rice flour180 ml water50 grams sugarCornstarchLet the ice cream sit in room temperature for a few minutes or until it becomes soften.  Scoop and roll the ice cream into 10 round balls.  Put the ice cream balls back in the freezer to re-harden.Mix the water, sugar and flour together well in a microwavable mixing bowl.  Cover and microwave for 2 minutes.  Stir batter, re-cover, and microwave for another 30 seconds.  Stir once more and allow to cool.Cover the bottom of a 9 x 13 inch glass baking dish with cornstarch.  Once the mochi is cool, spread it out in the dish.  Cut and divide into 10 pieces.Pick up one piece of dough.  Flatten it with your palm and wrap it around a ball of ice cream.  Repeat this process for the other pieces of mochi and ice cream.Place it in the freezer to re-harden the ice cream.  About 10 minutes before serving, let sit at room temperature to soften slightly.Honestly, it looks like a frozen thumb on a mini-bun....I think next time (if there is a next time) I try to make mochi ice cream, I might try this recipe, which includes corn syrup in the mochi (to keep it soft and pliable when frozen) and freezing the mochi before wrapping the ice cream.  I think this might make the mochi less sticky to work with and obviously prevent the ice cream from melting too much while you're working with it."},
{"title": "Red Bean Ice Cream", "date": "Monday, January 12, 2009", "text": "So I had some leftover sweetened condensed milk from making mayonnaise shrimp and some leftover sweetened red beans from making the nian gao and put them in the same container thinking I could make some shaved ice later.  But then I realized that it's way too cold for shaved ice and decided to try to make red bean ice cream instead (don't ask me why ice cream is acceptable but shaved ice isn't; it just is, okay?)  I also had some leftover heavy cream from making the peppermint ice cream so I added what I had left along with an equal amount of skim milk.   Alternatively, you can use 1 1/2 cups half and half since half and half is half cream and half milk.  And I just wrote \"half\" 6 times in that sentence.  =)Red Bean Ice Creammakes 1 quart1 (14 oz.) can sweetened condensed milk3/4 cup sweetened red beans3/4 cup heavy cream3/4 cup milkMix the ingredients and chill in the refrigerator for a few hours until cold.Churn in a ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.Freeze for several hours or overnight until hardened.Usually you don't add the non-liquid parts of an ice cream batter to the ice cream maker until the end, but I wanted to mash up the red beans a bit and get the red color incorporated into the ice cream so threw them in there from the really beginning.  I love how you can taste the flavor of the sweetened condensed milk, and it reminds me of shaved ice without being all icy.You know, I think this is the first recipe I've come up with all by myself without adapting anyone else's!Next:  My attempt at making red bean mochi ice cream...."},
{"title": "Nian Gao (aka Mochi Cake)", "date": "Sunday, January 11, 2009", "text": "Another Chinese dessert that is traditionally eating in the winter, or more specifically, for the New Year, is nian gao.  Similar to the Korean dduk and Japanese mochi, it is made from glutinous rice flour, which can be found in Asian grocery stores.  Make sure you get the glutinous version (I buy the green bag with the 3 elephants on it) versus regular rice flour (the red bag with the 3 elephants on it).  This recipe (from Joanna Lee) has sweetened red beans baked into it and is very rich because of all the butter.  You could use a little less butter, but really, why would you want to? Nian Gao (Mochi Cake with Red Beans)makes 24 pieces 1 stick unsalted butter, melted (and cooled to room temperature)1 1/4 cups white sugar3 eggs1 teaspoon vanilla extract3 cups milk, warmed to a little hotter than a fever1 pound (16 ounces) glutinous rice flour (the green bag with the 3 elephants on it)1 teaspoon baking powder1 (18.75 ounce) can red bean paste or sweetened red beans Preheat oven to 350 °F.  Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.In a large bowl, mix together the butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla and milk.  Stir in the rice flour and baking powder.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan.   Drop red bean paste by scant teaspoonfuls onto the top of the cake.  If spoonfuls are too big, the filling will sink to the bottom.Bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cake springs back when lightly touched.  It should be golden.Serve small slices of this very rich cake at room temperature or slightly warmed.The hardest part about making this dish is getting all the ingredients to mix.  You don't want the butter to be too hot or else it will cook the eggs, but if the milk is straight out of the fridge it will solidify the butter.  If you do run into that problem, you could try microwaving the mixture just enough so that the butter melts again, but I think it is easier to get the milk warm before adding it to the butter.For extra decadence, you can slice the nian gao into thin slices, dip them in beaten egg, and pan-fry for Cantonese-style nian gao."},
{"title": "Thin Crust Chicken Masala Pizza with Spinach and Parmesan Cheese", "date": "Wednesday, January 7, 2009", "text": "I'm supposed to be in Green Bay right now, only I'm not; I'm sitting in my own kitchen typing this.  In my two years of working in a position where I travel 50%, this is the first time that my flights have been completely cancelled.  Not just delayed, but cancelled.  I consider myself lucky on two accounts:  1) that this is the first time, and 2) that I found out when I was still sitting in this chair at home 2 hours before the flight.  I'm just grateful I didn't have to find out at the airport or worse, wasn't stuck waiting at the airport as they delayed the flight repeatedly before they cancelled.So since I was stuck at home I decided to try making some chicken masala since I'd been thinking about learning how to make Indian food.  I started off small, though, and bought the Trader Joe's masala simmer sauce instead of making my own and just added cut-chicken breast and some frozen spinach.  Heaped on top of brown jasmine rice, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't...satisfying.  My two roommates had already helped themselves to some, so I just had a little bit left, maybe a third of a cup.  It wasn't exactly enough to toss, but not enough for another meal either.And then I thought, why not try to make a pizza out of it?  I seriously don't even know where the idea came from, but it didn't seem absolutely far-fetched.  The masala was tomato-based, and I'd seen plenty of pizzas with chicken and spinach on them.  The only cheese I had in the fridge was some shredded parmesan, but why not give it a shot?  I dug out The Kitchn's old thin crust pizza recipe, which thankfully did not need a lot of time to make.Less than an hour later, I was taking the first bite of this strange, new pizza.  The crust was exactly as it had been described:  slightly crunchy but with a bit of a chew to it, and innocuous enough for whatever you wanted to pile on top.  The pizza as a whole kind of reminded me of California Pizza Kitchen's BBQ Chicken pizza except that instead of bbq sauce, it was masala sauce, so spicier and less sweet.  I only added a very light sprinkle of the parmesan so that you can barely taste it, but something about the texture kind of tempers the spiciness of the masala sauce.Thin Crust Chicken Masala Pizza with Spinach and Parmesan Cheesemakes one 8\"x11\" pizza1/2 jar Trader Joe's masala simmer sauce9 oz. chicken breast meat, cut into 1\" chunks3/4 cup frozen spinach1 thin crust pizza dough (I used half the recipe from here)1/4 cup shredded parmesan or mozzarella cheeseAdd 1/2 cup water and chicken to the simmer sauce.  Heat to boiling and then reduce to simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occassionally.  After 10 minutes, add the spinach and stir to mix.Have 3 small girls eat their 3 small servings over rice and save the remaining 1/3 cup.  Shred remaining chicken.Heat oven to 500 °F and place a baking stone in the lower middle rack.Place the pizza dough on a 12\" sheet of parchment paper and use your hands to spread the dough out to 1/4\" thickness or less.  Top with the chicken masala mixture and spread out with a spoon.  Add more masala simmer sauce if necessary to cover.Transfer the pizza to the baking stone using a baking sheet or thin cutting board.  Bake for 5 minutes and then turn 180° and bake another 3 minutes.Sprinkle cheese on top and bake for another 2-3 minutes.Remove from oven and let sit on a wire rack to cool for at least 5 minutes (this is when the crust gets crispy so it's worth the wait!).I still have one ball of pizza dough left so I think when I come back from Green Bay and Chicago I'll try making a breakfast pizza with eggs on top.  Or maybe the bbq chicken pizza.  We'll see...."},
{"title": "Buckeyes", "date": "Tuesday, January 6, 2009", "text": "So in anticipation dread of the OSU victory defeat over the Longhorns in last night's Fiesta Bowl, I decided to try my hand at making buckeyes, or chocolate covered peanut butter balls.  These are so ubiquitous in Ohio that they sold them in my high school cafeteria.  (Among other things I actually miss from my high school cafeteria were their yeast rolls and the \"Mexican pizza\" which was delicious, although I'm not sure what made it so \"Mexican\".)  They were also fun to throw up and make stick to the ceiling, only to drop sometime later on some unsuspecting fool.  But please don't do that with these, although that might be an unnecessary warning as you'll probably have more issues with not stuffing your mouth with these.The buckeye candies are so-called because of their resemblence to the nut of the buckeye tree, which is the state tree of Ohio (yes, Terry, I looked it up!).  I used the recipe from The Kitchn except that instead of edible parrafin wax, I substituted some shortening to make the chocolate a bit more workable for dipping purposes.Chocolate and Peanut Butter Buckeyes (adapted from The Kitchn)makes about 2 dozen10.5 oz. powdered sugar1 cup smooth peanut butter2/3 cup unsalted butter1/2 lb. chocolate chips, semi-sweet (24 oz.)1 tablespoon shortening (you can use butter if you have no shortening)Add the peanut butter and butter to a medium mixing bowl and warm in the microwave for 30 seconds.  You want both to soften up but not melt.  Add the sugar and stir a few times so that the sugar gets incorporated and won't make a big mess when you take the electric mix to it.Whip the mixture with an electric mixer and chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour (I set it out in the snow in my backyard). After it's chilled, roll into small, 1-inch balls.  Put these back into the fridge or freezer (or snow-covered backyard) on a aluminum foil covered baking sheet.Melt the chocolate and shortening in a double boiler, over, not in, boiling water, stirring mixture until smooth.  Keep warm.Once the balls are almost rock hard, dip balls in the chocolate using a toothpick, leaving an uncovered spot on top.  Chill covered in refrigerator or freezer.  When completely hard, store in the refrigerator or freezer.I think the hardest part about making this was making sure that the peanut butter mixture and balls were sufficiently cold before moving on to the next steps.  You can see in the picture of the naked buckeyes (can't wait to see what google search words are used to get to this page) that some are smoother than others.  After the rolling the first few balls, my hands started getting really sticky with warm peanut butter, so I put the mixture back out to chill again.  Then when it came time to dip them, the first few I tried weren't cold enough yet so they almost fell off the toothpicks.  After I re-chilled the rest of the balls, it was a lot easier.  Make sure that you don't let the balls stay in the warm chocolate too long or else the peanut butter will start melting into the chocolate. Maybe, hopefully, I'll have an opportunity to makes these once again when March rolls around....  =)One year ago:  Gaufres de Leige (Belgian Waffles)"},
{"title": "Hua Juan (Steamed Scallion Buns)", "date": "Monday, January 5, 2009", "text": "By popular request, here is my mom's hua juan recipe.  Hua juan are steamed buns flavored with scallions and twisted to look kind of like a flower (hua juan means \"flower twist\" in Mandarin).It is a yeast dough recipe, so you'll have to plan ahead to allow time for the dough to rise and then for the shaped buns to proof.  Also, you'll need a way to steam the buns; I use my stock pot with the pasta insert and steamer insert for two layers of steamy goodness.Hua Juan (Steamed Scallion Buns)makes 12 bunsFor the dough:1/2 packet yeast (a little more than 1 teaspoon)3 cups flour1 cup milk, warmed to a little hotter than a fever (can you tell this recipe is from my mom?)6 tablespoons sugar1/4 cups vegetable oilFor the glaze:3 tablespoons chopped scallions, green part only1/2 teaspoon salt1/4 teaspoon sugar1 tablespoon sesame oilTurn on oven to lowest setting.  Dissolve the yeast in the warm milk.  Mix in the rest of the ingredients for the dough and knead.  Cover with a moist cloth or seal tightly and place in oven for 1 hour.Mix together the ingredients for the glaze and allow to macerate.Knead the dough again after it has doubled in size and then separate into 12 egg-sized pieces.Roll each piece into a long oval and cut into long strips, leaving a 1/4\" section attached at one end.  Brush lightly with the glaze.Twist and shape buns and place on square of parchment paper.Cover the buns and let sit in oven again for another 40 - 60 minutes to proof.Steam for 13 minutes.If not not eating immediately, transfer to a freezer bag once it has cooled and freeze.  To reheat, wrap with plastic wrap or put in a fold-and-close sandwich bag and microwave for 45 seconds.The great thing about this recipe is that you can use the dough itself to make man tou (steamed bread buns) or stuff it with red bean paste to make dou sha bao.  Once I even stuffed it with leftover dumpling filling and made rou bao zi."},

Continue adding more water until the dough is the consistency of Play-Doh.  It should feel slightly wet and cooling to the touch, but neither runny nor crumbly.Set aside 1/3 of the dough and cover so it doesn't dry out.  With the other 2/3 of dough, take a handful at a time and roll into a long snake, covering the remaining dough.  Pinch off centimeter long pieces and place on a plate, being careful not to let them touch each other.  Roll each piece with both hands into a ball and set back on the plate.

If they are stuck to the plate, heat the bottom of the plate over low heat until they can be removed easily but make sure they don't get warm enough to melt.To cook, boil water in a medium pot.  Start boiling another pot or tea kettle of water.  Add the rice balls to the first pot and cook until they have been floating for a minute or two.  Transfer with a slotted spoon to serving bowls.  Add the boiling water from the second pot or tea kettle and add sugar to taste.Alternatively, add to hua sen tang (sweet peanut soup).  I'd tell you how to make that except my mom hasn't taught me yet, and it involves a pressure cooker, which I don't have.  So you'll just have to settle for a picture of it.  =)You can also try filling the balls with sweet sesame paste, red bean paste, or peanut butter.  And for extra bonus points, you could fill it with lotus paste, roll it in sesame seeds, and deep fry them to make those awesome sesame balls you can get at Cantonese dim sum.Happy new year, everyone!"},
{"title": "Hot Pot", "date": "Monday, December 29, 2008", "text": "One of the few holiday traditions my family has is to do huo guo, or hot pot, when my brother and I are home.  It's very similar to the Japanese shabu shabu, but I think the biggest difference is in the dipping sauce.I've noticed that most Taiwanese people use a lot more sa cha, or Chinese barbecue sauce, and also add a raw egg to thicken the sauce up even more.  Now sa cha is this intensely flavorful sauce that tastes different from anything else I've ever tasted.  And apparently, it usually contains brill fish and fermented shrimp paste, which is why there is a vegetarian version of it.  If you've never tried this sauce before, the old adage, \"a little goes a long way\" definitely applies.  But for those of us that are addicted to it for hot pot, you can almost never get enough.  Every time I go out for shabu shabu now I have to ask for a small bowl of sa cha because they never give you more than like a tablespoon to start off with.Now let's talk about the raw egg.  My family splits the egg so that the egg yolk goes in your bowl to be mixed into the dipping sauce and the egg white goes in the boiling water to be cooked.  I didn't realize this was unusual until I started hosting hot pot parties and everyone else either used the whole raw egg in their dipping sauce or didn't use it at all.  For those who are concerned about salmonella and stuff, you can always add enough of the boiling water to your bowl to temper the sauce so that the heat kills off all the bad germs, but I prefer to keep the sauce as undiluted as possible.  I figure I've lived a year in Taiwan eating street food and survived so I should be able to handle a raw egg every once in a while.Lastly, I add soy sauce to the dipping sauce in about a 1:1 ratio with the sa cha.  You can also add chopped raw garlic, chopped scallions, chopped ginger, hot sauce, heck, someone I know even puts peanut butter in there.  Speaking of weird hot pot combinations, I once had a Coca-cola hot pot in Taiwan where Coke was used instead of broth and the dipping sauce kind of resembled a ranch dressing but thinner.  It was weird, but surprisingly yummy.As for what to put in the hot pot, these are my personal favorites:  napa cabbage, Shanghai bok choi, taro, firm tofu, tofu puffs, fried gluten, sliced pork, fish balls, shrimp balls, fish cakes, enoki mushrooms, and bean thread vermicelli.  You can also use any type of sliced meat, fish, shrimp, shellfish, veggies, noodles...anything!  Even though I usually don't like pork, it's my favorite meat to use in hot pot because it's so fatty that it remains tender after boiling.  Chicken usually gets too tough and dry and a poorer cut of beef will also be too tough and dry but a better cut of beef would be wasted by boiling.  If you can't find any sliced meat (I find this at Asian grocery stores) you can always slice it yourself.  I find that it's a lot easier to get a very thin slice with a partially frozen block of meat.  And if you have the time and are so inclined, you can roll up each individual slice so that when you dump it into the hot pot you don't get a huge wad of meat stuck together.  Plus, it looks pretty.  =)I have an electric hot pot with interchangeable plates so that I can use it to grill as well.  You can also use an electric hot plate or a portable gas burner with your own pot.  Basically you want to be able to have a boiling pot of broth in the middle of a table so that people can sit around and grab what they want to eat out of the hot pot.  A fondue pot most likely wouldn't work because it wouldn't be able to keep a pot of broth boiling.Since I my pot has a non-stick coating, I only use allow plastic utensils (ladles, slotted spoons, etc.) to be used in it, but traditionally everyone gets their own little metal net to use.  Sometimes people use two bowls, one larger one to put the cooked food in and a smaller one to use for the dipping sauce.  Me, I hate washing dishes, so I just put the cooked food in my bowl with the dipping sauce.Having hosted hot pot so many times, I've developed my own set of rules to increase efficiency and decrease chances of foodborne illnesses.Right before guests arrive, start the chicken broth boiling in the hot pot.  Add the white parts of the vegetables and taro to the broth to pre-cook since they will take a little longer to cook through.  You can also add the tofu, tofu puffs, fish balls, and fish cakes since these are not as time sensitive.Have a pot or kettle of boiling water ready to add to the hot pot as the level of the liquid decreases in the pot.I like to use a shot glass, sake cup, or a Chinese soup spoon to hold individual raw eggs as part of each person's place setting.If you are adding raw eggs or egg whites to the hot pot, make sure the water is boiling before you do so.  This is something my mom told me to do, and I think it's because this way it will cook faster and not spread out too much before it gets to cook.  I'm always searching around for my cooked egg enough as it is.Before adding any raw meat or seafood, make sure everyone has had a chance to grab enough food.  This is because you don't want to be getting any food from the hot pot until the meat is cooked through and any bacteria or other fun stuff is all killed off.  Wait until the water is boiling again before removing any further food to eat.  This does create natural pauses during the process, but it should only take a few minutes for the water to re-boil again.  You definitely don't want to let the meat or shrimp to overcook so make sure it gets removed from the hot pot once it is done.  Sometimes I have a larger bowl handy to dump cooked but unclaimed food in so that nothing gets overcooked.  Also, I usually use a chopstick that's different from the ones set out to eat with to use for the raw meat.Don't add the bean thread vermicelli or any other noodles until the really end because the noodles will soak up the liquid in the pot.  My favorite part of hot pot is drinking the delicious broth left in the pot at the very end.  So many yummy ingredients have been cooked in it that it turns into this really fragrant and savory soup full of umami flavoring.My favorite ingredient to add to my hot pot is my mom's pork and fish meatballs.  She taught me how to make these a couple of years ago, and I try to make a batch at the start of every hot pot season not only because they are so good themselves, but also because the water used to cook them is a really good starter broth for hot pot too.  Recently, I called my mom to ask her for the recipe again and it turns out she tweaked it this year to include celery and carrots.My Mom's Hot Pot Meatballsmakes about 24 meatballs1 lb ground pork1 lb fish paste, thawed (sometimes called fish meat emulsion, sold in 16 oz. plastic tubs and usually found near the fish balls in an Asian grocery store)1 large carrot or 2 small carrots, peeled and shredded (optional)3 celery stalks, deveined and finely chopped (optional)1 tablespoon sugar1 egg2 tablespoons fried shallots (also found in Asian grocery stores)2 tablespoons corn starch1 tablespoon sesame oilPepper to taste (my mom uses black, I prefer white)Mix all the ingredients together.  You can taste test the mixture before cooking by microwaving a small teaspoons worth in the microwave for 15-20 seconds.  Adjust seasonings as needed.Drop rounded tablespoons of the mixture into boiling water.  Alternatively, you can roll the meatballs with your hands before dropping into the water.  Stop adding meatballs to the boiling water once you can cover the bottom with a single layer.  The meatballs will be done a minute or two after they start floating.  Remove with slotted spoon and set aside.  Repeat until all meatballs have been cooked.Reserve the broth as a soup base (delicious with sliced daikon and bean thread vermicelli) or as a starter broth for hot pot.The celery and carrots are optional but add some nice color and texture to the meatballs."},
{"title": "Peppermint Ice Cream with Peppermint Candy and Dark Chocolate Flecks", "date": "Wednesday, December 24, 2008", "text": "I've never had the chance to go to a Jeni's Ice Cream which is based in Columbus, OH (what is it with awesome ice cream parlors in Ohio; Graeter's is from Ohio too!), but I've read about how she doesn't make her ice cream with eggs and instead uses cream cheese, cornstarch, and corn syrup in her recipes.  And even though I know people rave about Jeni's, I just can't get over putting corn starch and corn syrup in an ice cream.  I actually can't stand it when I can taste either in my foods; corn starch is usually used to thicken a sauce (Eugene used it on the latest episode of Top Chef and got dinged for it) and corn syrup is a cheaper alternative to sugar and used in American-made Coke (Coke from Mexico uses pure sugar and is soooo much better) and Snapple (which is why I abhor Snapple and love Nantucket Nectar, which uses pure cane sugar).But then I saw this recipe on The Kitchn and just had to try it.  My favorite mint chocolate chip ice cream is made by Breyer's, and I just love the pureness of the mint ice cream (no green food coloring!) and the use of semi-sweet chocolate in it.  I was hoping for something similar with this recipe, and it pretty much came through for me.  I couldn't taste the cream cheese, corn starch, or corn syrup, and best of all, this is another \"makes a little more than one quart\" recipe which means there will be some left in the ice cream machine to eat after you make it.  =)Peppermint Ice Cream with Dark Chocolate Flecks (adapted from here) makes a little more than one quart3 tablespoons cream cheese, softened1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon corn starch3 1/2 cups half and half2/3 cup sugar1 1/2 tablespoons corn syrup1/8 teaspoon salt1 teaspoon peppermint extract1/4 cup crushed peppermint candy (use a Ziploc bag and a hammer or mallet)3 oz. chopped dark chocolateIn the bottom of a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese until soft and loose and set aside.In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of the half and half, making sure the cornstarch is dissolved.  Pour the rest of the half and half into a large pot and whisk in the sugar and corn syrup.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and then simmer, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in the cornstarch mixture.  Return the pot to medium-high heat, bring back to a boil, and cook for 1 more minute, stirring or whisking constantly, until the mixture is slightly thickened. Pour the milk mixture into the bowl with the cream cheese and whisk until the cream cheese is combined.  Add the salt and peppermint extract.  Set the bowl into a larger bowl filled with snow or an ice bath and cool, stirring every few minutes, until the liquid is at least down to room temperature.  Transfer the inner bowl to the refrigerator and allow to chill thoroughly.Freeze in an ice cream maker, adding the peppermint candy and chocolate at the very end.  Transfer the ice cream to a container and freeze for several hours until firm. So in my first attempt to make this, I over-churned the ice cream to the point where it was melting in the machine.  Since I have one of those ice cream makers that uses a frozen canister, there was no way to save it immediately.  The best I could do was re-freeze the canister overnight and try again the next day.  I'm not sure if the reason I over-churned is because either the canister wasn't frozen solid (maybe the freezer door had been left slightly ajar?) or if I was expecting it to start looking like the thick frozen custards I was more used to and it just never did and started going downhill instead.  So to be on the safe side, I froze the ice cream base overnight as well and then put it in the fridge the next morning to thaw so that it would start off very cold.  I had a small hope that I wouldn't need to re-churn the ice cream after freezing the almost liquid base overnight, but that hope was dashed when I checked it in the morning and it was obviously quite quiescently frozen.  =(  About 10 hours after I put it in the fridge to thaw, I tried re-churning it, and it actually came out okay.  Still a bit too many ice crystals for my liking, but definitely better than a solid block of ice.  =)  I think I shall have to try some more of Jeni's ice cream and frozen yogurt recipes.  Or maybe I can adapt one to make a ispahan flavored ice cream!"},
{"title": "Curry Turnovers(?)", "date": "Monday, December 22, 2008", "text": "Okay, so I have no idea what to call these things.  Even in Chinese I've heard them called both jia li jiao and ga li jiao.  I asked my mom if one was Mandarin and the other Taiwanese or Cantonese, but even she admits she doesn't know.  My guess is that the former is Taiwanese Mandarin and the latter possibly Beijing Mandarin or Cantonese.  Anyone know?  Anyways, whatever these things are, they're delicious.  The first time I ever had them my mom made the pastry from scratch, and it was this incredibly complicated process of making two types of dough and then combining them so that you got this extremely flaky crust, kind of like this.  But then one day I was flipping through some old copies of Better Homes and Gardens and noticed that there was this reader submitted recipe for something very similar that just used refrigerated pie crust, and I was sold.  They also used mashed potatoes instead of pieces of cooked potato, but I decided to use mashed potato flakes instead to make it even simpler.The most impressive part of these turnovers is the crimped crust, which of course, my mom taught me how to do.  Here's a quick video to show you how to do it:Curry Turnovers (or whatever they're called)makes about 56 2 packages of refrigerated pie crusts (4 pie crusts total)1 tablespoons vegetable oil1 cup chopped onions4 tablespoons curry powder1 lb. ground beef, 80% lean is good (you don't want to get too lean)4 tablespoons soy sauce1 cup instant mashed potato flakes1 egg yolk, beatenPre-heat the oven to 450° F.Thaw and unwrap the pie crusts.  Unfold and use a cup or cookie cutter to cut out 3\" circles.  Re-roll the excess pie crust and cut more.  You should be able to get around 56 circles.Saute the onions and 1 tablespoon curry powder in the oil until the onions are sweating.  Add the ground beef and continue cooking until beef is brown.  Add soy sauce and more curry powder to taste.Add 1/4 cup potato flakes to bind the mixture.  Continue adding flakes until all the liquid is soaked up and the mixture is no longer crumbly.Place a little less than 1 tablespoon of filling in the middle of each pie crust circle.  Fold in half and pinch the edges to seal.Place the turnovers on a cookie sheet and brush the top of each with the beaten egg yolk.Bake at 450° F for 9 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.The reason for the color difference in the turnovers above is that I used two different brands of pie crust dough:  Pillsbury and Shaws.  Believe it or not, the darker turnovers were made using the Pillsbury brand.  I'm not sure if there is a difference in the thickness of the doughs or more likely the ingredients in the dough, but the Pillsbury brand was a lot easier to shape.  Taste-wise, I think I like the Pillsbury ones better, too; it's just too bad they don't look as nice as the Shaws' ones.  Oh yeah, and personally, I think these taste better once they've cooled down and aren't piping hot anymore.  =)"},
{"title": "Macarons:  A Lesson in Humility", "date": "Thursday, December 18, 2008", "text": "A few months ago Ellen was telling me about her obsession with macarons and how she was going to try to make them.  I wasn't that familiar with these confections although I had seen plenty of beautiful pictures of them on other food blogs.  Turns out that 1) they are another species entirely from the coconut macaroons (two o's) that I'm used to, and 2) supposed to be incredibly difficult to make.  Naturally, that meant I was going to try at some point.So first of all, macarons are made with almond flour, sugar, and egg whites, whipped to a meringue.  They are then sandwiched with the an appropriate filling (ganache, buttercream, jam, curd, etc.) and the resulting sandwich is also (confusingly) called a macaron.  An unique feature of the macaron cookie is called the \"feet\"--the uneven, ruffled skirt around the edge.  Amazingly enough, you want feet on your macarons.  The hard part about making a macaron mostly involves the meringue and folding in the tant-pour-tant (the one-to-one mixture of almond flour and sugar).  One fold too many or too little will result in cracked and/or hollow cookies and no feet.Another difficult part about making macarons is amassing the ingredients and tools needed to make them.  Egg whites aren't hard to come by, but one tip that has been circulating around is that they should be \"aged\" at room temperature at least overnight and up to 72 hours.  Sure it sounds disgusting, but any germs and bacteria that might grow would be killed in the oven and the aged egg whites hold a meringue that much better because more water has evaporated, leaving more of the structural proteins.  Next, almond flour.  If you can't find any you can always make it yourself with almonds and a food processor (although I'm not sure how you would get almond flour vs. almond butter) but luckily enough, Harvest carries almond meal in their bulk bins.  Unfortunately, the almonds aren't skinned beforehand, so there's flecks of almond skin in the meal, but what can you do?  (Actually, now that I think about it, maybe I can sieve the meal beforehand to try to get rid of the skin....)  Anyways, you'll want to use the food processor to grind the meal even finer.  One great tip I read is to use the food processor to mix the almond flour and powdered sugar so that you don't have to individually sift the two (which is great because I don't have a sifter, although I guess a sieve would work).To make the macarons you need a mixer (a stand mixer is ideal but I'm too cheap so I just used a hand mixer), pastry bag (again, too cheap to buy so I just filled a large Ziploc bag and cut a hole in the corner), high quality baking sheets (I used my Pampered Chef stoneware cookie sheet), parchment paper, Silpat, or non-stick aluminum foil (I used parchment paper), a food processor (thanks, Carsten!), a candy thermometer, and ideally, a food scale.You can tell it's an Italian meringue because it is so glossy.There are two ways of making meringue for the macarons, the French way or the Italian way.  The Italian way is a little more difficult and involves streaming boiling sugar syrup into the egg whites are they are being whipped but results in almost foolproof macarons as the Italian meringue is much more stable than French meringue.  So I chose to try the Italian method.  Since I didn't have a food scale (yes, I am cheap!) I used Lesley's recipe here which is \"translated\" from Tartelette's and decided to try my hand at making a hazelnut macaron with Nutella filling.Yes, you can see the specks of almond skin, but look, you can see feet as well!Hazelnut Macarons (based on Lesley's recipe) Ingredients:1/2 cup aged egg whites (comes out to about 4 egg whites)3 T sugar1 1/4 cups powdered sugar1 cup almond meal2 tsp. hazelnut extractFor syrup:3/4 cups sugar1/4 cups waterBegin by placing the water and sugar for the syrup in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Once the sugar syrup registers 170° F on a candy thermometer, start whipping two of your egg whites.  When the egg whites have started to froth, slowly add the 3 T sugar.When the sugar syrup gets to 230° F on a candy thermometer, add it in driblets to your egg whites (which should hold soft peaks at this point).Whip the mixture for 10 - 15 minutes, until cool.Mix the remaining egg whites with the almond meal and powdered sugar in a food processor.  Fold this mixture and the hazelnut extract into the meringue mixture.Fill a pastry bag with a 1/4 inch tip (or a large Ziploc bag with a corner snipped off) with your mixture.  Pipe 1\" circles on cookie sheets lined with parchment paper, non-stick aluminum foild, or Silpat. Bake at 320° F for 12 - 15 minutes.  After they are done baking, allow them to cool and carefully transfer them to an airtight container.  Macarons can be stored in the fridge or freezer.I made the filling used in the picture above with this recipe, but in the end, I decided I liked just plain Nutella as a filling.  I forgot to mention that I had never actually had a macaron before, so I was quite surprised at how sweet it was with my first bite.  But after a while I knew what to expect, and it might have helped that I was eating them chilled from the freezer (the colder something is, the less sweet it will taste; one reason why there is so much sugar in an ice cream recipe).So ta-da!  I made my first batch and didn't have too many issues:  my macarons had feet, weren't hollow, and didn't have any cracks.  The hardest part was actually piping the cookies as I had never piped anything before in my life, and I wasn't exactly using the best tool.  The macaron batter is actually quite drippy so you really have to be careful if you aren't using a pastry tip.  I would definitely recommend having your parchment paper already cut and spread out so that you can pipe all the macarons at one time.  One site I read recommending drawing 1\" circles onto the paper beforehand so you know when to stop piping and also where to place them.  Another tip that I read on many, many sites is to let the macarons sit for an hour before putting them in the oven so that the top can dry out.  I didn't really adhere to this with my first batch as I figured that by the time I had piped the last macaron, the first one would have already had a chance to sit a bit.Piped orange macarons (although not very orange in color)So now that I had one good batch under my belt, I figured it was time to try a different flavor, and I settled on orange macarons with clementine curd using the recipe here.  I added orange extract to the macaron batter and used food coloring to try to get them orange.  I'm not used to using food coloring, and even though I read that baked macarons come out much lighter than the batter, I was just too scared to get much color into the cookies.  And this time I decided to let them sit after being piped.  Well I think that was a mistake.  Of the four trays I made, only the first one came out without cracks, and I'm pretty sure that was because that one didn't sit as long as the others.  Even so, the macarons from the first tray were almost all hollow.  =(  I was able to salvage a few to take pictures of, but the rest I'm just eating individually and dipping into the curd like chips and dip.  I also need to find a filling that's not as runny.  As you can see in the picture below, the curd is starting to drip out the sides and one of the principles of macaron making is that the filling should never go past the circumference of the cookie.Orange macarons with clementine curdNow I understand the angst of making macarons; even the \"almost fool-proof\" recipes can go horribly wrong.  But I'm not entirely defeated; I think I'll try to make more macarons in the next few days.  I even have the egg whites sitting out already.  It's really too bad Highrock is a nut-free church or else I'd bring some for people to try.  Anyone have any ideas for other flavor combinations?  I might try a peppermint macaron and chocolate ganache combo  or maybe a coconut macaron with orange marshmallow creme filling....P.S.  I tried the peppermint macarons with peppermint chocolate ganache!"},
{"title": "Pork and Cabbage Dumplings", "date": "Monday, December 15, 2008", "text": "Another favorite thing my mom makes are her dumplings.  She also taught me how to wrap them, and I've definitely become something of a dumpling wrapping nazi when I'm at dumpling making parties.  I really, really don't like the dumplings without pleats, the ones that just lay there on its side looking so pitiful.  Not only do they just not look like real dumplings, they can't sit upright so they take up more space both on the tray and in the frying pan.  This is a problem because a) you don't want the fresh dumplings to touch one another or else they will stick together, and b) you want the dumplings to be able to stand upright on the frying pan so that you can fry the bottom and steam the rest (I'll tell you how below).And while I'm on the topic of personal preferences, I like my dumplings thin-skinned.  Not really sure why, other than it's a texture preference.  I also do not like the ones with Chinese chives--the flavor is way too strong!  I find that pork and cabbage are the perfect fillers because they are innocuous enough to deliver the flavors of the seasonings used.  Another weird quirk of mine:  I don't like black pepper.  But to compensate I use white pepper which is a little less piquant.A couple of tips for making dumplings:If you don't have a food processor (I didn't have one for years until Carsten gave me his, thanks Carsten!) you can use a blender for the cabbage and scallions, but you'll need to add water so that the cabbage and stuff can move around.  Just make sure you squeeze out the water thoroughly afterwards.  I haven't tried using a blender to mince ginger, but I have a feeling it wouldn't work properly.  Fortunately, there is much less ginger than cabbage to mince, and there's always the chef's knife and a cutting board.To taste test the filling, just microwave a teaspoon or so for about 20 seconds.  Yes, this is a tip from my mom.  Isn't she the smartest?You want the filling to be moist, but not swimming in liquid because the excess liquid will often seep out of the wrapped dumplings and cause them to stick to each other.  If you see a lot of excess liquid in your filling, transfer it into a sieve placed over a bowl (but not touching the bottom of the bowl).  The liquid will seep out on its own, and you'll be back in business.  Another way my mom combats this issue is to add bean thread vermicelli so that it soaks up some of the liquid.  It also adds a wonderful dimension to the texture of the filling.One of the hardest parts of folding a dumpling properly is getting the skin pliant enough.  If you have really fresh dumpling skins, this won't be an issue as they'll be elastic enough for you to stretch and fold to your heart's content.  If they've been in the fridge or freezer for a while, one way to get the edges softer is to wet them with warm water before you add the filling so they have some time to soften.To keep the freshly-wrapped dumplings from sticking to each other, place a few tablespoons of flour on the tray you'll be using to set the dumplings on after you wrap them.  Dip each dumpling in the flour so that the bottom won't stick to the tray.  Make sure that when you set them down they don't touch each other.  When the tray is filled with fresh dumplings and if you are planning on freezing the dumplings, place the tray in the freezer for about 15 minutes or until they are starting to feel a little stiff.  Then pop them in a freezer bag or Tupperware and put back in the freezer.Here is a quick video (thanks Annie for her videography skills) for how to wrap the dumplings.  I'm especially proud of the serendipitous Taiwan-shaped imprint I leave in the flour after dipping my dumpling.  You can also check out step-by-step photos for how to wrap starting here.    My Mom's Pork and Cabbage Dumplingsmakes about 124 dumplings2.5 lbs. ground pork1 medium head of napa cabbage, roughly chopped4 scallions, roughly chopped1 tablespoon ginger, peeled and roughly sliced2 bundles of bean thread vermicelli (dong fen)3/4 cup soy sauce6 tablespoons sesame oil2 teaspoons white pepper3 tablespoons sugar124 round dumpling wrappers (2 packs)flour1)  Soak the bean thread vermicelli in a bowl filled with hot water for 15 minutes.2)  While the vermicelli is soaking, use a food processor to mince the cabbage, scallions, and ginger.  Transfer to a large mixing bowl by handfuls, squeezing out the extra water.3)  Squeeze out the excess water in the vermicelli and use the food processor to chop into about 1/2\" pieces.  Add to the mixing bowl.4)  Add the ground pork, soy sauce, sesame oil, white pepper, and sugar to the bowl and mix well.  Taste test the filling by microwaving about a teaspoon of the mixture for about 20 seconds and tasting the result.  Add more soy sauce, sesame oil, pepper, or sugar as necessary.5)  Prepare plates or trays with flour for dipping and have a small bowl of warm water ready.  Hold the wrapper in one hand and use the other to dip a finger in the water and wet the edges of the wrapper.  Put a spoonful of the filling in the middle of the wrapper and fold in half.  Seal center portion of the joined edges.  Make two pleats on both the left and right side of the dumpling.  Make sure that the whole thing is totally sealed and then dip the bottom in the flour and place on the tray.  Repeat 123 times.6)  Once a tray is filled, if you are planning on freezing the dumplings, place it in your freezer and work on the next tray.  By the time the second tray is ready, the dumplings on the first tray should be solid enough to place in a freezer bag.  I usually add another tablespoon of flour to the bag just to make sure that nothing sticks together.7)  To boil the dumplings (i.e. to make shui jiao):  bring a pot of water to boiling.  Drop the frozen or fresh dumplings in and stir occasionally to make sure they don't stick to one another.  After a few minutes, they will start to float, and they are ready once the skin is swollen (a few minutes after they start to float).8)  To pan-fry the dumplings (i.e. to make guo tie):  heat a frying pan on high and add oil once it is hot.  Once the oil is hot (I sprinkle a few drops of water onto the pan and wait for them to sizzle and evaporate), add the dumplings one at a time so that they are sitting upright.  Once the bottoms are browned, add about a 1/2 cup of water (for 8 dumplings, my usual serving size).  If you like your guo tie extra crispy, add 1 T of flour or cornstarch to the water and mix to get rid of the lumps before you add it to the pan.  Be very careful as the steam coming off the pan may burn you.  Cover and let cook for a few minutes until the water is almost all gone.  Remove the lid and let the rest of the water cook off.9)  Serve with a dipping sauce.  Straight soy sauce works, but if you have the time, add some vinegar, sesame oil, and sugar."},
{"title": "Pan-Fried Pasta with Butternut Squash, Fried Sage, and Pine Nuts", "date": "Wednesday, December 10, 2008", "text": "One of my favorite cooking sites is The Kitchn because not only are they generally socially conscious (advocating fresh, in-season, locally grown products, farmer's markets, CSAs, etc.) but because they also update several times a day so almost every time I check back, they have something new to read.  I often find the inspiration to try a new dish there, and so far this one has been my favorite.  I brought it to small group once, and someone who didn't think she liked squash said that she loved the dish.  I gave them the recipe, and I know it's been made multiple times since.It's a little too late to find butternut squash at the farmer's market now, but I know they're still being sold in the supermarkets.  If you really want to save time (although probably not money), you can buy the squash all peeled and cut up already.  But if you want to peel and cut it up yourself, this is what I usually do:Cut off the top (so that you have an edge to start peeling from) and bottom (so that you have a level surface to stand the squash upright).Use a vegetable peeler (I use a Palm Peeler which was given to me by jalzee--one of the most useful gifts ever!) and peel the skin from top to bottom, going around the whole squash.  You may find that you will need to do several layers before you get past the pale skin and to the brighter colored and softer flesh.  Alternatively, you can just peel using a knife, but I find using a peeler is safer and less wasteful.Cut the squash in half horizontally (along the equator), then cut each half in half vertically.  Scoop out the seeds and icky stuff from the cavity of the bottom part.Slice the squash into 1\" wide sticks and then turn the stick 90 degrees and cut into 1\" chunks.Pan-Fried Pasta with Butternut Squash, Fried Sage, and Pine Nuts (adapted from The Kitchn)Makes 4-6 servings  1 medium butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1\" pieces1 small sweet onion, peeled and diced3 cloves garlic, mincedOlive oilSalt and pepper1/2 cup fresh sage leaves1 pound farfalle pasta3/4 cup pine nuts4 ounces high quality Parmesan, shredded or shaved (I actually like less)Heat the oven to 375°.Mince about half of the fresh sage leaves and toss with the butternut squash, onion, garlic, a drizzle of olive oil, salt and pepper.  Spread the squash mixture in a thin layer on a large baking sheet and roast for about 40 minutes or until the squash is soft.In the meantime, heat up a large, high-sided, un-oiled sauté pan until hot and toss in the nuts.  Try to spread them out in a single layer and stir every 30 seconds or so until browned and you can smell the nutty aroma.  These burn rather quickly so make sure you are paying attention!  When toasted, set aside.Heat salted pasta water to boiling and cook the farfalle until al dente.  Drain and set aside.As the squash finishes roasting, heat about two tablespoons of olive oil in the sauté pan.  The oil is ready when it pops and sputters.  (Don't let it start smoking.)  Drop in the rest of the sage leaves and fry for about a minute, or until they begin to just shrivel up.  Remove with a slotted spoon (leaving the sage-seasoned olive oil in the pan) and salt lightly.  Crush with the back of a spoon.Add half the pasta to the pan, along with half the roasted squash mixture.  Crumble in half the sage.  Cook, stirring frequently, for five minutes or until the pasta is heated through and getting crispy on some of the edges.  Add the pine nuts and cook for another minute.  Stir in half the cheese, salt to taste, and serve.Repeat the last step with the rest of the ingredients.  It's very important that you not crowd the pan too much - you want the pasta to really pan-fry, not just steam up."},
{"title": "Beef Noodle (Soup) and Lu Dan", "date": "Monday, December 8, 2008", "text": "My mom is the best cook I know, and I'm not just saying that because she's my mom.  Not only doe she make some awesomely impressive dishes for potlucks and the like, she also makes awesome everyday dishes just for us, and the best thing is, she's self-taught.  One of the dishes that my brother and I always demand she makes when we're home is niu rou mian, or Taiwanese beef noodle soup.  Actually, the translation is a little misleading because it's not exactly niu rou tang mian (tang means soup in Mandarin).  The dish my mom makes doesn't have a whole lot of soup (although you could just add beef broth if you wanted, I suppose), it's more like a healthy amount of sauce.One change I made to her recipe is that I used chuck beef instead of beef shank because I'm not a big fan of all the jing, which is the chewy gross stuff that is probably tendons and junk that other people seem to really like.  So yeah, if you like that junk, use beef shank, which comes out much more tender, or maybe that's just because my mom made it.My Mom's Taiwanese Beef Noodle (Soup)makes 6 servings2 scallions, chopped4 garlic cloves, chopped1 teaspoon ginger, minced1 star anise2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 1/2 lbs. chuck beef (or beef shank) cut into 3/4\" pieces1/2 cup rice wine1/2 cups soy sauce1 1/4 cup water3 tablespoons rock sugar or brown sugar1 tomato, skinned and roughly chopped (optional)1 lb. angel hair pasta1 small head napa cabbage, washed and cut into 3\" piecesIn large saucepan, saute the first four ingredients the oil for 2 minutes.  Add the beef and cook until just browned.Add the wine, soy sauce, water, and sugar, and tomato (if using) and heat to boiling.  Reduce to a simmer and cook with the lid on for 1-2 hours (1 hour is enough for chuck beef, may need 2 hours for beef shank).Fifteen minutes before beef is done, boil water in a large pot.  Add pasta and cook while stirring occasionally for 3 minutes.  Add napa cabbage and cook for 2 more minutes.  Drain off most of the water.Divide the noodles and cabbage among 6 large bowls, adding a little of the excess hot water.  Add the beef on top and ladle in some of the sauce (making sure to remove the star anise).Another Taiwanese food I really like is lu dan, or soy sauce braised eggs.  In Taiwan, these are so common you can get them at the ubiquitous 7-Elevens, but it's darn near impossible to find them here unless you make them yourself.  Since I had a large amount of soy sauce mixture left from making the beef noodles, I decided to make some.  (Note: these are different form cha dan, or tea eggs, in that 1) there is tea in the braising sauce for tea eggs, and 2) the egg shells are not completely removed for making tea eggs.)Soy Sauce Braised Eggs1)  Add eggs to a pot of cold water.  Bring the water to a boil and reduce to a simmer.  Cook for 12-15 minutes.  Transfer eggs to a bowl full of cold water to cool.2)  Once eggs are not hot to the touch, peel them.3)  Heat the soy sauce mixture leftover from beef to boiling.  Reduce to a simmer and add the peeled eggs.  If the level of the liquid does not cover the eggs, make sure to rotate the eggs throughout the braising process.  Braise for 30 minutes.That's it!  You can probably braise the eggs in a straight mixture of soy sauce, water, and sugar (i.e. without braising beef or some other kind of meat in the liquids first), but for some reason, I've only had them cooked in a mixture that had first been used to cook something else.  Hmmm, maybe it's because it's a Taiwanese thing, and we're kinda cheap and efficient like that.  =P"},
{"title": "Salted Butter Caramel Ice Cream", "date": "Wednesday, December 3, 2008", "text": "I don't remember when I first stumbled upon this recipe, but I do know that I've been wanting to make it ever since I first heard of it.  I guess it was the whole making caramel thing that scared me off--one second too long on the stove and you end up with burnt sugar (although the burnt caramel ice cream flavor from Toscanini's is actually one of my favorites).  But after I ran out of my last pint of Haagen-Dazs Sticky Toffee Pudding ice cream, I needed something equally as decadent so I decided to finally try to make this, and I am so glad I did!Let not the caramel making process scare you off, although I would shy away from it if you only have an electric stove as you really need to be able to control the heat.  Just make sure you pay attention with your eyes and your nose.  As soon as you start to smell something like burnt sugar, take it off the heat.  As I read somewhere else, it is better to err on the side of burnt than to have only slightly browned sugar.I didn't have any fleur de sel so I just used kosher salt, but whatever you do, do not use regular table salt; you need something refined and flaky here.  I also didn't have any salted butter so I just used unsalted and added a pinch more salt, even though I still can't taste the salt in the finished product, so perhaps next time I will add a little extra.  (Yes, it may sound gross, but I'm the girl that adds a sprinkle of sea salt to my chocolate ice cream; it's so good, you must try it!)  The most drastic substitution I had to make was half and half for the heavy cream, but I think the ice cream turned out just fine and in fact maybe hardens a little more because of the greater water to fat ratio.  This is a good thing because the large amount of sugar in the recipe keeps the texture very creamy and not as hard as I usually like my ice cream.Salted Butter Caramel Ice Cream (based on David Lebovitz's recipe)Makes one generous quart*For the caramel praline (mix-in):½ cup (100 gr) sugar¾ teaspoon kosher or sea salt, such as fleur de selFor the ice cream custard:2 cups (500 ml) whole milk, divided1½ cups (300 gr) sugar4 tablespoons (60 gr) butterscant ½ teaspoon sea salt1 cups (250 ml) heavy cream (or half and half)5 large egg yolks¾ teaspoon vanilla extract1. To make the caramel praline, spread the ½ cup (100 gr) of sugar in an even layer in a medium-sized, unlined heavy duty saucepan.  Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or brush it sparingly with unflavored oil.2. Heat the sugar over moderate heat until the edges begin to melt. Use a heatproof utensil to gently stir the liquefied sugar from the bottom and edges towards the center, stirring, until all the sugar is dissolved. (Or most of it—there may be some lumps, which will melt later.)Continue to cook, stirring infrequently, until the caramel starts smoking and begins to smell like it's just about to burn.  It won't take long.3. Without hesitation, sprinkle in the ¾ teaspoon salt without stirring (don't even pause to scratch your nose), then pour the caramel onto the prepared baking sheet and lift up the baking sheet immediately, tilting and swirling it almost vertically to encourage the caramel to form as thin a layer as possible. Set aside to harden and cool.4. To make the ice cream, make an ice bath by filling a large bowl about a third full with ice cubes and adding a cup or so of water so they're floating.  Nest a smaller metal bowl (at least 2 quarts/liters) over the ice, pour 1 cup (250 ml) of the milk into the inner bowl, and rest a mesh strainer on top of it.5. Spread 1½ cups (300 gr) sugar in the saucepan in an even layer.  Cook over moderate heat, until caramelized, using the same method described in Step #2.6. Once caramelized, remove from heat and stir in the butter and salt, until butter is melted, then gradually whisk in the cream, stirring as you go.  This is one of the most dramatic reactions in the kitchen so please be careful and go slowly!The caramel may harden and seize, but return it to the heat and continue to stir over low heat until any hard caramel is melted.  Stir in 1 cup (250 ml) of the milk.7. Whisk the yolks in a small bowl and gradually pour some of the warm caramel mixture over the yolks, stirring constantly.  Scrape the warmed yolks back into the saucepan and cook the custard using a heatproof utensil, stirring constantly (scraping the bottom as you stir) until the mixture thickens.  If using an instant-read thermometer, it should read 160-170 F (71-77 C).8. Pour the custard through the strainer into the milk set over the ice bath, add the vanilla, then stir frequently until the mixture is cooled down.  Refrigerate at least 8 hours or until thoroughly chilled.9. Freeze the mixture in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.10. While the ice cream is churning, crumble the hardened caramel praline into very little bits, about the size of very large confetti (about ½-inch, or 1 cm).11. Once your caramel ice cream is churned, quickly stir in the crushed caramel, then chill in the freezer until firm.Note: As the ice cream sits, the little bits of caramel may liquefy and get runny and gooey, which is what they're intended to do.  One day after I had made the ice cream, the caramel was still quite hard, but I'm hoping that will change as it continues to sit, although I'm not sure how long it will last!*One of hardest parts of making ice cream is the patience factor.  Not only do you have to wait for the mixture to chill in the fridge before you start churning (can take up to 8 hours!) but you have to wait again after you churn it for it to harden up.  However, I've found that after transferring the just-churned ice cream to a container to freeze, the leftover ice cream stuck to the sides of the ice cream maker cannister is already hard enough to eat!  This recipe is perfect because after filling up a quart-sized container there is enough left in the cannister for a full serving of the yummiest ice cream you may ever make.  Thanks so much for the recipe, David!"},
{"title": "Homemade Crystallized Ginger", "date": "Wednesday, November 12, 2008", "text": "I used to really hate ginger, mostly because my mom would use it a lot in her cooking, and I'd always end up with a huge chunk of it in my mouth.  But since I've started traveling so much, I always make sure I have a bag of crystallized ginger or ginger candy on me in case my stomach feels queasy.  So I was really excited to find this recipe for homemade crystallized ginger on The Kitchn yesterday.  It's super simple, and best of all, you get ginger syrup as a byproduct!  This is the stuff that they add to dou hua (tofu pudding) in the winter, and it's just amazing how it will warm you up. Serendipitously, as I was walking to the dentist yesterday from work, I passed the Chang Shing Tofu factory just as someone was coming out for a smoke.  Four years ago, I had tried to buy tofu from there because I had heard tales of MIT students doing so, but could never figure out how to get past the locked front doors that didn't have a doorbell.  So this is a quest four years in the making, my friends.  I excitedly asked the guy if I could buy tofu, and he said in broken English that I should go to the door.  I went to the same front doors I had tried years earlier, and wouldn't you know it, they were still locked.  But then I heard the guy telling me to go down to the next door.  There's another door?  About half a block down next to the garage door, there's a little door (that does have a doorbell next to it) that was...unlocked! So I went in and am immediately confronted with another guy packing tofu into these large containers.  I timidly ask him if I can buy tofu here, and he kind of gestures for me to go further in.  I start wandering around by myself, and it's just a bunch of big machines with guys working them and ignoring me for the most part.  I feel as intimidated as I do when I'm in a Home Depot.  After wandering through a few rooms without finding anything that looks like a storefront, I wander back to the first guy and ask again.  He stops what he's doing for a second, opens the door to the outside, and sets off some sort of buzzer (okay, maybe he just rang the doorbell, but it looked more complicated than that).  Finally, this guy from another section comes over, and I ask again if it's possible to buy tofu here.  He indicates a product listing on the wall, and happily tofu pudding is listed.  So I buy a container from him and head back out to coldness that is Cambridge in November.  Mission:  accomplished!Back to the ginger:  make sure you pick roots that are young and firm (vs. old and spongy).  It is easier to peel big bulbs, and the best tip I ever picked up is to peel the ginger with the edge of a metal spoon instead of a knife or peeler.  The skin is so thin it comes off super easily, and a spoon is much easier to handle when you get to the weird crevices.  One change I made to the recipe is that I used rock sugar (the big yellow crystals you find in a box at Asian grocery stores) because I like the flavor better.Homemade Crystallized Ginger (adapted from The Kitchn)1 1/2 cups water1 1/2 cups rock sugar, plus extra white sugar for coating1 cup peeled ginger, sliced into 1/8 inch strips or coinsCombine water and 1 1/2 cups rock sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add ginger, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 minutes.Using chopsticks, transfer ginger pieces onto parchment paper.Let stand until dry, turning over if necessary, and then roll slices in white sugar.Store in an airtight container for up to three months.The next time I make this, I will see if I can get away with not rolling it in sugar at the end, so I get something more akin to Trader Joe's Uncrystallized Candied Ginger.  Since the ginger is quite tacky after the sugaring process, I might need to coat it with something so that it's not so sticky, though.  Maybe a light dusting of a mixture of confectioner's sugar and corn starch....For the tofu pudding, I just scooped some out and plopped it into a bowl and then drizzled the ginger syrup on top.  That's it!  Ah, sweet happiness that can be found in a bowl....  =)"}
