{"title": "On the Slipmat with Saturn: a Gorillaz-inspired microstory", "date": "Jan 5, 2024", "text": "I found the following text in my blog drafts. It was an attempt at a picture story, a little micro-fiction slash thought poem, with added pretty pics. The images are taken from the video for Saturnz Barz by Gorillaz, which came out when I wrote this piece seven years ago. Time to finally publish it.On the Slipmat with SaturnI was browsing someone else's record collection. Leafing through the seven-inches, flipping them to check the b-sides. You only really know someone by the quality of their b-sides.There was still something thrilling about placing the record over the spindle. The satisfying 'clump' as the disc settles onto the slipmat. A physical experience before a single note has hit you.The needle travelled the grooves as the music played. A seemingly endless spiral. Satisfaction in ever-decreasing circles. My mind wandered more freely than that. Lost in eddies and twirls, beyond geometry. \"You like it when my record goes round, huh?\" The fifty-foot worm appeared from nowhere. It seemed flattered. A kindred spirit, connected in musical taste if not in anatomy. I handled it well. My screams were in tune with the music.How we listened. Let the bass shake us. We jumped between tracks together, hand and tentacle on stylus. Our minds found a rhythm. We travelled to space. Rockets and planets and nebula, playing music in the infinite vacuum with my huge bendy friend.You can plan your days. Play the music you want to listen to. But sometimes the needle doesn't go the way you want it to. Life can become the b-side. You will know this has happened when you find yourself travelling along a different kind of spiral.Me and the worm. And the satisfying 'clump' as a new record begins.Pictured: A hyperfuturistic digital 3D rendering of the worm from the Gorillaz videoFurther Fats: I got the pop song, I got the melody (about earworms, 2011)Further Fats: Story: A meeting regarding new material by the electronic music producer Aphex Twin (2020)"},
{"title": "Muskering, sorry, mustering up the courage for 2024", "date": "Dec 31, 2023", "text": "Hello, it's Fat Roland here. You can think of me as your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man. Except without the spiders. Or being in your neighbourhood. And I'm not sure how friendly I am. Am I even a man?I'm always sceptical about the effectiveness of new years' resolutions, and I certainly didn't have 2023 down as my \"stroke year\". But let's play some lip service to this annual festival of arbitrary date-based life curation. Here are ten resolutions I have for 2024. And because I like to cheat, I've made a start on some of these already.Resolution one. Embrace colour. I wore black for years, but the Johnny Cash aesthetic doesn't really suit my mood. I'm not saying I want to look like Timmy Mallett mating with the Teletubbies, but splashes of colour would be welcome in 2024.Resolution two. Come up with more contemporary references than Timmy Mallett and the Teletubbies. That said, Mallett has an endearing TikTok account. Not sure about the social status of Dipsy's gang.Resolution three. Build on my amazing day job. This isn't the most exciting of resolutions. It's a bit like a plumber wishing for more pipes. But I enjoy my work at the Burgess Foundation, and I want to push myself to be more efficient and more creative and more of an ultraviolent droog. Watch out for your kneecaps!Resolution four. Let writing become the fulcrum of my artistic, erm, lever or something. I really should have looked up the word 'fulcrum' in a dictionary before writing this. I continue my scribbling for Electronic Sound, and in 2024 I shall return to writing short stories. Performance is also a Thing in my life, with a capital T, and I'm sure this will happen to. But writing comes first.Resolution sixteen. (I've lost count.) Get cartooning again. Drawing my eggs on social media (see my previous blog post) was a way back into restarting the broken visual section of my brain. Expect more of this in 2024. Not professionally. Just faffing. Proper good faffing.Resolution five hundred and ninety six. Be healthy. I did not do a good job of this in 2023. Stupid brain. But this is not just about a better body, although a healthy(ish) lifestyle will certainly help. Better living space, better relationships, better downtime, the whole holistic sausage. No pressure or anything, but if I do not do this exactly right, I will give everyone on earth a million pounds.Resolution infinity plus three, and this is related to the previous resolution. Don't have another stroke. This seems obvious, but writing this down makes it official. At some point in 2024, my brain is going to read this back and decide, \"Yeah, Fats, that's a cracking idea. Let's not have another stroke.\"Resolution alpha epsilon followed by the eye of Horus. Social media has become a big pile of meh. This scrolling world of ours is fractured, and any one social media platform is not the behemoth it was. The only way to get traction is to personally fist dollar bills into Elon Musk's trousers on the daily. I will post, of course, because people seem to like it. But... let's hold it lightly.Resolution a badly drawn picture of an egg. Learn to count. I mean, seriously. I know most of the numbers. Seven. Is seven a number? I'm going to buy a calculator every day until I learn to count to ten.Resolution ten. Yes! I did it! Carry on blogging. Sorry to disappoint you with this, but this tired old blog will drag itself onwards like a knackered horse attempting a never-ending lap of the glue factory. This has been my worst complete blogging year in history but HEY, I HAVE REASONS FOR THAT. However, this is my home, and this is where my words belong, and I am grateful for your visit.Happy new year.

Everything is full of eggs. As readers of this blog will know, I've had quite a year. My brain went bang and I've been recovering ever since. To be fair to my brain, it is doing a brilliant job of helping me recover even though it's my stupid brain that caused all this trouble in the first place. I am working again, and writing, and going to gigs, and doing many things a normal human would do.I've been slower to get back to cartooning. Lots of screen time makes me tired. When I'm creating cartoons digitally, that involves peering at pixels for long stretches of time. This is no good. I had to come up with a way of getting back to cartooning that wouldn't overwhelm me.The solution? Eggs. Lots of eggs. They are easy to draw. There is no shape more simple than an egg shape. This is geometric fact. Look at triangles: eeeugh, they're so complex and full of angles. Unlike an egg, which is easy. Anyone can draw an egg, even if they have a brain made of bent spanners.My egg series has been published on my social media throughout this month, It is, of course, advent themed. \"Eggvent.\" There has been a nativity shepherd that's an egg. Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer that's an egg. The robot from the Dr Who episode 'Wild Blue Yonder'... that's also an egg with a Chrimbo hat on.The latest one is the Christmas chart topping London band East 17 as eggs. Who, of course, had an excellent hit single with the chorus \"Everybody in the house of l'oeuf.\" I just thought of that on the spot. Maybe my brain isn't so spannered after all.What's next? I could do other foodstuffs. Potatoes. They're kind of egg-shaped. Sausages. They're just oblong eggs. Broccoli? No, way too complicated.Follow my egg exploits (my eggsploits) on Twitter (X), Instagram, Facebook or Bluesky.Further eggy Fats: Weebl & Bob pimp kudos joy (2005)Further eggy Fats: This is what happens when I change my Facebook profile picture (2014)"},
{"title": "Ancient potted shrubbery: some thoughts on the new Beatles track", "date": "Nov 27, 2023", "text": "The brand new Beatles song Now And Then caused quite the stir. The lost Lennon song returned them to the number one spot for the first time since 1969. That's an awfully long time. To be fair, Free As A Bird should have been top of the pops in 1995, but the exorable Earth Song kept it off number one.I should be frothing at the gills for a new single by the Beatles. Truth is, the Beatles never really excited me. Yeah, I know their place in history. Their phenomenal production techniques, their tape-twisting sonic savviness, the blueprint they set for the rest of time. But songs about submarines and octopuses seemed so childish. Says the man who owns numerous cartoon rave singles.I spent many of my younger years in the Manchester Boys Choir, a well-regarded choir that hit the buffers when its choirmaster turned out to be a wrong 'un. My overwhelming memory of our repertoire was singing the iconic Beatles song Yesterday over and over again. And again. And again. This was not a good thing. It quashed any kind of Beatlemania I could have developed as a child.As a fan of dance music, I should be into the Beatles by law. The references throughout the history of electronic bleeps are legion. The Chemical Brothers paid tribute to the Beatles on more than one occasion, from aping Tomorrow Never Knows for Setting Sun, to dropping in a snippet of Revolution 9 into Chemical Beats. Danger Mouse spliced The White Album with Jay Z for The Grey Album, one of the most interesting mash-up albums. You can hear a bit of the Beatles in the Black Dog's Book Of Dogma, and on UNKLE's Psyence Fiction album. And Massive Attack directly referenced Here Comes The Sun on their Blue Lines album.Having said all this, a few years ago, I did make a video about the Beatles. It called The Fabulous Four, made for a project called Let The Artists In. The cartoon video has television snakes, ancient potted shrubbery, a safety-conscious canary, and an unexpected fourth member of the Beatles. Absolute glorious nonsense. And quite fitting too: I have a copy of John Lennon's In His Own Write, which is also full of cartoon daftery.Incidentally, the silly Ringo reference in the video was taken from my Seven Inch show (2018/2019). The Beatles sketches featured in the video are the actual A3 cartoon props used in that show.There you go. A blog post about the Beatles.

I am really, really into Underworld. I've listened to loads of their songs. Like, more than ten of them. I've followed them from before you even grew ears. And I failed to get tickets. Call myself a fan? This is pathetic.The news of their latest show passed me by. I must have received an email, but it was subsumed into a mire of spam messages and mailing list gunk. I must have been pinged by Facebook, or poked or shanked or whatever Facebook does these days. But the notification would have been lost in an endless scrolling carousel of political memes and nostalgia clickbaits.So if you are selling a ticket for Underworld's Manchestet show in April 2024, here are ten things I would be willing to trade in return for said ticket:An armA legOne little fingerThat green patch on my shoulder that seems to change shape every dayMy shadowAll but three of my regretsMy ability to taste semolinaA greckel, whatever that isThe angry accountant that lives in my loft because I demand to have prime numbers shouted at me every 41 secondsThe value of the ticketThe Underworld gig is at Aviva Studios, Manchester's brand new mega-venue run by Factory International. I went there for Danny Boyle's Free Your Mind, a dance show based on The Matrix and Alan Turing. Which sounds awful, and the second half was ropey, but the first half was mesmerising and full of surprises.Also I had two interesting encounters at the Danny Boyle show. One: I met a giant rabbit. Two: I met Danny Boyle. I only have a picture of one of these encounters, as you can see in the picture above. I wonder if the rabbit had an Underworld ticket. Hmmm. Should have checked its pockets.Note to self: Always check rabbit pockets for elusive merch.DRIFT Series 1 -  Complete by Underworld"},
{"title": "A yammer about planners and crammers", "date": "Sep 30, 2023", "text": "There are two ways of approaching deadlines. There's planning, and then there's cramming.Planners will be methodical in their use of time. They will make lists, draw charts and use coloured pens to track their progress. They embrace routine, and know that a little goes a long way. They are the organisation equivalent of Doctor Who's Weeping Angels, slowly creeping forward knowing that they will eventually snog their victim to death. Is that what the Weeping Angels did? I can't remember.Crammers will leave things until the last minute. A deadline is an abstract concept to be ignored, like death or mortgages or Pokemon. They will wait until the white heat of a deadline is burning their eyeballs before starting a project. And that's when they will do their best work. Like Superman only saving things at the last minute because he suddenly remembers he could rotate the Earth in a backwards direction and therefore reverse time, a chunk of scientific bunkum that would have left Isaac Newton literally spinning in his grave. I realise this sounds awfully binary. Planners and crammers. Opposite sides of a coin, like odd socks versus matching socks, toilet roll positioning, Tennant stans versus Smith stans, or techno heads arguing over their favourite Orbital brother.The truth is, life is not binary. Real lift is nuanced, with gradations of grey, or 'greydations' for short. True joy is found in the inbetween places, in neither one extreme nor the other. How else can you explain the beauty of twilight, the thrill of salted caramel, or your third child who is neither the prettiest not the brightest but, y'know, they're a good kid.But if we are to buy into the pseudo-psychological device of identifying people as planners or crammers then I am most definitely a crammer. I need deadlines to add spark to my creativity. It's why this blog post exists: I promised that I wouldn't go a month without blogging, and look, here we are, on the last day of the month squeezing out a blog turd before the month is flushed away.A while ago, I posted about a rather large medical crisis. I am doing well, and my medical stats are good. Last week. my GP rang me to tell me how well I was doing, and how handsome I was, and how if I was to ride a horse, I would ride it brilliantly. Something like that anyway; I wasn't really listening. But yes, I am surviving well. Thriving, even.This does mean that next month, I am going to step up my creative projects. I am back to full-time at the Burgess Foundation, and I have continued to pen my column for Electronic Sound magazine. In a few weeks, I will step up my commitments by increasing my writing work.This does mean I'm going to have to learn to plan*. Now that I'm using assistive technology for read and write, and now that I am susceptible to the kind of fatigue that is probably common for people whose brains have exploded, I'm going to have to get organised. Writing diaries, wordcount deadlines, not starting my end-of-year album countdown a few days before the end of the year. Planning, not cramming.There are three, not two, ways of approaching deadlines. There's planning. There's cramming. And there's planning the cramming, a whole new third nexus of human operation that will (a) blow a hole in all of our existing realities and (b) maybe guarantee that I produce more than one blog post a month.* \"I'm going to have to learn to plan\" makes me sound super amateurish, as if I'm careening from one calamity to another. I'm actually an excellent planner. I remember to empty my bin before the bin lorry comes and everything."},

Twitter is now a waste ground, a pile of collapsed scaffolding populated by only bird crap and rats. It's not even called Twitter anymore. It's called Eggs or something. Absolute rubbish.Which is a shame. I quite liked the synergy between my Twitter feed and this blog. Twitter definitely fed this blog. And sometimes I would fart out a tweet with very little forethought, and that would inspire a blog post.Facebook isn't in great shape either. Recently I read every single post on Facebook that had ever been published in the history of humankind, and 98% of them were a picture of a cassette tape and a pencil, next to the words \"like this picture if you know what the link is\". I'm old enough to remember cassette tapes. We didn't use pencils to wind them. We use tape players. They had fast forward buttons. AND a rewind button. Pencils?! Jeez.And then there's Instagram and Threads and Blue Balls and Mastubate and honestly I can't keep up with the modem world. In my day, the only way you could publish something was to cave ten commandments into a stone tablet then hike up a mountain until you were smited by God.Good job Blogger is still massively trendy. All the kids are on Blogger. Skateboards, handstands, tank tops, blogs. These are all the cool things that cool kids keep cool to.Crikes. What a waste of a blog post. This is worse than Twitter. I could have written something interesting, such as the fact that the top seven positions in the current UK singles chart are occupied by women, or how to get Pot Noodle stains out of a vicar's underwear. But no. More semi-translucent thoughts vomited into a cavern of nothing.I shall end this blog post with a list of my five favourite tweets, although they're not real tweets because I just made them up right here right now.1. Aaaaargh.2. Aaaaaaaaaargh.3. Seriously, is someone going to help me, I'm up to my neck in frogs.4. Aaaaargh. Why are you typing? Stop typing. The frogs!5. Oh hi. A frog here. Ignore the screaming.

{"title": "Belief to the Max: What my brain enjoyed at BlueDot 2023", "date": "Aug 20, 2023", "text": "I never thought I would make it to BlueDot Festival. As mentioned in a previous blog post, my brain exploded and I've been quite poorly.But made it, I did. It was a real achievement, like Neil Armstrong walking on the moon, or even more impressively, the moon walking all over Neil Armstrong. One small step for a pre-stroke Roland, but a giant leap considering my recent circumstances. BlueDot is an annual festival dedicated to music and science. The music often has an electronic music bent, which is my favourite kind of bent. And the science side of the programming is especially relevant because the festival takes place at the Jodrell Bank observatory, its giant outer space magic dish looming wherever you go.Honestly, that dish is so dang cool, firing its radio waves with abandon at the furthest reaches of space. The dish constantly moves throughout the weekend, and during headline performances it becomes the trendiest projection screen this side of Venus. The dish is especially exciting for Doctor Who fans, of which there are many at BlueDot. Firstly, a TV prop version of the telescope killed off the Tom Baker Doctor Who. And secondly, the dish often moves position when you're not looking, like those scary statues in Blink.So let's go through some favourite acts from the weekend.Pop powerhouse Georgia plays all of the instruments all of the time. Joyous sunshine on a cloudy day. Her father Leftfield also played the festival, Neil Barnes' perfect sound design making him a contender for the loudest act of the weekend, perhaps tying in the decibel destruction stakes with the raucous Snapped Ankles.We danced like crazy to Acid Klaus, a wonderfully hedonistic party band led by Adrian Flanagan from the International Teachers Of Pop. Onipa was my surprise of the weekend. They gave us a relentless Afrobeat explosion led by human Duracell bunny KOG. Irresistible  Ghanaian rhythms colliding enthusiastically with UK electronica. And the bawdy electrostomp of MADMADMAD brought on the cowbell apocalypse while, later in the gig, channeling the ferocity of very early Chemical Brothers.There was so much more, including Grace Jones and TVAM and Creep Show, but let's end things with my top two bestest fave acts of the weekend. Belief were in many ways on of the simplest acts in the line-up. Two guys, a bunch of gear, not much else. But when it's acid house of such housey acidity, I'm not complaining. Oh, it was so good. And all hail Max Cooper, whose audiovisual extravaganza I'd failed to catch on two previous occasions. He. Was. Stunning. One of the best gigs I've been to, with super duper techno gorgeousness soundtracking colossal juxtaposing visuals. I mean, really colossal. Front rail, eyes the size of jellyfish, brain flung into the cosmos.There's much I missed, including most of Grace Jones because I was busy maxxing out to Max Cooper. The endless deluge of mud curtailed much of my casual browsing, so I missed Adam Buxton and Toby Hadoke and Pavement. The one talk I did catch was the brilliant Matthew Cobb talking about all the horrible diseases that are going to destroy humankind. Maybe not the best talk to attend when you're up to your neck in mud, but hey ho.A special shout-out to Nina, Nick, Dave, my surprise neighbour Angela from Nine Arches Press, my glamping tent which lessened the worst effects of the mid, the topless drunk dancer who fed me pizza, and the horrible person who did a big Mr Whippy poo in the showers.Roll on 2024."},

I started this blog when I was 31. And now here I am, on a diet of coal dust and zimmer frames. I remember when this was all fields.I'm super grateful to reach this landmark. It is, of course, completely arbitrary. I might as well measure my life in shapes or whisks or Aphex Twin Soundcloud tracks. Still. It's a sense of achievement, like getting your steps in or putting the bins out.My original plans for this landmark birthday were grand. Go clubbing. Ride on a pleasure cruise. Launch a rocket and punch Jupiter in the face. But I scaled down my ambitions. I've had to make do with drinks with friends, which has been a whole bucket of lovely. Friends are great, aren't they.Can I derive any special meaning from having my 50th today? Probably not. Barbie Girl by Aqua is currently number 50 in the singles chart, an unwelcome revival prompted by the (very good) Barbie movie. At number 50 in the current albums chart is Legend, the greatest hits compilation by Bob Marley and the Wailers. This all seems suitably old school for an old guy.How about the number 50 in terms of Warp Records catalogue numbers? WAP50 is the woozy space jam Wilmot by Sabres of Paradise. That'll do nicely. The track is drunken and lazy and atmospheric and giddy, and I shall wish for no better a metaphor.Orbital's fiftieth album track, if you line up their studio albums on Discogs then do a rough count that might be wrong, is the Ian Drury-sampling bovver boy techno stomp Oi! Maybe that should set my attitude for the next ten years. Lots of stomping. Shouting \"hit me!\" a lot. Kick up a bit of trouble.Earlier this year, Fifty Fifty became the first female K-pop band to score a top ten single in the UK. Cupid is a sickly-sweet slice of Spice Girls-lite pop that, I think, I've heard knocking about TikTok somewhere. I like this much less than the Orbital and Sabres thing. Forget I ever mentioned this.I feel optimistic about my fifties. Partly because I came through a lot to get here, and I'm grateful for being on planet Earth. And also partly because I have an empty brain and I am easily amused, like a puppy or a jellyfish or Ken from the Barbie film.Enough waffle about being 50. I've got a pub to go to. I'm going to have 50 pints and them I'm going to have 50 cakes and then I'm going to go to 50 more pubs, because I will double down on this 50 theme until I'm 50 feet under.Further Fats: Because / a melon / only slightly: birthday thoughts (2012)Further Fats: Five starring roles in the video for Aphex Twin's On (2018)"},
{"title": "1990s techno just trended on TikTok", "date": "Jul 17, 2023", "text": "Latest news from TikTok land. A user has posted about a misprinted vinyl edition of Taylor Swift's Speak Now (Taylor's Version). Instead of the dulcet tones of Pennsylvania's favourite country music escapee, it played the album Happy Land: A Compendium Of Electronic Music From The British Isles 1992-1996 Vol. 1. Quite the surprise.I have to admit something. I know nothing about Taylor Swift's music. I have a good working knowledge of a lot of pop acts – Girls Aloud, Lil Nas X, Pet Shop Boys, Years & Years, Kylie Minogue, Crazy Frog. But Taylor's music leaves me cold, with her being my least preferred speed-themed music star after Rush, Fast Food Rockers and Hurry Styles. (Sorry.) TikTokker Rachel Hunter was the victim of an anomaly, like buying a packet of porridge and accidentally getting a vortex to an alternative universe in which glow sticks and tie-dyed t-shirts are the norm. She accidentally found herself listening to:Xeper's Carceres Ex Novum, produced by the bloke from The Black Dog and featured on the first Trance Europe Express album.Soul Vine (70 Billion People) which found Cabaret Voltaire embracing 90s techno while sampling TV show The Outer Limits.Thunderhead's 11-minute acid ambient dub monster True Romance. This also appeared on Holistic Recordings' Paul Smith EP, which I don't think has anything to do with the similarly named lead singer of Maxïmo Park.And more. There's Matthew Herbert, Aphex Twin, and Happy Land by Ultramarine starring the melty vocals of Robert Wyatt.The original TikTok video is great. She focusses on a sinister Cabaret Voltaire sample. \"There's 70 billion people on earth, where are they hiding,\" says the voice. Fair point. My local Spar is always dead so they're definitely not in there. Where are they? Inside the freezer cabinet? Hiding under the frozen peas? Good question, CabVol.I once bought an album called Anthology by the 1990s techno act Pentatonik (listen to Green here). A lovely vinyl edition bought from an underground independent Manchester record shop, the name of which escapes me. I was gutted to find two sides were identical: clearly a misprint. I never got it replaced. I've still got it somewhere – it's probably worth, oooh, at least £5.24 now.Big up to Above Board Distribution, who I hope will sell loads more copies of their British electronica compilation. I didn't expect 1990s techno to be trending on TikTok. That's like a penny farthing competing the Tour de France.

{"title": "Braindance: an update", "date": "Jun 30, 2023", "text": "Hello there, reader. My name is Fat Roland. You might remember me from the blog post that leaked an Autechre album that turned out not to be an Autechre (pictured) album, or that blog post about Guru Josh that got a slightly snarky response from Guru Josh's PR people.It's nearly two months since I posted about \"my personal braindance\", a euphemistic name I gave to a stroke that I suffered ten weeks ago. I wrote about my hallucinations, my loss of eyesight and the smattering of internet projects that had to come to an end. Go here to read that blog post.It has been a while, so I guess we're all due for an update.There is good news and bad news. Actually, no. There is only really good news. I am doing well. The hallucinations have calmed down, I'm getting better every week, and I've even lost two and a half stone in weight because I'm being a good boy and eating all of my vegetables. I suffer from dizziness and fatigue, but nothing that I can't handle, and even this is improving week by week.My vision has improved. In that original blog post, I talked about hallucinations of an inter-dimensional bicycle and a dog-walking shrub. Since then, I've had no significant visual disruption aside from small glitches. My knackered brain has clearly figured out how my eyes work. Well done, brain. I'm still using visual aids to read text, but I don't need it all of the time, although I get less worn out if I let the technology do the work.Another thing that happened to me two months ago, and I didn't mention this originally, is that I was diagnosed with diabetes. Type two, which is twice as cool as type one because that's how numbers work. The undiagnosed diabetes didn't cause the stroke, and the stroke didn't cause the diabetes. They both developed because of my crap lifestyle and being a lardy old sausage.The medical system is looking after me. I've been to a diabetes support group, I've had personal phone calls from my GP, and on Monday someone's going to put knives in my eyes to see if my brain has fallen out (or something, I didn't read the letter properly). When you have two major conditions, you suddenly get shoved to the front of medical queues. It's like being a celebrity, but almost dead instead of famous.So yes, things are going well. Hurrah. Worst and best moments, aside from (worst) the stroke and (best) surviving the stroke?The best moment was when my mates delivered a Cameo message from IndyCar racing driver Romain Grosjean, who had famously risen like a phoenix from the flames in a terrible crash at the 2020 Bahrain formula one grand prix. Romain said some very sweet things which made me cry for joy. I'll post the video one day, if you're allowed to post these type of things.The worst moment was in the hospital, just a few days after the stroke. The entire ward had just one pillow. One. In the bed next to me was a septuagenarian with a broken hip, so he got the solitary head support. Poor guy. I used my own clothes as a pillow, which is a bit awkward when you only have the one set of clothes and none of the pyjamas fit you. Humiliating. The NHS needs more than claps and rainbow flags. I'm doing well. Resting lots, working more, eating boring things, getting stronger. I'm still writing my column for Electronic Sound magazine, and I've still got a hand on the tiller at the Burgess Foundation. Both have been tremendously supportive.And I might write more blog posts soon.

Second time in a year. They were on great form, all angular and melodic and alien. The visuals by Emma Catnip were a treat.But the dancefloor was a strange experience. I was right at the front but floating in a void, unaware of those around me. I’d walked into a bin on the way to the gig, and when buying headache tablets from Spar, the packet read like hieroglyphics. I’d have hung around in town, but my head was exploding. And I mean that more literally than you might think.After scans and prods and hospital trolleys, I now know the truth of what happened. I might be the first person boogying at the front of a Plaid gig having suffered a stroke earlier in the same day. I wouldn’t be diagnosed for another three days after the concert, with eye drops and brain diagrams and that Kubrickian body tube that goes bang a lot. I was disorientated because part of my visual cortex had fried, rendering me partially sighted.The clues were there in the intervening days between my disorientating gig and my hospital stay. On my walk to my GP with what I assumed at that point to be a minor eye problem, two odd things happened. I saw a pensioner walking towards me on a leafy lane. He was on his own. Narrow pavement, casual amble, a rickety wall on one side and a rickety cottage on the other. When I glanced at him a second time, he was accompanied by a wife who definitely wasn’t there before. Shortly afterwards, a postman riding a bicycle folded out of sight then reappeared. It happened before my eyes, as real as the words are on this page. I don’t know much about modern employment conditions within the postal service, but I don’t think dimensional teleportation is part of the contract.The stroke has destroyed half of my eyesight. In true surrealist Fat Roland style, the missing halves are the right section of each eye. Because eyes dart about and the brain is clever, I don’t have black spots. I can see everything. But if my brain hasn’t received full information about a section of what I’m looking at, it makes things up. This causes hallucinations. I have looked into the twilight sky and seen a hospital floating mid-air, in full detail. I have seen imaginary crows flapping around the edges of my vision. I have seen a cheerful dog on a lead being walked by a bush because my brain couldn’t register the difference between a dog owner and shrubbery. A quick dart of the eyes, and my visual register filled in the correct information. I think my brain is having far too much fun with this.This also means I am learning to read again. I’ve lost the ability to laterally scan text, which is pretty essential for a horizontal writing system. I have lost definition, and may never read a paper book again. That said, I have already seen improvements. I am writing this in Word without the use of a screen reader, which I couldn’t have done a week ago. However, I’m choosing to use assistive tech because reading things – including reading back over these sentences – is a strain. Might as well use tech to preserve stamina. It was worse in the first few days after my stroke. In hospital, all signs were confusing. Words had lost their  visual symmetry entirely, and all d’s and b’s and p’s looked the same. I now have my symmetry back as my brain tries ever so hard to cope with my condition.The damage is permanent. The fried part of my brain will never be unfried. But I’m confident about recovery as I begin what feels like Life Part Two. I will be slowly integrating back into my role at the brilliant Burgess Foundation. My work with Electronic Sound will continue, although for now will be restrained to a slightly shorter column. I’m sure I will cartoon again, although I may need to learn new techniques. I will likely have to give up running my F1 Losers League because there’s too much detailed spreadsheet and website work. And because casual social media browsing is no longer viable, I am retiring the @AngryBeetham Twitter account which I have been secretly running for ten years.Best of all, this blog will continue. With my visual input reduced, the world of music is so much more important. Expect a 10,000 word review of the MRI scanner: its endless claustrophobic bangs at my heavily constrained body was some of the best techno I have ever heard. This stroke could be the most techno thing that has ever happened.Featured video: Plaid’s Return to Return, aka This Is What My Brain Looks Like NowFor my followers, a little update and a big thank you.

{"title": "It's a Miracle: The race for Easter number one", "date": "Apr 9, 2023", "text": "Can we talk about the extraordinary run of Easter number one singles we had in the second half of the 1990s? Yes, I know Easter is no Christmas, but bear with me.By the mid-1990s, Take That had locked out the Easter number one spot. Yawn. Everything Changes? Easter Sunday number one. Back For Good? Easter Sunday number one. The Manchester popsters had become the second coming of Jesus. This was all about to change.On Easter Sunday 1996, the Prodigy scored their first number one single with Firestarter. A devil-horned Keith Flint would contort and grimace at the camera and the Easter bunny would be writing a letter of complaint to its local vicar.The following Easter, 1997, the Chemical Brothers would follow up their Noel Gallagher collab Setting Sun with the brilliant Block Rockin' Beats. Easter number one. Its b-side was Morning Lemon, which sounds like something you’d definitely eat at Easter.The following year’s Easter number one was It’s Like That, Run DMC’s remix with LA producer Jason Nevins. The track kept Celine Dion off the number one spot for three full weeks, which is pretty much the equivalent of dying for our sins.Already, we’re in uncharted territory. Cool hits had topped the charts sporadically at Easter – Let’s Dance in 1983, Pet Shop Boys’ Heart in 1988 – but never three years in a row. We’re truly in the middle of an Easter miracle.In 1999, a puppet as yellow as an Easter chick topped the Easter chart. The underrated Mr Oizo scored his only hit single with Flat Beat. The sausage-chomping muppet Flat Eric (yes, it’s a muppet) denied Eminem a number one spot with his debut single.Easter number one in 2000 was Fragma’s Toca's Miracle, and while this clever mashup wasn’t quite as critically acclaimed, it concluded a remarkable five years of electronic music Easter chart toppers. The following year? Emma Bunton or something. Rubbish.2023's Easter number one is, as it happens, a song called Miracle. This trance collaboration between Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding is a real throw-back to the classic era of dancey Easter number one singles. Electronic music has risen again. It’s what Jesus would have wanted..embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }"},

{"title": "Ten album titles that are puns - the good, the bad and the willie", "date": "Feb 28, 2023", "text": "Recently, Drowned in Sound's Twitter account posed the question: Has there ever been a good song or album title containing a pun?Let's find some kind of answer. Here are ten albums with punny titles along with my thoughts on each and every dang one of them. The Orb: Orblivion Plays into the ever-pulsating galactic dramatics of The Orb. Certainty works better than \"Armageddorb\" or \"Catastrorbphe\". Undermined by their other album UF Orb which sounds like a pun but really doesn't work. In fact, it's terrible.Sleaford Mods: UK GrimNottingham’s mouthiest geezers have been knocking about for yonks, but it’s only until now that they’ve concocted the perfect album title. This play on ‘UK grime’ speaks to the core of the band: rap music, British vibes, everything being crap. This is excellent pun work from the guys that gave us Tied Up In Nottz and Eton Alive.Blink-182: Enema of the State Just thinking about this album title makes me empty my bowels. Which is exactly what the California rock imps wanted. Even the cover is awful, with its sexy gloved nurse. A childish embarrassment to puns everywhere. Jeez, guys, what’s your age again?Salt-N-Pepa: A Salt with a Deadly PepaFor a band with a wordplayed DJ in the form of Spinderella, you'd think everyone's fave condiment-themed rappers would nail a pun. Not so. The album title starts well, but like the album it runs out of ideas. \"Pepa\" is standing in for the word \"weapon\". Unless you're talking about pepper spray, this doesn't cut the mustard gas. Poor. The Shirehorses: Our Kid EhAs suggested by Thomas Ragdale on Twitter. It feels like puns come with the territory with Mark & Lard's parody project, and indeed the first track on the album is If You Tolerate This Piss by the Manic Street Sweepers. What raises this above the average pun is the delightful audacity of knocking off Kid A only a mere seven months after that seminal album's release. Talk about poking sacred cows with a stick. Impressive.Rednex: Sex & ViolinsSparks: Gratuitous Sax & Senseless ViolinsNo.David Bowie: Aladdin SaneBowie really didn’t have many options after Ziggy Stardust. He’d been to Mars, he’d invented the bisexual alter-ego as icon, he’d made a synthesiser sound like a saxophone. A-Lad-Insane is a pretty solid pun which carries all the weight of the craziness of stardom. It's a bit naff but, whisper it, Bowie often was. (Complaint letters to the usual address.)Will Smith: Willennium Big Willie Style is perhaps a more famous album for this freshest of princes, which is unfortunate because in UK slang this is definitely not the kind of pun you need. Willennium is Will Smith’s wild wild western era, and it feels like there were greater puns to be found here rather than this millennial mediocrity. The Good, the Bad and the Willie, maybe.Bola: SoupBola: FyutiBola: GnayseBola: KroungrineBola: DEGI had to include Manchester’s downtempo maestro in this listing. The albums listed here are puns on a bowl of soup, a footballer, bolognese, crown green bowler, and boiled egg. This should be awful, but Bola somehow managed all this while maintaining his creative integrity. Quite frankly, I’m Bola-d over.Phats & Small: Now Phats What I Small MusicSometimes you don’t know whether something is absolute genius or the worst thing ever invented, like Marmite or crocs or the jelly toaster. I may have made that last one up. The jury is still out on the title of Phats & Small’s debut album. Considering the album is only ten tracks long and Turn Around features twice, let’s not lose any sleep over it.Punning album titles are still all the rage, as evidenced by the title of Orbital's brand new album Optical Delusion. Which punning album titles impress you? Which make you feel all Blink 182ed? Let me know on Twitter."},
{"title": "My magical dream: everything's gone all Chris de Burgh", "date": "Jan 16, 2023", "text": "There's an old 808 song about a magical dream that goes:It's a fantasy taking over your mind So let it roll, let it roll with easeIt will take control of the rest of your soulAnd explode... into a magical dreamThe song about a magical dream carries on talking about the magical dream and how having a magical dream is great because it's magical and a dream. Can't remember the name of the track.Which brings me to the subject of this blog post. Dreams. More specifically, a dream I had. People waffling about dreams can be pretty dull in the scheme of things, so feel free to scroll off to some more fascinating corner of the internet.Last night, I dreamed I used a 3D printing vending machine for dresses. A what now? A unit where you pressed a load of buttons and it would spit out a dress. For a women. A proper figure-hugging dress like you see at awards ceremonies.After scrolling through some templates on the vending machine touchscreen, I decided to get one. The quality of the material looked good. You could choose the strap design and the neckline and any little extras. Lovely.I chose a red dress. Really red, like Mr Strong driving a fire engine then blushing about it. Soooo red. As Chris de Burgh sang:The lady in redIs dancing with meBum cheek to bum cheekAt least, I think that's how the song went. Looking at the preview screen, the colour was a bit too blocky, so decided to personalise it with a text pattern. Lots of small white type all over the dress, with the words \"Fat Roland\" over and over again. FAT ROLAND FAT ROLAND FAT ROLAND.The machine couldn't handle things, and the text rendered badly. Overlaps, warps, random lines criss-crossing. But then I angled the text at 45 degrees and it was kind of fine. That'll do. If people wanted to read FAT ROLAND, they'll just have to look at it wonky.At the bottom of the vending machine menu was a big PURCHASE button, alongside the final price including customisations. It would cost £450. Shocked at how expensive this was, I brought my friends in to discuss the wisdom of the purchase. We had a long conversation acknowledging the substandard quality of the final product, even though it was still a preview on a screen rather than the end print. We discussed my financial situation and whether I could afford to take the hit. We also needed to balance that with a need to serve my monstrous narcissism. I also asked if this is how much dresses cost in Primark because, as you can tell from all this, I don't buy dresses.And then I fell into a deeper sleep. Drifted from REM into heavy unconsciousness, any dream sequences fading into darkness. Do we still dream when we're properly conked out? Probably not. My drapery frippery was long lost.When I finally started waking up, a couple of minutes before my alarm, the dream briefly returned. The discussion with my friends was just finishing. Had they really stuck around all this time? I had opted to not buy the dress because that was the pragmatic and grown-up thing to do. The sense of making a decision made me feel assured as I started my day back in the real world.Which is why I'm writing this blog post in my usual rags, and not crammed into a red dress looking like Elmo with haemorrhoids."},
{"title": "An interview with Black Box and why Ride On Time was not of its time", "date": "Jan 10, 2023", "text": "Here's a Fat Roland flashback (a Flat Rolashback?) to an interview I conducted in 2019. I spoke to Black Box's Daniele Davoli about the band's massive 1989 hit Ride On Time. Labels said the vocals were “very aggressive” and it barely shifted a copy of its first pressing. \"It completely cleared the floor,\" he told me when the tune hit the clubs \"It was heartbreaking.\"So how did it become such a big hit single? Read on for a preview. You can read the full piece over at Electronic Sound.In a dusty room above a garage in northern Italy, a musician brandishes a vacuum cleaner. Scattered along the walls is a guitar, some old keyboards, a half-broken mixer, and a speaker with a wonky tweeter. Outside, a bell tower shatters the silence and next door’s dogs yap in response. In this damp, distracting space in Reggio Emilia, Daniele Davoli is trying to rewrite house music history.“The bell tower was ding dong, ding dang dong,” recalls Davoli, “and the neighbour’s dogs were woof woof woof. If we were recording vocals, we had to stop. There was no insulation, it was just a bedroom without the bed.”This story ends well. Davoli will go on to form Black Box, whose Ride On Time, released in July 1989, popularised choppy Italo house piano lines. But we’re not quite there yet. As the group formed, sample culture had become the socks-and-sandals of dance music: a shortcut for naff. Where Paul Hardcastle once stood, now there was Harry “Loadsamoney” Enfield parodying Pump Up The Volume. Ride On Time was against trend – and its journey to success had more stumbles than the Stutter Rap.Davoli was DJ Lelewel, banging out soul and disco hits at Rimini’s Starlight club...

I love that tartan eyeliner, and those designer galoshes really compliment your knee pads.It's 2023, and if the progression of previous years is anything to go by, we'll be swallowed by burning lava or eaten by locusts within weeks. Still, there's lots of music to enjoy, and I am going to bang on about some of that music now.All these January 2023 releases are proper bang-on.The Black Dog: Music For Dead Airports (Dust Science, EP, pictured above)These four tracks are atmospheric spatial electronics, at least in part recorded in Sheffield airports. The work is inspired by Sheffield's troubled history with airports, including the doomed Sheffield City Airport which had a runway too short for popular budget airlines. Also Sheffield's really hilly and planes hate hills. Music For Dead Airports is released alongside the band's 2010 field recordings album Music for Real Airports.Music For Dead Airports by The Black DogRian Treanor & Ocen James: Saccades (Nyege Nyege Tapes)A remarkable listen, this. Arising from a residency in Kampala, Rotheram's Rian Treanor produces folk techno with Acholi fiddle player Ocen James. Think super rhythmic Ugandan techno using real instruments. This follows 2020's Treanor album File Under UK Metaplasm, which I described previously as \"a rave in the middle of Mike Teavee's fractal transfer in Charlie And The Chocolate Factory\".Saccades by Rian Treanor & Ocen JamesOceanic: Choral Feeling (Nous'klaer Audio)We've had an artist from Rotherham. Now let's have one from Rotterdam. For this debut album, Oceanic asked his friends to sing for him. Simple. The resulting vocal melee is mesmerising, with the rhythmic vocals sounding fully human yet so alien. The repetitive and blossoming Sunshine, Dear is a banger. Oceanic is not to be confused with the early-1990s rave act signed to Cheshire's Dead Dead Good Records.Choral Feeling by OceanicRyuichi Sakamoto: 12 (Milan Records)No Bandcamp preview for this one. This is a selection of musical sketches to mark the revered composer's 71st birthday. He's approached it as a kind of diary, and it tracks a long battle with cancer in which he found himself \"reaching for the synthesiser\". The track titles are all numbers, and look like a Sudoku grid has glitched because Elon Musk sacked all the puzzle setters. There's a super minimal album teaser on YouTube, although it doesn't give much away. I'll bang on more about this album in Electronic Sound.Eat Static: Abduction (Planet Dog) And finally, look out for this reissue of a 1993 ambient trance classic by the Ozric Tentacles offshoot. It's on double vinyl and comes with added John Peel session tracks. Psychedelic trance that is very druggy, very snappy, and very Planet Doggy."},

How can all the rich complexities of music fandom be contained in a list? My rundown is always far too blokey, and my fickle tastes spin like a weathercock in a washing machine. That said…Phwoar. I bloomin’ love Lad Ash. A brilliant album at the top of a brilliant countdown! No matter how hard I yanked my tombola handle to shuffle my options for favourite album of the year, time after time these London lads’ second album kept popping out. It’s an impressive musical summary of this entire countdown in a way: the light-footed beats of Bonobo, the accessible melodies of Moderat, the laddishness of Working Men’s Club, the electronic emotion of μ-Ziq. It spins through a rolodex of dance music influences, from 90s house to two-step to ambience and generally excellent boogie music.The bedtime-muttered vocals are oh-so yearning. “I wish I could do better, burn money like the KLF.” “I'm trying to come of age, can we change the subject?” “I felt like I was part of something.” Aside from the personal narration that sounds like Mike Skinner’s moody brother, the almost-choral use of vocals is a delight, thanks in no small part to vocalist Zoee.The sultry attitude isn't enough, though, and it needs instrumentation to back it up. Oh boy. We get hissing synths on Dream On, urgent snares on Dolphin Junction, widescreen ambience extending the trippy vocals on Since I, a washed-out Born Slippy stomp on Your Guiding Hand. So. Many. Tunes.Following their 2015 debut ‘Real Life’, the band talked about Lad Ash’s songs being a “farewell to something”. They had scrapped an earlier version of this second album and were newly pared down to a duo, so it was indeed borne of creative loss.But the loss they evoke here is deeper. There's talk of “wide-eyed teenhood” and “suburban dust”, the sound of two guys hurtling through life and trying, helplessly, to grasp onto the past. Maybe that’s why I connected so hard. I started this blog in my early 30s, and next year I’ll be 50. I’m not the same person I was, and every so often I have to correct my vision of myself. Lad Ash nails that spinning carousel of life in its lyrics and in its rose-tinted/tainted musical glasses. As it says on An Oral History Of My First Kiss:“There's an awkward gap between childhood and being properly teenage. A peripheral shadowland of not quite being enough.”Same for us middle-agers. Nothing’s never quite enough. I never achieve enough. I never blog enough. This countdown is not enough. You've not read enough words on this page: I'm pretty sure you skipped a couple earlier on.But, and this is the important bit, this is all we have. It will do, and we'll be happy with it. Congratulations, Real Lies, you are my favourite electronic music album of 2022.Curious track: The breezy breakbeat on Dream On feels like something you could actually ride, like a car made of audio or something. Seriously. A journalist for 31 years and I come up with this.Album feels: Wanting to be young again, but definitely not wanting to be young again.Cover art: Statue snogging. Absolutely disgusting.A final word: Firstly, an honourable mention for Ceephax Acid Crew, who released an album on Christmas Day, which is far too late to be absorbed for this countdown. Also, apologies to the 92 million album producers I forgot to include. Secondly, thanks to everyone for reading my blog in 2022. I warn you now: 2023 is going to be IMMENSE. From another website: On Lad Ash, Real Lies are alchemists – making music that is in equal part for the head, the heart and the gut. (Narc.)Lad Ash by Real LiesThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here.This is the penultimate album in my 2022 countdown. This brings to an end my Top 10 countdown, indeed my countdown of 75+ albums, bar one important final blog post – the number one electronic music album of 2022. So nearly there.See the full countdown here.μ-Ziq: Hello (Planet Mu)There’s a lot to unpack here. There was an EP called Goodbye and now an album called Hello, and there was three-part magical pony prancing, and indeed his other 2022 album Magic Pony Ride (Planet Mu) should be considered as part two of this top ten inclusion. Pardon? You might want to read that again. It seems reworking his classic 1997 album Lunatic Harness triggered in Mike Paradinas a period of fertility worthy of post-brain tumour Anthony Burgess or post-brain frying Jack Torrance. Hello is melodic beyond words. There’s waveform-wobbling choirs, moth-bitten acid, junglist breaks suspended in pea soup gloom. It's like raving to drill and bass but the drills are blancmange and the bass is even more blancmange. Paradinas being Paradinas at his most Paradinas. Absolutely wonderful.Curious track: Magic Pony Ride (Pt​.​3) is a deliriously happy conclusion to his various Pony Rides.Album feels: Like a fairground with more candy floss stands than it necessarily needs but no-one's complaining.Cover art: A conceptual evocation of early Warp Records vinyl artwork. From another website: Загадочный IDM/DnB-эмбиент от радующего нас уже тридцать лет британского ветерана электронной сцены. Вполне мог бы быть саундтреком к восьмибитной компьютерной игре в жанре фэнтези. (AOTY)Hello by µ-ZiqThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here.We're almost there. The countdown is nearly complete. Over 70 albums later, and we have a final two Top 10-ers then... drum roll.. the album of the year. You could cut the tension with a sausage. Next up is a band I saw recently at the White Hotel and they were flipping brilliant.See the full countdown here.Plaid: Feorm Falorx (Warp)When I declared Plaid’s previous album Polymer as the best album of 2019, I wrote: “This is a Plaid album that feels angry”, pointing out their descent “into a valley of darkness”. I still think that’s their magnum opus, their chef-d'oeuvre. Feorm Falorx is quite the mood change, shining a light into the shadows. The concept is that we’re enjoying a Plaid gig at the Feorm festival on the planet of Falorx. Bear with me, now. The festival is infinite and Plaid are made of light beams. Before you dismiss this as fanciful nonsense, I’ve actually been there. It’s a lovely planet with: attractive hedgerows; thrumming baroque melodies; fluffy headnod rhythms; Plaid’s trademark seductive spiralling melodies multiplied by a thousand; a fully functioning network of motorways and b-roads; epic highs soaked with anxious ambience; characterful guitar work from Mason Bee; and a splendid visitor’s centre gift shop. Even better with the beautifully designed accompanying graphic novel by Emma Catnip.Curious track: The pairing of C.A. and Cwtchr is one of the bestest ever Plaid moments.Album feels: Light beams. Aliens. Basically like visiting Mars with your phone light on.Cover art: That bit in Arrival where they're talking to aliens inside the floaty baked bean. From another website: If there’s anything to find comfort in these days, then it’s the fact that Plaid are still around, ready to provide another door to escape through – at least for a fleeting moment.

You might remember me from Fat Roland's favourite albums of 2022. Let's chug on.See the full countdown here.O'Flynn and Frazer Ray: Shimmer (Technicolour)I’m live-blogging this 2022 album countdown, so I don’t have an awful lot of time for research. I know that Frazer Ray is also known as Soundbwoy Killah and produces a neat line in bass-burning breaks. I know that O'Flynn was responsible for Otomo, the Bulgarian choir-sampling highlight of Bonobo’s latest album. And I know they’ve produced a killer collaborative album in the shape of Shimmer. In a wild ride from start to finish, it funnels rave culture into fractals of Burial, Joy Orbison and UK bass. The two were inseparable in the making of this album, with Frazer sleeping on O’Flynn’s floor, and O’Flynn adding richly to Frazer’s minimal production set-up. The result is super tight, stretching deep into urban-inflected bass explorations and high into peaks of euphoric techno. A superb work. Worth knowing.Curious track: Call For Noise, which feels like Bicep with biceps.Album feels: It's like being inside a rave that's made only from the memory of that rave.Cover art: I think someone's spilled some paint. I'll get a mop.Shimmer by O’Flynn x Frazer RayThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here.Insert text here about the ongoing Top 10 blog posts. Note to Fat Roland: don't forget to replace this placeholder text with something more meaningful.See the full countdown here.Max Cooper: Unspoken Words (Mesh)Max Cooper is the first techno act to play the Acropolis in Greece. Don’t say you never learn anything on this website. I don’t know what the Acropolis is. An ice cream parlour or something? The YouTube trailer for Unspoken Words displayed a giddy collage of surrealist images, presumably taken from the film project that accompanied the album. Microscopic organisms skittering, a skull made of flashing landscapes, petals spreading with mathematic precision. It was a decent reflection of the rich tapestry of sounds on the album.Minimalistic synths creep through glitches of percussion, surging into emotive melody. Gleaming cinematic washes rise into heavenly ambience. It’s detailed and engaging, and was so very nearly my album of the year. I’ve looked up acropolis in a dictionary. Apparently, it’s an intense fear of heights. See, youre brain learnin intelliganse things while you read my blog.Curious track: Ascent, which is more Eno than an Eno-shaped Eno at an Eno convention.Album feels: It's like having a massage but it's clouds instead of hands, which you can get these days in modern parlours, I've checked.Cover art: That princess woman's fascinator hat thing. From another website: Repeated listens are a must as you can see where he drops these hints of what’s to come. This is everything, and more, that we have come to expect from Max Cooper. (Clash Music)Unspoken Words by Max CooperThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022.

Presenting the latest of my Top 10 electronic music albums of 2022: a man with six dogs!See the full countdown here.Mall Grab: What I Breathe (Looking For Trouble)Something was bugging me about Mall Grab. A needle in my memory. After days of pondering, the penny dopped. I’d tried to write a review of the Australian producer’s debut album back in the summer, and no-one got back to me with the information I needed. That pinprick of memory was frustration, a feeling in absolute opposition to this brilliantly refreshing album. Low-burning electronic jams, warm flowing chords, bass-heavy armchair techno loops. And in Love Reigns, a sunny piano house stormer worthy of a Confidence Man video of people pratting about in a hot air balloon. Taking influences from a history of house, this album is jolly, populist, festival-friendly and a real palate cleanser in this dense album countdown. Pitchfork hated it, so it must be good. There. I finally published my review.Curious track: I Can Remember It So Vividly steals all of Nintendo's bleeps and turns them into something uber cool.Album feels: An all-you-can-eat buffet, without the bloated feeling afterwards.Cover art: Dog, dog, dog, man, dog, dog, dog. From another website: It's all held together by great pacing, frankly amazing production and a lack of cynicism that feels refreshing, open-hearted to the very last moment. (Resident Advisor)What I Breathe by Mall GrabThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here.Let's have more tantalising Top 10 treats. A reminder that all this is live-blogged, written as first drafts, so don't blame me if handbag I get all my words cheeseboard wrong.See the full countdown here.Lynyn: Lexicon (Sooper)Electronic Sound: “It’s kinetic stuff. His compositional pedigree shows in the ecstatic cymbals and descending strings of the emotional highlight ‘vnar rush’. It’s fully the brain half of braindance.” Talented fella, Lynyn. When he’s not making waves on the Chicago experiment jazz scene or composing for classical bassoon, he’s killing it as a techno producer. In his crunching beats and blurping synths, you can hear Squarepusher and Clark. Pizzicato plucks add drama, spiralling basslines add depth, and his classical nous adds maturity to the whole thing. More classical music folks should become dance music producers. Mozart would have been brilliant at EDM. Probably. I’ve had a listen to his postrock band Monobody. Lynyn’s band, that is, not Mozart’s. You can see how the twists and turns make him a natural techno talent. After all, it’s not a huge jump from bassoon music to bass music.Curious track: Vnar Rush melts into your brain, like spiders giving you a head message then melting into your brain. That's a thing that happens, yes?Album feels: To be honest, I can't quite shift the melting brain spiders metaphor. That.Cover art: Something that looks like a Mini Metro has mated with the Alien alien. From another website: There’s a very futuristic, almost dystopian vibe to Lexicon, something that’s actually reinforced by the odd math-y beats and intricate arrangements. (Sputnik Music)lexicon by lynynThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here.My top 10 countdown of the best electronic music albums of 2022 continues. This isn't opinion, by the way. It's fact. Look up \"Fat Roland's favourite albums\" in the dictionary and you'll get a picture of this blog. Fact. See the full countdown here.Hudson Mohawke: Cry Sugar (Warp)Electronic Sound: “Smooth soul samples chopped and diced, nuclear bass drums, buttery trumpets, carpet bomb sequencing, and, on the strangulated banger ‘Behold’, giddy vocals flattened into a pancake… Utter mayhem in every good way. Expect to hear this everywhere.” Welcome back HudMo, or to give him his full name, Huddleston Morecambe Bay Discount Store. Cry Sugar is daft. The vocal samples are cut using blunt scissors, the bass drums land like a parachuting walrus, the EDM bursts like a glitter bomb. And it’s hugely entertaining. I get the sense that some of the beats are necessary because the soup of samples underneath are barely under control: the machines are having a block party of their life.16 years into his record releasing career, no-one has a right to sound this energised, this frantic, this gloriously epic. You’ve done well, Hudson River Mountaineering Equipment.Curious track: The Timbaland-style Dance Forever that morphs into The Prodigy and then an electric razor.Album feels: Partying on and on until the break of dawn and/or until the sausage rolls run out.Cover art: A marshmallow man getting his booty on. No really. From another website: Just succumb to its unique invention, curious shifts in tone and plethora of weird juxtapositions: something that’s easy enough to do. (The Guardian)Cry Sugar by Hudson MohawkeThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022.

The top 10 continues with a lovely red album. See the full countdown here.Brainwaltzera: ITSAME (FILM)After a slew of EPs, the waltziest braindancer releases a long-awaited second album. With 17 tracks, it’s long, clocking in at 92,000 hours. Probably. I haven’t counted. The project is barely more than five years old, so it’s inevitable that echoes of the past can be heard in his work. Rotten One Note-era Squarepusher. The widescreen analogue vision of Tycho. The classical oomph of Aphex Twin. Heck, the title of the album is a throwback, assuming it’s a reference to Mario.Despite all this, and I’m not sure what voodoo Waltz is working, it feels immediate and fresh. Distant vocal samples fade amid depressive synth fuzz; glitchy beats stumble and yaw; the LFO-woozed ‘evening narcomnastics [DON'T_POST!]’ is more earwormy than any IDM classic. The album also has the most delicate tribute to Formula One safety systems than any other track in this countdown. I could take 92,000 hours and then some.Curious track: Consent has people saying \"yeah\" to acid, which is something I would encourage all kids to do.Album feels: That moment when I get arrested for encouraging children to take acid.Cover art: Red and geometric, like a fire truck or an embarrassed triangle.From another website: There’s so much detail you can practically hear the artist think through each track as the album unfolds... One thing not up for debate: ITSAMASTERPIECE. (Monolith Cocktail)ITSAME by BrainwaltzeraThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here.Hurrah! It's time for my Top 10 album countdown, blog post by blog post until we get to the Bestest Fave Top Mega Best Album of 2022. (I may not actually call it that.) See the full countdown here.Björk: Fossora (One Little Independent)Electronic Sound: “It’s happened. Bjork has finally become a mushroom... the organic matter she’s absorbing is deeply personal. The loss of her mother, but hope for the future. Fagurt Er í Fjörðum features a poem by Latra-Björg, an 18th-century fisherwoman who believed she could cast spells with words. There are millions of species of fungi. Some will poison you, some are indeed magic. Bjork does it all here.”The astonishing thing about Bjork is that no-one could invent her. You could imagine someone coming up with a Coldplay or a Drake. But where do you start with Bjork? She’s fully choral and fully techno and fully alien and fully human. Fossora manages to be completely industrial and ethereal at exactly the same time. She is everything everywhere all at once. With extra clarinets. I’m so glad she invented herself.Curious track: Allow because Bjork keeps saying Allow and I like it when Bjork says Allow.Album feels: It feels like that bit in the Matrix when Keanu's inside that soggy space pod getting sucked off.Cover art: A perfectly normal picture of the Queen of Fungi with a plasma globe hairdo.From another website: Fossora is not her mushroom record, her grief/hope opus, or even her Iceland album as she put it. It’s the sound of Björk building her home as the mother of it all. (Pitchfork)fossora by BjörkThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022.

Think of this as a Top of the Pops countdown but much slower and with fewer numbers. Here comes Todmorden's finest...See the full countdown here.Working Men’s Club: Fear Fear (Heavenly)I’m proud to say that earlier this year, Working Men’s Club hellraising frontman Syd Minsky-Sargeant and I went to an artisan bakery together. You can read all about it in (of course) Electronic Sound. The band impressed with their debut album, and this seething, lava-spitting follow-up doesn’t disappoint.Bright shiny synth lines lead 80s-inflected pop, the machines conjuring memories of Depeche Mode or Japan. And yet it’s all soaked in a dour Yorkshire attitude, despite their proximity to delicious baked goods. The lyrics are as depressed as heck, all death and despair. The best misery lyric? “Why would thy care, thou must just be bluffing.” Mark E Smith, eat your heart out. From another website: The chaotic palette does justice to the devastation and confusion faced in recent years. Working Men’s Club certainly wear the trauma well. (NME)Fear Fear by Working Men's ClubThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022.

You can get my full take on Moderat’s surprise comeback album in episode 55 of the Picky Bastards podcast. That’s right. Words can be audio too. It’s the future!If you can’t be bothered with that, here’s my take on More D4ta, which is an anagram of Moderat 4 because it’s their fourth album. It’s blummin’ lovely. Bulging with nostalgic synths, swelling emotion, melodic whimsy and bits that sound like Radiohead. Apparat really nails the vocals, making us all sad and wistful and teary-eyed. Sigh. Not necessarily a step forward from previous work, but you know what they say: all things in Moderat-ion. And Neon Rats is an absolute spangly banger. Welcome back, Moderat.From another website: the sound of a group creatively recharged and at the height of their power... In almost every conceivable way, it's the Moderat album that fans have waited six years for. (The Line of Best Fit)MORE D4TA by ModeratThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here.This is another album in my list of 20 best electronic albums of 2022. There's loads more - in fact, there's a whole Top 50 plus another 25 commended albums. So many albums, so many words, all live-blogged. Here's an album that sounds a bit like a dinosaur.See the full countdown here.T-Flex: No Comment (DINAMPLATZ)According to the blurb, T-Flex started his career in 2019 all cerebral and brain-thinky. Sounds like hard work. After a contemplative ambient start on this debut album, he’s clearly stuck a pair of dancing shoes to his brain. Flowing electronic beats meet filtered bass bubbles, tight junglist rhythms glide along understated ebbing and flowing chords, squirrelly Squarepusher acid lines waltz drunkenly with skittering Amen breaks.The highlight is Way You Are, a giddy and addictive tribute to 808 rave. This is one of several retro touchpoints, including some significant head-nods towards Metalheadz. Very nearly made my Top 10, and will be many people’s number ones. Made all the better for the presence of Tim Reaper and Datassette remixes.NO COMMENT by T-FlexThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here."},

Wait, sorry, this service is cancelled. You'll have to get on the replacement coach service of bloggery. Here's another instalment in the Top 20. See the full countdown here.Shelley Parker: Wisteria (Hypercolour)I’m never quite sure what wisteria is. A plant? A disease? My neighbour’s pet cockatoo? I feel a sense of uncertainty, which is quite appropriate considering the unease of Parker’s second album. From the threatening gasps that open the album to the tense drum and bass ducking beneath industrial clanging, it’s a troublesome listen. Even when delivering rolling breaks, the album crumbles and sags until its own audio weight. In short, it’s delightful fun. The Royal Horticultural Society website tells me it’s a climbing plant. This album doesn’t just climb. It crawls up from the deep, melting yet rising, pulsing yet decaying; building layers and layers of subterranean techno. It’s making me feel all… um… wisteric. That’s a thing, right?From another website: It’s an album which celebrates and contextualises the heritage of rave while offering a different way to experience it.

Read it all here.This is my countdown of the best electronic albums of 2022, according to my brain, ears and opinion. So far I've mentioned about 60 albums, and we're speeding towards the Top 10. Not before we read about one of the most divisive albums in my list.See the full countdown here.Model Home: Saturn In The Basement (Disciples) My friend Ben tells me the Model Home album is so awful, he may never trust my music taste again. So in true divisive modern-day Twitter style, let me double down on my recommendation.This is a collection of Bandcamp mixtape sounds that don’t just borrow influences as kidnap them at gunpoint. Scuzzy hip hop beats, broken noise experiments that sound like they’re being funnelled through your vacuum cleaner, weird and twisting vocals that make no sense. It’s tough, it’s confusing, it’s inexplicably got a 13-minute scree of moans and clanks. And once it gets under your skin, you’ll be annoying your friends with your frustratingly abstract musical opinions too. Should have recommended The 1975. You know where you are with The 1975.From another website: There is something certifiably ’21st century’ to this kind of sound. It is queasy, anxious and misunderstood and deserves your attention.

Read it all here.The live blogging continues, and this time I feature an artist I first mentioned on this blog in May 2007.See the full countdown here.Luke Vibert: GRIT. (Hypercolour)Electronic Sound: “Well-oiled electro, slippery acid, the rasping hi-hats of his ever-present TR-909, bits that sound like ghosts. What more could you want? Screwfix Typeface is a subdued funk stormer, its strangulated acid sounding like Josh Wink having a coughing fit.” You know what you’re getting with Luke Vibert, in the same way you know what you’re getting with a washing machine or a 5,000 piece jigsaw of my left nipple. Thankfully, Vibert’s 18th album is more rewarding than both of those things. He lets the acid take centre stage, yet isn’t afraid for a bit of melancholy and minor-key mystery in his sassy electro. Hence the bits that sound like ghosts. I get paid to write this stuff, you know. Outrageous.From another website: Twelve pieces of precise and expert acid dance that really highlights just how low-key something can be and still have a magnificent impact.

Read it all here.My album countdown continues, and it's all getting a bit noisy. *bangs ceiling with a broom handle*See the full countdown here.Elektro Guzzi: Triangle (Palazzo Recordings)Electronic Sound: “The three points of this ‘Triangle’ are energy, energy, energy. The Vienna outfit’s ninth album brings us jackhammer beats humming with electric bass... Even as the rhythms splinter into shredded half-beats towards the end, this acoustic techno is angry. Soma in a sulk. Berghain with a beef.” My magazine review made this sound like a right miserable album, but there’s definitely a cheeky glint to the production. The perky hi-hats, the cheerfully buzzy synths, the sheer gasping strength of it all. The speed of Okra would be happy house if it wasn’t for all the, y’know, apocalyptic sounds. This would be the fiercest, fieriest album featured in the Top 20, if I hadn’t just written up the DJ Travella album.Triangle by Elektro GuzziThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022.

I'm parping out the top 20, with the final top 10 following later today. Let's pop to East Africa, shall we?See the full countdown here.DJ Travella: Mr Mixondo (Nyege Nyege Tapes)Suck the citrus from Fruity Loops and instead infuse it with spicy rave nuts and the dripping sweat from an Afrofuturist festival. This is maximalist rave delivered by an energetic East African teenager. Such energy. Frantic rhythms hadron-collided into oblivion, hypercolour synth stabs blatted in your face, crack cocaine drum fills that will make you fall off your seat. Chapa Bakola Music Bass feels like we’re on a merry-go-round toppling off its axis while its plastic horses are trying to hump us. Not often I get to type that. The always fascinating Nyege Nyege Tapes call this “Timbaland conjuring a Thunderdome soundtrack for a Tanzanian street party”. Whatever genre DJ Travella has invented, young Hamadi Hassani, take a bow.From another website: With Mr Mixondo, DJ Travella presents one of the most striking debuts of the year. At just 19, he’s already propositioning himself as a visionary. (The Playground)Mr Mixondo by DJ TravellaThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here."},

We'll resume early tomorrow, climaxing with the number one album of the year around 6pm. Tally ho!See the full countdown here.Daphni: Cherry (Jiaolong)Electronic Sound: “Bish, bash, bosh. That’s what people say when loosely lobbing ingredients into a recipe, isn’t it? Mozzarella. Bash. Chilli power. Bosh. This is Dan Snaith’s third album under his clubbier pseudonym, a decade after his Daphni debut. And like someone concocting punch after drinking half the punch, these short, snappy tracks are designed to be tipped into DJ mixes with wild abandon. The album itself would blend brilliantly…. Turn up the kitchen stereo, throw in some spice: the Caribou lad will be your DJ tonight.” I suspect I was busy burning a Hello Fresh delivery to a cinder while writing that review. Brilliant album, though, especially if you’re keen on Bonobo, Bicep or Four Tet. From another website: A tour de force of dancefloor intuition and emotional release, it has no point to prove; pleasure is the chief, perhaps the only, concern..

Numbers 20 to 11 aren't individually numbered: I've sorted them alphabetically by artist. Let's start with B, which stands for Bot1500.See the full countdown here.Bot1500: Surreal (Lith Dolina)Following a bunch of self-released works, Bot1500, the 1500th of all the bots, makes his album debut on AD-93 offshoot Lith Dolina. Its six tracks with paired titles are deceptively simple. The two Pearl pieces lead us from wavy half-house into deep ambient dub. The skippy breakbeat on Chartreuse 8 is beyond beautiful. And the Crimson tracks prove you don’t need to be drilling a hole through the floor to produce banging house music. I couldn’t tell you much more about Shinichi Kobayashi’s work as Bot1500, but if it’s as enchanting as this, I’m digging right in there. Might start with his slightly spikier 2018 EP Keeper of the Password, which has a curious IDM edge. I wonder what happened to the other 1499 bots?From another website: The loose yet tangled braindance rhythms and crystalline electronics invite the listener on an inner journey.

Fans will recognise the Body Riddle sound, and its skittering, scowling beats will pleaser purists that prefer his dirtier work over his soundtrack work. Including me. Even the quieter recent stuff sounds magnificently disgusting. 05-10 by ClarkSCALPING: Void (Houndstooth)I’ve not yet seen SCALPING live. With their Satanic metal beats, skull-shredding guitar work, and kitten-boiling acid, they’ll probably have me hiding in the toilets until it was over. Who am I kidding. Lay all your grunge on me, SCALPING. The blurb places them somewhere between Black Sabbath and The Bug. I probably couldn’t put it much better.Void by SCALPINGKelly Lee Owens: LP.8 (Smalltown Supersound)“Recorded in a frozen Oslo amid the ongoing disruption of Covid… LP.8 starts with pressure cooker hisses, joined by insistent basement banging and Owens’ breathless repeats of ‘release, release, release’. It sounds like either a command or an increasingly desperate request. Basically, we have a kidnap situation...

Here is the penultimate pick of Top 50 albums before we move into the Top 20. See the full countdown here.Wordcolour: The trees were buzzing, and the grass. (Houndstooth)What a poetic title. This London composer’s debut album utilises voice and performance artists to produce a beautifully beguiling assortment of charming, characterful instruments. Its spoken elements come across as a bit Mike Oldfield, and that’s no bad thing these days. Complex IDM smooths into something more perspex thanks to super-smooth production. And ‘I am sixty years old and trying salvia for the very first time’ is the best track title in this entire countdown.The trees were buzzing, and the grass. by WordcolourCivilistjävel!: Järnnätter (FELT)“Is there truth to the long-lost recordings backstory of Sweden’s Civilistjävel!, or is it smoke and mirrors? This debut on Copenhagen’s FELT opens with the suffering metallic gasps of a rusty iron lung. Warm microbeats bring to mind the mouldy bass fuzz of 1990s B12 and Autechre... Backstory or no backstory, what smokable smoke and lickable mirrors.”Järnnätter by Civilistjävel!Tangerine Dream: Raum (Kscope)“The album is built on Froese’s old Cubase arrangements alongside an Otari tape archive stretching back 45 years. Not that it’s easy to tell the old from the new: this is a superbly kinetic flow of symphonic instrumentals… It might be a long time since, say, the more primal sequences of Phaeda, but with music this positive and transformative, Edgar Froese’s Dream is unlikely to be forgotten.”Raum by Tangerine DreamThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022.

Here are my latest top 50 treats.See the full countdown here.Deepchord: Functional Designs (Soma Records)“Pneumatic bass drums that crumble warehouse walls… The tectonic transcendence of 2017’s ‘Auratones’ is taken deeper. Ambience swarms until it coagulates, turning bass thuds into distant fuzz. Amid miniscule droplets of sound design, muffled drums top 140bpm without seeming to break a stride... And breathe. Feel that warehouse wall. It's not crumbling; it’s floating.”Functional Designs by DeepchordFrantzvaag: Solo Super (Fuck Reality)\"Frantzvaag bursts from the Oslo house scene with this straight-shooting debut album for Smallville’s sweary sublabel. Belatedly unearthed from the label owner’s neglected email inbox, this neat set has cymbal-drenched party pumpers, crowd-pleasing filtered vocals, and elegantly euphoric dubs.

Proper show-off, me.See the full countdown here.Gabe Gurnsey: Diablo (Phantasy Sound)Gabe’s having fun again. When I interviewed him for Electronic Sound a few months ago, he got excited about claps. He just loves his gear. And how that gear throbs and wobbles on this brilliant collection of pumping workouts. It’s massively eighties: just listen to those toms. Central, however, is the voice and vibes of Tilly Morris, whose passionless narration makes everything as cool as head. Clap emoji.Diablo by Gabe GurnseyJared Wilson: From A Different Time (Altered Sense)This Detroit producer dishes out delicious acid bangers. Seriously. These are tasty acid sausages. Pop some sauce on, gobble them all up. Tip them out of the jar, straight down your gullet. Look under your pillow. It’s a sausage! Added to the irresistible acid is a pleasingly loose approach to percussion, weaving us through IDM and old-school breaks territory. Banging.Noda & Wolfers: Tascam Space Season (L.I.E.S.)The Wolfers half of this collaboration is Legowelt, an instant mark of quality. But perhaps key to this album is the presence of Mystica Tribe’s Taka Noda, whose dub credentials elevates Tascam Space Season into something special. These laidback electronic instrumentals echo and delay like nothing else, the bass embedding the whole thing with Orb-ish roots.Tascam Space Season by Noda & WolfersThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here.     Here are more brilliant electronic music albums. We're in the midst of the top 50, with me live blogging a handful of albums at a time until my fingers fall off. No particular order, just a general mulch of top 50-ness.See the full countdown here.Silicon Scally: Field Lines (Central Processing Unit)The bleeps, the bass, the 8-bit vibes. This is electro for electro-heads, with a whole load of 80s film feels to boot. But unlike some other electro albums, it isn’t purely robotic. Amid the mechanical beats is a melodic warmth that gives everything way more heart than you’d expect. Carl Finlow quit a furniture design degree for this. Quite right. Screw those tables.Field Lines by Silicon ScallyDaniel Avery: Ultra Truth (Phantasy Sound)“Let’s fray every edge,” said Danny A about his fifth studio album. Can I call him Danny A? Too late, I’ve said it. This is by far the most low-key album from Avery: a techno titan turns inward with a collection of thoughtful, atmospheric instrumentals. Inspired by, among other things, the Deftones and David Lynch. Includes a stunning tribute to Andy Weatherall. Utterly replayable.Ultra Truth by Daniel AveryBogdan Raczynski: ADDLE (Planet Mu)“This revered drill and basser delivers his first studio album in fifteen years…He’s dumped the farty Nintendo bleeps and firework breaks of 2007’s Alright!. Any clattering percussion seems sonically banished to a room next door, supplanted by a polite vibraphone haze and melodies of heat-melted circuitry. All the whimsy of 2001’s MyLoveILove with all the maturity of years. Revere once again.”ADDLE by Bogdan RaczynskiThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here.     My top 50 favourite electronic music albums continues. Some real crackers here.See the full countdown here.Rival Consoles: Now Is (Erased Tapes)Ah, that Rival Consoles shimmer. It’s his trademark, like the Nike swoosh or my sexy dance moves. The latest album from the London producer feels like Consoles in Luke Abbott mode, letting the fuzzy analogue nature of his gear seep in ever-pleasing ways. It’s certainly a slower listen, with much of his previous drama hazed into a reverby wash. Still shimmering.Now Is by Rival ConsolesPye Corner Audio: Let’s Emerge! (Sonic Cathedral)One of the things I’ve loved about Pye Corner Audio is the electronic drama of it all. The fiercest techno expressed as stately, beatless ambience. Including Ride’s Andy Bell on half of the tracks destroys that drama. The guitar makes it more shoegaze and meandering… but actually, I love it. It’s Pye turned hippy, albeit a hippy bathing in a bath of warm, orange gloop.Let’s Emerge! by Pye Corner AudioWarrington-Runcorn New Town Development Plan: Districts, Roads, Open Space (Castles in Space)While we’re on an ambient tip, here’s are superbly chilled meditations disguised as council blueprints. The ‘Open Space’ of the title describes things perfectly, as these inwardly-focussed reflections build into something quite gorgeous. Lazy loops, blossoming synths, even a touch of ambient acid. Way more interesting than a council planning meeting, although probably as sleep-inducing. Lovely.Districts, Roads, Open Space by Warrington-Runcorn New Town Development PlanThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here.      This is the [mumble]th of ten blog posts laying out numbers 50 to 21 in my end-of-year countdown of the best electronic music albums of 2022. I dunno. I've lost count. I'm typing furiously to stay ahead of my blog schedule, smashed on peanuts, Smarties, Diet Pepsi and Windowlene. Anyway, let's continue. Here are three more albums to pad out this never-ending Top 50.See the full countdown here.Whatever The Weather: Whatever The Weather (Ghostly International) + This was the outing of the new ambient alias from the critically acclaimed London producer Loraine James. The track titles are temperatures, ranging from the scorching 36°C to an exactly freezing 0°C. Which suits the album, because even when she’s dropping beats into the foggy atmosphere, it’s either snowflake crystalline or devilishly scorching. Phew. Also worth checking out is her other 2022 album, the Julius Eastman interpretation Building Something Beautiful For Me (Phantom Limb) – this is also hot / chill stuff.Whatever The Weather by Whatever The WeatherBiosphere: Shortwave Memories (Biophon)Let’s stay with ambience. Apparently Geir Jenssen took inspiration from post-punk for this latest album. You can’t hear much of that in the rich chords, the long structures and that ever-so-90s bass. Instead, thanks to the reintroduction into his sound of vintage analogue synthersisers, we have an evocation of classic Biosphere. Moody and moving ambience.Shortwave Memories by BiosphereMaxime Denuc: Nachthorn (Vlek)I’ll fess up. I used to help organise a rave in a church. It was called TAS:TE, although I can’t for the life of me remember what that stood for. As if treading in my footsteps (ahem), Denuc plays rave music on a church organ. Indeed, it’s all there: the thudding rhythms, the choppy chords, the banging melodies. Except it’s all on a pipe organ. This Album Soars: Totally Ecstatic.Nachthorn by Maxime DenucThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here.     My countdown of my 50 most liked electronic music albums of 2022 continues. I'm splurging out a few albums at a time, so expect a lot of blog posts. It's all pretty much written on the hoof, such is my commitment to journalistic quality. That was sarcasm. Right, here are some more listenings for you.See the full countdown here.Bonobo: Fragments (Ninja Tune)“Simon ‘Bonobo’ Green’s seventh album marks 20 years since he signed to Ninja Tune. That’s half the lifespan of an actual bonobo ape… Gentle clubbiness akin to a desaturated Bicep. What’s different here is the orchestration… This middle-aged ape has indeed orchestrated something glorious and listenable with strings and strings for miles.”Fragments by BonoboJohn Tejada: Sleepwalker (Palette Recordings) You know the drill. Breathless house music, precision engineered to produce exactly the right quantity of joyous ecstasy. I’ve enjoyed his lively Wajatta work with the ever-entertaining Reggie Watts, but it’s nice to be reminded of the slightly more serious synth functionalism of Tejada’s music. Like the city life that clearly inspired it, this album is busy, bustling and full of humanity.Sleepwalker by John TejadaZaliva-D: Misbegotten Ballads (SVBKVLT)This is a special one. This fourth album from Beijing beatmakers Zaliva-D includes: (a) ritualistic gonging rhythms, (b) industrial steel pan electro, (c) bouncing, warping drone work and (d) cartoonish vocals that sound like Cleveland from Family Guy. Didn’t expect that last one, did you? Misbegotten Ballads is a perfect title: if Chinese punks had a fever dream.孽儿谣 Misbegotten Ballads by Zaliva-DThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here.    Here are more of my 50 favourite electronic music albums of 2022, taking us from number 50 to number 21, although not individually ranked within that grouping. In other words, here are some boss albums in no particular order. I'm blogging a handful at a time, and here's your latest lot.See the full countdown here.Salamanda: ashbalkum (Human Pitch)“Can this Seoul pair do no wrong? …At its core are gently palmed drums: meandering marimbas and toms that are an utter sunny delight. Think Facta on a deck chair, Pantha du Prince in a Hawaiian shirt, or a factor-50 slathered Ultramarine. A soft bass adds affable depth; a click snare introduces a perfect level of nod-ability. Such minimalist niceties.”ashbalkum by SalamandaAni Klang: Ani Klang (New Scenery)Klang calls her sound “kickmusik”, a compound noun which makes linguistic sense considering the Berlin influences of her club noises. These energetic, uncompromising dancefloor attacks are indeed like being kicked in the shins, by industrial bass drums, metallic loops and shuddering shrapnels of sound. It’s Slam getting slammed. Kick music? Kor blimey music.Ani Klang LP by Ani KlangT. Gowdy: Miracles (Constellation)This blog post’s selections have been a rhythmic affair. The Montreal sound artist opens Miracles with an excoriating burst of rising static, where the rhythm comes from colliding soundwaves. A bitey, corrugated album of throbbing techno, often beatless, always furiously beating. Originally recorded to accompany surveillance footage, which may explain the superbly sinister overtones.Miracles by T. GowdyThis is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022.

Although they're not presented in any particular order, this next series of blog posts feature albums inside my top 50 but outside the top 20. The kind of chart position that would have been disappointing for Lisa from Steps, but would have been brilliant for H from Steps. I'll blog a few at a time. Here goes!See the full countdown here.Kuedo: Infinite Window (Brainfeeder)I’m not sure an infinite window would work. Where would you put the walls? Despite its architectural impracticality, Jamie Teasdale delivers a stunning selection of keyboard wizardy. From beatless synth shininess to bass-heavy slo-mo electro, this first Kuedo album in six years crosses the full spectrum from noon-bright prog electronics to, er, more noon-bright prog electronics.Infinite Window by Kuedo96 Back: Cute Melody, Window Down! (96 Music)I always thought 96 Back was some moody anonymous geezer, until I saw him in Manchester recently and he chatted excitedly between tracks like a wedding DJ. Lovely guy. He follows a productive 2021 with further forays into synth fun. An ever-inventice collage of beat-bustin’ bangers and Lorenzo Senni-style synth noodles. Plus a more responsible attitude to windows.Cute Melody, Window Down! by 96 BackRobert Ames & Ben Corrigan: Carbs (Nomad Music Productions) There’s a touch of Kiasmos to this collaboration between two esteemed contemporary classical composers. Or perhaps Rival Consoles or Max Cooper. It’s a synth album, but these graceful pieces could easily have been played on a church organ. Listen to the swells, the emotion, the rich dynamics that could only come from a couple of classical kids. Gorgeous.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here.  And now the final set of Commended albums of the year. After this, it's the Top 50, so don't read this blog post too much otherwise you might spoilt your appetite. See the full countdown here.Pole: Tempus (Mute)New glitchy noises from the innovative German composer Stefan Betke. This is a dubbier direction for this uber sound manipulator. It’s like a jazz concert performed in one of those Mission Impossible laser-trip rooms. No sudden moves or the alarms will go off.Walton: Maisie By The Sea (Lith Dolina)Another album that so nearly made my top 50. The Manchester producer steps far away from his Hyperdub bangers. See-sawing ambience morphs into stripped-apart electro morphs into paddy, glitch-hopping drum and bass, and back into shimmering, precise ambience. Nosaj Thing: Continua (LuckyMe)Ah, nice to see Nosaj sticking his, er, nose in. It’s been a while. This is a softer sound than I’ve come to expect from the LA producer. There are nice instrumentals, chilled trip hop, synth-rich ballads. And Coby Sey’s second appearance in this album countdown. Hey, Coby!Pacced Rock: Chapter One - Sonic Levitation (Ilian Tape)The album tracks give a clue. Lotus Root. Levitation. Chilled. A thoroughly retro collection of smokers beats, complete with jazzy loops and full-on head-nodders. Think Rae & Christian, Hudson Mohawke and Prefuse 73. It even comes with Rizla packaging.Michael J Blood x Rat Heart: Nite Mode Vol.1 (BodyTronixxx)Hey, it’s Mr Heart again! Do you reckon that’s his real name? Anyhoo. Mr Blood adds oodles of smooth vibes to this selection of good natured, urban soulbeat instrumentals. Extra points for tracks named after south Manchester streerts. I suspect this will be a staple for party stereos.HiTech: Hitech (FXHE Records)Finally for this list of not-quite-top-50 recommendations, we have a pleasingly breezy album of footwork jams. Imagine Dam Funk after eating a little too much chocolate. The lazy vocals add a repetitive charm, and the energy doesn’t let up. Shouldn’t have mentioned chocolate. Dammit. Someone give me chocolate.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here. Here are more Commended albums. This is the fourth of five such blog posts, after which we'll get into our Top 50. See the full countdown here.Kemetrix: Here and Now (100 Limousines)This is ace. An industrial cybertronic journey into killer robo-beats and movie soundtrackery. Plus the occasional synth stab. Imagine Robocob as lead singer of a disco act. No. Less sexy than you’re imagining. I’d love a list of its 1980s samples. Truly the dark side of Detroit.Zombie Zombie: Vae Vobis (Born Bad) “Taking their cue from Dutch philosopher and Latin purist Erasmus, the electro trio delve deep into the Middle Ages for an album of… let me just check my notes… er, black mass Latinate prog techno-opera. With tonnes of vocoders. Crumbs.” How is this not in my top 50?3Ddancer: new exciting toys (3Ddancer)“Rusted synths pound the dancefloor with little let-up. So much dirty electro. Depraved acid lines catherine-wheel over industrial rhythms. At one point, the beefcake electro of single ‘Botanical Sports’ deflates in a balloon fart of its own eroded ecstasy.”Richie Culver: I was born by the sea (REIF)The following line is all you really need to know about this album. “There’s more mobility scooter repair shop and bookies, than there are bookshops.” This Withernsea-themed debut album is full of gruff Blackhaine-style macho ambience. Dark, biographical, essential.The Ephemeron Loop: Psychonautic Escapism (Heat Crimes)We’ve had some real experimentalism in this lot. Brace yourself. On Psychonautic Escapism we have apocalyptic screaming, dubby drones and Blanck Mass-style euphori-noir. The blurb compares it to Cocteau Twins and Napalm Death. It’s addictive, and puts the zen into brazen.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here. We march on with the countdown. These are commended albums, which is a polite way of saying they didn't make my final top 50. You should listen to them anyway, to avoid social embarrassment more than anything.This is the third of five Commended blog posts. See the full countdown here.33: 33-69 (C.A.N.V.A.S.)This so nearly made the top 50. It’s a bewildering listen. Choral slowness over jagged strings, machine-gun electro undercutting an undecipherable tannoy blah, something that sounds like Bjork using a dance pad made of knives. I mean, yikes. So very nearly.Ailie Ormston and Tim Fraser: It Changes (Bison)Proper composers, these two. Here we have complex, tangled classical music inspired by dance music, although the references are suggested rather than upfront. Apparently, the UK rave anthem Can Set You Free is a musical motif, although it would be a while before you’d notice.Chouk Bwa & The Angströmers: Ayiti Kongo Dub (Les Disques Bongo Joe)Haitian hardcore dance music. Let’s type that again. Haitian hardcore dance music. Delivered in two volumes, these beats are equally uncompromising as they are cheery. The melodic vocals are pure Caribbean sunshine, yet the sunshine is submerged in an underground warehouse. Brill.Coby Sey: Conduit (AD 93)Sey’s deadpan spoken word is our hook into what otherwise would be album of obscure, narcotic Tricky-style loops. “Marking the past,” he says over and over again. You can really feel London DIY culture writ large and presented without polish. V. real.Kakuhan: Metal Zone (NAKID)Classical music is merely a jumping off point on an album in which strings are pitched into a deep chasm of warped, broken electronics. One online commenter describes it as “Someone handed Arthur Russell a bunch of Photek records.” Not easy, always interesting.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here. Here are more commended albums that didn't quite make my top 50. Each one is a peach, or a pair, or a pineapple. You pick the fruit, I'm not fussy.This is the second of five Commended blog posts. See the full countdown here.Caterina Barbieri: Spirit Exit (light-years)This is the third album from the acclaimed synth experimentalist, and this time it’s inspired by female mystics. Despite being produced during the introspection of lockdown, Barbieri is typically light of touch. Elegiac, worshipful and drifting, and wonderfully listenable.Rat Heart Ensemble: A Blues (Shotta Tapes)Mr Heart abandons the dancefloor for a long, post-disco sleep. Boomkat gave this Mancunian’s Tascam driftings their Album of the Year accolade. Dark ambient pieces drifting from littered side alleys, echoing drones reverberating from smoking manholes. Waves: Low Altitude (self-released)“This is a coastal collection of cockle-shelled ambience, barnacled synth meditations and sea-bound drones as wide-reaching as far-flung fish. There are lapping shorelines, seagulls, even a humming lighthouse… Manchester finally has its beach.”Romance & Dean Hurley: In Every Dream Home A Heartache (Ecstatic)Speaking of ambient. David Lynch collaborator Dean Hurley produces an album of hazy, filmic ambience. Each set of wandering loops will run a movie reel in your head: abandoned beaches, sun-dappled forests, buffalo doing a tango. Okay, maybe not that last one.Ulla: Foam (3XL)This has been a really woozy set of recommendations, and this product of the US Midwestern ambient scene is no less heady. Imagine setting off a synth arpeggio, but then feeding the audio through a mincer, then making a lovely lemon mousse with the remains. That.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022. Read it all here. Before we get to the top 50 best albums of 2022, here are some records that didn't quite make the cut. No particular reason. It's just how it all shook down when I was compiling stuff. Everything here is 100% worth your time, energy and ears.I'll split this into five blog posts, with about four or five in each. See the whole countdown here.Stephen Mallinder: tick tick tick (Dais Records)“Its headline instruments are gorgeous bristly basslines that sometimes lead the march, and sometimes get caught in swirls of equally rhythmic lead synth…. Thank goodness Mallinder has rediscovered his solo groove. This ticks the boxes. All three of them.”Soichi Terada: Asakusa Light (Rush Hour)Festival-friendly house music from a Japanese video game soundtracker. Imagine playing an immersive game but wrapped in cotton wool and there’s an especially friendly manatee giving you a foot massage. Simply a whole bunch of nice.Brassfoot: SWEAT (NCA)Brassfoot runs a cassette tape label for experimental music, so this scuzzy techno has all the hissy roughness you’d expect. Warehouse bangers, chopped synth loops, lots of claustrophobia. You could probably play it on a 78 as well as cassette, I’d imagine.Decius: Decius Vol. I (The Leaf Label)The newly formed Decius would make a great accompaniment to Mallinder. Mechanical beats meet clipped acid and pumping electronic disco. Features Lias Saoudi from Fat White Family. Keyboard workouts to keep you going until the milkman delivers.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2022.

The last thing we need is someone waffling about his favourite albums of the year, right?You're wrong! We need this kind of blather more than ever. My best-of album countdown returns. I'm about to plonk 36 blog posts on your computer / Nokia / abacus screen. Here's what you can expect.This is a list of my favourite electronic music albums of the year. I will mention 75+ albums, although the list is not complete nor authoritative. I will omit obvious choices, and I will make mistakes. I'm writing this within minutes of the first blog post going online, and it's all pretty much written (a) as live and (b) as a first draft. Expect it to be an absolute cack-pot of steaming gunk, and we can take it from there.I will present you with the following sexy selections. Within each section, I won't rank each album in order. Gone are the days of sorting these numerically. What's the point: if I was blogging this next week, the whole order would shuffle anyway.Commended Electronic Music Albums – albums that didn't make my final top 50Top 50 Electronic Music Albums – what would have otherwise been numbers 50 to 21Top 20 Electronic Music Albums – what would have otherwise been numbers 20to 11Top 10 Electronic Music Albums – what would have otherwise been numbers 10 to 2The number one best electronic music album of 2022This will be laid out as 36 blog posts publishing between now and 9pm today, then resuming on New Year's Eve starting in the morning and ending at around 6pm. Plenty of time after that for you to get all dressed up for Jool's Hootenanny. Holland loves his glad rags.It's important that this album countdown doesn't take over my entire life, so I will probably do fewer graphics and slightly shorter write-ups. It was a bit stressful last year. If a review is \"written in speech marks, like this\", the text is taken from my Electronic Sound magazine review of that album.This all said, every album on this countdown is something I have properly liked or appreciated in 2022, so it's all pucker and brilliant and thank you in advance for wiping your reading eyes across my hastily written words.Let's go.

{"title": "Token November post with added Subway shutter", "date": "Nov 30, 2022", "text": "I can't let November pass by without at least one blog post, so here's what I've up to this past month (or so). Think of it as a show-and-tell although I'm not going to show you anything, and what I tell you will be pretty dull.Plaid played the White Hotel in Manchester. It's a no-frills venue that makes you feel like you're about to get murdered by a Tesco Value murderer. But the sound system's great, the staff are lovely, and there's always a nice crowd. Highlight was the dizzying peaks of C.A. from their new album Feorm Falorx.I nuzzled my nozzle in nostalgia at the Warehouse Party's Hacienda 40 bash. Orbital, 808 State, Graeme Park, Happy Mondays, Justin Robertson, K-Klass, Jon DaSilva, A Guy Called Gerald. It kind of boiled down to a warehouse full of men dancing like Bez, but there were lots of fun chats, and Orbital were all kinds of ace.The Delightful Sausage delighted me for a second time this year when I saw their Nowt But Sea show again. The friendly farce is shot through with daftness and nods to classic TV comedy tropes. Amy and Chris are so good together, and there's an extended reminiscence by Chris which I just think might be genius.With a clutch of cartoon cats, I read a co-written story with my embarrassingly talented writing buddy David Hartley. Fellow scribe and word-reader Adam Farrer sums things up pretty nicely when he posted on Instagram: \"Got to hang out with some brilliant folks, sold some books and saw @fat_roland dressed up in a cardboard disguise, reading a story off the back of a cat’s head. It’s all I wanted from today.\"Oh and I took a selfie in front of a colourful shop shutter (see above). I think it was a Subway. It was very late at night and colder than a whittler's canoe.Not a bad November-ish overall, hey."},

{"title": "Prodigy's Experience turns 30: that's a lot of small furry animals", "date": "Sep 30, 2022", "text": "The Prodigy's debut album Experience was released 30 years ago this week. It only seems like yesterday! Which is nonsense. 30 years is flipping ages ago. Shrews tend to live for less than 12 months. 30 years is over 30 full shrew generations. In human years, this means Experience came out during the reign of Julius Caesar. I hope you're following me on this.I'm not sure Experience did much to separate the Prodigy from the xylophone-clonking mass of novelty ravers at the time. Their transformation into aggressive firestarters was some years down the line. But Charly pouncing into the top ten in summer 1991 was quite the landmark moment.The best thing about that album is it's daft. Look at the lyrics. \"Feel the bass come down on me  baby… Give me a number one, give me a number two.. . I take your brain to another dimension, pay close attention.\"And whatever that cartoon cat was miaowing about. The boy tells us he was mewling road safety messages. I'm not convinced. Personally, I think Little Johnny 2D-face was gaslighting that poor cat. Let it dance into the road, you monster. Let it high five the cats eyes. This was originally meant to be a deep analysis of Experience, track by track, with 3,000-word essays and everything. However, I'm too busy listening to the new Bjork album to, er, pay close attention. Let's just say it's a classic that sounds as wild now as it ever did. Even better, actually, now we can consider Experience without the shadow of Jilted Generation, Fat Of The Land and all the chart-topping tomfoolery that came along with them. Let's finish this with some Amazon reviews of Experience. Really pay tribute to a great album. the album i received is absolutely shocking quality it jumps on every track, such a shame - one starRecord just doesn’t work, keeps skipping and jumping. Not pleased with this product - one starI ordered it twice and both times the records jumped! Very disappointed - one starThe record arrived warped and not even close to being level. It wobbles on our record player - one starOrdered Prodigy - Experience.... received Jimi Hendrix album. Rubbish - one starOh. Erm. Oops."},
{"title": "The downfall of Ian Brown", "date": "Sep 26, 2022", "text": "Monkey-faced Mancunian Ian Brown is being roasted on Twitter for a gig he did in Leeds.His concert at the O2 Academy Leeds on 25 September was part of his first solo headline tour in over ten years. And when he means 'solo', he really means 'solo'. Videos abound of him alone on the stage, drawling to a backing track.One tweet has him murdering FEAR, Another tweet posted a clip of him looking distinctly lonely on stage as he sang First World Problems. The tweeter said:\"turn up to his £40 a ticket, sold out gig at leeds tonight WITH NO BAND. I’m a life long fan but it was bad. #ianbrown does karaoke and butchers his own tunes. Most were too pissed to care but I had to get out after this one. Longsight M13 was a highlight.\"It wasn't all negative. A guy called Ryan said, \"You absolutely smashed it tonight… You had the place bouncing and your performance was electric.\" While another complainer seemed disappointed with his singing and his lack of band, yet found it in their heart to say, \"he still has the swagger and he’s still a legend in my eyes\"You can't really roast Ian Brown for singing out of tune. The whole point of Manchester acts like Brown and the Happy Mondays and Mark E Smith is that they sound like boozed-up karaoke. It's kicking-out time at the Brass Neck & Baggie and Uncle Darren's off on one. This is what marketers call a unique selling point. But it's a bit of a cheek to turn up without a backing band. I'm quite happy for, say, Karl Hyde from Underworld to be a one-man car wash inflatable, flailing around while Rick Smith keeps himself to himself behind his keyboards. But for indie bands, you need the guitars. The musicianship. Something for beardy journalists to write about in Mojo magazine.He'll appreciate the extra cash pocketed from not paying a band, though. His caché has been increasingly passée in recent years. He's been churning out Covid-19 conspiracy theories, resulting in him being thrown off Twitter and losing a song on Spotify. I think at one point he used the phrase \"lame stream media\", which instantly loses him any credibility.Twitter will have its fun. There will be lots more Brown bashing, mostly from people who didn't attend the gig. I still remember a recent tweet showing a few seconds of Mick Hucknall singing off key at a recent performance. People were scandalised. And they ignored a similar clip of Hucknall recently singing like the angels; a stunning set of pipes. Twitter's engine runs on decontextualized outrage. With someone as odious as Ian, it couldn't happen to a better person.Is this the downfall of Ian Brown? Not for a minute. Do you really think his anti-vax rants will play badly to ageing bucket-heads? Although he may lose a few ticket sales, is his career really going to be harmed by singing like a drunken monkey man on the loose? Not a bit of it.No. I reckon the worst is to come. Ian Brown is a crusty old white man with big opinions and a screw-them attitude. He is privilege, he is patriarchy, he is Morrissey. The controversy that fully downs his career hasn't happened yet. He'll overstep the mark in some horrible way. Say the 'n' word, become the new Savile, set fire to an orphanage? Probably not. But something.To quote one of his songs: \"I swim with the fishes; you come from the sea. The dolphins were monkeys that didn't like the land.\"Nope. Me neither.Further Fats: Who do I hate more?

{"title": "It's got a cow as a logo", "date": "Aug 31, 2022", "text": "This weekend I went to Moovin Festival. It's got a cow as a logo. Moo. Moovin Festival.It's a tiny music festival nestled in Etherow Country Park in Stockport. Lots of tree-covered rolling hills, an impressive multi-layered weir, and tonnes of geese honking all over the place. Actually proper gorgeous. Let's talk about the music. I loved Mikey Don's showmanship. Northbase and Mickey Finn brought some mad drum and bass. DJ Frosti provided a welcome shot of dubby progressive house. Black Grape replaced the Sugarhill Gang on the bill, which doesn't seem like a fair swap, but suited a crusty Mancunian like me. Shaun Ryder stood reading his lyrics from an autocue while a sprightly Kermit ping-ponged around the stage bringing the party. It was kind of wonderful, and they reminded me how much of a tune Reverend Black Grape is. The main reason why I was there was Orbital. They seemed on cheery form, and blasted us with their usual Satanic charms. At one point I got so excited, I turned to my fellow dancers and shouted \"come oooon!\". Someone shook my hand. You can see me significantly enjoying myself in the above photograph, taken by Orbital themselves. To my surprise, Orbital weren't the number one highlight of the weekend. I was there on my own, and most of the line-up, especially on the Sunday, held no interest for me. So a lot of the time, all I had to do was sit and chat to random people. And what people! I've never had so many random conversations, with one guy even scaling a hill just to talk to me. I've already done this on Twitter, but I must give a shout out to Rafe for his easy hospitality and the lift home, and Alex and Myles who became immediate mates and absolutely made my Sunday.This was the best fun in a Stockport park since I went joyriding in a milk float. Would recommend.What a great evening at @moovinfestival !

The camping was a little tough because I am now as old as a mountain, but with the help of a hastily-bought camping chair and a steady supply of Tango, I got through it just fine. Festivals are back! Woo!BlueDot is a science and music festival based at Jodrell Bank, which is a clever science centre with a telescope that looks like a satellite dish. You know the scaffolding that Tom Baker Doctor Who fell to his death from? It’s based on that telescope. It’s a small, chilled festival full of nice people. You should go.I’m going to reel through everything I saw and did, so brace yourself. This is a quick and dirty blog post, so it’s all first draft. No photos – you can find them on Twitter by searching for fatroland and the blue dot emoji. Right. Let’s do some words. Let’s go!Sunday’s main headliner was the Halle Orchestra featuring Bjork. So good, I cried twice. She was as otherworldly as ever – you can google the costume she was wearing. But she was also earthy and emotional, and she did old tracks like ‘Come To Me’ which made me a very happy boy indeed. The orchestra was phenomenal, and reminded me that there are certain melodic arrangements that sound very Bjork indeed. It’s not all about the voice, as it happens.I ought to take this chance to tell you that I have also sung with the Halle Orchestra. I was a founding member of Manchester Boys Choir, and we sung in proper concerts and everything. We even did Songs of Praise. I’m not saying that makes me as good as Bjork and/or Jesus. I’m not saying that. That is for you to decide. Ahem.Mandy, Indiana knocked the tent pegs out of the place with their claustrophobic drums and apocalyptic Frenchness. The lead singer took a bad tumble on stage and ended the gig laughing like a maniac. Breathtaking start to finish.This seems like stating the obvious, but Yard Act were cheeky, hilarious and very Yorkshire. I loved the bit where he railed against middle-class kids and their confectionary, then tried to list as many middle-class kid sweets as he could. Frubes. He mentioned Frubes. Also worth including in this very-Yorkshire section is the Eccentronic Research Council, whose brilliant festival-closing set involved some amazing gruffness and Maxine Peake reading out people’s dreams. Adrian really does have a very impressive hat.It was so great to see Kelly Lee Owens, who trod a perfect line between Canderel-sweet vocal harmonies and grubby warehouse techno devastation. She clashed with Groove Armada, but this was an easy choice. Kelly Lee flipping Owens.Anna Meredith took to main stage and converted everyone to her tuba techno and her bold, brassy, brainy beats. And her digital Tom Cruise. So much fun. Last gig of the year as she turns her focus to album production.I got to see Koreless, my album of the year for last year. Intricate, powerful, all the good things – but cut short because I had to pop off to Squarepusher. Mr Pusher was in a furious mood, barraging us with audio fractals for a solid hour before allowing even a slight notion of melody to show its face. ‘Detroit People Pusher’ was a fractured highlight. Cracking stuff.Jane Weaver revived the spirit of melodic 1990s indie and put in a remarkable and mesmerising set. Head and shoulders above most of her peers. I’ve seen LoneLady several times since I did my interview with her for Electronic Sound magazine, and it was good to see her on a proper big stage. Front rail, boogied a lot, sorted.Hannah Peel and her Paraorchestra was a fine appetiser on a quiet Thursday. Norrisette brought some quirky and masked Stockport realness to the festival. Dirty Freud reminded us of 1990s trip hop. Caro C did a delightfully engaging performance of her Electric Mountain album, complete with found sounds. All rather smashing.What else? Henge once again beamed in from space to deliver their mix of Spinal Tap and Galaxy Quest fun. Always good value. Sad Night Dynamite were fun too but probably more aimed at kids. I saw some Sea Fever, the projected by Johnny Marr’s bass player Iwan Gronow. Sounds From The Other City did a colossal DJ takeover – another great festival you should check out. Tim Burgess knocked out some Charlatans numbers on main stage, which was endearing, like watching your poodle dance on its back legs. There was Mogwai too. But I didn't watch them. Soz.Among the non-music things I saw were Matthew Cobb talking about brains and entertaining us with AI-generated Love Hearts slogans, comedian Bec Hill and maths funny man Matt Parker doing a live podcast and Brainiac Live doing science experiments probably – I missed almost all of it because I was chatting and facing the wrong way. I caught A Certain Ratio talking about the olden days with affection and humility. Anna Meredith ran an album listening session which was engaging and funny. The spoken word artist ROY did a hugely enjoyable and expletive-ridden reading and Q&A.Oh and astronaut Tim Peake talked about being astronaut Tim Peake. This was amazing because he’s a chuffing astronaut and I am most definitely not a chuffing astronaut. Or perhaps I am an astronaut. Perhaps I am. That is for you to decide.A few personal things. Shout out to my camping buddies Deb and Tom and Michelle, and to the many friends I hung out with. BlueDot is a bit like everyone in Manchester dumped into a field. Hat doff to Ben, to Adrian, to Helen, to Electronic Sound, to my Blackwell’s buddies, and to Dave and Hannah whose BlueDot experience was robbed by Covid.Would I go again? Of course. I’m addicted to this festival. It perhaps needs more stalls and traders, and more places to buy a bacon butty, and less sponsorship from Dyson which was a bit odd. But the food was immense (masala dosa!), the stewarding was great, and I got to be in a room with a flipping astronaut. Well. Not quite in a room. Outside the tent. Sat against a fence. Just enjoying the BlueDot space vibes. Brill."},

That magazine there! Hello? Hello?\" Turns out strangers don't like it when you shake them by their lapels.Writing my column for Electronic Sound is the longest job I've ever had. The magazine started as just 'Electronic', no doubt named after Bernard Sumner's best band. It has been iPad-only, a digital edition with interactive buttons, but most of all it has been a gorgeously produced print magazine. My column has featured in every edition. It's amazing what an steam-powered automatic sentence generator can do. I've been illustrating it since early 2020, a move which single-handedly brought on an international pandemic.The column is still going strong, as are my \"illustrations\" (which are actually high-resolution 4D photographs, they just look like cartoons due to the limitations of the human eye). The mag has exciting plans for the future, and I'm happy to say I'm now part of Electronic Sound Premium. This means that, by pressing a few groats into their palm, you can read loads of my columns. They've given them titles titles like 'Unnecessarily Repetitive', 'Why Am I Not A Famous Novelist?' and  'I Am So Very Good At Kicksporting Football Soccer'.Writing for Electronic Sound continues to be great fun. The columns come easy (although they're often second columns having written a burner column just to get to the \"good\" stuff). The illustrations are harder, especially as I never write the columns with an illustration in mind. I like to test myself. I occasionally sneak in references to the magazine in my cartoons, sometimes in number plates and sometimes as morse code in a Daft Punk visor (see picture). I also write features and reviews, and scrawl \"FRAT ROLEND IS TH BESST\" on every page in invisible ink.Big up to Push and the gang for continuing to publish and, worryingly, encourage me. I'll finish this with a beautiful poem. It's composed from bits of first lines from some of columns. Imagine you're reading Shakespeare or Carol Ann Duffy or a crossword.

However, Blogger has a limited enough reach these days without profanity filters further restricting its readability. They're still a thing, right? Internet filters? Fudge knows. Guests on the P*cky Bs podcast nominate:a new album for review, a classic album that none of us have heard, and a personal favourite artist. It's a bit like Desert Island Discs without the benefit of a free holiday and the chance to boast that you've been on Radio 4 at parties.Let's go through those choices.For the new release, I plumped for Moderat's unexpected fourth album More D4ta. I'd not had a chance to listen to it, so what better to introduce myself to the album while surrounded by three grumpy podcasters primed to tear my music taste apart.For the classic, I chose Depeche Mode's debut Speak & Spell, an album which contrasts with their later work for reasons I explain in the episode. This choice was a risk, because the Pick* Bs are young and cool while I am old and decrepit. I feared I would present myself as a crusty old pensioner brandishing a dusty gramophone and wax-bunged ear trumpet. As it happens, (a) Speak & Spell is way before my time so shut up, and (b) my fellow podcasters' response was surprisingly positive.My favourite band p*ck was Orbital. I don't need to explain this. If you're reading my blog and haven't picked up on the fact I'm obsessed with Orbital, you are as dense as a black hole or an actual hole.We also reviewed Ethel Cain, who I was a bit harsh about but find more of a connection with later in the episode, Poliça, who I quite liked despite my pronunciation of their name, and Post Malone, who... you'll just have to listen to the episode.This was immense fun, and it's always a treat to hang out with fellow music nuts.

{"title": "Are number one singles getting shorter? (TL;DR: #1s shorter Y/N?)", "date": "Jul 12, 2022", "text": "Are number one singles getting shorter?Harry Styles amiable earworm As It Was (pictured) spent ten weeks at number one recently. That's more than double the chart-topped weeks achieved by all of One Direction's singles combined. He's a one-man One Direction twice over.One of the most notable things about the track is its brevity. It's short, like my trousers, my temper or this senten--. It doffs its polite hat for a bit then, at two minutes 44 seconds, bows out quicker than you can say Larry Stylinson.When I think of singles that camp out at number one for ages, I think of really long songs. Epics like Bohemian Rhapsody and that archery song by Bryan Adams. And quite right. If a track is going to wedge itself in the top spot for what seems like an eternity, it had better have some heft. BoRap was just shy of six minutes. Ten-weeker I Will Always Love You was almost five minutes long. Almost five excruciating, ear-destroying minutes.Styles isn't the only shortie to shoot his shot at number one. TikTok star Gayle's abcdefu comes in at two minutes 54 seconds, two minutes 53 of which are very rude words indeed. The current number one is LF System's Afraid To Feel. This is essentially a caffeinated sample of 1970s funk band Silk, and it comes in at just two minutes 54 seconds. The 3 minutes 30 seconds of Dave's Sinatra-themed chart topper Starlight seemed like Homer's Odyssey in comparison.Obviously, there are still longer chart-topping singles in the 2020s. Adele knows how to string out a narrative, and those LadBaby lads certainly know how to string out their sausages. It just seems these days, we're more likely to get a Stormzy or 24KGolden dropping something brief. Not dropping their briefs. That's an entirely different thing.Let's take a quick sample of the charts ten years ago as a comparison. All the number ones are long. Maroon 5, Florence & The Machine, Gotye: their four or five minute structures feel substantial. Strong. Beefy. They were proper units.Is this the result of the truncated window of Instagram or TikTok? Pruned because of the platform? you can be more throwaway if you're not traipsing into town to buy the vinyl from HMV. Soundcloud dump? Make 'em short, it doesn't matter.I haven't done much analysis, and I certainly haven't done what I should have done: entered every number one's track length into a spreadsheet and pressed a lot of complicated buttons. In fact, this entire blog post took one minutes 22 seconds to write, which is half a Harry Styles, or about 0.00001% of that archery song."},
{"title": "Crabby birthday: The Prodigy's Fat Of The Land turns 25", "date": "Jun 30, 2022", "text": "The Prodigy's Fat Of The Land was released 25 years ago today. It was the fastest selling UK album of all time, and propelled the Prodge to the top of the charts with Firestarter and Breathe.The album cover featured a zoomed-in shot of gecarcinus lateralis, otherwise know as a Bermuda land crab. It's a species of crab that is quite happy to hang out on beaches without rock pools, as long as the sand is moist enough for its gills to operate. They tend to be vegetarian, but will chomp on animal matter if needs be. Crab facts!I'd make a cake to celebrate this anniversary, but the Prodigy never struck me as a cake kind of band. They seemed to hang out in grotty basements while writhing in threatening ways. Feels like an unhealthy place for a cake.Fat Of The Land was incendiary. The single Smack My Bitch Up attracted claims of misogyny. Yeah, the word bitch is ugly, but I betcha if the protagonist in the video hadn't been a woman, no-one would have batted an eyelid at the video's hellraising. They should have got me to star in it. I would have stayed in listening to Future Sound of London and playing Boggle.The album also gave us Keith Flint, God rest his sausages. The pointy-haired bovver boy became the face of rebellion in the 1990s. Keith Flint was quite happy to hang out on beaches without rock pools, and would chomp on animal matter if needs be. Apparently, Keith used to go on motorcycle rides with the saxophonist of Madness. That's an actual fact and not some nonsense about crabs. Who knew.Music for the Jilted Generation was a more artistically interesting album as it turned a band bordering on novelty rave into a serious act. But Fat Of The Land might the most important. Along with the Shamen, it thrust proper dance music into the uber-mainstream while, perhaps unlike the Shamen,  losing little of its musical power.It didn't impress everyone. To finish off this short waffle, here are some reviewers who didn't get along with the fat, the land and everything between.Leftin, AmazonSexist lyrics set to appalling neo-metal/house bilge. One star.Anonymous review, Entertainment.ieI didn't want to admit it. I refused to accept it.

The bass kicks hard and my car has reasonably good speakers. But I found myself turning it down as I drove through areas with a lot of people on the road in case they laughed at me for listening to such a cheesy, dated and worn out record.Carlos Mancilla, AmazonThe album arrived a little bent at the top corner leaving a wrinkle in the cardboard.Peter Barczak, AmazonOnly bought cos it was a penny. Not played it yet. Three stars.All of these reviewers need rock pools for survival, and so are limited in the range of beaches available to them.

It's a cracking tune and all, but here is a list of eight tracks that definitely deserve a Kate-style comeback.Ash: Sick PartyAt the end of Ash's album 1977, there's a hidden track featuring the band vomiting in their studio. Felix's classic house track Don't You Want Me kept Ash's Girl From Mars out of the top ten, so maybe that's what they're thinking about when spilling their innards. I can think of no better song that sums up current society than the sound of musicians delivering pavement pizza.Aphex Twin: MilkmanThis mid-1990s track features a rare moment of intelligible vocals on an Aphex Twin track. The song is about how someone wants the milkman to pop round so they can breast-feed from the milkman's wife. It's a classic 1990s track in that it's disturbing, performatively weird, and lazily misogynistic. Let's get it to number one for 47 weeks.Jake Paul: It's Everyday BroI haven't heard this song by Jake Paul. In fact, I have absolutely no interest in Jake Paul. I know he used the n-word, has called Covid a hoax, has faked a marriage, has used a riot for clicks, has been accused of sexual assault and has a brother who has used suicide for laughs. Somehow, he feels like the hero this rotten world deserves right now. Give him a Grammy.Muse: Supermassive Black HoleThis song was everywhere when it came out. We were all humming it. But now? No-one can remember how it goes. Go on. Sing it. You can't, can you. The place where it should be lodged in our memory is now a void. Amazingly, the song has become its own title. Musical antimatter that, upon returning to number one, will suck in all the gravity from our hopes and dreams.Sam And Mark: With A Little Help From My FriendsClearly better than the Beatles' version, this Sgt. Pepper classic scored Sam and Mark a number one single in 2004. It denied Ronan Keating a fourth solo number one single. This means Sam and Mark are the greatest entertainment duo in history, and that includes Danger Mouse and Penfold. I wish they could be my friend. By the way, I am high on spice right now.The Teletubbies: Cha Cha SlideThe fact these multicolour morons have never done a cover version of DJ Casper's exorable party song is entirely irrelevant. This imaginary song wot I just made up deserves a revival in 2022. Christmas number one! This year's big charity hit! The subject of a miming scandal! Let's make the Teletubbies notorious for a track that doesn't even exist.Axomrph: kebb sn Onfule XbSee? That's just letters. It's not even a thing. I just ran my tongue along my keyboard and it came out. Let's get it to number one. Put it out on marbled vinyl. Stick it in all the Spotify playlists. Have an oompah band perform it on Good Morning Britain. Here, let's write the disappointing follow-up single. *drops my trousers and slaps my wang across the punctuation keys*Orbital: HalcyonSeriously. It should be number one. Why did it never get to number one? It's clearly deserving of number one. I was joking all the other times. But this really should be number one. Please make it number one.

{"title": "This got me: the infuriating pizza pop", "date": "May 31, 2022", "text": "There’s an advert that is getting on my wick. It’s twisting my melon. It’s doing my noggin in.I don’t want to mention the brand because I don’t want to give them clicks. It’s a pizza company. They’re named after the table-top game in which you link together spotted tiles. You know the one. Stand the tiles vertically then watch them fall over one after another. Yes. That pizza company.The advert appears when I watch YouTube on my mobile phone, or on any device that hasn’t got an ad-blocker. It’s maybe only ten seconds long, but it’s a lot. A LOT. I’d embed it for you, but I can’t find it on YouTube. Let me describe it.It leads with rhythmic music: staccato percussion that sounds like a woodblock pinball machine. Cue a meaningless montage of pizza images. Once the rhythm has looped, it adds on more percussion, as if a drum kit is trying to hump another drum kit. More meaningless images. As it reaches its conclusion, it coalesces into an urgent tick-tick-tick climax.And then it commits a cardinal sin.The final sound is meant to be one last percussive hurrah, like the closing bwoom in the Countdown clock music. The sound is someone popping their mouth with a finger. Like you do when you’re imitating a balloon pop. Puffed cheek, pursed lips, finger in and *pop*. Except the finger-pop is not in time. It comes in slightly early, just before the 1-beat of the 4/4 rhythm. It’s meant to sound offbeat and syncopated, but it just sounds like a mistake. Jarring enough for me to vomit up my pizza.I know commercials are meant to be in-your-face. And this kind of straight-jacket techno is not unusual in idents. There’s another advert that’s meant to feel trip-hoppy but it just sounds like someone’s copied-and-pasted from sample pack. An audio shrug. I get it. Remember the Babylon Zoo advert disappointment in which the glorious spacy techno turned out to be indie sludge? Electronic music succumbed to capitalism a long time ago.But this ad is infuriating. It has me jabbing the ‘skip’ button in the same way I dive for the tuning button whenever the Archers theme tune comes on. Not that I listen to Radio 4 much anymore: I’m a podcast earwigger because I’m cool and trendy.I’m also annoyed at their “We got this” slogan. While recognising the importance of not being prescriptive about grammar, especially when it comes to representing idioms from minority cultures, this is just dumb. That phrase is nothing to do with pizza or what they do as a company. It’s ad execs throwing a scrabble set into a toilet bowl and apple-bobbing for the fewest letters possible.I’m also annoyed that I’ve ordered so much pizza, I’m being bombarded with pizza adverts left, right, centre and everywhere else. Serves me right for accepting cookies. Computer cookies, that is. The last thing I need after a pizza is even more dietary trash.So there you go. My rant about an advert. This blog provides cutting edge content. Next up, I’m going to write a diatribe about people commenting on YouTube vid***POP***See? It’s annoying, isn’t it."},

This proves that books are evil and must be stopped before they destroy us all.Those 18 days were so weird. The NHS website lists 12 distinct Covid symptoms. I had every single one, some lasting a couple of days, others lasting longer. An ever-evolving patchwork of ailments,layering over each other for extra annoyance.Of course, I'm lucky. I'm fully jabbed and I made it through to the other side in one piece. But it's not an experience I'm keen to repeat. The brain fog, the isolation, the lost weeks.

This means I was born in Manchester, which famously invented Vimto, the computer, and mouthy lead singers who say \"sun-sheeiiine\" instead of \"sunshine\".What Manchester might not be as famous for is the apiarian emblem of the worker bee. The Victorians invented this when their graphic design department was trying to come up with something to represent Manchester's industrial ambitions. They made a coat of arms with bees buzzing around the globe. Cute, if impractical for international trade.There are bees everywhere in Manchester. On the street furniture. Sprayed onto walls. Actual bees. I do like the symbol of the bee. It reminds us of the mill workers in the olden days who used to dress in stripes and suck on flowers. Even today, if you squeeze a Mancunian, a little bit of honey comes out.Other cities' emblems are much worse. Birmingham is just a pile of spaghetti to represent its road system. No sauce, no nothing. London has a corgi driving a red bus. And Glasgow has a man screaming into a drain. Lovely, but not as good as Manchester.This vague bee blather was inspired by this bee design on Manchester Metropolitan University's student union building. It doesn't quite work because the lines are too thin, and are lost amid the brickwork. But I like the idea of students getting bee-indoctrinated.

An unbloggy Fat Roland is a sad Fat Roland.But I'm not sad this month. I've been a busy boy, so I'm going declare this past month a blogging holiday. And all the weeks I didn't blog before that: they were blog hols too. And blog holidays are allowed. The only reason why I'm writing this post now is so I've published something in the month of March, and I don't look back in a few years' time and feel disappointed at my blogless month. But hey. I'm still on blogging holiday. Look, I'm wearing a sombrero and drinking a pina colada. Holiday.Tomorrow is different. Tomorrow is April. I need to get back to blogging in April. If I'm not posting sixteen blog posts a day throughout April, I am a failure of a human being. Every blog post will have complex diagrams and be translated into four different languages. It'll all be in 3D and also rendered as a liquid. It's going to be the best wordings on the internet ever. No pressure.It's weird how well Blogger works for me. I'm not interested in its custom domains or its new themes. I just want a nice plain design that I can Photoshop into looking a bit better. It's immediate and encourages play: a sandpit of a writing environment. Blogger has served me well for the past, approximately, 17 and a half years.Okay. I've written some words. I'm going to put a picture at the top. What would you like? A hippopotamus, you say? Sure, you can have a hippopotamus. That's do really well in the Google rankings.

{"title": "What is the best track on Orbital's green album?", "date": "Feb 28, 2022", "text": "Orbital's first album Orbital was called the Green Album because the cover was green. Actually, it was quite a yellow hue of green, but Quite A Yellow Hue Of Green was never going to catch on as a nickname.The album was released in 1991 and still holds up today. That said, this diamond is a little rough. Primitive production, percussion with all the grace of a sledgehammer, loops where you can easily see the join. I caught onto the Green Album a couple of years after its release, and even then I remember it sounding dated. In a charming way.Like a lime-liveried \"go\" light, the Green Album started something special. And not just because it had the stone-cold classics Chime and Belfast. Music production was about to advance at light speed. Along with their NME-recommended Brown Album two years later, the Green Album launched Orbital's transformation into stadium-filling techno gods, changing the face of techno album production.Okay. Serious talk over. Because I have to reduce things to lists or binary choices, it leads me to the question. Just what IS the best track on Orbital's Green Album? Let's have a bit of fun and rate each track according to how close it is on the colour wheel to its own cover colour, Quite A Yellow Hue Of Green. We'll be using the UK track listing.1. The MoebiusWe start off pretty strongly. This is a solid blue. Not bland Tory blue: it's Star Trek science officer blue thanks to its sample of a Next Generation episode. It's a metallic delight, all clanks and whirring machinery, part of that taken from the opening percussion in Mad World by Tears For Fears. Extra kudos for the mobius introducing a circular theme that would repeat during the band's career.2. Speed FreakSpeed Freak feels pretty far from yellowy green. I love the bassy bouncy orchestral stabs, and the splashy snares would return on The Brown Album. But the yelps and exclamatory interventions sound a little try-hard. The parpy theme that drops midway through is... okay. Speed Freak is a throbbing purple. No. Wait. There's the whole acid bit later on. It's a tastefully muted purple, almost fruity.3. OolaaOh crumbs. The great thing about Oola, apart from its intensity, is the rising acidic line that feels like a precursor to the ecstatic brass on Impact (The Earth Is Burning). Amid the enthusiastic synth washes in the tracks closing cacophony is a discordance that has always slightly bothered me. Therefore, this is not yellowy green. It is orange. A pleasing orange that would look good on a racing car or a cat. 4. Desert StormDesert Storm is the slow one. It writhes, it snakes, it plods along in a dubby way that isn't entirely unlike (a) the loping gait of the titular beasts in the 1970 film it samples, Beneath the Planet of the Apes, and (b) an Andrew Weatherall production. It feels less like an Orbital track than the rest of the album. The fact this was track-listed instead of Satan or Choice means this is pink. Not just pink. A blushing pink.5. Fahrenheit 303This track is somewhere between a burnt orange and a deep brown. Crumbs. There's not a lot of yellowy-green in this part of the album, is there. The jazzy keyboard riffs and knowing guiro scrapes are pure Jools Holland. Or Adamski on a bad day. Somewhere inbetween. The squiggly acid completely saves the day, as does the moody bass that closes out the track.6. Steel Cube IdolatryDave Angel did a cracking Mutations mix of this track. But we're not talking about that. Cube is clanky and clumsy in a really good way. The unsettling vowel utterations sound like a diva trying to escape from a drain. Ace. It all feels adjacent to found sound, which makes me fond of the whole thing. This is not far from green. A blue. A dark block blue, so not something you'd decorate your bathroom with.7. High RiseNow we're talking. This is another blue, but it's more than that. It's bluey-green. High Rise is often overlooked, but it's one of the few tracks on the Green Album that stops me in my tracks. It's Belfast-soft yet Steel Cube-hard. Nicely underplayed acid blurps, tickly synth scales, loops ratcheted into hypnotic repetition, and those rolling snares. PLUS a random key change. This is all the Orbital I need.8. Chime (Live)Although not the single version, this is their crossover hit. It got them onto Top of the Pops in 1990 and it's still in their live set today. Does it hold up? Of course it does. The electronic take on church bells. The suspended chord line. The flanging. The stuttering percussion. The cool-ass acid. Even the hand claps. Almost the yellowy-green of the album cover. Banana yellow. Lemon yellow. Very yellow.9. Midnight (Live)Yellowy-green! We're at yellowy-green! Even though Belfast is still to come, Midnight is the staggering highlight of Orbital's first album. Such omen. So potent. The minor chords and staccato hi-hats set a moody scene before we're plunged into a swirling, exotic world of deep, deep techno, all beautifully structured. Even the playful low-pass knob twiddling is great. A song I can play again and again.10. BelfastThere's not a lot to say about Belfast that hasn't already been said. It's beautiful and balaeric and most definitely a light shade of green. If Midnight is yellow-tinted, this is perhaps lime. Pretty dang close. Its clubby beach vibes and choral sampling are hugely hooked into the zeitgeist of the time: think Future Sound of London, Energy 52, The Beloved, Rhythim Is Rhythim, even Enigma.11. \"I Think It's Disgusting\" (Outro)This is just a run-off track, so not worth rating despite this loopy coda idea being emulated in many smokers' beats albums later in the decade. Okay. It's red. This is a red track. And a lovely red it is too.So there you have it. Orbital's first album rendered into colours with the quality of content rendered as proximity to the album's cover art. Bet you never expected to be reading something like that today, did you.In summary:Further Fats: Some lists containing rhyming Autechre, Orbital in colour, and the entire history of dance music (2009)Further Fats: A rainbow of Aphex Twins (2021)"},
{"title": "A finger of Fudge is not enough", "date": "Feb 17, 2022", "text": "I felt a bit unsettled the other day. Something at the back of my mind, niggling me like an annoying puppy or a ghost. I get these moments more frequently as I get older, and I have to stop to assess my general state before continuing with my day.I realised I was fretting over whether a finger of Fudge really was just enough to treat a child, or whether or was just a bit stingy, what with increasingly affordable modern gadgets available on the high street.You know how the advert goes, right? If you're reading a Blogger blog, you're totally old enough to remember the song in the Cadbury's Fudge commercial. Supposedly, a finger of Fudge is \"just enough until it's time to eat\", which is essentially advocating chocolate dessert before the meal.And do you know what? I'm in favour. It's a long time since I've fingered a buffet, but I love going to an All You Can Eat place and alternating between sweet and savoury. I reject John Shuttleworth's philosophy in I Can’t Go Back to Savoury Now that you can't return to a shepherd's pie once you're halfway through a treacle sponge. Mix and match. Use the same spoon for both.The Fudge song describes the chocolate bars as \"very small and neat\", which is true. They are incredibly small, which brings me back to my main concern that they're too small. Not quite enough to give anyone a treat. You'd have to follow it up with a Boost or a Toblerone or an entire chocolate egg. Sorry, did I type \"or\"? I meant to say \"and\".So anyway, that's what's been bothering me recently. The miserable months of January and February are definitely getting to me. The highlight of the past few months was when I ate Mentos and drank Diet Coke and didn't explode. Harrumph. What an insufferable drudge. Why can't we have six Augusts?I need a new project. Maybe I should watch some Cadbury's adverts to get some ideas. I could become a drumming gorilla. Shove a flake in my mouth dead sexy-like. Perhaps I should become a Milk Tray man, parkouring over wheelie bins without dropping a single Hazelnut Swirl.Jeez. Next time I get a niggle in the back of my mind, I won't stop to think about it. Did I want to be writing about Fudges? No, I did not.

Meanwhile, in my column I take on cancel culture while my fictional self blows a horn. All pretty normal, nothing to worry about here.The Bonobo review is the lead review in this latest edition, which is always a nice spot to be in as a writer. You'll have to read the magazine to find out what I think, but I can tell you it contains the phrase \"frozen fish aisle\". I also review the latest album by Pan Daijing (\"a forest of startled birds\") and Arca's new clutch of albums (\"witches and queerness\").This month's column has me getting outraged about cancel culture. \"Are you telling me I can’t prance around as glam-rock Brian Eno, complete with unbuttoned motorbike jacket and feather shoulder-pads, while hooting Van McCoy's ‘The Hustle’ on the alpine horn?\" And yes, that ended up being my illustration for the column, with added conkers for eyes.

{"title": "You wait for one Better Days and two arrive at once ", "date": "Jan 19, 2022", "text": "I was tottering along the street a while ago when a black cat appeared from under a hedge to say hello. I always stop to fuss cats. They're cute and fun, and you never know if one will suddenly start talking French or lead you to an abandoned whelk mine.The moment I stroked this friendly black cat, another black cat appeared. Same hedge, same appearance. I suddenly had two black cats greeting me. It was like being in The Matrix except without the pill popping and questionable spoons. Apart from the brief concern that I had developed a special power that duplicates whatever I stroke, a talent that could get very problematic very quickly, I handled the situation fine. Two very similar cats. Two very similar hands. The maths worked out: double petting commenced. Why am I telling you this? Because at the moment there are two songs in the UK singles chart called Better Days. This concerns me, because singles are less cute than cats and I don't like having two of them. One of the Better Days is by Neiked, Mae Muller and Polo G. It's a sunny slice of Tik Tok-famous retro pop in which US rapper Polo G asks \"can I get an amen\" so politely, it sounds like he's ordering afternoon tea. The other Better Days is a yearning torch song by Irish singer Dermot Kennedy. In the video, he falls into a puddle and stays there for a bit. It's pretty wet physically and musically, but Snow Patrol fans will like it. Two Better Days in one chart? I thought this wasn't allowed. I thought you had to give songs different nicknames so you could tell them apart, in the same way we all have friends called Big Tony, French Tony, Naked Tony and Seven Years In Strangeways Tony. I thought songwriters had these things allocated to them, making them queue with a numbered ticket as if they were waiting for fancy cheese.In the past, duplicated track titles were easily navigated. Adele and Lionel Richie both had a Hello, but the songs were decades apart and Adele didn't have a bonce made out of clay. Orbital and Boney M both had tracks called Belfast. Neither are likely to get confused, unless the Orbital brothers suddenly start coming up with disco dance moves. Mariah Carey and Big Bird both had different songs called All I Want for Christmas Is You, but only one of them was about a snuffleupagus. It gets more difficult the closer the songs get. In the mid-1980s, there were two number one ballads called The Power of Love courtesy of Jennifer Rush and Frankie Goes To Hollywood. Close in time, close in style. Meanwhile, Robert Plant, World Party and Erasure all had different hits called Ship Of Fools within 20 months of each other. It's such a colourful metaphor that, in my mind, all three songs have muddled into one vague image of a bunch of clowns on a pirate ship doing karaoke.Whitesnake and Alison Moyet both had mid-1980s songs titled Is This Love. Go and look at the videos for the songs. Moyet and David Coverdale sport the exact same shaggy dog hairstyle. It's ridiculous. There have been 20 hit singles called Stay. It's such a bland track name, I could sing you the Shakespears Sister one but absolutely none of the others, despite the rest of the list featuring big hitters like Rihanna, Mica Paris and Simply flipping Red. Not helpful.I demand that each Better Days song changes its name. The first one, the Tik Tok one, should be called Afternoon Tea. And the other one, the wet one, should be called Oh Look I'm In A Puddle, While I Think About It Whatever Happened To Snow Patrol. That should sort it. Who do I contact about this? Is it the Queen? Paul Gambaccini? Greg James?!The other solution is to enact a new law in which every song is called Song. Every song ever written. All of them called Song. Hey, I've written a new track. Brilliant, what's it called? Song. That's great, what's it about? Stuff. Sounds wonderful, here's a Grammy.I wonder if the existence of two Better Days is a Matrix glitch caused by the appearance of two similar cats. I'd ask Keanu Reeves if this is possible, but he's done four films with the word 'Matrix' in, so I'm not going to take his advice on anything. There is no spoon? I've got loads of spoons, mate, all of them identical.Further Fats: No-one wants songs about the moon these days (2017)Further Fats: A little cat story (it's the story that's little, not the cat) (2018)"},

You enter letters and the puzzle tells you how close you are to the correct ones. It has words like QUERY and DADDY and FARTS.

That's it. Decision made. Even Bleep agree with me. Please write this in your books because the decision cannot be changed.Who am I kidding. My annual number one list over the years is full of albums that I wouldn't make number one now. Why didn't I make Luke Abbott number one in 2010? Or Kiasmos the best album of 2014? I'm such a little fickle douche.Anyhoo. Let's double down. This is definitely the number one bestest long-player of the year, and if you disagree with me, you are a poopy poop-head.Listening back to Lewis 'Koreless' Roberts's older releases is revealing. 2011's 4D is rooted in bass music, but the 'woooah' vocals are somewhat post-dubstep, and try so hard to be Hyph Mngo. It doesn't entirely work. What's curious about that is that vocals are such a central part of Agor.Here's a moodboard for the first two tracks on Agor. An electrical burst. A splash of static. Lilting ambience. Images of the sea on a sunny day. Frequencies tighten and suddenly the synth is a rhythm. My tongue waters. I imagine clouds sweeping the sky above me. A honky siren kicks me in the face. I lose my balance. The sweeping ambience darkens. A fog lifts me into the air. I can see nothing but I know I'm weightless. The noise drops out guillotine-quick. I fall flat on my face into a dumpster.THANKS for that, Koreless. Later on, on White Picket Fence, come the voices. A harpsichord-soft melody accompanies a crystalline chorister. I'm briefly confused. The choral voice fractals into scattered samples, echoing with the ever-more shining ambience. I momentarily forget how to breathe.And so it goes. Loud, quiet. Chorister, ambience. Bursting dynamics, resonant silence. A stuttering vowel takes the place of a synth on Joy Squad, and suddenly we're in a beatless rave at the end of the universe. Shellshock is as close as the second half of the album comes to a straight house rhythm, complete with crowd-teasing EDM-style drops – and there isn't a drum in earshot.We've been edging towards this kind of drum-free trance-ish classic for some time. Lorenzo Senni comes to mind, as does Nathan Micay. I think you have to get used to the vocals – it's all a bit Kyrie Eleison / liturgical at times. But embrace that and you have the most stunning album of 2021. As Bleep's far superior write up says, \"Forget cinematic — this is the sound of waking up on an alien planet and coming to terms with an entirely different ecosystem.\"So there we go. A Bangor beatmaker turned Glasgow producer pops out a debut album of shiny techno, and quite rightly has been bigged up by Caribou and Jamie xx. It's remarkable audio feat after remarkable audio feat: incredible to hear an experiment in sound design that is so entertaining. Quite rightly, it's a the top of my pile of 90 albums.Thank you for reading my blog gubbins in 2021. It has been a less bloggy year than usual, but that's okay. I've been busy building a lifesize blue-tac sculpture of H from Steps or building a lifesize sculpture of Ronan Keating using only cardboard, sellotape and dozen dead octopuses or building a lifesize model of the universe from Plumber's Mait putty.

We've spent the best part of two years not clubbing much, so it has been a pleasure to mainline Tread into my stupid brain. Boogie in the discotheque of my imagination. Felix Clary Weatherall built his own Ableton plug-in for the album to allow for a freer form of recording. The result is a work that sounds truly live.Highlight follows highlight. The Daisy's trippy IDM is a waterfall of tumbling sadness. Love Divide takes a more straight Bonobo route, while filtering power pop vocals into passing fractals. The slow hip hop beats of Spatter/Splatter background what sounds like a choir prepping for war. Run is pure 80s pop chewed up and spat out by Boards of Canada. Life In A Mind is a microphone-brandishing diva riding a sonic spaceship like a skateboard.For me, Revellers is the crowning glory, but that accolade will be different for everyone. I recommended this track on my Twitter a month ago because, and I quote, \"I just put it on, instinctively made a furrowed 'tuuuune' face, and whacked the volume right up.\" Actually, maybe XXX Olympiad is my fave: those skippy drums land so nicely.Ross from Friends walk into a room and says sadly, \"hey, let's talk about dinosaurs\". Get lost, Ross from Friends. We've already got a Ross From Friends. He's a keeper.*I am aware that I'm criticising lazy writing while making the hackest route-one reference I could think of when talking about the music artist Ross From Friends.

The story goes that King Arthur removed a stone in his shoe. He chucked it towards Swansea, and by the time it had reached Swansea Bay, it was massive enough to be photographed for a µ-Ziq album cover.I like to think of the idea of this album starting as a stone in Paradinas's mind. Given the extra time of lockdown, it grew into something substantial and, I'd argue, one of his best albums to date. In fact, I'd go as far to say if this was µ-Ziq's debut album, it would be up there with Selected Ambient Works. Every track is a banger wrapped in gauze and left to ride the thermals of the south Wales coastline.The moral of the story is:Always holiday in Wales because you might end up producing an album.Be careful of where you throw stones because they can suddenly become massive.Wear sensible shoes.

Read it all here.[AF038LP] Scurlage by µ-ZiqFat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents another brilliant album:LoneLady – Former Things (Warp)I'm a Mancunian. Born in Manchester, raised in Manchester, still in Manchester. I'm possibly the least travelled person in the country. What this has given me is a strong identification with my city, and when the Madchester scene exploded all around me, I was a happy baggy lad indeed.What I've connected less with is pre-rave Manchester. All the post punk stuff. And when people talk about LoneLady, they're likely to mention this more gothic past: Joy Division and crumbling mills and downtrodden guitar misery, things I've neuralysed from my memory Men In Black-style, with a sharp flash of glow-stick.So when Julie Campbell brought the synths to the fore for Former Things, she caught my attention as never before. Opening single (There Is) No Logic was a body-popping, head-bouncing, spleen-jiving delight. The keyboards weren't just foregrounded: they were being dropped on your head from the top of multi-storey car parks. I was instantly hooked. What followed lived up to the hype, from the hesitant The Catcher to the downbeat closer Terminal Ground.In Electronic Sound (yes, that again), I lauded the \"feather-light strumming and electronic orchestral plucks\" and the evocation of \"Kraftwerk’s ‘Home Computer’ stricken by a blue screen\" and the \"feeling of doubt, of paranoia, of uncertainty, albeit threaded with memorable hooks: all the things that make for truly landmark pop music.\"The unsettled nature of her previous albums, as skittery as someone walking the backstreets of East Manchester on purge night, is carried through into this album. Although this time there are touchstones of everything from Juan Atkins to Cabaret Voltaire to Bananarama. Techno punky synthpop. Punk poppy technosynth.Look into this glow stick. Deep into this glow stick. You will give this album a spin. Repeat after me. You will give this album a spin. There, that should do it.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.Former Things by LoneLadyFat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents another brilliant album:Lone – Always Inside Your Head (Greco-Roman)Here, Lone, take a seat. Sit on the sofa, I'll take the futon. Are you comfortable? Have a cigar. You want to watch Netflix? Take an emery board, get those nails nice and neat. Put your feet up on the cat, that's fine. Help yourself to anything in the fridge. Yes, you can snuggle up to my Henry hoover. You make yourself at home.He might as well move in. Lone has trudged around this part of my blog more often than me. In 2009, Ecstasy And Friends made my top ten end-of-year list then promptly blew my speakers. In 2012, he was my joint favourite album of the year. I called Galaxy Garden \"in-your-face gorgeous.\" I say \"gorgeous\" a lot. For his album Reality Testing, my fourth favourite album of 2014, I raved about a \"same kind of melancholia Brian Eno once gave earnest rock bands: a new tone for Lone.\" In 2016, I called Levitate a \"junglist hymn to Good Looking Records and Goldie\". Lone is back in my top ten list, back home where he belongs. In preparation for this album, he's been posting 'mood board' photographs on his social media. A fuzzy telly pic of Goldie. Old pics of what I think are Fluke and the Sneaker Pimps perhaps. But it's My Bloody Valentine and the Cocteau Twins that provide the main influence for this eighth album.This is a hazy Lone. Clouds of heavenly vocals settle over floating streams of warm ambience. Slow trip hop rhythms amble care-free as lazy synth lines eddy and swirl. And it's oh-so-1990s, with flecks of happy trance and liquid drum and bass. I can even spot that new age flute sample so beloved of Enigma back in the day. Is that a Higher Intelligence Agency bleep sample? It feels very similar. Ah, this puts me in a good place.Perhaps the centrepiece of Always Inside My Head is Akoya, a glowing puddle of ambient shoegaze smoked over with the angelic vocals of Morgane Diet – the album's best evocation of the extraordinarily personal and deep new Lone we find ourselves faced with. So soft, and yet so substantial.No, you may not use the toilet. You can do it in the garden shed like all my other visitors. I like having you around, Lone, but limits are limits. Pssscht.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.Always Inside Your Head by LoneFat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents another brilliant album:GCOM – E2-XO (!K7 Records) This is Global Communication. Y'know. The ones who did 76:14. No, you're not taking this seriously. Listen to what I'm saying. This is Tom Middleton's solo relaunch of the greatest ambient project of modern times. You're not listening. This is big. This is seriously big. The GC bit stands for Global Communication. Are you hearing how massive this is? Hey! No, come back. Stop running. TALK TO ME. STOP RUNN--Ahem. Sorry for bothering you. As with previous instalments in this best-of list, I had a chance here to revisit my review of this album for Electronic Sound magazine. The review, published a month or two ago, contains the following sentences:\"A Martian space whale mounts the International Space Station.\"\"A manatee from Jupiter swallows Elon Musk whole.\"The review also contains some sensible bits, such as: \"Opener Noctis Ultimus is Max Richter orbiting Saturn, stratospherically enriched by the swooning cello of Susie Blankfield. It leads us into the vacuum-packed intensity of XO Transmission #1, written with the late French IDM producer Thomas Denis. With its jagged asteroid belts of sharp, outlandish rhythms, the pairing feels like Westeros invaded by Autechre...\"So that should give you an idea of the tone of this Global Communication reboot. It spans the universes of modern classical and electronic composition with aplomb.I referred to this in the magazine as \"a sister planet to 76:14\". I can come up with no greater compliment. A real treat of lockdown was to receive their impressive box set Transmissions, but this truly tops it. This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.E2-XO by GCOM Fat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents another brilliant album:Eris Drew – Quivering In Time (T4T LUV NRG)Let's start this review by widening things out a little – in a rather unexpected direction. The KLF's gonna rock ya.In 2017, Eris Drew revealed her belief in a healing goddess power she called The Motherbeat. She did this in a YouTube video which pinpointed her revelation as coming \"23 years after the fire\". Which fire? Stay with me...In the same year, 2017, writer Daisy Eris Campbell directed the KLF's art show comeback. The KLF's big return was massive news for us electronic music heads. And what the KLF lads do 23 years previously? They burnt a million quid, to the shock of tabloid naysayers everywhere. One of the most famous pop music fires after Jacko's Pepsi hair shocker.So in 2017, Eris revealed the Motherbeat and another Eris helped the KLF return to the art world, both of which happened \"23 years after the fire\". 23 is also a number associated with Eris, the goddess worshipped in the satirical religion of Discordianism. The KLF built their situationist publicity mongering around the world of Eris the goddess – it's where \"The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu\" comes from. Erises everywhere!Phew. Let's get back to the most important Eris, namely the one who here presents her debut album on the label she runs with partner Octo Octa, also an amazing producer. Quivering In Time is brilliant. Recorded in rural New Hampshire, there's a joyful spirituality here that expresses itself as pure dancefloor mayhem. Poppy house beats! Rolling breaks and perky melodies! A rogue clavichord! 90s vocal interjections! If Eris Drew was hoping to channel the wild spirit of the KLF in her work, it's here in spades. The Loaded-sampling The Message / Ride Free is pure pop, the shimmering vibes on Quivering In Time is straight from Trancentral, and Pick 'Em Up's melody is as direct as any horned mu-mu chant.It's just so damn fun. The Motherbeat is pumping loud and clear.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021.

Thankfully, the only backwards thing on this forward-thinking techno is his reverse-cameo name.Ian 'Eomac' McDonnell had produced his previous two albums in Berlin, a busy city which hosts (checks the internet) the longest open-air gallery in the world, 200.000 pet dogs and Europe's most visited zoo. For this new album, he moved to rural Ireland where they have (checks the internet) an obelisk and an old friary.This lovely beaty techno on this Lakker chap’s third album is dour stuff. The Akala-sampling Mandate For Murder has all the grumpy righteousness of a Twitter account. The spiralling chords on What Does Your Heart Tell You? sounds like an IDM tuned sandpapered over and over again. Reasons To Live has a whistle melody that's as chirpy as a chimberly sweep trapped in a sewer.It's gorgeous, it's dirty, it's scratchy and strobing and Shamen-ic, and the best album that came out of a reliably excellent Planet Mu Records in 2021.That Akala sample, by the way? It was from a comment in which rapper Akala responded to a newspaper column by a racist, who shall remain unnamed here. He said: \"When you refer to humans as cockroaches, that is a mandate for murder.\" A timely reminder that this annual countdown is a celebration of music that brings people together, a very human unity through music that is needed more than ever. This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.Cracks by EomacFat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents another brilliant album:Ebende – Skimmer (All My Thoughts)This top ten list is in alphabetical order by artist, but I'm not gonna lie: this very nearly was my number one album of 2021.Every track on this Gothenburg artist's debut album has its Thing. Do you know what I mean by that? When people have their 'thing', it's the one trait they're known for. For example, Granny never steps on paving slab cracks, and she's the same with patterned carpets. Uncle Kenny wears those red hats, even indoors. Michelle at the newsagents wears those baggy anime t-shirts with crocs. You have that constant odour of old ham. Your Thing. You have your Thing. Each Skimmer track has a Thing. The plummeting choir notes on Shift. The woodpecker percussion on Warmth. The absolute banger For Love, its broken rave hitting so hard. The wobble-board synth effects on Soothing. The tinkling reverb on What I Come From. The disembodied choir on Ba Chill. The garage sparkiness of Nostalgia. The circling breakbeats that make Get Lost so addictive. And the title track's long ascent into something quite heavenly – just wait for those smoky chords to land.Apparently, Ebende owes a lot to his multi-instrumentalist father. I wonder what his 'thing' was. He couldn't pronounce scissors? Eight fingers on his left hand? Had got to the age of 47 without ever using a phone? Always kept eggs in the shoe cupboard? Entirely made of corrugated iron? Everyone's got their Thing.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.Skimmer by EbendeFat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents another brilliant album:Bicep – Isles (Ninja Tune)It's time for my top ten countdown of the bestest best electronic music albums of 2021. Apart from the number one album, the top ten will be in alphabetical order by artist. Let's start with B for Bicep.Respected author of the uncanny Nicholas Royle has a problem with this Belfast DJing duo's name. Back in 2017, I posted a link to one of their videos, commenting \"it'll cheer your weekend up good and proper\". Royle, who writes and edits books so knows how to do words good, said he was uncheered by the fact the band should know the word is \"biceps\" not \"bicep\". You can't have one bicep.What followed was a light-hearted exchange in which Bicep, the band, jokingly promised Royle that they would address their dictionary-unfriendly name in the liner notes of their second album. Extra points to the author for his \"Good strong response, Bicep\" quip. Biceps? Strong? Ah suit yerself.Here we are in December 2021, and Bicep have released their second album Isles. What does it contain? Drizzles of melancholic electronica, punchy beats filed to within an inch of their life, ear-popping vocal samples, and a nostalgic trip through every sheeny techno beat that's ever been created. Its a Bonobo fixed up and looking even sharper. A tribute to the unity of club culture, full of portent and scrumptious chords.What's noticeably absent is a written explanation to Mr Royle, in full legalese, about their improbable name. Perhaps we'll never know what a bicep is. I admit, this did all happen more than four years ago: I put it down to bad muscle memory. This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.Isles by Bicep"},

His last work Hollow Earth was one of my 2019 highlights, with me proclaiming that it deserved \"its own police hat\". I must have been drunk. This is dramatic analogue techno encased in marshmallows. Imagine a spaceship gliding through space, but it has no edges. It just seems to absorb everything that's around it. And this is the genius of Jenkins: he makes something ethereal and gossamer floaty sound so dang weighty. Please don't go back and read that old blog post: I bang on about arresting aliens or something. Honestly. As drunk as a pig in absinthe.Ruth Mascelli – A Night At The Baths (Disciples)Normally a synth wielder for New Orleans punkers Special Interest, Mascelli steps out into the hot night for an assortment of buzzing club techno custom made for that 4am pill-fuelled dance slog. Ruth says they got their inspiration from \"bathhouses, dark rooms and gay clubs\", and you can certainly feel the sweat pouring off the subterranean basslines and deep, deep drums. Ruth also talks about \"cavernous sex clubs\". Indeed, a Bandcamp reviewer writes \"My bf has f*cked me to this album at least 5 times this weekend\". Goodness me, you'll spill your Babycham, mate. Techno for punks. Sexy punks.Ryan James Ford – Exshaw (DUB Recordings) Ryan James's debut named after his Canadian childhood home, or more specifically the forests that surrounded his home. I don't know what you get in Canadian woodland. Badgers? Elk? Polar bears on scooters? Probably all three. He has a tasty way of juggling breakbeats against a background of gloriously pitched ambience: imagine Aphex Twin's On remixed for a rave, with added club thuddery that grows growlier and more dominant throughout the album. Very good indeed. I was right about the woodland animals, by the way. The ominous Avant Guaze has a sound akin to a polar bear trying to nuzzle into a backpacker's soup flask. You'll never get it home on that scooter, mate.Skee Mask – Pool (Ilian Tape)2018's Compro was a corker, likened on this blog to that \"little glint in a hippo’s eye when it wears its first tutu\". What? This is not so much a dancing hippo as a step aerobics class by a bunch of miniature warthogs, each one dressed like its favourite soap opera star. There's not much to tie it all together, but you like the variety and weirdness of it all, and you don't doubt the energy everyone's putting in. Five, six, seven, oink! Pool takes in everything from pounding club bangers to squirrelly experimentalism, barely resting along the way. Squirrels? Where did they come from?This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.A Night At The Baths by Ruth MascelliITLP09 - Pool by Skee MaskFat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents four more brilliant albums:µ-Ziq and Mrs Jynx – Secret Garden (Planet Mu) Melodic IDM of the highest order. Please insert a smiley face emoji here. Inspired by the death of their parents. Please replace the smiley face emoji with a sad cry emoji. Gorgeous bubbly acid, feather-light electronic rhythms, hammock-lazy melody lines, glistening synth perfection, AND tracks called The Ballad Of Darth Vader and Philip Steak. Please cross out all existing emojis, replacing them with a crazy eyed emoji listening really hard to tiny headphones. This collaboration between an IDM legend – head of the Planet Mu label, no less – and a fully respected Manchester music maker paid off in buckets. All the happy faces.Posthuman – Requiem For A Rave (Balkan Vinyl)I don't often quote PR blurbs, but get a load of this. \"We’re of the generation that saw the Criminal Justice Bill force the raves from the fields into the clubs, we caught the tail end of the convoys soundtracked by cassette recordings of pirate radio stations from far-off London and beyond. Every week a new musical discovery, every mixtape a revelation.\" From the rude boy shoutouts, to the choppy synth lines, to the car-speaker busting bass, this glow-stick guzzling dancefloor workout does what it says on the tin. Throwback? No way. This is a fast-forward because the spirit of rave lives on hard with Requiem.Proc Fiskal – Siren Spine Sysex (Hyperdub)Apparently, Proc Fiskal's family was big in folk music. Not, like, giants. They didn't have to use massive guitars or anything. But, like, there's a real heritage there. It's an interesting historical note because of the use of vocal samples in this super-glazed second album of tingling and detailed electronica. It rather sounds like he's grabbed an acapella folk band and spiralised them all over his music. Or maybe just meat-minced a carolling choir. In a gorgeous way. \"Like Elizabeth Fraser cut into a UK Garage lilt,\" says the blurb. The result is enchanting: never has Gaelic sounded so futuristic.Proswell – People are Giving and Receiving Thanks at Incredible Speeds (Central Processing Unit)A veteran Chicago producer and format experimentalist nails his first album for Sheffield's CPU Records. Am I going to cut and paste from one of my Electronic Sound reviews again? Of course I can. I'm writing everything at breakneck speed in an attempt to keep ahead of my blogging schedule. So... This album \"throws us into an imaginary computer game where the pixels are broken and the only glow in the distance is a low-battery light.\" This is Rephlexian IDM on happy pills. And it must get a bonus point for one of the best album ack titles of the year. \"Game over,\" I wrote. \"Play again? Most definitely yes.\"This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.Secret Garden by µ-Ziq & Mrs JynxRequiem For A Rave by PosthumanFat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents four more brilliant albums:Jim Noir – Deep Blue View (Dook Recordings) This was a massive surprise. Not in a horse's head in your shopping trolley kind of way. More like a unicorn in your wardrobe kind of way. Is that better? Not sure. Anyways, in Electronic Sound, I described Noir's ludicrously listenable music as \"a full-on hug... a Jim Noir boudoir. Think Air covering the Beatles via John Barry.\" Honestly, this is possibly the most pleasant work on this best-of countdown. Ah, I've thought of a better simile. It's like ripping open your pillow then finding another pillow inside then ripping open that pillow and finding pillows carrying on until the end of the universe. Whilst sleeping with a unicorn. Delightful.Joy Orbison – still slipping vol. 1 (XL Recordings)You wait ages for a Joy Orbison debut album and suddenly one comes along at once. Look, it's not like you need to release an album to make a name for yourself. Orbison is electronic music royalty. However, it's astonishing to think that his game-changing debut track Hyph Mngo was released in the decade before last, and it's only now that he's chosen to pop out a long-player. It was a curiously low-key mix-tape-style debut, his floaty club cuts peppered with the voice of family members distanced from him during lockdown. Still, although there wasn't much to get your teeth into, it was extraordinarily listenableLNS & DJ Sotofett – Sputters (Tresor Records)What do you get if you cross a Canadian producer and a Norwegian DJ? Great big holes all over Australia! Wait. That's not right. This is the first time these collaborators have produced an album, and the fact it's on the hard-nosed Tresor Records gives a clue as to its content. Hammer-blow bass drums lead the energy, bringing with them twitchy 909 rhythms, abraded acid and lots of science fiction sounds. The best thing is the album's dubwise attitude, with the echo machine working overtime to plump the cold hardware with warm air. Dubby electro fun and no mistake.Murcof – The Alias Sessions (The Leaf Label) Another album that probably should have been in my top ten. This abstract minimalism was originally written for a dance performance, and sees Murcof reuniting with the legendary Leaf label for the first time in 13 years. \"Murcof creates cataclysmic ripples from the smallest waveform, like a moth’s wingbeat causing Saturn to explode,\" I wrote in Electronic Sound before waffling about \"gaseous glitches\" and \"transient arcs\" and an \"ominous gong, rusted piano over supercharged static\". For an act so obtuse to mainstream ears, it's incredible how listenable this is. Arguably Murcof's best work for a long time.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.Deep Blue View by Jim NoirSputters by LNS & DJ SotofettFat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents four more brilliant albums:Blanck Mass – In Ferneaux (Sacred Bones Records)When the Guardian reviewed this, they called it \"the very definition of niche\". I think that's code for \"we don't quite get it\". This is certainly Benjamin John Power doing something different, as he swaps his flesh-wobbling red-LED maximalism for something more serene. In two long phases, he leads us through sparkling streams of polished pads, through tinkling found sounds, through droning funereal organs, Scanner-style vocal wires. There are relatively few moments – although they are still there – where it feels like he is battering mechanical moles into your brain. Sounds niche. And I approve.Facta – Blush (Wisdom Teeth) How did this drop out of my top ten? For flip's sake. Can someone get admin on the line? Here's a snippet from my review of this folky debut for Electronic Sound magazine. \"Facta’s insanely good-natured debut is a woodland meander through placid pads and feet-tickling FM synths... On Deck’s cheery vibraphone recalls 808 State’s rosier moments, or last year’s triumphantly tropical Cape Cira from label partner K-Lone [see 2020's countdown].\" Speaking of K-Lone, it does work as a sister album: this Balearic delight is another gleaming triumph for the Wisdom Teeth label. Well done, teeth fairies!Hannah Peel – Fir Wave (My Own Pleasure)Hannah Peel is well jammy. For this fourth album, she was given access to the Delia Derbyshire archives. She rebuilt that historic audio into a haunting Mercury Prize-shortlisted tribute to library music and nocturnal chill-out. Cycles of fuzzy synths pay homage to the likes of Global Communication, and the thrilling build on Ecovocative is pure Ulrich Schnauss. All the while, this is uniquely Peel, and you can easily draw a line of heritage to her ace spacy album Mary Casio. I presume she got permission for the Delia samples, and didn't break into the archive like the Pink Panther, the Oceans Eleven fellas or an especially naughty badger.Herrmann Kristoffersen – Gone Gold (Bytes)Over to my Electronic Sound writing again for this tribute to the classic Electronic Arts video game Need For Speed. (Yes, really. Apparently the Kristoffersen half of the partnership used to compose music for Nintendo.) \"Unsurprisingly for something released on Bytes, named after the legendary Black Dog album, there’s more than a hint of Artificial Intelligence here. The nostalgia works: cue a montage of Playstations, Gameboys and blocky Designers Republic geometrics... There is widescreen emotion on Gone Gold, its wistful IDM washes as filmic as any modern cutscene.\" Vroom, vroom.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.Blush by FactaFir Wave by Hannah PeelThe Top 60 becomes a Top 30. The excitement! Fat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents four more brilliant albums:96 Back – 9696 Dream (Local Action)Sheffield's Evan Majumdar-Swift has turned in a corker of a rave album, and there's barely a phat drop in sight. This is techno written in neon and hydrogen. Lines of melody have all the woozy weightlessness of waking from sleep, and even when it slaloms into a steady groove on, say, Freepass For Them, it still feels light on its feet. Incidentally, this was mastered by Warp Records founder Rob Gordon, so there's some serious heft behind the buoyancy. Hat doff to his other works this year, including the move into vocals on the compelling Love Letters, Nine Through Six.Anz – All Hours (Ninja Tune)Another EP has sneaked its way onto my list. Whaddaya gonna do? Report me to the list police? This unashamedly poppy collection of bass music feels like that moment in a movie when all is resolved and the protagonists just need to let their hair down. Stereo on, disco ball spinning, and let's not think too much about granny whose storyline was left unsolved. Did she escape the kidnappers? Who cares. Let's boogie to the glistening r&b, the funky electro jams, the gentle acid, the shuffling wub-wub techno. This is a Ninja Tune debut for this Manchester producer: the world is watching. Maybe granny was one of the bad guys. We'll find out in the sequel. Roll credits!Basic Rhythm – Electronic Labyrinth (Planet Mu)I've been watching East Man's output with interest, so it's pleasing to see Anthoney Hart's other alter-ego drop such a compelling album. As suggested by the East London landscape of the album cover, his second album under this name for Planet Mu, this is tower-block tough. Hunch-shouldered rhythms provide a base for a series of tributes to his pirate DJ days on Rude FM. Beats crumble, basslines bend, and euphoric rave lines are subsumed into the grittiness of it all. Hayward Road soars the highest, but its freewheeling arpeggio belies the fact that we barely leave the basement of modern UK bass music. Proper.The Black Dog – Music For Photographers (Dust Science)Brutal. No, literally. Dusty legends The Black Dog spent two years photographing Brutalist architecture, and this compendium of deep, hazy ambience has an intention as cemented as the structures that inspired it. \"It should be played in full when visiting any location,\" say the Dogsters. So whip out their Brutal Sheffield book, Google Map your way to one of the buildings, and let this album consume you in situ. Chords are elongated, beats are reigned in, and bulldozers put on hold as we celebrate a quickly disappearing aspect of UK cities.

{"title": "Best electronic music albums 2021: an update", "date": "Dec 30, 2021", "text": "Hello, reader. We are halfway through my blogging marathon of my bestest toppest electronic music albums of 2021.Of my original 90 albums on my list, 60 have come and gone. Jon Hopkins went off to live in a cave, Caro C got her rocks on, Ulrich Schnauss was a \"neon pink hallucination\" and Jana Rush inadvertently made me reveal something disturbing about me and a science lab.I expect you to have listened to all 60 of those albums by now. There will be a written exam on the way out.What's next? I'll now get into the top 30 best electronic albums of 2021. As explained in my introductory blog post, albums will continue to be grouped together rather than have specific chart numbers assigned. I'll do a bunch of Top 30s, then a bunch of Top 10s - and then the all-important number one Best Electronic Album of 2021.Can you cope with the pressure? Here, breathe into this paper bag. Here, have a good squeeze of this stress ball. Here, stroke this fluffy kitten. Here, put your finger into this tube marked 'Instant Shock Device 69.0'. Aaaaand relax.More albums to come. I might do some more tonight, or I might wait until tomorrow. I dunno. I've been writing since 8am and I'm a bit tired. In any case, you can follow all of this on the 'best albums of 2021' label on this blog. Treat!Fat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents five more brilliant albums:SectorSept – 954 (Gobstopper Records)Pssst, mate. Don't tell anyone, but technically this is an EP. It shouldn't be on the list. If you tell anyone, I'll slice ya. Anyhoo, Mr. Mitch's Gobstopper label presents this delicious techno, er, album from this UK / Florida producer. The low-slung beats cast a line between UK bass music and smooth US electro, its low-res vocal samples only adding to the urban atmosphere. Not an artist I've encountered before, so I'll be watching keenly for future releases. A real head-nodder. Say nuthin', alright? Nudge nudge, wink wink, flap flap.Steven Rutter – Riddle Me Sane (FireScope Records) Steven who? This is the bloke from legendary Artificial Intelligence act B12. The best thing? He's pretty much doing his B12 thing. Which is all kinds of fantastic. Electronic bloops, skippy snares. dubby bass, gorgeous early Warp vibes. There's a bleepy bit towards the start of the album which I want to either woo into marriage or take on a horrendously dirty weekend away. A melodic treat where, in the vein of classic ambient dub of the Warp variety, the machines truly feel alive.Stigma – Too Long (Pessimist Productions)A marching band staggers around the corner. They pound their drums but they're smashed on illegal grog. They stagger into bins, trip over kerbs. The guy at the back, the one with the cymbals, has been mounted by a squid. Welcome to the world of Stigma, the new name for Kristian 'Pessimist' Jabs. Big fat trip hop beats crumble into a pool of post-Massive Attack misery while wiggly bits of electronica splash around at the edges. This damn funk is sliced through with the spirit of Bristol. What a triumph.Tristan Arp – Sculpturegardening (Wisdom Teeth)Arp, who counts Arca as a former classmate, created this lilting electronic album during lockdown in Mexico City, a time when many of us were solo-journeying into nature. Sculpturegardening was inspired by Alan Titchmarsh. Oh, hold on. Not Alan specifically. It was inspired by gardening generally, and has a natural, dappled feel thanks to its wavering harmonics and soft cello sounds. Considering the generative processes he used, the result is remarkably pretty. An album for stopping and smelling the Alans. Roses, I mean. Smelling the roses.Ulrich Schnauss & Mark Peters – Destiny Waiving (Bureau B) \"I’ve never been massaged by puppies on a bed of candy floss,\" I wrote in Electronic Sound magazine, \"but these serene sounds probably come close.\" I praised the album's \"neon pink hallucination of bright open guitar chords and chains of blissful harmonics\" before having second thoughts about my opening image. \"Maybe not puppies. Kittens, perhaps. Really fluffy ones.\" Oh dear. Anyhow, this is all jolly and cheerful because it's Schnauss and you know what you're getting with Schnauss. \"Possibly turtles?\" I wrote. Blimey. Shut up, Fats.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.954 by SectorSeptPESS004 - Stigma - Too Long LP by StigmaFat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents five more brilliant albums:Paraadiso – Unison (SVBKVLT)Paraadiso is a project by Italian DJ TSVI and the audio-visual production Seven Orbits. So I assume there is a visual element to this, although I'm only reviewing the audio. The span of Unison is incredible, with, at varying points, nosebleed drum mayhem, transient choral voices, shattered fractals of tortured bass, and tidal washes of soothing melody. The choir bits are ace. The blurb compares it to FSOL's Lifeforms, and that's actually not a bad take. Pauline Anna Strom – Angel Tears in Sunlight (RVNG Intl.)This was meant to be Pauline Anna Strom's big comeback. This San Francisco composer had been dormant in the music industry for decades, instead committing her time to Reiki healing. Her unexpected death a year ago meant this became a posthumous album – and what a legacy. These shiny instrumentals feel like nature writ large, with chimes and glistening synths evoking long summer afternoons and placid shorelines. All with a process or library music feel. A truly beautiful work.Planetary Assault Systems – Sky Scraping (Token) The seventh album from Luke Slater’s hard-pumpin’ techno alias starts with an ace pun. The first track is called Labstract. Like abstract, but made in a lab. My scientist readers are going to love that. This is Slater in pure techno mode. Thump, thump, thump, thump. Rustle, squeak, squeak, thump, thump. Hiss, hiss, bang, bang. Thump, thump, rattatat, rattatat. It's pounding and hypnotic and sometimes I think it's a chem-mystery why all music isn't like this all of the time. Geddit? Chemistry. Chem-mystery. No? Oh for goodness sake. Richard Norris – Hypnotic Response (Inner Mind)\"Set phazers to mesmerize\" says the American blurb with its fancy letter Zs. Hypnotic response indeed. Looping analogue synths lock into simple arpeggios, all drizzled with a sepia library-music wash. The bold Arca builds over 11 giddy minutes, its fuzziness barely changing and yet holding us spellbound throughout. The missing link between the warmth of modern artists like Luke Abbott and, in once supercool chord change, 1980s theme tunes. Rival Consoles – Overflow (Erased Tapes) Over to my Electronic Sound review for this one, incidentally another album on this list written for a choreographic dance production. \"There’s a halogen hum throughout, its metallic yaws and molten drum pads bleached with a scorched ambience... He shows a human yet hesitant side in scattered vocal radio transmissions or as voice-responsive algorithmic ambience... his trademark keyboard shimmer as on point as anything on his [previous] spine-tingling studio albums.\" So there you go. Another corker from RC.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.Angel Tears in Sunlight by Pauline Anna StromHypnotic Response by Richard Norris"},
{"title": "60 best electronic music albums of 2021: Jon Hopkins, Kasper Marott, Leon Vynehall, Loscil & Maxwell Sterling", "date": "Dec 30, 2021", "text": "Fat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents five more brilliant albums:Jon Hopkins – Music For Psychedelic Therapy (Domino Recording Co) Everyone’s favourite piano raver came up with this album of beatless meditation after spending time in an Ecuadorian cave. An Ecuadorian cave! Do you know the most interesting place I've been this past week? Sheffield. Who's the winner now, Jon Hopkins? This is all very nice and ambient and epic and perfectly suited to playing in big churches. An inbetween album for the electronic master. Lights down, sit back, take in all the beautiful Hopkins production. Full of caves, it is, Sheffield. Can't move for 'em.Kasper Marott: Full Circle (Axces Recordings) Marott is a Copenhagen techno producer whose first EP Keflavik, released a few years ago on Modeselektor's Seilscheibenpfeiler label, created a bit of a fuss. This debut album of euphoric club cuts takes us through breezy electronic jams, breakneck acid techno, cheerfully skippy breakbeats, urgent drum and bass and every other electronic music genre you could possibly pull out of a bag. I demand more fuss be made about Marott and his easily distracted but totally celebratory approach to dance music culture.Leon Vynehall – Rare, Forever (Ninja Tune) Pitchfork calls him a \"master craftsman\". Mixmag calls him \"an artist of distinct talent\". Ethel from number 32 calls him \"who? Never heard of him. Are you going to return my circular saw or what?\" Jeez, Ethel, that the last time I borrow power tools from you. Where was I? Oh yes. This second album of dynamic downtempo techno-noise is essential listening. Such a mix of influences, from rave to classical to techno to jazz. It's a heady mixture and may possibly make you woozy. In a good way, of course.Loscil – Clara (Kranky)It's funny what people get obsessed with. Loscil took a short recording of a Hungarian orchestra, lathe-cut it to 7-inch, then scratched the heck out of it. He then used that final messed-up recording as a sample-base for the whole of Clara. I've not been that occupied with one thing since I built a lifesize blue-tac sculpture of H from Steps. The orchestra is all but excised from this unhurried ambience, as vast swathes of widescreen chords hover in the air, their shadows strangely bright.Maxwell Sterling – Turn of Phrase (AD 93)I read somewhere that double bassist Sterling took inspiration for this album from Los Angeles, London and Morecambe. In only one of those places have I played crazy golf. What we have here is a sonic palate that ranges from glooming ambience to wonky half-rave. It's difficult to categorise: in turn it sounds like hippos with an arpeggiator, wasps on a playground swing, and a jazz band populated entirely by insects. It was Morecambe, by the way. It had a windmill and everything.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.Full Circle by Kasper MarottClara by loscilFat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents five more brilliant albums:Foodman – Yasuragi Land (Hyperdub)Takahide 'Foodman' Higuchi comes from Japan's footwork scene, so there are rhythmic trills peppered throughout this curious genre-bending album for London's Hyperdub label. The album is as abstract as heck, mixing Japanese environmental music with an improvisational multi-track set-up. The tracks feel episodic. There's no bass. The loops come laden with memorable hooks, but they're bitten through with hesitations and land as lightly as a feather. You'll not hear anything else like this. Extraordinary.F.S. Blumm & Nils Frahm – 2X1 = 4 (LEITER) An underground German producer teams up with a classical maestro for an experiment in dub? Yes please. Over to my review of this album for Electronic Sound: \"We’re talking bull-by-the-horns electronic dub. Blumm brings his experience from his duo Quasi Dub Development, where a tuba did the bass work... All along, Frahm’s melodies ooze with sadness. Like the confused maths of its title, it shouldn’t work but it does.\" The dub bits really, really work. With echo and everything. Howie Lee – Birdy Island (Mais Um Discos)Beijing-based visual artist Howie Lee based the concept of this album around an imaginary floating theme park in which birds and ghostly spirits (I presume) go on the log flume together. It's suitably mystical and magical, with lilting accordions and jazzy drums lazily seeing the afternoon through. Imagine sparrows running a candy floss stall, or blue tits operating a Wurlitzer. Apparently, he's usually clubbier than this: we're certainly in pastoral territory. Not a rollercoaster in sight.Illuvia – Iridescence Of Clouds (A Strangely Isolated Place)Having written music journalism as long as I have, I'm pretty sure I've heard everything. And then someone like Ludvig 'Illuvia' Cimbrelius comes along. On the face of it, this is a sweeping ambient album typical of the excellent fayre produced by the A Strangely Isolated Place label (check their 9128 streams). But then... the drum and bass. The distant drum and bass, as if farted out by passing angels. An extraordinary sonic technique that already has me regretting not placing this further up my list.Jacques Greene – ANTH01 (LuckyMe)I had to break my rule about not including reissues in my best-of list because, oh my giddy trousers, this is so damn good. This is a collection of out-of-print records from earlier in Greene's career. The sparky house of Faded and the Brandy-sampling garage of The Look sound so in tune with recent dance trends, this might as well be brand new material. As jolly Jacques puts it himself, \"time became quite slippery in the past year and a half.\" Too right.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.Yasuragi Land by foodmanIridescence Of Clouds by IlluviaFat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents five more brilliant albums:Daniel Avery – Together In Static (Phantasy Sound) This album accompanied an especially written socially-distanced performance at Hackney Church in late May 2021. The last time I went to Hackney, I stayed in a miniature pod with black walls, and I've still not recovered. Nothing claustrophobic about this album though, despite Avery's knack for hot buzzy techno. Shaking techno rhythms lead to wandering analogue meanderings lead to, as the album progresses, genuinely optimistic IDM instrumentals. It's like a flower gradually opening: the release is glorious.Danny L Harle – Harlecore (Mad Decent)This album sees London producer Harle take on the personas of four people: DJ Danny, MC Boing, DJ Mayhem and DJ Ocean. Boing is the hyper one, Ocean is the chilled one... look, I haven't got time to introduce them all now. Just grab a Carling from the fridge and mingle with them in your own time. Harlecore is massive fun. There's banging euphoric rave, Scooter-style stadium crowd-pleasers, breezy 1990s drum and bass, hyper Italo piano house, and even a happy hardcore Golden Brown. Super daft. DJ Seinfeld – Mirrors (Ninja Tune)This is a second album of Barcelona-sun drenched vintage house from a Swedish producer previously best known for his \"lo-fi\" vibes. Recorded in Berlin and Malmo, this feels like a much more polished Seinfeld, all very sharp and snappy and Bicep-y. He filters UK garage into something much more sultry, and ain't afraid of a big fat French disco slam-down. One of those albums which is bound to be on lots of end-of-year lists. And yes, he named himself after the US sitcom. Better than DJ Everybody Loves Raymond, I suppose.Don Zilla – Ekizikiza Mubwengula (Hakuna Kulala)This is the debut solo album from Don Zilla, from Uganda's Nyege Nyege collective. The collective's name refers to the urge to dance. However, those expecting a party feeling will only be partially sated. A party, yes, but soundtracked by pummelling thuds, growling mechanics and machinery assaults. At points it sounds like it's taking arms against its listener, but it also sounds every concrete basement club in every techno city. Uncompromising, and all the better for it. Take your coat off, this party's just getting started.Eli Keszler – Icons (LuckyMe)This hugely proficient percussionist and Oneohtrix Point Never collaborator brings us his tenth album. The tracks are jazzy and laced with complex beats, often tumbling into scattered ambient mood boards. The drums are perfectly poised, and know when to withdraw when the atmosphere needs it. Nice work. Apparently you can buy Eli Keszler candle too. It's got top notes of mandarin, black pepper and carrot. That might be the most interesting thing I've learned about a percussionist all day.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.Together in Static by Daniel AveryMirrors by DJ SeinfeldThe Top 90 becomes a Top 60. Fat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents five more brilliant albums:Alessandro Cortini – SCURO CHIARO (Mute)The Nine Inch Nails keyboardist custom built his own synthesiser for this solo album. Quite frankly, that's just showing off. It's a droning, peaceful work in which synth lines follow simple paths before building into something more intense: the micro-rhythmic climax of Corri, the buzzing swarm of Sempre. A pleasing listen, and no doubt benefitting from his recent work with the analogue master Daniel Avery. Custom built? Pffrt. Couldn't just get a Casio from Argos like a normal person, could he?Andy Stott – Never The Right Time (Modern Love)Is Andy Stott is rhyming slang for (a) beats so hot, (b) techno hotshot, or (c) Westlife he's not. Answers on a postcard to the usual address. Always innovative, this Manchester-based producer strikes a perfect balance between the ethereal and the electronic. Cocteau Twins wooziness against metronomic percussion. Dusted Autechre-isms against heavenly chords. Ghostly vocals courtesy of Alison Skidmore. And every album cover in black and white to match the industrial brutalism of his music. I like this a lot.Arca – KICK ii (XL Recordings) Bjork’s favourite experimentalist released, like, a billion KICK albums at once. KICK i was last year's lockdown album. And now we have four more (slightly less than a billion, sorry). KICK ii does a kind of sun-bleached reggaeton. KICK iii is full of Spanish vibes. KICK iiii is all ghosts and witchcraft. And KICK iiiii does the hushed ASMR thing that sets my teeth on edge. I'm letting number ii get a place in my list because it's surprisingly accessible considering the contorted audio of her previous work. Also it's got a pretty impressive collaboration with Sia.Caro C – Electric Mountain (self-released, I think)Caro's fourth album was inspired by rock climbing – keen-eyed audience members will spot the use of a rock xylophone and carabinas in her live performances. In Electronic Sound, I called this a \"cosmic space boogie\", and it really is as uplifting as that sounds. \"Motivational vocals add a maverick attitude, declaring 'we are magnificent!' and 'you are mighty like mountain'. This is no stock Insta-inspiration: Caro delivers the vocals like melted cheese over a toasted bed of ever-loosening percussion.\" Definitely worth a peak-- er, I mean, peek.Cid Rim – Songs of Vienna (LuckyMe)Previous album Material was lauded for its day-glo instrumentals, so it's a brave move for Cid Rim to switch to a more mainstream direction. Well. Kind of. This mix of gently psychedelic pop and club-friendly floor fillers are funk-lite, full of joyfully weaving synth lines and Animal Collective-happy songsmithery. Cid Rim is still having fun in the studio: tracks like Purgatory have LuckyMe style rhythmic drops, and there's pumping bass a-plenty. As radio friendly as ever: no bad thing.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.SCURO CHIARO by Alessandro CortiniElectric Mountain by Caro CFat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents five more brilliant albums:Ripatti – Fun Is Not A Straight Line (Planet Mu)Vladislav Delay, real name Sasu Ripatti, joins Planet Mu for some fearsomely frantic footwork beats. \"Ever shoved a rapper through a mincer?\" said my review of the album in Electronic Sound back in the summer. \"Vladislav Delay cleaves hip hop into stuttered vocal shards, pelting them with frenetic drums... rushes of glorious techno, underpinned by bass deep enough to blow your mincer’s electrics. Dissected dopeness of the highest order.\" Dizzying and fragmentary, yet it all makes sense.Robert Ames – Change Ringing (Modern Recordings)What a CV. Co-founder of the London Contemporary Orchestra. Conducting for Jonny Greenwood and Little Simz. Playing strings for Frank flipping Ocean. It's remarkable, then, that this rich ambient classical album is Ames' debut. Think Sigur Ros filtered via Philip Glass. Amazingly, he recorded a bunch of music, slowed it down, then annotated the slower version on sheet music for the purpose of rerecording. A proper old-school approach to something that turned out symphonic and distinctly sistine.RP Boo – Established! (Planet Mu) Let's get one thing out of the way. Yes, that's a sample of Phil Collins' voice on All Over. You know what? It works. This is the only acceptable use of Phil Collins ever. maybe with the exception of Luke Vibert's I Can Phil It. The fourth solo Planet Mu album from this massively influential Chicago producer explores his early experiences with footwork and ghetto house. The result is an accessible collection of vocal slices, choppy rhythms and stuttering beats: a great primer on Boo even with the Collins.Sarah Davachi – Antiphonals (Late Music)I always thought a mellotron was something you could eat. Turns out its a mini-keyboard that operates with magnetic tape. The instrument was a key component in this latest work from Canada's favourite electroacoustic experimentalist. From horns to harpsichords, Davachi uses all the skills in her musical arsenal to come up with an ethereal collection of ambient meditations. It almost sounds like the echo of folklore past: stories of ancestors drifting on the wind. And it's definitely not edible, so don't chomp it.Sedibus: The Heavens (Orbscure Recordings) Alex Paterson teams up with his old Orb mate Andy ‘Ultraworld’ Falconer for a debut release on his new Orbscure label. \"Welcome to a wonderful evocation of classic-era Orb,\" I said in Electronic Sound. \"Over four sprawling tracks, liquid chords curl around portentous piano, then rise into post-club euphoria that would make Sabres of Paradise proud.\" It's dead Orb-y. No, really. Cut it in half, and you'll find ORB written down its middle. Enjoy this adventure right back into the ultraworld.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.Fun is Not a Straight Line by RipattiEstablished! by RP BooFat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents five more brilliant albums:Mouse On Mars – AAI (Anarchic Artificial Intelligence) (Thrill Jockey) I had a fascinating chat with Mouse On Mars earlier this year about their science fiction-ish project with scholar Louis Chude-Sokei. As I wrote in a review of the album, it's \"an inspired work that, thanks to the very human inspiration of Chude-Sokei’s cyborgian studies, has more interesting things to say than 'bleep bloop'.\" A very entertaining listen. A special mention too for Jan St. Werner's other album Imperium Droop, which was a great collaboration with improvisational drummer Kid Millions.Nala Sinephro – Space 1.8 (Warp)Raised in Belgium and now based in London, Sinephro is a classically-trained musician who just happens to have produced one of the nicest sounding, folksy ambient albums of the year. This is technically a jazz work, a genre for which I have very little love. However, armed with sultry piano and mad skills with a pedal harp, Sinephro strays expertly into electronics and effects to produce a woozy meditation more akin to a field recording album. Nightmares On Wax – Shout Out! To Freedom... (Warp)George Evelyn's energy is incredible: a one-man consciousness guru. It's no surprise one of the track titles here is Imagineering, this album having arisen from \"life-affirming realisations\". Actually, it doesn't necessarily stray from the car-boot soul he's known for, but the truly smokin' delight is the input from his many collaborators: Greentea Peng's flouride warning on Wikid Satellites is superb. Head-nodding beats, smooth soul vocals, Nightmares On Wax doing Nightmares On Wax. Nice one, George.Perila – How Much Time is it Between You and Me? (Smalltown Supersound)I once dropped a can of WD-40 lubricant. The can burst and the resulting high-powered instant fog of oil created an all-consuming fluid miasma that coated the room I was in and the two rooms adjacent. This glassy, glacial ambient album is that miasma. Tectonic plates of delicate instrumentation float endlessly in what Perila calls a \"silence prism\". I'm calling it a quietness can. An all-flooding, all-fogging quietness can.Rat Heart – Rat Heart (Shotta Tapes)Subterranean spookiness. Aaargh! Corroded hip hop beats. Woooo! Machine-gun electronic glitches. Lawks! Manchester / Wigan DJ Tom Boogizm’s superbly lo-fi album of crushed beats sits somewhere between RP Boo snoozing under his duvet and Actress having an especially grumpy session with a steel plate folding machine. Certainly one of this year's more pleasant surprises, and the winner of the Best Sudden Scream On An Album award 2021. AAAAAAAAARGH. Love it.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.Space 1.8 by Nala SinephroShout Out! To Freedom... by Nightmares On Wax & Greentea PengFat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents five more brilliant albums:John Tejada – Year Of The Living Dead (Kompakt) I've enjoyed Tejada's work with Reggie Watts: a real zippy approach to house music production. On this solo album, things are more simple. All bright and shiny. Sprightly bass drum pads skip hand-in-hand with spacey synthwork, while elsewhere the beats are slower and a little more broken, perhaps reflecting the introspective, lockdown theme of its title. In any case, it's a proper bag of loveliness, with a dubbier feel than usual. And I like it when the synths go pyow-pyow.Loraine James – Reflection (Hyperdub)For You and I was a cracker. I likened it to \"being parachuted into a leftfield techno metropolis without a map\" in my favourite albums of 2019. James's second album progresses her urban soundtrack of drill pop urbanistic futurism, or whatever it is. It's at once utterly r&b while slicing through that genre with a bass-busting chainsaw. It's complex and abstract, a gravity constantly pulling things down: Maxinquay on Xanax. Yet it's less bewildering than her previous work, now we're more attuned to its lackadaisical London vibes.Lotic – Water (Houndstooth)There are several things that come to mind with this second album of dreamy deconstructed electronica from this one-time Bjork producer. One: a choppy sea, sirens singing from beneath the waves. Two: ghosts singing your name from the clouds above you. Three: Kate Bush as supernova. Accompanying her gasping choral iterations are, as the title hints at, splashes of liquid synths and deep pools of electronic ambience. A deeply personal album that feels at once gentle and immensely powerful.Madlib – Sound Ancestors (Madlib Invazion)You know Madlib. Old Madders. L'il Lib. He's the hip hop guy turned jazzer who's been spitting soundpieces for over two decades. Sound Ancestors has all the feel of an old mixtape: the beats are smokin' and the whole thing has the warmth of well-needled vinyl records. Sorry for mixing my format metaphors there. The added element? This album was arranged by Four Tet, adding a sharpness to the blunted beats. As one review said, it's \"jazzy, dirty, clean, and mean.\"Meemo Comma – Neon Genesis: Soul Into Matter² (Planet Mu) Here's a bit of my review from Electronic Sound magazine. \"A mystical mash-up of ancient Judaism and imaginary anime is the mood board for Lara Rix-Martin’s latest: Mononoke with a menorah... Grumbling incantations, hesitant slivers of rhythm and downright spooky calls to prayer. Even the fluid beats of Tif-eret is subsumed into haunting choral blessings: it’s audacious stuff. Not so much field recordings as demonic transmissions from an abandoned quarry.\" A deeply curious album. The Kabbalah's gonna get yah.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.Year Of The Living Dead by John TejadaReflection by Loraine JamesFat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents five more brilliant albums:Flying Lotus – Yasuke (Warp)It's really nice to see Mr F. Lotus get his teeth into something as chunky as soundtracking a samurai series on Netflix. The telly programme evokes 16th-century feudal Japan, but this album feels much more modern. Trop hop beats, nostalgic analogue synths and fat computerised beats nestle up against its anime inspiration with the greatest of ease: lounge bar music by way of Tokyo. There's even a track (War Lords) which is Very Pink Floyd Indeed. A very different Flying Lotus experience, and we're all the better for it.Helm – Axis (Dais Records)\"Fractured clanging, hissing steam, granular haze,\" says the blurb. Wait, don't go. Luke Younger's returns to his low-fi noise roots for this debut on Dias Records. Its scratched industrialisms and pained clanking rhythms are certainly matched by its track names: Moskito, Repellent. But actually, it's surprisingly tuneful if you're okay with the whole apocalyptic building site thing: there's beautiful ambience to be found in this end-times EBM. And hey, if I'm going to have a haze, I want it to be a granular one.Herbert – Musca (Accidental)Here's a bit of my review for Electronic Sound magazine of this latest instalment in Herbert's ‘domestic house’ series. \"Each track is ever-so-neosoul, new jazzy standards made for a Gilles Peterson playlist... This is Herbert exploring his commercial rather than experimental side, the purported – and very Herbert – grunting pig and chatty fox cub samples kept largely under the radar.\" Forgot about the pig bits. Anyhoo, it's all very smooth and Radio 2, but Herbert always delivers everything with a wink and I love him for that.Humanoid – 7 Songs (De:tuned)I admit, this was a very last-minute addition to my list. This is the act that brought us Stakker Humanoid from back in the day. I'd just assumed it was some old rerelease. How wrong I was. The chap from Future Sound of London slaps us across the chops with chunky acid madness: listen to it squeal and bleep and yelp. Absolutely gorgeous. Nothing complicated: just an old drum machine and some significantly squelchy sonics. Just listen to Pyramid 17 go. 7 very good songs.Jana Rush – Painful Enlightenment (Planet Mu) This album is everywhere. It's the most hyped thing since Pogs or Betamax or that time I told Charlie Norridge I could balance a bunsen burner on my willy. For her second album, this Chicago producer moves from footwork into abstract experimentalism: chopped loops get caught in powerful cycles of shuddering bass, ecstatic vocal samples and ever-present urgent drums. Like looking at a jazz club through a kaleidoscope through insect eyes. Genuinely unique. Oh and always make sure the burner's switched off first.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.Yasuke by Flying LotusMusca by Herbert"},

The speaker-wobbling badboy loops brilliantly match the sheer ferocity of the ragga and dancehall vocals – take a bow, MC Irah. As good an expression of our pressure cooker society as anything else on this list, and rightly already topping other people's best-of-2021s. Calibre – Feeling Normal (Signature Recordings) Despite the chirpy dubstep and sassy half-step rhythms, this is Calibre in a mood. He's drum ‘n’ bass royalty, but this 16th album (!) is among his slowest, the BPMs reigned in to produce one his more introspective works. As I wrote in Electronic Sound magazine: \"Dominick Martin delivers an umpteenth album of coffee-table drum and bass that’s a smooth as a buttered puppy.... ever-decreasing circles of frowning, thoughtful electronica.\" Not what I expected at all, in a good way.Clark – Playground In A Lake (Detusche Grammophon) It has been fascinating watching the career of this Warp alumnus, er, warp into something totally new, moving from his barnacled techno beats into something much more neoclassical. This is a \"concept\" album, whatever that means these days, and is his first appearance on classical label Deutsche Grammophon. Clark's 12th album isn't just classical, though: it's folk and weird horror, with vocals from Clark himself, Afrodeutsche and a choir boy. As atmospheric as heck and very much following on from his Daniel Isn’t Real original soundtrack.Fatima Al Qadiri – Medieval Femme (Hyperdub)You can always expect something special from this Californian Kuwaiti. On Medieval Femme, we find ourselves somewhere between ancient Arabian history and some far-flung future chill-out night. Sung vocals hang lazily amid heavy reverb, an elegiac organ melts against misty half-beats, harps hang in the air quivering with anticipation. The Middle Ages meets the Middle East. This is possibly Al Qadiri's most accessible album to date, so consider it an excellent starting point. Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders & The London Symphony Orchestra – Promises (Luaka Bop)This is a biggie. Sweep everything else off the table, cancel the milk, hang up on grandma. Floaty, as I like to call him, has always been classical adjacent, his shuffling house beats always feeling grand. He's got his own electronic \"ensemble\", for goodness sake. Here, he teams up with the LSO and jazz saxophonist Sanders for what might be his grandest project to date. It's slow and bluesy and a little too jazzy for my tastes, but still, its a landmark release whatever you think of stupid saxophones.This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.Fire by The BugMedieval Femme by Fatima Al Qadiri          Fat Roland's Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021 presents five more brilliant albums:  Aleksi Perälä –    Spectrum Analysis    (Repetitive Rhythm Research)   I want to avoid reissues and repackages in my best albums list, but this  triple vinyl compilation of Perälä's Spectrum Analysis minimal techno series  was too much of a treat not to include. The mathematical simplicity of his  micro-house loops are made to move your feet and soothe your brain. The  Finnish Rephlex veteran is so prolific, this entire list could have just been  him. You're only allowed one per end-of-year list, Alekksi. Reader, do  yourself a favour, and spend some time dangling in the laser web of his music.  It's quite something.   Alva Noto –    HYbr:ID    (NOTON)  There will be a few albums in this list that were written for choreography.  You don't want me writhing in my leotard, so you'll just have to imagine the  dance moves that accompany this low-key electronic scree written for ballet  bloke Richard Siegal. Synths hum, static leaks, ambience drones. It's  ASMR in its attention to detail, its little landscapes of electronic  experimentalism building into a sonic experience that seems to occupy every  inch of the room. Its inspiration is astrophysics and cinema, but it sounds  like the atoms between the two.       Amon Tobin –      How Do You Live      (Nomark)           25 years after his debut, Amon is still going. It's testament to his talent    that he continues to be uncategorisable. Buzzing synth cycles meet swooping    strings, end-of-the-pier organ lines spiral over hippy guitar noodlings,    shimmering half-grooves follow breathy folk vocals. It's scratchy and    sketchy, glitchy and groovy, always with a cinematic bent. Albeit a curious    indie film than a sweeping blockbuster. A vision of Sergeant Pepper    appearing in a cloud of spliff smoke.           Anthony Naples –      Chameleon      (ANS)          This New York label owner created his latest album by jamming out the tracks    on real instruments first rather than, say, start with the software or    bashing kittens with a mallet. So where I'd normally expect driving house    music, instead we have something much more organic and experimental. In    these late-nite ambient instrumentals, blues-style drums meet chill lounge    chords and unhurried melodic loops. Its lack of urgency belies the fact this    is a producer at the top of his game. A soundtrack for sleepy parties.          Arovane –      Reihen (12k)        Uwe Zahn is back, and this time he joins Taylor Deupree’s 12k label for a    bunch of noise wafflings produced in early 2021 using a limited range of    gear. The blurb mentions pointillism and etherealism, with Zahn    citing \"intermodulated oscillators, amplified and distorted\". This is tiny    sound writ large: cascading ambient mirages reflect playfully against the    resonating harmonics of fuzzy analogue synth lines and hammer-dulled piano    chords. It's almost church-like in its stillness.  This is part of a series of the Best Electronic Music Albums of 2021. Read it all here.How Do You Live by Amon Tobin    Chameleon by Anthony Naples  Welcome to my top massive brilliant albums countdown for 2021. I'm going to drizzle you with so much great electronic music, your earlobes will become towels.I've done this end-of-year list since before Jesus was a twinkle in a donkey's eye. See all my previous best-of blogging here. This year will be a little different. I've grown uncomfortable with the arbitrary nature of a numbered countdown. I'm not sure that format suits someone as fickle as me. I can't even decide every morning whether to brush my teeth with toothpaste or Primula. It's time for a change. I'm going to try pile cream instead.I have 90 favourite albums to tell you about. I have collated those 90 albums into the following groups: none of these albums will have specific numbers allocated to them, other than being in their wider grouping.Top 90 Electronic Music Albums – what would have otherwise been numbers 90 to 61Top 60 Electronic Music Albums – what would have otherwise been numbers 60 to 31Top 30 Electronic Music Albums – what would have otherwise been numbers 30 to 11Top 10 Electronic Music Albums – what would have otherwise been numbers 10 to 1In each group, instead of having the albums counted down Top of the Pops-style, they will be listed alphabetically by artist. The one exception is, I will still have a number one best album. I still like the idea of having one \"winner\" even though I will have changed my mind two weeks after publishing it.I hope that makes sense. If numbers confuse you, please play Kraftwerk's Pocket Calculator until you understand.The other thing to know is that I like every single album on this list. It's not designed to be comprehensive, and I will have missed some obvious things off, but chances are if I've appreciated an album, it will be included here. Every dang note of music I'm about to link to is worthy of your attention, whichever group it's in.Ready? Let's go. The list will appear as hourly blog posts throughout December 30th and 31st, with several albums in each post, with the final number one bestest album revealed on the evening of the 31st. I haven't written a single word of any of this yet, so I'd better knuckle down.Stand by..."},

Their slogan is \"Everyone's An Artist\". I suppose I have some experience, having illustrated Edinburgh Fringe shows and my columns for Electronic Sound magazine. But the exhibition is very much a level playing field. With painted flowers on. And little marker pen faces on every blade of grass.The first Manchester Open in 2020 displayed over 500 artworks. If you stacked 500 Mona Lisas on top of each other, the pile would be a bit taller than the Empire State Building. That's quite the elongated edifice of enigmatic smiles.I love the idea of my piece, which is called Daft Punk At Home With R2-D2, nestled among tonnes of other framed pictures. I hope it'll be overwhelming, like walking into the Louvre and having a hundred masterpieces pelted at your head at once. Ouch. Those frames are sharp. Stop it. OUCH.My piece was originally produced for an Electronic Sound column about Daft Punk. It was fortuitous that (a) the illustration was produced within HOME's calendar guidelines and (b) it stood on its own as an artwork. Without the writing attached, much of the illustration won't make sense. Which is great. Look out for the little fluff of blue lint. And a Henry hoover (pictured).I'm hoping the exhibition will catapult me into the highest echelons of artistic genius, and the name Fat Roland will be uttered in the same sentence as famous British artists like Damon Hurst, Tracy Ermine, David Hockey-Stick and the one made of bacon.The Manchester Open will open (geddit?!) to the public on January 24th, and will keep being open to the public until it stops being open to the public on March 27th. There's an opening weekend from January 21st, but I believe this is just for artists, so if you try and get in and you're not an artist, they cattle-prod you. However, \"Everyone's An Artist\" so I'm hoping they cattle-prod everyone just to be on the safe side.More about the Manchester Open here.Further Fats: Like New Years Day to the sound of Autechre (2009)Further Fats: Is my Boards Of Canada mash-up art?

{"title": "Jesus and me in issue 84 of Electronic Sound magazine", "date": "Dec 21, 2021", "text": "In issue 84 of  Electronic Sound magazine, I talk to Jesus about how he invented big beat. No really. The actual Jesus. He was pretty easy to track down because he's always leaving his contact card in phone boxes. Landline number, of course. He's pretty old school.As the first paragraph goes:“It started shortly after the sermon on the mount. I was banging on about peacemakers and being salt of the earth, but people still were sinning and blaspheming and fornicating. Right there in front of me. In front of the mount.” Jesus Christ munches another finger of his Kit Kat. “So that’s why I invented big beat.”As you can see from the excerpt above, I took a photograph of Jesus while being farted at by a camel. That's a sampler he's holding there. He's always holding some kind of electronic music equipment. Michelangelo was always painting them out. In my regular column, I also launch my new social media network Fatr. It involves a Cornish pasty and Shane MacGowan and willy pills and this:Please identify all the spiders in this gridded photograph of the Taj Mahal. Now click the box that says ‘I am not a robot’. Exactly what a robot would click: you will now be disconnected from the internet.This is all completely serious, by the way. Please don't be laughing at it.

{"title": "Apart from the music, there is one thing wrong with Ed Sheeran's Tiny Desk Concert", "date": "Nov 29, 2021", "text": "Here's a screenshot of the pop music artist Ed Sheeran performing one of those NPR Tiny Desk Concerts.I can't remember what he performed. One of his pleasing ditties, I suppose. A warm guff of mainstream melodies. Maybe he performed a six hour homage to kittens being drowned in a vat of Monster energy drinks. I don't know. I could barely listen to more than a few seconds of his Tiny Desk Concert.No, the music is not the point here. Take a look at that screenshot. Go on. Take a look. Take a close look. Can you see what's wrong? It's there, glaring you in the face.Here is Ed.Look at his cute hamster face. He's holding that guitar deftly. No doubt he's good at holding other things, like potted plants, soft cheese or ransom letters. Ed is standing in the middle of the room, light from the windows gushing through his legs. He is, right at this moment, probably singing the word \"spatula\".Next. Here is the concert.The musicians stand around Ed because standing around the singer is the minimum requirement to create a concert. I wonder what their names are. Malchom. Guffery. Kendoolix. Colin. Although we can't see a drummer, I reckon there are seven musicians. That's a lot of people to fit into a room, especially when it's a home library where half the books seem to be missing. Nevertheless, good concerting, musicians.Finally. Here's the desk.YOU'RE MEANT TO BE BEHIND THE DESK, ED. Not around the desk. Not near the desk. Not, as in this case, not only standing next to the desk, but facing the wrong way so you can't even shuffle sideways and open the drawers.Look at Lizzo doing her Tiny Desk Concert. It appears to be a reception desk, slightly shallower than usual. Lizzo is behind the desk. Therefore Lizzo is doing a Tiny Desk Concert.Look at Miley Cyrus doing her Tiny Desk Concert. She's clearly positioned in front of a child's make-up desk. Therefore Miley is doing a Tiny Desk Concert.Even flipping Coldplay get the desk thing right. Look at how many people are behind that desk. There's even a poster on the left showing someone sat at a desk. Ed Sheeran is doing it wrong. The desk, which may or may not be tinier than usual, is not being interacted with. It is separate from the performance, as if a desk thief has dropped it by mistake while running from the dining room to the billiard room.This isn't a Tiny Desk Concert. This is a Tiny Desk Next To A Concert.The fact that it took me ten minutes of scrolling through Tiny Desk videos to find those desk-performance links because it turns out hardly anyone doing Tiny Desk concerts has a desk in their video therefore rendering the series a total con IS ENTIRELY IRRELEVANT.

{"title": "A pressing problem: trouble at t'mill for vinyl production", "date": "Oct 30, 2021", "text": "The vinyl production industry is in meltdown. Which could be a good thing if melted vinyl records made crude oil or liquorice. But it doesn't. This means trouble, with Mixmag saying the industry is in \"a state of chaos\".I'm planning on buying my mates 37 copies of Ed Sheeran's new album for Christmas. That's 37 vinyl copies to each friend of Ed's =. That's his album name, by the way, not a typo. My pals are going to love me, especially as each one will be individually wrapped in three rolls of toilet paper.However, there's trouble at t'mill. Are records made in mills? No idea. Anyway, due to extreme weather, staffing shortages, a lack of raw materials, and vinyl now outselling CDs for the first time in history, it's taking longer than ever to get a record pressed. Especially if you're a small label in a queue behind a mass-producing major label. Vinyl production seems to have more delays than a dub reggae remix of the band Delays. This means consumers may be waiting a long time for their vinyl. A bunch of mums aren't going to get their Abba or Adele for Christmas Day, leaving weird Uncle Derrick to recreate entire albums on the spoons.It's really unfortunate for small independent labels, who pride themselves on high quality product that's now in an endless queue behind some dreary Pink Floyd special edition. And with Brexit making Bandcamp sales to EU customers uneconomical, they're having to work harder than ever to make any money. Sorry, that last paragraph was all serious. Erm. Sausages. Clowns. Cats falling off tables. Phew, saved it. The Mixmag article suggests solutions might be found in an increase in pressing plants, the revival of dubplates, and a more creative approach to physical releases. However, electronic music duo Posthuman seem to have a more pragmatic handle on things, saying the whole thing will burn out soon:\"As soon as it isn’t profitable, [the major labels] will jump ship just like they did before. There has to be a saturation of Led Zeppelin and Elton John B-sides where the public will just say ‘enough is enough, we’re not buying any more’. I don’t think this crisis will last for much longer.”I'm off to record a cover version of Ed's album on my cassette player. Piano, Casio keyboard, trumpet, kazoo. No spoons. I'll copy it across on the tape-to-tape bit of my old hi-fi unit. If I set it to double-speed, I'll easily have a load of toilet-rollable copies done by Christmas.

{"title": "Wipe that smile off your face: ravers go right wing", "date": "Aug 31, 2021", "text": "Have a read of this article by music writer Harold Heath about the UK dance scene's uncomfortable dalliance with the far right. Go on. Have a read. What do you mean you haven't read it yet? Read it. READ IT.    In the article, he outlines the bizarre phenomenon of the acid house movement being co-opted by anti-lockdown protesters. The anti-establishment attitude of rave culture seems to link all-too-neatly into anti-vaxxers railing against the status quo. Not actual Status Quo. Just the general status quo.A few weeks ago, I witnessed an anti-lockdown protest in Manchester. The posters and t-shirts were full of conspiracy theory nonsense. Their main symbol was the yellow smiley face. This left me pretty shocked and not very smiley at all.Obviously, I was more horrified that so many people want the virus to run amok among the most vulnerable in our society, but hey! Don't use our smiley face. It's OUR smiley face. That gaudy vacant fake emotion is reserved for us ravers, not keyboard warriors on day release.Those Little England Brexiters probably don't even know what the symbol stands for. Peace, love, unity and having fun? They wouldn't know those words even if they were tattooed on the massive snowflake that replaced whatever brain they used to have. Yeah, I can do mixed snowflake metaphors too. I thank you.Of course, not everyone who is anti-lockdown is right wing. But these kind of protests definitely lean towards a political side. Folks frothing at the mouth about \"face nappies\" are a virus-filled sneeze away from the grim world of self-serving libertarians falsely claiming victimhood, through to the uber-grim underworld of full-on anti-Semitic conspiracists. Yeeps, keep it light, Fats.It's not possible to be a clubber and be right wing. Simply not so. I'm sure there are conservatives that go to Creamfields, which totally destroys the opening point of this paragraph. But the very act of clubbing is a political statement. Just ask John Major, whose government legislated against repetitive beats.As Heath reports: \"There are a set of shared values around tolerance, inclusivity and community, born in the very earliest days of disco, that run through the DNA of house and techno that we like to think we all share.\"Although the disruption to the dance music industry has been difficult for those trying to make a living from promoting, performing and hospitality, going on Covidiot marches is the antithesis of what the dance music scene should be about.I would have left my blog post there, but something else just happened. Something awful. And alluring. But mainly awful.I won't post the video here, but at the time of writing, the internet has been reeling at a recording of Pob-faced Tory Michael Gove clubbing in Aberdeen. Proper going for it, he was. In his suit. You can look it up on an internet near you.Look at him dancing. Writhing, gurning, waggling his arms as if trying to bat away poor people asking for money. I can't stop watching: I'm repulsed yet strangely turned on. Ooo, flip my second home, Michael. Pull out of my EU, why dontcha.Gove has clearly done a biscuit tin of eckies and will no doubt be a member of Kicks Like a Mule by the end of the week. What? Oh, right.

{"title": "Backstage with the Backstreet Boys (off camera)", "date": "Aug 7, 2021", "text": "While tidying, I found an old photograph from the time I met pop royalty.I wish I could say it was a picture of me meeting the Backstreet Boys. Sadly, I'm in the room, but I'm behind the photographer waiting for them to finish this photoshoot.This was backstage at the Manchester Apollo during their 'Live In Concert Tour. It was late 1996, around about the time Quit Playing Games (with My Heart) launched them to international acclaim. I was a local journalist, and I'd rung up their PR people pitching an article called 'backstage with the Backstreet Boys' in which I hung around backstage with the Backstreet Boys. The simple ideas are the best.So here I am, off camera, hanging out backstage with the Boys. I have no idea how I ended up with a copy of the photograph. It doesn't look much like a PR shot. Nick Carter with the floppy blonde hair is hiding his face, Kevin in the East 17 hat looks extremely bored, and the one trying to show his belly button (AJ?) was only posed like that because he took a flying leap onto the sofa at the last minute.I half wonder if I took this photograph myself, although I know there was a pro photographer in the room because a magazine called Big! showed up to take pictures of Nick Carter. He was big hit with teen fans at the time. They set up a portrait station just to the left of where this photograph was taken. I can only assume the proper professional photographer took this pic, and they sent through a copy via their PR people later.That said, I nearly had the opportunity to take lots of photographs with lots of cameras. On arriving at the stage entrance of the Apollo, I was mobbed by teenage girls. They were amassing like Hitchcock's birds in the vague hope of spotting a Backstreeter nipping out for a fag. On wading through the teenage throng, I must have said something like \"EXCUSE me, can you let me past, I need to get to the band, don't you know who I AM?!\". Suddenly, I was their easiest access to their pop heroes. They were armed with those insta-cameras that you use for holiday snaps: I immediately had a dozen of them shoved in my face. \"Can you take a photo of Brian? Tell them Tracey says hello!\"The atmosphere backstage was quite amiable. The cheeky sofa-diver (or is it Brian?) was hyper, and spent the time pinballing around the room like a terrier on heat. I chatted to Kevin for some time, and came away supremely impressed. Although BSB were a manufactured boy band, discovered by pop mogul and Ponzi scheme fraudster Lou Pearlman, they'd been working hard as singers, and they seemed more authentic than the infinite number of copy-paste Ken dolls that were clogging the charts at the time.If I find the published 'backstage with the Backstreet Boys' article, I'll let you know. Fancy finding something like this from 25 years ago. I had no idea I had this photograph: until now it had only existed as a memory, mainly of the belly button bloke (Brian, I'm sure it's Brian) diving onto the sofa.And what horrible curtains behind the sofa. I suppose horrible curtains was pretty much the hairstyle of the time, arf arf.Further Fats: This is a review of an Aphex Twin gig (2011)Further Fats: Mark Morrison pumps up the world and lets down my dreams (2020)"},

{"title": "30 qwerty years: a quick overview of my writing life", "date": "Jul 3, 2021", "text": "This month marks 30 years since I became a journalist.More accurately, it's 30 years since I crashed and burned in my A-Levels, and then at the age of 17 started three weeks of work experience at my local paper, the South Manchester Reporter. They kept me on because the editor said I could type fast. A skill which was, in all fairness, not that common in 1991.My first assignment was as a music columnist. I would review gigs in the grotty basements of Manchester venues, and tip local bands, always incorrectly, as the next big thing in rock and roll. My pseudonym was Trelawney, and the column was called Sound of the Suburbs, a music reference that was entirely lost on the teenage me. I was paid via a government Youth Training scheme, while previous Trelawney columnists before me were proper freelancers. I could type fast and I was cheap.Throughout the 1990s, I built up my career at the paper. I worked in the dark room at their production office, a job conducted amid fumes of stinking chemicals. Unlike the newsroom, I could blast the radio in the dark room, and this proved surprisingly informative, especially when John Peel took over a daytime Radio 1 show. I continued as columnist, then went on to become a chief reporter on two of their other newspapers, then music and features editor for a couple of spin-off magazines. Friend to the pop stars, I was. Well. For my allotted 20 minutes during a mid-tour interview schedule.Then came a big life change. I lost both of my parents quite young, and the subsequent mire of depression had me quitting journalism. After a brief time trying PR, I stumbled into what would become my longest career: bookselling. I was a bookseller for a full 18 years. That's, like, a whole Greta Thunberg. The great thing about bookshops is you're surrounded by writing and writers, so it was quite easy to carry on with freelance journalism here and there.We're fast-forwarding really quickly now. I did a bunch of DJing. I started this blog. People noticed this blog. I started performing. I became a spoken word artist. I released some books. I did an album (it's on Discogs). Our monthly night won awards. I now work for uber-cool literary venue the Burgess Foundation, I job which I adore and which combines all the skills of everything I've mentioned so far. Oh and Electronic Sound took me on as a music columnist, which means I've technically regressed all the way back to 1991.It seems weird to have a 30th anniversary of anything, and to count your adult memories in decades rather than years. As I've moved my performance work from spoken word into alternative cartoon comedy weirdness, I've increasingly felt like that naïve but endlessly creative teenager that first walked into the newspaper office asking for work experience. I'm growing older, but younger at the same time.And yes, I cann stull tyope fast. Sorry, try that again. And yes, I can still tyep fats. Nope. And yes, I can still type fast. Slick work. My old editor would have approved."},

It has come to our attention that there has been suspicious activity on this Blogger account for the past five days, masquerading as a blog series called Cover Me Bad.The conceit of the series is that the writer and performer Fat Roland thinks he's brilliant at creating cover versions of electronic music tracks. The 'joke', and we use that word loosely, is that he's really bad at it, and each blog post ends in a stream of idiocy.According to the Weblogs Policing Act 2005, this is really bad blogging. Let's use an example.Artist: 808 StateTrack: Flow ComaYear: 1988Reviews: [Mr Roland would then insert a genuine review here, but make it look like nonsense]He would always print something like that. It is alleged this is a random song choice, picked from his record collection. We have evidence to believe the decision is actually more half-hearted, plucked carelessly from thin air. He clearly is not researching his blog posts.He would then take elements of the track, in 808 State's the case the dirty acid and the skippy snares, and then imagine how he would mimic the sounds. However, instead of a serious tutorial on Ableton or similar music-making equipment, he usually resorts to bad puns or forced literalism. For example, taking the dirty acid and the skippy snares, he would have then talked about getting some actual acid and putting dirt on it, or placing a snare drum in a skip.This is, at best, lazy writing and, at worst, a crime against blogging. The evidence is written in black and white.In a recent post, Mr Roland pretended to have a conversation with his own blog, thereby breaking the structure of the Cover Me Bad blog series. This was a particularly heinous crime and we hope he doesn't do this again.The reader is advised not to have any contact with Fat Roland's blog, otherwise the reader will be charged with accessory to poor interneting.Yours sincerely,The Blog Police, 999 Letsbe Crescent (near Letsbe Avenue), Blogford, Bloggington, Greater Bloggery."},

If they don't cooperate, then I'd threaten to withhold their comfort blankets / Gameboys / Pot Noodles / crochet sets / whatever gets them through the day.There's a squeaky square wave keyboard motif that sounds like a guinea pig having a tantrum during a game of Monopoly. So I'd have a guinea pig. And a game of Monopoly.Look, I said I would stop doing this. It's demeaning.

That MEANS something, y'know.As the track fades out, there's some DJ-scratch style detuning going on. The effect is something akin to a malfunctioning laser in a science fiction film. So, er, I'd get Fatboy Slim and detune him. And get a laser. From a film.Look, I don't know. It's a classic track and nobody should be doing a cover version of it.

We're going to need lots of bells.Tubular Bells. Cowbells. Church bells. Anything that goes clang.Kettle bells, which I don't think are real bells, but are the kind of things weightlifters lift up to show people they can lift things off the ground. I want those kind of bells.Bell's whisky. I need to drink as much Bell's whisky as possible even though I read a booklet once that said blends aren't as good as single malts and I never learnt why but I remembered it so I could sound intelligent when I talked about whisky.The TV programme Saved By The Bell. Alexander Graham Bell who invented the telephone even though it was probably one of those urban myths where he got the credit but the telephone was actually invented by Ainsley Harriott or something. Ali Campbell from UB40! He's a bell. A camp bell. I'll have him as well. While I'm at it, I'll have David Bellamy, the Scottish band The Bluebells. And Belle and Sebastian. Actually, I'm not that bothered about Belle and Sebastian.I think that's going to sound lovely. Friedrich Nietzsche once said that “without music, life would be a mistake.” My beautiful cover version of Chime by Orbital, with its infinite cacophony of bells, finally gives Nietzsche's statement true meaning.Chime has got bells in, right?

Let me just fill my washing machine with coat hangers and put it on fast spin. There we go. A lovely sound.The next main thing is the screechy sirens bit. Sounds like constipated horses alarmed at a particularly aggressive cow. I haven't got a horse or a cow. Can you buy them off of the internet? Crikes, there's one website that says people drug horses at auctions so they appear calm. Nope, I'm not buying a horse. Let's compromise. Let's find a cow, get it constipated, and wait until it makes a noise. From either end. Sorted.The final main bit of the song is the voice that goes \"Back with another one of those block rockin' beats.\" Apparently this is a sample of Philadelphia rapper Schoolly D, who narrated Aqua Teen Hunger Force and played a big part in inventing gangsta rap.

Committed to one particular act, one particular musical backlist. You can't stray if you're a tribute band. Perhaps a Busted tribute band called Busted Flush could get away with a McFly track or two, but you have to stay within your own chosen discography.Not so for other cover bands. You know the kind. They play every Tuesday night in the back room of the Duck & Testicles, with the same old playlist. Achy Breaky Heart, Simply The Best, Knocking On Heaven's Door.

Set up an obstacle course of kitchen implements on the hill near my house. Whisks, toasters, knives, that kind of thing. Anything metallic that will make a clattery noise when hit. Put the vicar on roller skates, and as soon as they starts their sermon, give 'em a good push down the hill.And finally, the other thing about Are We Here? is that it's long. So once the vicar has rolled to a stop, their battered body embedded with various kitchen gadgets, yank them back uphill with a rope and start all over again.

{"title": "Noel Gallagher: mask-avoiding shopper and... Record Store Day Ambassador?!", "date": "May 7, 2021", "text": "Record Store Day is amazing. In an era when record shops should be crumbling to dust, Record Store Day has helped record shops not only retain customers, but turn them into destinations worth cueing for. Like Boxing Day sales, butchers at Christmas, or donkey rides.So whatever I'm about to say, you need to bear that in mind. Record Store Day is a wonderful thing. Yes, vinyl is so expensive, it would be cheaper to make them out of diamond-encrusted mortgages, but it is still a fantastic project and long may it thrive.Earlier this week, Record Store Day UK announced Noel Gallagher as their official ambassador. The announcement was accompanied by a video of Noel praising Sifters Records, where I bought my first ever seven-inch singles. And yes, as it says in Shakermaker, I would have been just 16 when Mr Sifter sold me those songs. So yeah, I get it. Noel. Record shops. Makes sense.However, Noel has been a naughty boy during the pandemic. Last year, he took against face coverings, wibbling something about liberties and not being able to catch the virus, and eventually getting challenged in a supermarket for not wearing a mask. \"It’s not a law,\" he said about the, er, law. Why is this such a mantra for so many older men?I had a moan on Twitter (hey, I'm an older man too) saying that mask avoiding puts all retailers and shoppers at risk, which it does, and this decision to appoint a 'mask denier' should be reversed immediately.I also wrote an email. For the sake of transparency, and to show off the fact that I know how emails work, here's the text. I got a quick response from Record Store Day, or rather the Entertainment Retailers Association, the organisation that drives RSD. Their reply follows my email below.Hello Record Store Day pals,I’m writing to ask you to reconsider appointing Noel Gallagher as ambassador for Record Store Day.Following a difficult year for high street shops, Record Store Day will play a more important role than ever in restoring activity to indie record stores. Appointing inspiring and characterful ambassadors is a great way to promote publicity for the project.However, Noel Gallagher is an insensitive choice at best, and an irresponsible choice at worst. He received widespread publicity for his refusal to wear a face covering as a mitigation against Covid-19. “They’re pointless,” he said, railing against the removal of liberties and referring to mask-wearing podcaster Matt Morgan as a “cowardly germophobe”. This is despite clear scientific evidence that, alongside other measures, mask wearing helps to protect ourselves and others from the virus.Opening up a high street shop presents an instant Covid-19 danger to customer-facing staff. Mask avoiding puts all retailers and shoppers at risk, and choosing Gallagher as the ambassador for RSD legitimises dangerously complacent views and puts at risk those people that will be working and shopping to make Record Store Day a success.Ethical considerations are part of the DNA of Record Store Day, whether it’s supporting high street shops, promoting War Child or raising donations for the AAPI Community Fund. This appointment undermines the image and ethos of your organisation.At least you didn’t appoint Ian Brown.Please, for the sake of RSD fans, customers and retailers, reverse your decision to make Noel Gallagher as Record Store Day ambassador.That's alright, isn't it? Covered my points, didn't waffle too much, didn't say 'bum' or 'willy'.Here is the reply from the Record Store Day people.Hi Roland,Thanks for contacting us about this.I appreciate your concerns and have contacted Noel Gallagher’s team about this issue.As background, the record stores chose Noel Gallagher as their ambassador as he has a long and celebrated history of supporting them and their businesses. He has taken part in RSD many times with special and thoughtful releases that so many of their customers love. What is important for RSD is that he shares their love of vinyl and independent shops, and for that reason RSD do not believe it is appropriate to reconsider his involvement as our ambassador.However, we have been reassured that Noel won’t be making any other comments about it whilst he is an RSD ambassador. We know just how hard every single RSD shop has worked to keep their customers safe throughout last year’s 3 Drop events and Black Friday and are confident this will not impact on any of the official social distancing rules in place.  All our shops enforce mask wearing for all their customers.Thanks again for your email and for supporting your local record stores.No doubt written through gritted teeth, but a very cordial response. That's enough for me. They've made their point, and I'm not going to labour mine: it's not as if they're toasting puppies over a burning orphanage. OR ARE THEY? No. No, they're not.I have some take-aways from this.1. The record stores chose Noel as their ambassador. This pretty much deflates my argument with one sharp prick. My worry was the message it sends about mask-wearing in record shops, but if the shops ain't bothered, then why am I moaning.2. Noel has been told to shut up about not wearing face coverings. This is brilliant news, and should ensure he sends the right signals as RSD ambassador. And if he suddenly goes all David Icke, they can fire him from the role, preferably out of a cannon.3. Noel's love for record shops is far more important to RSD than his skriking about masks. This is another indication, echoed in my last post about plague ravers, that there are many people in the music industry far less vexed by viral risks than me.That last point rankles the most. As we move into Covid 2.0, learning to live alongside this new element of our lives, mask-avoiders and plague rave DJs will thrive without consequence of their previous statements or actions. That somehow seems wrong.Record Store Day is amazing. Remember that bit? It's still true. And when next I go to an indie record shop, I'll trust their Covid precautions, if indeed they're still required by then. However if Noel Gallagher walks in, I'm pouncing on him and sellotaping album sleeves on his face. It's for your own good, Noel.Further Fats: Glastonbury's got 99 bands, and Jay Z should be one of them (2008)Further Fats: The Battle of Britpop – the dullest beef in the history of beefs (2020)"},
{"title": "The First Dance: scientific clubbing versus plague raving", "date": "May 3, 2021", "text": "The sight of thousands of revellers crammed into a Liverpool club the other night was initially quite disconcerting.Where were their masks? Why weren't they distancing? Where were all the awkward elbow bumps?Circus's The First Dance was actually one of two nightclub experiments at the weekend to see if large-scale music events could work with the right safety measures in place. The clubbers went through a scientific testing and monitoring, turning them into guinea pigs with glow sticks. Which obviously is the cutest thing in the world.These are the first official club events in the UK since the virus hit, and it was a delight to see. Big up to Liverpool for pioneering our way out of lockdown: until now, the city was only famous for Richard and Judy, The Zutons, and Ken Dodd.The line-up included the Blessed Madonna, Fatboy Slim and Sven Väth. The last name impressed me: he's one of my all-time bestest faves: here's me raving about him in 2010. Sven Väth helping end the apocalypse. Brilliant! I knew I could count on Sven...Except...I mentioned Väth on Twitter, and I was immediately put right by Posthuman, who in non-virus times runs a night called I Love Acid and is an all-round good egg. Turns out Sven is a plague rave DJ. Posthuman was hugely positive about the event, but likened Väth's booking to a \"having an arsonist on the fire safety board\".What's a plague rave? These are big club events held in places in the grip of Covid-19, with headline acts flown in while the virus spikes with deadly effect. In fact, the events are probably possible precisely because the host country has lax virus regulations. Clubbers arrive in their thousands and the virus claims its victims, putting pressure on already inadequate levels of testing and health care.Sven Väth has been touring India, a nation suffering a brutal Covid surge. Väth has always had an attachment to the iconic clubbing destination of Goa, so it was no surprise that particular Western Indian state was on his gig schedule. His appearance behind the decks at a particular Goa event in early March was described by one giddy electronic music website as going \"viral among fans of electronic music.\" No irony whatsoever. I won't link to it here.Let's draw out a timeline. In the month after that March Goa gig, Covid cases across India rose by a multiple of six. Now let's extend that timeline. On the day of writing this piece, around two months after that Goa gig, the number of cases across India was 26 times larger. And in Goa specifically, cases were 64 times higher than they were in early March, albeit rising from a comparatively lower base. Excuse the number crunching, but this helps us understand that any big-name DJ show taking place in India in early March could easily have had the consequence of being a super-spreader event.This isn't just about Sven Väth, of course. Business Teshno has been raising awareness of such Covid-calamitous behaviour for months, calling out the likes of DJs Dixon, Luciano, Solomun and Nina Kraviz.There are plenty of acts criticising plague ravers too. Carl Cox said in Mixmag: \"It’s irresponsible to be out there at the moment... Having a party in a pandemic, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. People are still suffering from this and we aren't out of yet. This isn't a Steven Spielberg movie called Panic, you know: we are in it.\"And Bicep called such Covid-careless DJs \"disgusting\", saying:\"They don’t need to do this. Take a year off, write an album. So many people lower down in dance music are struggling and this paints the whole industry in a bad light.\"I feel weird linking to Mixmag considering they've been raving about Väth's Liverpool appearance on social media, but anyhoo...This brings us back to the Liverpool experiment. This project was a shining example of science-led creativity, and everyone involved deserves a jolly good pat on the back. The line-up had its problems, but the larger picture could mean a route out of the apocalypse, and the revival of a zillion careers across the entertainment industry. It's a shame about Sven. I'd been slow to pick up specifics on the whole plague rave thing, hence me initially praising Väth's involvement. I'd seen Business Teshno's social media activity, but it all seemed rather confusing. Mainstream outlets like Resident Advisor and Mixmag don't seem particularly vexed with the plague rave thing, and there appears to be a widespread suspicion that once the clubbing industry gets back on its knees, the offending DJs will continue to coin it in, with no consequences of their pandemic actions.As for me? I'd love to go clubbing again – I Love Acid have committed to not booking plague rave DJs, and it will be one of the first nights I go to. That said, as someone who's higher risk, it'll be some time before I have the confidence to get all sweaty and giddy with strangers. We'll see.More importantly, what about the awkward elbow bumps? Honestly, a little wave is a lot less cringy. Let's stop the elbow bumps. Please. For the sake of future clubbing coolness, let's stop the elbow bumps.Further Fats: A ticket to ride: bumbling into MC Tunes and putting the green suit away (2007)Further Fats: The quarantine raves – Top one, nice one, get Covid?

{"title": "What was the best 1990 UK number one single?", "date": "Apr 28, 2021", "text": "1990 was a big music year for me. I was 16 going on 17, blossoming from a snot-nosed teenage misery into a slightly older snot-nosed teenage misery.This mean I have OPINIONS about chart hits in 1990. That's OPINIONS in capital letters. In fact, I'm pretty sure I could grade all of 1990's UK number one singles without much thought at all.Let's do it. A first-draft blog post, no editing, no research (apart from getting the list from Wikipedia). What were the best UK number one singles from 1990?Let's go through every dang one of them. Firstly, we have Band Aid II's Do They Know It's Christmas? Bros and Sonia? Pretty terrible, although not as embarrassing as the third one in 2004. Then there was New Kids on the Block's Hangin' Tough, which sounded as tough as a floppy curtains fringe (which hadn't quite hit the mainstream just yet). A bad start to the year. Then we have a half-decent run of number one singles. Kylie Minogue turning into a career artist with Tears on My Pillow, a weeping Sinéad O'Connor being iconic on the Prince-penned Nothing Compares 2 U, and Norman Cook foreshadowing his 1990s dance music dominance on Beats International's Dub Be Good to Me. Let's put Sinead and Beats into the top tier, which I will discuss at the end of this blog post.Remember, this is all first reactions. Looking through the list, typing these words, zero post-editing.Ah, now here comes Snap!'s The Power, a strange, angular block-party jam with Turbo B looking like a president or something (pictured). I hated this track when it came out: so strange and discordant. I was wrong, of course. This genius track goes straight through to the top tier.Madonna's Vogue was a huge hit, but it was no Like A Prayer. Adamski's Killer rocked my world in so many ways, and despite a pretty ropy album, this goes through to the top tier, as does England New Order's World in Motion which is the only acceptable football song alongside that crowd-chanty Pop Will Eat Itself track. From June onwards, it's a pretty rough run of number ones. Elton John's Sacrifice was the one where he started giving all his royalties to charity. Then came the novelty hits: Partners in Kryme's Turtle Power, which taught kids about the names of classical painters, and Bombalurina's Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini - Timmy Mallett later became a painter himself and has a website called Mallett's Pallet. No joke.Is it one T or two Ts for Mallett? No time to check: this is all first-draft.Those novelty hits were bad, but nowhere near as bad as The Steve Miller Band's The Joker, which is one of the worst singles of all time. I'm getting upset just thinking about it. Was this the one with the guitar wolf-whistle? I want this song to die.This next bunch of number ones, taking us from September through to November, I kind of respect, but they're not for me. Maria McKee's Show Me Heaven is an undoubted tune, The Beautiful South's twee A Little Time has its own charm, and The Righteous Brothers rerelease of Unchained Melody was a chance to revisit one of history's greatest anthems. My mum loved that one. No top tier for any of these, though. That leaves us with Vanilla Ice's Ice Ice Baby, only really good for karaoke, and Cliff Richard's Christmas number one Saviour's Day, which I don't think even God would listen to.So that's the year. Most of the good stuff was in the first half of 1990. Now let's visit the top tier choices, and sort them into some kind of order. We had weepy Sinead and Norman's Beats International and angular Snap! and Adamski's Killer and New Order's football fun. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I can grade this lot without much thought.The bestest UK number one singles from 1990, as decided on the spot by me.5. Snap!: The Power 4. England New Order: World In Motion3. Beats International: Dub Be Good To Me2. Sinead O'Connor: Nothing Compares 2 U 1. Adamski's Killer There you have it. Killer was easily the winner: it gave me permission to become my own bedroom-based keyboard wizard. To live my life the way I wanted to be-ee-ee-eee, yeah! I hope I didn't make too many mistakes in this entirely unedited blog post. We should do this again: 1991, maybe. *hits publish*Further Fats: The Designers Republic vs B12 Records: are the 1990s dead? (2007)Further Fats: The doctor (Adamski) will see you now (2018)"},

How about punishing your stupid idiot ears with some brand new electronic music?Here's a smattering of bleepy albums due for release in April 2021.Murcof's rejoins the Leaf Label for The Alias Sessions, an album written for a dance company in Geneva. I'm not much of a dancer, myself: my moves are limited to confused salsa, catatonic breakdance and eyebrow tango. Murcof's music often resides in little ripples of waveforms, but there are great big tidal washes of noise on this new album. One of my favourite Murcofs for a while.Jimi Tenor's putting out Deep Sound Learning (1993 - 2000). This scoops up a load of unheard stuff from, you guessed it, 1993 to 2000. Apparently Jimi bombarded Warp Records with endless DAT tapes, presumably using some kind of cassette cannon, and much of it remained in storage until now. I really want a cassette cannon. A tape trebuchet. A reel-to-reel rocket launcher.The album I'm most looking forward to in April is Eomac's Cracks. This is darkly desolate Dublin bass music that blends the atmosphere of Rival Consoles with the melodic motifs of Aphex Twin. Eomac (pictured above) is 'Cameo' backwards, but I don't know if that means he does backwards walk-on parts in movies, or whether every track is the 1986 party track Word Up! played backwards.What else? Look out for Facta's Blush, a debut album of folky electronics released on the label Facta jointly owns with the equally pastoral K-Lone. K-Lone's Cape Cira made my best-of-2020 list and Blush certainly feels like a sister album to some extent.By the way, I'd like to point out that I'm typing all this without the use of one of my index fingers. When cutting bread, I decided to use my hand as a chopping board. This wasn't a good idea, and I cut my finger.

{"title": "Justin Bieber's Justice injustice", "date": "Mar 31, 2021", "text": "Here's the Justin / Justice story. The cover art for Justin Bieber's new album Justice appears to have ripped off the logo of the French house band Justice. A big cross for a T is the clue: this was very much Justice's thing, particularly on their cross-emblazoned debut album.In itself, this isn't that incriminatory. In a past life I worked for a Christian bookshop and people plastered crosses on everything. They turned Ts into crosses, Xs into crosses, laugh-cry emojis into crosses. Maybe not that last one. It's a pretty route-one design technique, like turning Ss into snakes or turning As into anarchy symbols.However, there's a paper trail (and no, we don't mean this joke doodle from Justice's record company). We all know from cop shows that paper trails are bad. Apparently one of Bieber's people wrote to Justice's people, according to an email seen by Rolling Stone (the magazine, not the wrinkled rockers). No-one got back to the Bieber peeps, so they pressed ahead anyway, but now Justice's people are cross (geddit?!) and have issued a cease-and-desist letter. The war is on.Bieber also used audio of Martin Luther King on the album, for which he received permission. This is, of course, problematic in a different way. It's good that a famous white man is introducing black history to his fans, many of whom may never have been exposed to this stuff before. But it's also dodgy that a famous white man is appropriating stuff like this to sell records, especially when there are current black voices being silenced. This is, of course, from the same bloke who said Anne Frank would have been a belieber. It's all a bit icky.It also seems that the justice theme is pretty perfunctory. There's the Justin / Justice wordplay. Yep, I get that. Then there's the MLK samples, including the line \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\" But according to Buzzfeed, that's it. Hold On is about holding hands with his girl. Holy is about having a nice hug with his girl. Lonely is about the isolation of fame, probably while playing pat-a-cake with his girl. This is not an album about justice: it's just a selection of his usual watery pop guff.Let's think about that for a moment. Someone came up with the Justice title because it sounds a bit like Justin. They made an apparently half-arsed attempt to get permission to use Justice's cross logo, then used it anyway. And then they dumped some MLK speeches about justice into an album that is otherwise nothing to do with justice. That's like setting up a lemonade stall dressed as a lemon, with a whole range of home-made lemonades laid out neatly on a a table-cloth displaying a lovely tapestry of carefully illustrated lemons, with little handmade paper lanterns in the shape of lemons, then stealing someone's overweight poodle and calling the stall Look At This Massive Poodle. Just stick to the lemons, Justin. The unnecessarily purloined stuff is just complicating things. It's a distraction and it's getting you into trouble.I guess what I'm trying to say is if this ends up with a load of overblown proggy Justice remixes of Justin Bieber songs, I'm moving to Mars and never coming back. Now excuse me while I edit this blog post to ensure every small-case m looks like a pair of testicles."},

I've had a busy March, hence the lack of blogging. Here's a quick summary.I broadcast a show for Turn On Fest. This was Seven Inch, the one-hour solo work originally commissioned by The Lowry and adapted for the Edinburgh Fringe. It was great fun to film, and hugely gratifying to dig out my 200+ props to discover they hadn't all been eaten by piranhas.If you bought a ticket, thank you from the bottom of my bloomers. I'm not sure where the show will go next, but I will probably do a live audience version once things are a bit less socially distanced.I've been working on a couple of other projects too, including a video thing which will plop onto your internet fairly soon. Hush hush. (Please imagine me winking at your screen, but in a teasing way rather than in a creepy way.)I got vaccinated. This isn't really news because it's so dang common. As I pointed out on Twitter, the annoying thing about the vaccine is now everyone seems to be getting it. It's gone mainstream, like Feeder, Daft Punk or hummus. We need an alternative, cool rad vaccine: one that turns you purple and your head falls off or something.I launched the F1 Losers League. The what now? The F1 Losers League. This is an upside-down fantasy league dedicated for Formula One fails, a project which fizzled off in 2014 but revived for 2021. It's too late to enter, but have a look at the website here if you fancy it (I spent a lot of time on it so I hope you like it).Alongside my venue getting busier, thank Lordi, that's pretty much it. But that's quite a lot, right? All this plus long walks in the park.What? You want more? Right then.I climbed Everest. There. How'd you like that? Did it in one big step. I won the lottery fifteen times. I went to Mars for a bit, dropped some litter, came back. Didn't even apologise. I invented the snorkel. I joined then quit Good Morning Britain. I became an NFT. I did all that while getting wedged in the Suez canal while people tried to tug me off,See? Told you I was busy.Here's to a fun April with hopefully more blogging. Then again, if I wrote a blog post for every time I apologised for not blogging enough, I'd be blogging too much. What? Did that make sense?You can stop writing now.Thanks, penultimate sentence."},
{"title": "Tiësto is doing very well, thanks for asking", "date": "Mar 21, 2021", "text": "Admit it: the last time you paid attention to the pop charts, you were doing wheelies on your penny farthing during your job as a chimberly sweep.Let's talk about the current singles chart. In fact, let's talk about one particular artist in this week's chart: Tiësto. For me, Tiësto's name is associated with one era of music: millennial trance pop. I'm talking clean-shirted four-to-the-floor melodic house music with big fat chords, cheery basslines and chunky snare fills, all ever so Euro. Think Ferry Corsten, ATB, Armin van Buuren, or William Orbit doing Barber's Adagio For Strings.His 1999 track Theme From Norefjell is a perfect example. A big synth line, a no-nonsense driving beat, sweeping strings, and no vocals. In all honesty, it could have been produced by anyone. That's the point of all that post-Chicane / post-Insomnia stuff: just a \"pop-trance, pop-trance, pop-trance\" rhythm at a merry 140BPM. Good and solid, like a Volvo.In these modern times, I'd assumed Tiësto was an irrelevance, like VHS rentals, milkmen or smallpox. Dance music is way beyond that basic trance pop stuff, right? These are the days of trap, of mumble rap, of moombahton. Nope. Turns out, the dancing Dutchman is still going strong. Not only has he been busy remixing John Legend and Avicii, and teaming up with big hitters like Martin Garrix and Post Malone, he is currently enjoying what might be the biggest hit single of his career. The Business peaked this month at number three in the UK singles chart, and is currently only a few places behind that awful sea shanty thing that's ruined TikTok. Tiësto is *big* right now.This is starting to sound like one of those hagiography Wikipedia articles, but honestly, this really interests me. It seems weird to have Tiësto in the charts in 2021, because it doesn't follow a standard dance music artist career trajectory. Standard in my mind, anyway.Take Underworld or Erasure or Orbital as an example. They don't have hits anymore because they now occupy the Old Act Precinct of the dance music world. They'll make money from making soundtracks, or BBC commissions, or selling tour tickets to original fans whose wrinkled bodies could do with a good old dancefloor shuffle every couple of years.People like them aren't meant to be mixing with the cool chart kids after all these years. That's like going on your first date with the boy from school and dragging your Uncle Kevin along. Jeez, face the other way, Kevin, you creep.However, unlike my underwear, Tiësto has changed with the times. He doesn't sound like he used to. Instead of being indistinguishable from every other millennial trance track, he now sounds like every other Calvin Harris track. Again, solid, like a Toyota. The Business fits in brilliantly with recent dance music trends, and it's no wonder it's a hit.And watch out, because all that old trancey pop gubbins could be coming back too. Climbing to number 11 this week is ATB / Topic / A7S with Your Love (9PM). Yes, it's *that* ATB. Yes, it's *that* 9PM track.So maybe there's not much point in paying attention to the pop charts, because it all comes full circle anyway, like that big old penny farthing wheel. Encore une fois and all that. Either that, or next time you look twenty years later, the hit parade is still full of the same clean-shirted millennial trancers.You could say that Tiësto (there's a really good joke coming up, so get ready for it) has stood the tiëst of time. Ha ha ha ha. No? You just wait: that joke will be cool in a couple of decades' time.Further Fats: How to keep cool in a heatwave if you like dance music (2015)Further Fats: Soaking up the rays with Way Out West (2017)"},

Four and a half minutes of nothing. That's the schtick he's known for, whether he liked it or not. Kenny G's got his saxophone, Cher's got her autotune, Eric Morecambe's got his glasses, and Cage had this weirdly silent record.Of course, it's not silent. The record is actually a bunch of musicians sitting down in a room for a bit, not making any deliberate noise. What you're hearing is the sound of a room in which nothing much happens. But it's easier – and funnier – to think of 4′33″ as a silent record. Because then you get jokes like this in Viz:Let's zoom in:Hat tip to whoever I saw post about this online: the origin is lost in the depths of an infinitely scrolling timeline.There are plenty of other similar cartoon jokes on the internet about this quietest of records. A pianist messing up the song by accidentally playing a single note. John Cage carol singers standing shtum in the snow. And this XKCD cartoon.I'm not immune either. My show Seven Inch (March 17th tickets available here) has a silent John Cage joke. Of course it does. I leave no hack comedy stone unturned.There's a bit in the show where I talk about lyrics. This gives me a repetition joke as I recite the ad infinitum inanity of the Black Eyed Peas' I Gotta Feeling (although I'm swapping this out for a different song at the March 17th show).It also gives me a chance to recite the lyrics for John Cage's 4′33″. The joke is, of course, there are no lyrics: there's a whole load of nothing. Ha ha ha ha. So funny. Look at him standing in silence, confused. Sigh. It comes across as a special joke for music nerds, even though 4′33″ is stratospherically famous for a piece of experimental classical music.This is the point in the blog post where I hilariously include a quote from John Cage about his famous work, but actually it's just a few blank lines. Ha ha bonk: you just laughed your head off.Maybe I should do something in the show about the loudest song ever.

Instead of the album charts being full of cool young bands like The Kneepads, Post Office Flip Flop Explosion or Digital Colostomy, it's packed with bands that have been around the block so many times, they've worn a groove in the pavement.By the way, those cool young bands don't exist. I made them up.Mint Royale pointed out that this week's album chart is full of incredibly old LPs because music fans are streaming the same favourites over and over again. \"An Oasis compilation is getting enough steady streaming to probably just sit in the top 30 for ever,\" he says.He's not wrong. The current number one album is brand new: Tyron by that cheeky scamp Slowthai has been around for precisely one week. But that's not typical. 60% of this week's top 100 has spent more than a year in the charts, which is a big rise on five years ago when it was just 35%.Let's take a look at the longest-toothed dinosaurs in the current album chart. Here are the LPs sitting in the charts right now that have clocked up the most chart weeks since their release.ABBA: Gold – Greatest Hits (981 weeks)Bob Marley & the Wailers: Legend (965 weeks)Queen: Greatest Hits (933 weeks)Fleetwood Mac: Rumours (876 weeks)Michael Jackson: Number Ones (483)Oasis: What's The Story Morning Glory (476)Eminem: Curtain Call – The Hits (449)Amy Winehouse: Back To Black (411)Oasis: Definitely Maybe (392)Foo Fighters: Greatest Hits (392)Just outside that tyrannosaur top ten? Time Flies 1994-2009, that aforementioned Oasis compilation which has spent 389 weeks in the album chart, 216 of those weeks consecutive.This is theoretically fine. People are caning their favourite music, maybe having living room discos on Saturday nights while their pet dog looks on in confusion, and there's nothing wrong with that. You spin that old ABBA record, daddio.However, these craggy dinosaurs will sell bucketloads of albums come rain, wind or scattered sunny spells. And they're clogging up the charts, reducing the number of chart opportunities for newer acts further down the pecking order: active bands who are writing and releasing fresh tunes in a Herculean effort to gain chart recognition.Just a couple of blog posts ago I raved about the appearance of bleep techno in the hit parade and how it blew my tiny mind. I'm fascinated by new shiny things, like a magpie or a baby or a magpie looking at a baby. I don't want to delve into the latest album chart and see the same ancient faces with their expensive microphones and branded plectrums and anecdotes about how they met George Harrison once in a Tandy electronics shop. Serious yawn.That's like searching on YouTube for bitcoin investment advice, or the Mars landing footage, or the latest Taskmaster challenge, and every time the only result that comes up is that bloke singing Chocolate Rain.

You try the 'Contact Us' link to get help, and Mr Clippy pops up and starts singing Chocolate flipping Rain. You keep rocking those 2007 trends, daddio.Mint Royale goes on to suggest that perhaps the album chart should be subject to ACR. This stands for Accelerated Chart Ratio: in the singles chart, this is used to weaken the chart position of songs if they've been around a while. It's a modern oddity that became necessary after Ed Sheeran almost monopolised the charts in 2017 in a move that even the Roman empire would have called \"brazen\".I hope they sort it out soon. Otherwise the dinosaurs will continue to rampage unimpeded, and before we know it we've got a Lost World situation on our hands.

{"title": "Daft 'n' defunct: it's the end of Daft Punk", "date": "Feb 22, 2021", "text": "Daft Punk broke.I figured their batteries would never run out, or maybe they were eternally powered by Nile Rogers' electric guitar licks. Alas not. Daft Punk are no more. The duo has split up.Their split announcement came in the form of a video in which one of them explodes in a desert and the other one's all like \"hey, you just exploded in a desert so I'm gonna walk off now\". Even though it's just a clip from their 2006 film Daft Punk's Electroma, it's a pretty devastating watch.Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter formed Daft Punk in 1993 after becoming disillusioned with guitar music. They got their name from a Melody Maker review that slammed their crappy rock band as \"daft punky thrash\".The pair cemented their electronic music foundations when they hooked up with Stuart from Glasgow techno legends Slam, who signed them to his Soma Records and put out Da Funk. When Virgin Records came sniffing around, stratospheric success beckoned: platinum albums, oodles of Grammies, producing Kanye West, becoming actual French knights.Maybe their greatest legacy is comedian Limmy's oft-repeated tweet \"Check out Daft Punk's new single 'Get Lucky' if you get the chance. Sound of the summer.\" A gentle dig at their commerciality from a man who obviously knows the band's true origins: he has a pilled-up character whose catchphrase is \"where's the Slam tent?\", a reference to the aforementioned techno Glaswegians who discovered Daft Punk.Daft Punk are responsible for one of my strangest clubbing experiences, as recounted in this blog post:\"When I saw Daft Punk DJ at Sankeys Soap back in the 1990s, a French stranger tried to roll my torso like plasticine while saying 'wide boy, wide boy'.\"In all fairness to the glad-handed Gaul, he looked absolutely mortified. He bumbled off pretty promptly, no doubt in search of that elusive Slam tent.Daft Punk's output was one of diminishing returns. At one end of their career, Homework was astonishing, an abrasive analogue assault with crowd-pleasing sass. At the other end of their career, Random Access Memories was pretty rank. In 2013 I criticised its \"awful MOR pop\" and the \"horrible, horrible rest\". It gave them their only number one single and studio album, indeed one of the best-selling singles in UK chart history, but it dented their reputation forever. Which is saying something considering their commerciality had never been a problem previously, such as getting sponsored to only wear Gap clothing, or hawking Star Wars merch for Adidas, or having Coca Cola launch something called Daft Coke (!).Despite this slow eroding of their underground cool, they delivered a career highlight in 2010 with their superb Tron Legacy soundtrack, an album I once cautiously predicted would be \"at least ten per cent better than the Moomins film\". No, I don't remember a Moomins film either. It's most probably my favourite film soundtrack, despite the movie itself being rather eggy.Here's something else you might not remember: Thomas Bangalter gave us Music Sounds Better with You as Stardust, a top ten smash from 1998. Not only that, with his work on Bob Sinclair's workout-sampling Gym Tonic, later covered with great success by Spacedust (no relation), he's partially responsible for a zillion house music videos with lycra-clad dancers. Put those leg warmers away, Madonna.Daft Punk lit a tricolour touchpaper under the backside of dance music, showing that you could produce club-credible tracks and still appeal to a mass audience. Although they didn't quite roll and scratch as they used to, I'm gutted about their demise. Salut, boys."},
{"title": "LFO'S LFO", "date": "Feb 14, 2021", "text": "I was thinking today about how much of an incendiary bomb LFO by LFO was.The single was Warp Records' first big hit, peaking at number 12 in the UK charts in August 1990, wedged between Timmy Mallett and Craig McLachlan from Neighbours.\"We'd just been messing around with drum machines since we were, like, thirteen, tapping away at them like they were arcade games,\" said LFO's Mark Bell.And that's what it sounds like. Computer-y. Geometric. Made of pixels. It was kind of house music, which had been around for a while, but lacked any sass. No diva was going to start wailing over this kind of club sound. This was a track from a Leeds band, released on a Sheffield label. Is this relevant? I think it is. I'm tired of lazy generalisations about \"the north\" but there's no way this would have sounded as good if it was made in London. It needed a Yorkshire dourness: a sense of the industrial. After the burst of yellow smiley colour that was the rave explosion, LFO seemed to be built from actual scaffolding. Structural and metallic; absolutely clanging. Also they said \"LFO\" in the track. They were called LFO, they named their single LFO, the lyrics were \"LFO\". What a statement of intent. Tricky Disco's Tricky Disco, which was a hit at the same time, pulled the same stunt, a chirpy and childish \"tricky disco!\" spicing up the bleeps. That's like Orbital chanting \"Orbital!\" right in the middle of Chime, which they'd need to rename Orbital.LFO spent one week at the giddy heights of number 12 in the charts: it would go on to sell 130,000 records, solidifying Warp's future and beginning a whole new chapter in electronic music history. Mark Bell would go on to produce Björk, helping move her from a spiky popster into a baroque techno experimentalist on Homogenic.What replaced LFO at number 12 the following week? Together's Hardcore Uproar, the legacy of which should probably be saved for another blog post.As the Pharisees attacked Jesus, and so it was that pop music fought back against LFO. In the second half of the 1990s, a band called the Lyte Funky Ones appeared. They shortened their name to LFO, thereby confusing everyone forever. I hated them. These New England popsters were NKOTB wannabes who were about as techno as a Barbie doll head on a spike. Actually that's quite techno. I may need to think that analogy. Within a month of (the proper) LFO's commercial success, Timmy Mallett would top the charts, followed by the Steve Miller Band's The Joker which I think is one of the worst songs ever written. Vanilla Ice would try the eponymous lyric thing by saying \"Ice, Ice baby\" but it would sound all wrong.Good old LFO.

{"title": "Talking or not talking about Bad Lip Reading", "date": "Jan 31, 2021", "text": "This year, Bad Lip Reading is ten years old.The spoof YouTube channel overdubs pop promos and current affairs broadcasts, getting Rebecca Black into a Gang Fight, having the Black Eyed Peas sing about poop, and giving Michael Bublé a scatological hit song about a Russian Unicorn.This is the point where my jaw drops to the floor. Where did that ten years go? I can't be bothered to cut and paste emojis into Blogger, but if I did, you would be seeing a little yellow face with an exploding head. Ten years. Ten years!I really liked Russian Unicorn. It turned something as bland as Bublé, who posted a good natured video reply because that somehow is ultimate Bublé, into something full of unhinged energy. Even better was Morning Dew, which mashed together Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga and Jay-Z to make a peon to furry pet monkeys and broccoli pizza.Part of me insists I shouldn't like Bad Lip Reading. It revels in the worst pop music (Bieber, BTS, James flipping Blunt) and legitimises it through affectionate parody. It's decidedly off-key in places, referring to women as \"chicks\" and using a slang word for cerebral palsy that is pretty much verboten in the UK. And it's fallen hard for Star Wars fandom, that most tiresome of fandoms, producing songs about seagulls in space, death by chicken-duck, and Yoda's stick (\"it's just a stick\"). That last one is pretty poor, but then again they did come out with the smooth electro banger Hostiles On The Hill in which the Skywalker guy fights the long leggy things in the Antarctic or somewhere. You can tell I'm a fan.What's strange about the success of BLR, and channels like it, is its wonky place in popular culture. Take traditional TV as a comparison. 30 million people watched the Eastenders episode in which a vengeful Dirty Den give Angie divorce papers for Christmas. For years, that scene appeared in compilation shows and newspaper lists. It turned Christmas dark, and soaps have never looked back since.The most successful BLR video has four times the views: their top five videos have racked up a third of a billion watches. Yet in the past ten years, I don't think I've experienced a single 'watercooler' moment about Bad Lip Reading. The same goes for other YouTube big hitters at the geekier end of culture: Tom Scott, Drew Gooden, those never-ending Vox factual videos.This is all to do with the fractal nature of modern entertainment, where the metaphorical family sofa has been replaced by a wide scattering of deck chairs: the watercooler is now a zillion single water bottles. This more personal method of video consumption means we can spend an entire evening wasted on Fail Army clips without ever mentioning it to anyone ever. Maybe one day you'll mention it on a blog. Maybe.And yet, I don't fully buy that. It's not fractal, is it. What we've done, in the UK at least, is swap four or five terrestrial television channels (and a wall of DVDs) with fewer providers of televisual entertainment. YouTube and Netflix dominate the market as BBC1 and ITV did in the olden days. I don't have Freeview or anything, but don't tell me that endless menu of things you don't want to watch adds up qualitatively to anything more than a single day of programming on Channel Five.Anyway. Go and watch Bad Lip Reading videos so we can talk about it one day. A lot of it sounds like Uptown Funk but there are roses among the thorns. One of their BTS videos is childish cack, but the more recent BTS one seems to take ballad writing seriously.What did we do without YouTube? Actually, we watched Flash videos.

You might remember me from 'Fat Roland: A Space Odyssey', 'Dude Where's My Fat Roland' and 'The Fat Roland Who Went Up A Hill And Came Down A Mountain'.I thought I'd plop a quick update on my blog, lest you think I've been kidnapped by monkeys or something. Most of these updates are trivial. One is not (but don't worry, it's nothing too serious).Update one. I've been listening to a lot of Pet Shop Boys, and I'm in awe of the lyric:I'm always hoping you'll be faithfulBut you're not I supposeWe've both given up smoking 'cause it's fatalSo whose matches are those?Update two. I had to postpone my Seven Inch show for obvious lockdown reasons, but it's all cool because I'll do an online version that is going to kick ass. And because it'll be online, I'm going to have to storyboard my whole show, which will be equally fun and brain-breaking.Update three. I've just realised I'm the same age Susan Boyle was when she first appeared on Britain's Got Talent. I also saw a picture of myself which made me realise I'm now properly middle-aged. I'd better do something constructive with my life, like being a brain surgeon or flying helicopters or something.Update four. A few days ago, I got evacuated. And no, I don't mean I had a bodily mishap with a hoover. The river Mersey got a bit angry and I got a phone call from Floodline telling me my life was in immediate danger and I had better do something about it. I spent the night at a friend's place, then went back to a thankfully unflooded home once we'd be given the all-clear. My main takeaway. A bit of discombobulation, but it was amazing to visit my friends. Thank you, friends.Update five. Did you notice that update four was the non-trivial one? You did? Good.Update six. I tweeted \"I miss Donald Trump. His touch. His embrace. His warm breath. His fine collection of venus clams\" and it only got two likes, and now I'm worried people will think I actually want to touch Donald Trump.Update seven. Yeesh. I've said Donald Trump too much. Bernie Sanders is way better. I think he looks great in those mittens.Update eight. That's it. That's all my updates.

This is the new me: confident, assertive, dominant, and wearing a special hat that says \"I am the best\".In previous years, my new year's resolutions have been pathetic. Staying off Facebook, answering emails more quickly, being nicer to dogs, that sort of thing. Those resolutions are for small-minded losers. The new me, the 2021 me, is going to have a big mind.Everything is going to be bigger.Strap in, because these ten 2021 resolutions are so full of confidence, they're going to blow your socks off. You have rubbish socks, by the way. Yeah, you heard.Resolution 1:Beat Gary Kasparov at chessI reckon I can take him. I watched that chess drama with the gaudy wallpaper and I'm an expert at chess now. The castle goes down the edges, the donkey does a sideways jump like it's avoiding an ants' nest, and the tall one just stands at the back and does nothing. Easy. Once I've trounced him at chess, I'm going to destroy him at Ludo.Resolution 2:Become a superstar DJ like they had in the 90sI mean, how hard can it be? Stick a cassette tape on, pretend to move all the knobs, move the vinyl back and forth while saying \"wickedy-wah\", get on the front cover of Mixmag. I'm going to wear a tie-dye shirt with smiley faces on. The only song I'll play is Doop by Doop.Resolution 3:Populate MarsPretty simple. Buy a nice house on Mars, preferably near a newsagents and a well-maintained public leisure centre. And then populate the planet by either sexy bonky times or a mass cloning programme. I've not worked out the details: my many offspring can sort that out. I'm sure my logic's pretty solid on this one.Resolution 4:Patent a two-tier urinal systemMen! Fed up of queuing for a wee in public toilets? Want to avoid todger-tinkling tailbacks? I will invent a two-tier urinal system to speed things up. I can't reveal too much for intellectual property reasons, but Tier One is \"Measured Micturition\", which involves a tape measure and a waterproof notepad, and Tier Two is \"Splash And Dash\" which involves standing in the doorway and arcing over the loo queue. Just hand me my million pounds now, Dragon's Den.Resolution 5:Host the 2021 OlympicsI will become an Olympic host, just like a country. I don't know if we're due an Olympics this year: Sebastian Coe won't return my calls. But I will totally host it single-handedly. I might not have stadiums (the correct plural of which is \"stadiumii\"), but I can run around my living room in jogging bottoms balancing an egg in a ladle. Not a real egg, obviously, I'm not stupid.Resolution 6Become the world's tallest manI'll just stand on some bricks or something.Resolution 7Win all the marathonsAll of them. London, Munich, Sydney, Bhutan, everywhere. Eddie Izzard did loads of marathons because standup comedians run about a lot on stage, so it was a natural progression. I don't want to do any actual running: I'm pretty sure if you bung the finish-line marshals a few quid, they'll plant a few bogus \"this way\" signs so my competitors get lost and/or fall into a crocodile pit.Resolution 8Become 'Back Flip Guy'Just imagine. I'm in a board meeting. Some suit is pointing at figures on a white board. The big boss at the head of the table asks for blue-sky thinking. I do a back flip right out of my chair, and everyone says it's \"well skill\" while doing the gangsta hand-snap thing. Hey! I'm the Back Flip Guy! It's what I do! See also: AA meetings, supermarket queues, rollercoasters, egg-ladle racing.Resolution 9Invent Star WarsDo you know how much money Star Wars made? It was like a thousand pounds or something. I'm going to get rich by inventing Star Wars, although I'd get rid of all those little furry animals and the droopy-faced racist guy and all the robots and anything to do with space. It's basically going to be a dozen films of me sat in my pants playing computer Solitaire. The merch is going to be amazing.Resolution 10Use the word \"horse\" instead of other more useful wordsMy final resolution is going to horse your brain. I'm going to horse a seventy-foot horse in front of a crowd of horse, while horse-rope walking across a huge chasm which is horse metres high. Everyone will totally horse, and within horse weeks, horse will ask me to horse a horse, with horse horse and horse. Horse horse ladle, horse, horse on horse horse.

{"title": "Best electronic albums of 2020: one", "date": "Dec 31, 2020", "text": "1 – DJ Python – Mas Amable (Incienso)I know what I want in a number one album. I want fat chunky chords dancing for my pleasure, or Aphexian ambience dripping over the sides, or drum machines that seem out of control, or cool samples that I can make into memes or...I did not expect Mas Amable. Nobody expected Mas Amable.What an astonishing piece of work. This is the second album produced for Anthony Naples' Incienso imprint by DJ Python, who is a person and not a snake. There's little in his techno discography that suggests that one day he'd come up with an album so beguiling, it renders any concept of track listing meaningless. It's like you're listening to a secret album beyond what's laid out in front of you.Mas Amable is a reggaeton album (Python calls it \"deep reggaeton\"). The unmistakable rhythm conjures images of sunny beaches and palm trees, yet Python uses this as a basis for something quite unique. Is it eight tracks? Is it one long track? Is it three tracks if you squint your eyes hard enough? The beats occupy some ethereal moon, and your mind is a pebble being washed by the tide.It starts in an ambient haze, until that ubiquitous rhythm tumbles in. The drums begin to morph, not that you notice. A third of the way into the album, wistful IDM chords appear. They rarely venture beyond variations of the same triptych, and indeed it's a three-chord structure that subtly begins and ends the album, albeit at different tempos.When the spoken word comes, you're so deep in the Mas Amable spell, you don't notice the darkness of the lyrics: \"It's okay to feel hopeless because the world is hopeless. It's okay to think about dying.\" I can feel the universe falling away around me.She also says, \"Where was the place where you felt okay? Go to this place.\"Throughout this countdown, I've said that there isn't much that separates the the briefest of 'special mentions' and the top level of my list. Such was the quality of albums this year. But it was always going to be Mas Amable for the top spot. There's nothing else like it.We are all unique snowflakes, and this is the snowflakest of them all.I know what I want in a number one album, but I'm wrong. This album has shown me something different. I've gone to the restaurant expecting my usual hot-flagged chicken and fries. But the waiter has shown me a plate of delicious steaming fog that is on, but not quite on, the plate and I really want that fog, and now the fog is telling me to find my happy place because the world is a mess and is it one fog or three fogs and I squint my eyes and I wonder if it tastes like pea soup.Addendum: I've just found out that Boomkat also selected this as their top album of 2020. They called it a \"mutable organism imperceptibly transforming before our eyes\". This is very okay, Boomers.Congratulations to DJ Python.

{"title": "Best electronic albums of 2020: two", "date": "Dec 31, 2020", "text": "2 – Kelly Lee Owens – Inner Song (Smalltown Supersound)Ooo, it's a corker. If you've not fallen for Inner Song yet, do it now. Listen to it. Eat it. Bathe in it. Tattoo it on your face.Previously, I've rather brashly compared Inner Song to Leftfield's Leftism, not because of its sound, but because of its eclectic approach to production. In the same way Leftfield embraced dub reggae shanties alongside hard house, Kelly Lee Owens' second album encompasses soulful vocals, wall-shaking club cuts, and every frequency inbetween. I have no doubt that if this album had been released in the mid-90s, it would have been a go-to coffee table album just like Leftism.She uses this variation as structure. There's a pin-ball nature to the track listing, volleying between sugar soft vocals and aerobic techno workouts. It's like watching a tennis match between Betty Boop and Mr Motivator. And Owens nails every return because she's possibly the most talented producer in Britain at the moment.There are two headline moments on Inner Song. The first is her buzzy Radiohead cover Arpeggi. The second is her collaboration with fellow Welsh musician John Cale, whose druggy drawl on Corner Of My Sky was described by James Spearing at Picky B*stards as \"the best thing anyone from the Velvet Underground has done since 1972\".On any other album, those two remarkable moments would be the things you remember the most. Not here. Everything else is so dang brilliant. The descending synth on Melt! The euphoria of Jeanette. The the cheeky bass drum nudging its way into On. Whether it pounds or patters or pumps or purrs, each track has an, erm, inner song you'll want to play again and again.Small print: please do not tattoo this album on your face.Inner Song by Kelly Lee Owens Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 20203 – Mason Bee – Play Flights (Pollen Kit)The popular techno band Plaid built up a formidable reputation over the years, playing cool beats on their disco machines to Orbital and The Black Dog fans. \"That chord sequence sounds a bit off,\" we'd yell over the music, and we'd love it.What many of their fans don't know is that throughout their career, they've been accompanied by a bee. It was often hard to see, what with the mirrorballs and dry ice, but the techno band Plaid wouldn't be seen anywhere without their busy little bee.There have been a few close calls at their live gigs. The Southbank Centre has a particularly aggressive air conditioning system, and they nearly had their bee sucked off. There was also a near miss once, backstage with DJ Food and a rolled-up newspaper. But generally, their bee— oh hold on—Apparently, it's a person. Not a bee. Sorry. Should have checked, I suppose. Please ignore everything I have written so far.Benet 'Mason Bee' Walsh has been a key part of Plaid forever, with so much of their sound defined by his plaintive guitars. Now he has stepped into the solo spotlight for this delightful instrumental album. It's folky, it's gentle, it's quite 70s. But this is the guy from Plaid, and THOSE chords and THAT signature bite is present. There's so much going on. I fell for this album in a big way.I've banged on about Play Flights for Electronic Sound, saying he's \"taken the harmony from Plaid and drizzled it in honey\" before dropping the necessary cheesy line that this was \"the bee's knees\". For Picky B*stards, I said it \"evokes pastoral fields, sunny afternoons in the ‘70s, and picnics in slightly-alien forests\" before going on about poop too much.What I haven't explained is the emotional tug this album has for me. When Covid hit, my world turned briefly upside-down. I didn't cope with the stress, and although I was lucky enough to be able to pivot my job in events, things got very wonky quickly. Yes, I know, boo-hoo me, let's all get out our tiny violins! I do realise I've had things easy.However, just before that hit, I was caning this album, Like, proper Spotify Wrapped caning. And that's relevant. Because when I think back to the \"normal times\", this album is the soundtrack. When I listen to Play Flights, I feel a mixture of comfort and grief. For that reason, and because of the cracking noises Mason Bee makes, this album makes me wibble when I listen to it.Yep. Crying at a bee. This is what I have become.play flights by mason bee Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 2020Throughout this countdown, I have herded many albums into a pen labelled \"special mentions\". Here is the final lot of special mentions for you to ogle longingly at. Oh and my notebook tells me the following selections are labelled \"pop / chart\".I've always had a soft spot for Moby, and although it got mixed reviews, I enjoyed All Visible Objects (Mute), especially its nod to his younger rave days. Speaking of feeling young, there was a fresh energy to Disclosure's third album Energy (Island), all chart-friendly and chirpy and cheesy smiles. I've never fully got Sparks: the quirkiness is lost on me. That said, there was a lot to admire in A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip (BMG), with my Electronic Sound review praising their wryness, lyricism and \"earworms with moustaches\". Another duo I got to review in 2020 was Erasure. Their eighteenth (!) album The Neon (Mute) was a \"glittery cannon of anthems\", in which the \"neon flickers with regret\".I always love a Pet Shop Boys album. Early in the year, they released Hotspot (x2), revisiting subtler melodies and giving us the prophetic stay-at-home anthem I Don't Wanna. Nice to see Years & Years making an appearance (the band not the television programme) (obviously) (duh).Another bunch of old party-heads releasing an album in 2020 was The Orb. Abolition of the Royal Familia (Cooking Vinyl) was a likeable jumble of soulful pop and dubby ambience, and featured the usual gang (Eno! Youth! Hillage!) alongside tributes to Stephen Hawking and Jello from the Dead Kennedys. This was, by the way, only their seventeenth album. I can hear Erasure's mocking laughter.Finally, pop-pickers, there's this wacky pairing. Eccentric knob-twiddler and Sigur Ros collaborator Dan Deacon gave us Mystic Familiar (Domino Recordings), his first album since 2015. It had DIY songwriting, crashing drums, wonky electronics, and an anthem or three. And eccentric sample-fiddlers The Avalanches were back with We Will Always Love You (Astralwerks), which they said was an “exploration of the vibrational relationship between light, sound and spirit” although was much more straight-laced than that.I think that's it for my special mentions.

I once thwacked my head getting out of a car and didn't say \"ouch\" for about ten seconds. My friends who witnessed the incident mentioned that odd response gap for a while afterwards. Fat Roland: he's got lazy neurons.Home is a stupendously relaxed album. These infectious mid-paced head-nodders lay out like origami unicorns being unfolded by a sloth. Even on bangers such as Sunshine, the lead melody lopes. Should music lope? It does here. At the album's most euphoric moment, the choppy chords of High, we're on an afternoon stroll of 90bpm.That's not to say it's without its dramatic moments. That first sluggish piano drop. That first seismic bass drop. Often the lack of a drop. The detuned suspense of You See. The half-cooked vocal samples sprinkled throughout, climaxing with that amazing vocal grunt on Heaven. A hint of blues and soul flavouring everything. And wood blocks. Nice to hear some wood blocks.I'm pretty sure a saxophone appears at one point, but it disappears after half a second: I'm not sure it's heard again. That's the key to Home: dropping in ideas, but holding them back. Creativity through restraint. Romare has taken primary colour tropes – over-simplistic melodies and obvious build-ups – and transformed it into casual tribal techno that I'll be listening to for years. Half the success was simply loading his workstation and mousing down that BPM count.One positive side of 2020 is that it has been, for some, a year of slowing down. Destressing. Thwacking that head and not worrying about the pain for a while. There's no better accompanying soundtrack than Home.Home by Romare Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 20205 – Rival Consoles – Articulation (Erased Tapes)Rumour has it Mr Consoles graphs out his tracks before composing them, like Charlie with his conspiracy theory board in It's Alway Sunny In Philadelphia. Apparently he's also scribbled ideas on napkins, like politicians trying to fix a vote.However he preps, Articulation is more than just a carefully planned loud-quiet aesthetic. Listen to the sorrowful squawks of the melody in Still Here. The stretched saws of Vibrations On A String, all wistful and woebegone. Oh my heart.This is probably his most soundtrack-y album yet: a snatch of harpsichord comes and goes, gentle strings ripple in the background, a light brush here, a ghostly woosh there. \"Rival Consoles\" suggests a battle, but this is more intimate than that: \"Friendly Consoles\" maybe, or \"Hugging For A Little Bit Too Long Consoles\".We're in the final five of my countdown now, and honestly this album has been yo-yoing up and down my top ten like a trampolinist's testicles. But it was always going to be top ten because this is a sonic world I want to live in forever. It ticks my 'Jon Hopkins box'. And apparently, it's all planned out, like a terrorist attack or a day trip to Whitby.Other possible names:\"Pen-Pal Consoles\"\"Passive Aggressive Consoles\"\"Only Speaking Through Lawyers Consoles\"\"I Couldn't Have Partied Because I Medically Can't Sweat Consoles\"\"Viral Consoles\"Articulation by Rival Consoles Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 20206 – Shinichi Atobe – Yes (DDS)Before we get stuck into this album, take a look at the photo at the bottom of this blog post.Shinichi Atobe's new album arrived at Demdike Stare's Manchester headquarters on a CD-R, sent from Japan, accompanied by the track listing and this photograph. That's it. Nothing else.He remains an international man of mystery. The music is easier to figure out: simplistic house tracks, ripples of rhythm, playfully basic melodies, structures that are stillwater-smooth, repetition that verges on mind control. Easy.If I delivered these blog posts like Atobe delivers his albums, I'd be in trouble. \"Fat Roland's shoving crayon-scrawled toilet roll through the letterbox again, and why's he included a photograph of his only nipple?\"But then, these blog posts are scrappy, first-drafty. Yes, however, is perfection.

{"title": "Best electronic albums of 2020: these special mentions will not be intimidated by a mop", "date": "Dec 30, 2020", "text": "It's time for a penultimate set of special mentions, consisting of albums I flipping loved but couldn't find space for in my final Top 25.This lot are filed in my notes as, and I quote, \"jungle / dirty\". As with previous notes, it's a misnomer. All of the \"jungle\" is drum 'n' bass. And it's hardly dirty: it's not as if I'm going to sloosh this lot with a mop to make them sound better.Calibre rummaged in his archives yet again for Shelflife Six (Signature) a selection of sharp-suited soulful drum 'n' bass pleasers. Really good fun, and a superb entry album if you're investigating the busy beats of d&b music. On similar lines, the ever-reliable J Majik produced another corker in the form of Always Be (Infrared), his breezy Bukem sounds delivered with a warm hug (copyright Electronic Sound issue umpteen).dgoHn's Undesignated Proximate (Love Love Records) was a darker drum 'n' bass listen, but no less liquid. It's just the liquid was a heavily fortified sherry rather than oil: just listen to that woozy swagger of Robin's Windmill. It was great to see the return of Krust, member of Roni Size’s Reprazent's back in the day. The Edge of Everything (Crosstown Rebels) was a thrilling listen: lots of robust rolling beats with synths so threatening, you half expect them to pounce on you the moment you drop your guard.Moving away from drum 'n' bass now. I suppose this is the \"dirty\" stuff. Pinch's astonishing new album was, as I wrote in one review, \"UK bass music with a nocturnal gloom\": the wobbling basslines on Reality Tunnels (Tectonic) seemed to emanate from somewhere deep in our psyche. Gábor Lázár's more minimal Source (Planet Mu) was equally bassy and wobbly, his cut-down production style playing ping-pong with frequencies with skilful abandon.Finally, Cylob was a busy bunny this year: one of the albums he put out was the squelchy One Less Pitch (Cylob Industries) with acid so corrugated, you could make it into a shed. It's a strangely tense listen, but then again everything's strangely tense, so I'm not complaining. *mops self*Shelflife Six by Calibre J Majik - Always Be by Infrared RecordsBrowse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 20207 – Plone– Puzzlewood (Ghost Box)hello my name is baby fat roland and i like pooping my pants and putting lego up my nosei like the sounds of plone's puzzlewood because some of it sounds like children's television and some of it sounds like speak & spell and some of it sounds like a 1970s sitcom montage and some of it sounds like catsapparently it has been two decades since plone did anything, not that i know what a decade is because am a baby and i've barely grasped the concept of timeplone has taken the naïve novelty of 1999's playschool-flavoured for beginner piano and bolstered it with some serious tunesmithery and library music nous, for example watson's telescope is such a cheery earworm (a \"cheerworm\" if you will)with puzzlewood highlights like the proggy mini-disco of day trip or the chaotic mario-run that is sarcelle, the baby really has grown upwhat do these words even mean? i have a limited concept of language Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 2020"},

Jeez, Mr Bulb, give it a BREAK.I'm guilty of neglecting The Flashbulb's work for a long time. He last got a mention on this website in 2006. ‎So the cinematic, perfectly programmed and endlessly creative Our Simulacra came as something of a revelation. The sheer range of ideas wins the day. The choral and darkly comic Stabmyself is worth the album price alone. The title track sounds like recent Daft Punk caught in a malfunctioning Faraday cage. And he's not afraid of a bit of cheese either, as the liquid piano in Ez God Library shows. Very well played cheese.Hi, I'm Flash.

Pfffrt.Our Simulacra by The Flashbulb Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 20209 – Autechre – Sign (Warp)It was a shame to see Autechre throw away their credibility with an album comprising entirely of cover versions of Ace Of Bass's 1993 hit single The Sign. We forgave them their Nickelback phase, but this was too far.See what I did there? I did a joke. I'll pause for a moment to leave you time to laugh... Right. Let's get on with it.Autechre's 14th album Sign saw the duo on a lower burn than usual, their abstractions suspended in a lovely fuzz of ambience or, at the very least, confusing and scary reverberations. For me, playing this at home felt like casting a magical protection spell against the loneliness of autumn lockdowns.It was certainly evocative. si00 sounded like Actress trapped in a hamster ball. Metaz form8 sounded like a church service populated entirely by bees. By the way, post-Covid, I am going to make both of these things happen.Next up, I want to hear covers of Dr Alban's 1992 single It's My Life. No wait, this is Autechre, that's too on the nose.

There has been a terrible administration error.\"Okay. How can I help fix it?\"Why have you left Four Tet out of the Top 25? Four Tet is meant to be in the Top 25.\"It's not an error. It's just that there were so many good albums, and it got squeezed out.\"This is unacceptable. You cannot leave Four Tet out of the Top 25. You're sacked.\"What? You can't...\"Clean out your desk. Gross dismissal. Never darken my doors again.\"But I'm you. You're sacking yourself. You've just lost your own job working for you.\"Er... Forget I said that. Here, have a promotion. Excellent work, Fat Roland.\"Thanks, Fat Roland.I did feel bad for only including Four Tet's Sixteen Oceans (Text Records) in my special mentions section, but that's how my sorting hat sorted things when compiling my final list. I loved this album: so many zippy earworms and such glistening oomph. I've not had a chance to listen to the two (two!) albums he dropped over Christmas, Parallel (Text Records) and 871 (Text Records).Here are even more special mentions, referred to as \"perky\" in my notebook. In Electronic Sound (yeah, I mention them a lot), I praised Moses Boyd for Dark Matter (Exodus Records) as he \"pinballs around his ever-present drum kit like an oiled whippet\". Kruder & Dorfmeister finally released their debut album 1995 (G-Stone Recordings), originally scheduled to be released in the year 1995 then, er, slightly delayed. The trip hop comeback you never knew you were waiting for.You want the best? You want the pin-sharp house energy of Omar S's You Want (FXHE Records): sassy, straightforward, and superbly executed, despite that overused sample. Improvised in a cave, Capitol K's mini-album Birdtrapper (Faith And Industry) was a delightfully curious mix of driving organic rhythms and bamboo. Wajatta released second album Don't Let Get You Down (Brainfeeder), with the irrepressible Reggie Watts performing vocal acrobatics (and whistling) over John Tejada's fast and funky house.Finally for this section, Black Nationalist Sonic Weaponry (Planet Mu), released under DeForrest Brown Jr's Speaker Music alias, sounded like the fierce heart of BlacKkKlansman pulsing to the rhythm of distended and shattered jazzy percussion experiments. An important album, but I've no idea why it's in this section: it's anything but \"perky\". Stupid notebook.Sixteen Oceans by Four Tet Dark Matter by Moses BoydBrowse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 202010 – Ital Tek – Outland (Planet Mu)We start the top ten an act I called \"ambimum\" in my 2016 top ten and compared to Stockport in my 2018 top ten. With yet another top ten entry, Ital Tek has done it again – and may well have scored higher than previous years if there hadn't been such competition in 2020. Not that this is a competition. Ahem.Outland starts quietly, like a boxing match with a baby tiger. \"This is easy,\" you think, as the baby fur flies. Soon the snarling begins; the muscles flex, and before long you have a furious tiger and/or pulsing analogue synths sitting on your face.This is his most accessible album despite some naaaasty bass moments. Such is the analogue perfection, it really does feel like you're being destroyed by something cute. The apocalypse has never sounded so graceful.Outland has the grimy thump of Clark cushioned by the murky otherworld of Stranger Things; it has the crowd-hyping drops of Jon Hopkins or Hudson Mohawke almost completely flattened into a biophilic Bjorkian fuzz. So good.No baby tigers were hurt in the writing of this blog post, apart from the one I fired out of a cannon, but that was just for fun.Outland by Ital Tek Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 202011 – Lorenzo Senni – Scacco Matto (Warp)There's a wonderful moment in The Queen's Gambit where Beth Harmon is chatting to Jolene in the orphanage, and suddenly Beth sees something on the ceiling. In the space above them, an apparition appears of a moustachioed Italian grinding the gears of a battered synthesiser while shouting \"I'M DECONSTRUCTING RAVE!\"I may be getting my 2020 chess entertainments mixed up because, yes, this is an album themed on chess. Scacco Matto is 'checkmate' in Italian. Lorenzo Senni launched the album with a virtual chess meet-up. And it's as loud and as brilliantly garish as the wallpaper designs in The Queen's Gambit.Senni eschews percussion, often reducing his tools to one single instrument. He's a man that loves a JP-8000, the synth I'm named after. However, that doesn't stop everything feeling maxed out. The cleaved EDM of Discipline of Enthusiasm punches hard. The single-finger melody of THINK BIG is as power pop as it gets.As with chess, it's an acquired taste. But if you like your music \"full of melodramatic bombast filtered through the smallest Gameboy in the world\" (as I wrote in 2017), then make a move on Scacco Matto. As long as that move is two forwards and one across.Scacco Matto by Lorenzo Senni Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 202012 – Squarepusher – Be Up A Hello (Warp)At this stage of the countdown, the variation in quality is so small, you can pretty much consider the top 12 as one long Album Of The Year. Maybe it comes as one humongous CD that you have to roll into your living room, or a single cassette tape the size of a washing machine. That's how box sets work, right?Be Up A Hello is one of Squarepusher's best albums. It's melodic yet acerbic, warming yet acerbic, thrilling yet acerbic. Detroit People Mover is a sweet moment of stillness in a storm of clattering dynamics, breathless melancholy, and really flipping good noises. I love it.The album also came from a tough place: an accident nearly saw the end of Squarepusher's career, and he had to rebuild his process from the ground up. Read about this in my interview with Squarepusher in Electronic Sound issue 62. An interview conducted, by the way, after I'd suffered a similar accident. We were both smarting.I enjoyed the 'Pusher's collaboration with Japanese speed robots, and the LED-bright prog funk as Shobaleader, but his move towards older synth kit really paid off here. Ole Squiggleplops has done good.Be Up A Hello by Squarepusher Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 2020Let's look at some more \"special mentions\", that awkward category of album which I profess to love but I still excluded from my Top 25. It's like saying you love your cat, but you eat all the Dreamies yourself. Tasty.Let's start with Shadow of Fear (Mute), the first album for 26 years from Cabaret Voltaire. This newly solo incarnation had corroded industrial teeth: apparently the H in Richard H Kirk stands for Hardcore. Incidentally, read me raving about Kirk's Virtual State album, although I make it sound much cuter than it is.This clutch of albums is among notes labelled \"thoughtful\". I swear I was on meth when I made these lists. I suppose there was something thoughtful in the sound of Req, who made his comeback with Calypso Dark (Seagrave), spinning out deeply beaty trippy sound-soups. Even more introspective was the dub-heavy sound system vibes of Al Wootton's infectious Witness (TRULE). A wonderful listen. \"Come!\"Robert Hood has been pumping out the tunes these past few years, and he outdid himself on the metronomic assault that was Mirror Man (Rekids). His muscular minimalism is always produced with thought, but there was an extra frisson of meaning in track titles like Nothing Stops Detroit, Fear Not and Ignite A War. Speaking of minimalism, The Black Dog never seem to stop producing, and it was nice to see them taking a more simplistic approach for their Patreon-produced Fragments (Dust Science). Ambient abstraction with a tonne of heart.Roy Of The Ravers is usually know for his sprawling acid workouts, so the distinctly non-acid retrospective White Line Sunrise II (Emotional Response) was an atmospheric, reflective, ambient treat – Bounc Erec is the softest of anthems. And if you need even more atmosphere, Clark's Daniel Isn’t Real OST (Deutsche Grammophon) had sotto piano in severe distress alongside apocalyptic strings worthy of its horror film source material.Is that the end of the special mentions? Nope. Loads more to come. Flipping loads, mate.Shadow of Fear by Cabaret Voltaire Calypso Dark by REQ Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 2020"},

That's in case I drop one on the way home, and another accidentally gets stolen by a wolf. Logical, when you think about it.I can only assume that was Luke Vibert's logic when he released three albums, called Luke Vibert Presents Amen Andrews, Luke Vibert Presents Modern Rave and Luke Vibert Presents Rave Hop. This trio of treats were dedicated to, respectively, old school jungle, early rave, and hip hop / breakbeat. For the purposes of this albums countdown, I've mushed them into one.Although Vibert goes for a particular palate in his music (day-glo rave cut and pasted for your dancefloor pleasure), this trilogy gave us three distinct flavours. Amen Andrews, heavily based on the famous drum sample, had a full-on hardcore edge. Modern Rave felt like Altern-8 having a stroke, in a good way.It's perhaps the strollin' vibes of the more relaxed Rave Hop that wins the day: it's mangling of hip hop and r'n'b is a pleasure to behold, and there are techno tunes galore. But to be honest, if a wolf came for any of these, or indeed the Vibert album I featured at number eighteen, I would punch it on the nose.

{"title": "Best electronic albums of 2020: fourteen", "date": "Dec 29, 2020", "text": "14 – Against All Logic – 2017–2019 (Other People)Nicolas Jaar, who has previously had two albums mentioned in this countdown, is already known for warping 1970s soul and disco into something thoroughly techno under this Against All Logic guise. 2017-2019, however, takes it to a new level.He's taken all that lovely dance music you love, then shoved it through a waste disposal, attacked it with a sander, and bashed any remaining bits with a hammer. It distorts, it belches, it scrapes, it thrills. It's the red-peaking bit of early Daft Punk but, y'know, forever.It's way rougher than you'd expect from a Jaar album. It's like your smooth Uncle Thackery, the one with the Lambo and the winning smile, turning up at your door in a half-open dressing gown, sweet wrappers stuck in his lockdown hair. Not the Thackery you expect, but certainly a Thackery you'll come to like.2017-2019 also contains... and I'm going to whisper this because we don't want everyone knowing ... it also contains, in opening track Fantasy, the best Beyoncé song you'll hear in 2020. There, I said it. Uncle Thackery, can you please put on some pants? Jeez.2017 - 2019 by Against All Logic Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 202015 – Daniel Avery –  Love + Light (Phantasy Sound)I was really looking forward to seeing Daniel Avery at the Orbit Stage at Bluedot Festival this year. I would be there with my little pink tent, Ugg boots, chocolate fountain, Scalextric set, a full-size Victorian wardrobe: all the camping essentials.Instead, his third album Love + Light can only point towards the live experience incanted in its thrumming bass drums, electrostatic basslines and machine-smoked synths, then, later in the running order, the pastoral glows of a post-club sunrise.The great thing about this album is that the loud, thumpy club tracks don't carry the album on their own, although we all love a pumping loop in the face. It needs the softer tracks, and there's a beautiful moment somewhere between A Story In E5 and One More Morning when the spirit of early Aphex lands on this album and gives it a blessing.Incidentally, you can watch Avery's set from Bluedot's A Weekend in Outer Space. Which reminds me, I mustn't forget to take my 42-inch plasma screen next time I'm camping.Love + Light by Daniel Avery Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 2020Alright. I can see that you're tense. There are even more special mentions on the way, but it's stressing you out. Here, lie on this sofa. Let me fluff up these cushions. Put on this soothing face cream. Let Igor give you one of his aggressive massages.And now let's listen to the ambient-flecked sounds of some more albums that didn't quite make the final Top 25.The Soft Pink Truth's Shall We Go On Sinning So That Grace May Increase? (Thrill Jockey) had critics raving, and I can see why, with its ambient house tantalisingly preserved in amber then washed across a million tides. A less intense and more synthy version of this could be found with the hypnotic Erratics & Unconformities (The Leaf Label) from Craven Faults: its 17-minute opening loop Wacca Wall was a giddy trip.Com Truise dug out a bunch of old, sepia-washed tracks for In Decay, Too (Ghostly International), a follow-up to a similar retrospective back in 2012: let that fuzzy neon tickle your analogue taste buds. If someone switched Com Truise off, and all we had was a momentary glow of what had been before, then we'd have The Spectral Isle (Castles in Space) by Field Lines Cartographer – an ambient masterpiece that had the best textures of 2020 and was also the year's best phantom island-themed album.While we're in an ambient mood, it's worth listening to Eartheater's Phoenix: Flames Are Dew Upon My Skin (PAN), a gorgeous swell of classical ambience workshopped at an artistic residency in northeastern Spain. Or if you want to get really spaced out, then opt for the short choral apparitions of Healing Is a Miracle (Ninja Tune) by Julianna Barwick.And finally let's lift things up again with John Beltran's brilliant The Season Series (Delsin Records), which takes ambience as its starting point but then spreads wings fashioned from shards of Detroit techno and crystalline percussion. Mmmm, feels relaxing. HARDER, Igor, HARDER.Shall We Go On Sinning So That Grace May Increase? by The Soft Pink TruthErratics & Unconformities by Craven Faults Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 202016 – Nathan Fake – Blizzards (Cambria Instruments)For this entry in the 2020 album countdown, we go over to our reporter Fat Roland. Fats, can you hear us?    \"Yes, I can, Fat Roland.\"Fat Roland, what can you tell us about Nathan Fake's fifth and best album?    \"Erm. Nothing much.\"What? Oh. I thought you were going to tell us about Blizzards.\"Don't really like music, sorry.\"Apologies, viewers, we seem to have a technical fault, in that Fat Roland is technically an idiot. Instead, we can cut to this piece Fat Roland wrote for the Picky B*stards website:\"The cracking thing about Nathan Fake’s Blizzards is that it does all the best albums at once. The breakbeats of Cry Me A Blizzard have the nostalgic giddiness of Octo Octa.... North Brink seems to blend the icy hi-hats of Shinichi Atobe’s Yes with the melted warmth of Khotin’s Finds You Well to make a temperature that’s, erm, just right.... Blizzards works on its own terms too, powered by a frustrated energy, its rhythms rising from the foundations of the clubs we no longer go to.\"Even it did drop down my Best Of 2020 list since I wrote that piece (read it in full here), Nathan Fake is on his best form here.Blizzards by Nathan Fake Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 202017 –  Minor Science – Second Language (AD 93)I love editing. I love manhandling a bulging mess of words then chopping until it's as good as it can be. These blog posts are not that: they are largely first draft. This countdown isn't just a mess: it's its own ecosystem of circuitously prolix overwriting and needlessly unnecessary adverbs.However, there is something of the editor's eye in Minor Science's debut album. This former Resident Advisor writer has precision-cut every section of Second Language: each growl, each rolling chord, each echoing chime, each vocal grunt.The sudden cough in the filmic intro gives us notice of what is to come. This is a hugely listenable melodic IDM album, dripping with atmosphere, and full of complex trills and stops. Equally beguiling yet immediate.The album also gives us For Want Of Gelt, one of the best tunes of 2020. A slow build-up leads into pneumatic shimmers and finally the most furious – and funniest – drum-fills. You see: structured, like writing. That was a loop back to the opening paragraph, by the way. It's what proper writers do. I thank you. *takes a bow*Second Language by Minor Science Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 2020Let's visit some more special mentions: albums which didn't make the top 25 but are well worth a listen. \"But Fat Roland,\" you wibble, \"I've not finished the special mentions from yesterday.\" Well, it's not MY fault you filled up on leftover mince pies instead, IS IT. Now eat your special mentions. No, you may not borrow the ketchup.I had this bunch filed under \"woozy\", and although I don't think that's an accurate description, they certainly transport us somewhere interesting. Actress's Karma and Desire (Ninja Tune), featuring vocals from Mercury winner Sampha, saw the beat-wobbler in a more ambient mode: the smoke rising from the nightclub vents rather than the club itself. The return of Darkstar with Civic Jams (Warp) placed us squarely under the stage lights, their burning siren songs feeling as elemental as ever, thrumming with (Wu) life. The bouncing bass and smokin' electronics of Fritz von Runte's The Last Album (Marshall Records) brought a cracking space jam to 2020, so fresh and so clean: it had Graham Massey and Bill Drummond on audio and word duties respectively. An album with a similar quirky independent feel was Magic Oneohtrix Point Never (Warp) from, you guessed it, Oneohtrix Point Never. However, I was less convinced by the weird processed nature of Oneohtrix's ninth album, especially those vocals. One-y needs to borrow some guest vocalists from Fritz.Speaking of vocals, Lyra Pramuk's voice on Fountain (Bedroom Community) was processed to heckery, and to tremendous effect. Comprising only her vocals, Fountain was an engrossing and unique work, and it feels like a crime to not include this in the Top 25. Seriously, give it a listen. Not so much in-the-club as outside the club listening to the queue chatter but slowed down a thousand times.What's left in this little pile? Ah yes, there was Matmos's epic The Consuming Flame: Open Exercises in Group Form (Thrill Jockey), which was three hours of bizarre 99bpm electronics with 99 collaborators, including Matthew Herbert, the aforemented Oneohtrix and Andi from Mouse on Mars. As PC Danny Butterman once said, this is \"off the fricking chain\". And finally, let's get back to woozy: Beatrice Dillon debut album Workaround (PAN) embraced the obscure, the minimal beats existing in some otherplace: not so much a nightclub as a cubist impression of a nightclub.There are plenty more special mentions to come. Gobble them up. Gobble them right up.Karma & Desire by Actress Civic Jams by DarkstarBrowse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 202018 – Wagon Christ – Recepticon (People of Rhythm Records)Wagon Christ used to be everywhere. He'd spout his daft block-rockin' beats, and us disciples would follow in his sandals, witnessing his miracles, lapping up his communion wafers, er, nuzzling his Jesus beard, um, I think I've lost control of this metaphor.Recepticon is the long-awaited return of Luke Vibert's experimental moniker, which was originally a Rising High ambient project but quickly became the go-to name for accessible experimental dance music. It gave me instant flashbacks to my DJing days in the 1990s: the speed breaks of 1998's Lovely were a delight to mix.So we have wonky downbeat, loping grooves, fat acid, party samples (\"Hello, everybody!\") and self-referential track titles like Boogie Serious and Special Designer Song. He throws it all into the bag then empties out a rag-tag jumble of retro fun. It's Wagon Christ at his best.Come O Wagon Christ. Fill us with your loaves and fish. Let us exalt you by, erm, signing up to the church newsletter. Let us do something with a hassock even though we're not quite sure what it is. Crikes, these Jesus metaphors really are adding nothing.Recepticon by Wagon Christ by Wagon Christ Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 202019 – Dangerw*nk – Your Card Has Been Declined (Salmon Universe)I've starred out part of Dangerw*nk's name because I'm pretty sure Blogger still has some unforgiving filters. Which is a shame, because the only danger here is listening to this album then exploding with sheer electronic joy.Your Card Has Been Declined was the leftfield surprise of the year. In Electronic Sound magazine, I called this \"Ulrich Schnauss for an Instagram generation\". Bright electronic anthem after bright electronic anthem. I even liked the saxophone.And what anthems. Woman Laughing Alone With Salad is a chocolate-sprinkled Sakamoto. An Attractively Priced Two Bedroom Flat In A Sought After Location is a new-born Plone, full of possibilities for the future. And yes, those are the real titles.I do wonder if this album stayed under the radar for some people because of the ungoogleable name. Which would be a pity because this is an absolute d*light, a bright shining st*r in a dark year.

{"title": "Best electronic albums of 2020: welcome to my Special Mentions Block Party, whatever that is", "date": "Dec 28, 2020", "text": "Here are yet more special mentions, comprising albums I really liked but couldn't squeeze into my final top 25 despite purchasing several shoe horns.This selection is themed along the lines of \"albums I would play at a block party\". I have no idea what a block party is. The only parties I've been to are children's, acid house, political and raiding. But let's imagine we're dropping some bangers and the people are going ham. Let's go.People are arriving at the party: this DJ needs to press play on some tunes. Machinedrum's ninth album A View Of U (Ninja Tune) was one of his strongest, with slow jams and drum machine smashers galore. While the cloakroom cue is bopping to this, I've also popped on Hudson Mohawke's BBHE (Warp), a lively bag of unreleased works that serves as Machinedrum's wackier, dirtier cousin.To add a unique party atmosphere, I'm now playing Arca's Kick i (XL Recordings), although in typical Arca fashion her work here is not so much bangers as scrapers and writhers and awkwardly diagonal wibblers. Maybe I can save the atmosphere with Tricky's Fall To Pieces (False Idols), his fourteenth album and a welcome return to form due in no small part to his brilliant vocalist Marta. Actually, probably a little dark for a party. Bad DJ choice, but good album.The partiers are helping themselves to punch. Do they have punch at block parties? Anyway, I'm now spinning Two Fingers' Fight! Fight! Fight! (Nomark) with Amon Tobin in full corrugated-bass mode. Every track is a digitally-decayed dance-off: it's brilliant. Oh no. People are leaving. They want the new Steps album. How about Rian Treanor's second album File Under UK Metaplasm (Planet Mu), which sounds like a rave in the middle of Mike Teavee's fractal transfer in Charlie And The Chocolate Factory? No? Perhaps I can salvage things with upsammy's Zoom (Dekmantel) which takes a mirrorball to IDM and transforms it into an intricate alien sunrise.No?Sigh. Stupid imaginary block party.A View of U by Machinedrum B.B.H.E. by Hudson MohawkeBrowse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 202020 – Khotin – Finds You Well (Ghostly International)Do the Boards of Canada androids dream of electronic music? And when they do, does it sound like this Edmonton producer's super-hazy take on detuned downbeat? Or do they just have nightmares where they're in school assembly without their pants? Probably the latter.Khotin's Finds You Well is possibly the most likeable album on my list. If it popped round for dinner, I'd let it beat me on the Playstation then let it into the garden to jump on my trampoline. It's a huggable nostalgic treat, and very much the opposite to a terrible 2020.In once sense, you've heard this before: my opening reference was quite deliberate. Plaintive head-nodders meet pining analogue synths and scratchy vocal samples, all with a healthy element of fuzz. But it's incredibly well done.During one moment of dying ambience, Khotin's kid sister appears, sing-songing \"the world is wonderful\".  I can't help feeling that Finds You Well doesn't sound like an album we want right now: it sounds like the album we need.Finds You Well by Khotin Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 202021 – nthng – Hypnotherapy (Lobster Theremin)\"Yeah.\" Such a great start to Hypnotherapy. It starts with floating ambience, then suddenly from the heart of the Bronx some bad boy goes \"yeah\". It stops you in your tracks. nthng is going to be quite smthng, er I mean, something.This Dutch producer's second album treads a delicate line between spacey trance and off-kilter ambience. Sonorous dub techno rises from unseen foundations, rattles the walls with thunderous echoes, raises the roof a thousand times over. And then it flattens out and lets the dubbiness take over.Most remarkable is the album's climactic moment. It's not a warehouse banger, but instead is a slab of ocean-deep serenity called With You, constantly peppered with a fluttering \"just want to be with you\" vocal. So weird. And so good.Incidentally, that cover image is a close-up of the right eye of a bee-fly. Thanks to this Twitter conversation for pointing me towards the photograph. And here's more about the fly if you're into that kind of thing. That's right: you're learning about albums and little flappy things.Hypnotherapy LP by nthng Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 2020It's time for more special mentions: albums that didn't make it into my final 25, but definitely still deserve their own pool room with a dart board and one of those wheelie drinks trolleys that looks like a globe.I don't know what's gone wrong, but in the grand shuffling of my final list, Caribou's Suddenly (City Slang) fell out of the Top 25. I suppose it's quite floaty at times, but that's the point. It's Animal Collective meets Four Tet with an inflated head like Mr Mackey.Pantha du Prince did his twinkly organic thing on Conference of Trees (Modern Recordings): his best album for some time bolstered by his use of wooden instruments (poor trees!). I almost missed Lee Jones's Down Into Light (Mad As Hell), which would have been a shame because there's real emotional heft in his classical-infused minimalism. If Lee Jones is heaven, Luke Abbott is hell: Translate (Border Community), his first solo record for ages, had his trademark analogue smudges (even some laser zaps!) with his fat synths sounding like he was raising dark spirits. Lovely.There was much to admire in the splattery electronics of Call Super's third album Every Mouth Teeth Missing (Incienso), its chirrupy found-sounds adding an aural kaleidoscope in places. Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith's The Mosaic of Transformation (Ghostly International) sat somewhere between soft shoegaze and gentle process music, and was released as a peon to electricity. Finally for this section, ambient composer Nicolas Jaar released two albums, Telas (Other People) and Cenizas (Other People). They were rich and atmospheric and grand. Also, Jaar will get a lengthier mention later in this blog series.More special mentions on their way. I'm off to chop me some trees into instruments.

No, that's a xylophone. It's the one with the bars underneath. Yes, that's the one. Give it a clonk. Well clonked. The sound's a little insubstantial, isn't it. Welcome to the soft-touch world of K-Lone.Cape Cira is as feather light as cirrus clouds tickling the skies above tropical lakes. Its bass drums are faltering footsteps on hot sand. The album is ambient, the album is world music, but the album is also Detroit-inspired techno transplanted from the motor city to a seaside hut in the Bahamas then left to bleach in the sun.One online reviewer calls this 'Smooth FM in an African mood'. I'm not convinced by a comparison to a radio station that has voted Imagine, Careless Whisper and Ed Sheeran's snoozesome Perfect as its listeners' favourite songs. But there's definitely something soporific about Cape Cira.Just embrace it. It's slow, it's relaxing, it's quite gorgeous. Oh and don't forget to put the marimba back. It belongs to Alan Titchmarsh and we still owe him for ruining his alpine horn.K-LONE - Cape Cira LP by K-LONE Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 202023 – Hodge – Shadows In Blue (Houndstooth)This won't be the last time I'll make a reference to this, but it's testament to such a strong selection of 2020 albums that Shadows In Blue was, at one point, my number one bestest favourite of the year. And here it is at number 23.This was a long-awaited debut album of Bristol bass music from a very talented chap with a particular penchant for rattling your speakers to pieces. It's a party in a box: just unlock the lid and let it explode joyfully into your face.Shadows In Blue has the rolling corrugated melodies of Clark, the aerobic machinery of Kraftwerk, the glistening synth experimentalism of his Houndstooth labelmates, and a technological precision that makes this truly his own. What was Hodge's inspiration? Was it the dark corners of nightclubs now gathering cobwebs? Was it the rise of the robots, the sound of armageddon through automaton? No. It was growing vegetables. \"Gardening is something everyone can take part in,\" says Hodge in this interview about the album. Alas, it doesn't sound very Gardeners' Question Time-y.Shadows In Blue by Hodge Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 2020Throughout this countdown, there will be many albums that didn't make the final list but still deserve to be festooned with garlands and cocaine and fresh puppies. Welcome to the first selection of 'special mentions'.Firstly, I try not to include compilations in my Best Albums list, but I have to give a tip of the hat to the blistering Alterity from Houndstooth. In a piece of especially quality journalism, I described this album in Electronic Sound as sounding \"like a bunch of synth modules being chucked off a cliff. Like, properly chucked with a run-up and everything.\" That was meant to be a good thing.Another compilation worth a nod is PlanetMµ25. The sauciest thing to ever come out of Worcester, Mike Paradinas's Planet Mu celebrates its silver anniversary with some of my favourite artists, including Ital Tek, Gábor Lázár and Bogdan Raczynski. Right good treat.Back to artist albums. Here are some dark, dubby delights that deserve a special mention despite not making my final 25. Following rereleases of his early albums, it was great to get some glorious new glitch from Pole in Fading (Mute). This was utterly hypnotic, as was Recondite's haunting Dwell (Ghostly International), an album which took one minimal monotone and turned it into something as immersive as falling into a pool of Diet Pepsi (I really like Diet Pepsi).Let's also not forget Life Cycles (Cultivated Electronics), a lively collection of old rusted electro from the archives of Orbital’s early label-mates The Advent (1995's Elements of Life is still worth a listen). Finland's Morphology achieved a vintage feel too on the echoing electronics of Horta Proxima (FireScope Records). I'm amazed this didn't make my final 25. And finally, I loved the haze that emanated the smoked-out techno knees-up going on at the heart of Matt Karmil's ace STS371 (Smalltown Supersound).More special mentions to come. And more countdown to come. Stay tuned.Alterity by Various Artists Fading by Pole Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 202024 – John Frusciante – Maya (Timesig)On the Picky B*stards website, I called John Frusciante's album a \"tasty surprise\" while making some forced allusion to teapots and plop. No, seriously, give it a read. I also said it was \"Aphex Twin smushed with Squarepusher with all the energy of early Prodigy or Moby.\"That said, I was wrong in one particular aspect. Maya wasn't a surprise. JF had been twiddling knobs as Trickfinger for years, playing with drill 'n' bass and acid house. What was different here was the personal nature of the album prompted by the death of his cat Maya. Yep. It's a cat tribute album.This was Frusciante mastering the machines in a sound that was a million miles away from his Chili Peppers work or slapping a bunch of guitars over Mars Volta albums. He released it on Venetian Snares' Timesig label, which is as unCalifornicated as you could get.Best of all, this album gave us Brand E, a melacholic yet bouncy IDM anthem that was, hands down, one of the most replayable tracks of 2020.Maya by John Frusciante Browse the rest of the Best Electronic Albums of 2020"},

It's like someone's taken the roof off the club and let the light in.cocon also reminds me of a Drum Club smothered in gauze: for example, there's definitely a techno party going on in nos enfants and mutation, but it's tickled by ambience or sat on by a marshmallow monster.

When they arrive, they will hit you thick and fast: imagine being in a food fight but your opponent has all the food. I'm going to blog you in the mouth until you vomit.That paragraph made me quite hungry until it got disgusting.In 2020, lockdown days spooled before us like a broken cassette player farting out its tape, or like Paul McCartney unfurling his lizard tongue. It gave me plenty of time to listen to music, which is why this year's countdown will expand to a top 25.As in previous years, I'll write summaries of the many albums that didn't make my final list. I've called them \"also-rans\" in previous years, but this year I shall be nicer and call them \"special mentions\". Like that time I failed my cycling proficiency test, but got a \"special mention\" for not breaking any gnomes as I did the wheelie into the pond.Here's my usual disclaimer. Read this with a pinch of salt. The order of my top 25 would be different if I was blogging this a week earlier or a week later. I have written about my favourite album of the year for another website, but already that album has moved down the order. I am fickle, and by \"fickle\" I mean \"unreliable\" and by \"unreliable\" I mean \"not worth reading, I'm off to browse Pitchfork instead\".Despite my disclaimer, you should take the special mentions seriously. I will only include an album if it has properly interested me in 2020. It's not like a parent introducing all of their children with a forced grin when they'd rather hide their youngest in a scullery until the lesions have healed. No. Respect the albums. They have earned their place in this blogging series, and the gap from number one to the briefest of special mentions is smaller than you think.That's it. What else can I tell you? This end-of-year blog series is not available in Welsh. I haven't written a single word yet, so if I am kidnapped by pirates then the blog series will be replaced by repeats of Will & Grace. Never poop on a hedgehog because they are unhygienic as it is. It is possible for Jesus to love you but also to think you are a bit of a dick. That British plane couldn't have exploded in Die Hard 2 because it barely had any fuel onboard.Right. Off you pop. You've still got some turkey left. Go and make some sandwiches while I get on with writing. The blog posts will run hourly from noon until evening, starting either tomorrow or the day after, depending on how much writing time I get. I'll aim to announce the Album of the Year on the afternoon of the 31st, before you're too deep into your novelty absinth.Edit: the blog series has launched.

{"title": "Christmas: it's the most Fat Rolandable time of the year", "date": "Dec 24, 2020", "text": "\"It's swan juice,\" said a maid-a-milking. \"He's liquidised the swans.\"Since Fat Roland took over Christmas, things weren't quite the same.You all remember the Christmases from your childhood. Logs on the fire, Cliff Richard on the tree, soot-dusted orphan children begging for more as grandma threw Quality Street sweets at them. The green ones hit best. Sharp edges.It was all going so well. How you trilled with joy when X Factor scored Christmas number one year after year after year. Zuckerberg bringing in the death penalty for anti-Xmas Facebook groups was a genius move. The government declared Christmas \"strong and stable in a manger\" which everyone thought was very clever.But since the US Defence Department declared lapland as an axis of evil, the joyful festivities faced an uncertain future. How could you forget the announcement on the news: Huw Edwards, still heavily caked in make-up from his Geisha phase, announcing Fat Roland was going to Santa's workshop to negotiate.Obviously, the negotiations went awry and the rest is firmly written into the history books. Santa stockpiling nuclear materials. The army of sleighs. The robotic hummingbirds, which came as a bit of a surprise. The workshop explosions. The reindeer uprising. A triumphant Fat Roland piercing a flag into a stricken elf and declaring \"Christmas is mine, finally mine.\"And here you are. It's 2020. Fat Roland's version of Christmas. Carols are banned, replaced with filler tracks from mid-1990s IDM compilations. Midnight mass usurped by illegal raves in desolate forests. No-one's seen a turkey for weeks, and someone seems to have accidentally un-invented nut roast. Pringles for Christmas dinner again.In Fat Roland's defence, no-one liked eggnog. And who knew a blended swan would come out white, just like milk? Starbucks made a killing.Still... The dancing ladies have clocked off for the year. All six geese have a serious case of constipation, and half the leaping lords have done their back in. The twelve days of Christmas has been reduced to a half-hour special on 4Music. Things are not what they used to be.2020 seems like a blighted Christmas, loyal reader, with many of your traditions locked away until a future year. A few people are blaming some kind of virus for the seasonal disruption, but you all know what went down. It's Fat Roland's fault. Look at Huw Edwards' immaculately mascaraed eyes. How could he be lying?In the words of old crooner Andy Williams:It's the most wonderful time of the yearWith the kids exacting revenge for that time you threw chocolates at themAnd everyone telling you be of good cheerIt's the most wonderful time of the yearIt's not perfect. But it's still your Christmas. Make something good out of it. Many festive felicitations from Electronic Music Stuff with Fat Roland.Oh, and if anyone has seen Fat Roland, please contact your local police.

{"title": "14 'til I die: remembering the teenage me's music habits", "date": "Dec 21, 2020", "text": "As we approach the end of 2020, the UK is a virus-ridden pariah country, its coastlines rammed with stranded lorries, its inhabitants throwing ungifted Christmas presents into shopping trolley-infested canals.No wonder we prefer to look to the past instead, when everything was sunshine and happiness and ice cream. Take the current meme in which you post albums from when you were 14. That's nice, isn't it: thinking of the music at a formative moment of your life rather than the current apocalypse.For the teenage-era albums, I chose Pet Shop Boys' Actually, the Mel & Kim album, a Richard Clayderman collection and Introduce Yourself by Faith No More. Richard who? Ask your great, great grandparents. I was very into piano when I was a kid.The truth is I can't remember what I listened to when I was 14. Those albums sound about right, but remembering that far ago is like looking through frosted glass that's been encased in bubble wrap then wedged between two slabs of lead.I do know that the 14-year-old me listened to classical music, enjoyed drawing and photocopying comics, was very involved with the local church, and was thoroughly addicted to the daytime soap Neighbours. I definitely had a musical ear to the ground: I remember T'Pau and La Bamba and George Harrison and Starship (overwrought emotions pictured above).But despite my ongoing obsession with A-Ha's Hunting High And Low, I was a bit too young for albums. I was more likely to make my own albums by taping the charts, then editing those tapes using my dad's tape-to-tape recorder. I have an entire crate of these cassettes somewhere. Or if I did buy an album, it would be a greatest hits, like the scene in which Alan Partridge reveals his favourite Beatles album.I slowly learned that albums could be a complete expression: a journey from A to B – literally, considering the formats of the time. By the time I was 18, I was an album aficionado: I even wrote a music column for a local paper. And by \"aficionado\", of course, I mean \"naïve and egotistical mess\" because that's what a lot of 18-year-olds tend to be.In fact, it's horrible looking back. Being a teenager then wasn't good. When I was 14, in the year 1987, the world was only just starting to tackle the HIV / AIDS pandemic, while political superpowers were still brandishing nuclear warheads at each other. I've just looked up 1987 on the internet, and there were plane crashes and a tsunami and political kidnappings and the birth of Marcus from Mumford And Sons. 1987 sounds terrible.As for me? I was horrible too. I was a disease-ridden social pariah, my messy bedroom rammed to the rafters with tatty comics: I produced so many teenage juices – mainly pimple goo – that I might as well have been sleeping in a shopping trolley-infested canal.As we approach the end of 2020, I'm looking to the future. There's not much sunshine and happiness and ice cream right now, but it'll come. I'll also be writing up my annual Best Albums list because I'm dead good at albums, me.Further Fats: The Stone Roses and the seriously stained alley of nostalgia (2011)Further Fats: Cassette tapes are back, which is why I've got my sausage out (2020)"},

There's bleepy pioneer Daphne Oram on the cover, as aqua blue as a posh swimming pool, and inside you'll find loads about the Oram Awards. which celebrates inspirational female and gender minority audio innovators. Proper treat.My column this month arose from the drum machine I bought from a lovely chap called Martin who runs the Electronic Music Open Mic Night, which incidentally happens to be the only music gig I've been to throughout the coronavirus crisis. As usual, though, I got sidetracked so, er, this happened:And yes, I just alt-texted that cartoon \"Yello and a big sprout\". You'll have to read the column to get the illustration's context, although in the words of my editors in the blurb for this month's column, \"When Band Aid sang 'It's Christmas time, there's no need to be afraid', they clearly hadn't reckoned on this.\"Every month, Electronic Sound runs a Time Machine piece which brings to life particular moments in the history of electronic music. I thought I'd have a go this month, so on pages 18 and 19 of this new edition I recall the time Cher became president of the USA and Timmy Mallett destroyed all known society.I've also got a couple of album reviews in there too, which contain words like \"fossilised\", \"mushroomy\" and \"beanbag\".I must say a massive thanks to Electronic Sound for allowing me, for another year, to wheelbarrow all my nonsense words into your finely-pruned magazine garden, raking my bad compost all over your journalistic begonias.

{"title": "Dance music fans, I have bad news about Christmas", "date": "Dec 9, 2020", "text": "Every now and then, mega cool dance music dominates the charts.Yeah, I said \"mega cool\". Deal with it, kids.Like the time the Chemical Brothers' Setting Sun topped the charts in 1996, the same year the Prodigy took the top spot twice. Or the moment Kraftwerk knocked Shakin' Stevens off number one. Or 21st century bangers breaking past a mush of identikit dance records such as Mint Royale's Singin' In The Rain or Kiesza's Hideaway.The bad news is that Santa is having none of this. He hates dance music. He's your crusty old grandpa banging on the ceiling with a walking stick, or in his case, an elf. There has never been a mega cool dance hit as Christmas number one.There must be some Christmas chart toppers with dance elements, right? A pearl among the oysters, a bit of gristle amid the constant stream of watery gravy, something credible besides Jimmy Osmond, Cliff Richard, all the Band Aids and Shayne flipping Ward.Wait. Yazoo's Only You was Christmas number one in 1983. Vince Clarke! Alison Moyet! Synths! Except this was the a cappella version by The Flying Pickets: not dancey at all. Dammit.What else? Not much. Mr Blobby's self-titled 1993 Chrimbo chart-topper was a dance music track, with its horrendously outdated Stock Aitken Waterman rhythms. But it can't count: it was a children's singalong with a bunch of kids who deserved to be sent up t'chimneys.Apart from one track I'm yet to mention, that's it. Everything else is ballads, charity singles or people singing about sausage rolls. If Christmas was a nightclub, it would have been long bulldozed to make way for an Asda. I believe in the power of redemption, such as celebrity chefs doing interesting things with the long maligned sprout, but there is no hope here: the Christmas chart topper will never be a mega cool dance hit.Except...There is a pure, club-thumping dance track that made it to number one. It had samples, a roof-raising build-up and key change, and a pretty nifty breakbeat. That's right. Bob the Builder's Can We Fix It? is the most danceable festive number one in history.Has Bob fixed it? Yes, he has. Have a listen: that's a proper skippy breakbeat right there. Even better, he knocked Westlife off the top of the charts when he became the Christmas chart-topper in 2000. Santa Claus is squeezing down your chimney, and he's armed with a cartoon wrench and Neil Morrissey dressed a reindeer.Thank you, Bob. Or should I call you Robert?

Some anonymous account with a manga avatar is obsessed with Bullet for My Valentine.I won't share mine because I feel guilty about Spotify. I use it all the time, and I have a recommendation series on Twitter that's almost two years old. But the lack of money flowing to artists really bothers me. Apparently every time you stream a song, the songwriter receives a poo in a box with a label attached saying \"soz no money 4 u\". It's not right.Hype Machine has done a clever thing called Merch Table in which you can input a Spotify playlist and it'll point you towards Bandcamp pages. You can then fork out your well-earned krona and place money straight into the pockets of the musicians. Obviously, you can also do that as you pass them in the street, but doing it on Bandcamp is less alarming for them.Incidentally, in my latest column for Electronic Sound magazine I turn my wonky spotlight on Bandcamp Friday. This is the monthly fee-waiver designed to help struggling artists in a difficult 2020. Or, as I write in my column:\"If you purchase tunes on that day, the act is charged nothing instead of the usual levy of 15% cash, a stash of stolen diamonds and a child sacrifice to the seventeen-nippled god Bandus Campos.\"I had fun illustrating Bandus Campos alongside my column (snippet above). I suppose if Spotify had a god, it would be a vengeful Old Testament one, or maybe an absent one leaving its directionless subjects having their sackcloth and ashes eaten by goats. Or something. It's a long time since I read the bible.So yes, no cheeky tweet from me advertising Spotify Wrapped. Just all these words on a blog. And all those recommendation tweets.The gods are frowning on me.Further Fats: Do you pay for your record collection? (2009)Further Fats: Spotify's mystical rivers of bad recommendations (2020)"},

He'd previously played an E-flat for 45 minutes and 47 seconds, which is a lot of E-flat. Although his record was since broken, there's no evidence of Mr G succeeding in his in-flight blow job, and apparently Guinness World Records aren't bothered about it anymore.11th September 2018Failed reality TV singer Steve Brookstein appears to have deleted his Twitter account. THIS is the day that music died.— Fat Roland (@FatRoland) September 11, 2018 The day that the terrible Steve Brookstein deleted his terrible Twitter feed. I think his account was restored: I don't know and I can't be bothered to check. A jazz Twitter account took my tweet at face value and invited me to a Brookstein gig in Cobham. I didn't go.28th September 2018Ah hold on, THIS is the day that music died. pic.twitter.com/EYfD0tBVtg— Fat Roland (@FatRoland) September 28, 2018 The day that a Bargain Hunt auction was artificially inflated by Bez's girlfriend sneaking in bids as a ringer. \"“My girlfriend thought she was helping out,\" said Bez, whose plan forced the programme to be reshot.

At the time of writing, its vote share has doubled, but it doesn't look hopeful. This is despite me praising its \"rhythms rising from the foundations of the clubs we no longer go to\" (read my article here). I think we can all agree that me not doing well in a competition is definitely the day that music died, making it comparable to the loss of legendary musicians in a devastating plane crash. Jeez. That's the worst thing I've written since Savile.And finally... Never?D'you know, I'm beginning to think that music's still alive. Check its pulse.

{"title": "Revealed! This year's total hottest contenders for the Christmas Number one", "date": "Nov 29, 2020", "text": "The battle for the 2020 Christmas number one single is hotting up.For the last 52 years, the festive chart-topper has been a charity single about cheese and onion pasties, apart from that one time a Facebook campaign put a gif of Eddie Murphy tapping his head at number one. What about this year? Right here, on this page, I can exclusively reveal the eight singles that are vying for this year's ultimate festive first place.Jess Glynne: Lonely This ChristmasThe all-conquering Clean Bandit collaborator hopes to tune into the melancholic side of Christmas with this Elvis Presley classic. The song will be played at half-speed with a gentle folk backing, while Glynne will be laying down her vocals in the chinos department of a burned-down BHS. The cover design will be a sad-face emoji with just a hint of a wink.Liam Gallagher's Low Slung Birds: Standing On The Shoulders Of SantaThis interminable dirge will feel very much like the non-week between Christmas and New Year, with the over-produced guitars engendering a sense of pointlessness in all who listen. The video will feature Michael Smiley from Spaced being a cheeky chappy before falling into a Victorian sewer and being made to eat his bowler hat. Liam will pronounce \"Christmas\" as \"Chris-me-yaaaass\".Russ Abbott: A PotatoThis cheery comedy legend racked up millions of YouTube hits from an old quiz show clip of him singing a silly song about a raw potato. To entertain families during lockdown, he revived the song by video-duetting with many famous people such as Bella Emberg, Prince Andrew and Pol Pot. As a result, potatoes sold out on supermarket shelves across the UK and people had to use toilet roll instead.The Paul Brothers feat. EMF: Let's All Come Together, BitchesYouTube superstars Jake and Not-Jake Paul will spend the Christmas season spitting into people's faces, pulling down skirts and laughing at funerals. YouTube will validate their behaviour by not poking them in the eye with a stick. The Pauls will put no effort into their Christmas single, which will be written and recorded in its entirety by EMF. The Gloucestershire popsters didn't want to do it, but it's been a while since Unbelievable and they need the money.Cat Bin Lady: Drop It Like It's HotAlthough vilified first time round, Cat Bin Lady had an unlikely surge in popularity this year when video remixer Mini-Disc Man made a supercut of her binning a cat set to an old Snoop Dogg track. To offset this yuletide's many feline deaths from inevitable copycat pussycat trashcannings, all profits from this single will go to the Wheelie Bin Protection League.Robbie Williams: Hello?This comprises seven hours of Robbie Williams stuck inside a chimney going \"hello? hello? anyone?\" over and over again, before succumbing to a lack of oxygen and, one day, falling as bones into an open grate while an unsuspecting family celebrates Hanukkah. Not his greatest work, but a damn sight better than his video for Rock DJ.Various artists: Screams from the voidThis is not a song. It is the sound you have been hearing in your brain throughout 2020. You've been humming 'Jingle Bells' to yourself to drown out the noise. When Santa arrives he will devour the saucer of mince pies you left out for him with his seventeen tongues, and then his reindeers will start screeching, the terrible cacophony consuming all known energy and light. Also your fairy lights will stop working, revealing your Christmas tree to be little more than a purloined slab of forestry left to rot inside a house.Kirsty McColl: F*** You, You W****ing B***boy F**** Not one for kowtowing to woke culture, McColl's archive recording says what we've all been thinkin— (that's enough - ed)Further Fats: Live blog – Rage Against The Machine versus a small boy with white teeth (2009)Further Fats: Fat Roland's Christmas message – just like the Queen's but with more poopy baubles (2019)In 1991, Candi Staton's You Got The Love got to number four in the UK charts. You know the track because as soon as it opens with her \"sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in air\", everyone looks at everyone else and shouts \"tuuuune!\"I never realised at the time, but this was probably my first introduction to Frankie Knuckles, the 1991 hit being a bootleg of a Staton acapella set over Knuckles' track Your Love, itself a beefed up mix of the Jamie Principle original.That's not the reason why I'm writing this blog post. Fast forward to 1997, and a giddy remix of You Got The Love got to number 3 in the charts, surpassing the original. This Now Voyager version, all chunky breaks and happy piano, was a cracker. I was so excited about this new mix that I rushed into town to get a copy on vinyl.There's something you need to know about me. I am an idiot. I have a spectacular knack at fouling things up. That's not to say that my purchase of this thrilling new remix didn't mostly succeed: the bus into town did not fall off a cliff, the shop assistant in HMV was fully clothed, and the record didn't turn into a pumpkin before I got home.I turn on my record player. I take the record out of the sleeve. I fumble. The disc catches the corner of the record player. A side of the record shatters, a big triangular shard falling onto the floor. My purchase is ruined before I've played a note.In those days, of course, it's not as if I could jump onto Spotify or look up the track on YouTube. We didn't have home internet back then. We only had books and newspapers and gruel. We didn't even have Channel 5, if you can imagine such a state of affairs.I can still picture myself holding the record for a short while in disbelief at the stupid thing I had just done. It was barely a tap. Maybe it would still play? Can I go back into town and get another one? What do I do now? Is the next six minutes of silence somehow a judgement on my ability to mess things up?And so now, whenever those lyrics begin – \"sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air, I know I can count on you\" – I turn to people and say \"tune\" but I also think of that simple mistake. I also think of my ability not to take these small things too seriously: I'm at peace with my idiocy.As Candi herself says:Sometimes it seems that the going is just too roughAnd things go wrong no matter what I doNow and then something something something, the sound of a needle scrapingBut you've got the love I need to see me throughBuyer beware: this man's an idiot (2010)Further Fats: A creative meltdown means horrible bowls and don't you forget it (2012)"},

I gave up my telly to allow more time on this blog. Better writing, a more frequent posting schedule, a few design bells and whistles. Less than a year later, I won at the blog awards. The resulting networking, fizzed with euphoria, cemented a bunch of new friendships that led me into a life of writing and performance. The win was a big kick up my ego's bum.I won the category of Best Writing and then jointly-won the overall Best In Show prize (shout out to my co-winner Love Levenshulme). I was an extremely happy puppy. According to this account of my win ten years ago, in my acceptance speeches I apologised to James Blunt and namechecked Venetian Snares.On the back of that night, I ended up prancing around Manchester's spoken word open mic scene with increasingly ambitious and silly props. This led to three Edinburgh Fringe shows and a crazily fun theatre commission from the Lowry Theatre. I produced two collections of my own short stories, and co-edited a third with a bunch of writing friends. I ended up hosting a leading spoken word night and, ultimately, the wacky world of literature events became my main source of income.I'll forever be grateful for my blog awards win: I cannot overstate how much confidence it gave me, almost as if I needed that permission to take my creativity seriously. I'm also grateful to Caribou's Sun for being the anthem for my drunken celebrations that night. Listen to the radio edit of Sun below.Here I am a full ten years later, and life couldn't be more different in a Covid-curtailed 2020. I've spent seven months cancelling literature events and spending an awful amount of time not seeing those friends who'd made the last decade so amazing. No shows, no silliness, no props. Just me sitting in a dark room writing this, my 1,394th blog post, reminiscing about the good old days when men were men, sheep were sheep, and blogs had readers.I'm not sad, though. The elapsed time means nothing because the feelings are still so immediate in my mind: the announcement shocking me so much it felt like an arrow to the forehead, walking up to the stage in slow motion while trying not to fall over, the awkwardness of the unprepared speech, and that woozy drunken glow for a long time afterwards. And a whole decade of amazing collaborations and friendships.

{"title": "A Full On Guide to Full On: Megatonk's Belgium and Frendzy's Can't Stop (these are real tracks, honest)", "date": "Oct 19, 2020", "text": "I've been blogging my way through the 1990s house music compilation Full On: Edition One. But then I stopped for a bit. I had to take a break. I've been living a slightly isolated life during the whole coronavirus thing. No partner to say good morning to, no elderly relatives to mouth greetings at through a window, and no Fat Roland clones in my basement lab, not since they escaped. I can spend days locked in my own head.Which means my mental health ebbs and flows, like the tide of an ocean, only with less seaweed. Sometimes I need to step away from things to allow myself to be a bit mentally quieter. Hence not blogging for two weeks.Let's get back to the 1992 Deconstruction compilation, which most of you won't remember, but which all of you can look up on Discogs.Megatonk's Belgium is a perky house track with sampled diva vocals that were the staple of Moby tracks back in the 1990s. Have a listen here.Megatonk was one of the many aliases of Charles Webster, a remixer and label owner who once engineered for the likes of Juan Atkins and Kevin Saunderson. There's not a huge amount to say about Belgium. The track appeared in a mix by Sasha at the Universe club back in 1992, blended in with Lil Louis's Club Lonely. The two tracks work nicely one after the other. On an Azuli Classics compilation a number of years later, DJ John Digweed would mix into Belgium from an INXS track, which sounds terrible but I'm sure worked just fine. Probably.A more interesting track, in my humble opinion, is the next Full On tune: Frenzy's Don't Stop. I'm pretty sure that echoing saxophone sample is from a Grid track. Have an earful:The track's actually called Can't Stop and the act seems to be actually called Frendzy, but let's not let a wonky CD listing get in the way of a good tune. This track is deep and hypnotic and everything good about house music in the 1990s.I can find naff all information about Frendzy, a name which sounds like a failed social network. Production was by Hari, a long-time DJ fixture at Glasgow's Sub Club, and Shug Brankin, who has remixed Apache Indian and, if my googling is correct, once got a load of college kids to make balloon hats.What can we conclude from these two tracks? One reminds me of Moby and the other reminds me of The Grid. No bad thing.More Full On faffing to come.Read the Full On series in, er full.Read the Full On introduction explaining what the heck this is all about."},
{"title": "A Full On Guide to Full On: Eternal's Mind Odyssey and Felix's It Will Make Me Crazy", "date": "Oct 5, 2020", "text": "Next up on Full On: Edition One is Eternal's Mind Odyssey. Eternal was Melbourne club promoter Mark James, who set up the Eternal project with uber massive DJ legend and drag racer Carl Cox. Mind Odyssey came out on Warp Records in the UK, with a catalogue number WAP 27 which places it at around the same time as Polygon Window's Surfing On Sine Waves. This makes him proper techno royalty.Pop this in your ears:This Eternal is not to be confused with 1990s r'n'b popsters Eternal who wanted to \"be the only one, the only one\". Having said that, Mark has his pop side: he was in a band called Bass Culture with his then girlfriend Gina Gardiner, who later had a big Eurovision hit as Gina G with the appalling Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit. Gosh, is this what it's like to write a gossip column?Eternal would be the star of this blog post, but next up on the Full On track listing is Felix. The track is Felix's second biggest hit It Will Make Me Crazy, remixed by Rollo of Faithless fame. Listen here:If Mark James is techno royalty, in the world of Euro-flavoured progressive house Felix is even bigger: a huge pulsating techno God larger than the known universe.That's not to say Felix was more successful: James' career is huge. But the Felix sound summed up the Full On experience for me. Big cheesy chords, big housey vocals, super-sharp snare clicks, moody minor chords, simplicity throughout. It has to be said, this did sound a lot like his biggest hit Don't You Want Me, and the album was very samey. But if it was a formula, it was such a satisfying formula, and I got the impression that a lot of people were copying the Felix sound. Including me at the time on my little Korg keyboard.Stylistically, Felix's sound isn't a hundred miles away from 2 Unlimited, whose career was taking off at the time of Full On. 2 Unlimited were much bouncier and stoopider, and had far less credibility. The lyrics are hugely different for a start. Here's the words for It Will Make Me Crazy:It will make me crazy!It will make me crazy!It will make me crazy!It will make me crazy!And here are the lyrics to 2 Unlimited's Get Ready For This:Techno!Techno!Techno!Techno!See? Totally different. Incidentally, and sorry to keep bouncing between the two Felix singles, but Don't You Want Me hit the UK top ten twice, and then charted a third time when it was used in a Tango advert. Felix was born in Chelmsford in Essex, as was Squarepusher, Ceephax Acid Crew, Hazell Dean, Sarah from St Etienne, Grayson chuffing Perry, and, er, the drummer from McFly. There's something in the water in Chelmsford.What does this all say about Full On and its significance for 1990s dance music? I dunno: I stopped paying attention around about Gina G.Have an advert:Read the Full On series in, er full.Read the Full On introduction explaining what the heck this is all about."},
{"title": "A Full On Guide to Full On: Orson Karte's Tonight", "date": "Oct 2, 2020", "text": "My deconstruction of the Deconstruction album Full On: Edition One continues. I realise this is niche, but it was a great compilation that deserves more attention. See all my Full On posts here.The next track is Orson Karte's Tonight (Original Mix), a smooth-as-a-sausage progressive house track with sampled voices drifting loosely above warm ambient chords. It doesn't stay in the same place either, as it gets its head down for some skippy breakbeat action later in the track.Have an ear-check here:Let's have a bit of context. I'm about to throw a lot of information at you. If this following paragraph had a montage sequence, it would freeze at each person's face like a Guy Ritchie film to give you time to absorb all the names. Orson Karte was not a well-known act in itself, but its members Julian Dembinski and Lex Blackmore also recorded as Positive Science for Ascension Records, an offshoot of the legendary ambient label Rising High Records probably best known for releasing music by The Irresistible Force, A Homeboy, A Hippie & A Funki Dredd and Luke Vibert. In short: no-one's really heard of Orson Karte (terrible name) but they come with some considerable pedigree.More interestingly, Alexis Blackmore – Lex to his nearest and dearest – is responsible for one of the most memorable top ten hits of all time.\"Which memorable top ten hit?\" I hear you ask, as you gasp in awe at your computer screen. \"Is it Vienna by Ultravox? Blue Monday by New Order? Lovin' Is Easy by Hear'Say?\" If you can just shut up asking questions, I'll tell you.Lex ploughed a furrow on the dance music scene touring with The Shamen, apparently contributing to the rap on the Mysterons-sampling Make It Mine. Following the untimely death of The Shamen's Will Sin, he moved to Glasgow and became... drum roll... Blue Boy.\"Who?\" Who?! What do you MEAN \"who\"? You definitely know Blue Boy. They had one of the most memorable top ten hits of all time. Positively iconic. Here are the lyrics, which you definitely recognise:Remember me?I'm the one who had your babiesRemember me?I'm the one who had your babiesGing-giggaging giggigiggiging etc etc etcYeah, you know it. Incidentally, Remember Me sampled Marlena Shaw's 1973 live version of Woman Of The Ghetto, which is definitely worth a listen right here. The \"babies\" line later on in the song contains so much sorrow.So here we have another insight into Full On. A relatively anonymous act called Orson Karte can be tracked to, five years later, a big stonking top ten single which went some way to defining a '90s 'sound'.There is plenty more Full On analysis to come (see the track listing here), but it will all be a bit less interesting than this one.\"WHY won't it be interesting?

Is the emphasis on the Lion or on the Rock? Who knows.It's another early progressive house classic. Justin 'Lionrock' Robertson worked in Manchester's Eastern Bloc Records and built up a neat line in banging four-to-the-floor tunes. Get your ears around this: What's most interesting about Robertson is how his music went on to progress throughout the decade. 1993's Packet Of Peace was notable not only for its acidic lines, but for its conscious-style rap from MC Buzz B. (Not an actual bee.)By 1995, he was pumping out breakbeats in the form of Straight At Yer Head, and in 1996 he blessed us all with his brilliant Sherlock Holmes-themed big beat album An Instinct For Detection. Oh how this Mancunian trilled at the Manchester-themed track titles: Snapshot On Pollard Street; Wilmslow Road. If memory serves me correctly, he was living in Withington at the time.His inclusion on 1992's Full On album cements Manchester's reputation as a far-flung Balearic isle: shake those maracas, Bez.The next track on Full On keeps us in Northern England. Little Rascal's Movin' To The Beat is a lively piano house track with a dollop of Newcastle attitude. I'm pretty sure this would have stormed the Northern clubs back in the day. It's insanely happy:The Little Rascal himself is label owner Chris Scott, who has electronic music projects coming out of his ears. He's a member of Lexicon Avenue and Echomen, and scanning his list of remixing and production credits, you can spot names like Darren Emerson and John Digweed. This is a bloke hard-wired into club culture.I know very little about Newcastle. The only time I have been in the North East, at least as an adult, was a visit to a single pub in which a guitarist was playing Jimmy Nail's Crocodile Shoes.Do you know what I like about this album already? There's something gratifying about a club sound that can slip so easily from Northern Italy to North-East England. It's deliciously European and delightfully unifying.Speaking of careers progressing throughout the 1990s, the next progressive house track on Full On – Edition One features someone responsible for one of the most memorable top ten hits of the decade.

I can't find a stream of the particular remix, but here is a version.Slightly tribal progressive house, setting the tone for the Full On album. Shift was released on Limbo Records, a label that arose around Glasgow record shop 23rd Precinct, a place frequented by the legendary and uber-cool Slam DJs. You've heard of Slam: they're responsible for the Slam tent mentioned by Limmy here.Where's the Slam Tent? https://t.co/SZsA8nERVz— Limmy (@DaftLimmy) October 22, 2014 So yes, Glasgow is a very clubby city. I once hung around in Glasgow kebab shop after a club kicked out at 4am: these folks know how to party.Limbo Records once held an online poll between Shift and Havana's other big track Schtoom. The latter won with 69% of the vote. It's like Brexit all over again, although with totally different voting numbers and no direct comparison to be made so please ignore this paragraph.Let's move along. Havana, who sometimes spelled their name with a double N, was followed by Italian-Columbian house act Ramirez and a track called Hablando (it means 'talking' or thereabouts).Ramirez was a project of the DFC (Dance Floor Corporation), another pioneering underground label that was an advocate in Italy for house music before any Italians were bothered about house music. The imprint was the dance offshoot of Expanded Records, who'd struggled to sell new wave and punk records. They got into dance music in the late 1980s because their Bologna heritage. Label boss Giovanni Natale told Billboard in 1994:\"We got into the dance field, and it works because traditional Italian melody is ripe to be recycled into Euro-dance riffs.\"I wonder if this is what is going on with the accordion line in Hablando. Have a listen. Again, I don't think this the exact same version that's on the album: let's just assume a whole bunch of the Full On tracks aren't available online, and we'll have to settle with different mixes.We're three tracks in and we're already feeling the full Italian flavour of this Euro disco, via the underground Scottish club scene.

Let's start with the first track on the album: Usura's Open Your Mind.This was a pumping hippy house number that went top ten all over Europe. Have a listen.The lyrics are pretty easy to get to grips with:Open your mind (oh)Open your mind (oh)Open your mind (oh)Like a lot of dance tracks at the time, it was heavily based on samples, with the \"oh\" exclamation taken from the very beginning of Ashford & Simpson's 1984 single Solid. The \"open your mind\" hook is taken from the bit in Total Recall when Arnie meets a grotesque belly baby. No, really.The main chord sequence is such a heavy sample of Simple Minds' New Gold Dream, it's essentially a cover version. I didn't like Simple Minds when Open Your Mind came out, but I hadn't twigged the connection. They were secretly feeding me Jim Kerr's rock sludge, like sneaking vegetables into a child's dinner.The choice of Open Your Mind as the opening track on Full On – Edition One was an obvious choice. The bloke from Usura ran Time Records in Italy, a label that played an important part in pushing Italo disco and euro-house. I presume Decon had a deal to release Time tracks in the rest of Europe and beyond.I bought Usura's album, also called Open Your Mind. It contained their follow-up single Sweat which sounded so much like Open Your Mind, I felt pretty ripped off. You're not allowed to release soundalike tracks in an attempt to replicate past successes. Little did I know this was exactly how pop music worked.There you go. Track one on Full On – Edition One.

{"title": "A Full On Guide to Full On: introduction", "date": "Sep 27, 2020", "text": "When Kylie Minogue moved to Deconstruction Records to release Confide In Me, she gained an indie credibility entirely absent from her Stock Aitken and Waterman past.And yet, Deconstruction was no less pop. Co-founded by Mike Pickering of M People, they had the big piano anthems of Black Box, K-Klass and Bassheads and M People. Taking on Kylie seemed an entirely sensible choice.There was one compilation, however, which cemented Deconstruction's underground credentials. It was Full On: Edition One, subtitled \"a year in the life of house music\". This was Decon sticking a massive flag on the moon, and that moon was underground dance music. Not that moons can be made from abstract nouns, but you get the idea.The cover design wasn't great. Here is its Discogs image in all its low-resolution glory. It looks like the front page of a financial company's glossy annual report. \"Yah, Damien says the VAT changes have had a peripheral effect on out-sourcing but the bottom line remains pretty solid.\"I shouldn't knock the designers, Farrow Design. They have pretty solid credentials, helping define the look of post-Richie Manics, Orbital's 20th anniversary, and recent Pet Shop Boys.Anyway, I'm not here to talk about whether navy goes with burnt orange. I'm here to talk about the music.Full On came out in 1992, which made it pre-cool-Kylie but post-Italo-house. 2 Unlimited had taken the charts by storm with their lowest common denominator \"techno\" sound. Full On had a foot in similar bouncy Euro-house, but there was something so much more listenable about it.It had Felix and Usura banging out thumping anthems for blocky pre-Windows-95 visuals. It had an early appearance from Justin 'Lionrock' Robertson', laying an early warning shot for the rise of big beat. And it had a nascent appearance from someone who, five years later, would score one of the most memorable top ten singles of all time.So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to analyse one track a day and I'm going to call it a Full On Guide to Full On. I'll do two tracks a day if I don't have much to write about. Three if I'm really struggling. You can see the complete track listing on Discogs.Don't worry: if you never listened to this album, you should still enjoy this. I'm going to shine a light on 1990s dance music by, er, deconstructing this Deconstruction album.

But Ben is a clever bunny. He has been turning the spotlight of criticism onto his recommenders as well as the music they have been recommending.It's a cruel twist. That's like going to the opera, settling into your seat with your glossy programme and those little binoculars stolen off an Action Man, then the befrocked cast turning to the audience and gruffly demanding \"Entertain us, scum!\"It's exactly like that.The Best Music Recommender in the World is a competition in which Ben spends his weekends listening to music nominated by his readers, then ranks everyone's choices. There's a leaderboard and everything. He's been working through the alphabet and this coming weekend will be about acts beginning with Y.This is natural territory for me: I consider myself a pretty decent music recommender. It's why this blog exists. I write album reviews for Electronic Sound and have been guffing on about bands since my first ever job, music columnist for the South Manchester Reporter, in 1991.I have recommended to Ben the likes of µ-Ziq, EOD, Rival Consoles and, perhaps less successfully, Transglobal Underground. Overall, I was pretty confident I would win this thing.It all went wrong when I tried to game Ben's system, switching one of my recommendations on the basis of a Twitter conversation. I lost points for cheating. In fact, I was penalised a number of times. I was so desperate to win the affection of Ben's ears, I cut off my nose to spite my face. I became addicted to cheating. I became the Lance Armstrong of music recommending. My ego got the better of me, and it cost me bad. [Takes long drag on cigarette as camera pans in.] I suppose I flew too close to the sun, just like Icarus. Also I failed to covert Ben to the joys of Underworld, just like Icarus. I have no chance of winning the competition now. That said, I'm still in the top 20, and 261 points ahead of Rufus Hound (no, really). I'm going to keep recommending as we pass through the final letters of the alphabet.

We see you, Ringo, there's no use hiding.I rarely expect anyone mentioned on this blog to break through to the mainstream. In fact, it's hardly ever happened. There was Skream in 2010. And that same year, I mentioned Diplo \"breaking dubstep\" a year before he hit the charts with Tiësto, and five years before his all-conquering Jack Ü project. But other than that, I'm usually talking about acts long after they've hit the big time.Which is why this week's UK singles chart is a delight. Paul Woolford has notched up a top ten hit with a track called Looking For Me. An actual top ten hit! He's better known as Special Request, and has featured several times on this blog before now.I gave Special Request the accolade of second best album of 2013 (behind Jon Hopkins), which I described as \"a breaks album that is interesting, innovative and exciting\" while bigging up his farting basslines. I also mentioned his collection of \"dancefloor-mashing\" EPs in 2015, a 2017 album that was a \"Burial-inspired chill-out room\", and a 2017 EP that was \"beautiful, devastating, ear-bending and all kinds of wonderful\".Last year's Vortex was a \"speed-fuelled hymn to BPM\" and featured in my favourite albums of 2019. More recently I nominated Spectral Frequency as a highlight for Picky B*stards:\"Mr Request shoves you face-first into a raging waterfall of plunging junglist drums and low-flowing bass. It’s a heavy hit, and we spend the next five minutes concussed as the track becomes a flashback to every sweaty rave and every drug-soaked festival tent in history.\"\"Mr Request.\" Heh.And now he's a top ten superstar. This means he gets loads of limos and flowers and his very own private island, just like Elton John or Madonna or Jedward. People will be told not to make direct eye contact with him, and he is legally allowed to throw a hotel window through a television.Looking For Me is a big summery slab of 90s house music, and was produced by Woolford in collaboration with someone called Diplo (never heard of him).

{"title": "Flatulent balls: lockdown thoughts and a cartoon of a bull ", "date": "Sep 13, 2020", "text": "Issue 69 of Electronic Sound is out now. Alongside a smattering of finely honed reviews, you'll find my latest full-page column. This one is inspired by my lack of exercise throughout lockdown.I wanted this latest piece to feel quite physical, quite fleshy. So I start with a beautiful image of a cassette tape wedged into a roll of fat and take it from there. I also use the following words: balls, flatulent, gonads, groin, horns, nipples and orifices. Lovely.There's also my illustration, a section of which you can see in colour above. I've included a couple of first draft sketches which show I find it much easier to draw a big old bull than stupid annoying dumbbells.I don't mention the Covid crisis in my column, although that's where the writing process started. It's nearly six months since the UK tumbled into a viral dystopia. It's been heartbreaking for those who have lost loved ones or their income.Here are some personal thoughts about the whole coronavirus thing. I entered the pandemic as a (a) venue guy who did (b) journalism and (c) performing: the three e's of eventing, editing and egomania. Those elements of my work life have been affected in different ways.The venue bit of my life (running the gorgeous event space at Manchester's Burgess Foundation) has changed considerably, but I've been able to pivot my job into other things, namely coming up with clever online things that make people interested in Anthony Burgess. On this score, I am lucky to have a supportive employer, and I've found this work to be a boon amid the bedlam.The journalism bit of my life has remained unaffected. At the start of the year, I started illustrating my own monthly column for Electronic Sound, and if anything the lockdown bought me more time to work on the words and pictures. Long may it continue – you can subscribe here.The performing? Here's the interesting one. In fact, this is what I really want to talk about. Brace yourself.Over the past six months, the world of spoken word and comedy has moved to video. Twitch streams, Zoom gigs, Facebook premieres and the like. Rumour has it the internet is now made up of 692% TikToks.I did one video for The Old Courts, which was a huge amount of fun, but it made me realise that the whole point of my own performance is to react to the audience in the room. I need those surprise moments, those face twitches, that slow glorious 'failure' on stage. Online performing is kind of fine, but it doesn't thrill me. It doesn't scratch my egomaniacal itch. Thank goodness for that Garden Fringe real-life gig which still gives me a buzz every time I think about it. I have similar reservations as a consumer. I've enjoyed being part of the audience at the online XS Malarkey, chatting to techno heads in Orbital premieres, and a few fun things friends have done. However, the Burgess and journalism elements of my work life mean a lot of screen time: adding even more screen time into my day hasn't proved healthy. Added to that, sitting on my own in a distanced community just emphasises how far away my real actual friends are. There's a tinge of the blues to it all.All of which is to say: I have felt increasingly left behind by Covid-era entertainment. As audiences start to return to actual venues, comedy performers will start earning again, and an industry will slowly rise again. I hope that day comes soon. But this presents me with a dilemma.My own performing life, which was starting to move from spoken word into comedy, will be much slower to recover. Thing is, although I miss it, I don't *need* the money, and I'm not going to start hustling for paid gigs when a tonne of entertainers need to rebuild their income from scratch. I will gig again, of course, but my previous performance rate – a gig every couple of weeks and my 'residency' at a monthly spoken word night – is pretty much over.This all sounds depressing, doesn't it. However, I am an optimist: there is a silver trouser lining to this cloud of pants. I need to see this performing pickle as a challenge to up my game. Firstly, I need to become a facilitator (not that I wasn't already) by putting on alternative weirdo comedy gigs myself once audience distancing is less of a restriction. Create my own stuff, like that tall bloke out of Pointless. This will give me valuable stage time for my own material while giving a bit of cash to silly, funny performers. Secondly, I'm going to come up with an online series that leans heavily on my cartoons. I don't know what that is yet, but it needs to happen and no, it won't be a traditional performance for reasons I've waffled about already. I'm thinking possibly an animated guide to electronic music (caveat: not properly animated).All of these thought processes swirled around my head and ended up solidifying into a column about rolls of fat and groins and gonads. Funny how the mind works.I haven't mentioned blogging, by the way. I'm very sad to announce that this will continue unabated, and I will carry on pummelling your face with word-zingers for a long time to come.

You are presenting live streams with pop stars. Your career seems to be going very well, in your dreams.\" Thank you for pointing that out, reader.I would have preferred him to have sung his famous 1996 number one Return Of The Mack, but Mr Morrison insisted on going with his lesser known follow-up single Pump Up The World. Who wants him to perform that? That's like being rickrolled with Together Forever instead of Never Gonna Give You Up. Still, in my dream he seemed like a tough guy: I wasn't going to argue. When I woke up, I did some googling. His discography is full of awfully-named singles like Horny, Moan & Groan and MYLIFE 2.0, but the one he sang in my dream doesn't exist. Pump Up The World isn't a Mark Morrison single: there's no such song. Turns out the phrase is a lyric from the chorus of Return Of The Mack. \"Return of the Mack (once again) / Return of the Mack (pump up the world),\" says the song. My dream separated it out into a separate track. What's next, dream brain? One Cheeky Girl single? The J bit of Jedward going solo? I was devastated to find this falsehood. As he stood there on the steps of some bustling US public building (my dream didn't specify the city), the Mack sang some bogus, non-existent single. I remember enthusiastically announcing the song for the live stream, giving every bit of charisma for the camera. I did my part, but Morrison let me down with a egregious lapse of integrity. Dream Morrison is a liar and a charlatan and cannot be trusted.I know he's done some pretty violent stuff in his life, but if he turns up again in my brain, I'm kicking off. In my dreams, I'm well harder than him. I *am* going to argue. I'm gonna tweak his nose and give him an arm burn and do some v-signs at him. To misquote his own number one single, Mark Morrison lied to me. Yes, he tried, yes, he tried. He lied to me.I've posted about my dreams before on this blog, and I realise banging on about them may be a little tiring for my readers. But this really upset me.

My own contributions include an appraisal of the new album by Erasure (\"this neon flickers with regret\") alongside my takes on GLOK, Nicolas Bougaïeff and Ellen Fullman & Theresa Wong. M'colleagues have also written about new albums from International Teachers of Pop, Rival Consoles, Scanner and Daniel Avery. Well worth a read.Must stop writing: I'm about to miss the new episode of Eastenders / Only Fools And Horses / Birds Of A Feather / Brush Strokes / Howard's Way / the test card / Network 7 (delete as appropriate)."},
{"title": "The Battle of Britpop: the dullest beef in the history of beefs", "date": "Aug 15, 2020", "text": "This week, it's 25 years since the Blur / Oasis 'Battle of Britpop'. They went head to head in a battle for number one in what became a definitive moment for 1990s indie music. The battle lines were clearly drawn. You were either a chirpy Blur fan prancing around like a jolly Cock-er-nee chimney sweep, or you were a swaggering Oasis fan ready to have a scrap with \"our kid\".You had to choose one or the other, like the Mods or the Rockers, like the Beatles or the Stones, like Gordon the Gopher or Edd the Duck. And if you couldn't chose, you just feigned a Jarvis Cocker swoon and kept your nose out of it.Blur got the number one spot and Noel Gallagher tried to curse them with \"catching Aids\", but the victory meant nothing. This all-consuming pop war was hollow: a clanging bell full of sound, fury and cobwebs. Yes, there was the class war aspect: the Leadbetters against the Goods, upstairs versus downstairs. But my real issue is one of quality.It now seems criminal that two bands used their worst singles to create the dullest beef in the history of beefs, resulting in half a million record buyers being ripped off with sub-standard product.Roll With It is a leaden dirge that wasn't even worthy of a Slade b-side. Country House was Blur at their most annoying, so faux posh that you could imagine Jacob Rees-Mogg enjoying it. That's right: just imagine Rees-Mogg snuggling under the covers with his gramophone, flicking himself off to the line \"everything's going jackanory\".I wouldn't mind if this had been a couple of crap bands scrapping it out: if the Cheeky Girls wanted to have a fist fight with Las Ketchup, I'd have just left them to it. But these lads were at the top of their games – and they farted out such nonsense. I can only drool at some alternate universe in which The Masterplan went up against The Universal. Instead we got, in the parlance of South Park, a turd sandwich versus a giant douche bag.That was only the beginning. The massive media attention then morphed into 'Cool Britannia', the broadsheet-friendly Union Flag-waving version of Britpop that saw Ginger Spice become ruler of South Africa or something. Meanwhile, indie music never quite recovered: this fatal breach of quality opened up the beige hell-mouth that was the Stereophonics, Travis and Satan's favourite band Coldplay.I'm not necessarily saying that the Oasis versus Blur battle killed indie music forever: that's for you to decide. But what a con it was. Thank goodness for the Chemical Brothers and the Prodigy soldiering on during it all, cementing a glorious electronic future, otherwise there'd be no music left worth listening to apart from the ever-fading echo of disappointed sighs. As a great philosopher once wrote, \"I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside.\" You, me and the rest of us, Liam.Further Fats: Christmas chart battles and the chamber of echoes (2014)Further Fats: 1997: what the flip was going on?

{"title": "POP RATS ANAGARMS: the answers", "date": "Jul 31, 2020", "text": "As sure as the sun follows the rain, as sure as the buffalo follows the rabbit, it is now time to complete my pop music anagram series with... drum roll... the answers.If you've not been keeping up with my anagrams, then catch up on parts one, two, three and four. Go there now before you see the answers.Ready?Here we go. My two criteria for choosing the musicians I did were (1) they were well known and successful, and (2) I didn't like them. With each answer, I will justify point 2. Or at least, I'll try to.FLAKED MORNING ANUS (5,3,9) is Simon and Garfunkel:Their music seems weedy to me, as if it's not really trying. They need to back things up with a techno beat, or perhaps a spectacular pom-pom dance routine. Which one is Simon and which one is the other one? No-one really knows.I AM LUBE BELCH (7,5) is Michael Bublé:He's so middle of the road, it's like watching painted road lines dry. If he was a cat's eye, its eyelid would be half drooped with boredom. I realise things like Michael Bublé need to exist, like tables or shoe horns, but that's no reason to get excited about him.HAIRY CAMERA (6,5) is Mariah Carey:What's with the warbling? If someone did that to you on the street, you'd punch them on the nose. No-one needs to scale five octaves: just stick to the one octave. In fact, stick to the one note. There are too many notes.LIAR CHEAT USING AIR (9,8) is Christina Aguilera:It's so long since I've heard Christina Aguilera that I've forgotten what she sounds like. Was she the one in ABBA? Was she that X Factor winner who sang that song? Was she the baked potato one out of East 17? All I can remember is I didn't like her music.PERTURBING SCENES (5,11) is Bruce Springsteen:I know he's the boss and everything, but he's not the boss of me. I don't get the whole American blue jeans thing, or the whole stadium rock thing. Mainly the jeans. Why can't he wear a nice pair of cords? Or some orange slacks? Yes, orange slacks would be nice.BLAND BOY (3,5) is Bob Dylan:Hey, I get this guy's place in history, but I can't stand the voice. I think he's the reason I don't like folk music. I heckled Bob once, at Manchester's Free Trade Hall. I demanded he play some Judas Priest. I think people misheard me.TA, LEUKEMIA (5,5) is Katie Melua:Katie's music is warm and comforting, and I don't want warm and comforting. I want cold and uncomfortable: it's why I'm into techno. She should make some techno instead of counting all the bicycles in major Chinese cities.BYE, PISS RANTER (7,6) is Britney Spears:I didn't like the sexy schoolgirl thing: very worrying. I didn't like the whole Toxic bad behaviour thing: it was a bit meh. And as for her dubstep moment? For the love of Springsteen, poke out my ears with a Garfunkle.There you go.

{"title": "Blimmin' eck! Fat Roland's guide to the 2020 Mercury Prize", "date": "Jul 24, 2020", "text": "The Mercury Prize has announced its shortlist, and what a list. Who is who, why oh why, and what do they look like when you listen to them? I'm here to answer all of your nominee quandaries. Here is my album-by-album guide to the 2020 Mercury Prize.Anna Meredith – FIBSAnna is a proper classical music person who chucked all of her violas and trumpets into the sea and waited until a synthesiser washed up to shore. Somewhere there's a fisherman with a barnacle-clad flute wondering if he's found a new species of fish. Meredith's got a proper MBE, which stands for \"Music Brilliant Excellent\" or \"Mercury? Blimmin' Eck!\" The album sounds like she's pressed a single loop for ages on a Juno keyboard, but in a good way. It sounds like post rock for people made of cotton wool. Again, in a good way.Charli XCX – how i’m feeling nowFact I: Charli XCX is a Roman person called Charlie who lived in the year XCX. Fact II: She recorded this album under lockdown, which means she played the keyboards one-handed while waving goodbye in a Zoom meeting. Fact IIII: The album is full of r'n'b bangers that sound downloaded through an early-2000s modem. Fact IIIIIII (I've lost count): Charli says she sees music in colours, which is a shame because they didn't have colours in Roman times.Dua Lipa – Future NostalgiaDua Lipa is the queen of pop. Is she a benevolent queen, or a despotic one? That depends on how many people she's beheaded. Future Nostalgia is packed to the rafters with roof-raising pop bangers: she reminds me of Sophie Ellis Bexter but without a Blue Peter mum. I like that bit in the Dua Lipa single that goes \"pa da da daa pa de dah, oh!\" although I don't think that's on this album. Swing that axe, Dua! Oh hold on, the phone's ringing. Hello? I'm being sued for what? No, I don't remember telling my readers that the pop star Dua Lipa led a series of public executions in her bid to become the ultimate pop queen. Sorry, you must have the wrong number. Okay, bye.Georgia – Seeking ThrillsThis is not the eccentric electronic duo Georgia from the oddball Edinburgh imprint Firecracker Recordings. Which is a shame, because I liked what I heard. Instead, this is much more straightforward: summery dancefloor tunes perfectly designed for all the festivals that aren't happening right now. Georgia's dad was in some obscure act called Leftfield. The other Georgia, the one I remember, deconstructed music into a thousand Nintento shards: this Georgia rebuilds it.Kano – Hoodies All SummerGrime grandmaster Kano (pictured) has tonnes of award nominations: Mobos, Brits, Mercury Prizes, cycling proficiency certificates. They're literally pouring out of his every orifice. His track Trouble is already a modern classic, with the help of a 92-year-long video in which he shows off his spittin' skills. I'd advise against wearing a hoodie all summer, unless of course you've got stuff falling out of your orifices, in which case I'd recommend a number of hoodies placed at strategic points on your body to avoid the very real possibility of something shooting out of your bum and ruining the job interview and/or funeral you're attending. This is great advice: I hope someone's reading this.Lanterns on the Lake – Spook the HerdYou can't spook a herd of cows by putting lanterns on a lake: let's get that clear from the outset. You could set fire to a sheep, perhaps. Anyway, this Newcastle outfit's blend of folksy indie music provid– no, wait, I can't let this rest. Maybe make the shape of a cow ghost using the lanterns: the lake's ripples would make it move eerily. Or just throw the cows into the lake and chuck a lantern at them. Yeah, do that.Laura Marling – Song for Our DaughterMarling, who is not a fish, is one of the most nominated artists in Mercury prize history. She's been referred to as \"nu-folk\" which is like nu metal with fewer wallet chains. Marling, who is definitely still not a fish, wrote this album for a non-existent daughter. What is also non-existent is my interest in folk music. She'll probably win the Mercury, because a fish hasn't won the prize since James Hake in 2013. Wait. Was she a fish or wasn't she? Am I thinking of marlin? The Mercury needs to choose less confusing musicians.Michael Kiwanuka – KIWANUKAIf in doubt, just put your name in big letters. This is why I scribble FAT ROLAND on passing schoolchildren and Deliveroo riders. Kylie's first album was called Kylie, so I assume that's the sort of vibe the excellent Mr Kiwanuka was going for. He's got a labrador called Whisky, which is nice, although I doubt Whisky has ever written \"Whisky\" on anything, on account of not having opposable thumbs. Madonna's first album was called Madonna. This is Michael's third album: he's doing it all wrong.Moses Boyd – Dark MatterWhen I reviewed this album for Electronic Sound, I said Moses Boyd pinballed around his drum kit \"like an oiled whippet\". This was not meant to be a suggestion. I would sincerely like to apologise to any dog owners who have lost their pets due to unexpected slippage, but you shouldn't have been near the cement mixer in the first place. Where was I? Oh yes. Moses. Boyd. Jazz. Funk. Drums. More drums.Porridge Radio – Every BadLawks, it's an indie guitar album. I've not heard one of those since 2003. If you're not sure what a guitar is, it's like a synthesiser but shaped like an 8 and made of string. Weetabix Wireless, sorry, I mean, Porridge Radio are from Brighton. The beach in Brighton is most famous as a filming location for the Paul Bettany film Wimbledon. If a guitar album wins the Mercury, albeit one as good as this, all electronic music is dead. Fact.Sports Team – Deep Down HappySports Team are wacky, like a clown on a sausage, or a barbershop quartet up the nose of a walrus. Their critics say they are posh Cambridge lads who read too much John Betjeman. Why are they even in this list of best albums? I don't even like sports. Or teams. Or being happy deep down. Uh-oh! Coco's fallen off the bratwurst! So wacky! Like a goose in a top hat, or a buffalo in a fez, or morris dancers with googly eyes on their knees, or an office tie covered in cartoons of Stewie from Family Guy, or an inflatable penis dressed up to look like Prince Phillip, or saying the word \"Uranus\" the rude way, or a piece of poo on a stick, or a stick embedded in a massive poo, or stabbing yourself to death with a poopy stick, stab stab stab until the horror of this album is forgotten forever. Ahem. I think I need to lie down for a bit.Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadNever heard of him, sorry. Only joking! I am being very hilarious today, I hope someone's reading. Stormzy does actually have a very heavy head and has to carry it around in a wheelbarrow. Sometimes he wears bullet-proof vests just to support his torso, what with the weight of his colossal bonce. Stormzy once did a single about how his head was too big to fit in his boots, which to be honest we could have guessed without learning it in the song. If the actual Mercury prize is a medal worn around the neck, Stormzy is truly stuffed. Further Fats: \"Darius Versus The Venga Boys\": Fat Roland's guide to the 2011 Mercury Music Prize nominations (2011)Further Fats: A complete guide to the 2012 Mercury music prize nominations (2012)"},

Much better than the Wrought Iron Prize, the Tin Prize and the Ytterbium Prize. Yes, I just looked that up.In advance of the Mercury shortlist being announced later this week, my friends at Picky Bastards have cobbled together a pretty impressive alternative list of Mercury Prize nominationsFKA Twigs is hailed as a genius, there's praise for the warm analogue tones of Michael Kiwanuka, and Ghostpoet offers a \"masterclass in restraint\". One album is called an \"uncompromising, apocalyptic triumph\" but you'll have to read the article to find out which album it is.I've also made a suggestion: 808 State's Transmission Suite. \"808 State’s first album for 17 years wasn’t just a triumph in techno,\" I write. \"It was a brilliantly realised celebration of old electronics.\" Have a read of all of our alternative Mercury albums here.While you read that, I'm going to learn about ytterbium. It's named after Ytterby in Sweden, which is a bunch of houses built on a haunted mine. Apparently Ytterbium has a \"molar heat capacity\" , which I can only assume is to do with setting your teeth on fire. You shouldn't put ytterbium in your eyes, which, to be fair, you can say about most things.Have you finished reading that Mercury piece? Good. I can stop reading about ytterbium now: it's really dull.While I'm lazily researching things, here's something else. Wikipedia tells me the Mercury Prize is named after their original telecommunications company sponsor Mercury Communications. When Technics took over as sponsor in 1998, they kept the Mercury name, even though the Technics Prize would have loads more cred because of the whole turntable thing. Maybe the Technics Prize can be a dance music version of the Mercury, which would make me very happy. Someone set that up, please, thank you."},
{"title": "Fat Roland at the Garden Fringe — at a distance", "date": "Jul 20, 2020", "text": "On Saturday, I took some crack. Some sweet, sweet crack. At least, that's what it felt like. I performed 20 minutes of comedy at the first Garden Fringe event. It's a new post-lockdown project where people put on shows in socially-distanced back gardens.We were in a suburban garden (location only known to ticket-holders). There was a garden bar and shed toilets and it was all kinds of fun. I was on a bill with comedians Danny Sutcliffe, Allyson June Smith, who I thought included the overlooking neighbours brilliantly, and compere Dave Williams. My last performance had been at Leeds Lit Fest for Tales of Whatever in March, which seems like forever ago. I'd forgotten how much I need to perform. Big emphasis on the word NEED: there was a wild look in my eyes as I typed that. Although my knowledge of crack is limited to its usage by characters in 1990s postmodern fiction and the television comedy Peep Show, I'd image this is what crack addiction feels like. It's very \"moreish,\" as that bloke in Peep Show said.And the gig was a sell-out too! Admittedly, the limited capacity helped to achieve that, as we all still had leave enough space for the virus not to attack us. But it quickly became clear that, with a lack of shows around at the moment, audiences are really keen for local, safe entertainment. I suspect there will be many more shows like this.As a matter of record, here's some notes for my set, which is all a bit coded, and it's really for me to look back on this first post-corona gig at some point in the future.My set: Eel-vis Presley, socially-distanced pop stars, put on the hat, gay nose, record shop prices, pop star envelopes, more nose, pop music maths, knight meets dragon, puppy competition, even more nose, book of friendship, eggs, last bit of nose. (Gig also contained a dig at Daft Punk about which I am thoroughly ashamed.)Loads of people have got in touch with the Garden Fringe already, and you should too if you have I have a suitable show, a suitable garden, or would like to attend events.

{"title": "\"Is it okay to hate music?\" Fat Roland asks calmly", "date": "Jul 14, 2020", "text": "Is it okay to hate music?I've always been an snob when it comes to music. If a vocal or a rhythm track wasn't exactly \"right\", it would ruin the whole song for me: I'm a musical Goldilocks who can never settle on the best tempo of porridge.I've picked easy targets in the past for my most hated music. On this blog I have railed against, specifically, James Blunt, Ocean Colour Scene and Celine Dion. I forget their crimes now: their apparent transgressions have faded over time. I still hold a seething hatred of the following:\"Dad music\", usually comprising ageing rockers. Country and western, which is just folk music with horses. Opera, obviously. And anything popular. That's right: if the masses are into something, I have to be contrary and pretend I'm some kind of proto-John Peel into something obscure and difficult.Hmmm. Actually, I don't seethe. I never seethe. So much of my hate is simply comical ire because it makes for funny writing.I have never been an angry person. I remember a lot of shouty fighting in my family when I was a kid: my oldest brother storming out after a blazing row. I remember the tension, and spending some of my (mostly very happy) childhood being afraid. Combined with relentless bullying in school, it shook the rage out of me: made me see it as a futile emotion.So I've always been quite chilled. Very level-headed in a crisis. I'm also 16 years older than when I first started this blog, so I'm even more mellow than I was. Added to my natural inner calm is the gradual slowing of age, the creaking mantra of my ageing bones. I'm also getting fatter as I get calmer. I think I am possibly becoming Buddha.Don't get me wrong. Opera really sucks. And I can't stand Free's All Right Now and any version of American Pie: both songs have all the dynamic energy of a dead person's heart monitor, flat-lining from start to finish. Also if I hear Imagine one more time, I'm attacking John Lennon's piano with a hammer. And what about Nickelback and Billy Joel? Absolutely awful: I want to boil them in oil then boil that oil in oil. And if one more person comes up to me and says \"techno techno techno techno\", I'm going to get the twelve-inch of 2 Unlimited's No Limits and shove it right up their—No. Stop. Deep breaths. Find your happy place, Fats. Like I said, I'm a really calm, chilled guy. Ulp. Is it okay to hate music? Well, James Blunt, Ocean Colour Scene and Celine Dion are not really music, are they. It's just noise: an awful pop cacophony with as much musicality as a hundred walruses being fired out of a cannon. See? It's easy when you know how to write it.Further Fats: Who do I hate more?

Why not recreate the above sounds using cardboard tubes, a staple gun and some glitter?Despite all that noise nonsense, there is one sound that topped them all. There is one sound that was undoubtedly the best thing I heard in June...In fact, a whole bunch of us picked our favourite music of the month on the Picky Bastards website. One writer picked the new Phoebe Bridgers (pictured) album that everyone's banging on about. Someone else picked Lady Gaga's Chromatica. My pick? I chose Special Request's lightning-sharp Spectral Frequency, a track released a short while ago but rereleased this month on vinyl. It put a rocket up June's bum like nothing else.Read all about the track's resonating drums and sweaty rave flashbacks on the PBs website (my choice is at the end because I always submit last).

It left me feeling like a cartoon character that's just been exploded by TNT, leaving only a pair of smoking boots.The other day in Manchester, my home city, it was 900 degrees. Or something like that: I was too cooked to focus on the numbers. I went for a walk and the sun was so unbearable, I had to dive into the shade. Everyone looks suspicious diving suddenly behind a hedge. I got looks.It was hotter than a quartermaster's whelk. It was hotter than a jelly salesman's foghorn. It was hotter than a rampant barrister's whittling knife. It was hotter than a dog-whisperer's door handle cabinet. It was hotter than a confectioner's wardrobe on a Hungarian spaceship. It was hotter than a cheese bridge for dogs over a trench full of grandfather clocks. It was hotter than the year 1437 mauled in a bear trap by Robot Phillip Schofield.Those hotter-than comparisons were swiped from my previous tweets, by the way. I'd like to thank past-tweeting me for being an imaginative and nonsensical idiot.I think the sun is great, and even though horoscopes are hogwash, I do feel a connection with my star sign Leo. It's a fire sign that's ruled by the sun, which sounds really summery even though I have no idea what that means.I'm also quite fond of sun songs. For example, Orbital's The Girl With The Sun In Her Head, Caribou's Sun or The Beloved's The Sun Rising. They're so much better than, say, Engelbert Humperdinck's Winter World Of Love, the Glee Cast's version of Ice Ice Baby, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Snow (Hey Oh). Is that last one real? Yeesh.The problem is that I'm not very good with heat. I'd like all the benefits of summer weather but without the high temperatures. It would be nice if the sun was cold and fire felt like ice pops. All the colour and brightness without the sweat. That's not too much to ask, is it?I'm grateful rave culture based itself around Ibiza and not Nunavut, but there's a balance to be struck. Next time we have a heatwave, please let's have a cold one. Thanks."},

Ed Sheeran is the most played music artist of 2019.He beat Calvin Harris to top PPL's Most Played Artist Chart for the fourth time in five years. Coldplay broke that run as 2016's most-heard, although everyone now agrees we were all having a bad day and we listened to them by mistake.Sheeran scored three UK number one singles last year, respectively with Justin Bieber, Khalid and Stormzy. The most-played tracks of the year are full of collaborations too: Calvin Harris with Rag ‘n’ Bone Man; Mark Ronson with Miley Cyrus; Sam Smith with Normani. It's like no-one can do anything on their own anymore. They're all trying to emulate successful double acts like Ant & Dec and those two girls out of The Shining.It's interesting to see who Sheeran beat in the Most Played Artist Chart. In third place is Sam Smith playing the spoons while tightrope walking over a crocodile pit. In seventh palace is the sound of Rita Ora having a benny and throwing a television through a hotel window. And in tenth place is the whole of Maroon 5 screaming into a funnel.I once claimed that Ed Sheeran was here to destroy us all, that every song had become Ed Sheeran. In my defence, it was the week he broke the charts by scoring 16 top 20 hits at once. But even a stopped idiot tells the right time twice a day. Maybe I was pointing towards a future so Sheeraned, we forget how to listen to anything else. We are living in that future.Extensive surveys tell me that the average Fat Roland reader reads this blog by mumbling the words out loud. This blog is actually all cut-and-pasted from Ed Sheeran lyrics: has been since 2004, seven years before Sheeran had his first hit single. Sorry to break it to you, my muttering friend, but by reading this very page, you're already making the Suffolk superstar the most played artist of 2020.In two of his singles, Shape Of You (not bad) and Galway Girl (terrible), he makes a reference to putting Van Morrison on a jukebox. People aren't paying attention. They're putting Ed on their jukeboxes, not Van. They're putting Ed on their record players. They're putting Ed on their Spotify. They're putting Ed in those annoying birthday cards that make a tinny noise when you open them. Ed everywhere. Ed will never end. He is Ed Sheer-on-and-on.Further Fats: Rihanna has ruined everything (2012)Further Fats: U Can't Touch The UK Charts: an MC Hammer infographic (2014)"},

Its curated playlists seem to recognise my musical moodswings from gloomy techno to big gay pop anthems. It's easy enough to avoid its more ridiculous categories such as \"At Home\", which is as nonsensical as defining your listening experience as \"Standing On The Floor\" and \"Leaning On A Hedge\".However, it has recently been trying to flog me hamster buckets instead of my favourite wasp-based clothing accessories. Not literally: it's a metaphor. Keep up.Here's an example. The Grid is a brilliant dance project by Richard Norris and Soft Cell's Dave Ball, but instead of popping classics such as Floatation and Crystal Clear into my recommendations, it's been trying to push some unrelated rock band of the same name.I get all excited when I see a Grid track I don't recognise, and when I click on it, all I get is some unrelated guitar dirge that makes me want to drag my ears through broken glass. And because I've played it, Spotify recommends them some more, locking me into an impostor loop that can only end if I throw my computer into a fire.This happened again the other day, this time with Orbital. According to Spotify, the latest release from Orbital is a track called Mystical River. This is not an Orbital track: it is a fake; it is Trojan horse; it is a cuckoo's egg in the nest of my musical egginess. It's Spotify getting it wrong again.As you can see from the picture at the top of this blog post, Richard Hughes the alien is furious about the incorrect listing. Who is Richard Hughes the alien? I drew him because just posting a Spotify screenshot would have been as dull as heck. He now exists. Everyone say hello to Richard Hughes the alien.This isn't Spotify's only failing, of course. There are other user annoyances, such as the lack of ability to browse by label, even though a browse of, say, DFA or Warp would be really useful. And Spotify earn musicians so little money, they appear to want every musician to wear rags, work up chimneys and snort gruel.Computers are very clever, but they are also eye-wateringly dumb. I recently subscribed to Now TV, and now my internet is packed with adverts telling me to subscribe to Now TV. That's like going into a newsagent, popping a Twix on the payment counter, and the newsagent screaming at you \"buy a Twix, buy a Twix\". I'm buying one, for crap's sake, lay off me. Also could I get a packet of Rizla? Thanks.This is a reminder that algorithms can only ever be algorithms. We need to rediscover personal recommendations: proper ones from humans. As shops reopen across the UK, there are insanely experienced booksellers and record shop assistants and handbag wasp experts just waiting to give you the benefit of their years of experience. Use them. Spotify has its plus sides, but it can't tell great music from a bucket of fluff.Further Fats: Mr and Mrs Spotify plug my oozing holes (2011)Further Fats: How does Spotify work?

{"title": "The quarantine raves: Top one, nice one, get Covid?", "date": "Jun 14, 2020", "text": "A bunch of people in Greater Manchester went raving last night. This would not normally be news because, as we all know, 100% of people in Manchester are raving 100% of the time.However, these raves happened in the middle of the pandemic, and it's kinda not okay. A tonne of party-goers descended on two sites in Trafford and Oldham for 'quarantine raves'. Several videos on Snapchat caught lots of revellers half-heartedly swaying to fairly commercial dance music. In the aftermath, Warehouse Project founder Sacha Lord slammed them as \"morons\" and \"selfish idiots\", while local volunteers collected over 200 bin bags of rubbish from the mess they had left behind. He's right. Top one, nice one, get Covid? If you went to one of the raves last night, you're a wrong 'un.I understand the need to be at events like this. Hold on. Let me clarify. I wouldn't be caught dead at crappy park raves where WKD-glugging drones cheer as the DJ drops Get Lucky. But I do get the need to go to places with speaker stacks banging out tunes; to feel the heat of the bodies, the music and the lukewarm sweat dripping off the ceiling. I miss clubbing.But surely us ravers can keep our glow-sticks in our pants for a bit longer? The more these Superdry-wearing sub-Parklife plonkers go to illegal raves like this, inevitably spreading the virus because that's how viruses work, the longer the rest of us wait until we don our party pants. And the longer the club industry will take to recover.It has also occurred to me that if Covid hangs around for a long time, we may never go raving again. We'll have to go to clubs in human-size hamster balls, zorbing our orbs against each other like a kinky lottery machine. It sounds weirdly appealing, but raising our hands in the air like we just don't care is going to be a logistical nightmare.I can cope with people protesting in large numbers for #BlackLivesMatter, because that is about a threat that is every bit as immediate as this pesky virus. If you disagree with that sentence and you're white, you've just proved the need for #BlackLivesMatter. But a bunch of rave babies dancing to low-rent wedding reception dance music because they feel stronger than the virus? No thanks. It's like they listened to the chorus of Rozalla's Everybody's Free without paying attention to the verse: \"We are a family that should stand together as one / Helping each other instead of just wasting time.\" Together is a metaphor: that means staying home, you clubbing Covidiots. Also, I bet that was the only track the DJs had: just Rozalla over and over again.If you want to support Greater Manchester clubbing instead of frightening a bunch of hedgehogs in a field in the middle of the night, then support United We Stream.Edit: Since posting this, the news story has advanced. In addition to the idiocy of a quarantine rave, there have been some pretty serious crimes at these events.

And when I go to bed, I like to fall asleep and dream.Shakespeare said \"to sleep, perchance to dream\", and I think he was waffling about death, but whatever the ruffed berk was on about, he clearly found dreams fascinating. And so do I. Especially when the dream stays in my memory in the first moments of the day; a lingering afterglow of imagined nonsense.If I find a dream particularly memorable, I tend to post about it on Twitter. So I did some homework. I trawled through my entire Twitter history to find all of my tweets about my dreams. So, a special treat for psychologists everywhere, and perhaps as a tribute to 808 State's excellent 1989 track Magical Dream, here is...Fat Roland's top 20 magical dreamsA list of my dreams as posted on Twitter over the past 11 years, in no particular order. This is all genuine. Brace yourself. 1. The record collectionLast night, I dreamt I was showing someone my record collection - but the only record I had was I'd Rather Jack by The Reynolds Girls (pictured above).2. Fridge problemsLast night I dreamt Robert Plant sneaked into my fridge and did a poo in my Yopp.3. On the busDreamt I met Debbie McGee on the 142 bus. She was very nice despite being overburdened with shopping.4. The classic albumLast night, I dreamt I had a listening party with all of my friends so we could reappraise the \"game-changing Manic Street Preachers album with all the Red Hot Chili Peppers songs on\".5. The brush offLast night, I dreamt that every time I used a broom, I chucked it away. I had a bin full of brooms.6. Career choiceLast night, I dreamed I became a hairdresser by mistake.7. At the club Last night I dreamt I was at a club night. Every so often, Grace Jones would patrol the room to check no-one was smoking. 8. At the memorialLast night's dream: I got asked by my local pub to say a few words at a George Formby memorial event. I said yeah fine, I know all about him, I'll not prepare, I'll just wing it. As I walk into the stage, I realise I know nothing about Formby: I was thinking of Bobby Ball.9. Waking nightmareLast night I had a nightmare in which I dreamt Mumford & Sons was a real thing and then I woke up and it was true.10. The raceDreamt I was racing spiders. (I won.)11. Definitely my egoLast night I dreamed I was giving motivational leadership speeches in a car wreckage yard whose electronics were powered by a Nook E-reader.12. At the pubLast night I dreamt I went to the pub for a meal. Covid made it way too stressful. Don't touch that, don't queue there, don't lick that, don't stick that in there. Also, @jpmdaly was having a pint with Lou Reed, which just made everything worse.13. Phone levelsLast night I dreamed my phone battery was at 25% but when I woke up it was at 46% not 25%. 14. In EdinburghJust awoken from a dream in which every Edinburgh pedestrian was dressed as an egg. Big oval costumes with leg holes, but no arm holes or eye holes. Chaos.15. Someone else's record collectionHad a dream that I was DJing, but I forgot all my records. I had to use @fullofpenguins' vinyl instead but all he had was 30 copies of Female Of The Species by Space.16. Possibly satireAll I dreamt about last night were zombie bankers molesting me with their elephant trunks.17. On Christmas EveWas intending to be a good boy and go to midnight communion, but fell asleep and dreamt of breakcore instead.18. A bit darkLast night I dreamt horses were on fire. I asked an elderly couple if I could borrow their duvet cover to smother the flames. They refused.19. The grime MCLast night, I dreamt that Jme released a new single, but it was underneath a pavement and as a result a bunch of Dutch people lost an election inside an ice cream van.20. All too realDreamt last night that my blog got deleted and that the entire world banking system collapsed causing poverty everywhere. My blog.

Luke Vibert (pictured) has announced a trilogy, like Lord Of The Rings, The Matrix and the Police Academy films when there were only three of them.The albums are intended to be a PTSD-style flashback to the golden years of electronic music. Last month, Luke Vibert Presents Amen Andrews took us into the old-school jungle, and next month's Rave Hop will be packed to the brim with breakbeat. June's offering is Modern Rave, which is centred around... *checks notes* ...rave. Obviously.I mentioned jungle just then. This reminded me of a crazy Twitter moment a few months ago when I referred to an Orbital track as \"lightly junglist\". \"That’s not jungle though,\" tweeted a random stranger. No, it's not jungle mate. It's \"lightly junglist\", in the same way a \"lightly drizzled\" cake doesn't mean the cake is drizzle.This stranger insisted that instead of posting tracks that are lightly sprinkled with a jungle vibe, I should post actual jungle tracks, or as he put it, the \"choonage to represent the scene and industry, otherwise it’s an insult in certain circles\". He then called me a moron who was single-handedly bringing the music industry to its needs. Reader, I blocked him.Let's have some drum 'n' bass, which is a bit like jungle but isn't jungle. I loved Goldie collaborator J Majik's last album Full Circle. It was his first album for 20 years and it was a cracker. Look out for his new album Always Be, which should serve as a great companion to Full Circle, like double-yolked eggs or Jedward brothers.And then there's Trickfinger's She Smiles Because She Presses The Button, which is a new album of solo electronics from John Frusciante. John who? He's the bloke from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, statistically the band most listened to by white boys with dreadlocks. The 'Peppers are as dull as spending an afternoon watching cricket with a Tory, but Frusciante has IDM credentials, so it's worth a listen. Remember when he worked with Venetian Snares?There's also Shaw & Grosfeldt's Klavier, which is Simian Mobile Disco's Jas Shaw faffing around with a sensor-fitted Disklavier piano. And there's a new album of bassy electronics from Budapest sound artist Gábor Lázár: Source is a follow-up to 2018’s excellent Unfold.Finally, there's some proper industrial helt going on with Helena Hauff's Kern Vol.5, a various artists mix for Tresor’s Kern series, including some exclusively unreleased tracks. The whole thing is lightly junglist. I mean, it's not: that's an inaccurate description, but I just want to annoy the choonage moron randomer.Trickfinger - She Smiles Because She Presses The Button by TrickfingerFurther Fats: Bleep Years day nineteen: LTJ Bukem's Horizons (1995) (posted in 2012)Further Fats: A tribute to Andrew Weatherall: imagine a cake, a simple cake (2020)"},

It's hard to go wrong when you're picking 100 highlights from fewer than 1,500 songs, most of which are hogwash. Take a random year as an example: 1999 number ones by Chef, The Offspring, Boyzone or the Mambo No 5 bloke were hardly going to trouble the list.Pet Shop Boys' topped their poll, which is entirely the correct choice. Their take on Elvis's Always On My Mind has an incredible energy, like a firework exploding in the boot of a car – I've always considered this the best Christmas number one, so I'm happy to extend it to the best chart topper of all time. Sadly, the Guardian opted for West End Girls as the greatest number one; any fool knows that the other PSB number ones, Heart and It's A Sin, are better than 'Girls. Pfffrt. Just you wait till I get you home, The Guardian.The Chemical Brothers were just inside their top 50, while the Prodigy soared into their top ten, troubling the likes of Michael Jackson and the Human League. Steve 'Silk' Hurley's Jack Your Body was also in the mix, with it being labelled as \"the most minimal No 1 of all time\". Black Box and Daft Punk were included, although the latter's only number one song is hardly their best.Killer made it into their list, with the Guardian praising its perfect design, as did I just last week. Kraftwerk's The Model is also in there, with a welcome shout-out to its brilliant flip-side Computer Love. And while we're doing k-words, the KLF's 3am Eternal made it quite high up the list, proving the ancients of Mu-Mu still have some mojo. This made me sad that Last Train To Trancentral never got to number one. Still, all of these were great to see.They chose Snap!'s Rhythm Is a Dancer, which I'm sure they were as serious as gout about, but I would have probably have gone for Snap!'s other number one, The Power. That track was so strange and discordant, confusing my head at the time before my heart fell in love with it. The Power knocked Beats International's Dub Be Good To Me off the top spot – another missed contender in this list.They should have included Pump Up The Volume by MARRS, which incidentally stands for band members Martyn, Alex, Rudy, Russell and Steve. They're like ABBA but with less knitwear. The band didn't get on, and it was a miracle they ever released anything, never mind create a chart-topping acid house classic. And how on earth The Guardian missed The Shamen's Ebeneezer Goode, I have no idea.There were some outsider choices I would have like to have seen, and would have no doubt made a top 200. For the 1990s, I love the indie spirit of White Town's pin-sharp Your Woman (\"So much for all your highbrow Marxist ways, just use me up and then you walk away\"), while I mourn the exclusion of Flat Beat by Mr Oizo, which was a blow to yellow puppets everywhere.There are some 21st century outsiders I'd liked to have seen: Rihanna's Diamonds (they chose Umbrella); Duck Sauce's Barbra Streisand; David Guetta's epic Titanium; Tinie Tempah's Scunthorpe-namechecking Pass Out. Nothing much interesting to say about them – I just like the tunes, dammit.Like I say, it's an easy list to generally get right, even for people like me who find it difficult to focus on anything before 1987. And not a single mention of Lou Bega's fifth Mambo, despite its remarkable lyric \"It's all good, let me dump it, please set in the trumpet\".

Here are some highlights from various clubbers in various venues, appended with my comments because I'm a blabbermouth who wants to make everything about me.808 State at G-Mex: \"It was a hell of a gig for us coming from out of town, us small country people... we heard all the same music that we listened to in the clubs of the back and beyond, but on a massive sound system and with a massive crowd of people.\"Growing up in Manchester, it's easy to forget that the city was a bit of a Mecca for people out in the sticks. I went to the Hacienda because it was just down the road – albeit quite a long road. My earliest gig memories were at G-Mex: Radiohead supporting James comes to mind, mainly because it makes me sound cool. I probably went to awful gigs there too.Tangled at the Phoenix: \"It was small and it was dingy and there was sweat dropping off the ceilings... Everyone would end up at the garage at East Lancs getting Ribena, the king of all drinks. That was pretty much my life for about five or six years.\"The Phoenix was very sweaty. We're talking Piers Morgan's armpits when he has the guilty sweats, which is all the time. I did my first ever DJing gig in their bar – I was terrible – and I remember grubby acid techno bashes in the club. I worked near the Phoenix and watched its building get knocked down. It's shops now. On warm summer nights, you can still smell the perspiration.Daft Punk’s first UK live gig: \"Daft Punk played live for the first ever time in Britain and played that song [Da Funk]... Still to this day, the B-side Rollin’ & Scratchin’ is the only song I can never listen to without vomiting.\"When I saw Daft Punk DJ at Sankeys Soap back in the 1990s, a French stranger tried to roll my torso like plasticine while saying \"wide boy, wide boy\". I have nothing more to say about Daft Punk.Devils Dancing: \"I had this strange-shaped pill I bought, which actually turned out to be ketamine... These lights were making red shadows and all I could see were these weird devils dancing, in this weird, satanic fire dance, and my friend took me home.\"I've always stayed away from the more hallucinogenic end of the drugs spectrum. My imagination has always been vivid and strange: my silly creative activities are my way of pressure-cooking that intensity out of my brain. If I didn't have that kind of release, I really would be seeing red devils all over my walls. For now, I just have slightly muted woodchip.Dancing at Sankeys Soap: \"I felt this body come up behind me and start dancing in the same rhythm as me. It got a little bit too close and so I turned round, not forgetting that I’m off me chops, and it was Zammo from Grange Hill.\"So many good nights at Sankeys. And a bad trip that nearly destroyed me. Easy come, easy go. When I took on the name 'Fat Roland', I didn't even think of the Grange Hill connection. I should have gone for something different. Wide Boy, maybe. The forward Frenchman was right. Dammit.I've plenty of memories of clubbing back in the day, so I really should upload something to the Lapsed Clubber Audio Map.

They are:Maxinquaye by TrickyPost by BjorkThe New York Times declared Maxinquaye as the \"first album-length masterpiece\" of trip hop. Spin magazine praised the way Post broke the \"flow of whiny rockers\", while another publication said it set the scene for the incoming cyber age. Two massively important albums. Only one can win.Let's boogie.Criteria one: which album feels too big to fit into a caravan?Nice to see the caravan criteria back, last seen in the quarter-finals. The sheer scope of Post would overwhelm a humble caravan door, thereby impeding entry. And if you told Bjork to get into a caravan, she'd slap you across the schnozzle. But the more I read about Tricky's chaotic recording sessions, the more cluttered Maxinquaye sounds. Fitting his album into a space that small would be like trying to squeeze all your furniture into next door's bird nest. Don't let Tricky anywhere near my caravan: at the very least, he's going to snap a hinge.Winner: MaxinquayeCriteria two: which album cover would make the best face tattoo for Fat Roland?I feel quite sad about face tattoos. Post Malone's \"always tired\" tattoo makes him look, well, always tired. A face tattoo on my podgy boatrace would make me look like a confused balloon or a sofa infested by spiders. Despite my previous fondness for Tricky's red, I really should go for Bjork. I'd look great. I'd look like Bjork. The actual Bjork. \"Mummy, why has that man got a Bjork CD drawn on his face?\" \"Ignore the strange man, Jemima, he's one of those bloggers.\" Yeah. It would be brilliant.Winner: PostCriteria three: which of the two would Jesus listen to?Neither contestant fared well in this judging criteria back in round one, with me finding BT and Autechre more Christ-friendly than Tricky or Bjork. So which of these two heathen long-players deserves the attention of the saviour of the world? Maxinquaye feels more like John the Baptist, prophesying the future in Hell Is Round The Corner. With her evocations of nature and mystery, perhaps Post is more druidic than I'd given it credit for. It's easy to see which one Jesus would plump for. Winner: MaxinquayeCriteria four: which album is best stored in a fridge?In the semi-finals, I was unconvinced about putting Tricky's album in the fridge. There was too much contaminated filth in his dirty beats. And although there's something delicate about Bjork's music, like ice crystals, Post was Bjork in a boisterous mood: \"I won't sympathise anymore,\" she warns. Should someone that feisty be stored near eggs? I'm beginning to think it's Tricky we should keep in the fridge, at least to stop his smoky beats from going off.Winner: MaxinquayeCriteria five: which album has more bangin' choons?Cast your mind back to May 2007. The charts were full of Nelly Furtado and Shakira. On the 1st of that month, I published this blog post declaring that Bjork had released a \"choon\". It was poorly written and didn't really explain what the tune in question was, but it pointed towards Bjork's propensity for bold melodic motifs, clearly evident on Post. Have I ever written a blog post about Tricky releasing a \"choon\"? No, I haven't. Sorry, Tricky.Winner: PostCriteria six: which album has the sexiest track titles?I unfairly compared Maxinquaye to 50 Shades Of Grey in the quarter-finals, while I referred to Bjork's track listing as \"proper phwoar\". And while Tricky's Overcome and Suffocated Love suggest a certain level of bedroom tomfoolery, I really can't deny the sexiness of Bjork's cheeky Enjoy and You've Been Flirting Again. \"This is sex without touching,\" she says. She's talking about her track titles. I bet her record company was very confused.Winner: PostCriteria seven: an honest appraisal of both albumsI would usually cram this final judging criteria (criterium?) with a bunch of random gubbins from Wikipedia. But as a respectful sign-off to this blog series, I thought it would be nice to give some serious consideration to these grand finalists. The 1990s would have felt different if either work had been absent. Tricky consolidated the blunted electronics of the Portishead aesthetic, although you could argue that trip hop in general has not aged well. Bjork made herself a star with her album, which was show-tuned and filmic, although you could argue her most acclaimed work lay elsewhere. Only one of these albums, however, burned like a magnesium fire; a moment of production madness that summed up the hybrid nature of 1995's music scene like nothing else. And no, it's not easy to sing along about eggs to......Winner: MaxinquayeThe best electronic music album of 1995 is: Maxinquaye by Tricky. I reckon six of the 16 albums featured in this contest were serious considerations for first place, but it's former Massive Attacker and trip hop pioneer Adrian 'Tricky' Thaws that takes the title. A thoroughly worthy winner for a genre-crunching, beat-breaking, lyric-smudging work of paranoid perfection. \"Don't wanna be on top of your list,\" says Martina Topley-Bird on Tricky's Overcome. Sorry, Martina. Best of 1995 it is.Further Fats: See the whole Best Albums Of 1995 series here."},
{"title": "Best electronic music albums of 1995: Semi Final 2 – Bjork versus Leftfield", "date": "May 30, 2020", "text": "It's the second semi-final in the ongoing contest to decide the best electronic music album of 1995. I'm too excited to look. Someone blindfold me. Poke out my eyes with spoons. Sellotape me into a box and mail me to Peru. It's all too tense to bear.The winner of this bout will go through to the grand final to meet yesterday's winner. We will then know the best 1995 album and there shall be no more debate. See the series so far here, and see the 16 albums I began with here.As with the last semi-final, I am judging these albums with some slightly unconventional criteria. Hoping to win my semi-thumbs-up in this most semi-gladiatorial of battles is:  Post by BjorkLeftism by LeftfieldThe hyper-balladeer meets the space shantiers. Jeeves, can you please lube up the contestants and place them into the firing cannon of destiny. One shall win. One shall be spurned forever. The semi-final is go.Criteria one: which album is best stored in a fridge?The crystalline atmosphere of Post seems ideal for cold storage, which is a good job because Leftfield lose this on two counts. Firstly, they've got a song called Melt which, let me remind you, is extremely triggering for fridge systems. And they've got some buttery punk loudmouth singing \"burn, Hollywood, burn\". Only Bjork can deliver safe storage for my dairy goodness.Winner: PostCriteria two: which album is the best soundtrack for the lockdown?The violently happy Bjork would be an ideal companion for being stuck at home. You can both just sit there, \"listening to the irritating noises of dinosaurs and people dabbling outside.\" That would have been the best choice, if it weren't for the futurist defiance of Leftism. \"I've got to stand and fight,\" they say. \"Will it ever be the same again?\" they ask. The bold sounds of Leftfield are what we needed to narrate a lockdown.Winner: LeftismCriteria three: which album would make the best birthday present for an elephant?I'm not sure the zoos are open as I write this, so I had to make do with throwing CDs at a horse. The rider was furious, and I waffled something about people in Cheltenham breaking distancing rules, which didn't help. But then I played Bjork's It's Oh So Quiet and the shushing really helped calm the rider down. The horse kicked me in the face, but that's beside the point. I'm sure it could please an elephant.Winner: PostCriteria four: which album's track titles are a secret code to unlock the secrets of the Illuminati?To be honest with you, I wasn't really thinking when I included this judging criteria. I'm not into any of that illuminati nonsense, and I don't think Prince William looks much like a lizard. Leftfield have the chanting lyrics of Afro Left and the dubby spaciness of Storm 3000, while Bjork's track title Army Of Me sounds like a the name of a one-man illuminati conspiracy blog. She wins on the track title technicality. But truly, I'm out of my depth here. If we really are run by a cabal of space blobs, I'd be the last one to notice.Winner: PostCriteria five: which album can you dance the Macarena to?The only song acceptable for dancing the Macarena to is the song Macarena. However, if you are going to flout Macarena rules, then you should probably bust your moves to Leftism. Nothing against Post: the carnival vibes of I Miss You are perfect for repetitive choreography. It's just that Leftfield's beats hit harder and for longer: we're talking an extended, dark, after-hours Macarena. A sexy Macarena. Winner: LeftismCriteria six: Which album cover would make the best face tattoo for Fat Roland?I've always wanted to improve my face: I look like a spud that's been dumped in a river bed. If I had the Bjork album tattooed on my face, then I'd look as good as Bjork, which is very good indeed. If I had the Leftfield album inked on my face, I'd look like some kind of jaw-eyed cyclops. \"I'm a space blob,\" I'd say as people ran screaming. Horses would throw CDs at me. This sounds amazing: Leftfield's all-seeing eye wins.Winner: LeftismCriteria seven: miscellaneous and worryingly randomIn the worst decision since, er, most decisions in the UK for the past ten years, this section is curated using the random page button on Wikipedia. Here goes. Which album looks brownest? Leftfield, despite Bjork being dressed as an envelope. Which album needs a good wash? Bjork because she sings about standing by the ocean. Which album is a reptile? Despite Leftfield's illuminati leanings, it has to be Bjork for the only reason that Isobel is a great name for a turtle. Which album should have been covered by Jerry Garcia? Jerry lived just long enough to see the release of both featured albums – he would have chosen Bjork. Which album should be played in Liw Castle in Poland? Playing Leftfield in a flipping castle? No brainer. Which album could soundtrack a 1930 German thriller? The sheer drama and intensity of Leftfield would be ideal for this. Which album would be the subject of a satirical story by The Onion? For her headline-grabbing antics and \"oh so quiet\" dramatics, Bjork.Winner: PostOverall winner and going through to the grand final: The gap between the contestants was so narrow, you couldn't have fit Bjork dressed as an envelope between them. The winner is Post by Bjork: her amazing Nellee Hooper-produced album elbows its way into the final. I'm gutted to lose Leftfield: they lost the Mercury Music Prize, and now they lost this.16 albums began this contest (see the original 16 here) and only two remain.

If you're not up to date with this, see the series so far here, and see the 16 albums I started off with here. The winner of today's face-off wins a place in the grand final. I've refreshed the judging criteria and, as ever, there is only one person on the judging panel: me. Facing my wrath for this semi-final is:  Timeless by GoldieMaxinquaye by TrickyThe Walsall metalhead meets the Bristolian wild buncher. Let's fire up this sausage and see if it bursts.Criteria one: which album is best stored in a fridge?I feel that if I left Maxinquaye within a mile of my fridge, my butter would be mouldy within minutes. Tricky's got a serious case of cross-contamination in those filthy beats. In contrast, I'd happily nestle Timeless against my yoghurts and tripe. It's a clean album and works best at cool temperatures. I'm not having Goldie in my freezer, though: he'd swipe my Ben & Jerry's. Ice cream's the only thing he can eat, what with those gold teeth.Winner: TimelessCriteria two: which album is the best soundtrack for the lockdown?Both albums trade on a certain level of paranoia, with Goldie's inner city pressure and Tricky's cack load of drugs. Neither can relieve the lockdown but they certainly could reflect it. It's the Tricky album that best sums up the cataclysm that is the Covid crisis in lyrics like \"hell is round the corner where I shelter\" and \"how can I be sure in a world that's constantly changing?\" and \"how do I hide my own view in Zoom?\"Winner: Maxinquaye Tricky · Hell Is Round the CornerCriteria three: which album would make the best birthday present for an elephant?This one is easy. Maxinquaye is custom-made for wrinkly elephants as they trample across muddy plains. Their flat feet drum in trip hop patterns. Listen to them trumpet, the pure fat sound of a– oh hold on, someone's at the door. Back in a mo. ... Ah, sorry, that was Elmer the Elephant and he says Timeless is, and I quote, \"da bomb when I'm toking on a patchwork blunt.\" This one has to go to Goldie. Don't blame me; blame the fictional elephant who coincidentally turned up at my door just now.Winner: TimelessCriteria four: which album's track titles are a secret code to unlock the secrets of the Illuminati?Glad you asked. To detect illuminati coding, we're looking for three things in the titles: lizards, triangles and anything that rhymes with 'David Icke'. Tricky's Abbaon Fat Tracks has four letter As: are these triangles? Would lizards live in Goldie's Sea of Tears, or am I thinking of turtles? I had another listen to Tricky's disturbed whispering throughout his album, and he's definitely unlocking some Dan Brown kinda shizzle right there. He's like a whispering Icke.Winner: Maxinquaye Goldie (Official) · Sea of TearsCriteria five: which album can you dance the Macarena to?For those living in the future, I'm writing this in times of social distancing, so I'm unable to carry out a controlled Macarena experiment on the 143 bus through Withington. However, Goldie's tricksy tripping rhythms are ideal for Los del Río's popular Spanish dance. I can picture it now: ardent arm thrusts, bombastic belly wiggles, underpants flying everywhere, the harrangued bus driver trying to catch me with an oversize fishing net. A mí me gusta!Winner: TimelessCriteria six: Which album cover would make the best face tattoo for Fat Roland?Not having had a tattoo, I'm never quite sure: do you have to draw in the white bits? Thing is, the Goldie album already has a face on, so it should be ideal, but it would end up as a tiny face on the end of my nose and everyone would get confused. I'm often huffed and puffed and red in the cheeks, so if you tatted Maxinquaye across my fizzog, hardly anybody would notice – I'm going for that one.Winner: Maxinquaye Criteria seven: miscellaneous and worryingly randomFor no reason other than I hate you, this final section will be decided using Wikipedia's random page function. Which album would make the best portable flamethrower? Maxinquaye because, as we've established, Timeless is too chilled.  Which album would make a great hockey puck? Maxinquaye because it would be made of Black Steel. Which album has the best nom de plume? Easy: the 'Maxin' bit of Maxinquaye is named after Tricky's mother Maxine. Which album makes the best sewage pump? Timeless because of the (inner city) pressure. Which album would be enjoyed by a southern carpenter bee? Their faces look exactly like the Metalheadz logo, so Timeless. Which album would win the 1999 Qatar Open singles competition? Maxinquaye because he'd be on the (massive) attack.Winner: Maxinquaye Overall winner and going through to the grand final: After a nail-clenching buttock-biting semi-final, Tricky storms it at the end to win a place in the grand final. The album stormed end-of-year polls after its release, so it's very worthy. Alas, for Goldie, the time ran out. Time. Timeless. Time ran out. Geddit?! No. Dammit.The second semi-final will hit the internet faster than a speeding patchwork elephant.

{"title": "Decapitated Seals and Adamski's skinned llama: remembering Killer", "date": "May 28, 2020", "text": "In May 1990, Adamski's Killer knocked Madonna's Vogue off the top spot of the UK singles chart. Madge was too concerned with Greta Garbo and Rita Hayworth, and didn't see the keyboard wizard sneaking up from behind.Killer wasn't just a breath of fresh air: it was a fully-bellowed gust up the jacksie. It was clearly informed by Adamski's rave DJing, but that bass drum / bassline combo was something new. The Italo-house piano, the 909, the bit where Seal's voice goes \"be-ee-e-ee\". So good.The track was recorded amid noisy protests over the Tories' anti-rave legislation. Seal was a penniless singer, while Adamski was relying on the government's Enterprise Allowance Scheme (as was I around that time). Lots of dance music felt politically charged. Killer seemed to suck in all that energy, then blast it out in a fully clubby and commercial way.Watch the original verson with decapitated Seals, young Adamski wearing a skinned llama, and. um. some random science lab tech things.The track was a huge smash. Only four artists outsold Adamski that year: the Righteous Brothers, Sinéad O'Connor, Elton John and king of all rappers Vanilla Ice. The single hit number one in Zimbabwe and Belgium and — wait for it — hit number 112 in Australia. George Michael's bland version brought the track back to UK number one in 1993. I was horrified. It sounded like yer dad discovering your rave records and putting on a live entertainment night with a buffet. Still, I was obsessed with Killer and bought every subsequent cover / remix on vinyl. Even the George Michael one. Sigh.Here's Seal and Adamski appearing on Top of the Pops on Christmas Day 1990. No jeans and a t-shirt with these two. Just look at them. Adamski looks like a little peroxide tearaway and Seal looks like a gymnast biker. Both are in full live flow, with Adamski taking bits of his other tracks and throwing it all into the mix.

{"title": "Essential Hardcore got me started, ahem, on rave music", "date": "May 27, 2020", "text": "When I was a young droog, much of my musical education came from chart rave, and from compilation CDs.One compilation I had forgotten about, until I tripped over the above image online, is 1991's Essential Hardcore. It's image was not original. It had a cherub on the cover, reminding us of New Order's Technique, and the acts listed on the front, a style later copied by terribly-named series The Best... Album in the World...Ever!What was notable was its track curation. The album never leaves strays too far from the environs of commercial dance music, but there's definitely a change in flavour as it progresses.At the start are charty bangers like Rozalla's saxophone-fuelled Faith (In The Power Of Love) and 2 Unlimited's ubiquitous Get Ready For This. Not great. The kind of music that clueless people mention when you say you're into techno.Then we get into classic rave. The likes of Bizarre Inc's Playing With Knives, Altern 8's Activ 8 and Slipmatt & Lime (SL2)'s DJs Take Control, with the London breakbeat's duo's biggest hit On A Ragga Tip still a few months off.By the end of the album, we're into the slightly harder stuff. Lords of Acid's moody and stomping Take Control. Joey Beltram's The Omen (Psycho Mix). And Dutch duo L.A. Style with their jackhammering James Brown Is Dead. It's a great introduction to rave. And the The Shamen's wibbly Possible Worlds was a great way to end the album. Most people only knew them for Move Any Mountain, and this was a gateway drug to their more trippy side.Please let's not talk about the inclusion of Simply Red's Something Got Me Started, though. Crumbs.This was actually the fourth in the Hardcore series, previous iterations being Hardcore Uproar, Hardcore Dancefloor and Hardcore Ecstasy. All of them showed the dark and light side of charty dance music. The first one included Betty Boo, and Together's ravetastic top 20 single Hardcore Uproar, from which the series no doubt got its name.I'm glad I rediscovered this again. Back in the olden days, it was useful to have compilations like this – Essential Hardcore and its sister albums played a key part in young me navigating my music taste.

There are only four of them. The same number as the Beatles or Abba or The Proclaimers looking into a mirror.The following artists didn't make it to this semi-final: Aphex Twin, Moby, the Chemical Brothers, Higher Intelligence Agency, BT, Carl Craig, Global Communication, Sabres of Paradise, Nightmares on Wax, the Black Dog, David Holmes, Autechre and your gran playing the spoons (disqualified before the competition began).Moby got knocked out of the competition because of confusing signals from Eamonn Holmes. The Black Dog fell by the wayside because I compared them to a Viennese Whirl.

{"title": "Best electronic music albums of 1995: Quarter Final 4 – Carl Craig versus Leftfield", "date": "Apr 30, 2020", "text": "What is the best electronic music album of 1995 (see the series so far here)? You no doubt have an opinion, especially if you check out the 16 albums that started this competition off. But opinions are like holiday homes on the Costa Daurada: everyone's got one. The only opinion that matters in this ongoing competition is mine. And if that sounds egotistical, then, er, sorry about that. Yeesh. I'm a real douche.This is the last quarter final before we move into the semi finals. The stakes are high. Today's bout is between:Landcruising by Carl CraigLeftism by LeftfieldCarl Craig and Leftfield both began their careers in 1989, and both went on to shape electronic music. A sped-up spin of Craig's Bug In The Bassbin supposedly lay the groundwork for drum 'n' bass, while the 'field are credited as starting the genre of progressive house. It will be a shame to lose either of them. Brace yourself.Criteria one: which album feels too big to fit into a caravan?Carl Craig pays tribute to his motor city hometown, evoking sunny drives with the window wound down. Following that logic, it would be pretty difficult to fit a road inside a caravan. On the other hand, Leftfield's space shanties evoke an entire universe of texture and colour. Their sound system was so incendiary, it once stripped the plaster off the roof of a venue. Fitting Landcruising into a caravan might be like trying to fit a camel through the eye of a needle, but getting Leftism into that glorified shed would be like shoving a whole flipping solar system into the atoms of the needle itself.Winner: LeftismCriteria two: which album has the best individual noise?Carl Craig's got some great vroom vroom car sounds. I would have preferred choo choo sounds, but sometimes you've just got to take what you're given. Leftfield have barely any transport sounds: not even a tractor. That said, they've got tonnes of strange and wonderful noises: bleepy radar bits on Original; funny bubbly bits on Melt; an electronic wobble board bit on Release The Pressure; and a bit where a guy goes waaaah like he's doing a mad skateboard trick which I suppose technically is a form of transport.Winner: LeftismCriteria three: which album makes your record collection look coolest?I remember Leftism coming out so clearly. It was beautiful chunk of vinyl, and looked superb on my coffee table next to my nose flute. \"Look at this lovely album,\" I would tell visitors. \"Is that a nose flute?\" they would enquire. \"Stop looking at the nose flute,\" I would scream. I didn't get many visitors. Leftfield are cool, but Landcruising looks way cooler. It's dark and mysterious, and the clash of the car emblem and the dot matrix text only raises questions. You'd not keep it on a coffee table: maybe that's why it's cooler.Winner: LandcrusingCriteria four: which album would you play to ward off a tiger?A walkover for Leftfield. They've got John Lydon on their side, threatening to open things up and burn Hollywood to the ground. He's the original Tiger King. If Johnny Rotten was cornered by a snarling tiger, he'd smear it in butter, which tigers famously hate. Carl Craig not only fails to repel tigers, he's a positive tiger magnet. Want proof? He's from Detroit and their baseball team is called the Detroit Tigers: that's how bad he is at warding them off. Useless.Winner: LeftiismCriteria five: which album has the sexiest track titles?Carl Craig's track titles are a bit dry. Home Entertainment, Technology, Mind Of A Machine. I'd imagine a date with this album would result in an early night: me getting into bed on my own while Landcruising fixes the VHS player. Leftism fares a little better: the track titles Open Up, Melt and Release The Pressure could all be mistaken for b-sides to Madonna's Justify My Love. Even then, I'm not terribly excited, even if the Leftfield title Inspection (Check One) is a euphemism lifted straight out of a Carry On film. Oo-er missus.Winner: LeftismCriteria six: Which album would sound best played on the panpipes?The staccato synth stabs of They Were rolled off my panpipes like lemmings off a cliff, and the wandering lackadaisical melody of One Day Soon floated seamlessly into the air like, er, lemmings floating up a cliff. A good result for Carl Craig. And while the opening siren call of Leftfield's Melt was easy to follow, the panpipes sounded naff against their speaker-rattling production. A win for the lemmings, Er, I mean... a win for Carl Craig. Just to clarify, Carl Craig is not a lemming. If anything, he looks like a handsome baby seal.Winner: LeftismCriteria seven: miscellaneous and worryingly randomBecause I'm reckless and want to watch the world burn, this final criteria is generated using Wikipedia's random page function. Which album could scale an Austrian mountain range? Carl Craig because he's land cruising. Which album has fourfold rotational symmetry? Leftism thought their album didn't quite hang together at first, so Carl Craig must be more symmetrical. Which album would win a TV talent show? Leftfield because John Lydon would show off to the judges. Which of the two albums would make the best Mongolian poet? Leftfield's 21st Century Poem may ignore thousands of years of pre-2000 Mongolian history, but at least they have a poem. Which album would make the best Christmas tree to create a home for the cartoon chipmunks Chip n' Dale? Carl Craig and I'm not explaining why.Winner: LandcruisingOverall winner and going through to the quarter-finals: A landsliding win for Leftfield, as they scoop five of the seven sets of judging criteria. Looks like they're the one to beat as they move to next week's semi final. In 2005, Carl Craig released a reedited version of Landcruising called The Album Formerly Known As..., updating some of the sounds, Maybe he was anticipating this very competition. Too little too late, Carl. Too little, too late.Next week, I launch the semi finals of this stupid contest to find the best electronic music album of 1995.

{"title": "Best electronic music albums of 1995: Quarter Final 3 – Bjork versus Aphex Twin", "date": "Apr 29, 2020", "text": "It's time for another quarter final in the competition to find the best electronic music album of 1995. See the series so far here, and see the 16 albums I started off with here. You may well have been in the middle of getting groceries for your grandma, but that doesn't matter right now: dump those shopping bags in the river, take my hand, and let's skip off into the sunset singing \"1995! We feel so alive!\"Today, I pair up two more albums that survived the first round. Only one will make it through to the semi-finals as they face my very strict and, er, sensible judging criteria. Today's contest is between:Post by Bjork...I Care Because You Do by Aphex TwinTwo solo acts who have carved a singularly individual musical path. Two albums that cemented their respective reputations. Two album covers that have their face staring straight into camera. What are they thinking? How do they feel about this contest? Are they wearing anything below the waist? Let battle commence.Criteria one: which album feels too big to fit into a caravan?There's a clear size difference here. Aphex Twin's third album feels insular, as if we're listening to the reverberations of subterranean pipes. In contrast, Bjork's vision feels open and free: rumour has it, she sung one of these songs to the sea and another one inside a Bahamian cave. Okay, caves are quite insular, but the whole landscape of Post feels bigger. Therefore, for obvious reasons, you ain't getting that album inside that dang caravan no matter how much your Uncle Malcolm brags about his spatial awareness.Winner: PostCriteria two: which album has the best individual noise?Both albums are full of great noises. There's a particularly aggressive fart about four minutes into Aphex Twin's The Waxen Pith, and although the ear-piercing feedback on Ventolin is difficult to take, his rusty snare on Start As You Mean To Go On is a real treat. Bjork's album is an aural rollercoaster, and I especially love the plaintive squeals in the beatless first half of Hyperballad. The problem is, no matter how much Bjork tries, the annoying shushing on It's Oh So Quiet undoes all of her noisy efforts.Winner: ...I Care Because You DoCriteria three: which album makes your record collection look coolest?Both albums make your record collection look cool, especially among all your Nolan Sisters twelve-inches and Keane picture discs. Do those things even exist? Aphex Twin has to win this one, because you can dig out this album at a party and sellotape it to your face to make your friends laugh. \"Oh look, you're being Aphex Twin!\" they all chortle as they swig the Blue WKD laced with bleach. \"Oh look, Aphex Twin has poisoned us!\" they gasp as your evil Aphex face smiles back coldly.Winner: ...I Care Because You DoCriteria four: which album would you play to ward off a tiger?The tarnished techno rhythms of ...I Care Because You Do are enough to scare off any big cat. Leopards are particularly wary of MIDI-enabled synthesisers. Meanwhile, Post saw Bjork embracing a bigger sound, giving her only top ten hits of her career. She even became a whole army (\"If you complain once more, you'll meet an army of me\"). She may have teamed up with Graham Massey and Tricky (see Tricky's quarter final here), but Army of Bjork needs no help: that poor tiger is history.Winner: PostCriteria five: which album has the sexiest track titles?Excuse me while I don my polka dot negligee so I can judge this section properly. Bjork's track titles are proper phwoar. You've Been Flirting Again. Cover Me. I Miss You. Enjoy. I bet Aphex Twin is the sexiest, though. Let's have a look at his track titles. Oh. Er. Wax The Nip. That's about it for sexiness, and I'm not sure nipple waxing is sexy. We're talking the actual nipple rather than any hair growth around it, right? It's going to chafe. I feel very un-phwoar. I'm changing back into my boiler suit. Winner: PostCriteria six: Which album would sound best played on the panpipes?I'm sorry, I mistook the question. I thought you said bagpipes. I've been blowing into the business end of this sheep for no reason (I couldn't find actual bagpipes). The farmer's going to be furious, especially after last week with the cow and the homemade trebuchet. Look, I haven't got time to judge this criteria properly. I'm pretty sure you could mix some panpipes into Aphex's twisted analogue tapestries, so let's call it a win for him. Today I learned that sheep don't go \"toot\". Who knew?!Winner: ...I Care Because You DoCriteria seven: miscellaneous and worryingly randomThis final section is subject to Wikipedia's random page function. Here goes. Which album will kill you? Bjork, especially if you're a photographer (special topical joke, I thank you). Which album would win at the 1948 Summer Olympics? Aphex Twin because his body is (acrid avid jam) shredded. Which album is the most Russian? Aphex has a Siberian coldness, and his track titles certainly look Google-translated from Russian. Which album is best for women's empowerment? Bit of an open goal, this one: it's Bjork. Which album is a luminous red giant? We're back to the landscape thing again: I bet Bjork recorded some of her album on a distant star.Winner: PostOverall winner and going through to the quarter-finals: This was the toughest decision of the competition so far: I've so much love for both of these albums. The Aphex album is endlessly playable, but Post saw the creation of a global pop celebrity and the eradication of tigers from most beaches and caves. Bjork scrapes the win and moves to the semi finals. There's one more quarter final in this best-of-1995.

{"title": "Best electronic music albums of 1995: Quarter Final 2 – Tricky versus Moby", "date": "Apr 28, 2020", "text": "Put down that egg sandwich and pay attention. It's time for the second quarter final in my contest to find the best electronic music album of 1995. No, you may not put it in the fridge. The only thing that matters is this music battle in which I, Fat Roland, play judge, jury and executioner.There are only a handful of contenders left. I won't spoil the results so far: you can see the whole series here and see the introduction to the quarter finals here. This second quarter final is between:Maxinquaye by TrickyEverything Is Wrong by MobyThat's a cracking contest. The difference couldn't be greater: a muttering misery guts versus a happy clappy techno idiot. Fire versus ice. Oil versus water. Cillit versus Bang. There hasn't been a binary choice like this since, er, sorry, I can't think of any controversial votes that have happened in recent years. Here goes. A place in the semi finals beckons...Criteria one: which album feels too big to fit into a caravan?Assuming we're talking about a single-axle caravan of no more than six metres nose to tail, the route for entry is usually through a single doorway of no more than 57 centimetres across and 170 centimetres in height. The insular nature of Tricky's sound, forever sounding like an imploding bong trip, guarantees easy entry: it's music made for hunched shoulders. Meanwhile, there's no way Moby's ever getting through that door, not with all that glorious hands-in-the-air star-jumping rave exuberance.Winner: Everything Is WrongCriteria two: which album has the best individual noise?In audio terms, these albums are poles apart. Moby's noise is based on charming artificiality, with its use of vocal samples and preset-style fake strings. I rather liked the moody \"lets\" at the start of Moby's Let's Go Free, but for the most interesting sounds, we must turn to Tricky. Slurred lyrics, stoned whispers, scuffed snares, awkwardly tripping loops and, best of all, the depressed, descending tooty sound woven through Suffocated Love. What a treat.Winner: MaxinquayeCriteria three: which album makes your record collection look coolest?Eamonn Holmes is flicking through your records. \"Woah, dude,\" he says, with Moby's blue face staring gormlessly up at him. He continues rifling through your albums. \"Like, woooah, dude,\" he says, looking at the distressed red tones of Tricky's album. You want to ask him which album cover was the coolest, but now he's just sitting on your record player drooling at a crack on the wall. You suspect he thought Tricky was coolest. It's hard to tell these days with Eamonn. Winner: MaxinquayeCriteria four: which album would you play to ward off a tiger?The trick is to look at the tiger's face. It flinches as I play the thrash metal bits of Everything Is Wrong, but there's something of a Tigger-energy to Moby's pre-Play career, and I can't help feeling that, despite its initial surprise, the tiger's emotionally connecting somehow. On the other hand, it finds Maxinquaye disorienting; there are too many layers, tonal changes and confusing human voices. Look at its left eye twitch. That tiger's not happy.Winner: MaxinquayeCriteria five: which album has the sexiest track titles?With tracks called Overcome and Black Steel, Tricky's album sounds like a sequel to 50 Shades Of Grey; as sexy as a Tory party conference. The sexiness of Moby's titles is much more direct: All That I Need Is To Be Loved, Everytime You Touch Me, Bring Back My Happiness. Lights off, clothes off, rattle the bedposts, showered in time for mackerel for tea. And God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters sounds like a classic next-day-in-the-office sexual conquest boast.Winner: Everything Is WrongCriteria six: Which album would sound best played on the panpipes?Maxinquaye is a jumble of pitch-shifted sounds and glitches; it defies any normal logic. Everything Is Wrong is the polar opposite: the songs run from A to B, using well-recognised songwriting tropes. If I let Tricky anywhere near my panpipes, he'd probably turn them into a bassoon or an ashtray or a farmstead on the Isle of Jura. Things would be much more straightforward with Moby. A tune is a tune. Panpipes means panpipes.Winner: Everything Is WrongCriteria seven: miscellaneous and worryingly randomThis final section is generated using Wikipedia's random page button. Which of the two albums could cause an earthquake? Moby, because he's got God on his side. Which album is most likely to be eaten by moths? Tricky: it sounds pretty bitten already. Which album floats best? Moby, because he's moving over the face of the waters. Which album is the most Senegalese? Tricky's Bristol is slightly closer to Senegal than Moby's Harlem, so Tricky gets this one. Which album is best for soundtracking Asterix comics? Tricky sounds thoroughly dosed in Getafix's potions.Winner: MaxinquayeOverall winner and going through to the quarter-finals: Tricky trundles through to the semi finals. The Moby album is a personal favourite of mine, but Tricky's album is one of the most acclaimed debut albums of all time: it deserves the win. Isn't that right, Eamonn? Hey, Eamonn. He's not listening – He's climbed into the fireplace again. Silly Eamonn.

The horse says, \"Have you seen Fat Roland's competition for the best electronic music album of 1995?\" The nun says, \"Why the long face?\" The horse says, \"You do this every time, Alison, why do you never listen to me?\" Ignore those two idiots: they're hogging the queue to the bar. My best-of-1995 battle is back on track. Strap in, music fans.We started with 16 albums and now it's time for the first quarter final. See the series so far here, and see the introduction to the quarter finals here. The choice is between:Freefloater by Higher Intelligence AgencyTimeless by GoldieThe Higher Intelligence Agency (HIA) beat the legendary Sabres Of Paradise to get this far, while Goldie knocked out The Chemical Brothers. Two giant-killers, and only one will survive through to the semi finals. We have brand new judging criteria, and special thanks must go to @benjaminjudge, @JacksonWylde and @viaduct_theatre for suggesting criteria two, four and six respectively. Slap on that vaseline, it's time to fight.Criteria one: which album feels too big to fit into a caravan?The squiggly IDM of Higher Intelligence Agency, with its filters squeezed into ever-narrowing frequency bands, would be small enough to fit into a matchbox, never mind a caravan. Stick it under the Calor Gas, sorted. On the other hand, Goldie's Timeless is all about bombast, dynamism and volume. The opening track is 21-minutes wide: you'd not even get that into the entrance of the campsite. There's no travelling light with the monster that is Timeless.Winner: TimelessCriteria two: which album has the best individual noise?Goldie's sound defined an era of drum 'n' bass, and so his album has some ear-bending moments. At one end are the heavenly suspended strings pulling everything taut, while at the other end there's some really ugly crying on Tears. The best single sound are the vocals crescendoing in at the start of State Of Mind as if catapulted from a distant satellite. Higher Intelligence Agency's work is full of great noises, with their squawks and boings and tickly acid (just listen to Elapse), but nothing beats Goldie.Winner: TimelessFreefloater by Higher Intelligence AgencyCriteria three: which album makes your record collection look coolest?I have a real issue with how Timeless looks. I know embedding a Metalheadz logo in a perspex vagina was the coolest thing ever in 1995, but it hasn't aged well. Whereas, if I was flicking through your records and happened across Freefloater, I'd be intrigued. The cover looks like an impressionist Blue Peter ship, and the speech marks around the track title give it an added irony. Yeah. Pretty cool if you ask me.Winner: FreefloaterCriteria four: which album would you play to ward off a tiger?Let me think this one through. I turn down the side of Lidl and there's a striped, snarling beastie blocking my cut-through to the chiropodist. How do I fight the tiger? I could batter its face with HIA's bloopy beats, but that would only annoy it, and I don't want to run because I haven't got to the chiropodist yet. Goldie's beats might skip along more breezily, but they're much heavier. A fat snare drum right in its snout should do it. Take THAT, tiger.Winner: TimelessCriteria five: which album has the sexiest track titles?With titles like State Of Mind and Jah the Seventh Seal, Goldie's track listing brings to mind the tantric liaisons of sexy Sting. Then again, he might start singing, so let's see how sexy the HIA track titles are. Fleagle. Hubble. Ting. Skank. Hmmmm. Less high class escort agency, more a fleshy fumble in a fag-stained Travelodge. Tough decision. The HIA album has \"floater\" in its title, which is the unsexiest thing ever. Sting, you've pulled.Winner: TimelessCriteria six: Which album would sound best played on the panpipes?Complete disaster. I was halfway through the squealing sirens of Goldie's nasty Saint Angel and I dropped my panpipes down the toilet. The bleepy melodies of HIA, especially on Ting, were much easier to handle, despite my pipe-holes being a little damp. I'd wipe them down with bog roll, but, y'know, rationing and all that. I really must find a room in my gaff with better acoustics.Winner: FreefloaterCriteria seven: miscellaneous and worryingly randomAs with the first round, this final judging criteria is guided by Wikipedia's random page function. Which album flies highest? HIA is literally \"Higher\": it's in the title, duh. Which album makes the best Christmas music? Easy: there's a jolly festivity to HIA while Goldie's more Good Friday, alas. Which album could be prime minister of India? Goldie's led an orchestra, so surely he could do that as well. Which album helps with the scientific study of insects? HIA is the only one I can imagine beetles dancing to. Which album is secretly a Norwegian footballer? I guess This Is A Bad describes Norway's FIFA World Cup results, so Goldie it is. Winner: FreefloaterOverall winner and going through to the quarter-finals: No penalty shoot-out here: Goldie goes through to the semi-finals, winning four of the seven criteria. He will face whoever wins the second quarter final. Sad to see you go, Higher Intelligence Agency.

Since I finished that first round, the entire of civilisation seems to have collapsed, and we are left with just eight albums gingerly staggering towards the quarter finals. It is now time for those quarter finals. The following albums will face each other daily in a battle so apocalyptic, a butterfly will faint on the other side of the universe.

The panel consists of, in no particular order:1. Me.2. Er...3. That's it. That's right. It's a dictatorship. It's a despotic autocracy. It's a flipping con.

I owned it 25 years ago and it got nicked. Fancied a bit of format nostalgia.Look at this cover (above). The bold patterns, the trippiness, the blobbiness, the suggestion of a face. All very tribal. Only thing is, once you open up the inlay, things get... different.Inside front cover. So far so good. A nice pretty picture of a record box frolicking in a field, some weird shapes. The text at the bottom is a bit difficult to read, but things aren't so bad, right?Pow! Things take a curious direction. Dark pink blobby text against a green background. I *so* remember owning this CD; it's all coming back to me. Squinting next to our hi-fi unit in the living room wondering if my eyes were broken.On the next two pages pictured above, we even have the muddy pink overlaid on the eye creature. Even for the druggy days of Megadog and Tribal Gathering, this was a, er, bold design choice.Are these inlay credits? Are those blobs letters? I respect the commitment to narrowing the paragraph for easier reading, but this feels like playing Scrabble in the middle of a food fight. I *will* read this, dammit.Actually, momentarily things get easier. The orange arrives like a ray of light, as does the pretty Technics record deck nestling in some grass. Although the orange phases awkwardly against the green, the gangrenous pink is over. Except... except...What do we have here? This is a proper old school CD inlay - you can write off to a mailing list. Oh joy! Let's see the form, shall we! *eyes fall out* This further pink-green tomfoolery might be horrific, but how CUTE are those dots?!Maybe the pink wasn't the best choice. Yes, I've taken the mickey, but this most alien of techno albums wouldn't be the same with any other artwork. I scanned this inlay for a good reason: I am hugely fond of this difficult artwork. Back in the day, great techno was all about being obtuse: wonky beats, anonymous producers, dark smoky rooms, wild originality. This Drum Club CD is all about that. An album for the weird party kids. So I want MORE pink scraped from the innards of a hippopotamus. I want more weird blobs. I want more credits you've got to make a real effort to read — and you do make the effort, because you love it. I'm so glad I ordered this CD with the strangest of designs.Final thing.

{"title": "Ten amazing albums that influenced my taste in music", "date": "Apr 21, 2020", "text": "My blogging schedule's gone a bit sideways because the Covid-19 lockdown has, like many other people, left me quite out of sorts. My capacity for creativity is pretty limited.So I'm going to steal something I did on Facebook. And then we'll get back to the best-of-1995 thing.My brother Grum tagged me in a Facebook challenge to name ten albums that influenced by taste in music. Here's what I posted, edited to make it more interesting than wot I said on Facebook. 1 – The Orb's Adventures Beyond The UltraworldI remember playing this on my cassette walkmen in my tent on family holidays. So surreal to be in some random Welsh field and to get this amazing, otherworldly collages playing in my young ears.2 – Transglobal Underground's Dream Of 100 NationsThis strange mix of UK techno and African tribalism and things from other planets. \"Watch the skies! Keep looking!\" I went to see TGU a couple of years ago and they were phenomenal.3 – Drum Club's Everything Is NowThe album that truly made me fall in love with the bass drum for bass drum's sake, an appreciation that served me well in many a club. Thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump....4 – Orbital's brown album. Here's the one that changed everything for me. My Damascene moment. The album that hardwired techno and all its variants into my brain for life. And look at me now. I'm **twitch** FINE.5 – The Irresistible Force's Flying HighMixmaster Morris's hypnotic ambience lifted me into heady clouds of dubby ambience: I haven't quite come down since. The kind of album that lives in my veins. I also liked things with circles on. See also Banco de Gaia.6 – The Goons' Ying Tong SongNo, really. This is cheating because it's an EP not an album, and it was a family hand-me-down rather than something I bought myself, but it's worth it because THIS IS WHAT MY BRAIN IS LIKE ALL OF THE TIME.7 – Adamski's Doctor Adamski's Musical PharmacyI have to say, this is NOT a good album, despite the presence of Killer and NRG. But Adamski's DIY 'keyboard wizard' approach introduced my little Smash Hits brain to the concept of the bedroom studio a long time before doing that was a viable option.8 – Underworld's dubnobasswithmyheadmanAn obvious one for other fans of 90s techno, but what a strange animal at the time. I was already a fan of their 12-inches and I keenly devoured Junior Boy's Own's early output. All that gorgeous Tomato design work too. Cor.9 – LTJ Bukem's Logical Progressions seriesDrum 'n' bass was always a trip, and even now the thought of this series gives me tingles. My few short years as a drum 'n' bass DJ were some of my happiest creative times. The best sound, the best live experience, and the best to mix. 10 – Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works 85-92Pretty obvious, this one. That bass in Ageispolis. Oooooo.And so many more, of course. Ten will do for now. That's it. I'm creatively spent. I've run out of words. Flong. Pathoot. Clibbibuuuu. See? It's just noise.I'm off for yet another night of stupidly vivid lockdown dreams.Further Fats: Chosen Words: B is for Boss Drum (2010)Further Fats: Don't be rattled: it's just drum 'n' bass (2016)"},

I've inserted the image below this post rather than aligned alongside the text because Blogger's fancy new user interface has made a right royal mess of image manipulation.I'm not sure where this image came from as the original tweeter from 2016, who I think must own this scan, has disappeared. The clip was posted again a few days ago, which then got a signal-boost from movie reviewer Mark Kermode who then, in his words, heard from \"a load of sanctimonious, humourless, preachy, self-pitying whingebag\" Morrissey fans.Because music editing was once my full-time job, I can only see this reviews section with the eyes of an editor / writer. It's totally the kind of silliness I would have wanted to put into Smash Hits magazine. The angle is clear. Get someone stereotyped for being vacuous to talk about indie bands so that the unwashed guitar kids can snigger into their sleeves. Classic 1980s music magazine humour. To be fair to Fox, her Duane Eddy comparison is a pretty fair one, and in that final sentence of the Panic review, she's got Morrissey's number. Even now, he really does go moan, moan, moan, but no longer in a fey 1980s wilting gladioli way. In a more sinister way. Yeeugh.

Order the issue 64 print edition here, or upgrade to the version with the vinyl if you're feeling fancy.I got to illustrate my column again this month, but instead of an illustration, I just took a photograph of Kraftwerk with a load of teapots (see above). What? Yes, it's an actual photograph. It only looks like a cartoon because of the photo realism.The picture is relevant to the content of the column, honest. Not that I know much about teapots. I've never owned one. I had some builders in once, so bought a box of teabags, the only tea bags I've ever bought. I used two teabags nervously making tea for the builders and let the rest of the box go past its use-by date. Tea is horrible, and I'd rather drink healthy stuff like Pepsi, Blue Nun or Toilet Duck.I probably shouldn't title this blog post \"Teapots\". It'll kill any Google ranking. And one thing I've learnt from fifteen and a half years of blogging is how to get hits by doing a words good proper. Is writing about tea popular on the internet? Do people google 'tea'? If I keep mentioning tea, will people arrive on this blog post looking for information about tea?Anyway, that's the blog post (not actual post). Thanks for reading.Further Fats: Tick tick tick tick bleep (2012 – the first Electronic Sound)Further Fats: Why did the Fat Roland cross the road?

The equivalent of a cavalcade of Celine Dion albums smashing into your face until the end of time. But every now and then, there is a moment of hope. A silver lining around the cloud of guff. That glimmer of goodness came in this tweet: Orbital are chatting to Dick and Dom. Everything's going to be okay. pic.twitter.com/Z6ksQLllyC— Fat Roland (@FatRoland) April 2, 2020  And here it is again with, for reason whatsoever, kittens: That's right. Techno behemoths Orbital had a nice how-do-you-do exchange with children's telly legends Dick and Dom. I suspect a collaboration is afoot. Acid Pants In Da Bungalow. Satan In Da Bungalow. Da Box In Da Bungalow. You get the idea. Orbital once made a video with Play School presenter Brian Cant. Play School had different shaped windows for children to look through, no doubt reflecting the big-fish small-fish cardboard-box shapes made by ravers. Also, they had a giant egg person called Humpty, which sounds like a standard hallucination at Shroom if you ask me. Shroom was a nightclub, by the way. It was important in the development of acid house and that happy smiley face symbol you see everywhere. Shroom rhymes with Button Moon, which was a children's programme about a pot-headed man who had astral visions and spent most of his time using kitchen utensils to get high.As I said in that Brian Cant blog post, kid's characters have played a part in club culture. The Prodigy sampled Charly the cat for their debut hit in 1991, and Global Communication's Mark Pritchard scored an early top ten as Shaft with a raved-up Roobarb And Custard theme tune. My most scratched seven-inch, destroyed from overuse, is probably Smart E's druggie kids anthem Sesame's Treet. You can guess what that samples.I'll get back to my 1995 albums contest soon. I just thought I'd share this moment of levity amid the chaos. A happy face amid the scowls. A thumbs-up amid the angry fists. A sunbeam amid the drizzle. A parking space amid the lack of parking spaces. A nice pair of trousers amid the dirty undies. Ew.

{"title": "Best electronic music albums of 1995: Global Communication versus Leftfield", "date": "Mar 29, 2020", "text": "Welcome to the last opening heat to find the best electronic music album of 1995. See the series so far here, and see the 16 albums I started off with here. After this post, we'll get to the quarter finals. This was only to meant to last a week: it's been a month since I started, and the whole of civilisation has collapsed in the meantime. By the time we reach the grand final, Earth will be a shrivelled husk drifting aimlessly through the frozen far reaches of space. All is doomed. Let's play some albums!Here are the final two choices that haven't faced my keen-eared criticism yet:Remotion by Global CommunicationLeftism by LeftfieldUh oh. A slightly niche remix project long out of circulation versus a Mercury Prize-nominated behemoth that defined 1990s dance music culture. This truly is a David and Goliath battle. It's King Canute in his deckchair facing the incoming tide. It's that Skywalker bloke against all those horrible people in helmets that had the big metal ball in space, y'know, the one that wasn't a moon. Let the battle commence.Criteria one: which album would make a better biscuit?The Global Communication album comprises remixes of acts such as Chapterhouse and The Grid, and certainly has the kind of pick-and-mix attitude worthy of the crumbly world of biscuits. However, scratch under the surface, and it's not much more than a coconut-flavoured Nice. The Leftfield album, meanwhile, packs more of a varied flavour palate: it is Ginger Nuts, Oreo and Wagon Wheels combined.Winner: Leftfield Criteria two: which album has more bangin' choons?Another win for Leftfield. Quite aside from the barn-storming Release The Pressure, John Lydon's hell-raising rant on Open Up is the definition of \"bangin' tune\". Seriously. Grab a dictionary from your shelf. Look up the word \"bangin'\". Is the definition just a photograph of John Lydon trying to sell you butter? Told you so. Now look up the word \"moustache\". Is there a picture of a buffalo? If so, your dictionary is broken and you should ignore this entire paragraph.Winner: LeftfieldCriteria three: which album's track titles better remind me of cute animals?The tropical pretensions of Leftism count against Leftfield here: as everyone knows, you don't get cute animals in hot countries (don't google this). And while Remotion isn't overflowing with furry creatures, it does have Wild Horse, and a track called Le Soleil Et La Mer which I'm pretty sure is french for A Sealion And A Mouse. Again, don't google this. Also \"Global Communication\" is an anagram of \"clinical, numb moo-goat\", so there's that.Winner: Global CommunicationCriteria four: which of the two would Jesus listen to?I've just received this letter, postmarked 'heaven'. Let me just read it. \"Dear Fat Roland,\" it says, \"Jesus here. I object most strongly to your inclusion of Leftism in this blog series. I tried listening to this with my disciples and it was mostly enjoyable. It's got a good beat. However, the moment when that John Lydon fellow says 'bigger than God' was most offensive. Smite you. Yours sincerely, Jesus Christ.\" Oh dear. It looks like Remotion wins by default – but that's okay: it's an angelic-sounding album.Winner: Global CommunicationCriteria five: which is the better album to sing songs about eggs to?Global Communication had some good egg-singing opportunities. In Delta Phase, I found myself singing the phrase \"lovely eggs, I just want some lovely eggs,\" while on Epsilon Phase, it was possible to repeatedly sing the line \"Have to add some cheese, reaching to the knife, chopping all the thyy-yyme.\" However, there was much more on the Leftfield album, with eggy lyrics including \"I've got to stand and fry\" and \"You're original, with your own pan\" and \"You fried, you baked, you beated, you made some eggs\" and \"ovum up, make room for cheese\". Sp-egg-tactular.Winner: LeftfieldCriteria six: which album has the better cover design?The 'jawbone lens' design on the Leftfield album cover is beautifully done, and I remember buying my gatefold vinyl edition with pride. In a nice coincidence for this randomly-curated contest, Leftfield's cover designer Jonathan Cooke also did the artwork for the US release of a Chapterhouse remix album by Global Communication, which incidentally featured two tracks from Remotion. Unfortunately, the cover artwork of Remotion itself is a bit, er, Word Art. Leftfield wins this one.Winner: LeftfieldCriteria seven: miscellaneous and worryingly randomThis final set of criteria is guided by the wisdom of Wikipedia's random page button. Here goes. Which album is more Italian? Leftfield is a bit Afro, and Remotion has French track titles – the latter wins for being slightly closer to Italy. Which album smells fishy? Leftfield because of its Space Shanty. Which album is worse for your eyesight? The Leftfield album features a camera lens, so it must be Global Communication. Which album should be home to migratory birds? Global Communication because they can perch on the Wild Horse. Which album would be better at digging wells in south western India? Oh CHEERS for that, Wikipedia. Global is a deeper listen so, er, them.Winner: Global CommunicationOverall winner and going through to the quarter-finals: Taking the final place in the quarter-finals is Leftfield's Leftism. Goliath won over David, but it was a close call. Good job, really: I don't want to get beaten up by John Lydon.The next phase of this neverending battle will be the quarter-finals, which will feature (SPOILER if you haven't read all the blog posts so far): Freefloater by Higher Intelligence Agency versus Timeless by Goldie; Maxinquaye by Tricky versus Everything Is Wrong by Moby; Post by Bjork versus ...I Care Because You Do by Aphex Twin; Landcruising by Carl Craig versus Leftism by Leftfield.

{"title": "Best electronic music albums of 1995: The Black Dog versus Carl Craig", "date": "Mar 23, 2020", "text": "Three weeks ago, I began a battle to determine the best electronic music album of 1995. That battle is still going: this is heat seven of eight, after which we get to the quarter finals. See the series so far here, and see the 16 albums I started off with here. \"But Fats, this is going to take many more weeks if you keep posting this slowly.\" Considering the current climate, that is no bad thingI fired up my trusty random number generator to pick today's pairing. Remember, only one of these will survive through to the quarter-finals. The choice is between:Spanners by The Black DogLandcruising by Carl CraigThis is a fascinating match. In one corner, we have a seminal British IDM act clearly influenced by Detroit techno. And in the other corner is a bonafide Detroit techno album debut. Good job there is no chance of messing up this contest with comparisons that blabber on about biscuits and cute animals, huh.Criteria one: which album would make a better biscuit?The Carl Craig album would be a cookie rather than a biscuit. This is because Americans have funny words for things. They also call herbs 'erbs, pavements sidepavements and aluminium aluminiminimum. Spanners by The Black Dog is such a wonky take on recognisable techno, it would be an unusual biscuit like Mr Kipling Viennese Whirls or those pink wafery things. That said, Carl Craig wins because The Black Dog's techno biscuits would be so loaded with e-numbers, they'd make your eyes pop out of your bum-hole.Winner: Landcruising Criteria two: which album has more bangin' choons?I once praised The Black Dog's Barbola Work because it was \"one of the few classic 90s techno tracks that makes you cha-cha-cha\". It's easy forget now how alien and amazing their work was when it first appeared. Carl Craig's got the tunes, though: Einbahn is Autobahn on rollerskates, and the sheer 80s drama of Mind Of A Machine is enough to crack a smile on a bloodhound.Winner: LandcruisingCriteria three: which album's track titles better remind me of cute animals?Carl Craig's debut album falls down badly here. There are no animal references in his track titles. I'm not saying he hates animals so much that he sneaks around back alleys baseball-batting weasels to death: that is for you to decide. Looking at The Black Dog's titles, Pot Noddle is definitely the name of a crime-fighting pig and Nommo is its sworn warthog enemy determined on wreaking destruction all across the pig sty. Oh and they're both dressed in tutus, so they're still cute.Winner: SpannersCriteria four: which of the two would Jesus listen to?When the UK lockdown is over, pop into your local church. Who's the vicar? Oh look, it's Carl Craig. And the church organist? Carl Craig again. Who's that little old lady running the coffee bar? It's Carl Craig in a dress. Now pop to your nearest Buddhist centre. Look at all those little fat statues of Carl Craig! Saint Craig is so spiritually connected on Landcruising, he simply has to be Jesus's favourite. The Black Dog feels more like a crusty old geezer collecting sign-ups for a humanist society round the back of Aldi car park.Winner: LandcruisingCriteria five: which is the better album to sing songs about eggs to?It's not often I type this sentence, but neither album really screams eggs. The Black Dog album suggests Starburst sweets, odd-shaped leeks and an interesting purple mould that's taken hold at the back of the fridge. The Carl Craig album suggests oysters served on a lattice of spun caramel drizzled in the finest liqueur. What wins this category for The Black Dog is the chattery voice in transitional track Bolt1 which definitely sounds like someone yabbering on about Tesco's running out of eggs.Winner: SpannersCriteria six: which album has the better cover design?Landcruising is brilliant driving music, and its cover logo is clearly a nod to Detroit's automobile industry. The three-headed CGI beast on the cover of Spanners is more confusing. Is it a dog gone wrong? Is it a fancy paperweight? Is it a hallucination and I really should stay off the Windolene? Of the two, the strange black dog is the more memorable.Winner: SpannersCriteria seven: miscellaneous and worryingly randomThis final area of judgement takes as its cue Wikipedia's random page function. Here goes. Which album is the most moist? Detroit gets five inches more rainfall per year than Sheffield, so Craig has it. Which album will win you the lottery? The Black Dog because of the track Utopian Dream. Which album is a heavy assault tank? Carl Craig because he be landcruisin'. Which album is a novel nanomaterial? Carl Craig's album is a debut, so it's novel by default. Which album has stout, sparse tentacles like the white sand anemone? The Black Dog, obviously – dogs are famous for their tentacles. Three-two to Craig.Winner: LandcruisingOverall winner and going through to the quarter-finals: The Black Dog are so central to my love for electronic music, that I'm chalking this win as a surprise: it's Carl Craig's Landcruising that cruises (geddit?!?!?) through to the quarter-finals. Well deserved: it's a cracking album, despite the weasel thing.There is one heat left in this first round, so stay tuned: the battle to find the best electronic music album of 1995 will continue.

{"title": "Best electronic music albums of 1995: Aphex Twin versus Nightmares On Wax", "date": "Mar 19, 2020", "text": "Welcome back to the battle to become the best electronic music album of 1995 in which I play judge, jury, executioner and toilet attendant. This is the sixth of eight first-round contests (I won't spoilt the results, so see the series so far here). The winner goes through to the quarter finals. See the 16 albums I started off with here.The randomly chosen tie for today is:...I Care Because You Do by Aphex TwinSmokers Delight by Nightmares On WaxWe have the 13th best IDM album of all time (say Pitchfork) versus the 15th best trip-hop albums of all time (say Fact). Let's talc this pair up and throw them into the ring. Kamaete mattanashi! Let this bout begin.Criteria one: which album would make a better biscuit?Great question. If Smokers Delight was a biscuit, it would be something you'd get from Waitrose: it would be caramel flavoured or perhaps infused with fennel. I can't be more specific because the place scares me. I fled from a Waitrose once after seeing eighteen flavours of breadstick. The Aphex album feels more biscuity, even though it will never move beyond the levels of a custard cream or a jammy dodger.Winner: ...I Care Because YouCriteria two: which album has more bangin' choons?The Nightmares On Wax has an earworm so large, it looks like a giant dong: the descending strings of Nights Introlude have swirled around my head for 25 years, partly thanks to their reprisal on Les Nuits. That said, Aphex's follow-up to his Selected Ambient Works albums is a triumph of melody: the gentle steeliness of Alberto Balsalm, the waning flows of The Waxen Pith, the shimmery sadness of Start As You Mean To Go On, the off-kilter insistence of Wet Tip Hen Ax. Neither album especially bangs, but Mr Twin has the most choons.Winner: ...I Care Because YouCriteria three: which album's track titles better remind me of cute animals?This is another straight win for Aphex Twin. Imagine a messed-up Wombles in which the common is made of drugs and instead of picking up litter, they pick up unicorns. And all the Wombles are mauve and made of anti-matter. Yes? Let's introduce the characters. Here comes Ventolin on his skateboard made of rainbows. Running behind him is little Mookid, the Womble with the fifteen udders. Cow Gud Is A Twin is his twin. And there, shuffling behind them while brandishing his walking stick, is old Alberto Balsalm. Wombles of Wimbledon, techno are we.Winner: ...I Care Because YouCriteria four: which of the two would Jesus listen to?While Aphex Twin has spent much of his career looking a bit like Jesus, there is something undoubtedly spiritual about Nightmares On Wax. When you speak to NoW's George, you get the feeling he's trying to connect to a higher power – hence later album titles Mind Elevation and Shape The Future. He'd make a great cult leader. Maybe George is the Holy Spirit, while Aphex is Jesus. And Jesus definitely listens to the Holy Spirit. Does that make me God? Lawks. I hate wearing white.Winner: Smokers DelightCriteria five: which is the better album to sing songs about eggs to?A write-off. I tried some egg songs, but none of the lyrics could fit. There's a background vocal in Nightmares' Stars which could pass for \"eggs\" but I think they're saying \"hedge\". And hedges are not eggs: I know because I've tasted them. If my heart was an egg, Aphex and Wax have broken it, and they didn't even made a heart omelette or a heart cake out of it. Very dis-egg-pointing.Winner: No-oneCriteria six: which album has the better cover design?Smokers Delight's cover is a jumble of strange totems topped with graffiti-style text to symbolise the dualities of spirituality and urbanity contained within the album's music. Meanwhile, the cover of ...I Care Because You is Aphex Twin's big face. That's right. He drew his own face. Have you ever tried to draw your face? Half the time, I don't know where my face is. I've tried opening my eyes really big but it's still difficult to see my face. Sometimes I pass a mirror, and the mirror reminds me where my face is, but then I turn round to take a good look at my face and it's gone. How can you draw that? It's impossible, but Aphex Twin managed it.Winner: ...I Care Because YouCriteria seven: miscellaneous and worryingly randomAs if this project wasn't silly enough already, this final set of criteria is guided by the random article function on Wikipedia. Let's jumble up some pages and pick a winner. Which of the two albums is the most science fiction? Nightmares totally has his mind on otherworldly things. Which album would most protect you in a hailstorm? Aphex because he cares (because you do). Which album would be listened to by 19th century cartographer Émile-Fortuné-Stanislas-Joseph Petitot? Nightmares because his track titles reference Venice, Groove Street and a beach. Which album would get baptised with a two-edged sword? The dualities of Nightmares On Wax. Which album is a sanatorium? Aphex because Ventolin will make you better.Winner: Smokers DelightOverall winner and going through to the quarter-finals: A relatively easy victory. Aphex, Aphex, Aphex. Twin, Twin, Twin. You can chant that if you want.Stay tuned - two more albums will battle for the title of best electronic music album of 1995 as decided by me.

But I haven't had the time, so here we are dragging it kicking and screaming through March as if we've got nothing better to do. See the 16 albums I started off with here.As ever, I use a random number generator to pick each head-to-head. Remember, only one can survive through to the quarter-finals. This time, we have:Tri Repetae by AutechrePost by BjorkOh this is going to be horrible. Hey children! Which puppy do we throw into the mincer?Criteria one: which album would make a better biscuit?This is the album that signalled Autechre's descent into more complicated, awkward, spiky electronic music, so if it was a biscuit it would be the oaty kind that leaves bits in your teeth. With its filmic anthems and bold ballads, Bjork's second album is more showy: perhaps it would be a jaffa cake or one of those flavoured Penguins, but not something we'd traditionally think of as a biscuit.Winner: Tri RepetaeCriteria two: which album has more bangin' choons?I want to take Autechre's Clipper and tattoo the sound all over my naked body. I want to knit Clipper's rhythms into a scarf and strangle myself senseless with it. I want to shove Clipper up my bum and bounce on a space hopper until my intestines ping out of my eyes. That said, nothing says \"banging tune\" more than Army Of Me, Hyperballad, and, well, half the tracks on Post.Winner: PostCriteria three: which album's track titles better remind me of cute animals?I'm not sure the imaginary animals on Autechre's album are that cute. Clipper sounds like an angry dolphin, Stud is an amorous stallion trying to hump everything but the fence post, and Leterel is a sneaky eel that's just signed you up to a timeshare con without you noticing. Bjork's Isobel tells the story of a girl born in a forest, but to the uninitiated, the title sounds like something you'd call a warthog if you were trying to convince people it was cute. In a way, it's the antithesis of cute. Strangely, Autechre wins.Winner: Tri RepetaeCriteria four: which of the two would Jesus listen to?I have consulted the runes and they tell me both Bjork and Autechre have Godlike status. Both come from faraway lands (Iceland and Manchester), attracting fanatical followers as they spread their gospel of musical purity. But since Tri Repartae sounds like a sinister Catholic order that flays choirboys for fun, this one has so go to Autechre.Winner: Tri RepetaeCriteria five: which is the better album to sing songs about eggs to?As I sat on the bus improvising egg songs over these albums, one artist clearly won through. With Bjork, I managed to loudly sing \"it's oh so quail… you fall in l'oeuf…\" and \"my name's scrambled egg, married to my shell\" and \"if you complain once more, you'll meet an army of quiche\". I tried so hard to match egg words to Autechre, and as my fellow passengers wrestled me to the floor, I had to admit defeat. There's nothing eggy about Autechre.Winner: PostCriteria six: which album has the better cover design?Two drastically different covers. The Designer's Republic deliberately stripped the graphics for Tri Repetae's muddy monotone. The Post cover puts Bjork front and centre, contrasted against her hyper-coloured surroundings. Both covers are great. However, on the Post album, Bjork is dressed as an envelope. Never noticed that before? Have a look. Post. Envelope. Post. Envelope. Absolute genius.Winner: PostCriteria seven: miscellaneous and worryingly randomThis set of criteria is led by the random article page on Wikipedia, so strap in. Which album is the gayest? Queen Bjork, obviously. Which album would lead a navy? Bjork is feistier than Napoleon: she would lay waste to her enemies. Which album would succeed as a member of a Chinese rowing team? Autechre because there are two of them. Which album is the most legally disputed? Bjork because of Possibly, Maybe. Which album was born in an African tribe 3,000 years ago? Autechre because it sounds like it emanates from the very beginning of time.Winner: PostOverall winner and going through to the quarter-finals: This was a tough match, but it's Bjork that moves into the quarter-finals. I'll expect angry letters from Autechre fans. To be honest, though, would the Autechre chaps dress up as envelopes? I wouldn't have thought so.When I get time, two further albums will face off against each other in an attempt to become the best electronic music album of 1995 as decided by me.

{"title": "Best electronic music albums of 1995: Moby versus David Holmes", "date": "Mar 8, 2020", "text": "What's black and white and red all over? I have no idea, so why not ignore that sentence and instead read this continuing contest to find the best electronic music album of 1995. With today's post, we reach the halfway point of the opening knock-out rounds, with each winner going through to the quarter-finals. See the series so far here, and see the 16 albums I started off with here.I use a random number generator to pick each pairing. Today it is:Everything Is Wrong by MobyThis Film's Crap Let's Slash The Seats by David HolmesHere we have very different producers whose music has worked brilliantly in film and television: Moby in Heat, The Sopranos and Stranger Things, and David Holmes in a tonne of on-screen stuff including Ocean's Eleven and Killing Eve. But which one will stand up to my strict criteria? Let's find out.Criteria one: which album would make a better biscuit?The filmic flavour of Holmes' work is brilliantly suited to the rich history of biscuits and its many flavours: ginger, plain, chocolate, a bit more plain. As it tumbles from dirty beats into evocative samples, his debut album bridges the gap between his DJing career and his movie scores. And what is a biscuit other than a bridge between cake and bread? In contrast, Moby is the name of a fish and no biscuits taste of fish.Winner: This Film's Crap Let's Slash The SeatsCriteria two: which album has more bangin' choons?Holmes has a great ear for melody, and the album neatly loops back to the same hazy chords. But Moby's album has screaming rave tracks and angry thrash metal, with brilliant turns by Rozz Morehead for the fast stuff and Mimi Goese for the slow stuff. Bangin'? It's bulldozing down the doors while shooting foghorns out of a cannon.Winner: Everything Is WrongCriteria three: which album's track titles better remind me of cute animals?With track titles like When It's Cold I'd Like To Die, Moby's album isn't focused on cute animals. Many critters enjoy the cold, such as baby seals, baby penguins and all those baby spiders secretly hiding in your fridge. Holmes's track titles evoke a grizzly bear tearing through an orphanage, particularly with Got F***ed Up Along The Way and Slash The Seats. All in all, a disappointment for both albums. Moby scrapes a win because of the track name First Cool Hive: bumble bees are fuzzy.Winner: Everything Is WrongCriteria four: which of the two would Jesus listen to?The melancholic claustrophobia underpinning This Film's Crap feels more like purgatory than a heavenly place, despite the clanging church bell that ushers in the album. It's this uneasiness that made it such a remarkable work. On the other hand, Moby gives us rousing anthem after rousing anthem (\"take me away!\") that could easily be hollered from a pulpit. Everything Is Wrong is the sound of a coked-up church revival meeting. No wonder his early albums included the credit \"Thanks to Jesus Christ\".Winner: Everything Is WrongCriteria five: which is the better album to sing songs about eggs to?The best I could do with Holmes was \"she don't even yolk\" which isn't even a verb. Meanwhile, after the chorus in Feeling So Real, Moby has a sample that sounds like a truncated \"eee-ee-eeggs\". In other songs, I found myself singing \"every time you touch me, I feel like I'm being boiled\" and \"I am white albumen, poaching forever, I fry into the blue\" and on Bring Back My Happiness \"these hard eggs let you go\". So much fun. Another win for Moby.Winner: Everything Is WrongCriteria six: which album has the better cover design?An album called Everything Is Wrong and there's Moby looking depressed on the cover with a sad blue face? It's a bit on the nose. A metaphorical nose, that is, not Moby's nose. Stop thinking about Moby's nose. The montage that comprises the cover to David Holmes's album isn't particularly memorable: what do a few rips, a couple of hands and a big knife represent? Gordon Ramsay making whoopie? Yeesh. Don't think about that: think about Moby's nose instead. Holmes wins it because at least it looks like the cinematic layerings of his music.Winner: This Film's Crap Let's Slash The SeatsCriteria seven: miscellaneous and worryingly randomThis final selection of judging criteria comes to you courtesy of Wikipedia's random page function. Which album is most like a Bulgarian footballer? Holmes because he looks like he can dribble along a touch-line. Which album would make a great motto on a commemorative coin? In Brexit Britain, that would definitely be Everything Is Wrong. Which album should have represented Ireland in the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest? David Holmes is from Belfast, so he's the closest. Which album's hindwings are whitish with an orange subbasal fascia? Moby has the most orange and white on his album cover so, er, that. Which album is scaaaaandalous (said in a RuPaul voice)? The seat-slashing David Holmes, obviously.Winner: This Film's Crap Let's Slash The SeatsOverall winner and going through to the quarter-finals: This felt like a pretty easy win for Moby. Although he'll be mostly remembered for 1999's Play, selling 12 million units to Wrong's 250,000, it's nice to honour 90s raver Moby with this little success. Everything Is Wrong goes through to the quarter finals.Stay tuned for another head-to-head battle to find the best electronic music album of 1995 as decided by a jury of one: me.

Two more debut albums, and it looks like a pushover for Massive Attack's mate. But is it though? Read on.Criteria one: which album would make a better biscuit?Brian 'BT' Transeau's album is so shiny and smooth, if it was a biscuit it would be coated in chocolate or gold or creosote. Possibly edible, possibly not. The stories of Maxinquaye's chaotic recording sessions bring to mind meandering studio sessions, tapes full of unusable samples and floors littered with vinyl records. If that album doesn't resemble a box of broken biscuits, I don't know what does.Winner: MaxinquayeCriteria two: which album has more bangin' choons?Tricky's album was full of quotable quotes, albeit murmured and deeply smoked. However, BT's album was a landmark in progressive trance that melded the signature chunky house of Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto Records with diva-style singing. The 1996 edition's got Tori Amos on, for warbling's sake. You can't get more iconic than Broadway vocal coach Vincent Covello's turn on Loving You More, one of my most played 12-inches from back in the day. An easy success for BT.Winner: ImaCriteria three: which album's track titles better remind me of cute animals?Almost none of the track titles remind me of cute critters, so I can only assume BT and Tricky both hate animals. The BT album is full of aspirational titles like Embracing The Future and Deeper Sunshine. You try telling that to a rabbit: they just want to sniff lettuce and look at hay. Tricky's album doesn't fare much better: gothic titles like Suffocated Love and Black Steel poll quite badly with the baby otter community. Tricky saves the day with one solitary track title: Pumpkin is definitely in the top 100 hamster names. A winner by a (cute, snufflin') nose.Winner: MaxinquayeCriteria four: which of the two would Jesus listen to?Possibly the most memorable track on Tricky's album is Hell Is Round the Corner, which sounds like Jesus ranting to the Pharisees. But the BT album goes one better by portraying on its cover the underwater statue Christ Of The Abyss. Hey Jesus, which album do you prefer? \"The one with my picture on, obviously, you idiot.\" Good point. Thanks, Jesus. \"Bog off.\" Oh. Okay then.Winner: ImaCriteria five: which is the better album to sing songs about eggs to?A hard (boiled) win for BT here. Across various songs, I could fit the lyrics \"Egg? Hell yeah\" and \"I'm loving eggs more than I ever have before\" and \"these are my ee-eegs\". Maxinquaye confused my tastebuds and I ended up composing a three-hour mumblecore opera about Pot Noodles. I don't wish to libel the Trickster, but I don't think he has ever seen an egg in his entire life.Winner: ImaCriteria six: which album has the better cover design?The composition of the Ima cover is pleasing, with Wet Jesus embracing the sunlight in the centre of the design. But if you buy a different edition, the soggy saviour is sidelined in favour of a stock image of some clouds underneath a grey rectangle. Disappointing. The rusted and peeling panels of the Maxinquaye design is a stronger design, suggesting both decay and warmth, and if you staple-gun it to your Ikea wardrobe, people will think you own vintage furniture.Winner: MaxinquayeCriteria seven: miscellaneous and worryingly randomFinally, here is some assorted criteria generated with the help of Wikipedia's random article function. Which album has the highest fat content? Tricky doesn't sound healthy on Maxinquaye, so it has to be that one. Which album would most startle a moth? Ima because of the blinding light on its cover. Which album would win the US Open Cup Final. I don't even know what this is and I can't be bothered reading the Wikipedia article. Let's say Tricky, because he can team up with Massive Attack and win the football / golf / netball / yachting / whatever it is. Which album is conceptual art? Obviously Tricky because of the graffiti connection. Which album sounds most like I Pray On Christmas, Harry Connick Jr's 1993 Christmas carol? The one with Jesus on the cover, of course. Isn't that right, Jesus? \"Get lost.\" Oh.Winner: MaxinquayeOverall winner and going through to the quarter-finals: I said I thought this would be a walkover by Tricky. It was closer than expected because SOMEONE chose some ridiculous criteria with which to judge these albums, but it is indeed Tricky that goes through to the quarter-finals.In the next day or three, two further albums will battle it out to win the accolade of best electronic music album of 1995.

{"title": "Best electronic music albums of 1995: Goldie versus the Chemical Brothers", "date": "Mar 2, 2020", "text": "Here is the second round of my all-singing all-dancing contest to find the best electronic music album of 1995. See the series so far here, and see all 16 featured albums here.A random number generator tells me the next two contestants are:Timeless by GoldieExit Planet Dust by The Chemical BrothersLawks. Only one can get through to the quarter-finals. Fire up the chainsaws!Criteria one: which album would make a better biscuit?Here we have two critically acclaimed debut albums released within a month of each other in 1995, each one a shining example in its field. But which one goes better with a cup of Tetley's? The tone of these albums is wildly different: the Chemicals with their floor-stomping rafter-shaking beats, and Goldie with his complex rhythms and symphonic satellite sounds. Biscuits are basic: it has to be the block-rocking Brothers.Winner: Exit Planet DustCriteria two: which album has more bangin' choons?On one hand we have the \"brothers gonna work it out\" refrain alongside contributions from Beth Orton and the fringe guy from the Charlatans. On the other hand, we have the epic Inner City Life: feel your spine shiver with that opening \"tiiimeleeeeess\" from Urban Cookie Collective's Diane Charlemagne. Since these albums came out, we have endured terrorism, recessions, riots and fascism. Which tune echoes through the ages? Tiiimeleeeeess...Winner: TimelessCriteria three: which album's track titles better remind me of cute animals?I'm going to ignore the fact that Goldie was obviously named after a famous Blue Peter dog. Timeless's first disc ends with the track Jah The Seventh Seal, which means this album must contain six other seals. The Chemicals have the track Three Little Birdies Down Beats. So what's better: three little birdies or seven blubbery seals? The birdies have it.Winner: Exit Planet DustCriteria four: which of the two would Jesus listen to?Goldie's album starts with Saint Angel and ends with Jah, while his track This Is A Bad sounds like a precis of Jesus banging on about good trees bearing bad fruit. It certainly sounds heavenly with all its extended chords, while Exit Planet Dust has chemicals and swearing and a song to evil singing birdwomen the Sirens. No offence, Chemical Brothers, but you are definitely going to hell.Winner: TimelessCriteria five: which is the better album to sing songs about eggs to?A couple of moments on the Chemicals album proved successful. On Life Is Sweet, I managed to sing \"I'm boiling my eggs soft, but I forgot to set the timer\" and on Alive Alone I could fit the lyrics \"I'm an egg, aren't I, I'm an egg, oh no\". It's all pretty negative about eggs though. On the Goldie album, I not only could warble a chandelier-smashing \"tiiimeeeer\", I could also sing \"Om-el-ette, oh those yolken eggs is what I wanna eat, sprinkle cheeeese, I need to be, I need to be your oooeuuuuuf\". Speggtacular.Winner: TimelessCriteria six: which album has the better cover design?The Brothers chose a photograph of a 1970s hippy couple possibly walking home from a music festival. The soft-hued picture has been flipped, so a clearly American car is driving on the wrong side of the road. It's an Instagram photo 15 years before Instagram. The Goldie design is impressive, with the Metalheadz logo embedded into some kind of robotic cloaca, but it lacks the resonance of its rival.Winner: Exit Planet DustCriteria seven: miscellaneous and worryingly randomThis final section contains criteria guided by Wikipedia's random article button. The album most likely to defeat the eye of Sauron? The aggressive rolling beats of Goldie. The album best made into a cheesy motivational kitchen sign? The Chemicals and the text would be In Dust We Trust. The album best used as a life raft? The Chemicals because it would placate the Sirens. The album filled with the most gas? Obviously Goldie: the album is mostly air. Album most likely to be found in the National Helicopter Museum? With his graffiti lifestyle and gold teeth, Goldie would definitely own at least six of their helicopters.Winner: TimelessOverall winner and going through to the quarter-finals: I did not like two big hitters appearing so early on in this competition. By a whisker, Goldie's Timeless wins this leg of the contest. Congratulations, big dog. Massive apologies to the Chemical Brothers. I'm sure you're gonna work it out. I'm sure you're gonna work it out. I'm sure you're gonna work it out. I'm sure you're gonna work it out...Two more 1995 albums will go head-to-head in the next couple of days or so.

{"title": "Best electronic music albums of 1995: Sabres of Paradise versus Higher Intelligence Agency", "date": "Feb 29, 2020", "text": "This is round one of the battle to find the best electronic music album of 1995, as voted for by me and me alone. See all the riders and runners here.A random number generator has picked the first two contestants. They are:Sabresonic 2 by Sabres of ParadiseFreefloater by Higher Intelligence AgencyWinner gets through to the quarter-finals. Let's go to war!Criteria one: which album would make a better biscuit?Great question, Fats. This is a pretty easy one. There's much to admire in the icy filters of the Higher Intelligence Agency's second album, following their brilliant debut Colourform and an impressive showing in the Artificial Intelligence series. But it's not very biscuity. If it was a foodstuff, it would be sour sweets or sprinkles, or that dry ice crap posh restaurants cover tables with. Andrew Weatherall's Sabresonic 2 is so tribal and earthy, you'd almost certainly throw it into a biscuit mix.Winner: Sabresonic 2Criteria two: which album has more bangin' choons?Ah. We have a problem here. Higher Intelligence Agency were never really about the massive tunes: it was more a soundtrack to which you could wheelbarrow a load of drugs down your gullet. And although Sabres arguably have more tunes, this second album is really just a remix of debut album Sabresonic. So the tunes are mostly not original: in fact, it's barely an album at all and shouldn't be on this list. Sssshhh. Don't tell anyone. By definition, the other album has more tunes.Winner: Freefloater Criteria three: which album's track titles better remind me of cute animals?Let's look at Sabres first. \"Smokebelch\" sounds like a disgusting hippo that you regret inviting around for tea, while \"Inter-Lergen-Ten-ko\" could be the name of an alien animal from a distant moon. Now let's look at HIA. Oh my. It has \"Fleagle\" and \"Skank\" and \"Tortoise\" and \"Ting\" and \"Pinkgreen\" and \"Taz\". If that's not a hilarious Netflix special starring subversive woodland creatures, then I'll eat my squirrel-skin hat.Winner: Freefloater Criteria four: which of the two would Jesus listen to?In giving a motivational speech to his newly-appointed apostles, Jesus said: \"Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.\" An easy win for the Sabres there.Winner: Sabresonic 2Criteria five: which is the better album to sing songs about eggs to?On Sabres' Return Of Carter, I could only do \"eeeeeggs, eeeeeggs, eeeeeeeggs\", while on Edge 6 I could sing \"I like eggs, the special eggs\" in a really catchy way. I couldn't do much with Smokebelch II. All I could with HIA's Elapse was repeatedly sing \"benedict, benedict\", and as for the rest of the album, it was so squiggly, it just put me off eggs. I wonder if the ambient dub scene just wasn't that into eggs.Winner: Sabresonic 2Criteria six: which album has the better cover design?A hard win for Sabres Of Paradise. The guy's got a sword through his head! Ha ha ha ha! What a stupid idiot, getting a sword through his head! He was probably just sitting there making a belly-fluff model of the K-Pop band BTS and then suddenly – whoomph! There's a sword through his head! Ha ha ha ha ha! That said, it's virtually the same album cover as previous album Sabresonic, which means he's only pretending to have a sword through his head. Disqualified. HIA wins.Winner: Freefloater Criteria seven: miscellaneous and worryingly randomSome final criteria chosen with the help of Wikipedia's random article button. A better album for flipping pancakes to: HIA because it sounds so airy. A better album for waking up Ann Widdecombe in the middle of the night to: definitely Sabres. The album that sounds most like echoes from an abandoned Albanian TV station: HIA because it sounds like satellites. An album for spies: Higher Intelligence Agency, of course: the clues in the name. A better album for drowning out 'iMammy (Batteries Not Included)', which is the hilarious title of season two episode three of the award-winning sitcom Mrs Browns Boys: Sabres of Paradise all the way.Winner: Freefloater Overall winner and going through to the quarter-finals: Freefloater by Higher Intelligence Agency. Perhaps a surprise and also a shame considering the recent news about Sabres' Andy Weatherall, but perhaps if it had been the original Sabresonic album, it would have been a different result. HIA go through. Using the same criteria (apart from the miscellaneous choices), witness another first round contest in the next day or two. See all the riders and runners here.Further Fats: See the whole Best Albums Of 1995 series here."},

Robson & Jerome took over the charts, and Oasis had a beef with Blur. I bet none of them remember any of it.To revive everyone's interest in this most average of years, I'm going to launch a contest. I have chosen 16 electronic music albums from 1995, and they will face off against each other in a knockout competition so tense, your knuckles will fall off.

Because it's my own record collection, there will be some notable omissions. Despite what everyone says all the time, I'm not perfect: just DEAL with it, jeez.The 16 albums will be randomly matched on a one-on-one knockout basis with the weaker album being eliminated. 16 in the first round, then eight in the quarter-final, four in the semi-final, and eventually a grand final to choose a winner: the bestest best electronic music album of 1995.Who gets to vote?

{"title": "A tribute to Andrew Weatherall: imagine a cake, a simple cake", "date": "Feb 22, 2020", "text": "I've spent this week feeling like poo. Some kind of lurgy that has robbed me of all my energy. No brain space for blog posts or for creative projects or for functioning as a human being.In the midst of this week's funk, I heard some terrible news. Andrew Weatherall died. I hoped that my fever had got so bad, I was hallucinating worst case scenarios. Alas, no. We lost a giant of electronic music.There may be some readers of this website who are unaware of the pull of gravity Weatherall had over modern electronic music. I'm still not quite out of the fog of illness, so here are some unedited and slightly clumsy thoughts on how important I thought Andy was.Imagine a cake. A simple cake. Something with a sponge and a pleasant jam filling. Now imagine shoving all the pills into that cake. Paracetamol, ecstasy, uppers, downers, bum pills, dog pills, M&Ms and Skittles. Imagine the pills being inserted by one of those tennis ball machines with a spring-firing mechanism. That's what Weatherall did to music.He did this to Primal Scream. He did this to Saint Etienne (\"cool and deadly!\"). He did this to New Order and Leftfield and mother-chuffing Starsailor. He was a constant remixing presence in the early releases of the Chemical Brothers, James and the Happy Mondays. Pow! Pills! Pow! More pills!Except it was never about narcotics for me: my highest and happiest days clubbing were devoid of any alcohol or drugs. It was about the trippy rhythms and driving bass that added a fizz to anything he touched.That fizz is probably best summed up in his wonky party production of Primal Scream's Don't Fight It Feel It – a track that bursts with B52s-style jazz-hands energy while still getting away with farty shredded guitar, clowny sirens, genuine soul and the chunkiest Italo-piano lead of 1991. Just listen to it build and build...Without Andrew Weatherall, there would be no Fat Roland. He was a staple of Manchester club night Herbal Tea Party back in the 1990s: in fact he was probably their most-booked act. That night was my gateway into electronic music.And I have fond memories of seeing him at The Orbit in Leeds, a venue I once blogged that \"arguably spawned my Fat Roland career. I remember watching DJs Andrew Weatherall and Sven Väth with intense interest, hovering behind them like a stalker. As I left the club, I had a lucid moment when I decided, with a theatrical flourish, that yes the world needed my DJing skills. (It didn't, but I went into DJing anyway.)\"For some reason, the likes of the Guardian and NME have left that element of Weatherall's legacy out of their tribute pieces.From Shroom to Boy’s Own Productions to Sabres Of Paradise to his insistance that DJs shouldn't play anything beyond 122bpm, Andrew Weatherall's impact on my corner of electronic music cannot be underestimated.I really wish this was a fever dream."},
{"title": "New music: Caribou, Wajatta & Grimes", "date": "Feb 16, 2020", "text": "Sometimes people release albums. I can't stop them, no matter how hard I try. Seriously, I attempt to catch as many as I can before they reach the general public, oh, no, another album got through my homemade anti-album filter, dammit.Anyhoo, here are some new and upcoming February releases that got through my sausage net. I really should stop making nets out of sausages.Caribou – Suddenly (City Slang)It's a good job Caribou is Canadian producer Dan Snaith and not an actual caribou. If you let a caribou into a studio full of recording equipment, it would crap everywhere and snap all the knobs with its hooves. We can only assume Snaith doesn't do this, although I've never been in a studio with him so your guess is as good as mine.Caribou (not the animal) is back this month with another album of summery pop called Suddenly. Single You And I is really good: half melancholic grief song and half broken bass banger. Never Come Back has a similar shimmery vocal vibe to his classic Sun. It's all sounding very promising indeed.Wajatta – Don't Let Get You Down (Brainfeeder)Here comes the second album from loop-pedal peddler Reggie Watts and house master John Tejada. You'll know Reggie from his television appearances and pop-parodying beatboxing. Go on, have a delve on YouTube: you won't regret it.\"Wajatta\" is, by the way, a combination of their names and the j is pronounced as an h. In the same way that if I teamed up with Justin Bieber, we would become Jat Rober. Or Fatin Biebland. And the e would be pronounced as a q. Words are fun.Grimes – Miss Anthropocene (4AD) And that's what I think of the fifth album of bleepy tunes from the headline-grabbing popster Grimes.What? There appears to be some text missing from the above paragraph? Ah, that's because I typed the letters at the speed of light, in tribute to Grimes calling herself c (the symbol for the speed of light). You have to read it at the speed of light otherwise you won't be able to read it. Sorry about that.Further Fats: New music – Squarepusher, Dan Deacon & Phase Fatale (2020)"},

Or like The Beatles returning as a drum 'n' bass act. Or like Jive Bunny revealing that all the music was made by actual bunnies.Last month's Love Regenerator 1 EP hit a million streams in just three days. It was apologetically clubby, summoning the spirit of acid pioneers Phuture and so much more. We're talking fat pianos, liquid breaks, choppy vocal samples and filter-tweakin' squelchy goodness. All the best of the underground 1980s and 1990s.Like a worm with an embarrassing zit, acid house has remained defiantly underground. We've had Voodoo Ray, Josh Wink and S'Express, but all of this was a long time ago. Justin Bieber was still in Calvin Klein nappies when Higher State of Consciousness was released.So when the biggest DJ in the universe (probably) goes acid house, this is big news. It could mean the first mainstream exposure of acid house for 25 years. Imagine the BBC News at Six being presented by a Tamagotchi. THAT'S how much of a revival this is.In the words of A Guy Called Gerald's 1989 top 20 hit Voodoo Ray:\"Ooh-oo-hoo ah-ha ha yeahHe-hey-ya hey-yah ah-ha ooh hey-yah ah-ha ooh\"Exactly, Gezza. That's exactly how I feel.Calvin Harris has a second Love Regenerator EP arriving later this week. I'm not sure we can cope with this. It's like the earth being struck with two dinosaur-destroying meteors rather than one. The shockwave of this second EP will be so ground-shaking, no-one else will make any music for months.Harris has been previewing bits on his Instagram and I can declare that, in the parlance of modern youth, it is banging. Proper banging and no mistake, missus. I'm sorry if my street talk is alarming to you, but I am well cool.Unless Def Leppard return as a KLF tribute act, Calvin Harris going acid house remains the biggest music news of all time.Further Fats: I love acid and the acid loves me (2015)Further Fats: \"Acid house - it's not real music, is it\" said the idiot (2019)"},

{"title": "Fifteen questions for Fat Roland (contains raisins)", "date": "Feb 4, 2020", "text": "This blog post is about me. Which is why it's accompanied by a picture of me.There's a 30-question Facebook quiz doing the rounds, so for the sake of content, here are my answers. I should point out that I deleted half of the questions: they were so inane, they made me want to go to a wedding reception with Westlife. Here, readers, are 15 questions about me. 1. Who are you named after? Not a who. A what. I'm named after a Roland JP-8000 synthesiser. I am not named after the chubby lad from Grange Hill, although there are worse people I could be named after. I could be called Dan Widdecombe.2. Last time you cried? I cry at everything. Movie endings, children's choirs, wasps, anything. Jojo Rabbit had me in floods of tears. Seeing arbitrary insanity through a ten-year-old's eyes, in appropriately dis-tonal primary colours (comedy Hitler, rabbit blatherings, \"clones\"), made this a deeply moving and exhilarating film. Roberto Benigni meets Wes Anderson. Go see.3. Do you like your handwriting? Actually, I do. It's a bit cartoony. As a child, I refused to learn joined-up cursive as it made no sense to my bookworm brain. Books didn't do cursive, so I shouldn't either. I'd have good handwriting for cartoon strip speech bubbles.4. Would you do a bungee jump? Plop off. I'd hit the ground so hard, I'd come out in China.5. What is your favourite kind of cereal? When I do eat cereal, which isn't often, I plump for something with raisins. Got to love a raisin. It's one of those foodstuffs people really baulk at, but they're idiots. Smother me in raisins.6. What is the first thing you notice about someone? Tentacles.7. Rugby or football? Neither. Both sports remind me of the horror of school changing rooms, the bullying tackles designed to injure me for fun, the cold mud and rain. Also, each side should be given a ball to make everything easier.8. What are you listening to right now? Finally a question relevant to my website. I'm currently enjoying Mason Bee's debut album Play Flights. He's the bloke who makes nice guitar sounds and bleepy melodics in Plaid, so it's like someone's taken all the harmony from Plaid and tied a big beautiful bow on it.9. If you were a crayon, what colour would you be? I've kept this question in here to show how bad the deleted questions were.10. Favourite smell? Not this quiz, coz it stinks. It's all the cliche answers, I'm afraid. Cut grass, fresh bread, nice flowers, old books, kittens in blenders. Some people like the smell of babies or hair, which is weird. If you scratch this blog, it smells of warehouse raves.11. Colour of your hair? Brown. Not a particularly interesting brown. A general hair brown. The colour of a horse that's just eaten two jars of Marmite. Like I say, not an interesting brown.12. Scary movies or happy? I'll choose scary. Actually, I'm watching fewer scary films as I get older. Maybe the torrent of existential terror that is modern life has finally got under my skin. Boo! Was that scary? No? Okay, I'll choose happy.13. Last movie you watched? That Armando Iannucci film about David Copperfield. More gentle than I expected; more Cock & Bull Story than Death Of Stalin. Dev Patel is perfect casting. Made me want to fly kites.14. Favourite Holiday? Why is holiday capitalised? I don't really do holidays. If I wanted to lounge around doing nothing, I can do that at home. If I wanted to see interesting sights, I can use Google. If I wanted to sit by some water, I can find a puddle. Sigh. I'm happy, honest I am.15. Best acid house tune? Great question. For years, my go-to acid tune was Fish & Chips by Hardfloor. It was on a Harthouse CD and I played it to smithereens.

It centres around the famous Shibuya road crossing in Tokyo. You know the one. It's made from steamrollered zebras.In the video, fancy glasses make display adverts go all glitchy and strange. A bit like that Roddy Piper film with the sunglasses and the aliens, except without any sunglasses and without any aliens.The track is an absolute belter, and the whole visual experience feels widescreen and ultra-technological. Neon signs everywhere, sunburst bright. And best of all, Squarepusher's face, name and logo keep appearing.I tried recreating the video in my sleepy suburb. I didn't have sunglasses, so I just gaffer-taped my eyes and ran out into the street. It's very hard to write your name and logo on everything when you can't see a thing.

I like the fresh sheets of a newly-made week. It’s like a tiny New Year’s Day, and you can fill your pocket with baby resolutions. Amazing!There are legions of coffee drinkers who can't function until their second morning cuppa. I see them everywhere, gormlessly slurping, eyes drooping like Dali's clocks. They need that sweet fix of squid ink and creosote, or whatever it is they put in that Starbuck’s gloop. I don't drink coffee, so I look down on them with disgust, what with me being perfect with no bad habits at all. My natural caffeine kick is simply the new day itself. \"Lovely morning!\" I yell as I skip merrily past bed-haired commuters weeping into their Metro newspapers. I've never held a 'standard' office job where I input data by smashing a keyboard with my face until the clock strikes five. So I’ve never internalised that Monday-to-Friday routine. Yes, my past jobs of journalism and bookselling involved offices, but it's not the same. Dolly Parton wouldn’t recognise any “takin' and no givin'” in my 9–5, no ma’am.The buzzy feeling I get at the start of the week is the same sparkly energy I get from discovering new music. The thrill of something not experienced before, the thrum of possibilities. The reason why this blog exists. I am the exact opposite of YouTube comment drones who complain about there being no good music since 1982.All this might make me sound easily pleased, like a Mrs Brown's Boys fan or a dog. I am. I totally am. Is this annoying to a lot of people? Yes it is. It totally is.On the flip side, by Friday all of my tiny resolutions lie smashed on the floor as the weight of the week brings me to my knees, my freshly-made week sheets all stained with drizzles of disappointment.

{"title": "In praise of 808 State's Gorgeous (which is gorgeous)", "date": "Jan 25, 2020", "text": "Here is a theory.If a band calls their album Gorgeous, then everyone thinks it's gorgeous. Witness the scrabble at the record shop counter as dribbling music fans demand to feast on something gorgeous. \"Look at this gorgeous album!\" you scream at the haggard shop assistant. \"It's called Gorgeous!\"Here is how that plays out in practice.808 State calls their album Gorgeous. People are kinda fine with it, but are still wedded to previous album ex:el. Meanwhile, album tracks Sexy Synthesiser and the UB40-sampling One In Ten sound odd in the long-receding wake of novelty chart rave. Select magazine calls Gorgeous \"over-familiar\" and gives it three stars.I have to say, though: Gorgeous was MY album. It came out in 1993, a year in which I was absorbing all the techno like a big shape-throwing sponge. It was my musical 'coming of age' year. Synthesisers WERE sexy. Calling something gorgeous DID make it gorgeous. I even wore the album's t-shirt to ribbons.There is so much to commend about this album. The sun-soaked steel drums of Plan 9. The deep forest samba of Contrique. The hippy indie vocals on Europa being the most 1990s thing ever. The Loop Guru-style stomp of Southern Cross. And Colony being an out-and-out banger.Following up 1991's ex:el was tough. That album had Bjork and New Order's Bernard Sumner. While Ian MacCulloch's vocals on Gorgeous's Moses had a Sumner-esque waver to them, serving to remind you of the previous album, Moses was much more of an earworm than any vocal on ex:el.On ex:el, In Yer Face and Cubik landed with such a thump in the charts, their reverberations were felt for years. Gorgeous was softer somehow, more mature, and there was nothing that would obviously trouble the top ten. This was nice because it felt like my secret underground album: an eccentric collection of post-Balearic bangers (new)built especially for my CD player.Gorgeous is great, and I have an affection for this album that's probably tied into my 1993 musical awakening. But I reckon I'm right. It's underrated. It might not have sultry lift music or James Dean Bradfield, but it's full of phat sounds. With a ph. And when people talk about pH scales, they're talking about science. Gorgeous is scientifically great.I demand we reassess this album's status in the pantheon of techno history. Go up to that record counter. Feast on something gorgeous. Dribble all over the \"card machine broken\" signs and flyers for student club nights. Make sure the shop assistant knows you're serious. \"I want gorgeous,\" you chant. \"I want gorgeous. I WANT GORGEOUS.\" Recite this blog post as security bundle you onto the pavement outside.You want Gorgeous. Say it.

At the weekend, at Manchester's Hope Mill Theatre / Turn On Festival, I performed my first full fifteen minutes of new material since I began developing my Seven Inch show in 2017. And boy, it was hard work.\"You don't have to go to the effort of devising new material,\" said the organisers.\"No, I really have to,\" I said with a crazed look in my eyes.Blow me down with a feather duster, it went well. Wonderfully fun. I can't recreate the chaos through the medium of blog text, so here is a vague description of my performance: an LGBTQ quiz derailed by pre-recorded malfunctioning audio beyond-terrible celebrity impressions, two startled contestants I insisted on calling Doris throughout, a mystery box labelled \"this is a box\", and a surreal use of a cartoon God.It was a move away from my music themes of previous performances, but I still managed to get in references to Kylie Minogue, Sam Smith and, er, Skrillex. One of the comedic conceits was that I decided that each round should have its own theme tune, so I wrote a bunch especially for the performance.

You could spool them with a pencil or a finger or a sausage.You'd have thought cassettes would have been confined to the dustbin of history, like the black death, Vikings and knocker-uppers. Not so. We appear to be in the midst of a cassette resurgence. Sales are up a billion squillion percent or something.Big stars are pushing the revival, with the likes of Kylie Minogue and Justin Bieber going down the cassette route. It's a good way to get someone to listen to an album in its track-listed order, escaping the ubiquitous shuffle button.In fact, we're several years into a cassette sales boom. Kylie kicked things off in 2017 with her album Golden, which apparently included some annoying glitter. Just imagine it: the case pings open and your eyes get confettied to shreds. Way to add an unpleasant surprise, Kyles. Why don't you bake cakes with tigers in while you're at it. Cake tigers. Terrifying.The increases in tape sales are massive, but that's starting from infinitesimal numbers. 2019's cassette sales are still only a tenth of one percent of sales 30 years ago. Even this blog has had more views than the UK's annual tape sales. Anything can show huge growth when starting from a low base. I could show a 100% increase in noses, which sounds humongous, but that's only one extra nose.\"Oh look, there's Fat Roland. Is that an extra nose he's sporting?\"\"Meh. Last week he had an extra shoe. It's getting boring now.\"See? Not impressive. Still, seeing cassettes surviving fills me with a warm nostalgia all down my pants. My early music listening was from home taping, and the first dance album I became truly obsessed with (The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld) I bought on cassette with my own money and hammered to death on my clunky old Walkman.It's a surprisingly robust format. It was meant to be replaced by DAT, but that mostly stayed in the confines of professional studios. Big and small versions were made, with the small versions ending up in answermachines and dictaphones, but again the original format clung on. I've tried replacing my cassette-playing by having a band of giraffes herded into my living room to play cover versions of my favourite songs, but the cake tigers ripped them to shreds.

Here are three January 2020 releases worth your attention.Squarepusher – Be Up A Hello (Warp Records)In recent years, Squarepusher has,in the parlance of modern slang, \"gone off on one\". His Shobaleader One project turned him into a kind of bezerker Cylon. He jammed with Japanese robots and produced an ambient soundtrack with Olivia Colman, which sounds like the kind of nonsense I'd make up, but it's true.This was all brilliant, but now ole Squiggleplops is back to more familiar territory with a studio album that follows up 2015's Damogen Furies. He's moved away from the extreme digitalism of his recent work, and has instead opted to use a bunch of old gear. I wonder how old. Maybe we're talking lutes and harpsichords and the jangle of jester bells.Actually, I've had Be Up A Hello on repeat for a few weeks now. I would give you my opinion, but my lips are contractually sealed. For now.Dan Deacon – Mystic Familiar (Domino Records) Speaking of following up 2015 albums, it's nice to see the return of Dan Deacon, eccentric knob-twiddler and Sigur Ros collaborator. A long time ago, I boldly - and prematurely - declared that Dan Deacon had the best album of the year. In that blog post, I bang on about his similarity to Animal Collective, and that's a comparison that I suspect will hold up on Mystic Familiar.With this album, he seems to be obsessed with \"familiars\" which are magical creatures that follow you around. That could include rats or cats or badgers or five-legged elephants or hedgehogs made of toenails or a panda reading a Thomas Pynchon novel.If Dan Deacon was a season, he'd be summer, or maybe a late spring that feels like a summer. Which leads me on to...Phase Fatale – Scanning Backwards (Ostgut Ton)Never mind all that summer nonsense. Scanning Backwards is beyond the four seasons: this is post-nuclear fallout when the skies shimmer with unearthly light. This second album of pumping Berghain techno from Berlin's Phase Fatale will please those of you that want aerobic techno shuddering with mantle-deep bass rhythms.He's promised \"brain-penetrating instrumentation\", which means when you tear the cellophane off the vinyl, a bassoon leaps onto your face and jabs your forehead with a whisk.Here are bits of two of the above albums.

{"title": "Best electronic albums of 2019: one", "date": "Dec 31, 2019", "text": "1 – Plaid – Polymer (Warp Records)I've plopped on about Plaid on this website many times in the past. They're no stranger to this end-of-year listing, appearing at number three in 2011, at number six in 2014 and at number two in 2016. In 2019, they finally take the title of Best Electronic Music Album of the Year. Congratulations, boys, you did it. You can finally retire. Pipe and slippers.Polymer is modern Plaid's masterpiece. In recent years, they've tended towards the pastoral, but now they've descended into a valley of darkness. They've scuffed their shiny bits, sandpapered their synths, creosoted their balls and given melody a good old duffing up. It's spiky enough to deter casual listeners, but if you don't mind a few scrapes during repeated listens, it's their most rewarding album for many years.As the synthetic hairiness of their album artwork suggests, this work is a true polymer: part organic and part android. Los squeaks and snarls as if snapping at the bars of cage and yet it's bedded by the blinking lights of robotic synth patter. The disembodied vowels of Ops spill from some unknown belly but when the track soars, its chimes skitter with clockwork regularity. The detailed patter of the beautiful Dancers is both flesh and machine in extremis.Each track has its 'thing', as each tangled motif stretches its shoulders. Drowned Sea gets so het up, at the three-quarter mark it collapses into sparkles. All To Get To Her quickly locks into a classic looping Plaid pattern. The shuffly Nurula revives The Bee's nifty guitar-work from The Digging Remedy. And Dust is their version of a lullaby despite ubiquitous synth blaps constantly threatening to bite off your hand.So many times during Polymer, I find myself holding my breath as the band raise Hitchockian levels of tension, and they know exactly when to press the release valve. Only on the percussive attack of Recall does there seem to be no hope, but even that track melts into ambience after two minutes, which makes sense in the context of the album's softer second half. It all fits.Best of all, this is a Plaid album that feels angry, raising their complicated post-IDM noodlings to the heights of justified emotion, and in turn adding even more heart to the more traditional Plaid melodics. I don't need to tell you the reasons to feel furious in 2019, but I'm glad this album was here for some psychosynthetic succour.Thanks for reading this mega list, and for reading my blog in 2019. Fifteen years and counting! Scroll the full best-of-2019 list here.2 – Pelada – Movimiento Para Cambio (Pan)Let's listen to the opening track together. There's the thump-thump of a bass drum. It's joined by a stuttering synth. Here come some finger snaps, but wait, something's happening. Are they speaking Spanish? Yes, I think it's Spanish. They're not stopping for breath. The beat drops. They start yelling. Oh my crap, the voice.This is Pelada.There is no album in 2019 that has side-swiped me more than Movimiento Para Cambio, which means \"movement for change\". Politics runs through Pelada's veins, as any lazy google-translating of their lyrics will attest to. Proper slacktivist, me.It's also musically a rich experience. I love the snap of Habla Tu Verdad, the soft melt of Granadilla and the glorious stadium techno reverb of Aquí.  I flipping love everything. It's Canadian Chicago house in Spanish, via New York punk and 1990s dance music.Put the production and politics together and you get this strange Robin S-tinction Rebellion pairing. And what a pair. The fierce vocals of Chris Vargas are alarming and may send some running for the hills, but their arresting energy constantly delights. Producer Tobias Rochman clearly bathes daily in dance music history: the album has the same try-it-and-see bedroom production vibe that made, for example, Bjork’s Debut so charming.Now let's stop listening to the opening track together. Why are you even sat on my lap? Weirdo.Movimiento Para Cambio by PeladaScroll the full best-of-2019 list here.3 – Loraine James – For You And I (Hyperdub)For You And I is the sound of London bustle, of coming out of basement clubs, of tube stations shuttering their doors, of a queer life in a contemporary capital. Apparently. I don't live in London. In Manchester, we don't go on tubes, we just swagger with our maracas.This freewheeling collage of broken bass music gets more compelling with every listen. The drum sounds are as loose as a bag of nuts: cheese-grated cymbals and strangled toms collide with precarious snares that rattle the walls of the album.It's like being parachuted into a leftfield techno metropolis without a map, but that's not to say there aren't familiar touchpoints as we hear Loraine's story. Scraping My Feet has some serious Aphexian melancholy. There's something Autechresque about the scrunched rhythms of So Scared. And London Ting is pure grime bravado – \"look at my skin!\" – told through a tough techno lens.All this on a debut album. Remarkable. As broad as London itself, it's one moment brutal, the next moment tender, all of it uneasy, all of it compelling. A boundary-breaking statement that's queer by nature and queer by noise. *shakes maracas*For You and I by Loraine JamesScroll the full best-of-2019 list here.4 – Chemical Brothers – No Geography (Virgin EMI) Of course No Geography's in my top five. Of course! It's the best Chemical Brothers album for ages. It's full of pow-pow and chug-chug and build-build and wooh-wooh and slam-slam and Tian Tian. Actually, that last one might be a panda. You get the idea, though.It's moment after moment of sheer clubbing energy. The robo-electro of Free Yourself! The power-snare roll on Gravity Drops! The old block-rockin' Chemicals showing themselves on the acidic We've Got To Try! Don your gold pants and get on that dancefloor and/or coffee table.The album is accompanied by a spectacular live show which has Tom and Ed at their career best. MAH's Network-style rant of \"I ain't gonna take it no more!\" is all the more powerful because I can picture the big arm-wavy guy from the show. But you don't need the visuals: just on its own, for example, the \"you and me\" speech on title track No Geography rattled my heart strings.There are no big guest vocalists: just the pow-pow and the build-build. It's pure uncut Chemicals. See what I did there? That's a drugs reference. Not that I know: the most I can manage these days is an extra spoonful of hot choc in my Highlights. If I know anything, it's how to make my drinks claggy.Scroll the full best-of-2019 list here.For the last time in this best albums countdown, let's park the rollercoaster for a moment and smell the candyfloss. Here's a longlist of music heavyweights who failed to make the final cut: they're totally good and brilliant, but I kicked them to the kerb like a sassy Simon Cowell.First up in this best-of-the-rest is Kornél Kovács and the thoroughly likeable Stockholm Marathon (Studio Barnhus). What starts as sugar-sweet vocal pop becomes a sun-glazed soup of instrumental  earworm after instrumentalearworm. Not that I'd drink a soup filled with worm ears. It sounds disgusting.Jacques Greene got his epic on for Dawn Chorus (LuckyMe), which balanced the bright boldness of Jamie Xx and the scuzzed darkness of Clark. Jenny Hval dived into some sparkly electronics on The Practice Of Love (Sacred Bones Records), a seventh studio album fired off while writing a novel – hashtag multitasking. And Signals Into Space (Les Disques du Crépuscule) was the soft-focus return of Ultramarine, techno's answer to Channel 4's Watercolour Challenge.The ever-filmic Amon Tobin was in an ambient mood on the intricate Fear In A Handful of Dust (Nomark). Flying Lotus was as generous and as overwhelming as ever on Flamagra (Warp Records), a work pepped up with a strange appearance by David Lynch. And although I thought Modeselektor's Who Else (Monkeytown Records) was a mixed affair, there was enough fried gold to make this longlist.And finally here are some giants of electronic music who I've consumed in small portions in 2019, but haven't absorbed enough to include in my final list. Because I can't knowingly give full recommendations, I shall describe each album with a meaningless simile. James Blake's Assume Form (Universal Music) was like a hot toaster on a day trip to a dog-strewn beach. Hot Chip's A Bath Full of Ecstasy (Domino) was like a hovercraft balancing atop the concept of green. And finally, Metronomy's catchy Metronomy Forever (Because Music) was like a metronome catching the metro with a, er, gnome, um, er, jeez, this is worse than the fruit puns. *destroys computer with chainsaw*Stockholm Marathon by Kornél KovácsDawn Chorus by Jacques GreeneScroll the full best-of-2019 list here.5 – Special Request - Vortex (Houndstooth)In 2019, Special Request released a billion albums. He fired them at our faces like a tennis ball cannon. There were albums everywhere: on the floor, down our trousers, down the back of the sofa, down the plug hole. Someone get me a plunger: SR's fired out another one.In October, he released the galactic r'n'b of Offworld, and a stonker it was too. In June, he gave us the brilliant Bedroom Tapes, taken from old cassettes he found in a house move. But since I'm only allowing him one album, it's May's storming Vortex that makes the list.Vortex is a speed-fuelled hymn to BPM: the breakbeats trip over each other to see who can get to the finish line fastest. You think things are hectic, but then tracks like Fett and (deep breath) A Gargantuan Melting Face Floating Effortlessly Through The Stratosphere join the speedway and kick everything else to the hard shoulder.There's a line to be drawn from peak smash 'n' grab 1990s Prodigy to Special Request's wonderfully futuristic visions. Vortex will leave you gasping — but don't gasp too much or he'll fire another album at your gob.(While this blog post was hovering in my drafts, Special Request dropped the fourth of his promised 2019 albums. Too late for consideration here, but click here to have a listen: the title perfectly summarises his balls-out attitude to music production this year.)VORTEX by Special RequestScroll the full best-of-2019 list here.6 – Nathan Macay – Blue Spring (LuckyMe)In this Picky B*stards piece, I refer to Nathan Micay as a \"weightlifting producer who chugs protein shakes during DJ sets.\" I joined a gym for a year once. The place was sweaty and full of posers and I never want to go there again.However, if Nath had a gym, I'd definitely go. He's already won the gold-plated accolade of album of the year on this very website under his Bwana alias. Can you imagine how many treadmill miles you'd clock up with his quality beats pouring from the speakers?Blue Spring threw me at first. It's no Bwana mark two, despite him still being in thrall to the amazing manga artist Katsuhiro Otomo. There's only one full-on house track here (The Party We Could Have): everything else is dialled back to feel introspective and cautious.What elevates this many levels above being nice-enough rainforest electro is simply how darn good the ideas are: the swagger of Moon Scepter Elimination, the wide-eyed voices of He Has The Key, the synthy drama of Blue Spring. You'll go back to it again and again. Most unlike a sweaty gym.Blue Spring by Nathan MicayScroll the full best-of-2019 list here.7 – Octo Octa – Resonant Body (T4t Luv Nrg)Resonant Body takes us on a trans journey, which is a bit like a bus journey only there are loads of Twitter warriors running alongside trying to cancel out your existence. It's tough enough coming out as trans, even tougher to produce an album this good.Here we have a party album bursting with breakbeats, acidic lines, sloshy snares, buoyant bass and choppy synths. It has depth too, such as in the plunging junglism of Ecstatic Beat and the misty ambient ripples of My Body Is Powerful.There's even a bit that reminded me of Orbital. I can't remember which bit. That's good, isn't it. Quality music journalism. I've basically just told you there's a bit that sounds like something somewhere on the album. Nice and specific.The climax of 'Body (as it's known to its friends) is almost bizarre as the final track is overtaken by an awkward crowd chant, but it feels deserved: Octo Octa's brilliant album isn't just a celebration of the body, but of a community. An unqualified joy: probably the most celebratory thing in this top 20.Resonant Body by Octo OctaScroll the full best-of-2019 list here."},

The guy from Kiasmos, the band that had the best album of the decade. No, you're confusing him with the drummer from Genesis. No, that's Frank the window cleaner from number 42. Oh never mind.Janus 'Kiasmos' Rasmussen's first solo album Vín is incredibly pretty. It's as pretty as a nice vase that has a really pretty design on it. I'm not good at describing vases. The melodies are simply layered, the beats driving: it's an attractive journey from A to B.What lifts it is the IDM warmth to the drums and the dual sensibility of classical and club that made Kiasmos so compelling. Here, the energy is almost euro-beat; sequences in primary colours that feel made for a truly international audience. And it's delicately dynamic: listen to the way the summery eight-bar melodic loop of Lilla splits into layers as the track progresses.A fine-sounding work. Unlike Frank the window cleaner who looks the offspring of a bin lorry that's mated with the scraggy dog that hangs outside the launderette. At least trim your forehead hair, Frank.Vín by Janus RasmussenScroll the full best-of-2019 list here.As my top ten favourite 2109 electronic music albums thunder across the internet like a pack of cows chasing an ice cream van, let's take a look at some ambient, classical-ish and pastoral albums that didn't quite make my final list.Leading this longlist is A Winged Victory for the Sullen: the elegiac ambience of The Undivided Five (Ninja Tune) constantly reached for a perfect fifth chord: extra points for a track-title dig at Jacob Rees-Mogg. I liked what previous Fat Roland champion Clark was doing on his television theme album Kiri Variations (Throttle Records) – all a bit fancy. This year saw the joyous return of Telefon Tel Aviv with Dreams Are Not Enough (Ghostly International). Its track titles were to be read as a poem, but the true meaning came from the ever-expansive production design.Also in my best-of-the-rest is Nils Frahm's All Melody (Erased Tapes), whose seventh studio album was classic Frahm with added trumpet. Parp! Tim Hecker gave us the rather coy Anoyo (Kranky), a brief ambient sojourn in which he was inspired, not for the first time, by Japanese gagaku music. And Nine Inch Nails keyboardist Allesandro Cortini picked up a guitar for the first time in his solo career and drowned it with spine-tingling analogue fuzziness on Volume Massimo (Mute).The ever-reliable Bibio went back to bucolic on Ribbons (Warp), with strings so lovely I'd wear them as a vest. The fact that Panda Bear guests on Teebs' lush Anicca (Brainfeeder) tells you exactly what that album sounds like: dreamy and exquisite. And the delicate glitches of Leif's Loom Dream (Whities) made me feel like I was getting razzed on fazoomy on a glacier's edge. Whatever the heck that means.The Undivided Five by A Winged Victory for the SullenKiri Variations by Clark9 – Caterina Barbieri – Ecstatic Computation (Editions Mego)Aargh. Aaaargh. Yaaaaargh. This is the sound of my brain being melted by the gamma rays created by the extraordinary mathematical synthesis from the latest album by former classical guitar student Caterina Barbieri. Aaaargh, Yikes. Oof!I normally like my music with a big fat beat, in the same way I can't eat lasagne without a load of Maltesers being thrown in. But like fellow Italian Lorenzo Senni, Barbieri has chucked the beats in the bin, and it's up to the restricted palette of synthesisers to do the work.Don't get me wrong. Ecstatic Computation is no meandering slouch or Steve Reich tribute. On Fantas, the synths spit and quiver. Closest Approach To Your Orbit is a whirlwind of spiralling melody. The portentous Pinnacles Of You sounds like every cathedral in Italy singing on the breeze. It's as dynamic as heck.I'd like to make something clear. That bit about the gamma rays? My brain is fine. I'm perfectly restaurant compos mentis. There is nothing wrong supermarket with my cognitive abilities trouser. Waffle spaniel historian clumps.

Three bands that made their television debut at Granada Studios. And which of those three would you like to see again on television? What? No, the answer's 808 State, you toss-brain.The Balearic boys are back, and everything sounds like they're in a decaying television production room, with crackly monitors, computers fizzing in the dust, endless corridors of wires that may or may not lead somewhere. Transmission Suite is, above all, a mood piece.There's a cold war level of paranoia too. Just who is that Japanese radio voice addressing on Tokyo Tokyo? Why is the American guy so regretful on the the loping Cannonball Waltz? Are those congas closing in on us during Ujala? Yargles.There's still time for the classic 808 State sound in the cheery lift music of Skylon and the careening rave chords of Trinity. But considering their 17-year hiatus, and a theme that harks back to the days of Tony Wilson on telly, Graham and Andy have produced a fantastically forward-thinking album.Transmission Suite by 808 StateScroll the full best-of-2019 list here."},

A boy-racer car pulled up: its rear window rolled down. A drug-skinny tough lad called me over. I'm dead, I thought. Or they're going to use me as a cocaine mule and stick things up my bum.\"Here mate,\" he said. \"You look like Johnny Vegas.\" And they drove off cheering. This, my dear readers, is urban Manchester, raw in tooth and claw. Track-suited lads making comedy comparisons to bewildered strangers. Brutal.Alright, perhaps this debut long-player from Manchester brothers Response & Pliskin is the true sound of urban Manchester: tense jungle, nosebleed rave, bassbin-blasting hardcore with titles declaring unrest: Abandoned, Persecution, Resist.Primarily consisting of epic rollers around – and beyond – the ten-minute mark, We're All Disturbed is one of the boldest albums I've heard in 2019, and if I hadn't discovered it so late in the year, it would no doubt be further up my list. And by the way, that lad totally looked like an emaciated Al Murray.We're All Disturbed by Response & PliskinScroll the full best-of-2019 list here.12 – Pye Corner Audio – Hollow Earth (Ghost Box)This bundle of vintage synth twiddling sounds like the soundtrack of a 1970s science fiction TV drama that's not yet been written. I'd star in it, of course. I'd be, er, Chief Roland Alien Policeman and I'd be in charge of policing aliens.I'd get to wear a police hat, of course. Hollow Earth deserves its own police hat. There's something distinctively Tomorrow's World and Radiophonic Workshop in the wavering chords and pillow-soft production. Here, have a hat, you excellent album.It's like a big hug. The way the analogue arpeggio meets a barely-present choir on title track Hollow Earth. The way the bass pulses in the tantalisingly dramatic Mindshaft. The way the album later breaks down into cotton wool ambience.Yes, I'd totally be brilliant at acting in the science fiction television show that doesn't exist but probably should because Hollow Earth is a cracking listen from start to finish.

Here are more best-of-the-rest albums that didn't make the top 20 best albums of 2019 — and this time, we're going underground: pounding techno and dubby grime.Dolenz's brutal and brilliant Lingua Franca (Exit Records) conjured up an imaginary sci-fi movie soundtrack expressed through nasty beats and buzzing bass. East Man switched to his Basic Rhythm moniker with some grime-gloamed frowning rhythms (try saying that six times fast) with On The Threshold (Planet Mu). On Ossia's debut album Devil's Dance (Blackest Ever Black), the dubby ambience was as much about the bass as the space around the bass.MC Yallah's all-dominating delivery was easily matched by the tough beats of Debmaster on Kubali (Hakuna Kulala). Meanwhile, DJ Nigga Fox got positively techno tribal on Cartas Na Manga (Príncipe) and Ilian Tape stalwart Stenny included some killer club cuts on Upsurge (Ilian Tape) – listen to this if you like Skee Mask.Beats not pounding enough for you? There were some big stompers on Ellen Allien's no-nonsense Alientronic (BPitch Control), while Nkisi's 7 Directions (UIQ) was all about the percussive Detroitian techno, and I'm still wonderfully haunted by the detached robotic vocals on PTU's Am I Who I Am (Trip).Finally for this little section, there's Blanck Mass's Animated Violence Mild (Sacred Bones Records), an artist who won my number one prize back in 2015. Although a bit more on-the-nose than previous iterations, this album was perfect for blowing some cobwebs from your brain. And from your chest. And from the inner regions of your spleen.

Recently he's been hanging out with Hudson Mohawke at HudMo's swanky LA residence. Somewhere inbetween comes this, his glorious third album.The reviewers have waffled a lot about light when writing about Ways Of Seeing, and they're spot on. Its like Konx has opened all the windows and sun-bleached his murky sounds. The darkness is still there (the sudden declaration of \"overdose!\" on LA Melody), but these are shadows in daylight rather than shimmers in the night.The album's also informed by Konx (his real name is Tom) moving to Berlin, and there's something notably European about the smooth flow of Nightwave collaboration I'm For Real. He also spent some time in Clark's studio, and I think some of the giddy looseness of the production could be testament to that.This has proper cheered me up, sitting here in my Manchester living room with all this LA-inflected beatsmithery drumming into my ears.

The knowing nod to a certain 2000 Warp Records EP is quite deliberate: Severance is Boards of Canada on uppers.The melodic leanings towards Drexciya, Detroit and the aforementioned Dayvan Cowboys seem simplistic on the first couple of listens, but this is an album I returned to again and again throughout 2019. It's addictive, like crack or caffeine or Windolene.With those past references in mind, I was a bit worried about including this in my top 20 because there is so much 1990s nostalgia on this website. But then there's the bounciness of Ghost Node, the boldness of NynIV, the (literal) breathiness of Lyre. This is a fine-sounding piece of work.I must apologise, by the way, for the constant comparisons to Boards Of Canada when covering this album. It's not fair. People often compare me to Johnny Vegas. You play the cards you're dealt, I guess. Monkey.Severance by MikronScroll the full best-of-2019 list here.15 – Karenn – Grapefruit Regret (Voam)There's a fruity feel to this debut album by Karenn, the techno pear – er, sorry, I mean pair comprising Pariah and Radiohead remixer Blawan. Track titles include Lemon Dribble, Strawbs and Kumquat: put this lot in a cake and you'll win Bake-Off for the next 52 years.I'm not a big fruit person, myself. So will this man go (mango) for it? Will me long (melon) for it? Is it as good as Buri(Berry)al? Hey, stop judging me. I've got a lot to write for this top 20 and I really haven't got time to come up with fruit puns that work. Wind your neck in, ta (nectarine).If Grapefruit Regret was indeed fruity, this would be the hard stone rather than soft flesh. It opens with metallic hydraulics leading into grubby speedway techno, all covered in industrial rust while the bass drum reigns supreme. No-nonsense pile-driving techno.The highlight is the hyper-charged warehouse stomp of Crush The Mushrooms, but there is a lot to admire in all of these spiky bangers. No compromise: a couple of men daring (mandarin) to do their own thing kumquat (come what) may. I am so sorry.Grapefruit Regret by KarennScroll the full best-of-2019 list here.16 – Floating Points – Crush (Ninja Tune)Apparently this new album by Mr Points (as his friends like to call him) arose from his improvisational sessions on tour with The Xx, armed only with a Buchla synthesizer, a Korg drum machine and a potted plant called Kenneth. On second thoughts, I may have dreamt the potted plant thing.Crush is a corking album packed with micro-shuffles and the kind of yearning synths you'd want at your bedside in the darkest moments of your life. Listen to the filtered electronic cries of Anasickmodular before the whole thing descends into fractured chaos. Lovely.The track Environments is a great example of Floaty (as his friends like to call him) at his best. It sounds so dang scratchy, your ears are likely to come out in boils. But he somehow pulls things back and launches into the bizarrest mini-siren rave crescendo.This is only his second album, and it's a tough call to follow-up such an acclaimed debut in the shape of 2015's Elaenia. But Flo-Pee (as his friends like to call him) has done good: a skitterish triumph. Look at little Kenneth's leaves shaking — he loves it too. Bless.Crush by Floating PointsScroll the full best-of-2019 list here.My top 20 list of the best electronic music albums of 2019 is well underway. But let's have a quick fag break and consider some albums that didn't make the final cut: my continuing longlist of the best-of-the-rest.The press blurb for Jodey Kendrick's EDM Vol.2 (Dub Recordings) suggests listening to this album is good for your brain development. All I know is I loved this squiggly Rephlexian IDM. Meanwhile, Antwood based the stonkingly spangly narrative album Delphi (Planet Mu) around a fictional lovelorn girl who comes complete with her own theme tune. And while we're on Planet Mu, Rian Treanor diced club music to pieces on the choppy ATAXIA (Planet Mu), and it sounded like someone attacking a computer with a hole-punch. In a good way.Lisbon's Photonz added a queer Balearic flavour to house music in the strong debut album Nuit (Dark Entries). New York label owner Anthony Naples impressed with expensive house on Fog FM (ANS) while Bristol producer Shanti Celeste evoked the spirit of dub techno on Tangerine (Peach Discs): brisk house cuts meet blunted ambience.Ooo, I must mention WH Lung whose wonderful and psychedelic Incidental Music (Melodic) evoked early Verve when Verve were just Verve without the \"The\". Aleksi Perala's Sunshine 3 (Dub Recordings) was so bright and cosmic, you could feel the stars twinkling in appreciation.And two final mentions for this slightly genre-ambivalent section. The titanic techno twiddler Bogdan Raczynski returned to us with Rave 'Till You Cry (Disciples), which was as fun and as daft as I had hoped. And I hold a special place in my heart for the unique Lee \"Scratch\" Perry. Adrian Sherwood brought out the best in ole scratchy on Rainford (On-U Sound).Delphi by AntwoodScroll the full best-of-2019 list here.17 – Barker – Utility (Ostgut Ton)I once went to a Leisure System night at Glasgow's ill-fated Art School and a pilled-up Glaswegian shouted at me and my mate for what seemed like 92 minutes. We didn't catch a word amid the thick accent and pumping beats, bar the phrase \"do you like heavy metal\".So Leisure System's great. Its co-founder Sam Barker held off releasing anything for ages, but finally he's plopped out an album. And not for the last time in this top 20 (expect this to become a theme), it's not the club stormer you'd expect.On Utility, the drums are hardly noticeable, and instead it's down to Barker's exacting synthesis to prove the rhythms. This is a slow album. It's not so much music you dance to, rather it's the echo of the music still ringing in your ears as you leave the dancefloor to go for a widdle.Stop a moment and let the descending shakes of Paradise Engineering cover you, or succumb to the growing Global Communication-esque fuzzy patches of Models Of Wellbeing. All in all, this is an enchanting work, and a bold step for someone who could have just laid out some fat drums and let his Leisure System reputation do the talking.Utility by BarkerScroll the full best-of-2019 list here.18 – J Majik – Full Circle (Infrared)J Majik made his name with Metalheadz, which contrary to popular belief is not a Cyberman sex club but is instead one of the leading jungle music labels co-founded by everyone's favourite classical music conductor Goldie.And that pretty much sums up what's on offer. Full Circle offers superbly retro drum ‘n’ bass noises: there are tingly bits which sound like heaven and busy drums that sound like hell and sassy vocals that sound like somewhere inbetween.As with LTJ Bukem back in ye olden days, this has all the energy of those smoke-filled d'n'b clubs. The chords swell, the amen breaks spiral, the bass shudders, and the result is gorgeous. The beautiful break-down and beat drop in Red Circle is worth the price of the stream alone.You might not be into drum 'n' bass. This is an excellent starting point because, to slightly misquote Tricky, it's brand new, it's retro. And yes, I am also wondering how Cybermen have sex. Must be something to do with pipes.J Majik - Full Circle Album by Infrared RecordsScroll the full best-of-2019 list here.19 – Move D – Building Bridges (Aus Music)You know when you bump into someone outside the post office and you can't immediately place the face because it's Geoff from skydiving club and you've never seen Geoff without his flying cap never mind with a first-class envelope in his hand?I had a similar experience with Move D. Building Bridges, a nifty collection of light-touch house music, reminded me that perhaps I'd come across ole D before. And as it turns out, I had. Move D had a track on the seminal 1990s compilation series Trance Europe Express. Of course. I remember now.This all makes sense, because this album, recorded in Heidelberg over the past 20 years, shows all the skills of a veteran producer. The machines don't just run, they dance: the patterns they create will slowly seep under your skin. It's house music for techno fans.And despite the breezy pace on display, there's something melancholic left in the spaces. Just listen to those echoes on Dots. Or the pause for reflection on Transit. Check out the album's continuous mix if you can, because that's going to be some journey. All the way to the post office and beyond.Building Bridges by Move DScroll the full best-of-2019 list here.20 – Cain – The Collection 2014-2019 (Highlife)I've been anticipating Cain's debut album since this blog post in 2015. \"More of this playfulness!\" I demanded like a spoilt king firing chicken bones at a jester's feet. And finally, the former bagpipe playing highlander has dropped that much-anticipated debut.Except it's not what I expected. The Collection, as its title suggests, is a collection of his pan-global dance music that's been piling up over the past few years. I'd rather be reviewing a proper studio album rather than a compilation, but I'll take what I've been given — because this is great.The beats are metronomic, such as the 4/4 clonks on Eshu. This could be alienating, but a ghostly African chant or a shashaying sitar is never far away. It's a globe-hopping experience, and yet when a snaking acid line drops, such as on Gordito, it never seems out of place.There's no-one else out there like Cain: it's so damn fun. The jester is dancing and I like it. Now can I get out of these king robes, please? There's some serious chafing going on here, and the crown doesn't match my eyes.CAIN - The Collection 2014-2019 by Huntleys + PalmersScroll the full best-of-2019 list here."},

All of the following longlisted albums can probably be filed under \"experimental\".I loved the attention-deficit collage that was Madteo's Dropped Out Sunshine (DDS), which at points felt so tightly wound-up, I thought my ears were going to snap. Berlin artist Ziúr took a similar ear-bending route on ATØ (Planet Mu), an album that chewed up pop music and spat out a tasty techno fusion. This all sounds very Holly Herndon, which is good because she also had an album out this year. Proto (4AD) was superbly enchanting.For Plastic Anniversary (Thrill Jockey), Matmos made a special edition that was \"rendered virtually unplayable by the plastic floating within\". The clicks and squeaks of the album itself were welcome, as was its green message. Meanwhile, Boreal Massif took on the theme of climate extinction with the trippy meditations and drony vibes of We All Have An Impact (Pessimist Productions).Efdemin's New Atlantis (Ostgut Ton) gave us banging hippy techno leavened with dulcimers, hurdy-gurdy and a smidgeon of Francis Bacon. The multi-abstract ambience of Klein's Lifetime (ijn inc) included elements of light jazz, southern gospel and what sounded like a marching band being fed through a mincer.33EMYBW called the electrotribal Arthropods (SVBKVLT) \"limb dance” as she pushed the boundaries of the experimental Shanghai club scene. And finally for this section, I liked the playful beats of Violet's Bed of Roses (Dark Entries) — and yes, it's named after a Bon Jovi song.DROPPED OUT SUNSHINE LP by MADTEOATØ by ZiúrScroll the full best-of-2019 list here.Soon, we'll get our teeth into the top 20 best electronic music albums of 2019, like a narwhal savaging an unsuspecting squid. But first let's get some special mentions out of the way.When I compile my list, I have a set of fuzzy rules in my head. To be included, an album must be in the vein of modern, post-Aphex electronic music, but that leaves things pretty wide open. Nothing too poppy, although the list has pop elements. Don't genre-jump into hip hop, although the list will certainly have elements of this too.I also try not to include compilations, although watch me break this rule almost immediately with the album I've placed at number 20. This does mean there's no space for Burial's Tunes 2011 to 2019 (Hyperdub) nor for Autechre's Warp Tapes 89-93.I've also been strict about the definition of an album, so I'm sadly not including the return of Andy Stott on the EP It Should Be Us (Modern Love) nor, controversially, am I including Underworld's spectacular and impressive Drift project because there's so much of it, it would have ground this process to a halt.And finally, I have a new rule: if I don't like it, I won't mention it. In previous years, I thought it was important to be comprehensive and I included in my longlist albums that I wasn't interested in but were important enough to mention. As if I this site was some kind of electronic music almanac rather than just a daft writer in his underpants mashing a keyboard with his fists.

Numbers 20 to 11 today, then the top ten tomorrow. It will culminate in the reveal of the number one Best Electronic Music Album of 2019, which should be at 1.30pm tomorrow, new years eve.That'll give you plenty of time before your evening celebrations to nip to Our Price or Woolworths and buy the best album on CD. People still do that, right?A couple of things to remember:Firstly, do not take this too seriously: ask me again in a week and I'll no doubt have a different list: top ten household whisks or something. Everyone just chill.Secondly, it's is only my opinion, but my opinion is also fact, and facts are law, so to avoid jail you must take all of this very seriously indeed.Throughout the top 20, I will intersperse bonus \"best-of-the-rest\" blog posts outlining literally billions of albums that didn't make my final list.

Because they are using presets and some pretty basic plug-ins, their instrumental YouTube covers of Bernard & chums are not as well produced as the originals. That's like comparing a crayon drawing of a warthog stuck to your bathroom cabinet to a real warthog furiously trying to mate with your bathroom sink's overflow pipehole. You'll never get it in, Porkles. YOU'LL NEVER GET IT IN.However, what is delightful is what Mkaymufc does with their limitations: there are some pretty detailed covers here, full of heart. There's something so comforting about a Midi-quality bass drum in a era of over-production. And like a cat following a laser along a carpet, you can watch it play along from start to finish in FruityLoops (now called FL Studio).Sometimes it doesn't work: Electronic's Soviet doesn't come across well.

I don't have parents, so there's no-one to argue with about Brexit while passively-aggressively chewing undercooked sprouts. And I don't have a television, so while you're bombarded with a gaudy torrent of Chrimbo ads, I'm just staring at the patch of carpet where my telly used to be. Bliss.That said, it can be a lonesome time because everything's so family-oriented. Most Christmases, I delve into creative projects and spend as much time with friends as possible. January and February should have their own Christmases so we can continue to distract ourselves from the dank cold with booze and pals and shiny things.The other day it occurred to me that \"ho ho ho\" is \"oh oh oh\" backwards, which is a lyric from Beyoncé's Single Ladies. I'm not quite sure what to do with this information, other than posit that Father Christmas is the opposite to Queen Beyoncé. The Anti-Bey, if you will. Next time you're sitting on a Santa's knee, ask him if he hates Beyoncé.What's my advice for Christmas? Don't stand in your chimney place because if Santa comes down at the wrong angle, you're going to find yourself right up Father Christmas's butt. No-one wants to spend the festive season wedged up Santa Claus, no matter how Christmassy you're feeling. Not that anyone has chimneys anymore. Or butts. I blame Brexit Britain.In summary, festive fiddlesticks to you and your loved ones. Maybe have a read of this 2006 Xmas Q&A in which I (a) still annoyingly call Christmas \"chrimbo\" and (b) seem to promise never to mention Christmas again.

{"title": "My 5 favourite films of 2019 (in alphabetical order)", "date": "Dec 21, 2019", "text": "Cinema trips are always difficult. I need space for my three buckets of popcorn and a mop for when I fill my supersize Pepsi with nachos. And there's never anywhere to put my portable foot spa.Despite this, I did get to see some films this year. So here are five films, or \"movies\" if you are modern, that I especially enjoyed in 2019. Incidentally, the final film here was released in 2018 in the States, but 2019 here, so if you are American, please close your eyes when you get to that bit. Thanks.Oh and this will annoy the purists. This is not a top five: I love them all equally. I wanted to rank them, but I chickened out. Does that upset you? What are you going to do about it? Report me to the list police? Huh? HUH?So in alphabetical order...BooksmartThis Olivia Wilde comedy indulged in some pretty basic high school jinks, hence comparisons to Superbad. But thanks to great leads and some heavily-laced strawberries, it felt truly original. The chemistry between Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever was sparkier than the band Sparks playing with sparklers: and indeed, the film was at its best when they were just being friends together.I loved Billie Lourd's performance as Gigi, the drug-crazed non-friend who often went from nought to sixty in the blink of an eye. This goes for her script too, such as the line: \"I lost my virginity in what I thought was a park but it turned out to be a graveyard, and now the ghost spirits live inside my eggs waiting to be reborn.\"Knives OutEveryone seems to think Rian Johnson is a poop-head (technical film term) for The Last Jedi. Blah blah Star Wars whatever. He knocked it out of the park with Knives Out, with Daniel Craig sounding like Foghorn Leghorn on mushrooms. An ensemble piece full of brilliant anti-chemistry, best summed up by the ice and fire interactions of Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette.Like Booksmart, this took a familiar trope and did something new. Pure Miss Marple: murder, poison, knives, motive, means, opportunity. They even went with the final \"nobody leave this room\" detective explanation. A delight throughout led by the perfectly-cast vomiting nurse Ana de Armas, and with one of the funniest character introductions I've seen on film. *plays a single note on the piano*MidsommarI realise, by the way, I am saying nothing particular new and enlightening about any of these films. All of these opinions are available elsewhere on better-read websites. And so, yes, I'm going to refer to Ari Aster's Midsommar as a horror film that takes the usual (literal) darkness and fills it with blazing daylight, and is no less horrific for it.We're in obvious Wicker Man territory here, with its Scandi wonkiness providing a beautifully twisted core. And oh boy, it's nasty. At its heart though is a relationship statement grounded in the brilliantly human Florence Pugh (pictured, top), and a narrative arc as satisfying as the best short story. I don't know about you, but it proper put me off joining a cult.Pain & GloryCritics love films about people making films, but while the surname of Cinema Paradiso's protagonist Salvatore Di Vita suggests life, the name of Pain & Glory's fictional filmmaker Salvador Mallo suggests something more negative. The physicality in Antonio Banderas's performance is key, with his only true freedom from pain coming from swimming or, well, that would be a spoiler.The film plays with time to such an extent, you begin to question what's real. It looks incredible, is carefully paced, but never loses a raised eyebrow: there's a wall-decoration moment in a waiting room which was as silly as anything in Airplane! Pure Pedro Almodóvar and then some.The FavouriteI watched a period drama and loved it: this is a rare thing indeed. Below is a YouTube clip of the film's opening few minutes. Everything that's wonderful and strange about the film is here:The luxurious sets masking the grubby reality of humanity. The isolation and longing, often separated by mere moments. The \"macabre\" rabbits representing so much about Queen Anne. The fish-eye camera angles distancing us from the drama. The awkward title cards doing much the same thing. The saturated light casting main characters into shadow and reminding us there's another world outside. The horrible, horrible men. Olivia Coleman. Olivia flipping Coleman.The Favourite was constantly surprising and I want everything to look this odd from now on."},
{"title": "How do I compile my end-of-year list? Thanks for asking!", "date": "Dec 18, 2019", "text": "\"Just how do you compile your annual Best Electronic Albums list?\" people never ask me.It sounds complicated, listening to a zillion albums and shuffling them into some sort of order. And certainly there's lots of admin and lots of writing to be done.Actually, it's pretty easy if I follow some simple rules. Here's how I come up with my best-of-year list, posted on this blog at the end of every December.One.Firstly, I have to ask myself: what is an album. What *is* an album? No, seriously, what is one? I know they tend to be round unless they're made of internet. Are they like a frisbee? Is albums made of frisbees? What is music? Why are album? Huh?Two.When starting my list, I scratch around the bins at the back of Fat Roland Towers. There's usually a rat chewing on a Robson & Jerome CD, which I usually take as a sign. If someone's scrawled KASABIAN 4EVA next to the bottle recycling, it's straight into my top ten.Three.There is a practical experiment for choosing what goes into an end-of-year list. It involves: a copy of the British Book of Hit Singles; a blindfold; a set of darts. And if the dart should choose, for example, the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band who haven't graced the album charts for 45 years, it's tough. The dart has spoken. They're in my list.Four.Twenty phone calls, tonnes of texts, sometimes scented letters. Roland Rat never answers, but one day he will give me a tip for my year-end list. In that furry brain of his, there is a bottomless well of music knowledge. For now, I just stroke his framed photo, and hope.Five.I listen to music. Simple, I just listen to music. Unfortunately this never works because I have replaced my ears with eggs, and eggs are notoriously bad as audio receptors. I once replaced my knees with a small mining village in the Balkans, but the neighbours complained due to the noise.Seven.When writing your list, skip a number. No-one ever notices, and it's less work for you.Eight.Chant this incantation: huthatha baloobie flam flam yaargle butt. Then whittle a candle into a stake and bury it in a south-westerly position. When the moon is full, run about with your clothes off. None of this helps the year-end list, but it sure does pass the time.Nine.Go to the internet. Press control-A, or command-A if you're fancy. This will highlight the entire world wide web. Paste this into your list, making sure you choose \"text only\". Bang. A billion words. Somewhere in there will be the best albums of the year, a sonic record needle in a towering information haystack. You will experience a glowing satisfaction that you technically - TECHNICALLY - finished the job of end-of-year listing.Ten.Don't bother. Wait until I write the Best Electronic Albums of 2019, due to hit this blog before the end of the year. I'm not sure of the date yet: it depends on how much chocolate I eat at Christmas and whether I get into a fight with a reindeer again.Further Fats: All of the previous end-of-year lists (2009–2018)"},

But on Thursday, the general public voted for a blue-tentacled behemoth of pain and destruction, and now all the bunnies are dead.I am, of course, talking about the 2019 general election in which a floppy-haired buffoon got a billion people to vote for him. I'm not sure what happens next, but I think all the poor people get deported to Brussels while we spend £350 million turning hospitals into whiff-whaff clubs.The election was a conversation which essentially went like this:\"How about this?\" [holds up dead cat]\"Nah.\"\"This?\" [holds up turd on a stick]\"Nah.\"\"What about this?\" [holds up Daft Punk's Get Lucky]\"Come on now.\"\"All I've got left is this.\" [holds up actually racist Bullingdon thug]\"Mmmm, yes!\" [rubs over body for next 5 years]I started election day keyholding for a polling station in a safe Labour constituency, and ended the day in A&E with a sprained foot. I'd done my foot in a few days ago, as mentioned here. I'd stumbled on a broken sloping pavement covered in ice, unseen because of a broken street light – it was a live-action health and safety video demonstration. My foot probably flared up again on Thursday because it was a Corbynista nervous about the election result.The emergency room was packed to the rafters, and someone in the queue ahead of me collapsed, I suspect at the cost of the wifi. The doctor showed me a fuzzy x-ray of my foot, which had as much clarity as a Lib Dem bar chart. He said my foot won't heal until we get Brexit done.Thankfully, this is the season of Christmas ghosts, and I fully expect Greta Thunberg to descend on a heavenly cloud to cure my painful foot. She's good, isn't she. I found Thursday's election result hard to understand, but folks like Greta give me a huge amount of hope that one day the bunnies will frolic again.We might as well fill 10 Downing Street with spiders for all the good this new government will do. But as we limp through the next five years – literally for some of us – there's an opportunity. Let's respond to the election result by being active, being practical, and being creative.Make your new year resolutions now. Do something special.

{"title": "What is the most successful \"Dance\" single of all time?", "date": "Dec 9, 2019", "text": "Dance Monkey by Tones And I has just clocked up its tenth week at the top of the UK singles chart. It's the longest running number one single since Ed Sheeran's all-dominating Shape Of You in 2017.In 2016, Drake enjoyed a massive stint at number one when One Dance spent over three months in the top spot. Which makes Dance Monkey the most successful \"Dance\" single since One Dance.Which raises a hugely important question. What is the most successful \"Dance\" single of all time? You are a lucky blog reader because I'm about to give you the answer.1. One DanceDrake does indeed have the most successful \"Dance\" single of all time. It locked out the top spot for 15 weeks, keeping the likes of Rihanna, Calvin Harris and Justin flipping Timberlake at number two. Drake is also the most successful duck-named pop star since Howard Donald from Take That.2. Dance MonkeyThere she is. Tones (pictured top) has the second most successful \"Dance\" single ever. We're living in classic times for singles having the word \"dance\" in the title. Apparently the former busker has been at number one in Australia since the dawn of time.3. Rhythm Is A DancerI'm as serious as cancer when I say Snap! have the third most successful \"Dance\" track of all time, topping the charts for six weeks in 1992 and knocking Jimmy Nail off number one. After his phenomenal success with Snap!, square-headed rapper Turbo B went on to open a specialist cheese shop in Hull.4. Dancing QueenThat wasn't true about the cheese shop. I went off the rails for a second there. I've got loads of tabs open, but not a single one about Turbo B's post-Snap! career. I should have made more of an effort to look him up, rather than make random punts about cheese, and I do apologise.Disqualified – I Don't Feel Like Dancin'The whole thing's gone flat because of my cheese shop stupidity. I can't even make the final joke about the Scissor Sisters being \"anti-dance\" because they don't feel like dancing. If I made that joke now, it wouldn't work because you'd be thinking about my Turbo B lie too much. I didn't even explain anything about Abba being number four. Things have really gone off the rails.So there we go. Now you know what the most successful \"Dance\" single is. You'd buy speciality cheese from him, wouldn't you? He's got that kind of face.

Here are five pop star anagrams to solve. They are all acts that had a song in the UK top 40 singles chart at Halloween 1989. The first, third and last are solo artists, and the other two are groups.

The question was: what was your favourite album of the past decade. It's a humdinger, right?It's probably the most vexing question ever to be asked of a member of the public. Worse than Brexit, worse than gold dress or blue dress, worse than Gareth Gates versus Will Young.The people asking were Picky B*stards, a name I've had to censor so my blog doesn't fall foul of swear filters. I have to be honest: a few brain cogs fell out. Choosing the best album in a ten-year period is like choosing which puppy to shove into a blender, but in a good way. That said, when the answer came, it came easily. It hit me like a bl*ning fl*pd*bble.In fact, there are few other albums so closely woven into my life over the past few years than the album I've chosen. It's Kiasmos by Kiasmos (pictured), a work I once rated as the third best album of 2014 but have now very much promoted it to legendary status inside my own noggin.Read more about my choice of Kiasmos among the Picky Bs list here.Further Fats: The 5 best electronic music tracks of the decade so far (2017)"},

According to the wisdom of West, he's either the greatest or God's vessel or bigger than PJ & Duncan. Kanye's simply following in the size 92 boots of boastful rappers, a path well trodden by Public Enemy and Method Man and the like. It's all standard stuff.Although perhaps Chuck D had more of a purpose: blazing a trail to empower people of colour, speaking truth to authority and building an empire along the way. With Kanye it somehow seems so much more capitalist, more commercial and perhaps more empty.It does mean, though, it's difficult to listen to new Kanye material without sensing the eccentric Trump-ian ego behind the work. And that's a shame because I missed out on much of his earlier material, when he was proper good. When College Dropout appeared in the mid-noughties, I'd been through my hip-hop phase. And what a phase. Vanilla Ice, Snap, John Barnes.Maybe I could learn something from Mr West. I should be more boastful, because fake confidence breeds real confidence. Yeah. I'm going to do it.

Got proudI went to Didsbury Pride, which is a celebration of LGBTQ+ people by Emmanuel church in Manchester, the church I went to for many years back in the olden days. It's a wonderful thing, and when I got there everyone was drinking spirits and dancing to the Spice Girls. I didn't recognise anyone, so I hung around awkwardly for ten minutes and then went home. Ah well. It's still a wonderful thing.2. Got sillyI co-hosted Bad Language, the monthly spoken word night I run with Joe Daly. I'd missed the July one as I was in Edinburgh, so it was great to be back. And for some reason it was packed. Mid-week after a bank holiday weekend and everyone came out to party. Nutters, the lot of you. I'd been to a funeral earlier in the day, so it was just the tonic to be silly in front of an audience all night.3. Got confusedThis happened in a coffee shop:Me: What drinks do you have that don't have tea or coffee in?Barista: You don't drink coffee?Me: No.Barista: How about a tea?Me: I don't drink tea. I'd like an iced drink.2nd barista walking in: You don't drink coffee or ICE?!4. Got annoyedI saw Toy Story 4 and blubbed. I always blub at films. Oh and I started series two of Mindhunter, a grisly serial killer drama where you don't really see the grisly bits. It's such a good programme, although it fell for a well-worn trope. In one scene, like so many other programmes, they dubbed feedback over people talking talk into microphones. This doesn't happen unless sound is being mismanaged or it's an actual soundcheck. Stop doing it, programme makers! *squeeeals*5. Got listenin'I've been listening to things. Every other day on my Twitter account, I post a \"you should be listening to\" recommendation, old or new or somewhere inbetween. I've recently plugged Antwood, D-Shake, Underworld, Daphni and Jamie xx. To hear my nuggets of audio wisdom. follow me on the tweets."},

They also helped define modern techno through the rise of Detroit house and the Hacienda. Wikipedia also says 808's Graham Massey was a member of the Barbie Girl Danish pop band Aqua, but I’m pretty sure they’re linking to the wrong Aqua there.The band’s comeback album is Transmission Suite - their first for seventeen years. In the past, they’ve blurted out quite dense techno, but this new material feels looser. It’s acid-tweakin’ paranoid rave gubbins by grizzled Mancunians who get drug flashbacks when taking their Rennie’s. Sometimes old ravers slow down, but there’s plenty of improvisational energy in this new material.They recorded it at the old Granada studios in Manchester, formerly home to TV broadcasts like Coronation Street, World In Action and, er, The Chase. The nicest thing is you can feel Manchester’s club history running through Transmission Suite like day-glo varicose veins: it’s giving me flashbacks of gigs at the Boardwalk and Sankeys Soap.There's also a strong feeling of paranoia in their new work - very appropriate for our current times, I think.

There are three reasons for this.1. I increased my flyering activity, so I spent time prowling Lothian boulevards instead of blogging.2. After my final show, I went to a tonne of other shows like a right old louche. I had so much fun, I missed my pre-booked train home by a full 24 hours.3. This isn't Watch Mojo with its constant promise of content, content and more content, jeez gimme a break.My final Seven Inch shows were storming. No, really. I know Fringe artists present a positive side to keep the PR bubble unpopped, but this was a total blast. Great audiences, with people literally crying laughing. I've had so much fun.The last show of my run was on my birthday, so the audience sang - you guessed it - happy birthday. I didn't get any cake though which, for those of you that have seen the Fringe show, you'll agree is very much in the spirit of Seven Inch.Seven Inch gathered real momentum in the last third of its run, with people turning up through word-of-mouth. Actual real people - they weren't made of paper, honest. Audience donations reached in triple-figures per performance, which I've not had before. Slower chunks of the original show have been replaced with stuff that's quicker, sharper, in-your-face.However, unlike my first show in 2015, I didn't get any reviews, possibly because most short-run free shows don't get much press interest. What I have ended up with, however, is a production with more heart and more comedy than the Lowry version. I also have something that I can tour - watch this space.I am now skint. This was my most advertised and most flyered show yet, and all that cost money. *rolls up trousers, puts on flat cap, asks for more gruel* You can help me be less skint by coming to see me live - I've updated my gig page here. Oh and you can read more about Seven Inch in this blog posts here.Photo: Loud Poets"},

Big oval costumes with leg holes, but no arm holes or eye holes. Chaos.The last few days performing Fat Roland: Seven Inch at the 2019 Edinburgh Fringe have been great fun. My latest three audiences have been, in order:1. Staggeringly sozzled. A hen-do style birthday pub crawl came to my show and, woah, they were boisterous. The sober section of the audience looked on with delight as I fought to keep the show on track. Very funny.2. Stupendously soaking. The audience enjoyed the show, but they'd just been gushed on by torrential rain, so I felt a bit sorry for them. A little quieter than usual.3. Sooooo celebratory. A packed crowd who gave me my strongest audience reaction ever at the Fringe. A full five-star fun fest. What a treat. Shout out to the Canadian who high-fived me for mentioning Bran Van 3000!I did an open spot at Comedy Shorts, a compilation of various funny shows. It went down really well, I think. Part of my strategy putting on Seven Inch is to enable me to move more into the alternative comedy scene, and Comedy Shorts felt like a good indicator.I've been catching up with friends where I can, and with only three more shows to do, the end is in sight. I got some emergency flyers printed yesterday. I've given away so many, I nearly ran out.There I am, above, handing out flyers. It's a nice flyer. I drew it all by myself.

Both were UK top 40 hits - I know that because I taped the charts religiously every week: both songs would have degraded gloriously as I tape-to-tape copied them onto successive home compilations. Aside from loving the electronic simplicity of the records, having eponymous songs seemed weirdly rebellious.Then came the Artificial Intelligence compilations, my musical fulcrum from which everything spewed, which featured Polygon Window, The Black Dog, Beaumont Hannant and B12. Warp also gave us some incredibly beautiful artist albums, most notably from - of course - Aphex Twin, Boards Of Canada, Autechre and Richard H Kirk. You already know this.I remember Warp's tectonic plates shifting when they moved to London. A bit like when Boddingtons shut down their Manchester brewery. They widened their electronic remit (Warp, that is, not Boddies), bringing in acts like Anti Pop Consortium who sounded wonky and wild. And now they rule the world with artists like Flying Lotus, Plaid, Bibio, Kelela and Oneohtrix Point Never. You can catch a stack of the label's 30th anniversary broadcasts here.Happy birthday, Warp. I'm glad you're still going strong, and I'm glad you're still putting out music by the likes of Lorenzo Senni, which has all the vital energy as your early stuff. I'll be forever grateful to the label being a beacon of quality techno, and the basis for a lot of further record browsing across a zillion other labels.If I had one criticism, it would be that there doesn't seem to be much eponymous song titling these days. Just saying. If you want to release Fat Roland's Fat Roland, you know who to call."},
{"title": "What was your first concert?", "date": "Jun 24, 2019", "text": "There's a \"post your replies\" meme flapping around Facebook at the moment where you bang on about gigs you've been to and no-one reads it because no-one cares what gigs you've been to.So I thought I'd use it as the basis of a blog post.First concert? James at GMEX, 1993, with Radiohead supporting. HOW COOL AM I??!?!? I'd seen a stack of smaller things before that, most likely Christian artists because I was a good church boy back then, and I'd been a music columnist since 1991 so I'd no doubt seen a tonne of local bands. James was the first one I remember, and it's also the one that makes me look coolest, but it was probably my 50th gig and the reality is that I really can't remember my first gig.Latest concert? It was a couple of friends bands a few days ago: Geisterhouse and Rickerly. Geisterhouse is an angular man with an angular guitar, and Rickerly is a masked spirit who oozes samples. They're both great.Next concert? When I wrote this, it was Plaid this coming Saturday. However, Saturday's now been and gone due to the rules of time, so it's probably the Subliminal Impulse festival.Best concert? Almost impossible to say. There was Pulp's Common People tour, and Flaming Lips at Jodrell Bank, and Smashing Pumpkins making the Manchester (Nynex!) Arena feel small, and the Manics doing similar in the same venue, and there's almost every Orbital gig since 1995, and a zillion Bjork gigs, and the Chemical Brothers back in the day, and Blame & Bukem, and Jon flipping Hopkins. It also has to be said that Kylie puts on an astonishing show too.Worst concert? I used to be a full-time music journalist so could probably list a hundred names here. I accidentally saw Ocean Colour Scene once and that was a dark day.Who have you seen most? No surprise here when I say Orbital: I first saw them at Tribal Gathering in ye olden days, and most recently had my ears blasted off at the Manchester Apollo. Also I kept getting free tickets to the Levellers back in the 1990s, so them too. Levellers! Remember them? Oh my.Best concert venue? I have a soft spot for Manchester Apollo, but I have to give a shout out to smaller venues like Hidden, The Peer Hat and Aatma.Worst concert venue? A place in Preston that made farts out of Orbital's bass sound, can't remember the name. That said, I bought Orbital's brown album in 1993 on the strength of an NME review which praised one of the tracks for sounding like an \"extended fart\", or words of that ilk.Who have you not seen but want to? I never saw The Fall despite numerous chances to. And New Order, who I may or may not have seen due to the fogginess of my raving days but I don't think so. And PJ Harvey. I could just list band names here. Pink Floyd. Bananarama. Madonna. Are you even reading this? Westlife. The Cheeky Girls. Crazy Frog.Ultimately, you don't care what gigs I've been to: it's such a personal thing, seeing all that stuff with your eyes, feeling all that bass in your gut. Still.

Righto - carry on...Who they sound like according to Spotify's recommendations: A lovely pair of woolly trousers.... actually it doesn't say that, but Spotify's recommendations are pretty weakMost comforting musical element: The memory of playing this on vinyl over and over again, alongside Autechre's Incunabula, without - at that stage - knowing much about either artistLeast comforting musical element: The fact that Kirk's had so many aliases and projects (Cabaret Voltaire, Sandoz, Electronic Eye, Sweet Exorcist), the chances are you're listening to Richard H Kirk AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ITWhat it's like being smothered by (in a good way): A lovely, heaving, moist Fat Roland, possibly lubricated with LurpakComfort food it should be paired with: A lovely salad - you've had far too much comfort food during this blog series and you're looking a little green around the gillsPublic figure I would recommend this album to so they can chill the heck out: None of them: I'm keeping this album all to myself, so important was it to me back in t'dayWhat the opposite of this album sounds like: A basket of puppies being poured into a shredder, or perhaps a baby hippo in a blender, or maybe a giraffe entangled in the mechanical jaws of a city-destroying megabot - basically, anything that's horribleClick here to see the comfort listening series in full - thanks for reading.Number 2 in my top ten comfort-listens is The Black Dog's Radio Dogma Podcast name: Radio Dogma Artist: The Black DogWho they sound like according to Spotify's recommendations: Ah!

It wasn't to be.Firstly, my appearance at a spoken word night in Liverpool was kiboshed by a power cut. The venue was without electricity and apparently my performance wasn't going to be electric enough to compensate. We quickly rescheduled. One of them things, innit.That wasn't the annoying bit. I'd decided to be clever and get to Liverpool early to check out The Beatles Story, an exhibition about the Merseybeat band that invented the submarine or something. I'm working on a commission and I was hoping to foment some fab four fun in my brain follicles.I hadn't counted on our awful trains. They weren't just delayed - they were deleted. Not a single train in my local area for hours. Signalling failure.But Fat Roland, I hear you say, this can't just be a blog post moaning about trains not being on time.Yes it is. It is a flipping blog post moaning about trains being rubbish. Not a single train. FOR HOURS. I went to see some superhero thing at the cinema instead - the one with the glowy woman and Samuel L Jackson looking about 12. It was quite fun, but it was no trip to a Beatles museum.Trains, you ruined my afternoon. I did eventually get to Liverpool, moments before I learned of the power cut, and even that trip was a litany of lateness and last-minute platform changes.Maybe this blog should be about trains. Forget electronic music.

{"title": "Being Frank & Bobbins: celebrating the life of Chris Sievey", "date": "Apr 29, 2019", "text": "Being Frank: The Chris Sievey Story is out on DVD today. Do get it if you can. It's a glorious celebration of a man who was endlessly creative, gleefully eccentric and ultimately tragic. Here's the cartoon me holding the DVD for dear life.If you're quick, you can just about catch the Frank Sidebottom Bobbins exhibition at Manchester Central Library. It closes tomorrow (\"one of them Tuesdays\", says the publicity). Pictured here is his actual head - he only ever had two, and this is the only one that survives.Incidentally, and this is a total side note, I'm currently watching the Batman prequel Gotham. I've had to stop watching because the scripting is so shoddy. In the episode I've just seen, a whole bunch of people have been murdered, each one with their throats slit. It's how they connected the murders.Twenty minutes later, someone mentions in passing that they also had crosses drawn on their forehead in blood. Mentioned in passing? What? Surely THAT would be up-front and centre much earlier on. Gah.If only they took a Batbottom and Bobbins route instead (pictured above).One thing about the exhibition is that there are lot of lists. Pages and pages of lists. We've all made and neglected to-do lists, but Chris Sievey made it into an artform. There's one graph-paper page of things to do, segmented into thematic sections, tonnes of to-dos each with its own little hand-drawn tick box. Not a single thing was ticked off. I relate.Pictured above is a fun list - Frank Sidebottom's top 5 computers. I had a Spectrum 2.Considering the record shop theme of Fat Roland: Seven Inch at the Edinburgh Fringe (SEO-friendly plug), I had to snap this highly advanced record player. One of the key themes of Being Frank is Chris Sievey's music career, as it happens - especially the moment a badly-timed strike scuppered his chance at stardom.I suppose if he'd been more successful, there wouldn't have been a spirited crowd-funding campaign to get Being Frank made, and I wouldn't have got my name in the credits as a backer, and there wouldn't have been such a cluttered and creative exhibition in Manchester which closes tomorrow (one of them Tuesdays).Incidentally, in this blog post I have very secretly hidden a photograph of me meeting Frank Sidebottom ages ago. Can you spot it?"},

Songs that have been cut-and-shut together, like a Mini Metro welded to a Transit Van: totally unofficial, sometimes ugly, potential death trap.I think I have found the perfect PSB mashup, and it comes from the bottom drawer of their back catalogue. Into The Minimal Groove mixes Minimal (Tocadisco's Sunday At Space Remix) with Madonna's Into The Groove.Whoever did this spent a lot of time working on Madge's vocals. They work brilliantly over a track that likes to take its time: it's full of surprises.And like my dodgy cover version of Carly Rae Jepson, they've kept the title hook until much later in the track - it's five minutes before Madonna says \"get into the groove\", and even then it almost passes by unnoticed. A deliberate trick to neutralise the original track to make something new and interesting.I can't stop listening to it. You could say.... ahem... [steps closer to microphone] that I have very much got into its groove.There's a video of sorts, which you can watch here."},

And I tried to read Morrissey's List of the Lost before firing out this status update on Facebook:\"Morrissey's novel. I read some of it yesterday. You know how sometimes people write like teenagers with no knowledge of the well-worn amateur mistakes a lot of beginner writers make? The kind of adverb-strewn purple prose on which we look back and blush, with the sentences all imprecise and confused because when we were young that's how our minds worked? Morrissey should aim to get to that level before putting out another book.\"A friend once gifted me John Lennon's nonsensical books, and I really value them. And I've probably read more histories of rave than is wise for one person. I inhale almost anything Underworld-related. Oh and I used to read the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles even though it was just lists.The problem is when you're buying a musician's book, it could be coffee table dribble with glossy but anodyne photographs, or some kind of ego trip from a lyricist who thinks they can write something other than lyrics.Or if you're Madonna, just a load of people having sex all over the pages and everything sticking together. Yeeps.The most interesting one in those Official Charts picks is Stormzy's Rise Up, which launches his #Merky Books imprint that's dedicated to encouraging young writers with submission opportunities and internships. He's a good chap, that Stormzy.As for my should-read pile, I should read How Music Works by David Byrne. I need to get my hands on that Beastie Boys Book that came out before Christmas.

Seb WildbloodSeb Wildblood's Grab The Wheel, an EP from last year which is only just tugging on my musical heartstrings now. His deep house is simple, almost by-the-numbers in its structure - but boy, it's weedled up my pee-hole right into my guts. In a good way.4. Four TetKieran 'Four Tet' Hebden still refuses to tell anyone what he did with the first three Tets. While we wait for an answer, we'll have to make do with this cheery little album from 2017.

I just had that feeling on hearing about the death of Talk Talk's Mark Hollis.Not that it's a choice between them, of course. It's weird, isn't it, how these strangers affect us so much, especially a stranger who was unlikely in any case to ever produce music again.Talk Talk were one of the few 1980s bands who cut across the rave era into my 1990s brain. Scratch beneath the surface of the main singles It's My Life and Life's What You Make It, both of them whole loads of ace, and his talent shone brightly, albeit it awkwardly.What sad news (caveat: yet to be officially confirmed at the time of writing). Still, it does mean that in heaven right now, Mark Bell from LFO is making an experimental album with that incredible voice.Here are two bits of music.  Firstly a 1986 performance, complete with strangely intense percussion break-down - and 1980s haircuts (apart from Mark Hollis, who was beyond time). And secondly an uncredited piano performance on Unkle’s Psyence Fiction, his notes as reclusively minimal as you'd think.Pictured above: Mark Hollis superimposed on a background from the It's My Life video."},

Music has done quite well out of Franks. There's Frank Ocean, of course, and Frank Black from the Pixies. And Frank Sinatra, whose albums I own on vinyl because I am down with the kids.

It's so wrong.The wrongest I've ever been is about the 1989 house humpathon French Kiss by Lil Louis. I hated the track when it first came out. Why was that woman moaning all over the record? Was she hurt?Of course, now I recognise its place in history. Dance music was exploring its sexuality alongside some innovative tempo changes. And actually, it's a cracking tune.I also remember hating Snap's The Power on first listen. How could something so discordant get to number one? It's all wrong. I felt offended by it: triggered before 'being triggered' was even a thing.Naturally, I fell in love with the track: a dominating dance music classic. I was simply puzzled by the clash between the robust bad-boy rap, the jingling electro beat sampled from Doug Lazy's Let It Roll, and a whole bunch of chords that came in at different angles.I now realise that a lot of the best stuff is slightly off: clashy is good.And now something at the other end of the tonal scale: Air's Sexy Boy. So much cheese. So much soft cheese. Why would anyone like this?!I have since awoken to the sexy reality that Air's particular brand of spreadable sandwich filling was incredibly tasty, and I inserted, hur hur, the Moon Safari album into my CD player over and over again - until way past its use-by date.Three different examples in the dance music world.

{"title": "Fat Roland's February pop anagrams - number 4 is a doozy", "date": "Feb 6, 2019", "text": "Here's a quiz for you, readers. All you have to do is solve these band anagrams.Some of them are big chart-toppers. Some of them are more obscure. They date from present day back to ye olden days (i.e. 1960s). They cover various musical genres.Each name is followed by two numbers: the number of words in their name, and the year they scored their first UK chart hit.They are all band names, which suggests two or more members. This isn't always the case, however. It's fair to say that a couple of them have operated pretty much as solo acts under the same name at various points in their careers.Also:> If a name begins with \"The\", I have not included this in the anagram or the wordcount.> If there is a \"the\" later on in the name, this is included.> If a name contains a \"&\", I have converted this to \"and\".> If they've never had a UK hit single, instead of a year I have included a ~decade~ in which they first became well known(ish).Good luck!

After a teaser advert in a tube station, which displayed the name of the album so really was so much as teasing as being poked in the face with a telegraph pole, James Blake has blurted out a new album. It's called Assume Form.He's much more than a Singer, capital S, these days, with all his harmonies and sweetness. I'm an instrumentation junkie, preferring the punch of his 2010 single CMYK. Still, I'll give it a listen - his delicate vocals are like chocolate-dipped honey served on the eyelash of a unicorn.Second. Req is delivering us Tape Transport: 1994-2000. Contrary to what its title may suggest, it's not the chronicles of a troubled VHS delivery company during the rise of DVDs. The Brighton b-boy beatsmith has a truck full of rare and lost recordings. His Sketchbook album on Warp back in 2002 is well worth a listen.Third. There's also Mikron’s Severance, out now on Sheffield's Central Processing Unit. It's right lovely sounding and will tickle the ear of anyone into Detroit techno, Ulrich Schnauss and Boards of Canada.I review two of these in the next Electronic Sound magazine, which you have to buy otherwise James Blake will come round your hovel and tease you with a javelin.Clips below.

This month's always a slog. In the past I've found that little routines help make the trudge a bit easier. That might be anything from emptying the bin, to a regular food haunt, to scheduled writing sessions.Here are three small routines that helped this January. They're largely trivial, but they've added a spark to my month. 1. A tiny tweetOn every other day, I've tweeted a “you should be listening to” Spotify link. I might as well let you know what I'm plopping into my ears, and it somehow feels I'm being generous, despite it taking very little effort. See those tweets in my feed.2. Blogging!I've blogged every third day. The blog posts have been small: little notelets flapping on the thermals of the internet. It somehow centres me: this here website has been home to me for nearly 15 years. More importantly, it's kept my writing brain in gear. (Thank you for reading, by the way.)3. Total narcissismI've kept a weekly list of pats-on-the-back. A collection of private congratulations. It's all pretty dull. Things like hanging out with friends listening to Kraftwerk, completing a writing deadline, buying socks. In this most slushiest of seasons, it helps me remember the good things which so easily fade into the cold night.From the tweets to the blog posts to the lists, I've ended January feeling more positive than I usually go. Take THAT, metaphorical time dragon. Maybe you should try some tiny routines. Nothing big. Largely trivial. Something to add a spark."},

Here he is in 1989 tearing up the dancefloor and the chart, scoring the second of two top 40 hits under this particular alias.3. Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock - Get On The Dance FloorAlthough It Takes Two was Rob Base and E-Z's signature song, Get On The Dance Floor was the bigger chart hit, entering at number 30 on 8th January 1989 and peaking at number 14, a couple of places above Milli Vanilli.4. Turntable Orchestra - You're Gonna Miss MeI must admit, I don't remember this one, even though it uses as its beat the \"In My House\" breakdown on the Pet Shop Boy's remixed Always On My Mind. Anyway, there it is, scoring a tiny number 52 hit in the middle of January 1989.5.

And probably dribbling a bit.Find a friend. Try swapping your back-pocket cloakroom tickets by rubbing your bottoms together.2. WaveWave at your fellow ravers. Wave at the DJ. Wave at the bar staff. Wave at the bouncers. Wave at the strobe lights. Wave at the fire exit sign. Ask the fire exit sign's name. \"My name's Jeremy,\" says the fire exit sign. Oh good. Now, the fire exit sign's talking.3. Play pretend footballHave a pretend game of football. Kick a ball you've made up in your head. See if you can do a goal. Ten nil! Run around with your shirt over your head.Pretend everyone in the club is your grumpy neighbour, and ask them for your ball back. Ask everyone, one by one, even though you know the ball is pretend. Do it. It'll be hilarious.4. Wonder if you should have played pretend footballI'm not... I'm not sure I should have played pretend football  I'm at a rave. Everyone's dancing. I, uh, think that might have been a distraction. What was I thinking? I really need to get my head together. It's okay, it's okay. After tonight, I'll get it together. New start.

They were on the edge of my radar along with other double-z bands like ZZ Top, Yazz and We've Got A Fuzzbox And We're Gonna Use It. But with this self-titled Rezzett album they land squarely in my sights. Distorted tech noise and rusty ambience? Yes please, thank you Mrs Music. (Not a real person.)Rezzett is fuzzy, like an unshaven face or a neglected slice of bread. It's frequencies leak into areas they shouldn't, like a naughty paddling pool. It sounds off, like these similes. It's a scuffed-up science-fiction film set, but with Luke Abbott instead of Luke Skywalker: no JJ Abrams CGI lens flare here.It's techno and ambient and jungle and bass music all at the same time. When you think the album has settled into a pattern, it throws something deeply satisfying at you. Listen to how the skippy snares of Tarang beckon in a chord sequence ripped straight out of a power pop anthem, and yet it all still holds together. It's perfection.And most of all, it's properly curated. An album with shape, from the faded glows of Hala, to the dirty deconstructed house of Sexzzy Creep, to the whip-sharp junglism of Worst Ever Contender.

It's a bit like Bruno Brookes wandering off to his knitting circle in the middle of Top Of The Pops.Anyways, here is the final bunch of electronic noodlers that didn't quite make my final list.A jazz pianist and a cellist might not be natural territory for techno behemoth R&S, but Djrum’s Portrait With Firewood (R&S Records) produced some bass music on an epic scale. Elysia Crampton found a clattering joy in the balance between found sound and world music on Elysia Crampton (Break World Records). Mark Pritchard’s The Four Worlds (Warp Records) was worth it for the likeable washboard shuffle of Circle Of Fear. And Marquis Hawkes raised the flipping roof on The Marquis Of Hawkes (Houndstooth).DJ Koze created a deserved fuss with Knock Knock (Pampa), a collection of twitchy house music but not as you know it. I was perhaps less keen on its folky elements. Chris Carter, of Throbbing Gristle repute, managed to funnel several decades of electronic music into the excellent Chemistry Lessons Volume 1 (Mute). Astonishingly, Mr Fingers dropped his first album for 24 years in 2018: Cerebral Hemispheres (Alleviated Records) was as soulfully slick as you'd imagine. HVL’s Ostati (Organic Analogue Records) revived many memories of old raves and armchair techno listening.German glitchmeister Alva Noto gets his own paragraph. He brought us a minimal masterpiece with Unieqav (Noton) earlier this year, but he didn't stop there. His rare Newcastle live recording Live 2002 (Noton) with Ryoji Ikeda and the late Mika Vainio seemed to have its audience hair-spun with static. Also worth looking into is the architecture-inspired Glass (Noton) with Ryuichi Sakamoto: the pairs last work was The Revenant soundtrack with Leonardo DiCaprio getting jiggy with a bear.That was the tenth and final lot of also-rans for this 2018 countdown.

They're all house music, or influenced by house music, or have once been in a house with some house music.A choir from Hackney added a whole new direction for Simian Mobile Disco on Murmurations (Wichita) which led me to produce an alarmingly introspective review for Electronic Sound magazine (\"Life is a fragile path that sometimes leads us to thin places we’d rather avoid\"). There was solid house action on Specter’s Built To Last (Sound Signature): extra points for the insistent piano riff on Not New To This. I enjoyed the clean house stylings of Invisibility (Sushitech) from Romanian duo SIT – minimalism with sheen.Essaie Pas's ominous New Path (DFA Records) was \"enough to make you gleefully afraid of your own shadow\" (Electronic Sound again). There was a masterclass in shrink-wrapped drum programming on Konduku’s Kıran (Nous'klaer Audio). Russian artist Evgenii Fadeev sounded restless on Litie (Gost Zvuk), turning up those bpms for his AEM Rhythm Cascade persona. And on my notes for Beta Librae's Sanguine Bond (Incienso), I've just got the word \"hypnotic\". So it must have been hypnotic. Ahem.I liked rapper’s Galcher Lustwerk’s inconsequential chatter amid the smooth house of 200% Galcher (Lustwerk Music). RAMZi’s Phobiza Vol. 3: Amor Fati (FATi Records) was a heady mix of hazy house music. There was a dark urgency to Neville Watson's house breaks album The Midnight Orchard (Don't Be Afraid). Phew. Is this section over yet? It's going on a bit.Shinichi Atobe sounded perkier than usual on Heat (DDS), not least in part because of his perfectly ratcheted snares. Underground favourite DJ Bone spilled a load of bright Detroit bangers this year on A Piece Of Beyond (Subject Detroit) – expect the trilogy to complete in 2019. And finally I utterly overlooked SCNTST's Scenes And Sketches From The Lab (Boysnoize Records) despite a previous album of his being in my 2013 top ten. I only just spotted it now. Blast.

Also it’s nearly 1am when I’m writing this and I’m tired. Pfffrt.Compro will be best remembered for its techy rollers, its nu-school breaks, but at its heart is a precision-controlled ambient album. Indeed it’s nearly ten minutes before a proper beat lands, and even then it’s all tickled with twinkles, like that little glint in a hippo’s eye when it wears its first tutu.50 Euro To Break Boost is a hands-down classic: just the right amount of decay and delay, and a theme of crumbling structures echoed in its falling, shimmering chords. Beautiful.The fact that this is only at number five in this list just shows the strength on offer this year. Good work, music makers. Nice tutu, hippo. Where did that hippo come from?

A city vista. Lights twinkling in the darkness. A craft glides across the sky. The skyscrapers sweep away to the horizon.And then something terrifying happens. The second track Become Real starts fizzing at the two-minute mark, and the static shock never quite leaves. Something has awakened. This is not a city. This is a creature.I don’t know what’s possessed Ital Tek, but this is a frightening album, all portent and doom, fully ambient yet as emotionally percussive as all heck. His continued journey away from the dancefloor has produced his best album yet.The rising sun illuminates the city and the darkness curtains away. The grey buildings show themselves to the new day.

Let's get on with it.Almost making it into the final list was Marie Davidson, whose acclaimed fourth album Working Class Woman (Ninja Tune) had some of the best house tunes of the year –  ‘So Right’ and ‘Work It’ are so sparky (“I want to smell you, even from far away”). felicita’s hej (PC Music) mixed gentle piano with frequency-destroying digitalism: a curious mixture. Gender inequality and the refugee crisis informed the uneasiness on the ethereal club vibes of Deena Abdelwahed’s Khonnar (InFine Music).Jlin’s Autobiography (Planet Mu), written as a soundtrack to a ballet, sounded more introspective than usual, complete with piano ballad. The twisted electronics of Amnesia Scanner’s Another Life (PAN) put the ‘anger’ into ‘bangerz’. See what I did there? I am such a clever writer. Spiritflesh’s Spiritflesh (No Corner) was an industrial street-fight of gloomy mechanics.With track titles like Tunnel Stalker and Final Mercy, DJ Richard’s Dies Iræ X erox (Dial Records) was hardly going to be a bundle of laughs, but the lurking EMB-driven beats held their own dark optimism. The weaponised techno of Ancient Methods’ The Jericho Records (Ancient Methods) sounded like it had buried its way out of the earth’s core like some kind of mixing desk-tweaking mole, assuming you could get hardware that could work while encased in soil, which I don't think you can, got to be realistic about these things. *Such* a clever writer.Working Class Woman by Marie DavidsonAutobiography (Music from Wayne McGregor's Autobiography) by JlinScroll all of the best 2018 electronic albums by clicking here.7 – Martyn – Voids (Ostgut Ton)Martyn last appeared in this top ten in 2011, when the only thing we had to worry about was people rioting and tearing our city centres apart.Since then, something really significant happened. Martyn had a heart-attack. Yet instead of playing chess with a tall boke holding a scythe (ask your grandparents), he made this album.Voids is shuffling and dark, like a skellington in a closet. The chords on Nya are dour, and the suspended note on World Gate is unnerving. Yes, I said ‘skellington’.The highlight is Manchester, Martyn’s tribute to drum 'n' bass artist Marcus Intalex: “deep deep down, we’ve lost a big one”. Intalex’s name was encased in Manchester’s modern electronic music history like black pudding in a Manchester egg.Actually, staying on that theme for a moment… Manchester’s most characterful areas are currently being torn down by developers, in a more corporate reflection of the destruction of 2011. Progress isn’t wrong: we just need to remember what’s important as things move on. In a personal way, this album is a testament to that.Scroll all of the best 2018 electronic albums by clicking here.8 – Ceephax – Camelot Arcade (Waltzer)This might be the first time Ceephax has made my top ten. Well, fancy that. Arise, Sir Ceephax, and take your steed, whatever a steed is.Camelot Arcade is a whole theme park of fun. Thrill to the cheery chords of Trusthouse Forte! Woosh to the acid disco of Life Started Tomorrrow! Smile for the camera at the smooth 4/4 ride of The Green Night!Like most UK theme parks, there is a tinge of sadness here: there’s less happy acid and more thoughtfulness. He’s allowed the paint to peel in the damp weather, and let the bolts of the safety harnesses rust up a little. It’s a richer experience as a result.I still don’t know what a steed is.

I hope you kept your receipt.JK Flesh took great delight in pneumatically drilling our brain to an off-grey paste on New Horizon (Electric Deluxe). “This is my extravagant entrance for my show” boldly announced the scuzzed club anthems of Peder Mannerfelt’s Daily Routine (Peder Mannerfelt), a claustrophobic journey into a self-styled temporary psychosis. Demdike Stare’s Passion (Modern Love) was a pulsating patchwork of noise and jungle and nasty breaks.FORMA’s Semblance (Kranky) gave us some beautifully building arpeggios with a cosmic classical bent, while I held a candle or three for the slow-burning debut album from Bruce, Sonder Somatic (Hessle Audio). Rather less forgiving were the gorgeously grit-teethed beats of Chevel's Always Yours (Different Circles).Lorn discovered sobriety to produce a wonderfully dark new album Remnant (Wednesday Sound). Objekt moved away from techno for Cocoon Crush (PAN) into a world that seemed equally organic and robotic – it has been compared to Future Sound of London’s Lifeforms, and I can see why. And the post-club fuzz of Anthony Naples’s Take Me With You (Good Morning Tapes) included a beautiful dubby smoker’s version of John Barrys Midnight Cowboy.EDLX.058 New Horizon by JK FleshSemblance by FormaScroll all of the best 2018 electronic albums by clicking here."},

What was I doing? Oh yes. The countdown for the bestest electronic albums of 2018.Ross From Friends digs into his familial history to add heart to his debut album. It’s a wise move that lifts Family Portrait above the glut of usual house music albums.The Knife sounds like Burial transplanted into a future century. Thank God I’m A Lizard, named after it’s opening bedtime prayer, is a wafer-thin house beat that lifts into heavenly jazz.He allows vocal sprinkles to humanise the Four Tet-snappiness, whether that’s a soulful song or spoken snippets, and he’s not afraid to let a track break down into introspection.

The sheds aren't important. A few friends call me Two Sheds and that's all there is to it.”That, my readers, is a quote from the Monty Python sketch Arthur 'Two Sheds' Jackson, and indeed the creaking sound on arthur two sheds on Vester Koza’s debut album could indeed be a rusted shed door.There’s also a nod to Squarepusher’s My Red Hot Car in my well crap car – mardy mix. This Cheshire producer isn’t taking things too seriously.Why top ten? loader mither quickly became go-to ear-food for me, especially the hollow percussion of taped over the courtyard mix: it's got a kind of giddiness that became a personal theme for me in the latter part of this year.

Or try a birthday cake instead: ambient artist todos produced an engrossing 10th anniversary mix on Ten Years of A Strangely Isolated Place (A Strangely Isolated Place) that's well worth your attention. Meanwhile, Huerco S iced our ears with plenty of low-fuelled drones on Pendant’s Make Me Know You Sweet (West Mineral Ltd).I really need to know when to stop with a metaphor. Anyhoo... Brian Eno wrote Music For Installations (UMC) for people ogling sunflowers and melty clocks in art galleries. Meanwhile, house music seemed a key influence on the worldly ambient rhythms of Vakula’s Metaphors (Leleka). Spot the Apocalypse Now moments on Nmesh / Telepath’s ロストエデンへのパス (Dream Catalogue)Guitar was the driving force by Aussie ambientist Eleventeen Eston on At The Water (Growing Bin Records). I reckon Sarah Davachi’s achingly serene Let Night Come On Bells End The Day (Recital) could be a great going-to-sleep album, but in a good way. Although equally ambient, Grouper’s Grid Of Points (Kranky) was rather more rousing thanks to Liz Harris’s whispery vocals.If you're following this blog live, we're about to get into the top ten best electronic albums of 2018.

Alongside the synthetic electro of Squeeze, there’s strangled rave sirens (Elastic) and drunkenly wandering chord stabs (Repeater), all of which points towards club culture – yet far beyond it too.It has the overdriven aesthetic of Rustie and Errorsmith, with all the buttons turned up to red, and the minimalism of Lorenzo Senni, with all the buttons turned down to, er, a low-level colour. White? Black? Not brown. Let's not talk about brown again.Most remarkably, and this has probably not been said before, Gábor Lázár can drive a fricking car into space.

I declared him to have one of the best music tracks of the decade, and I once promised not to torture him.Considering Singularity can only ever live in the long shadow of its predecessor, the ground-breaking Immunity album, this is an astonishing achievement. Just listen to Everything Connected. Now listen to it again.Hopkins’ greatest achievement is balancing artistry with crowd-pleasing. Balancing pin-sharp production, as delicate as a snowflake, with fat filters and pyjama-pooping bass.A bit like me, really. I think of this blog as treading a fine line between snowflakes and pooping. Brown snow. That’s what this blog is.

Smith & Mighty reminded us of how good they were on Ashley Road Sessions 88-94 (Punch Drunk). And following the rerelease of his classic classic ‘If You’re Into It, I’m Out of It’, covered elsewhere in these blog posts, Christoph De Babalon’s brought us some drum ‘n’ bass rarities with Exquisite Angst (A Colourful Storm). Listen to that awkward drum loop of Are You Talking To Me? – no wonder Thom Yorke counted himself as a fan of De Babalon’s work.Now other stuff. The summer vibes were strong in the laid-back Detroit cuts of Jay Daniel’s Tala (Watusi High), while I enjoyed the wonky jazz of Palanquin Bearing Monkey on Yoshinori Hayashi’s Ambivalence (Smalltown Supersound). Ooo yes, and I can't forget the mystical ritualism of Aisha Devi's DNA Feelings (Houndstooth) – a strange but fascinating listen.Also not quite making the cut were the belly-dancing beats of TSVI’s Inner Worlds (Nervous Horizon), which mixed Sufi percussion with grubby grime rhythms. Finally for this section, the caustic sound of Renick Bell’s Turning Points (Seagrave) led the charge for code-based algorave, while Tadd ‘Dabrye’ Mullinix had the entire history of rave on his mind when making X-Altera’s X-Altera (Ghostly International), throwing a lot of jungle and techno at the wall, making the wall sound really good.Ashley Road Sessions 88-94 by Smith & MightyBroken Knowz by Jay DanielScroll all of the best 2018 electronic albums by clicking here.13 – Oneohtrix Point Never – Age Of (Warp Records)I once got trapped in a hotel fire exit staircase, with no way back into the main building. I was late for breakfast, and from that point I was the trapped-in-a-staircase guy.Aside from the fire safety concerns of a chain hotel using locked doors in a chuffing fire escape, that serves as a neat metaphor for Oneohtrix Point Never’s music. It’s difficult to get into because our mental doors are locked: we are trapped in the staircases of our usual music taste, and sometimes we need to smash through the doors of perception and smell Oneohtrix’s fire.Alright, the metaphor didn’t work. But what does work is Age Of’s bewildering collage of baroque, ballads and black magic ambience. Its ever-morphing sculptures are a treat.Don’t look for songs. Don’t look for structure. Just let it fill you up, like smoke from an encroaching blaze. Jeez, step away from that metaphor, staircase guy.Scroll all of the best 2018 electronic albums by clicking here.14 – Daniel Avery – Song For Alpha (Phantasy Sound)Daniel Avery makes his music in a shipping container next to the Thames river. It’s a bit like series two of The Wire, but less unionised. Ah. The Wire. I really must watch that again.Apologies – I’m getting nostalgic. Which is kinda relevant, because Avery’s second album Song For Alpha evokes classic Aphex Twin and the early days of 1990s dub techno.The undulating acid of Stereo L or the smoky ambience of Citizen // Nowhere takes me straight back to Rephlex or Beyond or Rising High Records – but with a modern twist because every track here is powerful enough to flatten a dancefloor.Whether Avery is smuggling drugs under the noses of the port police while failing to control his ambitious yet volatile drop-out son is unconfirmed.

Here is another selection of the many albums that didn't make the final top 20 – there are some big names here.Warp Records' longest-serving act Nightmares On Wax returned with Shape The Future (Warp Records) for a mainstream take on trip hop spiritualism. Jeff Mills turned in a murder-thriller soundtrack on And Then There Was Light (Axis Records), giving us everything from Detroitian stomping to plaintive Rhodes. And considering its experimentalism, there were plenty of little hooks on Yves Tumor’s Safe In The Hands Of Love (Warp Records).Leon Vynehall finally cracked open a debut album with Nothing Is Still (Ninja Tune), a fascinating ambient reflection on his grandparents. The 81-year-old Jon Hassell evoked strange technological spaces on Listening To Pictures (Pentimento Volume One) (Ndeya). And there was never a dull moment on the box of tricks that was Syclops’s Pink Eye (Bubble Tease Communications) with its pick-and-mix attitude to dance music genres.If you want something more robust, try these three. Blawan produced club thumpers with bite on Wet Will Always Dry (TERNESC). Grime has never sounded so glistening as on Wen’s EPHEM:ERA (Big Dada). And Helena Hauff was as downright dirty, as ever, on Qualm (Ninja Tune) – no, that’s not your speakers distorting.I hope you like these little side-visits as I count down the top 20 best electronic albums of 2018.

Shuffling rhythms, shimmering keys, languid orchestration. There’s proper instruments. People are playing things. Actual things.This album made me feel refined. It made me want to wear a cravat and a pair of spats. Walk down the street with my head held high, saying how-do to gentlemen and dalmations.I didn’t do that. I’m writing this in my pants, snorting some black crumbs I scraped from the furnace end of my oven. Don’t judge me. DON’T JUDGE ME.Scroll all of the best 2018 electronic albums by clicking here.16 – Orbital – Monsters Exist (ACP)Fat Roland, why have you buried your favourite band in the mid-teens when surely Orbital’s new album should be number one?Good question, imaginary interrogator. Nice hat, by the way. On the first few plays, I had Monsters Exist pegged as one of Orbital’s okay-albums, more Blue album than Brown album. Golden Wonder crisps, not Seabrook.But then saw them play much of this album live and had the skins of my ear-drums flailed by a glorious sonic symphony. Suddenly it all made sense. Hoo Hoo Ha Ha is a bit annoying on record, but in the context of a live set, it’s a killer.As evidenced by their lively performances of PHUK on YouTube, perhaps this would have been better as a live set. This is a live album at heart, packaged awkwardly as a studio album. A studio album that hoo-haed its way into my ears much better once I’d been on that front rail at the O2 Apollo.Scroll all of the best 2018 electronic albums by clicking here.Pah! Why hang out with the cool kids who made the final top 20 album list, when you could be here in the kitchen with all the losers that didn't make it?Here is another clutch of almost-rans, headed by an album with highly processed r ‘n’ b vocals, usually a big turn-off for me. Has to be said, though: they worked amazingly on the slow-burning pseudo-grime sounds of Okzharp & Manthe Ribane’s Closer Apart (Hyperdub). On a similar vocal-led tip, I liked Silvia Kastel’s thoughtful “poetry of nothing” on Air Lows (Blackest Ever Black) and I was beguiled by the alienating mechanics and spooooky voices of Lucrecia Dalt unnerving Anticlines (Rvng Intl).Now, I don't touch drugs these days: although I'm partial to the occasional acid house night, my raving days are long behind me. However, I strongly suspect that if I stepped within 50 feet of Thundercat’s Drank (Brainfeeder), I'd pass out on its slow-baked smokiness. I also lit a nostalgic glow-stick in tribute to the rave vocal samples (“you belong to meee”) and staccato-snared battle cries of RP Boo's I'll Tell You What! (Planet Mu) – he was on brilliantly creative form.Love poems, YouTube videos and Danish graffiti inspired the wide complexity of Varg’s Nordic Flora Pt. 5: Crush (Posh Isolation). And, if you think about it, failure inspired Soulwax's latest album, because instead of coming up with an Essential Mix for Radio 1, they produced Essential (Deewee) instead. It was rough around the edges, but fun nonetheless. And finally, if sounds were colours, Lotic’s Power (Tri Angle) would be an endless tangle of rainbows as seen through a thousand Insta filters.

His sound is still as dark as I remember, sitting somewhere between early Autechre and a Boards Of Canada sent to bed without any supper.That said, it’s superbly melodic in a grumpy Skam Records way – listen to that crunchy chord under the slo-mo scratches of VTOL or the dreamy Global Communication melodic drift of Airlock.Apparently, the voice muttering in Airlock is a sample from the movie Westworld, Michael Crichton's mash-up of old westerns and science fiction. This is more the latter – science fiction played out by morphined androids under an all-too-blistering distant sun.Co Intel Pro by S>>DScroll all of the best 2018 electronic albums by clicking here.18 – Surgeon – Luminosity Device (Dynamic Tension)Brummie beatsmith Surgeon once recorded an album in the Maui jungle, which can be found by popping across North America then veering left until you get to the middle of the ocean.Luminosity Device has all the hallmarks of Surgeon: throbbing techno machinery best listened to in a basement club in Glasgow, or under your duvet flashing your torch like a strobe.And yet, this slow-build of an album takes it cue from the Tibetan Book Of The Dead, a nod to artistry that probably explains the twinkling sparkles of Courage To Face Up To or the haunting vocal chords of The Vibratory Waves Of External Unity.It’s a dark, dirty yet refreshing addition to this veteran techno-head’s catalogue. And he didn’t even have to plug his Ableton into a banyan tree..Scroll all of the best 2018 electronic albums by clicking here.Hey, reader. As the top 20 best albums of 2018 chug on like a happy little tractor, let's pull into this lay-by and have a look at some of the ambient albums that didn't make the list.It was a stonking year for ambient music, so it's no huge surprise that I'd forgotten The Orb had an album this year. Their 15th long-player No Sounds Are Out Of Bounds (Cooking Vinyl) was a mixed affair, but Pillow Fight @ Shag Mountain had Jah Wobble on bass and saw them at their Blue Room best. Meanwhile, just missing out on a top 20 place was Pariah, who swapped muscular bass music for swirling ambience on Here From Where We Are (Houndstooth) – all twinkling with hope and dignity.Laurel Halo's Raw Silk Uncut Wood (Latency) boiled down her work to simplistic melodies rolled across a shallow mist of textures, while there was true serenity to be found in Khotin’s Beautiful You (self-released), its pastoral simplicity an ambient highlight of 2018. And there was more than a little twinkle in the, er, album eye of H Takahashi's Low Power (White Paddy Mountain).Those people that sniff at modern music saying “that’s just noise” clearly haven’t heard Metasplice’s Mirvariates (The Trilogy Tapes), the duo really giving us a lot of different noises. Dronist Tim Hecker employed a Japanese gagaku ensemble for Konoyo (Kranky), not that you’d recognise them when reduced to this level of shredded brokenness. And Ilpo Väisänen, under his moniker as I-LP-ON, paid tribute to his musical partner Mika Vainio on the minimal and statically charged ÄÄNET (Editions Mego): he took sound snippets from an old world tour with Mika and turned them into something remarkable.Raw Silk Uncut Wood by Laurel HaloScroll all of the best 2018 electronic albums by clicking here.19 – Hieroglyphic Being – The Red Notes (Soul Jazz Records)Meet Jamal Moss, a former gigolo sex-pot who now reserves his tweaking fingers for Linn drum machines and Hammond organs. Hur hur. Organs. Sorry.Moss is hugely prolific. In the time it has taken you to get to this sentence, he has probably released 92 albums. With such a generous issue, er, um, try that again… With such a generous output, how can anything, ahem, rise to the surface? Oh crumbs.The answer is: like this. The Red Notes takes Chicago house as its base and spins off into a hypnotic odyssey that is as much techno as it is jazz. Examples: the alternating bass drum of The Seduction Syndrome; the strangled synth solo of The Emotional Listener.This is wild and free and, yes, sexy. A suitable entry, arf, into Chicago house music for techno virgins. I am so, so sorry.Scroll all of the best 2018 electronic albums by clicking here."},

That doesn't mean I don't value them. It's a nice bin, with little frills around the edge.This count-down will be peppered with little summaries of the dozens of albums that didn't make the final list. That includes compilations and rereleases, which I have excluded for simplicity.So before we kick off the top 20 proper, here are some also-rans.There's no space for hardcore getting dirty on the reissued broken breakcore of Christoph De Babalon’s overlooked 1997 album If You're Into It, I'm Out Of It (Cross Fade Enter Tainment) or the experimental South American drumism of Suba’s early-90s work Wayang (Offen Music). Nor did I include Time To Tell (Conspiracy International), a reissue from Throbbing Gristle’s Cosey Fanni Tutti which was a more interesting album than suggested its inspiration suggests – namely, a lecture at Leeds Polytechnic.I also didn't include Takecha’s ear-tickling skeletal house retrospective Deep Soundscapes (Love Potion) was a real ear-tickler, the wonderfully familiar IDMisms on the unearthed Challenge Me Foolish (Planet Mu) by µ-Ziq, the messy joy of the superb compilation Don't Mess With Cupid, 'Cause Cupid Ain't Stupid (трип) or the expanded box-set reissue of Move D’s 1995 techno album Kunststoff –  if the name rings a bell, he was on Volume Four of the Trance Europe Express series.I also tried to keep my list as techno / IDM as possible, because that's what rings my electronic bell. So not much room for hip hop or jazz, with a couple of notable exceptions. And, to my shame, I excluded two classical behemoths. Firstly, Nils Frahm’s All Melody (Warp Records), which was delicate, like a unicorn made of snowflakes, if it was armed with a piano in each hoof. And Jóhann Jóhannsson’s Englabörn & Variations (Deutsche Grammophon), which was overflowing with melancholic elegance like bins wot ain't getting collected until some time after the new year.Challenge Me Foolish by µ-ZiqScroll all of the best 2018 electronic albums by clicking here.Don your flashing trousers and grease your moustache with guacamole - it's time for the best electronic albums of 2018!Other websites and magazines have already published their 2018 retrospectives, including my beloved Electronic Sound.

{"title": "Google autocomplete taught me some important things about electronic music", "date": "Dec 14, 2018", "text": "I had a mild brain fart the other day and forgot everything I had known about electronic music. Thankfully, Google was there to educate me.I began to enter things into its search box, and Google helpfully completed my sentence for me. For example:Turns out Aphex Twin might be Irish or a genius. There's a fine line between the two. I learnt he might be in a Die Antwoord video and possibly uses a Digital Audio Workstation. I'm learning fast here.According to this, Daft Punk might be French androids or bespectacled Scots. There seems to be some uncertainty as to whether they're still making music, or indeed still alive. It's sweet that people think they might be married because they wear matching helmets.A fair bit of homophobia on display here. What even is \"gay music\"? Still, at least I learned that Depeche Mode were goths. Or emo. Or new wave. This really isn't helping. Let's move on.I widened out my search and decided to learn about electronic music. It left me worried for my brain but encouraged about my studies. A supplementary Google search sent me to a forum thread in which someone declared music to be prohibited by Islam. Someone replied with something along the lines of 'but what about all the Muslim musicians?' It didn't get a response.Surely I can learn about rave from Google autocomplete? The results were vague. Rave might not be a word, and may get you in trouble in India. What the heck's rave hairspray and rave tobacco? Is that what all the kids are into these days?Back to the bands, and my all-time favourite. Although only one of these suggested searches references the actual band Orbital. Due to sporadic break-ups, it seems their star has waned. When I turn up to their gig in December, I'm either going to be faced by the world's best techno band or a scuffed old DIY tool. Whatever journey their career is on, they seem to be travelling in a very strange elevator.One more try. How about one of the biggest names in dance music? Surely I can dig up something on Calvin Harris.Is that it?

While that music oozes all over my ear drums, I’m going to tell you about my stupidly busy week.I had that Robin Ince doing a gig at my venue last Tuesday, after which I tootled over to see some good comedy at XS Malarkey. On Wednesday, I co-hosted the last Bad Language of the year, with poet Shirley May on great form. Thursday was covered in my last blog post, so go and read that for a bit. Friday was a necessary night in, even though a friend had a really good show I wanted to see.Saturday afternoon saw me doing improv with Tony Slattery: an unexpected treat with a very talented chap, and you should book his new show if you are the sort of person who books shows. Then on Saturday evening, I went to a superbly funny Group Therapy comedy night, the highlights of which were seeing Glenn Wool for the first time, and seeing John Luke Roberts run through the 24 Spice Girls that didn’t make it into the Spice Girls.On Sunday night, I scratched my pop itch by screaming at Years & Years (pictured). It was loud, proud and more colourful than a pair of jolly colourful slacks from Mrs Thribble-Smythe’s tie-dye trouser boutique. Then on Monday night, I “interpreted” a section of the film Shrek at Flim Nite, which led to the following tweet:Thanks for having me, @flimnite. I should clarify to the audience: that was meant to be Shrek's decapitated head in the box, but I muddied the waters by sticking my finger in his blood and saying it tasted like Donkey.

They were like Instagram, but you wrote the caption on the other side of the picture.Last night, Manchester architects Levitt Bernstein held a postcard auction in aid of Shelter. Designers of the arty cards included New Order, Karl Hyde, Mr Scruff and Mary Anne Hobbs. One of my own designs went under the hammer too. It fetched £45, which wasn't bad for a sketchy pen scrawl. Some of them went for £200, which is £1.29 per centimetre.The auctioneer was the comedian, actor and Manchester celebrity John Thomson. He took the mick beautifully out of the designs (“looks like Johnny Vegas, he said if mine), and bled our pockets dry with a twinkle in his eye. Actually, I didn't win a single auction on the night, so it turned out pretty cheap for me. I went in steep for the Mr Scruff postcard, but I was easily outbid. Shelter, a donation is on the way."},

Suddenly, a family appears with an Alsatian the size of the moon, heading towards us. I set off into the passageway and the cat, nervous, follows. So I'm walking down this passage, the cat walking close with me but looking frantically for a bit of broken fence to escape through as megadog quite cheerily tails us. And suddenly, there's a moment. The cat clocks the length of the inescapable passageway. It's heading too far from home. It's trapped. It looks up at me and lets out a frightened mew. Therefore I did what a lot of cats hate. I scooped up the cat into my arms and stood aside as the humongous hound passes us. The cat buries its face but knows I'm protecting it. Dog gone, the cat shoots back to the start of the passage, back home to safety. (Had a nice chat with the dog owners as they passed, about how their fifty-foot lump of a dog REALLY likes chasing cats.)

I get to put events on in an idiosyncratic but beautiful Manchester mill, and know that whenever someone buys a book about ultraviolence (A Clockwork Orange) or a poet sitting on a toilet (Inside Mr Enderby), they're paying my wage.I'm also immersed in the world of an extraordinary person. Every time I flit from writing a short story to making music to scribbling a strange new cartoon, I think of Burgess. He did the same, mixing his artistic modes like a cocktail: the musical doodles on his manuscripts in our archive are testament to that.You should come and visit my place. There's loads on: as I write, there's a synthesiser gig on, and tomorrow there's a hypnotist, and then there's exhibitions and literature and I'm pretty sure there's a children's concert coming up next month.Working at the Burgess has also freed me up for performance stuff, and I've just had the most remarkable year - bigger and better gigs than ever before including a show run in a proper theatre. Like, proper. It had walls and everything.And to put the journalistic cherry on top of the orange-flavoured cake, the latest Electronic Sound is dedicated to A Clockwork Orange. I've now written 47 columns for ES along with a stack of features and reviews. You really should subscribe. Burgess was a journalist too, of course. He seems determined to copy everything I do.As for the rest of 2018, I'm winding down performance stuff. Smaller gigs, open mics and suchlike. I need more head-space, and some quiet creativity to top off what has been a very loud year. And then in 2019? Bigger, better, louder, stupider, and a more orangey artistic cocktail. What does that even mean? I have no idea.I'll leave you with something cool I did with our brickwork recently. See? Idiosyncratic but beautiful.

On a related note, Orbital are back with a track called PHUK (see video below).According to this interview with Consequence of Sound, PHUK is about:> bankers> demons> Brexit> empire> ammunition tunnels> the 1990s> middle age> veganism> inclusivity> trousersI may have made that last one up, although I'm pretty sure PHUK stands for \"Paul Hartnoll, Underpants Killer.\"Their new album Monsters Exist is out in mid-September.

Yeah, have you got a spare jack to XLR lead, we've run out. Oh and Ableton Push. Just leave it outside the door.\"The result is an EP that doesn't much feel like a continuation of Underworld's previous album Barbara Barbara, We Face a Shining Future.Instead it feels more the kind of ephemeral collaboration you got in the mid 90s, when Begbie first chucked his pint glass off a balcony. When Iggy Pop or Lou Reed or even flipping Pavarotti turned up in other people's stuff.In other words, odd, awkward, not cool, but kinda charming.My favourite on the EP is Trapped. It feels like Johnny Cash trying his hand at disco, if it was mixed by Fluke. Jump over to YouTube for a listen.I can only hope there'll be more bleepy stars giving ageing singers a chance. Skrillex and Dolly Parton. Orbital and Vera Lynn. Autechre and the Keyboard Cat meme  I know that last one doesn't fit the joke - I just really want to see Autechre perform with Keyboard Cat"},
{"title": "BlueDotBlog: Love is all", "date": "Jul 23, 2018", "text": "On my final day at the BlueDot festival, I checked out a couple of science talks. By which to say, I sat snoozing and caught occasional words like \"protozoa\" and \"pulsars\".Actually, Jodrell Bank's astronomer Tim O'Brien gave a great talk about sounds from space. He once bounced Stephen Hawking off the moon, using our lunar partner as a giant delay pedal for the scientist's voice. It was, as astrophysicists would say, well good.I caught tiny bits of Warm Digits, Crazy P or Little Dragon, but the Sunday will be remembered for three particular music highlights. I'm going to rank them in order, like Top of the Pops. This is Top of the Bands that Played BlueDot on the Sunday...At number three, if you can get through the cloak of weed shrouding the tent, it's The Orb. Alex and his chums dug into his ever-pulsating back catalogue, and I'm glad he appended his Little Fluffy Clouds remix with a big chunk of the original. Tuuune.Straight in at number two is Vessels. You can still hear the beating post-rock heart in their rollercoaster climbs and swoops, their techno electrified by the inclusion of a live drummer. I'm going to be playing Vessels a lot this next week.Still at number one, because they've always been there if you're honest about it, it's the Chemical Brothers. Tune after tune after tune, eye-smooshing visuals from start to finish, and a five-minute cameo from robots with laser eyes. Stupidly entertaining. I think that's everything. Oh yeah, I finished the festival seeing Rob Kemp's The Elvis Dead where he reimagines Evil Dead 2 through Elvis Presley songs. Not seen the film, not bothered about Elvis, but crikes it was funny. And an utterly surreal place to be when you're sitting in the front row still sweating from the Chemicals ten minutes previously.This year, BlueDot lit a rocket under their line-up and sent us all to somewhere cosmic. It's an experience like no other, the Lovell telescope's constant presence connecting us all to something more important than wristband checks, portable toilets and chafed feet. \"Love is all\" said the Chemical Brothers' final graphic, and that pretty much sums up BlueDot, the nicest, friendliest festival in the UK."},

They say they'll call, but they never do.I saw The Long Now, an Eno-inspired soundscape project by Finnur Bjarnason and Richard Norris, aka the bloke from The Grid, and a bit of Hookworms too. Has to be said, I wasn't overly fussed about catching Gary Numan, and instead found myself quivering to the whiplash wit of comedian Josh Jones. Love that guy.I watched my writer chum David Hartley perform a rare feat of making two fifteen-minute stories thoroughly engaging. I'm actually camping with Dave, and if I'm not nice about his writing, he'll poke me in the eye with a tent peg. (Seriously though, thanks for the camping company, Hannah, Dave and Debs.)My dirty techno fix came courtesy of Ralph Lawson and Helena Hauff's excellent inner city electronic takeover. I was equally baffled and impressed at the modular mock-Erasure music of Look Mum No Computer.I have two bestest highlights yesterday. Lamb's showstopping Gorecki, a perfect example of how to overcome technical problems - they had to stop the show at one point - and go on to bring the house down. And Future Islands, whose feather-light synth pop seems to feed singer Sam with all kinds of demons. My favourite move of his is the sideways bowling ball. Try it sometime.That's all for yesterday's BlueDot fun. No pictures this time because I'm trying to save battery. More tomorrow - I really need to tell you about the man whose hat was on fire."},

However, it's one blog post you're getting today, so you'll have to make do. Do you think I'm MADE of blog posts?!I went to a talk about Jodrell Bank's Lovell telescope. You'll know the white lattice dish from the mock-up fictional version that killed off Tom Baker in Doctor Who. Apparently if it snows heavily, they tilt the dish to make an avalanche. I realise it's July, but I'm willing to sit here and wait for that to happen.I caught Pop-Up Cinema's Flash Gordon. They do frenetic puppet show remakes of classic films. Imagine Alfred Hitchcock doing Punch & Judy on a runaway train. Flash (pictured above) was a delight.I have two absolute highlights of the day. Mad Professor plumbed the depths of dub with cheery playfulness, ripping up Stevie Wonder and, er, Robin S with delay turned up to 11. And a solo Roni Size beamed his way through a bass-shredding drum 'n' bass set that reprazented (geddit?!) the earliest and latest elements of his career.I enjoyed the Rajasthan Heritage Brass Band with all their Bollywood sass, and I was wowed by a fire-breathing puppet parade.Brian Eno collaborator Tom Rogerson kicked up an ambient storm, while Afrodeutsche and Not Waving cranked up enough techno to bring the rain clouds in.I saw Alexis from Hot Chip, which I quite enjoyed. I liked his cheese hat. I didn't really connect with Public Service Broadcasting. And the Flaming Lips were every bit as rambling, wild and immersive as I'd come to expect. Wayne had a special message for us in balloons (below). You can figure out the full text. Amazing.I met old friends and made new friends, and had a pretty neat katzu curry. I told you this was way too much for one post. Phew.More tomorrow."},

It's barely breakfast time and I can already hear someone in a nearby tent taking about hydrogen fusion.Or something. I'm not very sciencey.BlueDot started in spectacular fashion. The Halle Orchestra blasted out some grand classical music to the sights - and sounds - of the Blue Planet telly programmeI can now say I've seen killer whales battering sealions to death to the glorious swells of an orchestra. They even did a Christmas melody set to the crazy antics of polar bears and penguins.For personal reasons, it was especially pleasing to see the Halle pull this off. I sang with them as a founder member of the Manchester Boys Choir. I am that sealion, squealing in whale-walloped harmony with that astonishing collective. A highlight of BlueDot is the eerie art that haunts the woods at night. I love the massive suspended globe, surrounded by the sounds of everyone on the planet chattering away in an Underworld-style stream of consciousness. It glows in the dark - you'll have to make do with a daytime picture for now. More BlueDot today. Hope I get to fuse some hydrogen."},

I found it on the floor.I don't think Fatboy Slim would have been impressed with my sculpture. The embedded fag ends and dead spiders made it pretty horrible to look at. And also it was fifty foot tall, and I think it would have made the real Fatboy jealous of the fake Fatboy.Sometimes it's best to leave the original thing alone. The world would be a lot better with one American Pie, one version of the Sugababes, just one of the Jedwards. As it is, people insist on trying to \"improve\" things until everything that is \"good\" falls into a \"burning pit of sadness\".In an entirely unconnected note, here's a remix of one of my short stories. AHEM. A while back, I wrote a tale called Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey about a person pressing a button in a factory. This is a mocking blog post, but I couldn't be more pleased with this stellar work by Rickerly and David Hartley for The Hillside Curation. Seriously, it's damn good - more literature should be like this (assuming you can call my stream-of-consciousness \"literature\"). It kind of made me whoop with delight. Check out the Jack Nicholls and Ada Hoffmann pieces too.The episodes are all named after a cluster of streets from the curators' home town.

{"title": "The doctor (Adamski) will see you now", "date": "Jun 1, 2018", "text": "Doctor Adamski's Musical Pharmacy was the 1990 debut album from Adam 'Adamski' Tinley. (Not an actual pharmacist.) I seem to remember Smash Hits calling him a keyboard wizard. (Not an actual wizard.)I first got into Adamski when he released the fizzy NRG,  a Lucozade burst of squelchy rave. So when he got to the top of the charts with Killer, a tune I was obsessed with, it seemed the keyboard wizard was working his wand overtime. Wait. Not an actual wizard. I keep forgetting.Doctor Adamski's Musical Pharmacy was the first big rave album I owned, but it was before folks like Orbital and the Prodigy showed us how excel at making dance music albums. I wanted a sweaty club experience but the clubbier elements were squeezed out by what felt like extended jokes. Tinley doing an Elvis impression. Reciting the alphabet (\"E is for electro, and that's quite serious\"). Adam's strained punk singing.Then again... Listen to the choppy bassline of Eighth House. The Detroity surf of Squiggy Groove. There's a whole heap of rave sensibility still in there, and the naive sound of his bedroom keyboard set-up is utterly charming. Despite its flaws, I was fond of the album and the 17-year-old me played it loads.The Pharmacy shut up shop pretty quickly. The album only spent five weeks in the charts, compared to, say, 25 weeks that year by fellow chart-toppers Snap. It doesn't even have any reviews on Discogs. Adamski has been active this century as Adam Sky, plonking out sparky house music and dirty punk electro. Forever the keyboard wizard - just not necessarily remembered as a pharmacist."},

{"title": "A whole Seven Inches of reflections", "date": "May 27, 2018", "text": "I did a theatre show. I did a big thing on a stage and, amazingly, people came.After two Edinburgh Fringe shows and a stack of spoken word / comedy performances, it was great to expand my own brand of cartoon stupidity to a larger stage. My third show Seven Inch was a surreal and silly story about a failed record shop, which happened to be a 3D cartoon. The four performances, commissioned by The Lowry, were part of their Week 53 festival for the creatively curious.What an absolute joy it was. 160 people on the opening night, a five star review, and a riotous closing performance on Friday in which I lost my temper at the audience. All acting of course - in real life, I have the temper of a ketamined sloth on holiday.It was also a fantastically rewarding experience to collaborate with proper clever theatre people, especially stage manager Mark Croasdale who, I suspect, is an actual angel. Next time I meet him, I'll check for wings.I'm not quite sure I can process how big of an experience this was just yet. I'm writing this in bed by yapping into my phone. Maybe I just need some sleep, and to get my blogging and social life back. A touch of normality, and some space to reflect. Then what? It would be great to go on tour with my little record shop show. For now, though... to bed."},

Here's a bit of an update. I'm aware I've been too busy to blog about music (catch my Twitter feed if you want to hear more from me, or read my column in Electronic Sound), so I'll pepper this news with Vague Music Thoughts (VMTs).I've mostly been prepping for my show at The Lowry, which is fast approaching so you'd best bag tickets quickly. I've added a couple of extra dates, so you've no excuse to miss it. Unless you're a million miles away. Or in another dimension. Or a dog and therefore have no concept of theatre shows. Here's me in my performance space...VMT: The Prodigy's Music For A Jilted Generation is a cracking album. I know the one after that got all the plaudits and number one singles, but cor, it's a belter.I compered a scratch show at Waterside in Sale, in which thesps try out new ideas on a crowd. Nights like this are always wonderfully messy, and if compered right, a real joy for the audience. Plenty of new faces too at Bad Language - packed as usual, with the brilliant Deanna Rodger headlining.VMT: Boards of Canada's Music Has The Right To Children turned 20 this month. One of those albums I remember hearing for the first time. Those detuned chords. So good.I popped to the Lake District to perform at Verbalise. Lovely crowd, and I spent some time scuttling through the Serpentine woods looking for adventures. I found a massive caterpillar so I ran away.VMT: Have a listen to Jon Hopkins' new stuff. Emerald Rush is all dirty and squishy and uplifting. I'll embed it below.Finally, I have a track on a compilation album. There's a robot-themed CD with the latest Electronic Sound, and you can find my Hounds of Hulme track Rise Of The Dead Robots alongside Devo, Meat Beat Manifesto and John Foxx. This is quite a big thing, really, so I should have led with this. Ah well. Too late now. Have some Jon Hopkins...VMT: Music's good, innit."},

{"title": "What can we learn from Eric Morecambe's paper bag trick?", "date": "Apr 5, 2018", "text": "We all know Eric Morecambe was a special talent, and his partnership with Ernie Wise is pretty much universally acclaimed. The glasses waggle. The stripper song at breakfast. The speeding 'ice cream van'. All the right notes, not necessarily in the right order.But when analysing the depth of someone's performance skill, I don't think the big routines are enough. As with Les Dawson's tiny glances off camera, Morecambe made the best of his talent in the small stuff.Take his paper bag routine, as seen in this video. Skip past the David Frost stuff and watch Morecambe and Wise on stage in Croydon.Eric's laughing at Ernie's song. Some ad-libbing about Eric's wig. Earnest carries on in, er, earnest as Eric gets out the paper bag. The audience is laughing because they've seen it before. It's a signature Eric prop. Eric begins to catch the imaginary ball, as the ever-straight Ernie presses on with the \"singing, folks\".Then comes the twist: Ernie grabs the bag, and of course, he fails to replicate the trick. And then a lovely bit of audience interaction which gifts Ernie the funniest set-up line of the routine, where the bag itself becomes a pun.But hold on. Rewind. We've skipped my favourite bit. It's a part of the routine that lasts ten whole seconds, but you wouldn't notice it because the Sooty line distracted you.After Eric laughs at the Sooty line, he decides to get out his trusty paper bag. He's half-ignoring his partner as his attention wanders. The paper bag will liven things up, he thinks. Eric then reaches into the wrong pocket. Eric then reaches into the wrong pocket.Morecambe knows exactly which pocket the paper bag is in - watch him retrieve it with ease back in the Frost studio. Yet he has the confidence to bumble clumsily for the bag while the routine picks up pace. This is the same Eric who trips over nothing, who flinches at imaginary goosings, who second-guesses everything for that extra laugh. It's the same Eric who asks Ernie to move along the sofa, then sits on the chair instead. An inexhaustible supply of sleights.His deliberate mistake elevates his performance into something that's deeper than the big-hitting gags and comedic face slaps. Every time I watch that routine, I'm so grateful for the moment of Cooper-esque humanity. If Eric can make an error, albeit very small, then I'm okay too.Except it's not an error. It's pure professional dexterity that keeps the audience hooked. All performers can learn from this. What extra can you do between the things that are there to be noticed? What can add a pleasing ripple as we go from A to B?All the right moves, exactly in the right order."},

I started it with jury service.At 9am on Tuesday 2nd January, I found myself in court trying to look as suspicious as possible so I'd get let off. Even with the stripy jumper, eye mask and teetering swag bag, they still made my do jury duty.On the positive side, they were VERY impressed with the barrel roll I did when entering the court room. \"Cool moves, dude, quack\" said the judge who also happened to be a six foot duck. It helped that the made the guilty people dress as as Hamburglar.On a slightly less stupid note, I found jury service fascinating. I got to sit on a trial, and even managed to be foreperson of the jury. After all, why would you pass up the chance to be the bloke who reads out the verdict? Dead exciting, right?Parts of it were tough. We were faced with a split jury, with most of us leaning towards a legally correct but morally unpleasant verdict. Announcing the decision in court felt like dropping an incendiary bomb into the lives of real people. But I did my job well, as did all of my fellow jurors, and during deliberation I managed to lead a group of people through a field of decisional cowpats without getting poo everywhere. The final result was as follows:guilty 3, innocent 1adjourned 0, dismissed 2robes 1, wigs 0 (late result) guv'nors 1, m'luds 1 (5,4 pen.)If you're facing the prospect of jury service, my guidance is simple: research your role and do it well, keep a logical head, make friends, bring a pack of cards, don't continuously moan about taxpayer money, get fresh air when you can, and don't expect wifi. Oh and judges rule. Even the one in my cartoon."},
{"title": "Remember when Boards of Canada remixed Colonel Abrams?", "date": "Jan 13, 2018", "text": "Before they released their amazing Music Has The Right To Children debut album, Boards of Canada produced some odd remixes.Firstly, here's BoC taking on Colonel Abrams' 1985 hit Trapped. I'm a big fan of the Boards, but this is kinda horrible.Secondly, here's an alternative take on Trapped. The original song is almost incidental as Boards get all Autechre on us. In fact, it's so Autechre-y, it doesn't sound much like BoC at all.On this third remix, they get it right. This time they're taking on Midnight Star's 1986 song The Midas Touch, a minor hit in the States but a top ten hit over here in the UK. The BoC beats are upfront and centre, as is the original track. The dour electronic workout juxtaposes nicely with the glittery video.I can forgive all this not quite working: they were unofficial remixes under the alias Hell Interface.Incidentally, the Hell Interface alias appeared again on a 1997 Christmas compilation called Whine And Missingtoe, with a spooky track called Soylent Night. If BoC were the Whine, then V/vm Records' James Kirkby was the Missingtoe: for the album, he produced a terrifying Chipmunk version of Hark The Herald Angels Sing and a truly Satanic version of Jingle Bells called A Sprig Of Holly On The Electric Turbine.

July or something.I spent a bit of time today researching UK number one singles that are bona fide New Year's Day chart toppers: in other words, they reached number one the week *after* Christmas, replacing whatever was official Christmas number one. A new New Year number one, if you like.There aren't many.1955: Dickie Valentine With The Stargazers - Finger of Suspicion1956: Bill Haley & His Comets - Rock Around The Clock1957: Guy Mitchell - Singing The Blues1963: Cliff Richard & The Shadows - The Next Time / Bachelor Boy1969: Marmalade - Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da1979: Village People - YMCA1989: Kylie Minogue & Jason Donovan - Especially For You1991: Iron Maiden - Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter1999: Chef - Chocolate Salty Balls (PS I Love You)2010: Joe McElderry - The Climb2012: Coldplay - Paradise2014: Pharrell Williams - Happy2015: Mark Ronson ft Bruno Mars - Uptown Funk2016: Justin Bieber - Love YourselfConsidering it's a quiet time of year for record sales, there are some pretty massive hits in that list. More so than if you chose a random week later in the year, I'd say.The current UK number one is an Ed Sheeran track that was number one for Christmas last week. So no new New Year number one this year: nothing to add to the list.However, if this list was based on streams only, today would have a brand new New Year number one. Hurray! What's the song? Last Christmas by Wham.Oh great. Even New Year can't totally get rid of Christmas."},
{"title": "Best electronic albums of 2017: joint number one", "date": "Dec 31, 2017", "text": "1 – Clark – Death Peak (Warp Records)1 – Jlin – Jlin – Black Origami (Planet Mu)Two things to say right off the bat. Firstly, I missed out doing a number two because that's what you're meant to do when you have two big number ones. Secondly, it's such a cop-out to have two joint winners of album of the year.Let me explain. It's a head / heart thing, and no two albums summed up that tension more than the two I'm presenting here.Jlin's Black Origami is a perfect expression of percussion, where all the fury and fire of 2017 has been propelled into a clinically devastating work. You know you're in a different world altogether when you have a child saying into your headphones, \"you’re all going to die down here\" and for a moment, you believe it.This album may be abrasive on first listen, but let the beats become the music: let the spikes of sound become waves. That said, this is not an album you feel. It seems to plug itself into you physically - body music full of sub-bass and minimalism. An album for the head that just happens to have rewritten the footwork genre.Meanwhile, Clark's Death Peak twanged my heart trumpet like no other. I've shown plenty of love for Clark before, whether I'm digging up facts about him, awarding him the second best album of 2014, or the best album of 2009. So it's no great surprise to see him here again.The reason is simple: Death Peak was the one album throughout 2017 I returned to again and again. I played it to pieces. I couldn't escape the \"buzzing arpeggios, ambient fogs, analogue snarls\", as I said in my review for Electronic Sound. And, like Jlin, more terrifying children, this time in the form of a choir singing \"we are your ancestors\". I'm beginning to think that this Clark album, in equal parts baleful and hopeful, is his most complete yet: an emotive journey from start to finish.Jlin for the head. Clark for the heart.It's much better having two at the top. Yin and yang. Sweet and sour. Shock and awe. Ant and Dec. Little and Large. Mitchell and Webb. Morecambe and-- wait, hold on, I'm just naming comedy duos now.Thanks for reading my blog in 2017. With the help of today, this year I've totalled 165 blog posts, which means it's my most blogged year ever. Views range from a couple of hillbillies and their can of beans to hundreds of salivating music addicts, and just this week I've had over a thousand clicks for an old blog post about Autechre. Probably a bot. Every reader is huuugely appreciated, so thank you.Hur hur. Bot. Sounds like bottom.Sigh. See you in 2018.Black Origami by JlinScroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.You have been so patient waiting for me to parp out this long list. We're nearly there. In fact, I can reveal that this year's NUMBER ONE BESTEST ALBUM is a joint number one. It'll be the first time the top spot has been shared since Andy Stott and Lone split the accolade in 2012.Before we get there, here are some big and big-ish names that didn't make my list.Perhaps Sampha's soul is too straight-up to be considered for inclusion here, but the instrumentation on the Mercury-winning Process (Young Turks) was top notch. I also fell for the alluring ethereal pop on Colleen's A Flame My Love, A Frequency (Thrill Jockey). I was perhaps less personally taken with the prog tendencies of James Holden & The Animal Spirits' The Animal Spirits although it's clearly a very good album indeed.Mount Kimbie surprised me (pleasantly) with the post-punk vibes of Love What Survives (Warp Records). Vintage synth fans take note. I found Clap! Clap!'s A Thousand Skies (Black Acre) in some ways exhausting, but then again that album is a spaceship ride, not a Sunday drive. And I doff my hat to Fever Ray's Plunge (Rabid Records), a trip for fans of quirky pop and big fat keyboards.Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith got plenty of accolades this year for her new-agey The Kid (Western Vinyl) vocal-led, as did Kelela on the astonishing debut album Take Me Apart (Warp Records). Both albums are worth your time, particularly if vocal-led albums tickle your tassels. And finally for this section, maybe start your 2018 resting in the hot dappled glow of lackadaisical sounds on Laurel Halo's Dust (Hyperdub).A flame my love, a frequency by ColleenScroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.3 – Errorsmith – Superlative Fatigue (PAN)Remember the dirty filters Daft Punk used on their debut album Homework? They went biddidy-dow biddidy-dwow baddidy-pyow boddidy-pyooo, and so on.Superlative Fatigue is full of those kind of filters. They are the best filters ever. There's something so fat and dirty about Errorsmith's first album in 13 years - everything is banged up to the most bangiest bang ever. If I was dancing to this, it would be the best dancefloor ever. There's acid and trap and techno and house and the BEST MUSIC EVER.Those superlatives getting on your nerves, yeah? Funny, that.Every fart and every pow is a treat on this album. The filtered gasping vocal on My Party is all kinds of stupid, title track Superlative Fatigue is an absolute tune piped through a tonne of scaffolding, and Retired Low-level Internal Server sounds like, well, an old bit of computer kit on its way out... but with more heart.An album which came late in the year, but thank goodness it did.Superlative Fatigue by ErrorsmithScroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.4 – Shinichi Atobe – From The Heart, It's A Start, A Work Of Art (DDS) Give me eggs, flower and fairy dust, and I'll bake you a cake. You may want to spit it into the bin, but it will contain all the right ingredients. Even if the end result was lacking, it is a cake.Cakes contain fairy dust, right?Give me the ingredients to produce house music, and I might produce something okay given the right YouTube instructional videos and Ableton training sessions. Those that have heard my 2012 recorded output may argue that....However, some people can take basic ingredients and make something amazing.I present to you the simple dubby house rhythms of From The Heart, It's A Start, A Work Of Art. Atobe is a Japanese producer clouded in mystery, but I would love to know why he, say, plonked the snarling air-gun percussion over the terribly sad Republic - it's a stroke of genius.From the glimmering work-out of Regret to the echoing shimmy of closer First Plate 3, this collection of rediscovered old tracks is full of sparkling, driving techno in the vein of Jon Hopkins and Four Tet. It works more slowly - no builds or swoops here - but the result is no less rewarding.I bet Shinichi Atobe uses fairy dust in his cakes. No easy streams to embed, so here's a YouTube rip of Republic. Give it time...Scroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.Let's pause the countdown once more. Here are some tasty techno tidbits which, although worthy of your attention, just didn't make the grade for the final top 20. Consider them as pathetic rejects, but also really brilliant albums wot you should listen to.Here's some Fake news (ha ha): Nathan Fake nearly made it into my final 20 with Providence (Ninja Tune). He seems to have beaten down his writer's block with some impressively chunky synth work. Peverelist's Tessellations (Livity Sound Recordings) matched beefy bass with airy ambience. I definitely detected some Stranger analogue Things in Pye Corner Audio's superb The Spiral (Death Waltz Recording Company) Stranger analogue thingsJust finished thowing shapes and/or having it large? Enjoy some amazing post-club non-bangers in Teengirl Fantasy's 8AM (Planet Mu). Two decades of German techno were represented on Thomas Brinkmann's Retrospektiv (Third Ear Recordings), with it all feeling like an odd basement party withKraftwerk. And Manchester's Modern love label pumped out some staggering, paranoid techno on Turinn's 18 1/2 Minute Gaps (Modern Love).Not enough? Then try some moody pounders on 400PPM's Fit for Purpose (Avian), shiny electronic funk on Sinjin Hawke's debut First Opus (Fractal Fantasy). beguiling afro-euro dancehall techno on STILL's ungoogleable I (PAN) or Andrew Weatherall's positively polite Qualia (Hoga Nord).Phew. We're nearly there.Providence by Nathan FakeTessellations by PeverelistScroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.5 – Bicep – Bicep (Ninja Tune)Here it is. The top five best albums of 2017. What shall we start the top five with? Nose-flute ballads from Peru? A compilation of Asda in-store radio jingles? The sound of the universe dying?No, let's have some irresistible prog house in the form of Bicep. Matt McBriar and Andy Ferguson have produce a stormer here. Although covered in a coffee-table sheen, every beat feels urgent, every skipping snare a call to action.Glue should have every Moderat fan mopping their broken heart off the floor. And the filtered ravey chirrups in Rain will have Chicane devotees salivating.Let's not forget where Bicep came from. Producers, yes, DJs, yes. They were music bloggers, which is very much the greatest form of art. In a million years, when the columns of empire have crumbled and humanity is a mere sliver of carbon amid the layers of the earth, they will talk of music bloggers. \"Do you remember Bicep's blog,\" whisper the future aliens. \"Yes, and we remember Fat Roland too.\"THANKS, future beings, thanks.Bicep by BicepScroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.6 – Rhys Celeste– Microlith (Fundamental Records)When I am dead and gone, and my ashes have been loaded into a Casio keyboard and cannoned into the heart of the sun, I'd like to think there'd be a lasting tribute to me. A statue, a bench, a catch of the day at my local fishmongers, anything really.After we lost Rhys Celeste earlier this year, Fundamental Records took his final recording sessions and produced Microlith, named after the Maltese knob-twiddler's pseudonym. That's way better than a statue or a blue plaque or having a piece of Ikea furniture named after you. (*adds that one to the list*)This album is really nicely done. Chattering Roland drum machines splash rhythmic colour throughout, and you're never far away from a puddle of squelchy acid. No frills here - just lashings of lo-fi and buckets of reverb. It has a similar vibe to Aphex Twin's comeback material, but warmer.There is a down side. It looks like this is a vinyl-only release. Actually, this is good news - what a lovely tribute to the music. But it does mean not much digital traction here. Do track it down if you can.Totem pole. I've decided. I want a totem pole. Inside a Tesco Metro.Scroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.The top 20 best electronic albums are progressing nicely, but let's take a break to stuff some more also-rans down your music pipe so you can smoke every last one of them. Here's a hotch-potch of various genres that didn't quite make the cut.I enjoyed getting greased up on the oily, dirty electro on Patricia's Several Shades Of The Same Color (Spectral Sound), while it's worth checking in on Le Car's Auto-Reverse (Clone Classic Cuts) and its old-school claps, blaps and bleeps. Oh and let's not forget Floating Points' sandswept but somewhat noodly Reflections - Mojave Desert (Pluto).Here are some noisy ones for you. Tzusing's 東方不敗 (L.I.E.S.) put the \"angst\" into \"bangers\" if you ignore some of the letters. Emptyset made a load of instruments for Borders (Thrill Jockey) to produce some nicely rasping sound design. And Pharmakon's Contact (Sacred Bones Records) prompted me to open my Electronic Sound review with: \"The hairy wet artwork of Contact will grab your attention way before the screaming begins.\"Definitely make some mp3 space for Biogen's posthumous retrospective Halogen Continues (Trip) and its lovely Icelandic IDM that spins from zaniness to glistening ambience. And James 'Drexciya' Stinson's back catalogue popped out some unreleased work in the form of Jack Peoples' Laptop Cafe (Clone Aqualung Series) - just imagine if IDM-heads took over Radio 2. Also worth a nosey is his classic work as The Other People Place: the reissued Lifestyles Of The Laptop Café (Warp Records) has some great Drexiyan IDM, overlooked first time round.One thing I should mention before I forget: Stinson aside, I've tried to steer clear of reissues, soundtracks and compilations in this end-of-year round-up. I have too much on my list as it is. So apologies to Leftism 22 and Kraftwerk, and to Oneohtrix Point Never, Winged Victory For The Sullen, and the various people who did Fabric and DJ Kicks compilations. SORRY, EVERYONE.東方不敗 by TzusingScroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here."},
{"title": "Best electronic albums of 2017: seven", "date": "Dec 31, 2017", "text": "7 – Brainwaltzera – Poly-ana (Film)Here are some happy memories:> The stop-motion objects moving around the beach in Aphex Twin's On.> The blue lasers during Halcyon at a 1995 Orbital gig.> Walking out of Cruz 101 and finding pilled-up clubbers wowing at the sky.> Playing Autechre's Amber album in a church.> Bossing the levels on Wipeout 2097 to the sound of We Have Explosive.Strange how such small good memories stay with you. Poly-ana appears to be named after the Pollyanna principle, which is our brain's tendency to more accurately recall pleasurable memories rather than unpleasant ones.This debut album from an anonymous producer plays on those memories, for this is a collection of unashamedly nostalgic IDM, albeit on a lower gas mark than usual. You'll hear echoes of Aphex's The Tuss alias, Boards of Canada and, of course, Aphex Twin himself.Actually, to heck with the comparisons. This has been one of the biggest growers of 2017, and works equally well at snoozing-off level as it does blasted to the max. It's stirring memories, sure, but it's also got me proper excited about new music in 2017.Scroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.8 – Talaboman  – The Night Land (R&S Records)Axel Boman and John Talabot come together as Talaboman for this absolute treat on R&S Records.The Night Land could be dismissed as yet another house album on first listen, but listen out for the drones that infect the album throughout, or the occasional electronic stabs that remind you the machines are in charge.Loser's Hymn is one of the best tunes of the year too.In my mind, the people that are enjoying this are ageing ravers forever trapped in a 4/4 beat against an imaginary Ibizan sunset. The builds and break-downs are long gone: all that is left is the pulsating rhythm itself.Or, in another possible universe, this album is proof that Luke Abbott has always been a member of Kraftwerk.The Night Land by TalabomanScroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.As Steve 'Silk' Hurley once said, \"Jack, jack, ja jack jack your body Jack ya, jack, jack ya, jack your body Jack, jack, ja jack jack your body Jack ya, jack, jack ya, jack your body Jack, jack, ja jack jack your body Jack ya, jack, jack ya, jack your body Jack, jack, ja ja jack your body Jack, jack, ja ja jack your body Jack, jack, ja ja jack your body.\"Here are some house music albums that didn't quite reach this year's top 20.Nick Höppner's second album Work (Ostgut Ton) very nearly made my final 20 because it liberally sprinkles its house aesthetic with lashings of intelligent techno. Also worth a nod are the rich armchair instrumentals of Bonobo's Migration (Ninja Tune) and a nicely-chilled debut in the form of adopted Welshman Dauwd's Theory of Colours (Technicolour).Four Tet took a meditative turn on New Energy (Text Records): only he can create fluffy chill-out with such heft. DJ Octo Octa explored the process of transitioning to a new gender with some superior house music on Where Are We Going? (Honey Soundsystem Records). And Fred P gave us some smooth club cuts on FP-Oner's 7 (Mule Musiq).If you're in the mood for some Nordic dub disco, then opt for Bjørn Torske and Prins Thomas's Square One (Smalltown Supersound). DJ Python's debut Dulce Compañia (Incienso) impressed with some almost military reggaeton. And the absolute legend Robert Hood kept things predictably - and pleasingly - minimal on Paradygm Shift (Dekmantel).Migration by BonoboScroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.9 – Arca – Arca (XL)Somewhere on the internet, there is a rough video of pop sensation Justin Bieber hanging out with friends. In the video, he tries - and fails - to sing his international smash hit single Despacito, the biggest Spanish number one single since 'Macarena' (no, really).The problem is, Justin doesn't know any of the Spanish words. This is partly because his hit single is merely a remix, but also because - I suspect - young Mr Biebpipe doesn't think too deeply about the music.Arca is the polar opposite to Justin Bieber. His self-titled album Arca is a Spanish-language antidote to all that is terrible about Despacito. It finds depths the wordless Justin may never know, and spins us from mournful vocals to breakneck drama in a matter of seconds.For those put off by Arca's experimentalism, there's good news. Thanks to the vocals being upfront in his work like never before, this is easily his most accessible album yet. Want to get into Arca? Start here.Let's finish this with some photographs of the guy, followed by a video which contains the following content warnings: strobes and partial ass.Scroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.10 – Blanck Mass – World Eater (Sacred Bones Records)Woah! It's top ten time! And because I'm about to write about Blanck Mass, an act with a stupendously large sound, I am going to write the rest of this bit in capital letters.IF YOU ARE AN EAGLE-EYED READER OF MY WORDS, YOU WILL KNOW THAT BLANCK MASS'S DUMB FLESH WAS MY ALBUM OF THE YEAR IN 2015. MY REVIEW PRAISED ITS GLORIOUS ENERGY, AND OH BOY WHAT ENERGY.THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE GLOBULA GABBA OF NEW ALBUM WORLD EATER (SACRED BONES RECORDS) IS A REAL TREAT. A PERFECT MIX OF FAT POPPY LINES AND ADOLESCENT AGIT-ELECTRO.IT'S PROCESSED TO HECKERY AND I LOVE IT.Tell you something: it's exhausting pressing shift before every letter.World Eater by Blanck MassScroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.There are zillions of techno albums that didn't make my final top 20 list. Here are some also-rans that are well worth your time tracking down.Moiré's No Future (Ghostly International) mixed some heavy bass with some deliciously scratchy sounds - this very nearly made the final 20. I like what I heard in the broken electronics of Herva's Hyper Flux (Planet Mu). Ikonika's third album Distractions (Hyperdub) impressed with her sheer invention melody, while the techno-clad earworms of Legowelt's Legendary Freaks In The Trash Of Time (Clone West Coast Series) brightened up my 2017.A couple of DJ debuts impressed, namely DJ Lycox's first album Sonhos & Pesadelos (Príncipe), which was packed with compelling, rhythmic energy, and DJ Sports' dance genre-spanning pick-and-mix Modern Species (Firecracker). Also worth a mention is the vital machine music of Richard H Kirk's first solo long-player for a while, Dasein (Intone).Is there more? Of course there's more! I liked Dabrye's take on industrial wonkiness as Charles Manier for his album Luxus Steroid Abamita (Bopside Records), and I also liked the humming analogue bleeps from modular composer Caterina Barbieri on Patterns Of Consciousness (ImportantRecords). Finally, for this little section, if you want some EBM for a Detroit generation, look in on Broken English Club's The English Beach (L.I.E.S.).Hyper Flux by HervaScroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.11 – Forest Swords – Compassion (Ninja Tune)Here is a list of weapons I would use while outdoors:> Tree gun> Cloud knife> Beach tazer> Toadstool nunchucks> Squirrel bazooka> Forest swordSee what I did there? Forest Swords' Compassion ought to be rated up there with the likes of Mark Pritchard for an ability to create something utterly widescreen yet organic and heart-breakingly melancholic.Widescreen because of the doom-laden drum on Arms Out, organic because of the way the snare punches through the chopped voices on Exalter, melancholic because of THOSE bass notes on The Highest Flood.Remarkable. If this is only number 11 in my list of best electronic albums of 2017, you'd better stay tuned for the top ten... otherwise I'll shoot you with my babbling brook grenade.Scroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.12 – LCD Soundsystem – American Dream (DFA Records)“Does it make you uncomfortable?” says David Bowie to James Murphy when the latter talks of reforming one of the noughties’ most influential dance outfits; a band that has scored a generation’s first gigs, first drugs, first snogs. “Yeah,” replies Murphy, looking into the eyes of the scrawny duke. “Good – it should,” says Bowie: a blessing to chill the disco shoes of the most seasoned producer.So starts my Electronic Sound review of LCD Soundsystem's latest album American Dream. Want to read the rest of it? Track down issue 33 of the magazine.That's it for this review. No more words. Just a teaser. And you already know whether you like this album or not anyway because, hey, it's LCD flipping Soundsystem.In fact, it's really great. Why is this not in my top ten?

The vocals also shone on Reassemblage (Rvng Intl.) by Visible Cloaks, an immersive and creative trip inspired by a Vietnamese movie. Visible Cloaks had a couple of great label mates this year: Pauline Anna Strom showed off some wibbly woozy synths on Trans-Millenia Music (Rvng Intl) while I liked the twitters and tinks and tonks and gronks of Sugai Ken's UkabazUmorezU (Rvng Intl.).I warmed to the field recordings of Rainforest Spiritual Enslavement's Ambient Black Magic (Hospital Productions), which is probably more techno than ambient, but whatevz.

I asked her if she ever got lonely. Her reply was something along the lines of having to break herself down at the end of every day so she could start the following day rebuilding herself afresh.The reply impressed me, but the one thing that stayed with me about my encounter with Björk was the smell of the room. It was a normal room with a normal smell... but I remember the smell. Musty carpet, perhaps, mixed with the plastic of my press pass.Utopia (One Little Indian) is filled with woodwind instruments and forest feels, a frenzy of flutes and fauna. There are no big hits, no great moments of enlightenment. But with Arca on production duties, the strength of Utopia is the sensory side-effects that stay with you longer: the shimmering echoes, the humanity of the instruments, the aroma of the woodlands the album evokes.Basically, it's well top and good.Scroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.14 – Bola – D.E.G. (Skam Records)Bola is back, and with his most tenuous album title yet.Like Actress, Darrell Fitton was supposed to be in retirement, He began his career helping out with Autechre's debut album Incunabula and supposedly finished his career with 2007's Kroungrine, Ten years ago, I denounced that album as, er, boring, Oops.I was wrong (sorry), and he's back with D.E.G. to remind us all how much we've missed Bola. Think Boards of Canada, Biosphere, The Black Dog. Pretty much any artist beginning with B.Avantual allows so much space around the beats, you're likely to contract agoraphobia. The Pelomen trilogy will nestle under your skin. And the biting Landor 50X2 as good as anything he's done before. It's a tasty album, and a welcome return.Wait. Not Bay City Rollers. It sounds nothing like Bay City Rollers.

However, I have loads of other albums to tell you about. Here are some albums that didn't make the list, and on each one, the jungle is still massive.Special Request has torn up dancefloors before now, but for Belief System (Houndstooth) he mended the dancefloor and turned the club into a Burial-inspired chill-out room. Goldie dropped The Journey Man (Metalheadz), a double-album which may have been better as a single blistering ten-track album. And while we're on a junglist tip, I liked the stampeding sonics of Ninos Du Brasil's Vida Eterna (Hospital Productions).More jungle. If you get the chance, track down the clinical minimalism of Overlook's Smoke Signals (UVB-76 Music), the austere moviedome breaks of Pessimist's Pessimist (Blackest Ever Black) or the delightful collaboration of Jamaica's Gavin Blair and Jordan Chung for Equiknoxx's Colón Man (DDS), an album which takes a true delight in dancehall sounds.The jungle on DJ Manny's Greenlight (Teklife) meets footwork head-on, letting out some lazy g-funk vocals on the way. There's some similar bass-ass jungle and footwork beatery on Jana Rush's first full album Pariah (Objects Limited).And finally, on a more grime tip, and only included here because I couldn't find anywhere else to put it, Lunice finally released his debut album. CCCLX (LuckyMe) had hip hop bangers and bass music aplenty.Side note: binary fans might be pleased to know that this is my 1111st blog post. By that, I don't mean this is my 15th blog post.

It's the kind of cheesiness I would have baulked at when I was younger. Maybe I have changed - or maybe the world is so bleak, we need albums like that.Lindstrøm's It’s Alright Between Us As It Is is this year's cheery inclusion, with its day-bright melodies and chirpy tunes. In some ways it's the audio equivalent of those clean-cut motivational people you get in Wix adverts. QUICK SOMEONE, PUNCH THEM IN THE FACE. In other ways, it's a perfect sound sorbet to counteract all the gloom elsewhere on this list. A Röyksopp to everyone else's Venetian Snares.Also, at one point on the album, Jenny Hval talks about ‘bulging black matter’ in a sultry voice. So, y'know, there's that too.It's Alright Between Us As It Is by LindstrømScroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.16 – Ziúr – U Feel Anything? (Planet Mu)I like the cold. When I’m blue-skinned and goose-bumped, I think “I’m feeling something: I must be alive”. That's an admission I made in Electronic Sound when reviewing this album, and it's true. I'm the kind of idiot who will stand out in the rain because the freezing sogginess of my clothes sticking to my skin reminds me that I am human and I can feel things.It comes as no surprise, then, that I connected with the collage of noises on U Feel Anything? Broken voices and snagged mechanics pepper electronic interludes that spin from ambience to pop to footwork to, simply, noise.There are hooks aplenty, but the cut-and-paste structure means one moment you feel enveloped, the next moment you feel abandoned. Part of the fun here is the thrill of the chase.U Feel Anything? by ZiúrScroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.Not everything can make the top twenty. Here are some techno treats that, although not in the final list of best 2017 albums, are still well worth wiggling your ears at.Call Super's Arpo (Houndstooth) was great. As I said in my review for Electronic Sound: \"Imagine 808 State staggering out of a club at four in the morning, crusted eyes straining at the streetlights. In a rainforest.\"Manchester's Claro Intelecto ‎offered up some interesting work on Exhilarator (Delsin) - check the steely bounce of Guardian Angel - while the beatless trance music of Claude Speeed's Infinity Ultra (Planet Mu) was unlike anything else I heard this year. And Com Truise's Iteration (Ghostly International) gave us synth jams for some far-off sunny boulevard.DB1's junglist Zwischenwelt (Hidden Hawaii) can be best described as \"Euclidean meditations\", while JASSS's dubby Weightless (iDEAL Recordings) brought plenty of colour to an industrial sound. And this might make it sound terrible, but it really is worth making time for the improvised Rhodes jams on Juju & Jordash's Sis-boom-bah! (Dekmantel).The rolling techno of Karen Gwyer's Rembo (Don't Be Afraid) comes with a bonus delight: the track titles consecutively question and answer each other. Track 3 is Why Don't You Make Your Bed? Track 4 is It's Not Worth The Bother. Love it. And finally for this section, listen out for the bobbling party techno of Photay's Onism (Astro Nautico) and the dripping, snarling dub techno of Porter Ricks' Anguilla Electrica (Tresor Records).Plenty more techno to come.Arpo by Call SuperExhilarator by Claro IntelectoScroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.17 – Actress – AZD (Ninja Tune)A zippy delight.

I even illustrated the comment with Obelisk the Gaul, as you can see here.I wouldn't call her third solo album World Of The Waking State a \"banger\". Banging isn't the right noise. I'd perhaps choose \"squelchy\".In fact, she's dialled it down across the board, and what we've ended up is not so much a warehouse rave as a collection of immersive introspective techno worthy of the likes of Higher Intelligence Agency or Warp's Artificial Intelligence albums.Fewer bangs, more feels.Scroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.We're off! This year's top 20 is well underway. Let's divert for a moment into an assorted selection of oddballs that didn't quite make the final list.I enjoyed the nervy ambience and reverberating rhythms of Stargate (Rinse) by Rinse FM's new kid on the block Celestial Trax. The third album from Perc called Bitter Music (Perc Trax) was wonderfully miserable, despite the hilarious \"why don’t you just stick them on\" sample on I Just Can't Win (available on the CD version). And warm the cockles of your wotsits with Hannah Peel's amazing electro-brass adventure Mary Casio: Journey To Cassiopeia (My Own Pleasure).Want something dark and strange? Listen to the shuddering drones of Ben Frost's The Centre Cannot Hold (Mute Records), or the techno lost in dark fog on F Ingers's Awkwardly Blissing Out (Blackest Ever Black), or the Maori instruments getting reduced to shards in Fis and Rob Thorne's Clear Stones (Subtext).And finally for this tiny section of also-rans, Duran Duran Duran's Duran (Power Vacuum) gave us an endless rave, Bambooman's Whispers (Accidental Jnr) mixed hip hop, house and lounge but in a good way, I liked the vocal-smothered chaos of Chino Amobi's PARADISO (NON) and although I try not to include reissues in this round-up, if you plump for Randomize's ¿Como Se Divertirán Los Insectos? (A Harmless Deed) then you'll end up with Eno-esque experimentalism from 1980s Spain.

Imagine me licking your eyeballs and nuzzling your tonsils. Imagine what that feels and sounds like. The slobbering, the slurping, the farting. This is called ASMR (Auto Sensory Meridian Response), an experience that inspired Antwood's latest album.In fact, the album's second track The New Industry contains the kind of weeping that the above situation may induce in you.Sponsored Content feels like we're caught in the modern Blade Runner universe, with all the sounds and feels chopped up by Holly Herndon.

The broken beat on Istian seems uniquely Gamble, following its own rhythmic logic, while tracks like UE8 feel like a horrendous club flashback. And yes, that's a cowbell amid the hallucinatory Quadripoints.With its wonky rhythms, Mnestic Pressure will please junglists looking for something more ambient. For a more colourful description of Gamble's work, let's turn to a comment on Discogs:\"If a red 1994 Honda Accord blaring jungle smashed into a gallery showcasing 19th Century pastoral paintings, and somewhere in there a computer existed, then you might get a glimpse to Lee Gamble's music.\"Lawks.Lee Gamble - Mnestic Pressure (HDBCD037) by Lee GambleScroll all of the best 2017 electronic albums by clicking here.Before we get stuck into the top 20, here are some ambient albums that didn't quite make the final list.Norway's Biosphere offered a stirring dreamscape of Archie Mayo’s 1936 crime drama The Petrified Forest in, you guessed it, The Petrified Forest (Biophon Records). Brian Eno seemed utterly suspended in animation as he dropped his nautical noodlings his latest Warp album, the excellent Reflection (Warp Records). And Dopplereffekt returned to great effect with the interplanetary electro ambience of Cellular Automata (Leisure System).What else? Check out the magical bleeps of Alessandro Cortini's AVANTI (Point Of Departure), the leisurely and classical No Home Of The Mind (4AD) from Bing & Ruth, and the wild, almost geometric rhythms of Burnt Friedman's The Pestle (Latency).After two decades, Wolfgang Voigt turned back on the GAS supply for Narkpop (Kompakt). For extra sleepiness, listen to Hiroshi Yoshimura's Music For Nine Post Cards (Empire Of Signs), an old album available outside Japan for the first time, and lose yourself in the fuzzy ether of Jacaszek's KWIATY (Ghostly International).More ambient also-rans later on.

Drowned In Sound called it \"unspeakably romantic\". Pitchfork just banged on for ages and used the word \"sophomore\" six hundred times.Burial's mystique helped. It took the press five years to discover Burial's identity. \"I wanted to use the sound of the earth,\" said Alan Titchmarsh after being exposed by Homes & Gardens magazine. \"If you listen closely, it's mostly trowels.\"His production techniques have been much copied, although we seem to forget that, famously, Untrue was produced by ghosts. This posed difficult logistics for studio staff. \"They couldn't use the water cooler,\" I remember one assistant saying in an interview, \"because their hands kept going through the little cone cups.\"The album is a beautiful listen. Here's a Resident Advisor tribute to the album, which is a pretty good primer for those yet to get into Burial. Long may Alan's (and his ghosts') excellent work continue."},

Those snippets of music that get caught in your thoughts. The \"oh oh oh oh oh\" of New Kids On The Block's Right Stuff. The \"I don't want a place to stay\" bit of Technotronic's Pump Up The Jam. Little audio hooks by Alice Deejay, MGMT, Drake or flipping Adele. Usually when I can name an insistent melody, it slowly fades. But I had a tune in my head all day yesterday I couldn't name. A cheesy melodic wash that was tickling me something rotten. I can't explain it here, but it went \"da doo do doo de doo doo\". I'd heard it somewhere before, maybe from Spotify's New Music Friday service. Was it new, though? I tried to put lyrics to it, but I couldn't tell if it was a shiny recent single or something dusty from my youth. Last night, I went to bed with it in my head. I yearned for a good sleep so I could wake afresh and immediately declare \"yes! it's so-and-so b-side from (insert obscure indie band)!\"I slept. I dreamt. Then in the morning, my phone alarm woke me up.The ear-worm was my chuffing Samsung phone alarm. Flipping heck.

Wait. No, not Timmy Mallett.Way Out West came from that scene too, but their sound was lighter. A music meringue. They straddled trance and drum 'n' bass, and I think they hit a particularly sweet spot on their 1996 singles The Gift and Domination. The latter sampled three different John F Kennedy speeches, all for just three words: \"madness, power, domination\". Not that we have any of that kind of nonsense in today's political climate. Ahem.I had a chat with the Way Out West chaps today. We talked about the old days, when all this was just fields. They both mentioned their love for LTJ Bukem, and their recollection of playing on Top Of The Pops was particularly amusing - although you'll have to wait for a future edition of Electronic Sound for that story.Just like Timmy Mallett, they're still going. Unlike Timmy Mallett, they haven't taken up fine art. (Seriously: check out Mallett's Palette.) Way Out West's latest work has a distinctly Balearic feel, which is probably a reflection of soaking up all that sun on their international DJing schedule. I live in Manchester so I have to ask Timmy Mallett to paint my suns. He really brings out those yellows.Have listen to recent track Oceans and old track Domination below."},

'The Desecration of Desire' will be out next month on Skint Records. Yes, THAT Skint Records.

Fusion techno that's as agitated as it is celebratory.Below, I've plopped down some YouTube embeds for you to listen to, all taken from that album.Banco De Gaia is DJing too: his 'Last Train To Lhasa' album is a modern ambient masterpiece that, thanks to dreamy samples, changed the way I heard choo-choo trains forever.

{"title": "Fats at the Lowry: my last day at the Edinburgh Fringe", "date": "Aug 27, 2017", "text": "I probably should tie off these Edinburgh Fringe witterings with a nice big bow.On the last day attending shows at the Fringe, I saw Sofie Hagen. She was really good, with plenty of warnings about the power of men in family units. I then popped off to see 'Parsley', which was by Michael Brunström and it was all about parsley. He even had someone making parsley sauce.I decided to end my Fringe experience with Transit, a big ole circus performance with lots of people jumping about. You'd think I'd find no inspiration for my own show here, but even that had structure and audience interaction and oodles of light and shade. After 20 shows in three days (technically three days and four hours), I became an expert in picking apart the building blocks of the stuff I was seeing.Performance elements I liked throughout my time in Edinburgh:> Unpredictability. Brian Gittins's volatility on a double decker bus as he allowed the audience to almost ruin the show is something that will stay with me for a long time.> Failure. It was okay if things went wrong. Some phone responses during Siri seemed to misfire, and the balloon-throwing finale at Tape Face missed a beat because the 'victim' didn't follow his instructions. Indeed, the circus performers made mistakes. Doesn't matter. The ideas still worked.> Generosity. From John Luke Roberts' ramshackle props to Joe Morpurgo's frenzied hijacking of his audience, my favourite moments were when the performer seemed to give abundantly to the audience. The ideas and jokes came quickly.And things that turned me off:> Just watching. I was less keen on performances that seemed a static, in which we were only onlookers. It wasn't so bad, though, if there were interesting things to look at - or if the performer(s) was a powerhouse.> Laziness. By this, I mean, ideas that weren't explored enough. Bolting a theme onto already-written routines, or ideas that didn't go far enough. Wasted opportunities. Not that there was much of this - overall, I'm very happy with the shows I chose to attend this year.I've been back from Edinburgh for a couple of days. I've been in a bit of a comedown funk, which is probably natural. I've had the Will Smith single 'Wild Wild West' going around my head. Which, as I commented on a friend's Facebook feed, is a tragedy. This is the curse of Will Smith. Despite 'Men In Black', 'Summertime', 'Miami', 'Boom Shake The Room', Gettin' Jiggy Wit It' AND the Fresh Prince theme, his weakest hit 'Wild Wild West' will always be the one that sticks.Poor guy.This is the kind of thing I dwell on when I'm on a Fringe comedown.This Edinburgh Fringe trip was an attempt to gain inspiration for my new show for The Lowry, which will premiere in May.

Anyhoo, it led me to a conclusion about my planning process, which I shall share at the end of this blog post.I caught a bunch of stand-up comedians. Tony Law was in typical free-wheeling mode with added shadow puppetry... which was also free-wheeling. With this being Tony, the puppetry didn't really need to lead anywhere. It was just fun to watch.Speaking of not particularly leading anywhere, Simon Munnery's on form this year. 'Renegade Plumber' made me want to central heat my tent. I even got to meet his dog (pictured). Like me, Munnery has props, and he isn't afraid to furrow a particular niche thought, such as his long technical explanation about inventing a new water heater.I caught Richard Gadd's show during which he runs. A lot. On a running machine. This was a frenetic, dizzying work with a solid emotional payoff. He got a standing ovation. The audio track must have been huge fun to work on - and hugely time consuming. I don't think I'll run in my own show. I'll be doing well if I even stay standing upright.I've seen some amazing comedy this year, but Brian Gittins had me laughing the most. His show was on the BlundaBus, brought to the Fringe by quickly-expanding newcomer promoter Heroes. Brian was, in short, terrifying. Okay, we were packed in on the top floor of a double-decker bus, but this truly was close-up comedy. Volatile, awkward, and superbly silly.If Brian Gittins isn't winning the big comedy awards, the system's knacked.And now non-comedy stuff. I saw a show about Siri. I've never used Siri. Did everyone's phones become sentient? Not quite. Siri, a one-woman and one-digital assistant show, was a compelling tech nightmare that felt very real. Too real. She had two projection screens - one translucent, leading to a deeply sinister big-face moment.I saw a mind-reading show, which was great fun, but I could have explained everything that happened in the room. Especially as I saw the mind-reader asking the audience questions before the show. \"Your name's Sally Smith and you were born on 31st October.\" The audience goes \"wooo\". Yeah. He, in disguise, asked her. She was next to me in the queue. Pah.Luke Wrights Frankie Vah was an accomplishment. Effectively, it's a one-hour poem disguised as theatre. The narrative was bound in 1980s left wing politics, with all the frustration, fire and fury that entailed. At one point he acted out someone performing at their first open mic night - whimpers of recognition from me.What else? Puppetry, plumbing, running, bus, big-face, fakery and fire. I think that's it. Enough for one day.I've had numerous thoughts about my own show today. I need to work harder. I need to be better. I need to match my game with all the amazing people I've seen. But most of all, I'm left with one over-riding thought:There are no rules. I've seen naked Chaucer, a fake Q&A, a tape-faced man, a treadmill tragedy and I've thrown raisins into Brian Gittins' face. There are simply no rules. Just do what works for you.I'd imagine that's Simon Munnery's dog's mantra for life too. I've more Fringe to go, but I'm taking it easier today. I may catch one show. Maybe three. To be honest, I'm now desperate to return home and do show writing. Stay tuned.(This blog post is dedicated to Domino, the wonderful woof-dog who is my boarding companion during my stay in Edinburgh. Hello, Domino, if you're reading.)"},
{"title": "Fats at the Lowry: Morpurgo's done it again", "date": "Aug 23, 2017", "text": "I'm farting about at the Edinburgh Fringe, but it's not entirely for pleasure. I'm on the look out for inspiration, information and even the occasional omen for my next show. These blog posts are acting as a virtual think board as I traipse around Scotland's streets.I started today with some proper theatre: 'Action At A Distance' was a play about a data analyst and a plumber betting on terrible things. They took drone strikes, cancer and financial desperation - all the fun things (!) - and filled the hour with humanity and levity.Despite the horrific subject matter, the harshest brutality was in the acidic mother / daughter relationship: a volley of verbal drone strikes. It reminded me that human stories resonate most strongly, especially in a domestic environment - home is where the hurt is. Oh and they drew on the floor, which gave me ideas.I then saw a standup show and an improv show. Both shall remain nameless because this is not a review and being negative isn't the point.The standup show had a clever gimmick which made me buy the ticket: in reality, it was a straight-down-the-line observational comedy set with the gimmick tacked on. If only it had been braver. I've not seen much improv, but the improv show left me a little annoyed. When I've seen Paul Merton do improv, he grabs a lot of ideas from the audience. We're given the sense of driving what happens on stage. With today's show, they did this once at the start: we chose a word that had little consequence to the actions on stage. And then they acted for an hour. Was the whole thing improvised or was it just a badly written play? With no further input from us, it was hard to feel invested.Lesson: involve the audience. 'Dust' was great. It's a play by Milly Thomas in which a woman observes the aftermath of her own suicide. The stage set was entirely colourless, a brutal purgatory allowing space for metaphorical and literal self-examination. The sound design was immense, with crackles and rumbles of doom providing contrast to melodic moments of emotion later on. Make a note in your audio-ideas book, Fats,I'm running out of time. What else did I see today? Oh yes - Beach Hunks, a sketch group with the sort of chemistry that makes you want to be their mate. Also, I am their mate, so I'm biased, but 'Hog Wild' is a great show.Tape Face! I finally saw Tape Face. This was my first BIG show of the Fringe: clearly with a budget much bigger than mine. He was astonishing: sweet, silly, surprising and with a truly spiriting finale. It reminded me that it's worth studying the old arts: clowning, mime, the jesters. And get a team around you that can absolutely nail the audio and visual cues.Last and by all means most, I saw Joseph Morpurgo's 'Hammerhead'. I don't want to say too much, and it's best to go into the show without knowing what to expect. His 2015 show 'Soothing Sounds For Baby' remains the best thing I have seen at the Edinburgh Fringe: it became an inspirational template for the show I am writing now. When I plan through what I want to do with my show, I think of 'Soothing Sounds For Baby'.His new show 'Hammerhead' is a staggering triumph, and if you were unlucky enough to miss 'Baby', then let THIS show be your best-thing and your template and your whatnot. My main take-away from Joe Morpurgo? There are no rules. There simply are no rules. Just do what you love. Now that Morpurgo's nailed it again, I might as well go home. But I can't. I've more things to see today. Stay tuned."},

I've decided to be poncy and give some kind of artistic reflection as I attend gubbins at this year's Fringe. Not reviews. Just (half) thoughts made of the mouldier bits of my brain.I'm hoping to return from the Fringe with a vague mulch of inspiration for my #DevelopedWith commission for the Lowry. That means exiting shows and taking immediately to Twitter. What you're about to read over the next few days are those tweets mangled blog posts.My first stop was John Luke Roberts's Look on My Works, Ye Mighty, and Despair! (All  in Caps). Like many others, I returned to see Roberts following his previous show about a balloon-man monster. Yeah, I said it. A balloon-man monster.This was one-man show with costumes and, er, non-costumes, and so well written. His Chaucer piece is perfection, every wayward syllable a joy as he acts out a kind of amphetamined Officer Crabtree. He's got super silly props (beard scroll) and very natural audience interaction: we easily come onside with him. Boy, that lad can write. Not afraid of a corny punchline either: his confidence carries it. Lovely sense of the macabre too.Next up was Graham Dixon Is The Narcissist, an exploration of a fictional Russian writer told through layers of personalities. It was silly but oddly heavy, which I put down not to the \"Russian gulag\" overtones of the subject matter but to the more theatrical set-up: raked seating, stark layout (a single chair) and unforgiving lighting. I wonder how that would feel in, say, The Stand.Not a band thing but take out, say, half a dozen punchlines and it could be hard work. Thankfully, Dixon had some lovely monologues peppered with Pythonesque surreality, and a neat way of hurling an exercise book across the stage.Turning my thoughts to my own show - which is what this Edinburgh trip is all about - the simplicity of his set confirmed in my mind that I'd want my show to have a lot to look at. Plenty of treats for the eyes. Throwaway visual gags everywhere.Speaking of throwaway visual gags, I saw Sam Simmons too. Always a favourite. Far fewer props this time but plenty of delightful non-sequiturs. His badminton piece with an audience member is as good as anything he's done before. (No spoilers here, but it's so sharp and very Sam.)Both him and Dixon played with voiceover: the extra voice as antagonist in Dixon's case or as reinforcement in Simmons' case as he takes against the audience. I liked that muchly, and is a device that is particularly useful for my show.More to come - click here for my other Lowry prep tweeting."},

I call them Anothaftermountjets for short.These albums came out shortly after I was born, and although I've heard dribbles of them over the years, it's been interesting to dive into them properly for the first time. Listening to the whole lot, in order. It's definitely the sound of Eno transitioning from Roxy Music into something much wibbly woo. That's a technical music term, by the way.Also, Another Green World is an anagram of 'angered trowel horn'.It's a strange feeling to step into Bowie-era Eno.

Are we whizzing around its craters in bubblecars?

They're in order of success (number of weeks at number one then number of weeks in the chart) because I am too stubborn to throw off the notion that chart trivia stripped of its context is a useful thing.I can only assume from this list that since the turn of the millennium, no-one wants songs about the moon.Connie Francis - Carolina Moon. Number one in 1958. I don't know this one and because the title reminds me of 'Oh Carolina', I can only imagine her sounding like Shaggy.Stargazers - I See The Moon. Number one in 1954. Is 1954 even a year?! The moon wasn't even invented then.Creedence Clearwater Revival - Bad Moon Rising. Number one in 1969. \"Hope you are quite prepared to die.\" Thanks for that, Clarence or whatever your name was.Showaddywaddy - Under The Moon Of Love. Number one in 1976. Reality TV stars before there was reality TV, with a band name to match.Danny Williams - Moon River. Number one in 1961 / 62. You spelled 'rover' wrong, Danny, jeez.Marcels - Blue Moon. Number one in 1961. Their in-your-face rendition of a staid classic probably rustled a few starched feathers.

It went so well I actually punched the air after I walked off stage. This is very unlike me.Sorry, the air. You didn't deserve to be punched.When I say \"well\", I don't mean that the audience was throwing garlands. Going \"well\" is more about me hitting my intended 'marks' throughout the performance: script, tone, pacing. Making it look loose and uncontrolled, and yet ticking mental boxes throughout. Performing things that make me laugh, performing them properly - and hoping that the audience will come along with me.I also sneaked in possible ideas for my Lowry show, which I have previously waffled on about on this site. My gigs have become more music-filled than before, giving me more freedom to lark about doing nonsense. This change in style is a huge signpost towards what I want to achieve for my 2018 show.Partly because I want to be transparent, and partly for my own recollection, here is my set list from that 20-minute performance. If you weren't there, this is going to make little sense. Enjoy!1. Intro music, massive eye dance, destruction of radio2. Annoying voice-over, mentioning \"elephurbs\"3.

Tingles.And what about those breakbeat vibes on the EP's title track Seeing? We've had plenty of 1990's comebacks, but no-one's quite nailed the post-club thing like this.Calling this 'retro' is a bit reductive: explore Prayer and you'll hear proper modern bass music beefed up by a filmic sensibility.

This shifts the frequencies of the notes from their standard tones to make a more textured sound. The change isn't huge - just enough for you to think that something's pleasingly \"off\".For example: we all know that the lit green person on a pelican crossing means \"cross the road\". It's a standard we all recognise. But what the green person was wearing a fedora? Or a cape? Or one big shoe? You'd still cross the road, but perhaps with a little frisson in your step.Aphex Twin has given the Korg Monologue one big shoe. The results sound great.Click here to read a geeky music technology interview between Aphex Twin and the guy he worked on the Monologue with, Tatsuya Takahashi, whose home is pictured above.

Here are my five favourite tracks in no particular order. Enjoy.Musicology - Telefone 529Otherwise known as the massively important IDM duo B12. They later scooped up a whole bunch of their limited coloured-vinyl 12-inches for the Electro-Soma Artificial Intelligence album.Autechre - CrystelOne of the Rochdale band's earliest tracks.The Dice Man - Polygon WindowNo doubt named after the Luke Rhinehart book, The Dice Man would later become Polygon Window, which is the name of this track.

It’s Regret by Shinichi Atobe.This is from a recent album called From The Heart, It's A Start, A Work Of Art, which comes from further plundering of Atobe’s lost archive. Much of the album is from an acetate cut in Berlin 17 years ago – only five copies were made until now.Until a few years ago, he had released one solitary 12-inch (Ship-Scope EP) before vanishing without a trace. Over a decade later, the Demdike Stare label tracked down the elusive producer and discovered a stack of unreleased tunes. A recent album almost made my top albums of the year list.If the YouTube rip below disappears, have a listen here to Shinichi Atobe’s album on Boomkat."},

You were right, tweety person, you were right. 1997 was a great year for music.It's good to measure these things so let's get specific. I decided to look at the singles chart exactly 20 years ago. 23rd June 1997. Let's wallow in a memorable year of fantastic tunes, shall we?1. Puff Daddy's mawkish I'll Be Missing You was number one. Okay. Not so great. But all the good songs get to number two, right?2. Bitter Sweet Symphony. And there's the good number two. Never did make it to the top of the charts. THANKS, Puff.3. Mmm Bop by Hanson.  Three flesh muppets talking nonsense. Oh dear.4. Ocean Colour Scene? Bog off. I'd drain the oceans and watch all aqua life writhe and die before listening to this shambles again.I'm not convinced this is really working. Let's speed things up. Time to skip some numbers and get to the real meat of this burger of musical joy.9. Guiding Star by Cast. Possibly the most annoying band of the 90s, and the band I have heckled the loudest. Make them stop.11. Celine Dion? Crumbs. I'd forgotten about the boat-mouthed siren that was Celine. Ouch.18. Savage Garden?! Worst S-band name ever. Apart from Shed Seven. And Salad.22. The Friends theme tune that was in the charts forever. I'd rather have the clap clap clap clap.This is terrible. This week in 1997 was a travesty. Jon Bon Jovi, Sarah Brightman, Brand New Heavies, Wet Wet Wet. All this chart proves is that 1997 was a verruca on the foot of the 1990s - and even then it's not a foot, it's just some weeping stump on the diseased leg of the 20th century.No wait. I've found something.87. The Saint by Orbital. Not their most remembered track, but with 11 weeks in the chart and a high point of number 3, it remains their best charting single. Kept off the top spot in April 1997 by I Believe I Can Fly and Song 2.Yay! Told you 1997 was good.Yeesh."},

The distant rhythms of November's Young Death / Nightmarket EP were gloriously sparse, and were a brilliant precursor to Subtemple - no apparent audio relation to Temple Sleeper - which really does cast us out into the neverending vacuum of space.A beatless Burial shouldn't work.

Have a listen to it in the trailer below.I never like people who worry sacred cows, and indeed there's a skeleton yard of failed sequels throughout movie history. This project has sacred cow molestation written all over it. Yeesh.

I'm an Older Harrison Ford sceptic. I even cheered a little when that thing happened in a certain big film not so long ago.Overall, I think this particular origami cow should lead a happy and untroubled life.

Which one isn't true?1. Like the Beatles, Delia Derbyshire was turned down by Decca Records. It seems back in those days, they didn't employ women in their recording studios.2. Delia Derbyshire had a phenomenal analytical ear. There's a rumour that she could listen to a record and tell you exactly where any instrument was located during the recording.3. Delia Derbyshire composed music and sounds for over 200 shows, often building \"real\" world sounds from sine waves because samplers weren't really a thing.4. Delia Derbyshire once took part in an electronic music concert which also featured electronic works by a certain Paul McCartney, whoever the heck he is.5. Delia Derbyshire never got credits for her creations because the BBC had a policy of veiling the Radiophonic Workshop workers in anonymity.6. Delia Derbyshire invented space aliens, and even now there is a race of amphibious robot mannequins who have stored her brain in a jar in the hope that one day Mecha Delia Derbyshire will rise up against humankind and, with laser eyes shooting and bazooka knees firing, rampage across a devastated earth to explode the innards of every single person who has ever (a) used, (b) heard or (c) thought about the musical production technique commonly known as \"autotune\". As Delia noted in her book from the distant future How I Destroyed The Universe (she also invented time travel), gilled android dummies really hate autotune. In an ironic twist, Delia Derbyshire teamed up with Davros to co-create the Daleks. These trundling pedal bins became famous for their war cry \"exterminate, exterminate\" using voices which were, of course, electronically autotuned. Oh Delia."},

And sat next to me were far superior neighbours next door, including 808 State's Graham Massey and Twisted Nerve's Andy Votel. I'm not sure which one's Jerry and which one's Margot in that analogy.Also on the panel were Tom Autobot, DJ Euphonique (who took the above photo), Aaron from the Lost Village Festival and, from his pad in Ibiza, DJ Doorly. We talked about the ubiquity of music technology and how good mini-Moogs  were. Inevitably for a male-dominated panel, we were challenged about opportunities for women. I brought a bunch of Electronic Sound magazines with me, which  were devoured by Manchester MIDI School students.The Music Symposium Series is run by former Ministry of Sound Operations Director, Tony Rigg, who hosted the discussion brilliantly. It was a sold-out gig and it was great to be in the company of so many fellow bleep-heads. Loads of them were young and bright-eyed and starting their first big music projects. They were so like me at that age: optimism mixed with energetic impatience and a need to make their voice heard.

It's well overdue a raving.Arcadian first appeared on an EP back in 1992. I discovered it on Warp Record's brain-meltingly brilliant Artificial Intelligence compilations a couple of years later. Everyone was producing instrumental ambient techno: I should know - that scene was my world back then. This Link track stood out: it was gentle yet hard as nails, much of its power coming from that rattling snare hit.Of course it stood out. Link was Mark Pritchard, of Under The Sun and Global Communication fame. He's seventeen shades of genius; a musical Midas. Mark Pritchard could jam his head into a wood-chipper and still produce the most beautiful sounds. \"Aaaargh my face,\" screams Pritchard. \"Ten out of ten!\" declares Pitchfork.It's not a friendly track, not like his other ambient stuff. It's metronomic and a little pinched.

Aphex Twin's real name is Richard D James. The D stands for 'down south' which is where he lives.2. The '26 Mixes For Cash' scandal nearly ruined his career. Since then, it has been illegal for members of the House of Lords to procure drill 'n' bass remixes without declaring them.3. Aphex Twin once owned a tank. His favourite trick was to put a goldfish on the passenger seat and ask it \"how do you drive this thing\".4. His comeback album Syro used, at some point in the recording process, every instrument ever created. Apart from the five-string banjo. And the tuba.5. The old woman who gets screamed at in the Come To Daddy video was played by Aphex Twin after a particularly long day in the studio.6. Aphex Twin made tracks while lucid dreaming. He installed a full studio inside his head, enabling him to work while asleep. This is why he has a USB port in the side of his head.7. He once uploaded so many tracks to Soundcloud, Ed Sheeran has been number one ever since.8. His first album was Selected Ambient Works 85-92, which incidentally are also the measurements of his bust and hips.9. His pseudonyms have included: Nasty Window, Twinny McTwinface, Billy Skinhole, Polygon Idiot, Tssk Tssk, Hello Brian, Susan Boyle, Caustic Postman and AFC BOURNEMOUTH.10. Aphex Twin has wonderfully soft hair. He puts this down to never playing the tuba.

The artist then starts to perform the track you selected, which is how the music appears in your ears.And because it's electricity, it happens almost instantly.Every time an artist gets a piece of music played on Spotify, they receive thirty-seven hundred dollars.

Unlike, of course, physical sales in which the acts only get a button and a chewed ballpoint pen for every CD sold.The Victorians used Spotify a lot because it was the easiest way to distribute those bicycles with the huge front wheels. Its usage tailed off after the Great Hat Dispute of 1875: the Victorian's early experiments with wearable technology resulted in a large number of mass casualties. The person who brought Spotify back into public popularity was Howard Donald from Take That, although I can't explain why for legal reasons.So make the music world a better place by launching the Fat Roland Spotify playlist here. It comprises most of the tracks I've waffled on about on Fat Roland.co.uk in 2017 - and do follow the list because there'll be more to come.Further Fats: If you ask me, people on the internet should talk about the internet more (2008)Further Fats: Do you pay for your record collection?

Yeah, he's a Sir now.Have a listen to the theme tune below, which bubbles up repeatedly throughout each episode as Robinson bounces around the garden. I'd listen to an album of this gloopy, acidic techno. It feels like sonic mulch, all squidgy and satisfying underfoot. The music's producer Kevin Stoney calls it \"squelchy\" and he's not wrong. I'd like this kind of squelchy life.It makes me wonder: I'm pretty jealous of 1980s musicians who had all this new gear to play with.

Their so-called stadium house trilogy of What Time Is Love?, 3am Eternal and Last Train To Trancentral set my teenage brain ablaze. Their guerrilla grime. The horned hoods. The mock mythology.

{"title": "Charts in crisis: here's why there are so few number one singles", "date": "Jan 2, 2017", "text": "There are no more UK number one singles left.In 2016, there were only 11 UK number one singles. This equals the lowest record set in 1954 when Doris Day and Yorkshire warbler David Whitfield dominated the charts.This is a huge drop off considering 2014 had 38 chart toppers. If this trend continues, in 2017 there will be -2 chart toppers. That's right. We'll go into the minuses. If they do another Top Of The Pops, it will simply be a video of antimatter.To demonstrate this alarming statistic, I've made a graphic (above). This shows the number of separate number one singles over the past decade expressed in sizes of Drake. Drake is not a duck: he is a hugely successful music artist who enjoyed 15 weeks at number one last year. Drake should be used in all bar charts.There can be only one explanation. It's upsetting, but I don't want to hide the truth from you.ALL THE MUSIC STARS ARE DEAD. Let's face it: all the celebrities popped the bucket in 2016. Kicked their clogs. Maybe there was no-one left to have number one singles.No, wait, hold on. That's not right.The actual answer seems to be volume of weekly sales. There are two clues. 1992 and 2007.In 1992, the year of Ebeneezer Goode (pictured) and Rhythm Is A Dancer, single sales tanked. There were only 12 number one singles that year. Likewise, in 2007, the CD collapsed as a format and single sales again fell: you could top the chart with a fraction of what you needed just a few years earlier. And as you can see in the chart above, in 2007 there were relatively few number ones.By contrast, the measuring of downloads and streams saw single sales rocket at the start of this decade. So the opposite trend happened: as sales increased, we saw a big increase in the quantity of chart toppers in any one year.Seems odd?Nope. It's mathematics in action. Low weekly sales means a single's chart run is exhausted slowly. The songs then stick around like musical farts. Conversely, high weekly sales sees their sales potential exhausted in no time at all. Sometimes after just one week. Theoretically, a track with 200,000 sales could spend one week at number one in 2013 - or ten weeks at number one in 2007.Which also reveals something else quite sobering.There are certain totems that stick around at number one forever. In 1992, Whitney Houston spent 10 weeks at number one. In 2007, Rihanna spent 10 weeks at number one. In 2016, Drake spent 15 weeks at number one.Notice something about those years? I bet the same is true for Bryan Adams and Wet Wet Wet too. Record-breaking chart toppers? Or merely mathematical musical farts?Footnote: This is based on a theory once posited by James Masterton.

{"title": "Best electronic albums of 2016: one", "date": "Dec 31, 2016", "text": "Thanks for reading this albums list, if indeed you've been following it so far. I guess I now know what the week after Christmas is for. Four days of solid blogging. And it's all been leading to this: the best electronic album of 2016 according to me.1 – Bwana – Capsule's Pride (LuckyMe)\"What the hell is this?\" this album asks of itself 1 minute 32 seconds into The Colonel's Mistake, The Scientist's Regret.It's a remix. Of a soundtrack. Of a manga classic. At number one.Why would you use a cheesy English dub of Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira movie for your remix album? Because awkward works. When the soundtrack was released on vinyl, Canadian Berliner Nathan 'Bwana' Micay shoved the whole thing through an Ableton mincer. What he produced was astonishing.Capsule's Pride could have been a straight tribute album. A tribal Kaneda's theme set to a techno beat, perhaps. But Bwana rebuilt everything from the ground up. Things are chopped, accelerated, reverbed.So Kaneda's theme becomes a snappy melodic pulse following its own tune. The corny \"it's the cops! what shall we do?\" dialogue from the bike chase scene morphs into a tense climactic moment in the addictive title track.In one sense, this is a 1990s-infused house music album through-and-through. However, Bwana's liberal use of samples and melodic themes from an idiosyncratic source is so judiciously targeted that he builds a complete new world. A gawky world where you're never far away from someone shouting \"Kaneda!\" or \"Ah! Ki! Ra!\" to remind you where you are. It's wonderful.This swings from ambient noir to dancefloor brilliance. I've never known the energy of manga expressed this way before. I'm not especially a fan of anime. And that's the genius of Capsule's Pride: since this was released free via a brilliant microsite (try it on your mobile), I feel I've got to know Tetsuo and his universe. I'm almost longing for World War III, dystopian governance and being ambushed by Clowns.Speaking of which, here's to 2017. Arf! See what I did there? It's funny because it's true.

Well, sort of. It was more of a guarded comment so I didn't spoil my full review in issue 21 of Electronic Sound - in which I lauded the work having \"more hooks than an angler’s tool box\". Still, the Plaid chaps noticed.@FatRoland Wow, thanks ! 😊 This is the first feedback we've had on the album as a whole other than from friends. Seen this @thebeedrones ?— Plaid (@Plaid) May 30, 2016Bless their, er, plaid socks. The Digging Remedy is more accessible than most of their previous 11 albums. The scratchiness is still there, as are their trademark chord sequences. You can recognise Plaid's sound a mile off. But it's smoothed out, all guitar-glistened and melodic. This is Plaid at their cheeriest, yet still, closer Wen made me well up.To be truly understood, Plaid have to be seen live. At their Manchester gig earlier this year (pictured above), they became the absence of triangles in one of the cleverest visual set-ups I've seen for a while. As they were in the middle of their cute-as-a-button Melifer, the bloke next to me exclaimed \"I didn't know they did songs like THIS.\"\"THIS\" being an older Plaid, more thoughtful, but still willing to kick it out of the park with the towering Yu Mountain and the trippy confidence of CLOCK.

And their best album since their early days.Stream Do Matter here.Scroll all of the best 2016 electronic albums by clicking here.Before I reveal the toppest top albums atop the album top table, here are a final few names that didn't make the top 20 but are well worth a mention.Baauer fiiiiinally dropped a debut album: Aa (LuckyMe) was full of scrunchy bangers to shake yer Harlems and much more besides. A grimier, stronger brother to that album is Skepta's Konnichiwa (Boy Better Know), with Novelist guesting on both those albums. Incidentally, this is not a hip hop list, but while we're on an MC tip, get yourself And The Anonymous Nobody by De La Soul (AOI Records).Machinedrum bogged off to California to turn out his poppiest long-player yet, Human Energy (Ninja Tune). The rambling Callus (Warp Records) saw Gonjasufi in as psychedelic a mood as ever before. DJ Earl brought in Oneohtrix Point Never for his delightfully dizzying footwork experiment Open Your Eyes (Teklife). And Mala took in some Peruvian inspiration (and panpipes) for the bass-heavy and beguiling Mirrors (Brownswood Recordings). I was less convinced by Zomby's Ultra (Hyperdub) which seemed to float by unnoticed.On EARS (Western Vinyl), Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith did some wonderful things with voice on an unusual and captivating album. These Hidden Hands did some weird things to my brain on the woozy and surreal Vicarious Memories (Hidden Hundred). Lakker did strange, dark things on the theme of water with Struggle & Emerge (R&S Records). And finally, Matmos did some unspeakable things to a washing machine on Ultimate Care II (Thrill Jockey). No really. The whole album is constructed from washing machine samples.That's the last of the rejects. Over 100 albums mentioned... and just two to go in the final top 20 countdown.

The completion of Apparat and Modeselektor’s Moderat studio album trilogy has led to their best work yet for Monkeytown: tune after tune after tune.If III lacks the depth of II, it’s because they’ve gone for the pop hits. But what hits, so richly produced. The epic breaks of Reminder. The gleaming house of Running. The tragic melancholy of the xx-inflected The Fool. If the chart sounded like this all the time, I’d retract my Bruno Brookes comments.Yes, it’s bombastic. Yearning. It’s the most unsubtle of the three; the one with the Ewoks. Cor, I'm really damning with faint praise here. At least I'm not still likening them to Steps. But you mark my words: the techniques that make this album so stellar will be cookie-cuttered by producers for years to come. A spellbinding listen start to finish. Three out of three.Scroll all of the best 2016 electronic albums by clicking here.4 – Slam – Machine Cut Noise (Soma)All Slam albums are techno, but some Slam albums are more techno than others. It’s easy to forget Slam used to be a vocal band. Cue memories of Dot Allison’s floaty vocals. Not so here. Machine Cut Noise is an insane assault of planet-sized sonic weaponry.Each track is unrelenting in its Orwellian disregard of anything approaching humanity. There is no escape from the thundering bass drums, the ominous synths, the hissing snares. I joked in November about a Slam Tent. It’s not a tent. It’s a prison.Yet, it’s also hypnotising. Liberating. Even exhilarating. It might be Stockholm Syndrome, but you will lose yourself in the metronomic majesty of Slam’s most impressive album yet. If you want a vision of Machine Cut Noise, imagine a bass drum stamping on your face forever. But in a good way.Scroll all of the best 2016 electronic albums by clicking here.Almost there. Here's a bunch of solid techno albums that didn't make my final list.I didn't want to deal with old stuff, so no space in my top 20 for the newly polished-up classic Mike & Rich's Expert Knob Twiddlers (Planet Mu). That also goes for Altern 8's Full-On Mask Hysteria (Bleech) which carries the only design in the world I'd have tattooed on my face. And no space either for the hugely pleasing 1995 (Skam), an ancient Jega album found on an old tape somewhere.Here are three names I was sad not to include, including two names in my best-of-2011. I liked the sprawling soundtrack styles of Kuedo's Slow Knife (Planet Mu). And Illum Sphere's Glass (Ninja Tune) had a kind of echoing subterranean vibe that made me want to live in a techno submarine. Meanwhile, Surgeon kicked up an evil disco with From Farthest Known Objects (Dynamic Tension).On a lighter housier note, it may be worth looking into the airy jazz-tinged electronics of Steven Julien's Fallen (Apron Records), the '90s bleepery of A Sagittariun's Elasticity (Elastic Dreams) or how about Shinichi Atobe's World (DDS), all sprightly beats and dubby ambience.Only one more of these 'also-rans' round-ups left while the main top 20 marches on. Who will be the number one album of 2016?

Consider this lot special fried gold. Grilled silk. Battered platinum.There’s a word I saw used in a review of Ital Tek’s fifth album: “maximalism”. That refers to a day-glo Rustie gloss in which everything is turned up to 92. I think we need a new word for Hollowed, though. Maximum ambient. \"Maximbient\"? \"Ambimum\"?Alan ‘Ital Tek’ Myson (first mentioned here in 2008) tried to rediscover his teenage muse, when his sonic ramblings ran free and wild. As a result, Hollowed is cut from “hours of drones, loops and textures.” Crikes. All I did in my teenage years was tape the top 40. Finger on pause button, trying to cut out Bruno Brookes’s waffling.The helicoptering Jenova, the fuzzy Clark-ish pulse of Beyond Sight, the snappy assault of Cobra: this is full of light and dark. Things build, crescendo, fall, and tear another glorious hole in your ears. But it's in those between moments, when the static hangs in the air, that the ambimum thrills most. Yeah. Maybe not \"ambimum\". \"Ambaximent\"?!Hollowed by Ital TekScroll all of the best 2016 electronic albums by clicking here.6 – Ulrich Schnauss – No Further Ahead Than Today (Scripted Realities)When I reviewed this for Electronic Sound, I used words like “sweet” and “saccharine” and “sugar”. I think Mojo likened this to being “like being dosed up with dopamine.” Too much for repeated visits, right? Yet here it is in the top 10 for 2016.This is the Christmas cake stuck between your teeth. It’s the cheese selection sitting in your belly. It’s every sweet thing that has ever existed. Singing, chord changes, epic swell after epic swell, the perkiest keyboards under the sun. Oh my. I need a lie down.With A Strangely Isolated Place and Goodbye behind Ulrich Schnauss, this feels like a late-career album. After all, he’s got Tangerine Dream to concentrate on now. Even more impressive then that No Further Ahead Than Today is so technicolour, so smorgasbord, so... everything. And I love it.Scroll all of the best 2016 electronic albums by clicking here.We're not too far from number one, so let's kill off a few more giants.I really didn't take to The Avalanches comeback album Wildflower  (XL Recordings). Way too \"kooky\" mainstream. And I don't know what Tricky was up to on Skilled Mechanics (False Idols). Oh dear. Let's move on.I have endless love for Paul Hartnoll but his collaboration with Vince Clark on 2Square (Very Records) was a bit dad-pop in places. Meanwhile, Romare tend to be a little too straight down the line for me, no more so than on Love Songs: Part Two (Ninja Tune). That's also the case with Tycho, whose Epoch (Ghostly International) is as robustly satisfying as Coldplay. Sometimes albums are great but perhaps don't fit my narrow definition of electronic albums. That goes for the much-lauded and utterly fantastic Anohni's Hopelessness (Rough Trade) and for Jenny Hval's thoughful and engrossing Blood Bitch (Sacred Bones Records).Finally, a couple of miscellaneous names that didn't make the final selection but are probably worth a nosey. Steve Hauschildt's new agey Strands (Kranky) and the whimsical electronic pop of Motion Graphics (Domino) by Motion Graphics. The latter has a track called Minecraft Mosaic.Scroll all of the best 2016 electronic albums by clicking here.7 – Babyfather – BBF Hosted By DJ Escrow (Hyperdub)The bleak urban shadows of BBF could be overwhelming: drug dealers, police sirens, relationship breakdowns. “Trust is a luxury I can’t afford.” Oof. This is possibly the most 2016-sounding album amid our terrifying new reality of the far right, Trump, and Bake Off moving to Channel 4.Thankfully, the execution here is excellent. It’s recorded like a pirate radio station, and is presented by DJ Escrow, a presumably fictional MC with a funny line in chatter and plenty of problems to bang on about. It has the best line about Wiley that’s not on a Wiley record.The genius behind Babyfather seems to be Dean Blunt, the trickster who this year tried to sell cheese-filled toy cars on Ebay. It wasn’t cheese. The clue’s in his name. Whatever he’s been toking, this Union Flag-emblazoned joint is as disorienting and rewarding as they come.Babyfather - BBF Hosted by DJ Escrow (HDBLP032) by BabyfatherScroll all of the best 2016 electronic albums by clicking here."},

It’s album-y enough to be here. See this dictionary? See this shredder? I’m feeding this dictionary into this shredder and you can’t stop—dammit, the shredder’s jammed.I don’t know an awful lot about Acronym. Swedish chap, made his name on the Northern Electronics label, now back on the label he first started with. I once complimented him on his “gloopy intensity”, which I hope he didn’t take too personally. It’s just the way he walks.Entagled In Vines is a thuddering hypnodrone that keeps your legs endurance-dancing beyond four in the morning.

Here are some strange, experimental albums that didn’t make the final cut.For example, Elysia Crampton’s critically acclaimed Demon City (Break World Records), which was deeply unsettling in a pleasing, genre-bending way. Maybe it was all that demonic laughter she kept dropping in. No, really.I think I called Antwood’s Virtuous.scr (Planet Mu) “throbbing innards” for Electronic Sound. But in a good way. There’s also the twisted grime of WWWINGS’s PHOENIXXX (Planet Mu). If you want sparse, try the angry Fatima Al Qadiri’s Brute (Hyperdub) or Lucy’s industrial Self Mythology (Stroboscopic Artefacts).I’m not meant to be covering compilations, but the throbbing Durban breaks of Gqom Oh! (GQOM OH) scared the life out of me. As did the crumbling white noise of Ceramic TL’s Sign Of The Cross Every Mile To The Border (Halocline Trance).Finally, the legend that is Roly Porter was back with some classical noise on Third Law (Tri Angle), there was a mega triple bashment LP from (deep breath) Alix Perez, Chimpo, Fixate, Fracture, Om Unit, Sam Binga and Stray (phew) in the shape of Who Is Richie Brains (Exit Records).Oh and I have to mention the debut album just out from Seattle’s Homemade Weapons.

Two of the bestest modern ambient albums of all time (76:14 and Remotion), the man behind Shaft's Roobarb & Custard (yep!) and Harmonic 313, and now this stunning breakthrough– his first solo album as actual real-life Mark Pritchard.As Under The Sun spreads its Boards of Canada and Eno-isms thinly across a neverending horizon, sometimes it seems we’re caught in a trippy Wicker Man alternative reality, all English gardens and ‘70s haze and folk songs. Space flutes. Quivering organs.Is there anything this man can’t do? Astronauting, maybe. Fine art. Advanced haberdashery. Deep sea oil exploration. Dog surgery. I’m sure he can’t do any of these.

Yay, we made it!My Autechre radar first went off around patten two years ago when their last album ESTOILE NAIANT turned heads. On Ψ (psi), they’ve tightened up everything. Now it sounds like early Autechre made for the dang dancefloor. Well. Maybe the basement below the dancefloor.Hark: the stark percussion of Sonne; the footwork claustrophobia of Blade or Epsilon; the ambient chords washing underneath Used to b, the broken melancholia of Cache, with its Nintendo bleeps trying to break through the track.This is a refreshed patten, boosted no end by the monotone mutterings of new member A. Yep, they comprise two lettered people: he's called D, she's called A. With her vocals never far away and yet as distant as Alpha Centauri, this cold techno sounds strangely warm. Their live visuals are reportedly breaking new ground: there's evidence here that their audio is too.Watch the video for the brilliant Sonne by clicking here.Scroll all of the best 2016 electronic albums by clicking here.Here are some more also-rans. A bit more of a house music flavour amid the techno this time, so four to the floor, here goes…Just missing out on my final list is the fifth album from The Field. The Follower (Kompakt) is a splendid assembly of spiralling techno. Gold Panda is always a nice listen, so the travel-inspired Good Luck And Do Your Best (City Slang) didn’t disappoint.I enjoyed Juan Atkins & Moritz von Oswald / Borderland's Transport (Tresor) for two reasons: firstly, its unwavering commitment to solid house music, and secondly because I managed to shoehorn a C+C Music Factory reference into an Electronic Sound review of them earlier this year.I enjoyed his debut Workshop 19, so it was a welcome return for abstract technoist Kassem Mosse with Disclosure (Honest Jon's Records). Meanwhile, Matt Karmil released two albums of note: the dubby IDLE033 (Idle Hands) followed by the throbbing gritty house of ++++ (PNN). I preferred the latter. The dark, spacey Planet 4 (Prime Numbers) by Manchester’s own Trus'me is worth a look in too.House Of Dad’s House Of Dad (House Of Dad) samples a toilet flush and has a loo seat on the cover. It’s much better than it sounds, honest. Finally, there were the deep, otherworldly rhythms of Dorisburg’s Irrbloss (Hivern Discs), and, for those with a bit of time on their hands, you should check out Prince Of Denmark’s magical and engaging 23-track 8 (Forum) if you can find anywhere selling it.Scroll all of the best 2016 electronic albums by clicking here.11 – Autechre – elseq 1-5 (Warp Records)The godfathers of difficult techno Autechre could not be outdone by Aphex Twin, who’s been vomming out tracks like a cat in the hairball Olympics. So here we are: a mega five-album release to top Autechre’s 129-minute Exai from 2013. Quantity is now king.Even when they sounded nice, Autechre were awkward: for example, track seven on their 1994 album Amber is called Nine. So while this is unlikely to return X Factor to its long-lost Christmas number one dominance (PLEASE enter X Factor, Autechre), once you hook into Ae's advanced noise, so much makes sense.elseq is quite quaffable. c16 deep tread is hip hop covered in floor fluff. The slow-paced pendulu casual is Massive Attack caught in the middle of a sneeze. The resonating harmonics of the 24-minute mesh cinereaL are Mariah Carey in a faulty tumble dryer. Difficult? No. A development. And a Rochdale duo at the top of their game.Stream the album here.Scroll all of the best 2016 electronic albums by clicking here.12 – Lone –  Levitate (R&S Records)“I’d try to go to sleep and I’d be hearing these mad rave tunes form in my head,” said Matt ‘Lone’ Cutler of the fever that inspired his second album for R&S. Echoes of Aphex Twin’s apocryphal lucid dreaming stories?In any case, this lush technoist has turned hardcore.Levitate is his junglist hymn to Good Looking Records and Goldie, to the softer end of Stu Allen warehouse raves, to a time when clubbing was easy, messy and devoid of big name brands maxing out the price of a pint. I can smell the sun-drenched weed between the beats.I get the impression he doesn’t spend long in the studio. These are quick cuts where the rhythm is locked in: more colour than depth. The junglism is a welcome twist, but the core is still the same. And as long as he holds onto the lush 808 State-isms that are on display beautifully here, Cutler will keep returning to my top album lists.Scroll all of the best 2016 electronic albums by clicking here."},
{"title": "Also-rans: techno tryers making all the right noises", "date": "Dec 28, 2016", "text": "Still awake?Not all techno can make it into my final list: it’s the taking part that counts, right? Here are some more also-rans as we count down the best electronic music of 2016.Maybe I should have given more time to the sonic harsh-tronics of Andy Stott’s Too Many Voices (Modern Love), him being a former chart-topper round these parts. There was also some storming techno from A Made Up Sound’s A Made Up Sound (A Made Up Sound) – band, album and label nicely uniform there. Thug Entrancer moved from footwork to acid on the likeable Arcology (Software), and JK Flesh moved my bowels with the dirty jackhammer techno of Rise Above (Electric Deluxe).One of my most listened albums of this year was Death In Vegas’s 1997 album Dead Elvis. Which is a shame because it overshadowed his comeback album Transmission (Drone). It didn’t quite transmit enough for me.I enjoyed the paddy techno of Roman Flügel’s All The Right Noises (Dial Records). Prolific Icelander Bjarki put out three techno collections on the Trip Label: too much for me to absorb for this list. And I liked Abstract Division’s dancefloor-ripping Contemporary Spaces (Dynamic Reflection). This was technically an EP but it felt very much album-esque. An excuse I will use again, controversially, later on in this album countdown…Scroll all of the best 2016 electronic albums by clicking here.13 – Kowton – Utility (Livity Sound)When Joe ‘Kowton’ Cowton shook off the grimier elements of his sound, he was probably going against the grain. Instead of kowtowing (see what I did there) to the bass-crushing street sound scene, he produced Utility: put simply, an album no-frills techno.This ain’t clever: no Snares McSnareface tomfoolery here. Get a basic loop, throw in some percussion, let the machines do the work. The sound is not varied: indeed album highlight Loops 1 could be a remix of album highlight Some Cats.But that’s the charm. It’s simple and it positively zings out of the speakers, I remember listening to Drum Club back in the day. They weren’t afraid to let a mechanical bass drum sit on its own, thwum thwum, pacing in isolation. A drum pad for the sake of a drum pad. I’m shivering just thinking about it.

I was told to call at 2pm. “Miaow.” Great. Thanks for agreeing to speak to me, Thom. And congratulations on making my top 20. “Miaow.” So kind of you to say, Thom. If you had a blog, I’d read it too. “Miaow.”You’re in this list because Radiohead have been an electronic music band since the turn of the millennium. That time you guys rocked a Kaoss pad on the Amnesiac tour. Can you talk me through your process? “Miaow. Miiiaaaoow.” Amazing. And here we are in 2016 with one of our most listenable albums for ages. “Miaow.” No, thank YOU.A Moon Shaped Pool is a beautiful work. Less dense somehow. There’s not much more I can say that hasn’t been said in a million column inches elsewhere, hence this phone call. “Miaow.” You keep saying miaow.

It just ended up in this also-rans section of my 2016 countdown.Just because I preferred Pye Corner Audio to Kyle Dixon & Michael Stein’s Stranger Things (Lakeshore Records), it didn’t stop that programme and its soundtrack being a glorious highlight of 2016. Alas, not in my final list though.There are plenty more ambient works that didn’t make the top 20. COW / Chill Out, World! (Kompakt) saw The Orb at their most floaty, while Sir Brian of Eno spiced up a Velvet Undeground cover with the voice of Peter Serafinowicz on The Ship (Warp Records). Yes, you read that right.Clark’s The Last Panthers (Warp Records) seemed dark and interesting, but it was soundtracking a TV series I hadn’t seen. Brooklyn’s Julianna Barwick spooked us with Will (Dead Oceans), clearly taking some of her inspiration from Oneohtrix Point Never.Digging down into the experimental bucket, I have three final ambient works to mention. Norway’s greatest export Biosphere used Ukrainian and Polish folk music on Departed Glories (Smalltown Supersound). Black Merlin trekked to some far off places for the field recordings on Hipnotik Tradisi (Island Of The Gods). And Crotaphytus’s Acanthosaura (Further Records) came across as some kind of ketamine Planet Earth.Departed Glories by BiosphereScroll all of the best 2016 electronic albums by clicking here.15 – Pye Corner Audio – Stasis (Ghost Box)The Stasis artwork contained quotes from Ursula K Le Guin and Arthur C Clarke. This is perhaps a red herring, because this isn’t a blast to some robot-led future with cars made out of physics and that. Nope. This is a whoosh into the past. Mr Pye, as I’m now going to call Martin Jenkins, is an utter synth-head. That love for old gear shines on this album – and indeed in his other alias Head Technician. He takes his inspiration from John Carpenter; from the kind of horror films that have informed electronic music for years.The fact that Adam Curtis uses Mr Pye’s music in his documentaries didn’t swing this for me. Nor the fact he supported Mogwai. Nope. Stasis is here because it’s what the Stranger Things soundtrack could have been. It’s that much of a whoosh into the past. And it sounds great.Scroll all of the best 2016 electronic albums by clicking here.16 – James Blake – The Colour In Anything (Universal Music)The curse of the Mercury Prize. You know how it goes. Whoever wins is confined to a cellar for the rest of their career, never to be seen again. This is James Blake’s first album since he bagged the award in 2013. Uh oh. Down you go, Blakey, into the darkness.Getting a more famous Blake to do his cover of The Colour In Anything was a smart move. Yep, this is work of Quentin. Although James still sounds like an adorably sulky teenager, he's fattened up his sound. He even worked with Rick ‘Def Jam’ Rubin on the production.Which is the key, really, It’s never all about the voice for me. Listen to the urgent ringing alarm that slices Radio Silence (listen below) in two. The shattered shakes of Modern Soul’s percussion. The fuzzed brass of Timeless. There’s more going on with post-Mercury Blakey. If he is confined to a cellar of obscurity, he’s sure making a lot of lovely sound.Scroll all of the best 2016 electronic albums by clicking here.Here are more people that didn't reach my final list.If you spot holes in this top 20, that’s because some big names are missing. For example, you won’t find Katy B’s Honey (Rinse Recordings) because my usual listen-holes weren't streaming it. Or how about DJ Shadow’s The Mountain Will Fall (Mass Appeal), absent for an entirely different reason. That reason being: a snoozesome meh.It was a shame not to include Loop the Loop (DEEK) by Bullion with its slices of scrumptious melody. Same for Bibio’s A Mineral Love (Warp Records) who are sounding more than ever like the BeeGees. I also appreciated The Gamble (R&S Records), an addictive noodly number from nonkeen.And finally some miscellaneous treats for this particular also-rans section – yep, more of these to come. Have a listen to the retro techno disco of Prins Thomas’s Principe Del Norte (Smalltown Supersound), the playful electro of Letherette’s Last Night On The Planet (Ninja Tune), the post-punky Sport (XL Recordings) by Powell, and the one-off pop oddity that is Nicolas Jaar's Sirens (Other People).There you go.

No, you haven’t walked into the middle of a conversation: that’s my favourite track title from the latest album from the chaotic king of drill ‘n’ bass. Cue joke about “check mating” for life. Getting caught on pawn sites. Bashing bishops?Snares used modular synthesis to record Traditional Synthesizer Music. That’s where you patch together a bunch of units, wires draped everywhere like spaghetti Mechano. The track below will give you an idea of what that looks like. There he is, smoking away. Bless.Snares McSnareface has let it all hang out, mostly. The album may meander a little, but it’s surprisingly listenable and is perhaps closer to his Last Step alias.

I learned gaming with Spectrums and the original Playstation. With a dual controller, my avatars crash into walls and walk on people’s faces.

Surely, Floorplan’s Robert Hood was an influence on Bookworms’ warming Xenophobe (BANK Records NYC).Pantha Du Prince made his comeback on The Triad (Rough Trade), with all the tinkling electronics you’d expect. The horrendously-named Convextion made techno feel spacey on 2845 (a.r.t.less). Meanwhile, the co-founder of Hessle Audio released the sparky In Drum Play under the name Pangaea on his own label – and did a good job of it. Top Japanese DJ Fumiya Tanaka appeared after a long album absence with You Find The Key (Perlon): he kept the jazzier elements under control, unlike Kornél Kovács’ The Bells (Studio Barnhus). Sorry, Korny, a little too corny. And there was an old-school feel to Omar S’s Detroitian The Best! (FXHE Records). Honestly, Mr S, you can’t call your album The Best and expect to be in the top 20.

James Hinton’s evocative Potential is one of two albums in this top 20 that sheds light on urban unease. He plundered audio from YouTube like a low-bitrate Snowden, then polished the roughness to produce pieces that are not only pleasing to the lug-holes: they’re also strangely familiar.Familiar because there’s nothing ground-breaking here. He’s toured with Chvrches, which should give you an idea of the melody at play. This is solid soundtrack stuff. The BBC should, in turn, be plundering this for trailer music.But this is also familiar because Potential is built from the stories of YouTube creators.

The only one that matters. That's right... it's time for the ugliest pandas of 2016.No, wait.It's time for my top best favouritest electronic albums of 2016. This is my annual countdown of the long-players that have lured my earlobes throughout this most lurid of years. And although I probably write with some authority on the subject having scrawled many words about this kind of gubbins, I guess I should give some disclaimers.Firstly, this list is not definitive. I've expanded it to a top 20 this year, and there will be another 90-or-so albums that will get the slightest of mentions. That's a lot of mentions. But I looked in an encyclopedia which said there were 32 billion albums released every day in 2016, so I'm going to miss stuff.Secondly, I'll get things wrong. Opinion is not a static state. I look back on my previous lists (2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009) and curse the day Vengaboys didn't win every single one. I may even edit these blog posts in the days to come. Just drop in a jpeg of the Vengabus or something.Thirdly, I've missed out compilations. Sorry, Objekt (Kern Vol 3), the immense #savefabric or Houndstooth's impressive Tessellations.I'm also not bothered about things in the charts that much, even though I've actually bought real life actual concert tickets for Take That, Kylie and Clean Bandit in the past.

Follow me on Twitter, where I'll welcome your responses and mentions. If you like a blog post, stick a link on your timeline - that's why I do this: to get more people listening to good noises.

You can see the original, but I have included much of its text here in italics.\"There are many things I should have resisted.An invitation to Ara, Manchester's leading goth night. I arrive dressed in white. A hundred six-foot black and purple people, some of them dressed as crows, don sunglasses.\"Indeed, my mate is still running that goth night. And yes, I did dress in white. Although I feel a natural connection with 'alternative' cultures, I'm not gothy. I might dress in black, but I'd happily live in a day-glo world in bright sunlight. If I was a vampire, I'd have been dust a long time ago.I go on to mention a number of trivial disasters. The \"record company showcase\" where I spilled MC Tunes's pint did indeed feature All Saints a long time before they were packaged for final launch. And yes, I bought the Kooks album.\"What was I thinking? It makes me sick to even think of it. I gave the CD away in a tombola at my 33-and-a-third birthday bash.\"That bash was nearly ten years ago. It was my 33 and a third birthday party, with all sorts of themes relating to thirds. We had a tombola with 33.33 prizes (the fractional prize being part of a chocolate bar).\"Getting my ears pierced in a strange attempt to cure a throbbing hangover.\" This was when I was trying to be trendy and Afflecks Palace-y. My traditional androgynophobic boss at the time nearly fired me.\"Sledging with £1,300 in my back pockets.\" Yep. Actually happened. A long line of £50 notes drying on radiators.\"There are many things I should have resisted. However, there is one thing I have resisted, but should have given in to quite some time ago.Yes. I am finally on Last FM.\"And that's the point of that blog post. Didn't see that coming, did you.

It was like walking into a shisha pipe, only with a sillhouette of an MC rising out of the cloud. I'd got a load of vinyl, but it was the first time I'd seen \"liquid beats\" (ugh) in a live setting.Here's a remix of LTJ Bukem's classic track Music. It's just a clip (full version here), but this is the kind of loveliness I walked into.For those not used to this kind of drum 'n' bass, you need to get over the busy-ness of the beat. It is, after all, running at 175BPM which is enough to leave your rattled bones scattered over the dancefloor. Let the loop become one. And then lose yourself in the chords swirling around the centre.Despite the likes of Rudimental hooking up with Ed Sheeran to bring a clunkier - yet still entertaining - form of this music to the Hozier generation, the genre has stayed pleasantly underground. Yeah, there was that Olive track a generation ago, and that woman totally addicted to bass. But really...But the smoky, airy Bukem stuff remains fairly pure. And, when done well, absolutely one of the most liberating styles of music alongside acid house.A particular favourite of mine was Big Bud. a regular on Progression Sessions and someone whose sound seemed to cut a little deeper. Listen to High Times below.I like cats. I like drum 'n' bass. Maybe there's a corrolation between the weed-hazed jungle ambience and a domesticated jungle cat that sleeps 22 hours a day.Maybe this, and exactly this, is what cats hear in their head all the time.Further Fats: Bleep Years day nineteen - LTJ Bukem's Horizons (2012) Further Fats: The precarious future of Ed Sheeran's Thinking Out Loud (2016)"},

Michael flipping Buble.They aren't even the most successful Michaels. They're eclipsed by Jackson and George. But it's not that which riles me.It's 2016, not 1927. These five folks date back to the time we used pagers for social reasons. Back to the time dial-up internet meant you had to write to Readers Digest to request your ration of bytes. Back when we brushed our teeth with chimney sweep brushes. If you could afford teeth.Alright, old fogeys probably sell better in the lead-up to Christmas. No record company's going to risk losing the next new thing in the swamp of seasonal sales. I bet the best-selling things in pound shops right now are carriage clocks, denture glue and snuff.But there's definitely a domination of physical product here. Boil the chart down to just streams, and instead the top five is Drake, James Arthur, Justin Biebpipe, Ed Sheeran and Kanye. Much fresher blood. So what we're seeing in the current album chart are strong old-school Adele-style sales of supermarket CDs.In short, streaming is dead, old people are alive, and Michael Buble is definitely not the most successful Michael in town.I wish the chutes thing was true.Further Fats: Here is the latest pop chart, apparently (2014)"},

An actual tent. With, er, slamminess in.

Machine Cut Noise is their latest album and I'm pleased to say it hits like a boxer and stings like a butterfly with bees sellotaped on. My favourite track is Viginti Quinque, which is Latinate nod to the age of the Soma label. Here's an excerpt, a word which, incidentally, is from the Latin \"to pluck\":Just beautiful. But you want longer stuff than that, don't you? Here's the unrelenting Psalm, a word which is co-incidentally from the Greek \"to pluck\".Why am I talking linguistics? I blame Arrival.Psalm is a little basic in melodic themes but pretty much sets you up for the album. In the Soundcloud comments, someone uses the phrase \"fanny baws\".

{"title": "Thinking about winter", "date": "Sep 22, 2016", "text": "I like the summer. I'm a Leo. Not that star signs mean anything, but lions are good (tigers are better) and the sun is a Leo thing. I think: I had a mug once with all the symbols on. Anyway, I like the summer.I also like the cold. Well. The cool. 17 degrees is my favourite temperature. I also love snow because it's pretty and covers all those ugly plants, trees and birds. If snow was made of sun, it would probably average out at 17 degrees. That's Celsius by the way, I'm not mad.But what I really don't like is the dark. Not that I have that SAD thing, but my mood is definitely affected by all the good sun chemicals. Which is why the impending winter holds a bit of trepidation for me. And I positively detest Christmas, a festival which can cucoon families and hold up traditions in ways that aren't great for us outsider types.However, I don't have to let the winter get to me. That's a CBT thing, right? Think about things differently. I need to make a promise as the seasons move away from happy sunny lion time. Here is that promise:When I open my curtains to an autumnal trudgeful of murk, instead of thinking about the damp and the dark, I'm GOING TO PRETEND I'M INSIDE A BIG CAKE.A big lovely cake. That's why it's dark. I'm inside a humongous cake. Simple!One day I will burst out and sing happy birthday to someone, or perhaps a huge knife will tear the cake sky asunder, but for now I am inside a lovely, lovely cake.I mean. I don't really like cake. It's pretentious, not like biscuits. And cake reminds me of weddings which, by and large, aren't really my thing. And tigers don't eat cake, which is a significant problem.But. Yeah. The cake thing. Stupid cakes. No, this isn't going to work. Bah. If you have any tips on being happier in the winter, please write them on a postcard."},

No really, it was used in Sex And The City.Apparently that's Norfolk in the video. If you squint hard enough, you can see famous musicians from Norfolk such as Nathan Fake, Beth Orton and (if you count American Norfolks) Gene Vincent.Incidentally, Dan Tombs does pleeeenty good bands.

In order. One, two, three, and so on. It's a fantasy because I'd find it impossible. However, a potential contender would be a bitey little trance track from 1992 called Spring Yard.You can listen to Spring Yard below if you want.The artist is CJ Bolland whose crossover 1996 hit Sugar Is Sweeter was a perfect pick-me-up for Prodigy fans. Before that, in his pre-Polygram days, Bolland was in no mood to hit the charts. Indeed, the R&S album The 4th Sign was a glorious collection of stampeding trance music - the kind of stuff us young beat-heads were listening to while everyone else thought techno was 2 Unlimited.Bolland was melodic too: stand-out track Camargue was pure, sweet Belgian techno. Indeed I could pick any track off The 4th Sign, but Spring Yard was the one that scared me. That's right. Scared. It was a ferocious number that threatened to destroy my speakers. It taught me - warned me - that techno had no bounds. And although the strings sound a little clunky now, the track was also beautiful.This alongside Sven Väth's similarly throbbing Accident In Paradise? Definitely in my top ten. Or twenty. Maybe. I don't know. See - totally impossible.And for reference:Further Fats: Chosen Words: V is for Väth"},

Don't worry though: Mala's Mirrors is an album of tribal bass music rather than easy-listening chillout instrumentals, and the pipes on opening track Kotos sit nicely alongside the RP Boo-isms of the rhythm track.Mirrors is full of samples from Mala's wanderings in Peru.

This is just a music blog. You don't come here for politics.It has never occurred to me to be anti-European. Without the Trance Europe Express compilation series, I'd be lost. I'm a child of Kraftwerk and Belgian techno and Cafe Del Mar and bands with exotic French-sounding names like Autechre.I'm finding solace by switching off the internet and listening to music. Good European music. I suggest you do the same.Here's Belgian EBM outfit Front 242 with their 1988 track Headhunter (below). The Europe of this video seems ever distant now. Mainly because we've smeared our vision with hairballs. Big stinky hairballs. And by hairballs, I mean Michael Gove's pubic hair and Boris Johnson's balls.Look at the architecture below.

I know, right? This is a big moment.The track is called CIRKLON3 [ Колхозная mix ]: it's from his Cheetah EP and it's a corker. To see the video, click those links you just read past.The video is basically a lo-fi danceathon and it's directed by 12-year-old Ryan Wyer. Ryan was chosen as director after Mr Twin saw his fan video for comeback single minipops 67 [120.2][source field mix], which was all kinds of strange aceness.Here, in no particular order, are the bits I enjoyed most when I first watched video rather too loudly at work. It's now on repeat.1 - Hey, it's that lad from the Minipops video! And hey look at the t-shirt!Honestly, it was a real \"hey, Aphex really GETS the internet moment\".2 - The beach that reminded me of the On video and made me go all fuzzy inside.Which is nice because there's something of the early Aphex about the glowing chords that light up this whole flipping track.3 - This proper boss move with the hands.I tried this but I fell over.4 - The reveal of the mask... aaaargh... I'm never going outside again.Another \"aaah, we're back in Aphexland\" moment. If Aphex Twin ever stops smiling, all music will end. This is a fact.5 - The most sinister and/or coolest DJ in the universe.If you google 'find edges', you'll spot this filter in use right across the internet - but none of them make someone's face as toothily chilling as this.6 - This awesome cartwheel.I tried this but I fell over.7 - This 'cute' buddy moment that scared the pants off me but was still kinda sweet.From one Aphex-head to another, nice work, Ryan.Further Fats: Come on my Selected (2006)"},
{"title": "Do we really want Vengaboys in our room (boom boom boom boom)?", "date": "Jun 20, 2016", "text": "According to Twitter, which is place where all the news is kept these days, today is the anniversary of Vengaboys topping the UK chart with - and let me get the punctuation right - Boom,Boom,Boom,Boom!!On this day in 1999, the VengaBoys hit the #1 spot on the UK singles chart with 'Boom Boom Boom Boom’. #90s pic.twitter.com/LzJ1OAtopg— The 90s (@The90sDiary) June 20, 2016Which rasies an obvious question. Of all the \"Boom\" number one singles, how successful is that Vengaboys hit?Let's do some point scoring.There are five number one singles with \"boom\" in the title. In alphabetical order of artist, they are:Black Eyed Peas - Boom Boom Pow (2009)DJ Jazzy Jeff And The Fresh Prince - Boom! Shake The Room (1993)Outhere Brothers - Boom Boom Boom (1995)Shaggy - Boombastic (1995)Vengaboys - Boom,Boom,Boom,Boom!! (1999)So these are our contenders. All quality tracks, I'm sure you'll agree.And now the maths. There are three ways to rate these singles by success: the charts, streaming and popular opinion. In each of these three categories, I will score each single five, four, three, two or one Boom Points, or an average of points if they are tied. The one with the most Boom Points (BPs) wins.Let's go.1. Chart successFirstly, I will look at their original chart run: how long they were at number one, and in the case of a tie, how many weeks they spent in the top 100.Outhere Brothers get a slam dunk here. They spent four weeks at UK number one. Yeah, amazing, I know. Black Eyed Peas and Jazzy Jeff both spent two weeks at number one for their Boom singles, but the Peas had two more weeks on chart, so the Peas nudge into second place. Joint last are Shaggy and Vengaboys, who spent a single week at the top spot with 17 weeks each on chart.Chart success results:Outhere Brothers 5 BPsBlack Eyed Peas 4 BPsJazzy Breath And The Fresh Mint 3 BPsShaggy 1.5 BPsVengaboys 1.5 BPs2. StreamingSecondly, I will check the number of current day streams: for this, I will simply note the number of total plays each track has on Spotify.Poor Outhere Brothers. Only 1.6 million listens. Not many people want to listen to a shaking room either: Jeff and his Fresh Prince pal only get 4.6 million listens. Vengaboys and Shaggy are very close: the vengabussers have 25.5 million streams at the time of writing, while Boombastic has 29.8 million streams. Bossing this category, however, is the much more contemporary Black Eyed Peas. They have 55.9 million streams and score top position in this category for Boom Boom Pow.Streaming results:Black Eyed Peas 5 BPsShaggy 4 BPsVengaboys 3 BPsJazzy Thingy And The Will Smith Bloke 2 BPsOuthere Brothers 1 BP3. Popular opinionThirdly and finally, I will turn to popular opinion: here, I will delve into the last ten (top) comments on YouTube and rate those comments for positivity. I'll include nostalgia as a positive thing because that's basically why YouTube exists.A lot of comments on the Black Eyed Peas' Boom Boom Pow video are spammers or attention grabbers. Someone is excited about seeing them again (\"aguardando ansiosamente o retorno desse grupo incrível<3﻿\") and there are two nice nostaglia comments: \"my my nostalgia﻿\" and \"velhos tempos, castanhari fez eu me lembra shsuahu﻿\". Three positive comments, then.The comments on Shaggy's Boombastic are mainly people that have clicked on the track due to commercials. All of those comments seem neutral, apart from one which says \"The Chase Bank commercial made me remember this fun song and that cute little pig\". They said the song was \"fun\". Therefore, that's one positive comment.﻿ Just. I have no idea who the pig is. Maybe it's Shaggy's DJ, blowing the house down with its cracklin' tunes.For the Vengaboys, it's all a little vague. One comment just says \"nostalgia\" while another one gives a little story about hearing this abroad then saying a nice thing about Dutch people: \"Ik houd van jullie, dutchies :P﻿\". I'll give this two positive comments.There are no positive comments on Boom Boom Boom by the Outhere Brothers. Someone's a little bit racist, another one's calling for it to be censored, while someone else says \"I tweeted 4 days ago that reggie and bollie should sing this on the x factor and they did tonight. Cheryl gave me no credit. Cry for me﻿\". Okay, maybe that is positive. Sort of. I'll put this joint last with Shaggy.People love DJ Jazzy Jeff And The Fresh Prince's Boom! Shake The Room. Hark ye the love of the YouTubers: \"this song never gets old woooo﻿\" / \"Haha it is 1993 again and I am nine years old again at the school disco.\" / \"Just one of those people that is good at everything. Well done Will Smith.﻿\" / \"I love Will Smith﻿\" / \"The stutter rap at 2:34 is genious﻿\". They're right - this track may well be genious﻿. Er. Genius. Clearly, Jazzy Jeff and his alien-fighting buddy are the winners of this category.Popular opinion results:Jazzy Jeffrey And The Get-Fresh Prancer 5 BPsBlack Eyed Peas 4 BPsVengaboys 3 BPsOuthere Brothers 1.5 BPsShaggy 1.5 BPsFinal resultsAt the start of this blog post (do you remember that?), I wanted to see how successful the awkwardly-punctuationed Boom,Boom,Boom,Boom!! by Vengaboys was in comparision to other tracks that have topped the charts with the word \"boom\" in the title.Here are the final scores:Black Eyed Peas - Boom Boom Pow (2009) 13 Boom Points - winner!DJ Jazzy Jeff And The Fresh Prince - Boom! Shake The Room (1993) 10 Boom PointsOuthere Brothers - Boom Boom Boom (1995) 7.5 Boom PointsVengaboys - Boom,Boom,Boom,Boom!! (1999) 7.5 Boom PointsShaggy - Boombastic (1995) 7 Boom PointsOh. In short, Vengaboys are almost half as bad as the Black Eyed Peas and only as good as the Outhere Brothers.Well that was a waste of an hour.Further Fats: Crimes against crimes against keyboards - Black Eyed Peas"},

There's something about the unity of clubbing that stretches across the generations.This blog exists because the dancefloor changed me. The thud thud of the bass drum is something you never quite get out of your system, and it infects the rest of your life's creativity: as it says in Dave Haslam's Life After Dark, \"the story doesn't end when the last customer leaves\".And so in an impotent effort of blog solidarity for those affected by the Pulse nightclub events, as well as posting my tweet from yesterday morning (below), I also post a picture (above) of the discotastic mirrorball I saw in a Canal Street bar after the vigil. I mean, I didn't dance last night. I was too busy taking pictures of mirrorballs. But you get my point.Gay clubs were a lifeline for me.

The track listing is as follows: CHEETAHT2 [Ld spectrum], CHEETAHT7b, CHEETA1b ms800, CHEETA2 ms800, CIRKLON3 [Колхозная mix], CIRKLON 1 and 2X202-ST5.

I spent ages sifting through their alarming quantities of Christian rock music to find the best clearance albums I could.The bargains I bought included Apollo 440, Dust Junkys, a whole bunch of Moby, Hardfloor, Bentley Rhythm Ace, Jam & Spoon, Fun-Da-Mental, and Dead Elvis by Death In Vegas. I felt I had bought the 1990s.That was a while back. Since then, it's Death In Vegas (DiV) I have played the most. Dead Elvis isn't perfect, but in the middle of the album is a triple-decker smashdown of Dirt, Rocco and Rekkit. This felt like the absolute height - and heart - of big beat.In 1997, I saw DiV support the Sneaker Pimps at Manchester University Student's Union. The Pimps bashed out their brace of hits, so note perfect that Six Underground might as well have been played on a tape. But support act DiV, with their debut album barely a few months old, tore the roof off the place. One of my happiest gig memories. The Pimps never stood a chance.DiV have a new album out called Transmission: it's very different, although you can hear the intensity of Rekkit on the towering second track Consequences Of Love.In the meantime, back to Dead Elvis and that dirty trio of 1990s techno perfection.

A flipping badge!Thank you, Skotchums, for sending me stuff. It pleases my ears.As I clutched the vinyl and cassette possessively like a hipster gollum, it reminded me of the time I bought Faith No More's Angel Dust on record, with its majestic beautiful gatefold sleeve design, alongside a cassette tape of The Orb's Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld. The two formats were my world back then. It must have been 1992. I played that Orb album to death on my walkman. Although that leads me to wonder: back in 1992 did I really (a) still have a cassette walkman and (b) not yet have a CD player? Really?Anyhoo, here comes Roland's Revenge from Ikea Crimejazz Vol 2.

{"title": "Big beat's gonna work it out, maybe, perhaps not", "date": "Apr 28, 2016", "text": "From grunge to g-funk, from trip hop to Brit pop, there’s one thing you can be sure of about the 1990s: the one forgotten genre might be big beat.Everyone knows the artists. The Chemical (Dust) Brothers blasted the roof off the place with Brother’s Gonna Work It Out, Fatboy Slim had a party in his head with Gangster Trippin and even if people don’t know the band name, they may well recognise Bentley Rhythm Ace (pictured).But as a name, I reckon there’ll be a lot of younger people who don’t know “big beat”. The label kinda got swallowed up by the cool Britannia thing. Or perhaps it shed its identity when it went massively mainstream: see the Prodigy’s Firestarter or The Propellorheads’ History Repeating.Maybe it just became known as video game music. Maybe, as Acid Ted suggests, it just got a bit embarrassing.Not that labels matter that much, but big beat acted as a useful curatorial guide when picking tracks in my early DJing days. For example, there was a great block rockin’ underground in the shape of Brassic Beats and Heavenly Social, with the likes of Req, Cut La Roc, Monkey Mafia and the Skint Records founder Midfield General.There’s a longer piece in this, and I may well pen something for Electronic Sound. In the meantime, to test my theory, I’m going to be shaking teenagers by the shoulders until they name all the 1990s music styles.Who knew “let go of me, Fats, you idiot” was a genre?"},

Even if I do say so myself! https://t.co/kW9pKv726t— Paul Hartnoll (@paulhartnoll858) April 15, 2016The Box was a single from Orbital's fourth album In Sides. The band had transformed themselves from club-storming Chimers into paranoid techno charmers via their third album Snivilisation. Think Brian Blessed turning into Jeff Goldblum.In Sides was full of fear and joy of a technological utopia. But The Box was different. It was nestled between the snarling machines of PETROL and the sinister choir of Dwr Budr. The Box's use of harpsichord and brushy shares made it feel antique, as if it were carved from old wood.Indeed, we heard the titular container creak open, Hammer-style (horror not MC). We're pretty sure we know who was inside - hey, look, it's the amazing pre-Oscars Tilda Swinton.The best thing about The Box, was the epic 12\", lasting over 20 minutes: a four-part odyssey that was ambitious, frightening and strangely moving. What is the box? Who opened it? And why do I keep thinking of coffins?Have a listen to the full, er, Box set below. Even better, track down the vinyl.

As you can see in this Official Charts tracker (below), it debuted at number 26, took over four months to get to number one, and then just would not go away.But look at the current week, highlighted in pink (click pic for bigger). It's dropped to 100.What happens when it drops out? Do the charts lose their strength, like Samson getting a buzz cut? Does someone somewhere stop playing bingo? What happens when we reach number 100 in our own lives; is Ed Sheeran a metaphor for human existence?Ed (frightened eyes, pictured at the top of this devastating exposé) has one saving grace: a statistical anomaly. In this week's chart, Kanye West scored nine new entries. Nine. For now, the battle is between Sheeran fans constantly buying Thinking Out Loud on CD, and Kanye fans streaming his album tracks on the backs of buses.Who will win? Leave a comment under this-- actually, don't bother.(11th June 2016 update: The single hung on for one more week, then dropped out of the charts.

If you want a visual representation if the kind of words I write for them, click through here. That amazingly dark image is broken down here by illustrator Steve Appleton.While the nights are ugly and the clouds all leaky, I've been staying in more. Recharging my batteries. Still, I went to an enjoyable Speakeasy in Stretford, organised by my writing buddy Dave Hartley. And then there were the two spoken word nights I host: a memorable The Word in Didsbury and a gigglesome Bad Language in the city centre.I enjoyed my writing critique group in which a bunch of us tear apart each others' stories then sulk for ages. Actually, we're quite adult about it all, and only sixteen punches were thrown at our latest meeting.I went to the cinema more. Spielberg's Bridge of Spies was a sold historical drama, although I wish he would lay off the sentimentality. There was a great living room scene in which something surprising happened (no spoiler) and he demonstrated his ability to tell an incident as a story-in-microcosm with a series of expertly controlled camera angles; he's still a genius. I enjoyed The Revenant despite it being very much like this Simpson's scene. I'm not as smitten with it as other people, though - there were at least two Revenant moments that were way too Oscar-worthy to be taken seriously. Neither of these films were as good as Room, an extraordinary film about childhood resilience by one of my favourite directors.

Increasingly, I find my energy levels to be a finite resource - particularly after a year of higher-profile performances. So why waste that energy on the fallout from oversharing, or from repeats of that famous 'someone on the internet is wrong' XKCD cartoon?The promise came as a little mantra:> my internet is an echo chamber;> if in doubt, stay positive - or silly;> if my first reaction is annoyance then back off;> always ask \"is this my battle?\"Wow, the comments I have deleted mid-draft as a result of that...

{"title": "Best electronic albums of 2015: one", "date": "Dec 31, 2015", "text": "The road up until this point is a painful one. A story of my own failure. In 2010, I failed to give Luke Abbott the album of the year despite it clearly being the album that most moved me and made me trill with excitement for the future of music. In 2014, I yet again let my head rule my heart and I relegated Clark and Kiasmos despite either one deserving the number one position. The road up until this point is, frankly, a shambles.In 2015, right here, right now, I will atone for my mistakes by making an utterly heart-felt decision. This year’s number one album is the one that thrilled me, that sent my belly a-quiver, that made me do a little poop in my head with terror: this year’s number one album is Dumb Flesh by Blanck Mass.1 – Blanck Mass – Dumb Flesh (Sacred Bones Records)Blanck Mass is Benjamin John Power from F*ck Buttons (excuse the blog filter asterisk) and this does indeed sound like a development of their Slow Focus album. Dumb Flesh starts with the loping reversed vocal of Loam before exploding into the throbbing electro workout of Dead Format, complete with hand-clap snares. We're talking full-on overblown. No Lite is more careful to begin with, stacking things up over a ten minute period as it peaks in bleeping triumph as the beat refuses to relent.The first twenty minutes done, with the listener exhausted, the album tones things down. The toe-tapping Atrophies follows a simple theme: slow and considered. The moody Cruel Sport can't hold it in though, and it allows in the epic chords that greeted us earlier in the album: a central theme that makes Dumb Flesh greater than the sum of its fatty parts.Double Cross is almost electro-pop, and even allows for a cheery fourth-bar snare fill. As with Atrophies, Lung allows for some breathing space (sorry) and a little creepy groaning for good measure. And then the final ten minutes: their masterpiece Detritus. We start amid scraping white noise that seems to last forever, and then... and then, swooping from the darkest recesses, the anthemnic organ-crashing ending promised by so much by that which came before.The industrial Front 242-isms referenced throughout are a little before my time: I can see why fellow journos a bit older than me are frothing at their mouths at this. But it has split opinion too, proving a little too one-note for many. The Observer said these \"bombastic modular synth symphonies owes more to Queen’s One Vision than it does to Kraftwerk’s Man Machine.” The Observer are idiots.What I hear in Dumb Flesh is a glorious energy, a broad-strokes sound that takes some getting used to, and the one album I have returned to most in 2015. I said this would be a heart-over-head decision, but maybe more than anything else, this is a head-trip: a body-physical album that leaves your emotions tearing along a few desperate steps behind.Thanks for reading my blog in 2015.

I know it's annoying doing individual blog posts, but you can look at the whole lot so far with one click:-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----Here are the last bucket of albums that got thrown in a skip instead of comprising my final top ten. The last of the rejects. And there are a few giants I'm about to kill...Hey! It's the Prodge! The Day Is My Enemy added an urban element to their ageing agitation: just more of the same, really, but quite fun. RP Boo was as lively as ever on Fingers, Bank Pads & Shoe Prints (Planet Mu), and perhaps a little darker. I'm afraid I've not had chance to give Grimes' Art Angel (4AD) the attention it deserves, although I've loved the bits I've heard. And Venetian Snares' reliably hardcore Your Face (Planet Mu) had some of his best moments for ages.Hunee's Hunch Music (Rush Hour Recordings) took electro and soul and bit it into house-size chunks. Howling's Sacred Ground (Monkeytown Records) placed delicate folk melodies over precise electronics - not necessarily a winner for me - while there were some chilled electronics worthy of your attention on Lapalux's Lustmore (Brainfeeder).Vito Ricci gave us I Was Crossing A Bridge (Music From Memory), a compilation of future-minded 1980s artistry, including the beautifully twisted disco of I'm At That Party Right Now. Scratchy Munich drum experiments was the order of the day on Zenker Brothers' Immersion (Music From Memory). I didn't much like the commercial house of BOOF's The Hydrangeas Whisper (Running Back). And the final sounds of this section are angry noise from Kerridge's Always Offended Never Ashamed (Contort Records) and broken mechanics from M.E.S.H.'s Piteous Gate (Pan).Edit: Lorn's dropped Vessel yesterday - way too late to give it any consideration. Consider this a free pass into next year's list.So that's it. Who's left? Can you guess. I'm proud of this number one. It's an album that moved me - perhaps physically more than emotionally. One more blog post to come: my favourite album of the year...-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----2 –  Jamie xx –  In Colour (Young Turks)At some point soon, Jamie xx is going to produce the Kooks covers album that’s going to ruin his career, but right now he’s just completed a perfect hat trick. His debut as The xx, his brilliant Gil Scott-Heron remix, and now this.Almost everything on In Colour could be a hit single. Here are the tracks in order: a crowd-pleasing synth ecstasy, a brisk house head-nodder, a spacious and haunting breakbeat track, steel drums with a smile, a suspenseful filler, a proper ace builder of a pop track, an all-out club banger, a smooth soul anthem, something that sounds like Black Eyed Peas, a whole heap of swirling sadness and a filmic closer that seems to tie the whole thing together.Admittedly he doesn’t break new ground, and there’ll be a whole load of balding paper-shufflers buying a CD to put on their coffee table or their tablet computer or whatever it is people put coffee on these days.But if you skip the Black Eyes Peas one, this is as perfect as it gets: the sound of a producer grabbing the past five years of electronic music and presenting it to us neatly wrapped and bowed. I score this xx out of xx. See what I did there? Cheers, thanks.-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----Another quick break to look at EVEN MORE also-rans in this year's countdown of best electronic goodness of 2015.We're back in techno territory and OOOOOH boy, I'm excluding some good people here. I'm gutted not to be including Hudson Mohawke's Lantern (Warp): it really was close. Scud Books was my favourite track this year and there was so much to love about the album. In fact, stop what you're doing and enjoy the low-fi pomp of this:Good, right? What do you mean you prefer Adele. Pfft.Becoming Real's Pure Apparition (Transgressive) didn't make it either despite Bleach sending shivers up my crumbling spine. Helena Hauff's Discreet Desires (Werkdiscs) made good work from dirty, retro electro, while there was a welcome return of Pole and the pleasingly detailed and difficult Wald (Pole).I liked the early morning techno feel of Anthony Naples's Body Pill (Text Records), while at the other end of the spectrum, John T Gast's debut Excerpts (Planet Mu) was as disaffecting and moody as you'd expect.The dense, brutal techno of XOSAR's Let Go (Black Opal) was engrossing, while on my notes for RAMZi's Houti Kush (1080p), I've just written \"odd fauna\". Post Scriptum's Post Scriptum 01 (Infrastructure) felt suitable alien - and that's it for now.The second best album of 2015 awaits, followed by some final also-rans, and then THE best album of 2015. Fact. Not my opinion. FACT. Stay tuned if you know what's good for you.-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----3 –  Holly Herndon – Platform (4AD)Holly Herndon destroyed music in 2015. She picked it up by earlobes and broke its face off. She then picked the fragments off the muddy floor then polished them up into a towering audio sculpture so astonishing, there is, was and will never be nothing like it again.This is Platform, a sequence of ten tracks that takes in surveillance, synthesis, pop music and Autechisms (yeah, that’s a word now). It’s so far removed from the hackneyed phrases of popular EDM that this has become an album that – emphasis with a capital N – Needs to exist.Amid all the ethereal abstraction, you wouldn't expect Chorus to actually have a chorus, you wouldn't expect Locker Leak to end up being her version of Everyone's Free (To Wear Sunscreen), and the opening horror of New Ways To Love suprises when it turns out to be a gateway to what might be a dungeon of choristers.For something so alien, it doesn’t half stick in your mind after listening. Everything's broken and I think I like it.-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----"},
{"title": "Best electronic albums of 2015: also-ran all-sorts", "date": "Dec 31, 2015", "text": "We're well past the half-way point now. Come on. You can do it. Here, have a sponge soaked in vinegar. Wait. That's not vinegar. Don't eat that sp-- oh too late. I'm not kissing you after that.Here are some more also-rans: a real mixed bag this time.Lnrdcroy's Much Less Normal (Firecracker) was a 2014 limited release given new lease of life this year on vinyl, and it was full of electronic earworms; a woozy mix indeed. Then there was... deep breath... in no particular order:Beat Spacek's soulful Modern Streets (Ninja Tune) was, of course, Steve Spacek. Disclosure's chart-busting Caracal (PMR Records) was okay for singles but I'm never that fussed for full albums of that stuff. Darkstar's Foam Island (Warp Records) was just a bit too pop for my tastes. Steve Reich fans could do well to check out the freeform minimalism of Dawn Of Midi's Dysnomia (Erased Tapes). Two albums put Buchlas back on the map: Charles Cohen's Brother I Prove You Wrong (Morphine Records), which sometimes came across as a soundtrack for Star Wars droids, and Frank Bretschneider's Sinn + Form (raster-noton) which had some nice waveform-wobbling static.And finally for this mixed bag, Panda Bear's Panda Bear Meets The Grim Reaper was melodic, Future Brown's Future Brown (Warp Records) plopped some fairly pleasurable dancehall and autotune into my ears, FIS's The Blue Quicksand Is Going Now (Loopy) was crazy and noisesome, and Dasha Rush's Sleepstep (raster-noton) had, among its dark electrics, playful ambience and poetry.When will the top ten return? Oh when? Very shortly, of course. Expect us to reach the number one at about 6.20pm.-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----4 –  Oneohtrix Point Never –  Garden of Delete (Warp)The best producers suck in disparate music genres and blurt out a complete vision – take Flying Lotus as an example. Within two minutes of GOD, you can hear 80s soft rock, footwork, soul vocals and epic prog electro. Full of surprises and yet coherent throughout.This magpie mentality persists throughout: cheesy pop vox on Sticky Drama, pastoral ambience on Child Of Rage, epic EDM anthemming on I Bite Through It. The latter track soon fractals into all sorts of noise – few other people could get away with one second of thrash guitar twenty seconds before the end of a track.I’ve always respected Oneohtrix in the past, but never fully connected. Perhaps there’s something about GOD that’s more immediate, more logical amid the perplexing palette on offer here. There are moments of beauty and beastliness – just listen to how Mutant Standard breaks down then resolves, or the malevolent yet moving mash-up of Freaky Eyes.I’m not sure where OPN is leading us, but I'm a convert: he can blurt in my face anytime.-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----Another brief respite from the top ten shenanigans as I look at some house music that didn't get through to the final stages. Roll up, roll up, all this house music is going for a song. Half a monkey to the weirdo in the tank top, deal done, sorted, job's a good 'un.It was nice to see Four Tet produce something so different with the Hindustani-themed Morning / Evening (Text) alongside his usual excellent fayre on Percussions - 2011 Until 2014 (Text Records). There wasn't much better in 2015 house music than Matrixxman's Homesick (Ghostly International) with is rich, developing minimalist themes. I was quite bewitched by Neu Balance's warm Rubber Sole (1080p), a curiously microscopic long-player of vocal blurts and dancefloor friendly mid-tempo rhythms.Hat doff too for a whole load of sampletastic disco Vibert-style on Kerrier District's 4 (Hypercolour), and to the punchy offering on John Tejada's Signs Under Test (Kompakt) which felt like a fuller, more analogue Pantha Du Prince. Romare's Projections (Ninja Tune) was quite a neat release that gained some rave reviews, and the Hauntologists' Hauntologists (Modular Cowboy / Honest Jon's Records) had some delightful bitty house and fussy minimalism that felt like a close relation to Factory Floor.So much house music. Surgeon's pounding Tresor '97 - '99 (Tresor) really did feel like the best of 90s techno, while it was fun watching Model 500 's Digital Solutions (Metroplex) express all that is Detroit in 2015. Pearson Sound's eponymous album (Hessle Audio) was a huge debut this year, although nothing on it matched Untitled for me. Finally, all hail the power techno on Head High's Home. House. Hardcore. (Power House) and the rediscovered space disco on Bjørn Torske's Nedi Myra and Trøbbel (Smalltown Supersound). Phew.Back to the top ten shortly, I promise. If you're behind with all of this, catch up on the link below. Can you guess what the number one might be?-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----5 –  Bjork –  Vulnicura (One Little Indian)How I hated Oh So Quiet. “How kooky” everyone exclaimed as I bit my lip and gnashed my teeth. Bjork was always much more than “kooky”, expressing depths in ways that left your garde well and truly avanted.Vulcinura is a return to form, but only in the way that one grades good and “bad” Coen Brothers films. The presence of Arca, featured elsewhere in this top ten, could have made this a clinical exercise in weirdness, but Bjork allows us to “explore the negative space” (Mouth Mantra) in a personal way I’ve not seen for a while. This meant to be Bjork’s relationship breakup album, and a sense of loss is drizzled throughout: not only her own pain, but for me it also recalled memories of her work with Mark Bell.There are no singles here, but plenty of highlights. Lionsong has a naive simplicity that wouldn’t be out of place on debut. Stonemilker is a gorgeous rhapsody and a downright earworm. Black Lake gives us a spine-tingling ten minutes: the themes suspend and resolve yet never lose us – a microcosm of the album itself.Vulnicura’s great. She really likes albums beginning with V, doesn’t she? How “kooky”.-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----If you're just looking at a single blog post right now, you can expand this whole best-albums series into one long stream by clicking here:-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----And now a whole bunch of more also-rans, starting with the amazing Nozinja. Do check his album out: it's an absolute joy. The lo-fi and addictive Shangaan electro of Nozinja's Nozinja Lodge (Warp Records) marked him out as one of the most entertaining musicians of our times. Just not enough for this top ten. Sorry, Nozy.I loved Wenu Wenu, and I wasn't disappointed to find more of the same on Omar Souleyman's follow-up Bahdeni Nami (Monkeytown Records). There was much to appreciate in Jaga Jazzist's Starfire (Ninja Tune), while if you've got the taste for it, try the cheese on Dâm-Funk's Invite The Light (Stones Throw).And there's more. Flanger's just-okay sometimes-jazzy brilliantly-named Lollopy Dripper (Nonplace), The Chemical Brothers' Born In The Echoes (Virgin Records) which just felt like old work reheated, Russell Haswell's mind-smashing but alienating As Sure As Night Follows Day (Diagonal), Colleen's bold Captain Of None (Thrill Jockey), a perfectly worthwhile Battles' La Di Da Di (Warp) and an avalanche of mouth harp on Donato Dozzy's The Loud Silence (Further Records). Not all bad, just not in my top ten - which continues in a few shakes of a gnat's nose.-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----6 –  Jlin –  Dark Energy (Planet Mu) Jlin's Dark Energy is a strange beast. So is most modern footwork. Expect staccato drum sequences and plenty of drilling repetition andbriefstop-startslike this like this like this like this like this.Fellow footworker RP Boo often goes for sonic power with his vocal iterations, but there’s something different at work here. Listen to the brooding scrapes of Ra, the alarmed intensity of Expand or the brilliant and almost adolescent refrain on Guantanamo of “you don’t wanna hurt anyone... but I do, and I’m sorry”. This would be an exercise in clinical cut-and-paste, but Jlin manages to make footwork sound human, albeit in a way that is brusque and as moody as hell.“Who do you think you’re talking to?” shouts Abnormal Restriction, the final track on Jlin’s debut for Planet Mu.  Somewhere amid the Eastern woodpecker calls on Unknown Tongues or the micro squeak refrain on Black Diamond that would normally have you sending off your Nintendo for repair, a realisation dawns: this is the most appropriately-titled album in this year's top ten. And what energy.-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----Time for a dip into the 91 albums that didn't make the final top ten.I apologise. Most of these are great, but I had to draw the line somewhere. Here are some good solid techno long-players that I sent off to bed without any supper.It was a very close-run thing with Flako's Natureboy (Five Easy Pieces) was such a pleasing listen and I do wonder if I'd discovered it earlier in the year, it would be well up my top ten. Eeps.I had a soft spot for the casual attitude of Kelpe's The Curved Line (DRUT) and also for the sinister techno on Lakker's Tundra (R+S). Walls' Urals (Ecstatic) was robotic and spacious like a, er, big old robot with lots of space inside. And gawd bless Luke Vibert and the reliable mid-paced head nodders on Bizarster (Planet Mu).Nosaj Thing's Fated (Timetable) almost seemed to be slicing the very nature of music itself before your ears. There was plenty of industrial noise on Container's LP (Spectrum Spools), not something I'm terribly excited by, and I found it hard to connect with Starkey's The Transponder Orchestra (Alpha Pup Records). Finally, Levon Vincent's self titled album (Novel Sound) contained simple themes with a filmic quality that just scraped my top 101.Enough. Let's get back to the winners. The top ten continues shortly.-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----7 – Floating Points – Elaenia (Pluto / Luaka Bop)If you want the standard FP brown-nosing, then hoover up the endless column inches elsewhere. In fact, I’m going to flip it and start with the negative because I'm a contrary Mary...Floaty “did a James Blake” and left his strongest previous work off his debut: no CMYK on Blake’s album and no Nuits Sonores here. And why be so excited by Pointy (yeah, I’ve got loads of nicknames for him) when we can get that same groovesome rhythm from Four Tet?Sigh. I'm such a plonkface. Those would be valid criticisms if FloPo hadn’t spewed out such a strong piece of work. Elaenia could have been a Greatest Hits So Far, but what he’s given us is a complete album full of live percussion and enough space to explore all the darkness and light of his sound.You can hear everything here, from Eno to Unkle to, thanks to the jazz influence, Flying Lotus. Elaenia is simply great: the long wait paid off. Good old Floppy.-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----"},
{"title": "Best electronic albums of 2015: these junglists aren't massive", "date": "Dec 31, 2015", "text": "I've just had a chat with the cool kids down at the discotheque, and they told me in no uncertain terms that the jungle is massive.With that in mind, let's take a look at the albums that (a) didn't make the final top ten and (b) can be classed as either jungle or grime because that's what all the youth clubs are playing nowadays. Don't worry, I'm being glib: I've not suddenly turned into a Radio 4 comedy script.Special Request dancefloor-mashing Modern Warfare (EPs 1-3) (XL Recordings) missed the final list only because it's a bunch of EPs thrown together rather than an album in its own right. Let's pretend it's in the top ten, yeah?There was much to love about the smooth junglism and sheer variety of Drew Lustman's The Crystal Cowboy (Planet Mu), and we also had supposedly the last album from Lee Bannon. His Pattern Of Excel (Ninja Tune) included slide guitar to great effect.I respected the following albums muchly: Record label kingpin Kode9's Nothing (Hyperdub), Visionist's Safe (Pan) in which an experimental take on grime took the genre to a new level, and the bold dubby bass of Sherwood & Pinch's Late Night Endless (On-U Sound / Tectonic Recordings).And finally, at the back of the grime pack - but hey, still in my top 101 - was Sam Binga's Wasted Days (Critical Recordings), Mumdance & Logos' Proto (Tectonic) and Rabit's hard and experimental Communion (Tri Angle).The kids are getting impatient. Let's get back to the top ten shortly, yeah? The number one's gonna be a real doozer.-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----8 – Arca – Mutant (Mute)As I type this, Justin Bieber has gifted the Christmas number one slot to a Simon & Garfunkel / Coldplay medley. Although the reasons are laudable (yay, NHS), thank goodness Arca exists to provide a thoughtful antidote to that soft-brushed, magnolia-vomited mainstream.I loved the sonic and visual power of Arca's Bjork support slot at the Manchester International Festival: the musical themes transmuted as adeptly as any Autechre set while we stood eye-boggled as he writhed his muscles at us.Mutant lives in its own broken universe, each track sticking to its theme. And what themes: the ideas don’t stop coming. The strangled screams of title track Mutant, the emotional stomp of Vanity, the thin pipes playing with the bendy bass of Snakes, the shredded rave of Umbilical, the almost straight IDM of Front Load.Mutant comes barely a year after his debut album and is all the more incredible for it. Simon & Garfunkel AND Coldplay? Save us, Arca.-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----Again, let's pause the top ten while I look at some of the albums that didn't make the cut.Ambient music is as old as the air we breathe and the wind that flaps the ear of the dog. Don't question that: it's an ancient Fat Roland saying. There were a whole bunch of ambient long-players not in my top ten:It was a shame not to include The Orb's Moonbuilding 2703 AD (Kompakt), a hugely enjoyable album and their best for donkey's years. I loved the crystalline perfection and a gloopy intensity of Acronym's June (Northern Electronics) – half ambient, half techno, all good.On the reserves bench was worriedaboutsatan's Even Temper (This Is It Forever) which goes a bit Clark on Church Of Red (that’s a good thing). I didn't mind the low-down junglism of ASC's Imagine The Future (Samurai Red Seal), nor the stunning atmospherics of CFCF's Radiance & Submission (Driftless Recordings) and their less successful sister album The Colours Of Life (1080p) which seemed to channel Phil Collins through the pixels of Teletext.Ones I was less keen on: Steve Hauschildt's pleasing Where All Is Fled (Kranky), Rrose's two-track drone monster Having Never Written A Note For Percussion (Further Records), Biosphere's dark collaboration with Deathprod on Stator (Touch) and the homespun noise of Philip Jeck's Cardinal (Touch).Back to the top ten shortly. Catch up with this whole series in one long stream by clicking this:-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----9 – The Black Dog – Neither/Neither (Dust Science)There’s sometimes an air of portent to The Black Dog’s work. They’ll chug along all frowny – business as normal for these Sheffield techno gods – then a lonesome chord will unsettle the living daylights out of you. And the best thing is, when that happens, you can feel the weight of this band's incredible history.Thankfully, there’s plenty of that on Neither/Neither. The title track feels airy but check that Boards of Canada feel with its shaking cymbals and the thrilling drop after the two-minute mark. The thumping Commodification holds all its power in its gasping bass end.The vocals add welcome personality here too, sporadic as they are: the conversational samples in the short filler tracks (mostly variations on the name “Phil”) or the hypnotic female voice loop on Platform Lvl 6.There is much beauty too: the building tension of Control Needs Time, the rising strings of Them (Everyone Is A Liar But), the twinkling melancholy of The Frequency Ov Thee Truthers. Welcome back to my top ten, doggies. You belong here.-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----Throughout this process, I had three rules.1. Don't worry about the albums I didn't notice. Other sites will cover those well enough.2. Nothing too poppy. Let's keep it a little bit snooty.3. No compilations.The second and third of these rules gave me a no-list: albums that I deliberately chose not to consider. Let's take a break from the top ten to see the also-rans that fell at the first hurdle for no reason other than my own jobsworthing:Sorry, Hot Chip, I really loved Why Make Sense? (Domino) but I decided it was on the wrong side of the pop line. Wowsers, though, how much did Huarache Lights sound like Orbital? Delicious.A number of compilations fell foul of the compilation rule. They included Berlin legends Berghain (Ostgut Ton) and their absolutely solid techno, Wolfgang Voigt's Protest tracks (Profan) dropping on CD for the first time, the top dub techno of The Wandering II (Silent Season), Jon Hopkins simply brilliant contribution to the Late Night Tales series, the DJ Kicks comps from persistent no-shower Actress and from wheels-of-steel prodigy DJ Koze (the latter including William Shatner and The Gentle People in his set), the thoroughly industrial Selected Cuts (Repitch) and the best compilation of the year, the epic µ20 (Planet Mu) wich gives you the best bang for your buck of anything released this year.Oh and AFX's Orphaned Deejay Selek (2006-2008) (Warp Records) was an EP not an album, so I struck it from my list then cried for about four days.Back to the top ten shortly. Remember, catch up on all these blog posts so far by clicking this magic link:-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <-----10 – Squarepusher  – Damogen Furies (Warp) The Square One’s fourteenth album lives in a very different world to his Hard Normal early days. Stadium EDM is everywhere now: huge crowds, plenty of lasers and more bangers than a balloon animal practice academy.And so Four-Sides, as I like to call him, has given Damogen Furies a live feel: I read somewhere these tracks were produced in single takes. This frees him from his slap bass noodling and instead gives us an on-the-button collection of digital mayhem.There are crowd-pleasing tunes – the Hudmo-style bombast of Baltang Arg, the sad earworm of Stor Eiglass, the compressed-to-heck melody of Rayc Fire 2 – but most of Damogen Furies treads an angry line between repressed brutality and armchair listening.I guess, because of his recording process, there’s less befuddling eccentricity (compare this work to, say, 2008’s A Real Woman), which is a shame, but it’s still one of his most likeable albums of recent years.-----> Best electronic albums of 2015 <----- Welcome to my grand list of the best albums of 2015.As in previous years (2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009), I cannot claim my list to be definitive. My brain is like an old filing cabinet: it has run out of space, the metal's all bent and there's been a label saying TRACEY on the front for years. But it is the best of electronic music as I see it, right here, right now in 2015.Here's how this is going to play. There are going to be twenty blog posts, each twenty minutes apart. In the first post after this one, I'll give you one of the top ten. Then for the second post, I'll give you a whole bunch of also-rans, some of which are brilliant and some of which are average. Then another of my top ten. Then more also-rans. Then another top ten album, then more also-rans, and so on until we get to number one: the best electronic music album of this year.By half six tonight, I will have thrown 101 albums at your face.

Time for me to choose my favourite albums of 2015.This whole thing was getting to be a waste of time because, as we all know, the album died. No-one attended the funeral and all of our albums became table coasters or gaudy jewellery.Thankfully, however, Adele came along and saved the album. Her latest album sold 16 trillion copies, almost all on cassette, and now the long-player is alive again. Phew!Adele is not in my top ten. Nor in my top 101. Yes, 101.

{"title": "When the Dog and Partridge became The Beautiful South...", "date": "Dec 19, 2015", "text": "Do you remember The Beautiful South pub?Here's my recollection. In the mid-90s The Beautiful South released Blue Is The Colour. You know the songs: Don't Marry Her; Rotterdam (Or Anywhere). Kind of twee, a bit of an indie sensibility, great for coffee tables.There's one aspect of the album promotion, though, that seems to have disappeared off the page of history. To tie in with the album, the Dog And Partridge pub in Didsbury (pictured) was rebranded.The D&P was a bit of a legend back then, known for not only being part of the infamous Didsbury Dozen, but also for its sawdust and gigantic doorstop open sandwiches.The D&P was stripped of its name and turned into a big blue-fronted 'THE BEAUTIFUL SOUTH'. I suspect it was for photo shoots for record company artwork.I'm having trouble, though, finding any documentary evidence that this happened. And by \"finding evidence\", I mean, \"I googled it for a bit and it didn't come up\".I might have the details wrong. I dunno. Alas John Turrell, the pub columnist I used to work with just round the corner from the D&P, is no longer with us, so I don't even have a handy expert to ask. After a Facebook conversation, my mate Iain contacted the local paper (pictured) - maybe something will come of that.Do you remember the Beautiful South rebranding of the Dog And Partridge? Were you involved with the project? Are you a dog and/or a partridge? Leave a comment. Or email me. I'd love to know more. Sorry this wasn't about electronic music. But those doorstop sandwiches were great."},

Y'know, something like Rudolph Died but all 3D like Michael Bay or something.But there's something really valuable in being quiet. For the past couple of years, I've coped with the pressure of Christmas with a strict corset of writing deadlines, but this year I'm going to let it hang all loose and floppy.This year has all been about pressure. Not just the Edinburgh Fringe, but writing group deadlines, submissions to a short story course and all the planning that comes with Bad Language. All of this is pleasurable, of course, and I've had the most amazing year. Life feels like one big playground. But I need a little space.And so I may not turn up to your Christmas drinks. I may not appear at that many spoken word events this month. And if Santa wants to hitch a lift again this year, he can flip well get a megabus.Having said that. Quiet Fat Roland still means a lot of activity.

Blogs, a word which is short for \"web logs\", are the future and-- wait, hold on, the phone's ringing.Hello? Yes, speaking? Sorry, what? Twit-what? No I've not heard of a \"Face book\". Does it have actual faces? Hello? Hello? Are you there? Don't hang up. You're the first person I've spoken to for 11 years. It's so... quiet here. I'm cold. Hug me. Please. Just for a while. What?

We talked about some pretty good topics like diversity on open mic stages. We also talked about loads of boring stuff that got cut from the final edit. The other interviewee you hear is Nija Dalal-Small, radio producer and host of In The Dark and The Real Story (both excellent).I'm kind of hoping Rob Cutforth, the apocalypse-minded writer host, got mixed up and kept all the boring stuff by mistake. There's only one way to find out. Have a listen here or on Soundcloud here.Evidently, the renowned Salford poetry night, host their own radio show, and I popped up on that a few weeks ago as one half of Bad Language. Have a listen here. I can't remember what we talked about. Stuff. Things. I really enjoyed it, whatever it was.Do check out the other podcasts / shows they've got.

It does mean I've been off the radar a little this month.I've not much coming up. November and December will feel like time off, despite at least four Bad Language events. Also, later this month, I compere a new spoken word night in Didsbury called The Word. I'm really looking forward to this: it'll be in an old stomping ground with a fairly new crowd for me. Then in December, I return to the Contact Theatre to perform with Mothers Ruin, alongside local poetry legend Gerry Potter, spectactular drag hero Cheddar Gorgeous and whole bunch of other talented alternative artists. This will sell out, so grab a ticket now. It'll be fun to play with queer identity in my usual idiotic style.Someone asked me today if all this performance stuff is leading me in a direction I want. I dunno. I'm lucky enough to have spare time to trounce round Manchester stages building and knocking down weird word sandcastles. Other people my age have families and commitments and boring things like organised sock drawers: I get to splurge my idiocy over audiences in the name of art. I'm having immense fun.Perhaps there are two things I'm neglecting. Partly my health: I definitely could do with shedding a pound or twenty. And mainly, my fiction writing: I have a file full of stories to polish, and new ones to write. Proper page stuff, not throwaway idiot open mic stuff.Like I say, not much coming up. Ahem."},

Recently it's been ambient dub centred around the Beyond label of the mid-90s. I went through a big house phase a few weeks ago. And sometimes I just want noisy techno (Objekt's pretty good for this: I keep hearing sounds on the street that sound like this album).Acid, though, is the music I'll always go back to whatever my mood. Because of its technological restraints (imagine having a genre of music that can only be made on the banjo), acid barely changes. One Josh Wink record aside, it has never commercialised, nor has it ever faded to nothing.I Love Acid are parping out some great records at the moment.

There may be spilled gravy over Ed Sheeran's performance on X Factor, but no-one's going to get into a humus fight over the best era of Lords Of Acid. Acid is somehow secret clubber's knowledge, forever shaded from the glare of the mainstream. Maybe it's the drug connotations, I dunno.Not that I've ever done the drug. No seriously, I haven't.

There are a bunch of themes at work in Slow Reader, namely:> Good writing is about editing, about ditching everything superfluous. It’s likely, therefore, that a writer will have deleted many more words than will have ended up in their final draft. Slow Reader is about that creative process of cast-offs and half-ideas; the fuzzy fragments that live at the edges of the creative mind that either don’t coalesce into something solid, or are written and then destroyed.> The text in the exhibition is taken from several years' worth of my short stories. Many phrases and feelings live on from that work as fragments in my mind, as half-memories. This is those fragments writ large on the walls of a Manchester pub.> The title also plays my habit of losing my place in a book. I don't fold pages or use bookmarks.

My last few Kraftwerk Badger Spaceships went well, and now I am at home in Manchester. My Fringe is over. No more performing. No more attending. No more flyering. Just a big, gassy bag of nothing.All I have now are reflections of a remarkable time. Here are those reflections in no particular order:> I wanted to put on 14 shows, stay healthy, and enjoy the experience. Achievement unlocked. My average audience was something like 14 people, which ain’t bad for an unknown. I saw big names getting just 5 more than me. Nearly 200 people chose to see my debut Fringe show above a squillion other possibilities. Lawks.> Early in the run, I was editing for two hours a day. Then it was one hour, then it was single sentences, and then I had a lovely moment a few days ago when all I had to edit between shows was one word (from “horse” to “stallion” if you must know). This means those that saw KBS later in the month saw a better show. Sorry 'bout that.> Throw in a couple of low audiences or a walk-out from a famous comedian, and the isolation of an Edinburgh show really hits you. Enthusiastic audience feedback tempered this, and two lovely hosts in the north of the city kept me grounded. And yes, the city itself is such an eye-hugger, it has a way of architecturing your spirits back to health.> I’m being judged against stand-ups who do this most days of their life. So throw in a run of high audiences and the knowledge that I’m hitting all my performance marks, and there is no better feeling. I’ll always remember the beaming or bemused faces in front of me, or that one person in every show who Does Not Get It, thereby proving my artistic worth.> I was so limited. Hundreds of flyers remained un-flyered, I was slow to put up posters, I didn’t chase press interest as much as I should have done, and I barely did any guest appearances. But if I’d spent more time on that, the show itself would have been worse. Next year’s to-do list has already started.> I’ve still so much to learn. I think I will look back on this debut show as a rickety, loveable tin-pot contraption that worked perfectly well thank you very much. What an experience.

But the clouds spat their contempt when the heavens opened as I was flyering on the Royal Mile on Friday afternoon.To make it worse, an jolly acapella group next to me blasted out the insipid plop of wedding-reception vomit that is Pharrell Williams' Happy. I cursed my life and I moved further down the Royal Mile for some peace and quiet. And lo and behold, God placed next to me another acapella group. And guess what they were singing. Yeah, you guessed it. In Edinburgh, you are never more than six feet away from the dried, brittle shell of Pharrell Williams' credibility.I have five more Kraftwerk Badger Spaceships left before I skateboard back to Manchester. Rather than winding down, it feels the show is gaining momentum. Not necessarily in numbers (they're keeping quite healthy considering how weird the show is, and the audiences seem delighted), but creatively I'm treading new paths. Paths with increased momentum. On my skateboard. Basically, what I'm saying is I'm gaining momentum by treading a path on a skateboard. I'm confused. What was I saying again?Some recent big-ticket Fringe highlights: Stewart Lee being angrily visceral, George Egg's unique and spectacular cookery comedy, Joseph Morpurgo's blistering inventiveness, and drinks with friends. Some great spoken word events too (Oh Standfast / Cassie Atkinson, Stand-Up Versus Slam, Luke Wright). I tried for tickets for Nina Conti and Bridget Christie, but failed.

I got a flipping review.After only ever performing a one hour show a handful of times in my life, a reviewer sat in my audience and scribbled this for Broadway Baby: \"Badger Spaceship is a seriously excellent piece of music-based comedy, and is a delight to sit through.\" It reads like there's a star missing, and the reviewer says \"inane\" a lot, but consider this:> The show starts with a dry reading off a page to test the audience's literary mettle and, it has to be said, stamina. I am fascinated with audience alienation as a comedy tool. What I do is not 'easy' comedy.> I'm ridiculously inexperienced at this type of performance, and I'm being judged against comedians that have worked their material over hundreds of times.> The show is in a deep level of flux. I'm tweaking Kraftwerk Badger Spaceship every day. Some new bits work, some new bits don't so they get chopped, but the new ending is landing the show beautifully.So am I proper chuffed with that review? You betcha.I'm now into the second half of the run. Today is my birthday show. So it's time to increase the risks.I've switched out a weaker element of the show, which will shift the whole structure, and instead I've added these little chaps (pictured above). Already grasping for that extra star... I feel like I'm living on the streets, despite being put up by generous hosts north of the city centre. I'm still staggering around Edinburgh in my homemade sandwich-board. I'm slowly toasting in the sun. My trainers have fallen apart. Yesterday, I paid £6 for a microwaved quiche: apparently \"some rocket\" constitutes a salad these days. If only I was a normal stand-up comedian: I'd totally mine that for content.

I'm more pleased than a buffalo in a model aircraft shop. The audience responded like a newt riding a toboggan. Basically, something-something animal in something-something humans use.I went to see Sam Simmons' wondeful Spaghetti For Breakfast. Sam's one of those people who's trying to bring something unique to his shows, someone who's blazing a trail of creativity through a dying forest of 't-shirt-and-jeans' stand-up comedians. Not that you should set fire to trees. Sam saw me at a bus stop after the show, thanked me for coming and shook my hand. We embraced, pressed our cheeks together and both rasped in unison, \"let's petrol-bomb a larch.\" Okay, that last sentence didn't happen, but the point is he's a nice bloke and what he's doing is weirdly important.One chap to whom I handed a flyer told me he owned a Moog. \"Robert Moog gets a mention in my show,\" I said. He seemed happy with that information. I also met a cartoonist for the Beano. Two dogs have asked for flyers. Someone told me to laminate my sandwich-board: I presume that was local speak for something. Tell you what: flyering's a trek but it works. I reckon it's adding a third onto my modest audience figures. Can't complain.Do make noise about the show if you can, chums. I'm a third of the way through.

Kraftwerk Badger Spaceship runs from August 6th to 19th at the Cellar Monkey, and there's a Manchester preview on July 26th. All free as part of Laughing Horse's brilliant free fringe.Writing an Edinburgh show is different if you're under the category of \"spoken word\". It's not as if I'm a gigging comedian polishing the same 20 minutes week in, week out. In fact, us spoken word acts have it easy.At least, I thought it would be easy. As it happens it's kind of hard. This is how the show looks so far. I've kept it vague so there are no spoilers.> Me doing an introduction to tell you everything that's going to happen over the next hour;> Me imparting some of my amazing wisdom about electronic music. I expect lots of \"aahs\" and \"oohs\" at this point;> Me attempting something approaching poetry although I've looked it up in a dictionary and I thought a \"poetry\" was a kind of fancy spoon;> A few things that have gone down well recently because the audience laughed and didn't throw tomatoes or rocks or saucepans;> A bit where it all gets a bit down. I call this the \"dip\". Feel free to scroll your phone at this point.> A chunk of audience interaction, assuming I have an audience by this point and the room is just me and some chairs and a startled mouse transporting a piece of cheese from one side of the room to the other.And I have little linky bits that should glue the whole lot together, done in the same style as the introduction. What I'm missing at the moment is an end. And I'm missing a specific element of uncertainty (other than the audience interaction or response) that will keep all 14 shows fresh for me, and add a bit of an extra challenge for my performance. Fear not. I have ideas.This whole experience of piecing together a show has had some serious ebbs and flows. I think I have something, then it drifts away. Ideas wash into my head like the tide, tickling my brain with their bubbles, then all I have left is seaweed. One day I can look at my show and see 50 minutes of brilliant material: the next day, I think I have 10.One thing I do have is confidence that the show will be entirely Me, capital M.

On Sunday, I saw Bjork play the Castlefield Arena, and she was her usual uncompromising mesmerising self. And tonight, I get to see Maxine Peake in Skriker.I won't bore you with my reviews of MIF events. There are plenty of people doing a better job than l'il ole Fats. And indeed, the slight disappointment of Damon Albarn's Wonder.land musical, which I saw a couple of days ago, is well documented on social media.What I do want to bore you with, however, is something that left me speechless, that made me never want to set foot in a traditional theatre again.I got to the Palace Theatre having paid £30 for my Wonder.land ticket. I decided to do what other theatre-goers do: buy a drink when I arrived, then order one for the interval. The bar was bereft of pumps, so I scanned their fridge for bottles. The best drink they has was Carling. Yeesh. That's okay. I was out of my comfort zone already: let's live a little and drink Carling.\"Can I have a Carling please? And one for the interval?\"\"No problem, hot blogger guy. Lemme just sort that for you now.\"This is how the conversation went, honest. The bar person waved a plastic pint glass at me, and I nodded and smiled. No problem. I understood the need for an audience not to have a load of glass projectiles to hand. So far, so good.She poured the Carling into the pint glass expertly and without over-foaming. It barely reached the half-pint mark. I balked a little. Must do small bottles in theatres, I thought.\"Is that alright, hot blogger guy?\"\"Yeah.

I was selected to attend the Short Shrift short story writing course curated by Jenn Ashworth and Litfest. On occasional Saturdays in 2015, I took my words up to Lancashire to have them prodded and poked by fellow writers.This course has been a ray of light these past few months. There are five others on the course and they are, without exception, lovely people. We submitted and critiqued work and we absorbed buckets of inspiration from our tutor Jenn Ashworth, a creative writing lecturer and author of The Friday Gospels, and also from a brilliant Q&A with the ridiculously talented Kirsty Logan. I take away from the course a renewed respect for the writing process. I can see the mechanics of a short story much more clearly now, and yet that hasn’t dulled my enthusiasm for the works we’ve revelled in since January: John McGregor, Leonora Carrington, Raymond Chandler, Ali Smith and of course Flannery O’Connor. In fact, considering I’m so busy with Bad Language and the Edinburgh Fringe, I’m amazed I got as much as I did from the course. Tomorrow, on Friday July 3rd, us course pupils will present our work to the public in Lancaster (click here for tickets). It’ll be a small crowd but it’ll be fun to hear our work over a microphone, and to chat about writing and process and whether Bics are the bestest pens ever (they are)."},

Magic a turnip into a buffalo. Jeez, enough of the alchemy already.Four! Embrace the Ibiza weather and produce a novelty chart hit. You will need a bouncy beat, sheep for the video, a traffic warden saying \"techno\" over and over to a camera, loads of pilfered samples and, of course, comedy shades.Five! Attend any stadium techno gig. Secreted on stage they'll have a couple of fans, to keep them and their equipment cool. Nick the fans mid-set. Knock over their laptop. Nudge the mains switch. And run like heckers because the Chemical Brothers *will* kick your face off.Twelve! It is only scorching because your love of techno is bringing hell on earth. Placate God's judgement by listening to more holy music genres, such as hymns, country and western, prog rock and trap.Seventy!

This was, though, much more of a collaborative effort: Bad Language won ‘best spoken word night’ at the 2015 Saboteur Awards, which means it’s the best spoken word night the UK. Or at least, in the geographical area that covers Saboteur funding. There may be other spoken word award ceremonies, I don’t know. There are probably thousands of them. Millions. Anyhoo, it’s good, whatever it means.I decided in 2013 that I wanted to run Bad Language. I went to B&Q, bought some pitchforks, and scared two thirds of the organising team off to London. Third organiser Joe Daly proved a much stronger foe: he insisted on running it with me. Our organising meetings consist of us throwing rocks at each other while shouting really long names from the Bible. Somehow, we manage to put on well-attended nights without everyone being fried by killer robots, and the Sab Award has made all the hard work worthwhile. Thanks to the hundreds who voted for us. This is a testament to the dedication of our audience, the commitment of our performers, and Joe’s immense drive for new and interesting events. I couldn’t make the ceremony itself. I had to be in work to throw some numbers at spreadsheets. Joe went to the Sabs with Bad Language co-founder Dan Carpenter. It sounds like they had a great time. They hooked up with all sorts of people from the UK literature scene: I’ve seen the photos on Facebook of them all bleary-eyed and wine-stained. I’m not bitter. E17, by the way. That’s my favourite spreadsheet cell. That and U96. I sometimes sing Stay Another Day and Das Boot as I sit there in front of the spreadsheet. On my own. No, I’m not bitter at all. It’s been an honour to co-host Bad Language for the past 14 months. I don’t know where we go from here: our only aim is to put on great live literature in Manchester.

Many people won't know what living under a Tory majority is like: the last time they won an election, Right Said Fred and Altern-8 were in the top ten.It's okay though because I have sure-fire methods so we all survive the next five years.1. Dig a holeIt doesn't matter where you are - in your garden, in front of the toaster, in the shower - start digging. Make it a good and deep hole. Climb into the hole on regular occasions.Make friends with the worms. The hole is your home.2. Make a Baked AlaskaIs it hot? Is it cold? It's both, but how can that be? Baked Alaska is the most demonic of all the desserts and its contradictions can never be understood. Make a Baked Alaska.Then bury it in the hole for it must never be mentioned ever again.3. Rant on social mediaRant on social media about how awful the government is. Your followers in your part of the echo chamber will love you for this, because they agree with you and deserve to be castigated for that. Whatever you do, don't write letters or contact those in power.Install broadband in your hole.4. Arm yourselfWhen the hospitals get sold off to casinos and every third child is converted into Tesco shares, you'll need a high profile and shocking strategy. Have several dozen extra arms grafted onto your body. Run down the street flapping your new limbs like an octopus on Free Scallop Tuesday.Be careful not to fall down a hole. There will be a lot of holes by now.5. Rent out your chinRent your chin to campers and caravanners. Offer cheap toilets and good drainage. Show them the view from your forehead. Tell them this is as good as anywhere on Anglesey, although the crazy golf is shut for the summer. When they ask you about your ill-advised goatee, change the subject. Perhaps suggest they move their tent into the hole. It has Baked Alaska in.Mmm, Baked Alaska, they'll say as they lick their CamperGaz stove with longing in their eyes.In summary...Many will suffer under this government. Ranting on social media will not be enough. Choose your campaigns, whether it's 38 Degrees or Liberty or Quaker Social Action. Whatever. But choose something and start small, for you will need your energy.Be active, be kind, be focussed.You didn't expect this to suddenly get serious, did you? I'm thinking through how I can become more socially active over the next five years: when I do this, my imagination throws out a load of junk. Hence the arm/chin nonsense above.Sorry about that. There is no such thing as an octopus-human. And Baked Alaska is kind of disgusting.We need to protest as much as we did back in the 1990s. You are not in a hole. You can stand tall, and you can speak to power. In the words of Right Said Fred, it's time to Activ-8.Wait.Wrong band, dammit."},

If you like Robert Hood, vote Conservative.LabourEd Miliband is inaccessible and awkward. Spend enough time with him and you may begin to understand him.  He is Autechre. If you like Autechre, vote Labour.Liberal DemocratNick Clegg is someone you drifted from a long time ago. You wonder how you were ever into him because he seems so, meh. He is Zero 7. If you like Zero 7, vote Liberal Democrat.GreenNatalie Bennett is different from the others. In some way this is good. In some ways this is bad. Listening to her is not always the most pleasant experience. She is the hardcore gabba band Neophyte. If you like Neophyte, vote Green.The other oneNigel Farage is awful, like something on the bottom of your shoe that could be a slug or someone's excrement, you're not sure. And yet, he's so listenable. Catchy, even. He is LMFAO (pictured). If you like LMFAO and think women should \"shut the f*** up\" (Redfoo, 2014), vote Ukip.I don't have a Plaid Cymru or an SNP near me, but obviously they'd be Boards of Canada and Scooter respectively.That's decided it then. I think.Did Emily Davison throw herself under those hooves just so I could ooze this kind of nonsense all over my blog? Has Simon Cowell bought the copyright on the X we have to place in the box on Thursday? Am I going to have that LMFAO track in my head for much longer?All will be decided in the 2015 UK general election. Whoever wins, we're going to have to listen to them for five years.This track (see below) feels like all build-up, but that's no bad thing considering it's the opener to the Chemical Brothers' new album. Sometimes I Feel So Deserted could have done with a pneumatic drop at that three-minute mark. Still, it's acidy and deep and bodes well for their first studio album for five years.I recently wrote up a review of Leftfield's first album in 16 years.

What I found was a makeshift, friendly, scrappy, laughy affair in a place that was clearly in the advance stages of being junked.My fellow performers included Tales Of Whatever's Mark Powell and my longtime pretend twin brother Lee Moore. The set-up was a bit, um, minimal, so we put a load of chairs out and nipped to the Co-op to buy beers for everyone. We took donations, and there is a special place in hell for the people who dumped foreign coins on us.I read an updated version of my tweets from David Cameron, a couple of short stories and, in what has turned out to be a live favourite, an untitled piece about an attractive stranger told through web searches.We left when people started wrecking stuff.

I feel like I’m the only post-rave kid in town.Everyone else is either eighties post-industrial electronic music with its awkward lip-synching chart crossovers or they’re from that post-Kid A world where computers became so ubiquitous for so many types of bands, dance music was no longer a political and musical protest against the norm.There’s a longer article in this. I may write it for Electronic Sound.I guess I’m just blaming my weirdness on knowing that there was a third part to Orbital’s Lush 3-1 and Lush 3-2, or that Fish & Chips wasn’t just a seaside indulgence but was one of the 90s’ most blistering acid workouts.People need to know this stuff.

Let’s not get hoist on technicalities.Now that I’m only four years younger than Ed Miliband, which is how most age should be measured, I’ve realised I’m surrounded by people that don’t listen to new music. They stopped with Fleetwood Mac in 1984 or with Nirvana in 1993 or with Fatman Scoop in 2001.Instead they listen to the chiming melodies of mortgages or new-born sprogs. Meetings. Commitments. Responsibilities. Other long words.“I wouldn’t know how to find new music these days,” they say, despite the internet providing numerous behemoths championing new bands: a far cry when it was basically a choice between a couple of inky weeklies and Top Of The Pops. “It was better in the olden days,” they spout, while cementing up their earholes and burying their head in sand.At least, I thought so. Yet when I put this to Twitter, the reasons for missing out on new music weren't so simple.For some, new music can be noise, and noise can be bad for mental health - or conversely, a release. It could be you're catching up on all the old new music, or you could have a time-guzzling project on the go (referring here to Friends trifle star Neil Kilham's impressive plan to listen to all 18,000 of his mp3s - in order).While some delight in the past and simply have no problem with it at all.

{"title": "I too am a book killer: the Manchester Central Library book disposal", "date": "Feb 14, 2015", "text": "This is a rant. I have edited it down as much as I can. But it is still a rant.Firstly, have a look at this story about a Manchester library disposing of books. It's an echo of a similar story in 2012.Here are my bookseller thoughts.I don't get the furore over Manchester Central Library​ pulping books, if indeed they have done. We all think about classics and rarities, but most old books are without value, however you choose to define value. Just look at the 1p sales on Am*z*n.I once found a recycling bin containing old books at the back of a Manchester university. That too was a quiet disposal, albeit on a smaller scale. I was initially shocked - but all of them were crap old academic stock no-one would have been interested in.Let's assume the reported 240,000 figure is correct. 50 Shades Of Grey weighs 396 grammes. 240,000 50 Shades would weigh 95 tonnes. (That's the equivalent weight of a free Renault Clio given to every member of Take That every day for a month. And I mean a March or July month, not a February or June month.) That's a lot of weight. And space. And 24-hour storage, which costs.We *could* pour taxpayer money into storing four copies of the third edition of, I dunno, Understanding Glass Making, with all of its out-of-date techniques. I'm presuming their techniques have changed. Bad example. Anyhoo...Or we could close the beautiful new Archives-plus room at the library so they have space for them all.Or we could dispose of the old stuff. We could leave it to their hugely experienced expert librarians to save what is worth saving (and there will have been lots of great stuff I'm sure they have kept) and then to choose all the gubbins we never saw or wanted to see anyway.What's the other option? Produce a 240,000-book list and submit it to a public vote?And here's the rub. The book industry pulps books all the time. Booksellers fill \"red\" boxes for that very purpose. I recently filled one of those boxes with a book written by a Manchester lecturer whose department used those very recycling bins I mentioned earlier. That's karma for you. It wasn't a bad book. It was just, well, our industry pulps books. Storage is not infinite but our capacity to produce new books is. It's an uneasy truth for book lovers.I love books but I am also a book killer. Pulping makes us gasp with horror, but pulping helps new books survive.I should point out that the full truth of the Central Library story is not clear at the time of writing, and this is indeed a possibly ill-informed rant. They may well have dropped the ball. They may just need better PR. But the public debate needs to hear this: the industry value of books may define 'value' in a way you haven't considered before.Feel free to throw books at me the in the comments."},

The best thing to come out of Bristol since, um, (googles) Ribena and/or Tarmac."},

One of those projects is Body Down, a Johnny Cash-mangling track, that is now available to stream or download for free.Incidentally, any money raised from downloads will go to SOS Children's Villages, who have previously been supported by a Cash memorial fund.

Or at least, an idea of what might be in the running.Still, as part of the process, I earwig around 80 albums. Some albums I listen to a lot, including the ones that don't make it. Many of them are part listens: I just know if something is going to count for the final ten or not because, well, the end-of-year chart is a culmination of absorbing 12 months of music scene.The final listening process is more about plugging gaps, and wrestling over whether something is going to be number twelve or ten or eight. Kassem Mosse benefited from that process this year, while Flying Lotus lost out.Sometimes that avalanche of 80 albums can bring an unexpected discovery. Kiasmos (pictured) was one of them. I'd never heard of them, and I was won over within half a minute of the first play. They ended up at number three in the chart after I caned the replay button.And it seems friends in webland are now converts. Which makes the top ten all the more worthwhile. Hurrah.Here's some Kiasmos."},
{"title": "Best electronic albums of 2014: one", "date": "Dec 31, 2014", "text": "1 – Syro – Aphex Twin (Warp)The bulldozer of journalistic detritus that accompanied Aphex Twin's comeback album made listening to it something akin to pressing a portable radio to your ear while inside a car crusher. Great beats, you’d think, while bent gearsticks and battered pistons snapped your bones. I like the sounds, you’d mumble from inside your compressed cube of waste metal.Comment pieces, inked hyperbole; so much noise online. It left me unable to think, unable to register its true significance. Of course I’ll make this the number one. It’s what should happen, right?So I allowed space. I listened to a bit of Richard Clayderman instead. I listened to a smidgeon of Paolo Nutini. A snatch of One Direction.Actually, this is all lies, but I did put the album aside so I could return to it fresh. And what an album. It’s beguiling, teasing, melodic and beautiful. It's the Aphex grin writ large, but without the nastiness: the cheeky shuffles in Minipops; the twisted g-funk of Circlont6a, the loose, knowing percussion of Produk 29, the optimistic ambience of Papat4. (Forgive the heavily-subbed track titles.)His waspish processing may sound unsettled, and it’s certainly ordered into 32-bar sequences rather than traditional song structure, but the strength of Syro is in James’ pursuit of melody and then following that melody to captivating conclusions. S950tx16wasr10 is busy, but its notes are that of the first Selected Ambient Works. Circlont14 is all about the descending harmonies. Xmas_Evet10 made me so melancholic, I've burnt my Christmas decs along with my (non-existent!) Nutini CDs.This isn't the product of a decade's silence: he's been sneaking these tracks into live sets for ages. In the simplest terms, Syro is very, very, [insert hyperbolic verbage and fire up the bulldozer] good.Great beats. I like the sounds. Welcome back, Rich.[Click here for the full top ten]Thanks for reading. Revisit the top ten best electronic albums of 2014 by clicking here.2 – Clark – Clark (Warp)You might need a lighthouse for this one, because the clouds are rolling in.This is Clark’s uncompromising seventh album where the creaking wrath of opener Ship Is Flooding spreads throughout the album, threatening the brisk Unfurla, washing over the beatless Beacon, and engulfing everything on There’s A Distance In You. We are never allowed too far from that source, despite many entertaining distractions: dismembered choirboys on Snowbird, the Lone-style chops of Silvered Iris, the shimmering yet angry epic Winter Linn.Sonically, it works best as a sister album to Turning Dragon or Totems Flare, but somewhere here, submerged in analogue murk, is his strongest intent yet. Stick your head above the gloom and allow yourself this moment of clarity: Clark is probably Warp’s most significant artist, matching Squarepusher in album output.But while his Squareness spit-polishes his jazzy LEDS, Chris Clark plunges ever deeper depths and remains blisteringly entertaining.[Click here for the full top ten]A special mentionBefore I tie up the loose ends of those that didn't quite make it into this year's top ten, there's something I want to point out. In 2014, we lost two incredible talents: Gravenhurst's Nick Talbot and LFO's Mark Bell. I hope, over the years, this blog has celebrated innovation and passion in music. When that passion is cut short, a bit of all of us withers.I joke about the '27 club', but sometimes the gap between here and there is a thin place, and life is fragile. My own life is coloured with grief more than my stupid humour would perhaps suggest, so to family, friends and fans of Nick and Mark, I mourn with you.Some also-ransRight. Time to execute the final stragglers before we lead into the number one album of 2014. (See? Stupid humour.) Caustic Window used Kickstarter to give us an archive album that was an interesting artefact if not the best example of, erm, thingummy's work. I loved, loved, loved Lee Bannon's robust junglism on Alternate/Endings (Ninja Tune). There was much to admire in DJ Q's dancefloor-friendly Ineffable (Local Action). And finally, I was sorry not to include the following: Rustie's Green Language (Warp) which lost the spark of his previous work, Caribou's Our Love (City Slang) which had so much good stuff (Can't Do Without You), and Luke Abbott's Wysing Forest (Border Community), which lacked the immediacy of his previous work.Stay tuned for the number one. Although you've probably worked it out by now.[Click here for the full top ten]"},
{"title": "Best electronic albums of 2014: three", "date": "Dec 30, 2014", "text": "3 – Kiasmos – Kiasmos (Erased Tapes)Featuring a BAFTA winner – Olafur Arnald –makes me want to scrub my blog with a scouring pad. Even though Kiasmos was seven years in gestation, it all seems so mainstream. A house beat, some gentle piano, touches of intensity. Maybe it’s a fading echo of last year’s top album. So much logic working against this. And yet...Feel the energy on Looped. The bite of Burnt. Let it hook behind your ribcage and flutter your organs. Can you feel it? It’s a close, personal album; snare drums are swapped for finger clicks.Less is more. You'll play this to bits.[Click here for the full top ten]Some also-ransVenetian Snares, bless his cotton elks, delivered an absolute tune with the title track of My Love Is A Bulldozer (Planet Mu). A bit more chilled was Gunnar Haslam's ambient and organic Mirrors and Copulation (L.I.E.S.). Prins Thomas evoked old cinema with disco on his Prins Thomas III (Full Pupp). Actress' Ghettoville (Werkdiscs / Ninja Tune) was too fuzzy-edged, while Actress collaborator Copeland went pleasingly Tricky-like on Because I'm Worth It (self-released). Cristian Vogel's Polyphonic Beings (Shitkatapult) was a little too academic and weird. I didn't include the chuffing excellent FKA Twigs and LP1 (Young Turks) because it was too singer-songwriter for this list. And - drumroll - the worst album of 2014 was Roni Size's Take Kontrol (Mansion Sounds). Half-cocked, mind-numbing dull 'n' bass: he's capable of so much better.[Click here for the full top ten]4 – Lone – Reality Testing (R&S Records)Lone’s best album to date only finds itself at number four because 2014 saw some serious competition for a place in this chart.There’s a cartoonish quality to Reality Testing’s choppy space music, but there’s depth too: listen to him channel Rae & Christian on 2 is 8, or the spirit of urbanity evoked in Aurora Northern Quarter. There’s even poetry (from Shawn Powers) on Stuck. And drizzled over the distractive Detroit beats is the same kind of melancholia Brian Eno once gave earnest rock bands: a new tone for Lone.As the voice boldly proclaims on Airglow Fires: “wut!”[Click here for the full top ten]Some also-ransI enjoyed Application's System Fork (Dust Science Recordings), but how could I not? It's The Black Dog. Also not in the top ten is Manchester royalty Illum Sphere's lush Ghosts Of Then And Now (Ninja Tune). The minimal machines of Powell's Powell 11-14 (Diagonal) sent a buzz down my spine. A highlight of 2014 was Traxman's bold footwork stylings of Da Mind Of Traxman, Vol.2 (Planet Mu) (\"hey you, blow your whistle!\"), and I also found myself won over by instrumental grime, especially Slackk's Palm Tree Fire (Local Action) and Mr. Mitch's likeable Parallel Memories. And Kanye and Twigs-producing Arca made a good case for this whole charade being a top 20 with Xen (Mute).[Click here for the full top ten]5 – Objekt – Flatland (PAN)This appears to be a band name designed by committee. Still, the dark breaks and snarling techno of Objekt’s Flatland demonstrate a production control and singularity of vision I’ve not heard since Flying Lotus’ early work.The menacing lope of Dogma, the busy electro of Ratchet, the retro techno disco of album highlight Strays: this is more than just atmospherics and delay. It’s control. It’s precision.It’s Aphexian entertainment from the underbelly of electronic music that's certainly not for everyone, but with more musicality than you’d expect considering its bleakness, Flatland is everything a techno album should be in 2014.[Click here for the full top ten]Some also-ransA very significant omission from this year's top ten is Flying Lotus because, despite the dizzying delight of You're Dead! (Warp), he's ploughing a jazz furrow I'm not inclined to walk down. No space here either for Perc's nice and nasty The Power And The Glory (Perc Trax). Mr Scruff had his first studio album for five years with Friendly Bacteria (Ninja Tune), but he was one of several Ninja Tune artists that didn't make the cut, all of whom produced output that didn't match their last offering: Machinedrum's Vapor City Archives (Ninja Tune), FaltyDL's In The Wild (Ninja Tune) and Martyn's The Air Between Words (Ninja Tune). Wow. That's some big names ticked off. Oh and cheese, cheese, spray-on cheese put me off two great artists: Todd Terje's It's Album Time (Olsen Records) and Shit Robot's otherwise fun We Got A Love (DFA).[Click here for the full top ten]"},
{"title": "Best electronic albums of 2014: six", "date": "Dec 29, 2014", "text": "6 – Plaid – Reachy Prints (Warp)So far, this top ten has been dour. Not without soul, but certainly moody. Thank goodness for Plaid.Their tenth album in 25 years has a light touch, perhaps their lightest and most listenable, and it arrives in the wake of orchestral collaborations that have perhaps encouraged a few theatrics. So we have jingling bells, swooping dynamics, and an Orbitalesque earworm in Matin Lunaire.Reachy Prints grew on me slowly. It’s better when it’s toned down, where the pleasure is found in the subtleties and not the hooks. But I’ve found myself returning to it repeatedly. Such is their genius.[Click here for the full top ten]Some also-ransThere are a number of collaborative projects that didn't make my top ten this year. The Bug's comeback album Angels & Devils (Ninja Tune) received rave reviews, but I wasn't quite convinced by the vocalists on offer. Even less successful were the vocals on SBTRKT's disappointing Wonder Where We Land (Young Turks). Shame. Royksopp's probable swansong The Inevitable End (Dog Triumph/Wall Of Sound) was a little too coffee-table, although I love their partnership with Robyn. Two of my heroes, Eno / Hyde, gave us Someday World and High Life (Warp) which left me cold. Also-ran nods go to the heroin r’n’b of Matthewdavid's In My World (Brainfeeder), the Walls / Daphne Oram library reworking Sound Houses (Ecstatic), and Com Truise's so-so Wave 1 (Ghostly International) which was probably more an EP than an album.[Click here for the full top ten]7 – Kassem Mosse  – Workshop 19 (Workshop)Tinkle tinkle tinkle. Donk. Pootle pootle. Spap.That’s the sound of Gunnar Wendell’s debut album as Kassem Mosse. Stripped down percussion with trap influences meets techno-infused house with a result that is surprisingly catchy, all underpinned with a club urgency. He works with a limited analogue sound range but still manages massive keyboard riffs, stomping builders*, throbbing acid and tinkling ambience.The record gets darker the further in you get, so perhaps the tension dissipates, but the result is way more than the sum of its deep house parts. Finally, he has an album to suit his enviable live reputation.* Not actual builders stomping their feet, obviously. I was going to clarify this within the paragraph, but I'm trying to keep these reviews to exactly 100 words. These words don't count as part of that. Ignore all these words. Ignore them. Move on. [Click here for the full top ten]Some also-ransHere are some more albums that didn't make the top ten. Fhloston Paradigm's The Phoenix (Hyperdub) was cinematic yet erratic, while in contrast, Cooly G's vocal-heavy Wait 'Til Night (Hyperdub) was too straight laced for me. Steffi's Detroit-drizzled second album Power Of Anonymity (Ostgut Ton) was certainly in the running this year. A few house albums: Session Victim's See You When You Get There (Delusions of Grandeur) had way too many bongos; Mr. Oizo's The Church (Brainfeeder) is as head noddy as you remember his yellow puppet being; Mark E's Product Of Industry (Spectral Sound) pretty much sounded like Mark E. The bloke from Shed gave us fantastic bass-heavy simplicity with Head High's Megatrap (Power House), and I had real fun with the horro techno on Gesloten Cirkel's Submit X (Murder Capital). Finally for this segment, I have a real soft spot for Jungle. Their eponymous debut (XL Recordings) was all sorts of pleasant but a bit too thin for a long player.[Click here for the full top ten]"},
{"title": "Best electronic albums of 2014: eight", "date": "Dec 29, 2014", "text": "8 – Call Super – Suzi Ecto (Houndstooth)This is probably the only record in the top ten on which the artist’s dad has tooted a clarinet.Suzi Ecto is Call Super’s debut album, and it’s full of drifting, organic pop-length explorations with real world sounds and real instruments. There is experimentation, for example the chirrups fighting with biting synths on Rosso Dew or the stuttering chimes on Fold Again At Last.But amid the hisses and the crunches, amid the wooziness, there is more to grab onto than is first apparent. This album left me feeling we’re in a new classic era of ambient techno. Actually super.[Click here for the full top ten]Some also-ransA couple of Call Super labelmates didn't make the cut, specifically the heavy production of the songs on Throwing Snow's Mosaic (Houndstooth) and the low-rolling bass notes of Second Storey's Double Divide (Houndstooth). Vessel chopped up bicycles to make Punish, Honey (Tri Angle), but the results weren't as techno as I'd hoped. There was much to like with the precise electronics of Thug Entrancer's Death After Life (Software Recording Co.). Brilliant grimester Wen missed out on the top ten by a millimetre with his excellent Signals (Keysound) - he's probably 11th on the list. Luke Vibert was back with Ridmik (Hypercolour), showing you 303 ways to manipulate a 303. I always expected Plastikman's live album EX (Mute) to be in the top ten, but this expansive and epic LP ended up at about the 15 to 20 mark. And bless him, but Tycho's Awake (Ghostly International), his follow-up to 2011's memorable Dive, was too caught between being accessible post-rock and something you could sing Coldplay to.[Click here for the full top ten]"},

Here are the curators of the actual tent he’s talking about. Nearly 20 years after their pulsating single Positive Education rocked dancefloors, the Glasgow duo’s fifth album is a luxurious slab of classic ambience leading into tweaking acid thumpers that kick their hardware sequencers in the shins and then some.While fellow godfathers of dance may have gone disco or prog (yawn), Slam keep the bass drum at the fore. A complete journey with a single focus on driving, tuneful, hypnotic techno.Here, Limmy. It’s right here.[Click here for the full top ten]Some also-ransDorian Concept produced a likeable, dynamic electronic pop album with Joined Ends (Ninja Tune). Taylor Mcferrin's Early Riser (Brainfeeder) had a little too much smooth soul for my taste, while Skrillex's Recess (Big Beat) didn't even get a play because it had too much Skrillex for my taste. The simple bleeps of DMX Krew's Reith Trax (Rush Hour) didn't make the top ten despite being recorded on a farm. No space for the textured, messy ESTOILE NAIANT (Warp) by Patten either. Finally for this segment, the following albums were a little too pastoral: Barnt's tappy EBM album Magazine 13 (Magazine), Loscil's coastal found sounds on Sea Island (Kranky) and Teebs' organic and glistening E s t a r a (Brainfeeder).[Click here for the full top ten]10 – Untold – Black Light Spiral (Hemlock Recordings) Sonic destroyer Untold prowls the basement of the music scene. Sometimes he pops up to work with the likes of LV, Roska and R&S Records, but he mostly prowls the sewers picking up scraps of dubstep and fashioning them into spiky, confident bass music such as his 2009 work for Hotflush Recordings.His long-awaited debut album was, therefore, a curveball. Who knew that underneath the sewers were darker, more dangerous paths? On Black Light Spiral, we hear distorted electrocution (Strange Dreams), steamrollered reggae (Sing A Love Song) and Babadookian house horror (Doubles).All confidence gone: just introversion and overwhelming malevolence.[Click here for the full top ten]Some also-ransThere are so many albums that didn't make the top ten. I'll attempt to list most of them.Untold's other album Echo in the Valley (self-released) was a bit too experimental to be in the top ten. It was released on a USB stick y'know. I enjoyed the spectacularly-named Hieroglyphic Being And The Configurative Or Modular Me Trio's The Seer Of Cosmic Visions (Planet Mu), and part of me was in awe his second moniker I.B.M and the dense Eat My F*ck (Mathematics). More no-fi than lo-fi. Russell Haswell's noisy 37 Minute Work Out was inspired, it seems, by Paul Morley (Diagonal). Vladislav Delay returned to ambient on Visa (Ripatti Label), as did Function & Vatican Shadow on Games Have Rules (Hospital Records), although in a more industrial way. There was more claustrophobic murk on Ital's Endgame (Planet Mu), while labelmate Ekoplekz's Unfidelity (Planet Mu) may have had my favourite track title of the year (\"Robert Rental\") but its metallic noise didn't entirely click with me. Finally, I disqualified A Winged Victory For The Sullen 's Atomos (Erased Tapes) for being too classical, which is ridiculous because one of the top ten albums to come is definitely more than a little bit classical. Silly Fats.[Click here for the full top ten]I have decided. My top ten list of the best electronic albums of 2014 is complete. I think. Yes. Yes it is.I have missed some big names out.

It's not a real hat. Let's not get hung up on the hat. All the readers were great, but it was extra brills to have a Booker shortlistee read for Bad Language for the first time.The place was drizzled in orange and green lighting, giving a suitably pumpkinesque sheen for the 160 or so that attended. It felt quite austere, as though we were inside an old novel or something.I compered again at the King’s Arms in Salford for a Mother’s Ruin cabaret night. This was a chance to stretch my stand-up muscles, throwing in short routines, one-liners and, as usual, a truck-load of props. The night is described with aplomb here.Incidentally, my previous appearance for Mother's Ruin got a lovely review on Manchester's Finest:\"It was then time for Fat Roland, a comedian who again reduced the audience to hysteria from the start and all done without uttering a single word. Silently he took the audience on a tour about Manchester from doodles he’d drawn himself.\"Some of those drawings got a second outing at the Spoken Word Showcase in Salford. In some ways, this was the most interesting experience. I teased the audience with an idiot persona, with readings and doodles that were deliberately childlike. Once the audience was hooked – and who doesn’t love a low-status idiot – I allowed what I presented to become more skilful, ending on a dark and distinctly adult note that was entirely without punchline. Proper enjoyable.I have three events this week, so you should choose one at which you can show off your best hat. On Tuesday, I will read a fiction piece at a Bad Language / Blackwell’s collaboration with Tony O'Neill and Bluemoose Books. On Wednesday, it’s Bad Language at the Castle with Ralph Dartford from A Firm Of Poets. And on Thursday, it’s back to Blackwell’s where I will compere an evening of intelligent talks based around the Very Short Introductions books, run in conjunction with Oxford University Press.Photo: Pam Van-Damned"},

The irony of that title failing to reach the summit led to hundreds of floral tributes to be elastic-banded onto Simon Cowell's legs.McElderry went the way of Steve Brookstein. He was last seen doing panto. His career became as successful as JFK's is now.Enter this year's most interesting seasonal Facebook campaign:  LFO for Christmas Number One. LFO are sadly no more, after the death of sole musician and long-time Bjork collaborator Mark Bell (pictured above). He'll be sorely missed. LFO's Northern bleeps gave a voice to dour techno-heads and their eponymous debut on Warp Records should be regarded as one of the most influential electronic tracks of all time.A similar campaign for Altern-8's Activ 8 (Come With Me) faltered in 2013, charting the single 30 places lower than its original peak in 1991. The LFO campaign has a memorial element, and despite the Facebook page yet reaching the tens of thousands of followers it needs, there are plenty of shares and likes.Ah yes, the Facebook page. The other day, it posted a photo of Countdown lettersmith Rachel Riley displaying the letters L, F and O. All very amusing, Photoshop or no Photoshop.Among the quips about consonants and vowels, there were comments about Rachel, both in the group comments and in the shares of the original post by ex-LFO member Gez Varley. About her. About her appearance. Boobs and oscillations and the like. You've seen the internet. You know what comments are like.It made me feel sad. It reminded me that techno is male-dominated. It reminded me of the way debates are controlled and manipulated by men. It reminded me of pay gaps, of glass ceilings, of willies ruling all.That's a lot to read into a small selection of comments that were nothing to do with the campaign.But I like techno being a community. I liked going to a listening party for the new Aphex Twin album, or raving about favourite Orbital gigs, or gently prodding Venetian Snares fans about Westlife.But when technoheads are being misogynist, where are their friends? Why aren't they being challenged? Are we as blind to our willy-powered echo chamber as the blunt-fingered keyboard warriors of #GamerGate?I hope Mark Bell makes it to number one this Chrimbo. Meanwhile, I suspect McElderry's been more successful than this blog post has given him credit for. It doesn't matter. I'm still gaffer taping daffodils to Simon Cowell's hairy man tubes."},

We sat in rows with our chosen tools, in my case an A3 sketchpad I had bought that day and the pencil I used to illustrate a 2012 short story collection. A succession of models in fancy dress glared at us: we drew Storm from X-Men, an evil-looking Darth Maul and someone from Blade Runner.I didn't like it. It left me frustrated. I wanted to snap my pencil. I didn't snap my pencil. If you snap pencils, it releases lead into the atmosphere and a dolphin dies. I read that somewhere.The models were great, the night was friendly and fun, the costumes and make-up were brilliant, and the company I kept was great. I drew lots and, for a while, I enjoyed the challenge of squinting at the shapes before me and trying to spew that onto paper.Yet I learnt a few things:I DON'T DO REAL THINGS.I'd rather live inside my head. Things outside my eyes are boring. I need to mix things up into a beautiful field of horses or an elephant hick or a cheese goat Neil Buchanan mash-up or something so disgusting and weird it's probably NSFW.I DON'T DO SCHOOL.I won't sit still. I won't draw in a structured environment. I won't follow your recommendations to the letter. Don't give me an exam: I'd break it. I don't only think outside the box: I've opened a dictionary, crossed out \"box\" and written \"fnarp\" instead.I DON'T DO CLOTHES.Well. I wear clothes: I'm not a naturist. But I wanted actual life drawing not fancy dress. Models with skin and that. Nuddies. The sags and contours of skin are more interesting than leather jackets and capes. If you're not reading this naked right now, I'll be furious. Actually, I can see your reflection from my computer screen. My eyes. MY EYES.I DON'T DO CONVENTIONS.Despite this blog post using conventions of grammar on a template of a major blog publishing platform using equipment owned by multi-national corporations, I, like, totes don't do boundaries yeah?! Smash the system, yeah?! Fnarp blang-grabble toop p'dinb-dinb wam. That's not even a sentence. I'm out of control.MAYBE THIS IS WHY I LIKE BASS MUSIC.My dislike of following a crowd. My disrespect of popular conventions. My urge to always find the new. I feel restless.Maybe this is why I got into electronic music. I'll spend the afternoon trawling Bleep, loafing around Resident Advisor or spinning through Soundcloud for something new: Objekt or The Bug or Butch.Meanwhile everyone else is into fancy dress and normcore and real things and Ed Sheeran and Sunday lunch and saying how-do-you-do and wearing ties and television and breathing and jeezeverythingissoBORING.Anyway.

I was very interested in going on a school trip to France. I'd learnt the word boulangerie and everything.The trip was a nightmare. Some of my school \"mates\" were nobbists of the highest degree, and I spent the whole vacation feeling confused and overwhelmed. I still remember a supermarket cashier barking shapes at me while I nodded in a way I thought looked intelligent.I still do the same nodding now.Ever since, I've had an anxiety about not enjoying the moment. Such as dancing my mullet off in a club yet worrying about how many shirt buttons I should have unfastened, opting between one and two and three back to one like some kind of crap fabric traffic light.It's happened again recently, only in a more general sense. I've been caught in a cycle of logistics and planning and stress. Even when chillaxing with my bluds (I think these are French words), my mind has been a dripping pipe of mental notes and worries.Last weekend, that changed.I attended a writing workshop run by Prole Books at the turret-tastic Bodelwydden Castle. I only went because I followed Prole on Twitter and, hey, it was in a castle.I’m not really a workshop kind of guy, but the process loosened some pretty rusty bolts. I realise that clashes with my pipe metaphor, but shut up. Writer Sue Pace led the workshop without dictating, and allowed freedom to simply enjoy the process of writing.The weekend forced me to stop, to take a step back. I threw some priorities up in the air and let them land in a different order. I've written a lot. I’ve even been facing some tiny demons this week that I have been avoiding for a long time.I feel pretty.... boulangerie.---Also this week, I performed with Flashtag at Manchester Literature Festival in a kind of literary human centipede which was, according to reviews, comedic and hilarious.

Or perhaps it's a load of, er, hot air.I did a bit of digging around.The publicity stunt follows a successful Caustic Window Kickstarter campaign that saw £67,000 raised to release a rare 1990s test pressing. The latest missive from the campaign - I'm one of the backers - just mentioned some housekeeping details about a DigiPack release and mentioned nothing of a Pink Floyd-style PR coup.I rang Oval Space, who are hosting Aphex's label mate Rustie next month for the debut of Rustie's new album Attak. I asked them if the blimp was anything to do with them. They issued a quick denial and told me it was a marketing exercise by Warp Records.Maybe he's just DJing at Oval's LDN Craft Beer Festival this weekend. Maybe this means all those unreleased albums are ready to go. Maybe - and most likely considering what Oval Space told me - it's to do with Warp's 25th anniversary celebrations.Either way, I think we can conclude that Aphex Twin is launching an aerial assault on London and we should all run for our lives.Aphex blimp photo: NMEFurther Fats: Aphex Twin."},

{"title": "\"But you made the quiches yourself\": becoming a better stage performer", "date": "May 31, 2014", "text": "THE FAILURE.The stage lights burning the back of my eyes. The solitary microphone and the stares from the audience. And the sudden and lurching gap in my memory.I remember my only attempt at stand-up comedy well: I died on my backside: a brutal failure. The years have not diminished my shock at the experience.The next time I took to the stage was for Bright Club with a comedy lecture called Gospel According To Aphex Twin. It wasn't stand-up but I played it for laughs and I shook like a leaf. Four years later and, for the first time ever earlier this week, I had a \"performer moment\". A moment where I wasn't just on a stage reading funny stuff, but I used a learned technique to elicit a response from an audience. Like a Performer, capital P.THE MOMENT. The moment happened as I compered Bad Language. A couple of open mic acts hadn't turned up, and at one point there was a risk that it could have derailed the night. I needed to make light of the situation on stage, so I used a stupid metaphor, explained slowly with the best deadpan I could manage. I likened the no-shows to me making five quiches for a dinner party, with only four guests turning up, leaving me to eat the final broccoli-filled quiche even though I hated broccoli.And then came a friendly heckle. \"But you made the quiches yourself.\"\"Sorry?\"\"But you made the quiches yourself.\"The heckler shot my metaphor down with brilliantly-timed wit. I couldn't fight the logic. Why would I make a quiche I hated the taste of? THE CLICK. Something clicked. For the first time, I could use a heckle to gain a bigger laugh. I feigned a dawning realisation at the audience member's insight, and while I acted this out, my mind wrote a punchline. The punchline went something like: \"This is what my life has come to: me making quiches I hate for people that don't exist.\"As I spoke the punchline, keeping my timing regular and my voice steady, my brain went into planning mode again. I decided that after the word \"exist\", I should turn from the microphone. A visual full stop to land the phrase with a decisive thunk. It worked. People laughed.It was only a small moment, and by writing all this out, I am probably overplaying it. I'm also not trying to tell you how hilarious I am. The point is this: what struck me about that moment was  I could multi-task my little brain gremlins to enable me to plan mid-performance. I'd not done that before. I felt like a stand-up. THE FUTURE.The heckler apologised afterwards, but he didn't need to. I thanked him for making it funnier than it ever could have been.I guess the moral is that performance skill can be learned, that's probably worth trusting the moment, that a strong-enough stage presence can withstand almost anything.There are many stage performers better than me. But sometimes it's nice to look back and see how far you've come - because the energy I still get from that long-past stand-up failure still drives me to be a better performer today."},

Kind of new. A bunch of old test pressings under the Aphex alias Caustic Window have been gathering dust since the 1990s. The owner has now decided to release the recordings, and with the permission of all concerned parties, a Kickstarter campaign has started for anyone wanting to own a digital copy.BEGINNINGS. The fundraising idea began as a speculative survey on the legendary We Are The Music Makers (WATMM) forum, and it's now the owner of that forum, Joyrex, who is coordinating the campaign for these lost recordings to see the light of day.Joyrex, himself named after Caustic Window releases, said on the forum:\"I think any Aphex Twin fan (myself included) would dearly love for Richard to release any new material, and for whatever reasons he hasn't yet, this is an opprotunity for the fans to let Richard know there is a demand for even his older material.\"This may not mesh well with Richard's personal wishes (there was probably a reason he didn't commercially release this), but since this is fan-driven, if anything, it will convey to him and the labels the fans are willing to support their favourite artists in unique ways.\"BLESSINGS.Richard D James, aka Aphex Twin, gave his blessing to the project, as did Rephlex label boss Grant Wilson-Claridge. That in itself is remarkable: Grant himself told this blog two years ago that it would be nice if more attention could be paid to non-Aphex things. He's right, of course. Dave Monolith produced one of the best albums of recent years and Bochum Welt is rarely far from my earbuds.The original idea was for the digital Caustic Window release to be limited to a few hundred backers, but that has now been opened up and the campaign is fast approaching the $20k mark. You can donate here. The original recording will eventually be auctioned, and there is a plan to split those proceeds between Richard James, the Kickstarter supporters and charity.BURGERS.

{"title": "Blog your spleen out (with added Balki)", "date": "Apr 10, 2014", "text": "I have been tagged in an awful meme by Tim Footman, and I hate myself enough to rise to the bait. The hook is in the flesh of my cheek. Now pull.To make this more palatable, I have peppered this blog post with pictures of Balki Bartokomous from Perfect Strangers. Let's just get through this, shall we?WHO / WHAT ENCOURAGED YOU TO START BLOGGING?My ex-journalist ego, probably. Also a man called James and a colourful feline.Blogger is like a washing machine: ugly, noisy and most of the buttons never get used. One of its more bizarre functions is a 'next blog' button which transports you instantly to another blog anywhere in the world, regardless of subject matter or language. In the days before BuzzTube and TwitBook, this is how I used to discover blogs. Click, click, click.One of the blogs I was transported to was James and the blue cat, a writing fellow. I probably found him nestled between a Korean knitwear site and a fishing holiday journal. I made a tentative foray into the blogosphere because I wanted to be where other writers were, and I wanted to talk about my DJing. There was Quinquireme too. And Cultural Snow.HOW DID YOU CHOOSE WHAT TOPICS TO BLOG ABOUT?I didn't. My first post was in November 2004 and I did tend to plug what I was doing, but it wasn't until 2009 until I renamed it Fat Roland On Electronica and I focused on music previews, Warp Records and various noise noodlings that the blog got any attention.Blogging is different now - Upworthy, for example, is about click-quantity over content-quality. I've changed the name of my blog and I no longer analyse stats other than an annual auditing process (clicks-per-post down 3% in 2013, dontcha know). The success I gained from blogging now keeps me busy enough to prevent me from blogging as much as I'd like. It's a good problem to have.WHAT IS SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU?I once went to Manchester University students' union to interview Travis, but I forgot to put a tape in my dictaphone, so I says \"sorry chaps\" and never saw them again. A couple of years later, they released The Man Who. In the pantheon of an ever-pedestrian rock scene (thank crap for the Arctics), I now blame Travis for the downfall of rock which is why I stole a time machine from David Bowie to steal that blank tape from past-me.WHAT THREE WORDS DESCRIBE YOUR STYLE?Susan techno horse.WHAT DO YOU LOVE TO DO WHEN YOU'RE NOT BLOGGING?Are you chatting me up, question? You're such a flirt, question. That's a cute curl you've got on your mark, question. Maybe you and me should go on a date sometime. I'm seeing an exclamatory remark right now, but I can't see that relationship going anywhere because, frankly, no-one likes shouting in restaurants. You're not going to be needy, are you, question? Oh. Don't reply then. Fine. I'll snap off part of your mark, make it into a semi-colon. See if I care. Got to go. Exclamatory remark's calling for me. So loud.THE ENDWas that alright, Balki?No, says Balki."},

A few days ago, I hosted my first one. The quality of the open mic acts and the headliner, Stephen May, left me somewhat staggered. I performed in a ridiculous hat given to me by this man.I also got to host a proper discussion with proper writers. I invented this event for Manchester Histories Festival, and the quality of readers and the turnout re-staggered my mental innards all over again. I topped it off with a radio show yesterday alongside my writing cohort David Hartley.In the spare time I have had, I saw a great show by Jackie Hagan, I've been listening to old techno, I visited Crosby beach to see the strange iron blokes and I bought a bagel on Brick Lane.Look to the horizon.

{"title": "My Harder Better Blog Writing Tour Faster Process Monday Fats ", "date": "Feb 17, 2014", "text": "There's a blog tour going around like some kind of Swedish/Danish eco terrorist plague. You can see previous postings of this by Daniel Carpenter, who tagged me, Sarah Jasmon, David Hartley, Iain Moloney, Simon Sylvester, Kathleen Jones and many other writers.The tour has been called various names, mostly My Writing Process, Blog Tour and Blog Tour Monday. I wanted my contribution to be part of my Harder Better Faster Fats series. So I shall call mine the somewhat catchy My Harder Better Blog Writing Tour Faster Process Monday Fats.First, as in the rest of this series, let's start with a soundtrack:WHAT AM I WORKING ON?“The humans are busy today. They scurry.” Nuke (unpublished)Everything and/or too much.I’m the type of person who needs activity. Friends will know me to be a prolific finger-in-pie merchant, careening from studio to stage, from tweeting to designing to doodling.The one thing I learned about myself in the hurricane of the last ten years is that I have a pathological terror of boredom. And so I create and create and create, sometimes to the detriment of my immediate environment and my health.Therefore, 2014 will be a strange year. It will be a year in which I aim to take on new commitments; the kind of commitments which are as exciting as anything else I do but will also mean that other people will rely on me.This means less careening; less cascading from one unrelated thing to another. If the year goes well, I will also have crammed under my belt the best part of short story collection of entirely new work.HOW DOES MY WORK DIFFER FROM OTHERS IN ITS GENRE?“A worm tries to burrow into my face. All it finds is cold, irritated human skin, a football field of blotches.” Norway (Peirene Press, 2013)Let me answer that as honestly as I can.Unrelenting bullying in primary and secondary school led me to build two robust self-defence mechanisms: food and humour. The former I abuse, and the weight you see hanging off my bones can be considered a form of self-abuse. The latter I express through wit and performance to the delight, mostly, of friends and audiences.Add to this a sharp sense of tragedy due to the sudden death in my teens of my brilliant and incredible mother, stir once, cover and simmer.Many writers will baulk at the thought of being lumped into a ‘genre’ and I will do the same. But how does my writing differ? The comic-tragedy and darkness of what I do comes from a place that is real and raging within; when this doesn't come through in my work, I'm either not trying or I have failed.WHY DO I WRITE WHAT I DO?“The other day, she crushed a bauble until it burst into powder. The cuts on her palm were invisible and stung like hell.” And This Is My Mother (Merry Gentlemen, 2013)I grew up on a diet of joke books and Edward Lear, of the Ying Tong Song and the Ning Nang Nong. I’ve also always loved novels and short stories, from literary to comic to horror, and my first memory of secondary school was getting an A+ for a short story about the London Underground.I’ve never not thought of myself as a writer; indeed, my first proper job was on a newspaper, an experience that solidified some key elements about my approach to writing fiction:- Life is absurd;- Life is tragic;- Stories are infinite;- You can achieve a lot in very few words;- Structure in writing is everything;- I wish I didn't need deadlines, but I do.HOW DOES MY WRITING PROCESS WORK?“You look old, he says instead of thinking. You look old and almost dead.” Hoops (unpublished)I’m writing this at 4am having been awake since an early-evening snooze that left my body clock wilted and useless, Dali-like. So here I am, under my duvet, in my pants, listening to the rain on the window and wondering if I will ever sleep again. I wouldn't call this \"process\" but it has certainly given me the space to come up with a new short story idea about a fantastical cavity search. Result!My writing process involves:- notebooks;- backs of envelopes;- phone notes;- my laptop;- my home PC;- early alarm calls;- testing stuff out live;- short walks;- long walks;- dreams;- a constant fear of death;- too many Bic biros for one man;- and a dogged restlessness that some may find exhausting. Fingers in pies, fingers in pies.It boils down to getting down the word-count, but being clear in my vision of what I want to say before my bum hits the seat.IN SUMMARYAnd with this fourth instalment, the Harder Better Faster Fats series comes to an end. Forgive me if I don't tag anyone to continue this particular branch of the blog tour.Earlier in this post, I mentioned my two self-defence mechanisms. Both could be my downfall. My overeating is a considerable creative block and a continuing struggle, while on a lesser note, humour is an easy refuge from the apocryphal vein-opening gushing that 'truthful' writing is meant to require.Back in my journalism days, Bjork said in an interview something along the lines of this: she destroys herself at the end of the day, then rebuilds herself all over again.I love that as a coping mechanism for all the detritus that life splashes at us. Like the refrain of All Is Full Of Love, it's an idea that has circled and circled in glorious repetition over my life for many years.Destroy, renew.Destroy, renew.Create, create, create.(Pictured: Bjork)(Fiction excerpts: me)"},

I didn't win but I got some good laughs.2.Chased a shoplifter down the street like Officer Dibble and/or something in a Quentin Tarantino movie. Well, actually, my bookseller colleague Dave and I walked down the street asking to look in his bag and then he pegged it.3.Properly got into this Cashmere Cat track (Wedding Bells is out this week on LuckyMe).4.Performed to a packed-out room at Write It: Mic It, in which Poleroid Theatre trawled themselves up from London to host a brilliantly entertaining evening of literary and dramatic performance,5.Have been nominated on this blog tour by Daniel Carpenter, which seems to be spidering over the internet like a very slow but determined spider and/or number of spiders exerting the same effort as one very slow but determined spider. I'll write my piece soon.6.Bought my first ever Lydia Davis book on the strength of one tweet. Who needs useless Amazon reviews, huh? I think I'm going to enjoy it.7.Looked at my laptop and thought: why am I too tired to write? And then thought about Lydia Davis. Then thought about all the ideas in my head. And looked at my laptop. And thought again about writing and not writing.8.Scribbled a bunch of critique notes on my writer chums' novels (pictured). Which is the main reason why I haven't blogged for a few days.9.Saw Stewart Lee do a gig in Salford. Actually, it was more than a week ago, but it's on this list because it's the best I've ever seen him. He took his ironic meta deconstruction schtick to a whole new level with a brilliant, precise and lengthy heckler put-down.10.Asked a guy in a theatre dressing room what kind of thing he did on stage, having no idea whether he was a dancer, comedian, poet, singer or fire-breathing Adrian Chiles impersonator. He replied with some gravitas: \"contemporary\". Theatre's brills, innit.(Top picture by Mothers' Ruin.)"},

It's fair to say that the character I represent here is a mixture of the real me and some fictional extreme version of me that sweats Windowlene in a basement.Before I carry on, get this beautiful piece of electronica down your eartubes. It's a Plaid choooon from a soundtrack from a few years ago.(Read previous instalments of Harder Better Faster Fats here.)NUKE.I've always loved fiction. I love storytelling and strange worlds; the hopes and horrors conjured from authors' minds. I'd always written stories, but it wasn't until the ego-boost of the 2010 Manchester Blog Awards (during which I threatened to nuke one of my rivals) that I took my creative writing seriously.My arrival on the fiction scene began quietly with a story about tooth fairies for 330 Words, published 11 days after the blog awards and featuring a photo taken at the ceremony.I followed that with a modest call to arms called The Beatoff Generation: Our Future Books Shall Bleed From Your Shelves Like A Hardback Elixir Reddened From An Embarrassment Of Grammatical Riches.ASS.I've since done 40 gigs in one year, put out a couple of books, been in a thing with Nik Kershaw in, experimented with online narrative and hauled my fat ass around some of the most bearded joints of Manchester.But like the track above, as time goes on, I'm calming down. I'm focussing. Or at least, that's the theory.VOM.It's my aim in 2014 to produce enough stories for a collection. So that means fewer performances - or at least, fewer open mic slots - and a stinking pile of first draft wordvom each month. I call that a promise. I might even write it down to make it realerer.Publishers will suggest I write a novel. More routes in. But I'm going to focus on what I enjoy, not because I like faffing around and don't like success, but because I have to what I want to do. It's the one thing to which I'm driven, above my scuba diving, barbershop quartetting and time travelling.ELBOWS.I need this like Justin Biebpipe needs notoriety. Like Prince needs a lawsuit. Like, er, Liam from One Direction needs elbows. I am a worthless word-basher. This year, I will write more and I will read more. Nothing else matters.There are some obstacles in my way, and they're related to my reason to write. These will be the subject of the next Harder Better Faster Fats.Yeah.

In a cake way.Fractions is a series of short videos featuring simply animated and soundtracked abstracts of stories and ideas. It can be as weird as hell, which is how I like it. I had been writing a story for the 10th video, but idiot-inspiration (idiotspiration?) struck me when listening to internet radio.Manchester writers Anna Percy and Daniel Carpenter were banging on about literature on Fab Radio. I shoved a microphone at my computer speakers and, in my mind, dared them to say something silly. And then they started talking about pens.Within two hours, I had edited their voices and written music for it. See this alongside the rest of the Fractions videos here. And give Fab Radio your time: they're lovely people."},

{"title": "My problem with The Wolf of Wall Street", "date": "Jan 29, 2014", "text": "[SPOILERS]There's a film called Wolfy Wolf Street where Leonardo DiCaprio plays a he-wolf living on a street with other he-wolves while a load of she-wolves shave their fur off and howl at his request.Leo-Wolf is a bad wolf who buys a yacht and a helicopter and bad stock cubes that are a bit like catnip for cats except it's not cats, it's wolves. The film lasts sixteen days and it's directed by a martian called Scorcese.Martian-Scorcese is a man-martian and Leo-Wolf is a man-wolf and his sidekick is a Jonah-Wolf who's a wolf not a whale and he's a man-wolf too. There are lots of other men-wolves too numerous to remember because the martian man filled the film with as many men-wolves as he could fit in his imagination which is a lot because he's a martian.When Leo-Wolf feels sad or tired or weird on bad stock cubes, he's nasty to his she-wolf mate. It's as if she's not a she-wolf but a barometer to reflect the mood of Leo-Wolf: a wolf-reflection. There's a British she-wolf and she's there to make an incest joke and plot get-out point. And there's another she-wolf and she wears pink and it's important to know she's a single mother and she cries and she owes her success to the he-wolves.I don't think the martian likes she-wolves very much.Leo-Wolf is based on a real wolf called Naughty Belfox or something and he's a nasty fox which is why the wolves in the film are being nasty too. The eighty-hour film is set inside Leo-Wolf's eyes and they're really big eyes because there are buildings and oceans and stuff.The martian asks 'what does the fox say' and makes Leo-Wolf act it out, so it's not the martian's fault he doesn't like she-wolves. He's only really interested in telling the story of Leo-Wolf's character who's a nasty fox.Except the martian chooses to show full she-wolf nudity and no full he-wolf nudity. That's a directorial decision and you can't palm it off on blaming the main character.Except the martian decides that [SPOILER] the bit where Leo-Wolf stops using the bad stock cubes is skipped over completely. Which is odd because the film is fifty years long so the martian certainly had time to do that. Almost as if the martian *isn't* as interested in story as you might think but instead just wants to show lots of he-wolves howling and being horrible to she-wolves forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever.I liked that other film. The film about the woman in space going round and round and trying not to drive the space-bus under 40mph in case George Clooney explodes. The film was 51% her-astronaut and 49% him-astronaut and they kept showing pictures of the earth as if to say \"look, that is what the earth is made up of too\".That's MY earth, I thought when I saw the earth and thought about the earth.Maybe they should make more films like that."},
{"title": "Best electronic music of January 2014", "date": "Jan 27, 2014", "text": "I know what's going to happen. I'm publishing this on the last Monday morning of the month, and in about two hours, Thom Yorke will suddenly release a track with Venetian Snares (or something) and it'll be number one by Sunday,Daaaamn you, Yorkie.Let's give this a go anyway. It's not quite the end of January 2014, and I'm resigned to missing great stuff out in error, but here is the pick of the best electronic dance music this month.Also, I'm aware by numbering these in preference, I'm comparing single tracks with albums. Which is a bit like comparing a Dairylea slice with a juggernaut full of chalk, but, er, um, shut up.The best electronic music of January 2014:1 - MODERAT - LAST TIME (JON HOPKINS REMIX) (MONKEYTOWN)Hopkins, who is no stranger to the number one spot on this website, goes slo-mo acid with devastating effect as this track morphs into an epic designed to hypnotise. Tip of the fedora too to Moderat, that Modeselektor and Apparat collaboration that bowled me over with last year's Bad Kingdom (video still pictured above)  Listen.2 - MOUSE ON MARS - BAKERMAN IS BREAKING BAD (MONKEYTOWN)Monkeytown acid again! A silly acid bath of a track, by which I mean 'acid bath' in a good way, not in a murderous way. It's dirty and trippy and it's good to have the mice back. Listen.3 - ACTRESS - GHETTOVILLE (NINJA TUNE) (album)If this really is Actress' last album, it's a bit of a party pooper. Shuffling and claustrophobic loop variations. He saves the more comfortable upbeat motifs for later. Glorious in its miserablism. Listen.4 - KAUMWALD - HANTASIVE (OPAL TAPES)Dark field recordings filtered through the anus of hell, droned into your veins like a syringe of diseased noise. An essential 12\" if you like obscure techno. Listen.5 - SHACKLETON - FREEZING OPENING THAWING (WOE TO THE SCEPTIC HEART)Detailed, almost mathematical, percussion on this EP from dubstep label pioneer Shackleton. He allows the simple repetition plenty of space to tap little holes into your brain. Listen.6 - LEE BANNON - ALTERNATE / ENDINGS (NINJA TUNE) (album)Dense drum 'n' bass album scattered with a warehouse rave sensibility. I suspect this one will grow on me throughout the year. Listen.7 - BIBIO - THE GREEN (WARP RECORDS)Bibio's pastoral leanings faded on me a bit over the past few years, but this EP is loaded with beautiful melody. Listen.8 - FALTYDL - DANGER (NINJA TUNE)Check that LTJ Bukem sample on the A-side. On the flip side, King Brute is rough and gravelly: it sounds like a purring cat's inside your speakers and it has KNIVES. Listen.9 - D/R/U/G/S - ECHORAVEYou can't go wrong with a bit of melodic dancefloor techno, and D/R/U/G/S does it better than most on this EP of collected muzoid scraps. Listen.10 - VARIOUS - BANGFACE: NEO-RACE ARMAGEDDON (BANGFACE) (album) Bangface scares me. It makes me long for Coldplay and cardigans and Watercolour Challenge. Actually, that's a lie. This is a December release but I've included it here because it is day-glo and stoopid and ace. Nice one, chop one, snorted. Listen."},

{"title": "Harder Better Faster Fats: Blogging a.k.a. spurting your eyes, blood-style", "date": "Jan 22, 2014", "text": "Last week, I revealed my unease about 2013. I said I'd blog my way through that unease, because if blogging isn’t about opening a vein and spurting liquid innards into the surprised face of the reader, then what is it for?Before we get stuck into this week’s execrable navel-gazing, here’s a track you should listen to.I neglected this blog last year partly because of my entirely worthy work with Electronic Sound and Now Then Manchester (you should read both). The latter published an interview I did with The Orb. Lawks! Meanwhile, this site shrivelled  A METAPHOR.Here’s a metaphor.Imagine a hugely promising contestant on The Voice. Week after week, the contestant soars and thrills to the delight of the judges.In one fateful week, the contestant comes on naked, covered in peanut butter, and riding miniature unicycle circles on top of Tom Jones’ sturdy hair. No-one would enjoy it. Not even me. Everyone would say, “I liked it when Fats was clothed and singing.”Last year, my blog stopped singing and instead it donned the peanut bu-- wait, is this metaphor working? Should I put my clothes on? Sit STILL, Tom.THE MEANING OF IT ALL.Although my non-blogging work continues to be fun and exciting, I missed blogging here.I don’t know whether it’s the instant validation of comments and stats, whether it’s the therapeutic nature of structured writing, or whether it's because have a massive ego and if it was the 1700s, I’d be building follies instead. I just know that I like writing in this format.Listen to that track. Caribou’s Sun is a track frozen in my memory as playing over Deaf Institute speakers into my drunken brain after the Manchester Blog Awards in 2010. A focus amid the haze.Blogging feels like that focus. Amid the chaotic, diagonal leglessness of life, it's that little, repeated thing that keeps me grounded.\"Sun, sun, sun,\" I slurred while dribbling into my beer.RELAUNCH. My first move this year was to relaunch this blog for a ‘world wide Buzzfeedernet’ (broadsheets, you can have that phrase). Shorter paragraphs, morewhitespace, and a posting schedule that savesFriday for fluffier, more visual stuff.It's going alright. Fat Roland on Electronica was tied to a pre-EDM outlook. Netloafer has loosened things up. It's already earned a plug from MC Hammer on his Twitter feed (hello to my new readers: sorry it's not that hip hop).This was a rather whimsical blog post. My fiction writing is tighter than that, honest.Which, incidentally, will be the subject of the next instalment of Harder Better Faster Fats.(Pictured: Caribou)"},

{"title": "Four Tet's ten-minute beat challenge", "date": "Jan 20, 2014", "text": "If your laptop is loaded with Ableton or Garageband, the musician’s concept of being “in the studio” is a nonsense. The studio follows you around like a randy dog, constantly rubbing its icon in your face every time you log on.Which is why Kieran Hebden, known better as Four Tet, seems to be in a corner of his living room in this ten-minute beat challenge (video below). I’m half expecting a hoover to appear screen-right at any moment.In this challenge, he has to create a passable beat against the clock. He needles his way through fragments of Thriller on a record player he seems to have stolen off a child, then slices and filters the results to create Four Tet’s knife-sharp house music motif.Here’s the video. I’ll spew out some thoughts beneath.OTHOUGHTS ON FOUR TET'S BEAT CHALLENGE.1. Although he finds some super sweet sounds, he’s right when he says that lead motif is too much. It’s still better than anything I could do. Obviously. Because he’s mother-flumping Four Tet.2. I use Ableton too, and it’s good to see he uses similar techniques to me: finding the groove; letting things clash until something clicks; tweaking and tweaking and tweaking.3. He has a mouse from the 1920s.4. With such clipped samples, it’s a reminder to all music makers that less is more.5. Spooling through vinyl like that is an honourable way to make music, as this brilliant documentary on the Amen break will show.6. Why would you hoover a wooden floor?

I am also going to make you listen to this:AN INTRODUCTION. Underworld's Always Loved A Film makes me feel nostalgia mixed with a tickling, bubbling hope that fizzes from foot to groin to noggin. It's in this spirit that I present this week's 'Harder better faster Fats'. Yes, that's what I'm calling it. Shut up.So then. By way of an introduction: I feel uneasy about 2013.Despite brilliant high points such as Fat Roland’s Electric Shorts and the Edinburgh Fringe, it’s left me with an uneasy feeling. I joined an amazing writing group, did some really fun video and Twitter work, and some wonderful luck came my way. But I think I let opportunities slip.These blog posts will be me working out that slip.AN ANALOGY. Take the film trilogy Naked Gun.I love that those films because I am stupid. It was all so slightly off-the-rails and I love deadpan. But every time I watch it, I feel that I could be watching Airplane!, which is even better.Maybe that's what 2013 was like: Naked Gun when you could have been enjoying Airplane! If you're not familiar with that analogy, replace those film titles respectively with Bradley Walsh and Bradley Cooper, or the current series of Sherlock with any other series of Sherlock.A PROMISE. I feel optimistic about 2014. I've made myself some promises. Little targets throughout the year to make the next 12 months more, well, less slippy.They will involve my writing and my focus and my health and some pretty deep crap. As I blog about it over the next few weeks, I'll accompany it with some of the most hopeful records I can find.(If this all sounds dangerously like therapy-through-blogging, then welcome to Netloafer...)If 2014 turns out as well as I hope, I'll be dancing around my hovel to the pulsating glory of Always Loved A Film whilst mentally crash-landing a plane with a blow-up doll, far far away from the wall-gnawing Lionel Blair dungeon.Now, that's hope...(Pictured: Underworld.)"},

Anyhoo, you can read the story by clicking on the big 22 here.I wanted to convey the theme of disappointment in as surreal a way as possible, yet using a recognisable festive occurrence: visiting a partner’s parents at Christmas.Sometimes there are things that come easily in a story. They tend to be images. (I should warn you of spoilers at this point so read the story first.) In this case:someone scrunching their face into screwed-up paper;his intensely annoying childishness;the subversion of Christmas things (crushing a bauble, punching carol singers);his “making it snow” moment happening ‘off-camera’;her feeling of existential angst while driving;and finally, the reveal in the hut, which was the first thing I came up with when writing the story.My next story?

He will have a reunion tour with himself but abandon it on doctor’s orders. He will die with Usher at his side.THERE WILL BE A NUMBER ONE SINGLE SO EYE-WATERINGLY SEXIST, A PERMANENT SCHISM WILL DEVELOP BETWEEN CONFIDENT, SEXUALLY-ACTIVE YOUNG MEN AND REPRESSED, PAUNCHY LIBERALS.The usual schism stuff. Arch looks at award ceremonies. Passive-aggressive lyric / Guardian article wars. Mud-wrestling. That kind of thing.HARRY STYLES WILL SET UP HIS OWN CULT.Harry Styles (pictured) will see Twitter feeds like Harry My Cat Died and Bad Harry Art. He will see an opportunity. After a series of top-level meetings with the Scientologists, which is a church and not a cult, he will buy the Scientology movement, which is a church and not a cult, and change the name of the Scientology movement, which is a church and not a cult, into The Styleologists. He will change it into a cult, because it is definitely a church, by changing absolutely nothing else whatsoever.NEW APHEX TWIN ALBUM.Ha ha. Only joking. In fact, what will happen is that Daft Punk will sell another million records with an Aphex Twin covers album. For the titles, they will take existing Aphex Twin titles and stick 'Get Lucky' on the end. For example, Donkey Rhubarb Get Lucky, Halibut Acid Get Lucky, andN∆Mᵢ⁻¹=−α ∑ Dᵢ[η][ ∑ Fjᵢ[η−1]+Fextᵢ [η⁻¹]]η=1 j∈C{ᵢ}Get Lucky.The music will be produced with similar care and attention. It will feature the return of Basshunter, Robert Miles, DJ Caspar and two members of Fleetwood Mac.COUNTRY AND WESTERN WILL GO DUBSTEP.Country and western music will thereby obtain widespread respect and support in Europe for the first time ever. A broadsheet journalist will coin the term ‘Dubstep Country & Western’, while the NME journo who thought of ‘C**t-step’, complete with asterisks, but didn’t get it into print in time will be fired and then thrown into a skip.What are your pop predictions for 2014?

Try that.However, if you want some music I found at the bottom of my Writer's Sick Bag (we all have one, right), then have a rummage. And remember: if it feels damp, that's a good thing.Here's a Spotify playlist based on some of the Fat Roland top ten albums of 2013 and some other things. There are two hours of music. Two whole hours! That's like... more than 12 minutes or something.Further Fats: Best electronic albums of 2013WelcomeWelcome to my live posting of what I reckon is the best electronic music of 2013.How this worksThere will be about nine or ten updates of this one blog post during New Year's Eve 2013. We start now and I'll slowly reveal my top ten albums until we hit the number one some time in the afternoon. Keep checking back here or follow the progress on Twitter.As with previous lists, there is no way my list is comprehensive. I may even miss some big albums because I am forgetful and slightly high on Windowlene. But any punk will tell you, daft or otherwise, that this has been a massive year for electronic music and I believe this list represents the most memorable, the most moving, the most affecting long-playing electronica of the year.Apologies in advance if the amount of text is more paltry than in previous years. I usually write all this well in advance, but 2013 hasn't afforded me that luxury. The panic-buy Windowlene queues took weeks out of my life. Instead, I have my list and I am writing this 'live'.Previous winners of my best album award have been Clark, Mount Kimbie (although it should have been Luke Abbott), Rustie, Andy Stott and Lone. Who will be this year's number one? Who cares? Where am I? What's that on my shoe? Who knows.Edit: See also the best electronic music of January 2014.10 - Factory Floor - Factory Floor (DFA)Journalists practically milked themselved shrivelsome over the tense industrial swagger of Factory Floor. Its post-punk sensibilities, drenched as it is in analogue synthesisers, percussive stabs and detuned vocals, encourage you to wiggle your shoulder pads in robotic-style on the dancefloor.The album probably reflects DFA Records maxim of \"too old to be new, too new to be classic\". It's written through with history and yet it's measured: it never lets its acid tweakery or drum foolery drown the memorable melodies throughout. LCD Soundsystem fans take note.9 - Chvrches - Bones Of What You Believe (Virgin)Such glorious, spangly 80s pop. You see, I never got on with Erasure. Too cold. But the moment I heard Lies for the first time, I understood that Chvrches was an electronic pop band that melded synthetic immediacy with emotion.This Caledonian trio probably wooed the indie set more than the EDM kids, but the electronics spark from the speakers because, in the construction of the rhythms that punch and snap, Chvrches understood what to leave out. 'Do a Miley' and lick off the saccharine sugar to find something mesmerising. In fact, forget Miley: this is the pop sound of 2013.Some also-rans (part one of four)Sometimes in a litter, a puppy has to die. Here are several puppies, all neatly snuggled inside a bin bag. Let's take a trip to the incinerator. (Sorry. What? The RSPCA have been on the line. They would like a donation every time you gasp at a brilliant album included in these top ten rejects.)I couldn't hook onto Oneohtrix Point Never’s Warp Records debut R Plus Seven enough (pictured) even though it's probably their most, er, immediate album yet. Maybe I wanted it to be more visceral, like Roly Porter’s brilliantly epic Life Cycle Of A Massive Star or intense and spiralling like Holden’s The Inheritors. None of these found space in my top ten.Jamie Lidell's Jamie Lidell just left me wanting Frank Ocean. There was much to be said for Tim Hecker’s harmonic and ambient Virgins, and the clanks and clicks of Logos' Cold Mission, while The Haxan Cloak's Excavation was slooooow and daaaaark. Finally, two genuine contenders that fell at the last hurdle were Forest Swords’ outdoorsy Engravings and fun drum 'n' bass chart botherers Rudimental with Home.8 - µ-Ziq – ChewedCorners (Planet Mu)Perhaps it's a blindness. Perhaps I don't want to hear the mixed reviews. Perhaps I'm distracted by track titles like Twangle Melkas, Tickly Flanks and Mountain Island Boner. But I'm having µ-Ziq's first album for six years in my top ten, dammit, because it sounds like the entire history of IDM ozzing from the pulsing heart of Planet Mu.It's a soft album in many ways, eschewing (sorry) hard-nosed posturing for warm textures and delicate yearning. Perhaps these are studio offcuts - chewed corners, indeed - but I like the taste because it's familiar. One for the IDM aficionado.7 - Autechre - ExaiI wish I knew why they released this download on Valentine's Day. It would only be suited to a romantic dinner if the candles were made of, um, angles and that. And the napkins were made of, er, awkward complications.Autechre's 11th album is hefty, with some long track times that allow for rhythmic and melodic developments missing from some of their other work. Dirty bass, nasty percussion and an over-arching feeling of being in another world; positively head-noddy in places. It's a kind of funk, but only if the funk is made of, er, um, napkins and candles. Wait. I've lost the metaphor. What?Some also-rans (part two of four)Here are some other albums that didn't make the top ten. M.I.A. was reliably electrotastic with Matangi (pictured), while Fuck Buttons' Slow Focus was suitably scuzzy. The bass music of Akkord's debut Akkord was in my top ten for most of the year, which is more than can be said for Raffertie's Sleep Of Reason, which was a little too hazy to grasp.Also missing out is the countryside psychedelia of Darkstar's News From Nowhere, Gold Panda’s pleasant house album Half of Where You Live and Mount Kimbie's warm Cold Spring Fault Less Youth. Crikes, they're dropping like flies.Also spat out from the final top ten is Pantha Du Prince & The Bell Laboratory's Elements of Light, which had far too many bells, Four Tet's Beautiful Rewind, which was enjoyable despite a lack of bells, and Omar Souleyman’s truly excellent, Four Tet-produced festival favourite Wenu Wenu. Sorry, Omar.6 - Boards of Canada - Tomorrow's Harvest (Warp)Boards of Canada achieved two things in 2013. With their first studio album for many years, they avoided the pastoral bleaching-out that may come with age. I'd suggest that if this had been their debut album, it would have had enough crawling melancholia to mark it out as classic as Music Has The Right To Children.And secondly, in the track Reach For The Dead, they provided me *the* spine-chilling musical moment of the year. This album reduced me to crumbs. That's not a sunrise on the cover. It's not a sunset. It's their music suffocating the world. If this is the sound of the post-apocalypse, the sound of tomorrow, then I welcome it with quivering arms.5 - James Blake - Overgrown (Atlas)This was the year in which James Blake shaved his head, got arrested for drugs and walked shirtless through airpor-- wait, no, I may be thinking of other people. Blake is in fact sensible. And he focuses on the music.Which may be why he confounded my expectations with a stupendously catchy and memorable follow-up to his ever-so-slightly disappointing 2011 debut.He has walked a fine line between singer-songwriter (yawn) and electronic innovator (yes). For Overgrown, he's drawn his own line by producing an inventive soul album that somehow puts the song and the electronics first. By jove, the Mercury judges got it right.Some also-rans (part three of four)Thundercat failed to rock my world with his Brainfeeder album Apocalypse (pictured). Heterotic's Love And Devotion had some amazing highlights but missed out on the final cut (but in all fairness, Paradinas was recording two albums at once - see number 8 in this list).It's a shame not to include two of my favourites, but they're albums worth checking out anyway: Machinedrum's Vapor City, with Gunshotta being a blistering highlight of 2013, and FaltyDL's lush Hardcourage. Apparat's theatre project Krieg und Frieden was interesting, and DJ Rashad's Double Cup was a footwork banger and no mistake.Karen Gwyer’s debut Needs Continuum was glistening, trippy experimentalism. And Samaris’s track Góða Tungl should turn the head of any James Blake fan, as should their beautiful album Samaris.4 - RP Boo - Legacy (Planet Mu)After all that cynical chin-scratching I did at my computer screen when Planet Mu threw their considerable weight behind footwork. What an idiot. In no way did I anticipate a footwork album that would entertain me from toe to toupee.RP Boo's debut album (it stands for Record Player, before you ask) is unlike anything else in this top ten. Typical of the genre, you get minimal percussion, all those little trills, cut-and-paste, cut-and-paste and yet there is something extra. The way he works the vocals makes this quite addictive, and it spins from comical to clinical with deft precision. As Record will tell you himself, this is red, red hot.3 - SCNTST - Self-Therapy (Boysnoize)A compelling, complete techno masterpiece and SCNTST is only twenty years old. When I reviewed this for Electronic Sound magazine, I called it a \"stupendously listenable debut\" with \"blistering control of the most basic of ideas\". I was wrong. The number of times I have returned to this album since means it is something better than that.Each track has its own character, whether its pulsing or thundering or skipping along cheerfully. It's techno to the core, and it's never far from a 4/4 beat, but Self-Therapy takes in jazz, hip-hop and ambience in a way that rarely wavers.The sampled mechanics of Percee Scan makes it sound like a hymn to photocopiers, while the operatic drama of Murder delights. He does a decent Plaid on Loqui. Even low-key house numbers like Throwback claw under your skin as the themes filter in and out, buzz and pulse, heave and ho. A self-assured, self-therapeutic debut that, if it doesn't hit you at first, will grow and grow and grow.Some also-rans (part four of four)The final selection of complete losers too pathetic to grace my top ten are as follows. Disclosure tried hard to revive the 90s but Settle (pictured) settled for a place outside the list. I enjoyed Pet Shop Boys' mostly-successful Electric return to form, which is more than I can say for Karl Bartos' indulgent Off The Record.Ikonika’s happy Aerotropolis was almost disco. Which brings me to, yes, disco. Oh boy. None of it made my top ten. Letherette's ace Letherette was as if Justice got good again while a lot of you loved Starcadian’s Sunset Blood (really?!) and Kavinsky’s Outrun. Which brings us to my biggest omission, 2013's king of disco......Random Access Memories. No, no, no, no, no. I suggested in May that Daft Punk's new-found success would come at a cost. I believe I was right. Shame. Let's move on.2 - Special Request - Soul Music (Houndstooth)Italian house. Brutal junglism. Drexciyan IDM. Rave breaks. Sirens. Techno. Grime. Buckets of dystopia and misery. Get all of that and stick it in your washing machine. No, I don't care if it's pants-wash day. Fast-cycle it. Now tip the result onto the kitchen lino. Have you made a mess? Good. Best get it cleared up before your New Year's party.Bad bwoy samples and jungle breaks blend and break on Special Request's astonishing debut album. Vintage gear and pirate radio underpins this brutal assault of musical memories and tributes. Baselines fart, breakbeats disappear into the upper register, vinyl fuzz cracks warm into the album's veneer.A breaks album that is interesting, innovative and exciting; both listenable and uncompromising. There are so many albums like this: the jungle truly is massive. But the Houndstooth label, brought to us by the Fabric nightclub and Rob Booth of Electronic Explorations, have the magic touch and this is possibly the strongest debut album of 2013 - and in a year as strong as 2013, that's saying something.1 - Jon Hopkins - Immunity (Domino)The best electronic album of 2013 comes from a classical pianist who played with Coldplay and was nominated for the Mercury Prize. I might as well award it to Michael Bublé.Jon Hopkins set his sights on the dancefloor for this release and yet the rhythms seem constructed from the static between the beats. He grabs wafer-thin sounds and ideas and polishes them up so brightly, it dazzles from start to finish. That breath near the start of Collider. It floored you, didn't it? The production is mind-blowing.And so emotive. The analogue yearning that made Luke Abbott's Holkham Drones so essential, or indeed Orbital's more ethereal moments, soars to new levels on Immunity. I know it's calculated and I suspect Hopkins has graphed this out to perfection, but energy and sadness and hope swell from every programmed moment of this album, from the thudding first half to the fragile second half. Played with precision. Paced to perfection.This has been the strongest year for electronic music for a while, and yet Jon Hopkins still ended up leagues ahead with Immunity. It's one of the best electronica albums for years. Just let's not talk about the Coldplay thing, yeah? What Coldplay thing? That's right. That's exactly right.Thank you for reading Fat Roland on Electronica. Edit: See also the best electronic music of January 2014."},

Any other blogs I have will be decomissioned (you have to get written consent from the Queen, apparently) and combined with this one. My other alternative was to knock blogging on the head, but I don't want to do that because my ego won't let me.The change in this blog will provoke in you two distinct reactions:Firstly, as the new design becomes apparent, you will vomit with joy and keep vomiting for the entirety of 2014.Secondly, as my music readers are faced with fiction writing and my fiction fans are faced with music writing, you will realise that this whole new-look blog has fallen between a rock and a hard place.And it shall be decreed that the rock shall be named PJ and the hard placed shall be called Duncan.

The mag for Future seemed to do quite well, but I'm probably not alone in thinking there's not an easy, er, future for niche print magazines unless they're about guitars or gaming. So the team behind the original print magazine have gone independent to launch issue one of Electronic Sound for the iPad.My column is a hilarious take on the Performing Rights Society: not exactly a minefield of comedy, but honestly, it's gigglesome.

{"title": "Review: Daft Punk's Random Access Memories", "date": "May 14, 2013", "text": "There are parts of Daft Punk's new album Random Access Memories I want to store in my RAM forever... but this is only part of the story.Let's get some context. For a band that has only released three albums, Daft Punk's effect on dance music has been stratosflippingpheric. Every French house band from Cassius to Letherette gets a Daft comparison.However their output over time, as they've moved from Revolution 909 to Aerodynamic to Robot Rock, has lost traction. You could argue their nadir was the Tron Legacy soundtrack, and even though the album itself it's much better than you think it is, the movie did translate as some kind of weird Bangalter-Christo vanity project.ArseThe problem with Daft Punk releasing a new studio album after all this time is the Justice Imperative. The Justice Imperative is where a great Parisian electronic music act - let's for argument's sake say, er, Justice  - feels the need to fall so in love with their own arse, they prog themselves until they disappear completely. Except it's not prog: it's more \"The Who teaming up with David Guetta\". Have Daft Punk fallen into the Justice trap?Tragically, yes. At least, to some extent.The clue is in the epic riff that opens Give Back to Music. The riff disappears quickly and we're into a disco jangle ripped straight from Get Lucky, which is also here in (thankfully) extended form. But remember that opening few seconds. It will return.PandaLet's start with the positive. Doin' It Right featuring Panda Bear is exactly what you'd want a DP / Animal Collective collaboration to sound like and it's brilliant. Slow, teasing, melodic and glorious. Lose Yourself In Dance is utter disco singalong, lifted by Pharrell Williams's vocals against the robots' cheerleading him with \"come on, come on\".Giorgio By Moroder starts, literally incredibly, with Moroder himself waffling at length about singing in discotheques and his lovely Moogs before launching into a spiralling, string-laden emotive nine minutes - a theme which is, incidentally, revisted on final track Contact. They spoil Moroder though with a bit of jazz noodling, but the track is pulled back with hi-hat-abusing live drumming that rises into a distorted acid shred climax.The rest of the album is either bold experimentation or .. well...MuppetsTouch is bonkers. We find ourselves in a Doctor Who horror hell, which then inexplicably morphs into Michael Ball in Phantom-mode, sinister strings and oodles of expansive trip hop. Vocals are by Paul Williams, who wrote the Muppets' Rainbow Connection, and that kind of makes sense and it's kind of brilliant or, more worryingly, it's something else. Parts of this track can be coupled thematically with Motherboard, which comes across as an ambient rhythmic UNKLE, its arpeggios the only clue as to it being Daft Punk track.And now the rest. The horrible, horrible rest.It's either bold experimentation or... this. That's what the opening riff alluded too. You're expecting 80s hair and flares and anything but a touch of Sade or Warren G, but there it is on Beyond which g-funks it up so much it's almost a total steal of Michael McDonald's I Keep Forgettin'. And The Game Of Love's guitar harmonic MOR barely sticks its head above 90bpm and it is smooth. Not just smooth, but Sade-smooth. We're talking Smooth Operator smooth. Okay, let's cut the crap: it's basically Smooth Operator.Instant Crush, an obvious single, could be an Avril Lavigne track when it starts out but it gives in to Europop territory with light Royksopp or Mew vocals. Utter cheese... but they've softened us up with Get Lucky, so it's less of a shock. Still. This is Daft Punk and they've lost da funk.AwfulFragments of Time is awful MOR pop - Todd Edwards should stay on the other side of the microphone - and the line on ballad Within which says \"there are so many things that I don't understand\" will seep into your subconscious all track long until you are diving for Teachers (the track and the drink) to make everything okay again.On Random Access Memories, the experimentation is sometimes brilliant, but it is all-too-often the sound of a band losing their confidence and losing their sound. There are parts of Daft Punk's new album I want to store in my RAM forever and some parts I'm going to need an anti-virus programme to purge.There is enough here to make this their biggest album to date. They've gained traction again - but at what cost?Further Fats: Please spell Freeland versus Daft Punk. \"OBAMA.\" (2009)"},

It's the attitude of real ale drinkers, broadsheet journalists and people who take BBC class surveys. These people should be shunned from society.However...At the height of 1990s Underworld when Born Slippy provided a pulsating soundtrack for every heroin lover everywhere, you would have found me harking back to their earlier stuff like a white-gloved, pill-popping Saxondale.\"Have you heard that lager, lager, lager track? It's rad to the club max. I can't wait to jive to its funky beats down the discohouse.\"\"I've heard it, yeah. I preferred Rez.\"\"Oh stick it up yourself.

He locked himself away and came up with Rez. What he produced was an antithesis to all the bog standard 12-inch remixes that stuck another load of bars into the middle and roller-pinned out the intro a bit. It was a thundering epic with rolling rhythms with nowhere to go but upwards: in retrospect, a shoegazing Higher State Of Consciousness.Rez got me trawling through the likes of Lemon Interupt and Junior Boys Own 12-inches. More importantly, I didn't hesitate in buying their next album Dubnobasswithmyheadman - despite it not containing Rez and instead having its addictive Karl Hyde-vocalled sequel Cowgirl.Underworld went on to score Danny Boyle films and frighten millions of people on TV. They also went on to produce two decades of brilliant music - and to write many lyrics of entertaining nonsense. But for me Rez would be the track that taught me boundaries were there to be broken in techno music, that it didn't just have to sound like sine waves jostling for position through MIDI connections. Techno could have soul. And you could record it in your back bedroom.No Rez would have meant no Cowgirl, no Dubnobass and no reference point for all those bands that hook into some extra kind of kinetic energy in their 4:4 rhythms.

I'd remember an old rave beat and hear within it the sound of later drum 'n' bass or electro.And then I noticed that most what I was remembering was from the same year. 1993.

With their cute little letters and dots and that?I have a constant paranoia that I tend to lean on certain words, especially writing about music. For example, I'm fond of blithering, such as a blithering vegetable here, blithering into a micromophone or me being a blithering hypocrite.And searching for 'fatroland' and 'crikes' may overload google to the point of exhaustion. Crikes.Many music writers do it. I've rarely seen the word 'sophomore' outside of rock-album-speak, while the NME's rendering of Northern swearing as 'fooking' is as prevalent as its Southern 'facking' counterpart is as absent.'Crepuscular' is normally reserved for animals that come out at dawn and dusk, such as the crepuscular nightjar. That link says the nightjar is a 'goatsucker' and spreads a disease called 'puckeridge'. Bands are not, generally speaking, goatsuckers, but they do tend to attract the adjective 'crepuscular'. Especially if it's the Guardian describing them.The Guardian has taken the word 'crepuscular' to new lengths in its music writing, as pointed out in this sweary tweet from my Electronic Sound collaborator Bill Bruce. It's a useful word, really, because 'crepuscular' relates to 'twilight' - but you can't say 'twilight' because people think of vampires.An early Grauniad music usage was Alexis Petridis' two crepusculars in a Blur live review and album review from 2003. But I think Caroline Sullivan pips him to the post with her short 2001 review of Copenhagen's Tales From the Forest (scroll down) where she called them the \"Tindersticks school of crepuscular pop\".How crepuscular is the Graun's music writing?

They meet Windows, a legendary dragon slayer, and his burger-obsessed friend Barry. As the movie progresses, the footage the filmers capture says more about them than it does about their subjects.I should declare an interest. I'm an extra in Wizard's Way and I'm mentioned in the credits. I know the production team that made it, so there is less chance of me saying anything negative about this film than Hugh Grant's hopes of getting the lead role in a Rupert Murdoch biopic. Still...If Wizard's Way doesn't end up rated as one of the funniest films of 2013, I'll eat my wizard's hat. There are so many highlights: Windows' hopeless looks to camera; Barry's earnest culinary exploits, the bickering of the film makers, and the terrible game itself. It's a masterclass in comedy editing: the low-budget production and entirely improvised dialogue is chopped to perfection. It helps that one of their editors also worked on Spaced, Slumdog Millionaire and Les Mis.The film is also full of heart, turning its social freaks into friends you really care about. And the theme tune. The theme tune. Couldn't stop singing it all weekend.Wizard's Way won the LOCO Discovery Award 2013, hence the screening, and is listed by LOCO's co-founder as one of the five comedy films to watch for in 2013.

A guaranteed post-Xmas X Factor chart-topper, some r'n'b guff and that's about it. A drum 'n' bass track tiptoed in at number 100 and it seems Bon Jovi got back in the top 40, but neither are worth tweeting home about.Iron Maiden famously topped the charts in 1991 with Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter, followed by the ridiculous sadistic monks Enigma. Made-up people often took the chance for a cheeky early-January number one, with Mr Blobby and Bob The Builder inexplicably retaining their top positions after Christmas because there was naff all else to buy.Cotton Eye Joe. Chocolate Salty Balls. Even Daniel Bedingfield's squeaky anthem Gotta Get Thru This. You cannot tell me that those tracks would have had the same chart-dominating impact without lower sales across the rest of the January charts, as great (or otherwise) as they were.This weekend may well see the return to the top of the charts by Eminem, 50 Cent and that kazoo-voiced triangle man from Maroon 5. If they were covering White Town's Your Woman, or Aphex Twin's We Are The Music Makers, I'd class it as a cheeky new year number one.They're not. And so it goes.Further Fats:  Fat Roland's number one album chart death rant (2010)"},
{"title": "If it goes bleep, it may or may not be EDM", "date": "Jan 16, 2013", "text": "Many things have changed since this blog first limped onto the internet: the rise of dubstep; the dominance of downloads; Basshunter.One of the most interesting changes for someone as geeky as me is the crossover into popular culture of the abbreviation \"EDM\", which stands for Electronic Dance Music.EDM was virtually unheard of before 2005, but the last two years has seen a resurgence in the phrase, driven, it seems, by a dramatic upsurge in US dance culture. Vice have a cracking article explaining rave culture to Americans, The writer looks across the Atlantic to the crazy Americans and their worship of Deadmau5 and Skrillex, and says of Europe:\"This is a continent that had Born Slippy soundtracking political campaigns and school runs alike. We have politicians who have taken pills and DJs who open youth centres. Us watching you get into ecstasy and dance music is how I imagine you probably feel when you see footage of line-dancing classes in Runcorn and hear TGI Fridays waiters \"YEE-HAW!\"-ing their way to lonely and inevitable suicide.\"Love it.Labels don't matter, and as soon as you discuss them, it's easy to enter a moronic YouTube clickfest that results in two people drawling \"gaaaaaay\" at each other until they each literally die of stupidity. Also, this blog attracts many Americans with superb taste in music.But I'm not convinced by \"EDM\" either. It stands for Electronic Dance Music. In the UK, we have a name for that. It's 'dance music'. I think that article says as much. We may also call it IDM (Intelligent Dance Music) or techno or electronica, and perhaps IDM suggests a certain lineage via early Warp Records, and perhaps EDM is more energetic and commercial... but if we poke it and it goes bleep, that's enough for us. Or, at least, it should be.Maybe I should rename this blog Fat Roland On Stuff And That.Then again, I shouldn't bother.

{"title": "Hugely Monetarily Volatile: the decline of HMV", "date": "Jan 14, 2013", "text": "While journalists across the UK rush to be the first with a 'His Master's Voice silenced' headline, let me share a few thoughts about HMV, who at the time of writing look set to call in the administrators.The news is tragic: a true end of an era for chain record shops. I work in a wonderful independent bookshop that knows a thing or two about retail the age of the internet. It is no surprise that HMV couldn't see out January: they launched a massive post-Christmas sale in an effort to avoid breaching banking covenants. It's all about cash flow and HMV were struggling.The Chief Executive Officer link with Jessops and Threshers will be raked through by the press and maybe suggests a management problem. But let's be honest. How many CDs did you buy a year from HMV?I still shopped at the Manchester HMV, although the last thing I bought was a while ago. Orbital's Wonky perhaps, because Piccadilly Records had sold out. I've been in since, but I'm not a gamer and I've limited need for the many accessories that adorn their once CD-rich racks. Money talks: if I'd wanted to HMV to survive, I would have spent more with them.We don't shop local any more, do we? I remember when shop-local campaigns burst out onto the high street, encouraging us to plough our pound coins into the local economy when we began to notice the desolation of the high street caused by major supermarkets. And yet those people who still buy from grocers and from butchers think nothing of ploughing their money into Amazon, me included. Shop local be damned.HMV will now be in the hands of administrators as they negotiate a future. The shops remain open for now, I believe. The chain sells over a third of all physical music and more than a quarter of all DVDs and Blu-Rays (dammit, modern world, we need a collective term for those formats). I worry about the impact on distributors and its effect on the wider industry. And I worry about Fopp: I hope the administrators see its value.Spare a thought for the staff, and spare a thought for what has been lost. HMV was once great. Have a look at these kitsch photos of an old HMV from the 1960s. Maybe now this is the age of the independents and we should all finger their racks at the earliest opportunity: the likes of Piccadilly Records are more relevant than ever.Meanwhile, old Woofy, or whatever the dog is called, sits staring into an abyss. It listens for its master's voice, but all it can hear is faint ZX Spectrum loading bleeps as an echo from the past translated as \"one day, HMV, these computers will find you and we will destroy you - it just may take thirty years. Hold on while the tape loads...\"Further Fats: His master has spoken (2007)"},
{"title": "Top ten best movies of 2012", "date": "Dec 31, 2012", "text": "Digested all the blog lists summing up 2012 in increasingly shrill tones? Time to click the internet away until 2013? You don't get away with it that easily. There is one final list I would like to shove in your face.These highlights of 2012 are incomplete because I'm not Mark bloody Kermode and I haven't got 92 hours a day to sit in a darkened room wondering how much better the movie would be in 2D. So I missed The Hobbit, Looper, The Raid, Argo, Holy Motors, Marley, Don't Think, Katy Perry's Part of Me and all those fancy films with subtitles.Still, I love the cinema. It's the one time when I can truly get away from my troubles / my past / the bailiffs / the police. Here are my top ten movies for 2012, peppered with other titles that didn't make it into the final running.10 - TedI wanted to dislike Ted. Talking teddies are in the same furry league as anamophic animals: all cutesie and moralistic. Leave it to Pixar to get that stuff right.However, it works wonderfully in the paws of Seth MacFarlane, who played writer, director and bear. It's not subtle (like I said, it's Seth MacFarlane), but it's deliciously funny even before you take into account Patrick Stewart's bitter narration.And if it gets a generation of plush toy-hugging kiddywinks into smoking crack, what's not to love?9 - SkyfallAfter an adequate cut-and-shut job in Quantum, Bond is back on form as a weakened Daniel Craig battles the mayhem of M's past. The central premise of Skyfall - a lost hard drive - is so believable, we can forgive all the action film tropes (deux-ex-machina, plot-serving support characters). It's great fun and has a solid Bourne feel about it.Sam Mendes has a clear affection for the franchise, and Bardem's baddie is psycho-Larry Grayson. Just let's not think about Adele's woeful rhyming couplets.IntermissionThere are two films from 2011 which I wanted to mention. I spent such a long time wanting to see Another Earth, it just seemd so magical and different. I sat down to watch it this year. I fell asleep. This is no comment on the quality of the film, and it just means that the little paragraph raving about it in my 2012 summary has turned into this: a grovelling apology. Sorry, Another Earth.I did, however, see Martin Scorsese's 2011 movie Hugo which truly was magical although not necessarily anything different. It does that Cinema Paradiso thing of romanticising the flicks to great effect. I'm a Scorsese sceptic (a 'Sceptsese') but Hugo hits home with every single beat. Didn't bother with 3D though. More about that later...8 - Room 237The Shining is a movie about a boy with a talking finger, right? Wrong. It's about the carpet. It's about Native Americans. It's about the moon landings.Five bonkers Shining fans waffle for the entire film about their insane theories about the hidden meanings of Kubrick's horror masterpiece. And it's brilliant.With more reveal moments than a Rihanna performance, Room 237 fizzles with celluloid geekiness as the theories unfold. Ultimately, though, it's a celebration of the human imagination - nutty or otherwise. Mostly nutty. Link7 - The MuppetsYes. The Muppets.Animal is in rehab. Gonzo is a plumber. Fozzie is in a crap Muppet's tribute band. If only they could get the gang back together for one last time... a bog-standard career revival story becomes a moving celebration in the fuzzy hands of Kermit and his pals.It's loaded with nostalgia, but the daftness is quite affecting and the Flight of the Conchords music (the white suit moment made me clap with glee) is worth the ticket price alone.Intermission: thoughts about PrometheusDie, die, die. I hope you all die. Oh look, you're walking over there. Oh look, now you're walking back again. There's a hostile alien environment. There's a weird gloop. There's a creature inside someone's torso. Someone's talking. They're still talking. Someone's got a mysterious map. If you join all the symbols on the map, it says I CARE ABOUT NONE OF YOU AND I HOPE YOU ALL GET EATEN BY THE ACTUAL ALIEN FROM ALIEN.6 - Seven PsychopathsI wrote about Seven Psychopaths on Screen 150, so go there. In short, Martin McDonagh's whimsical world is populated with Coen Brothers characters speaking Tarantino dialogue.It has the courage to get the McGuffin of a plot where a gangster persues his dog's kidnapper, put it to one side, and let the first-rate actors go town on the best script I've heard at the flicks this year.Just wait for the DVD to come out. I seriously think this film's IMDb quotes page will get very full. What? You think I'm not serious just because I carry a rabbit? Jeez.5 - The ArtistI'm not a film critic, so I don't have the luxury of advance screenings. So it goes that The Artist, which was released here in the UK on 30th December 2011, counts as a 2012 film. And what a film.It may not the first time we've seen a black and white tale of movie makers struggling in the transition to talkies, but The Artist's light touch brings us a perfect balance of drama and humour - as well as hugely effective use of its silence.It's worth seeing again without all the, er, noise generated by the critics a year ago.Intermission21 Jump Street is a stoopid buddy comedy about cops impersonating high school students to bust a drugs ring. The Woman In Black is about a grieving lawyer poking around a village terrorised by a ghost. One is funny and one is scary. One of them has someone being kicked in the goolies. One has someone stepping on a teacup. One has Channing Tatum. One has Harry Potter. Both have vomiting of some kind. Neither are in my top ten.4 - ChronicleIf Donnie Darko had true superpowers (and no, \"thinking of rabbits\" doesn't make you superhuman), then you'll probably get Chronicle. It has that free-wheeling freshness that made District 9 similarly entertaining.Careless teenages are afforded telekinetic abilities, forcing them to either grow up or stay as isolated teens forever. A science fiction story becomes a study of loneliness and anger.I wrote about this on Screen 150, but essentially it's a stupid premise handled with a fresh eye and an intelligent mind. The plot piles what-if upon what-if until we end up... well, that would be telling. \"Andreeeeew!\"3 - Cabin in the WoodsOh crumbs.Cabin In The Woods is a horror film, except it's not. It's about college kids in an isolated cabin, but it's not. It's about horrific blood-soaked deaths, but it's not.This film is unreviewable, so I'll keep it vague. AAAAARGH! AAAAAAARGH! AAAAAAAAAAARGH! WHO THE HELL IS THAT? WHAT IS HAPPENING? OH MY CRAPSIE! AAAARGH! Multiplied. A super-charged tour-de-force where the merest \"ding\" of a lift's arrival will give you the terrors for weeks afterward. Highly recommended.IntermissionUnlike many of my friends, I loved The Dark Knight Rises. Much of it doesn't make sense and I suspect the sheen will wear off with a second viewing, but I was in awe at Christopher Nolan's complete world-noir. I'm yet to see a better trilogy, so I was somewhat gutted to bump this from the top ten in favour of James Bond. The nagging plot holes probably sunk the Dark Knight this time.Meanwhile, The Master may be the darling of everyone's best-of list, but I couldn't shake its poor ending. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Joaquin Phoenix and Amy Adams build the tension terrifically, so believable is the madness in the methods of Hoffman's titular Master. But the movie went for what I can only describe as an 'I drink your milk' moment and it didn't work. Still a cause worth watching for, though.2 - Moonrise KingdomA boy goes missing and Edward Norton's slightly pathetic scoutmaster is on the case. Except, the boy is busy discovering being a grown-up with a weird girl carrying binoculars.Moonrise Kingdom is constructed from the strange storyboards and camera cues in Wes Anderson's mind, but unlike some of his previous films, it serves this beguiling and hilarious film brilliantly.Moonrise is a joy from start to finish. Hollywood stars (Willis! Swinton! McDormand! Bill blimming Murray!) play support to the child leads, themselves nailing the uncertainty of adolescence as the ominous clouds roll over the coast. It's eccentric, unsentimental and quite beautiful. This is Life Aquatic On The Shore.1 - Life of PiYoung Pi loses his parents to the sea and finds himself in literal choppy waters: uncertain fates await him as he battles to survive with only a vicious boy-eating tiger for company.Life Of Pi is an incredible achievement. Not only does it map out the dramas of the supposedly unfilmable book with remarkable clarity, the hyper-realistic CGI is unlike anything else I have seen. Anamorphic animals? This tiger's wrath is visceral throughout.You could argue it handles the novelistic metaphors a little ham-handedly (God, nature, all that stuff), but Life Of Pi is a near-perfect cinematic experience that had me gasping, looking away from the screen, laughing in delight and crying floods of tears. Ooo. Best not mention floods. Sorry, Pi.The man who brought us Crouching Hulk Hidden Mountain may have brought us his most amazing film yet. Well. Unless you watched it in stupid 3D.The 3D. Bah humbug. I don't want a pair of odd glasses to come between me and an immersing cinematic experience. Anything that takes your eyes a step away from the action is not a good thing. I saw Life Of Pi in 2D and, honestly, it's fine. It's amazing. It's my film of the year and is up there with Where The Wild Things Are. Anamorphic animals. Again."},

Stephen Hawking's Olympics follow-up where he sang the War of the Worlds soundtrack with Swedish House Mafia? Something the Mayans cooked up with a tub of LSD and a rack of 303s? Or is it something I'm about to spew out of my blog gob? I think you know the answer.Firstly, let's get stuck into a final selection of also-rans.[Read other parts of the top ten here: numbers 10-8; numbers 7-5; numbers 4-2. Click here for the whole lot.]Also-ransSome of this year's best electronic moments weren't in album form. Burial and Four Tet's haunting reunion for example. The Underworld and Orbital moments at the aforementioned Olympics. Anything Chvrches did.Back to the albums. I excluded Plug's Back On Time (Ninja Tune) from the running because it's an archive collection. Still love him though. Very much in the running was Gonjasufi's MU.ZZ.LE (Warp), which spent a lot of its time firmly lodged in my brainworm's little ears and would have been in the top ten if there hadn't been so much competition.Albums that didn't grab me so much but are still worth your time are Shed's powerful The Killer (50 Weapons), the sprightly disco of Lindstrøm's Smalhans (Feedelity) and the beautifully organic Voices From The Lake (Prologue) from Voices From The Lake.The lieTime for the number one album of 2012. Except it's not a number one. It's a joint number one. Two halves, if you will. This renders this entire top ten numerically nonsensical, but I tore my wig out with this year's choices and there isn't a single one of these 11 albums I can omit from this listing. Ten? Pah. Everything is a lie. This is the whole Bobby Ewing in the shower thing again. Stop reading, switch off your computer and get some fresh air.Still here? Okay then. Here are the number one albums of 2012. They're both Manchester artists. I assure you, this is a co-incidence... 1a - Andy Stott - Luxury Problems (Modern Love)If Andy Stott had a more interesting name, he’d be Thrumming Basslord Of The Universal Spheres or Mr Monged Out In The Corner Of Sankeys Soap Chewing Himself A New Ulcer. But no, he’s called Andy and he’s operated well under this reviewer’s radar with two albums on Modern Love and a couple of deep-as-hell dub techno EPs in 2011.It seems for this third album Luxury Problems (Modern Love), he stuck a microphone under the nose of his piano teacher – or possibly nicked her singing-into-hairbrushes tapes - and littered his record with sampled loops. Snippets of phrases are ever-present: always catchy, always heavenly, often rotating in mad gibberish.But then there's all the stuff lower down. Opening track Numb starts off all very nicely with her layered vocals, but when the track breaks down at the two minute mark into sinister voice cymbals followed by a bass drum with such gravity it would rip the sun from the clouds, this becomes something quite astonishing. Mid-tempo snares and industrial scrapes punch through much of the haze, but this is never far from a terrifying underground thunder (listen to the rising terror of Expecting). The power. The sheer power.It's a dub techno album that's more versatile than you think, from Lost and Found's angry rumbles and the pure sub bass of Hatch The Plan, to the comparatively brisk house of title track Luxury Problems and the junglism of Up The Box. Stott is in no rush and has the confidence to keep his ideas in check, only opening them up to the listener at exactly the right time. Luxury Problems is measured, like a movie with perfect pacing. The result is addictive.Like many of the best albums this year, it's not just techno. It's ambient, it's industrial, it's somehow reaching beyond the chalk lines that demarcate EDM/IDM sub-cultures. It's an immersing soundtrack that speaks of the stark Manchester mills and alleys in which this album was no-doubt made. Buy it. Stream it. Be awed and afraid. If you've got Luxury Problems, I feel good for you, son.1b - Lone - Galaxy Garden (R&S)Can I review Lone's Galaxy Garden (R&S) without using the much-trodden metaphors in other reviews of strange underwater worlds and video games, each one suggested by the music's contrasts of rich fluidity and punchy simplicity? The day-glo album cover itself suggests a hyper Mario submarine adventure full of bubbles, bleeps and electric octopuses.Lone is no stranger to this here blog. In 2009, I included Ecstacy and Friends in my albums of the year, rather bluntly calling it Goldie's Timeless without the d'n'b. In 2010, he missed out but still lured me with his lusciousness. And now, here he is at number one. Galaxy Garden is his first album for R&S, a classic Belgian techno label that has more recently become home to James Blake, Juan Atkins and Delphic, and it deserves to be listened to as a classic.Layers and layers of super magic sparkle dust are sprinkled across the silky smooth instrumentation on this album. Elastic rave chords and acid muzak are washed in filtered chords on The Animal Pattern, while the sweet and delicate Raindance delivers choppy techno and soaking wet snares. There are waterfalls, steel drums and tabla. It couldn't be more lush if you lay naked in the dew grass in a shower of bubbles. Wait. That sounds weird. Let's move on.Beyond the futuristic fat pads and multi-coloured vibrancy of Galaxy Garden, we also have an album of old influences. Lone has mainlined not only into the glassy hyper-charged world of Rustie, perhaps its most immediate modern comparison, but in places there is Underworld, Kevin Saunderson, early Warp and Tresor. Most notably, the gorgeous glow of tracks New Colour and Dream Girl/Sky Surfer stands as a tribute to the kings of smooth, 808 State. In-your-face gorgeous.I had this album on 'random' recently. There was a moment as Cthulhu faded away - the fifth track on the album but late on in my listening - where I took off my headphones, pulled out a chair from the corner of the room and let the memory of the tracks echo around my head. It sounded like I was listening to my own past. All the techno I had ever loved was here. That, my friends, is some endorsement.[Read other parts of the top ten here: numbers 10-8; numbers 7-5; numbers 4-2.

{"title": "Best electronica albums of 2012: numbers 4 to 2", "date": "Dec 29, 2012", "text": "We're into the top five of what I believe are the best electronic music albums of 2012. I've wet myself with excitement so many times, I'm having to sit on four layers of towels surrounded by a makeshift wall of mop-heads.We're into to rock-solid (or should that be bleep-solid) classic territory here. If numbers four to two are this good, my chart-topper is liable to trigger a flood alert.Inevitably, lots of artists didn't make the top ten. Here are some more also-rans for this year's chart.[Read other parts of the top ten here: numbers 10-8; numbers 7-5; number 1. Click here for the whole lot.]Also-ransBrian Eno's Lux (Warp) missed out on the top ten, as did another big-hitter, Clark. His Iradelphic (Warp) seemed to be Clark-by-numbers to me despite some spine-tingling moments and despite topping my chart three years ago. Shame.The DJ in me enjoyed I:Cube's mixtape-tastic “M” Megamix (Versatile) and Stunt Rhythms (Big Dada) from my favourite Amon Tobin guise Two Fingers. Also missing out is the noisy improvisation of Carter Tutti Void's Transverse (Mute), an utterly replayable IDM album Steam Days (Border Community) from Nathan Fake and two records from Mouse On Mars: comeback LP Parastrophics (Monkeytown) and follow-up mini-album WOW (Monkeytown).4 - Grimes - Visions (4AD)Grimes. Of course, Grimes. I played with the idea of excluding her because she might be too ‘pop’ for the EDM/IDM subculture this blog appeals to. Then I decided only an flipping idiot would exclude her, and although I am an idiot, I’m not a flipping idiot. Because, if you didn’t already know, Visions (4AD) is one of the best albums of the year in any genre.Among the hazy layered vocals, analogue synth hooks and the light touch that keeps everything in a perfect balance, you’ll find Grimes reclaiming the orchestral stab (Oblivion), bringing back 1980s Prince beats (Colour Of Moonlight) and making a good job of a Mariah wail (Be a Body).Ah yes. The voice, the voice, the voice. This will make or break the album for you. She’s high, she’s low, she’s delicate and she’s bluesy – almost choral on tracks like Skin. The voice is everywhere, and at its most effective, it is versatile and moving. Tied with such solid instrumentation, if this doesn’t grab you on first play, try it a dozen more times. Deserves to be on as many coffee tables as Moby (ask your grandad).3 - Actress - R.I.P (Honest Jon’s)Two years after I excluded Actress’ Splazsh from my end-of-year top ten, here he is making waves in the 2012 list. And what an unexpected treat: Actress has shut his drum machine under the stairs with the hoover, instead producing a collection of loops that take their rhythm from the likes of tape hiss, broken orchestration and eerie rattles. And probably from the hoover too.R.I.P (Honest Jon's) is a dirty affair, but he allows space for the crackles and nastiness by keeping it simple. Actress has dug down into the essence of each track, finding the trashy distortions and frequencies then ditching anything else that doesn’t fit the groove. It’s puffy, fuzzy but not fussy.Tracks like Raven are so smothered in hiss, it takes a while to find the rhythm. Somewhere amid the hissing loops of Marble Plexus, I hear a bass drum: I almost write a letter of astonishment to the Telegraph. Serpent has a shaky Splazsh-style rhythm but it’s bedded beneath layers of strings – in the true orchestral sense – and is the best example of why there's no other album like this in 2012. R.I.P is deep, metallic and, erm, dead good.2 - Orbital - Wonky (ACP)You wait eight years for a new Orbital album and one comes along at once. It is an unwritten rule of music criticism that comebacks should not work. Chinese Democracy. Free As A Bird. Dark Light*. They often give you the feeling you've been cheated. And yet Wonky (ACP) was Orbital’s best album since the mid-90s, leaving sweating fans everywhere throwing deep shapes of relief.The throw-back moments are here, for example the Satan remix or the Belfast-style old tape loop reused for Stringy Acid, or indeed in the cut-up vocals starting One Big Moment or the skipping Distractions snares. But Orbital don't rely on these production details: instead they choose to rack up their live punch front-and-centre. New France is stadium dance music at its most euphoric, while title track Wonky is all build-up and build-up designed to wear out the soles of your disco crocs.The two 2012 gig tickets in my pocket prove I am an Orbital junkie, so maybe I shouldn’t be placing them so high up in this top ten. But comeback albums of this quality are rare, and to top that, this album has a live anthem with as much potency as Chime and as much catchiness as Impact: album closer Where Is It Going equals their absolute best. They couldn't have done this better - and if you need one more reason for the Satan-bringers appearance in this top ten, this just so happens to be my 666th blog post on Fat Roland on Electronica.

Dozens of discs were whittled into a select ten that your reel-to-reel mp3 player should not be without.Before we get stuck into the middle bit of the top ten, here are some albums that didn't make it through.[Read other parts of the top ten here: numbers 10-8; numbers 4-2; number 1. Click here for the whole lot.]Some also-ransIt pained me to exclude two amazing albums from this top ten. The first was Leila's between-the-eyes electro on U&I (Warp), much of it worth checking out by Orbital fans, while Lukid's Lonely At The Top (Werkdiscs) is my number 11 in a list of 10.I reviewed several albums for Electronic's debut magazine, and the one that sticks in my head is Sterac's smooth remaster of Secret Life of Machines (100% Pure) and Last Step's deliberately dream-driven Sleep (Planet Mu) in which Venetian Snares does accessible.Thomas Datt's punchy trance album Picking Up The Pieces (Discover) was likeable,The Gaslamp Killer's Breakthrough (Brainfeeder) wasn't quite the breakthrough I was hoping for but still had a smoky charm.I need to mention Dave Monolith's Welcome (Rephlex) which I listened to too late for last year's countdown (it was first mentioned here and yes, it's a masterpiece), while finally I've never quite tuned into the critically-lauded Shackleton's wavelength (Music For the Quiet Hour (Woe To The Sceptic Heart)).7 - Squarepusher – Ufabulum (Warp)A welcome return to form from the brother of Ceephax Acid Crew. Ufabulum (Warp) may not forge new territory, but it brims with trademark chords, clipped snares and bonkers digitalism reminiscent of Go Plastic. The d’Demonstrator funk is reigned in as is the live bass, and this, uh, albulum is stronger for it. (That's now a word.)Opening track 4001 is a hymn to hands-in-the-air IDM, a sound more evident in the first half of the long-player with much of the deformed compression saved for later in the record. In fact, his light touch is faintly comical, such as the computer game bleeps of Unreal Square, the Plone-style tunefulness of Stadium Ice and the punchy power chord theme-tune of Energy Wizard.By the time we get to closer Ecstatic Shock, the melody is suffocated by farting bass and stop-start beats: it reminds us the machines are truly in control and we are a long way from the Squarepusher as the saviour of live electronics. Maybe he could have pushed more boundaries, but this is his best album since Ultravisitor and, whisper it, a bit of a relief.6 - Vessel - Order of Noise (Tri Angle) Vessel seems to have come from nowhere – well, actually, Bristol – to produce one of the surprise highlights of 2012. Not really techno, not really house, not really anything, he signed to the influential Tri Angle label to become labelmates of Balam Acab and oOoOO for his debut album.The strength of Order of Noise (Tri Angle) is its understatement. Lache, for example, shuffles along nicely, while the slow breaths of Silten are quite lovely. But then Vessel will grab some Global Communication-style tones or Leftfield warmth from somewhere, or perhaps a simple drum fill, a suspended chord or a sub-bassline, and suddenly the simple motifs become something quite affecting.Villane sounds like Thom Yorke in his death-throes, while I love the whooping halfstep dub of Images of Bodies. The chugging Court Of Lions is a highlight, all tick-tock disco and wafer thin ambience topped off with a late-in-the-day four-line refrain. Vessel commented on this site in 2008 that he was \"trying his ass off\". Taken as a whole, Order of Noise is such a complete vision and a triumph of ideas, it can be considered as one of the most effective debuts of recent times.5 - Flying Lotus - Until The Quiet Comes (Warp)Describing the new Flying Lotus album is a bit like trying to describe the weather: we all seem to know what it looks like, what it feels like, and there are plenty of places on the internet where you can get much more information than from anything I can jab into my worn Logitech keyboard. Although I'm not sure Elijah Wood appeared in a weird amputee fantasy video to warn us about an approaching cold front (Tiny Tortures).There was a danger with Until The Quiet Comes (Warp) that FlyLo would begin to believe his astral zodiac cosmogrammic shizzle and become as nakedly overrated as the proverbial emperor’s clothes. Think how UNKLE went. Instead, he has taken a small step away from the free jazz claustrophobia of his last work and produced a beautiful odyssey that is easier on the ears but no less fascinating.The jazz is back as are the guest vocalists (See Thru To U), but the album really shines in the stranger corners: the playground insanity of Putty Boy Strutt, that beguiling “oh no” refrain of All The Secrets, and the African influences throughout, especially on the steel drums of Yesterday//Corded. Strange, thoughtful and delicate, and great for all weathers.[Read other parts of the top ten here: numbers 10-8; numbers 4-2; number 1. Click here for the whole lot.]Further Fats: Best electronica albums of 2010."},
{"title": "Best electronica albums of 2012: numbers 10 to 8", "date": "Dec 27, 2012", "text": "It's time for my annual rake through the detritus of the last 12 months: my top ten list of the best electronic music albums of 2012.I don't know if it's the seventeen recessions we've been through, but this year's list feels quite different from the previous ones. Instead of the summer-tinged likes of Mount Kimbie or the chirpiness of Plaid, these selections seem more dour. A bit miserable. So something to look forward to, then.Still, this represents what I am convinced is the best of the best. Let's start with some runners that didn't quite make it to the final fence.[Read other parts of the top ten here: numbers 7-5; numbers 4-2; number 1. Click here for the whole lot.]Some also-ransFour Tet sellotaped together some 12-inch singles to produce an album called Pink (Text), but it was too much like Mr Tet in workman mode for my liking. Despite the appearance of the godlike Jamie Lidell, and brilliant though it was, Simian Mobile Disco's Unpatterns (Witchita Recordings) didn't make it to the final list.The psychedelic experimentalism of Juju & Jordash's Techno Primitivism (Dekmantel) was quite something to behold. Two acts turned my head this year but didn't produce albums. Still, it's worth checking out oOoOO's heroin-tinged beats on Our Loving Is Hurting Us (Tri Angle) and do grab the massively important collaboration of Hudson Mohawke and Lunice in the shape of the eponymous TNGHT (Warp x LuckyMe) EP.The oldies were still at it. Underworld refreshed an old compilation to release the 1992-2012 Anthology (Underworldlive.com), which by default was full of brilliance, while less successfulwas DJ Food's first album in over a decade: The Search Engine (Ninja Tune) was swamped with guest vocals and not much else.10 - Ital - Hive Mind (Planet Mu)Here we have a Thrill Jockey lad (watch Mi Ami’s Dolphins: yeah, that’s him in the gloves) who has left indie-crossover to inhabit a crystalline landscape of mid-paced house grooves and perfectly-pitched ambience that should, on first listen, pitch-bend its quirky way into your brainhole and stay there for some time.Ignore the Whitney Houston sample – that’s entertaining enough – but instead listen in awe at Hive Mind (Planet Mu)'s Israel where warm washes shoot into curious new territory at the two-thirds mark, or the moody stomp of Floridian Void that gives in to heart-breaking synth washes, or the disorientating brokenness of Privacy Settings.There are only five tracks – three of them are ten minutes long – so if you don’t want the opening phrase of Lady Gaga’s Born This Way over Footwork-ish wrong-key disco edited in some pretty basic software (Audacity, I believe), then maybe you should peruse the rest of this top ten instead. But for me, this was Planet Mu’s shining moment of 2012.9 - Silent Servant - Negative Fascination (Hospital Productions)“Stasis is death. See you on the other side.” These were the final words of industrial techno label Sandwell District at the start of this year. For one of their artists, the other side happened to include a mesmerising album called Negative Fascination (Hospital Productions), produced amid economic flux as Hospital found themselves closing their lovely blood-red record shop in Manhattan.Silent Servant offers desolate dark techno with leanings towards post-punk minimalism. It could be just another Basic Channel-soundalike, but in this world there is enchanting magic: the beautiful persistence of Temptation & Desire, the deep suspended disco of Utopian Disaster (End) and the metallic clunk (no, it’s better than it sounds, honest) of Invocation Of Lust. This servant is lonely but alluring.Even the unforgiving android barks of The Strange Attractor, which would leave most diving for cover, offer a strange allure that gives these gaunt, DIY rhythms the space and depth to let the imagination wander. Rarely in 2012 has an album given me so little on first listen then slowly hooked its rusty claws under my skin.8 - Monolake - Ghosts (Imbalance)If the rasping snares of the opening title track haven’t ripped off your leg before the two minute mark of Monolake’s seventh album Ghosts (Imbalance), and the whispering industrial voices haven't sucked your weak heart from your chest, then you’ll probably survive the rest of this cold, cold, cold album.The creaks and drips of Taku feels like you’re tiptoeing through an underground cave only to realise you’re inside a stomach, while the clinking Unstable Matter is pure horror film soundtrack. The slamming urgency of Foreign Object, cloaked as the sound of a distant choir trying to pickaxe their way out of a landslide, is so full of industrial swag, it would be best to take up the foetal position until the memory subsides.Monolake debuts in one of my top tens because this time there is more of a solid rhythmic structure, and although it’s all rather disembodied, it gives me more to hook onto than other ‘lake offerings. A good starter for new Monolake listeners, perhaps. Insert journalistic ‘I believe in Ghosts’ ending here.[Read other parts of the top ten here: numbers 7-5; numbers 4-2; number 1. Click here for the whole lot.]Further Fats: Best electronica albums of 2009."},
{"title": "Top ten ways to write a top ten music list", "date": "Dec 25, 2012", "text": "The first ever list was a load of commandments chiselled into stone and carried across the Red Sea by Moses (or something) and now in commemoration of that event, we have a season called yuletide in which everyone makes end-of-year lists.You may think end-of-year lists just appear, as if it's blatantly obvious that Alt-J are more worthy than Jesse J. But these finely-tuned summaries of arbritary time periods are borne of much chin-stroking, scalp-scratching and cat-squeezing.I am compiling my usual legendary run-down of electronic albums of 2012, due for publication before the new year. If you too are compiling a list, I can help. Here are my top ten ways to write a top ten music list.Pay attention.1. Um... er... I think that, er... um...2. Be decisive. Grab your reader with your first choice. Work out what will appear first when people click onto your list, whether counting down or counting up. A list gives you a certain authority. And sound confident by not repeating yourself. Be decisive.4. Don't miss numbers just to make your list appear shorter. This is like those newsagents that don't give a penny change so they can donate to a jar in their storeroom labelled 'foot spa fund'. It's all a bit of a con and, quite frankly, their feet will always stink no matter what they do.5. Ensure one of your choices is something you hate but you saw a 400-word gushfest about it in a broadsheet once even though the journalist was probably sexing the bassist in a bath of Ben and Jerry's at the time. Make it your number two choice, thereby showing a sneering nod to the critic fashionistas.6. Go to the riverside. Take a net. Hide in the bushes until you see a lesser-spotted adjective. Quick, grab it. Scoop up that little blighter. Gather more, add some great-breasted adverbs, lasso a superlative or five. Let your descriptions ring out as they flap and wheeze for air on the page. Then delete them and just compare everything to shoegaze or Skrillex instead.7. Include a friend's band in the lower reaches of your chart. You go to their gigs to be polite, you know Nick Grimshaw will never play them, and the reason why you bought three of their self-copied album is because of basic maths: one for each dart.B. Don't feel tied to a numerical system. Count in letters. Count in Greek letters. Count in the Mayan alphabet, which incidentally finishes at 7 at which point newspapers across their country donate all their column inches to pictures of slightly worried dogs beneath stormy skies accompanied by the heading 'ADOGALYPSE'.9. Include one of your regular favourites whose material has deteriorated so badly over the years that you find yourself at their gigs surrounded only by fatter and more shell-suited versions of you. Include them because failing to do so would invalidate an important part of your identity. Include them in your list. Eat pies. Buy a shell suit.10. Don't do an end-of-year list. Only an idiot short of imagination and long of time would resort to compressing a year's worth of other people's creativity into a meaningless chart which has neither the exposure nor the financial backing to make it any more relevant than a moth's cough. A worse offence would be to do a list about making the list: that alone is heinous with the emphasis on 'anus'. Anyone who barely even thinks of a number in a blog post, never mind include them should have the following things confiscated: their blogging account, the internet, their hands, ability to formulate thoughts, trousers.The Fat Roland top ten electronic albums run-down will be published from December 27th.

Oh look, here's Buster dragging his bum across the baby's face, how cute. Eeeugh. And no, I don't want to say hello to your dog when I meet you neck-deep in the brown stuff on a poo-strewn pavement.There should be a dog licence which includes training for owners in pack mentalities and dog behaviour. Most of my dog bites - and I've had a few, believe me - have been from mutts that \"wouldn't bite\". Of course they bite, you silly owner, it's what they do.You're waiting for the punchline, aren't you? You're waiting for the moment I spin this around and say I meant clogs and sorry for the typo.There's no punchline. There are two exceptions, though.Firstly, The Black Dog (pictured) are quite unvile and lovely. Their influential early albums showed me that dance music could be emotive and intelligent: Temple of Transparent Balls and Bytes were a deep and involving antidote to the two-dimension dance smash of the same year, No Limit by 2 Unlimited.What's great is they're still making amazing music. The Black Dog are a good dog. Here, have a bone.Secondly, my next-door neighbour's dog Wilf loves me. Even if I am miles off, he goes insane at the sight of me. His tail tells me in impatient semaphore that I am the best thing that has happened to his day. He only does this with me and one other neighbour. He doesn't even show the same level of shuddering, dribbling uber-joy for his actual owners, the duplicitous wee beastie. Wilf is great.Wilf and The Black Dog are exempt.

{"title": "Rihanna has ruined everything", "date": "Oct 11, 2012", "text": "Rihanna's latest single is the death of creativity.That's it. It's over. Unplug your guitar. Put down your paintbrush. Leave that ice sculpture for the sun. Rihanna has ruined everything.It's bad enough that the X Factor bursts with so many brands (the contestants' phones, Syco, the hotel they stay in, more Syco, even the cups on the desk in the US version) that there's barely space for the soundwaves what with all that money flying about.But now Rihanna has released an advert and it's got to number one. An advert.I'm not naive. I'm used to Levi jeans once belting up the the charts and Mr Latest Bling Bling Hippety-hop getting jiggy with cars and expensive fizz, but the Rihanna thing is quite unbelievable. Let me explain.A few years ago, Emporio Armani launched a fragrance called Diamonds. Cue a launch party with Beyonce, Josh Hartnett getting his nips out in black and white commercials. and a forthcoming tie-in with MTV.Diamonds is, according to its maker's website, \"inspired by both the past and the present, the traditional and the modern\". Such unique selling points are \"particularly reflected by the ingredients\". Better the actual 'ingredients' than, say, the bottle coming with a buffalo that constantly points at a watch as it screams \"don't think about the future, NEVER THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE\" in Buffalese.Meanwhile, in another corner of the empire, Rihanna designs things for Armani: bags, pants, jeans, that kind of thing. It's an odd profession for someone who wears so little of anything, but she will earn a universeful of cash as did her preceding shill Posh Spice.Nothing new, just people doing stuff.So I can only imagine the writing process with Rihanna's latest single (no, I'm not calling her RiRi: she's not a panda), because she really has jumped the shark, punched the buffalo and bashed the bishop on this one.RIHANNA: Shine bright like a... Shine bright like a... like a... I'm really struggling with a simile to finish this chorus.PRODUCER: Star? Sun? Giorgio Armani's tanned face?THE LIGHTS FLICKER. THE ROOM GETS COLD. ARMANI FLOATS INTO THE ROOM.ARMANI: Someone mention my name?RIHANNA: Georgie boy, we're struggling to finish--ARMANI: Get a load of this.ARMANI SPRAYS THE DIAMONDS FRAGRANCE INTO RIHANNA'S FACE. HER EYES GLAZE OVER. MEANWHILE, THE PRODUCER RUNS SCREAMING FROM THE BUILDING. HE RETIRES FROM WORKING IN STUDIOS, ALTHOUGH IN 2019 IS SPOTTED IN AN EARLY X FACTOR AUDITION DRESSED AS A BAD LEO SAYER.\"Shine bright like a diamond\" it is. And that, dear reader, is how Rihanna's new single Diamonds came to be named after her employer's fragrance Diamonds, with both snuggled so close on this screenshot on the Official Charts Page (below), they could mate and give birth to, um, a parallelogram.Well done, Rihanna. More than anyone in the history of the charts, you've reduced the number one spot to a commercial.

And then I get distracted by the Labour party conference and the resolutions flutter into my recycling bin.I like to think of Labour as my natural party of choice. I was born in the great industrial city of Manchester, and my childhood memories include the smell of bike oil and dad coming back from t'pit at t'weekends. Okay, I liked about t'pit and t'weekends. But I was into T'Pau for a bit.Actually, I haven't voted for Labour in a general election for 20 years. Tony Blair put me off: too blue. I felt he sent old Labour drifting down the river like Phil Silvers in It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World with Tony Benn as the solitary floating hat reminding us of a once great party.Still, that didn't stop me spending half of this week at their conference venue setting up a bookshop. And because it can be hard work and because a lot of people I meet might be quite bonkers, and because the set-up has done my back in a bit and I'm in a bad mood, you're going to get the brunt of my Labour conference experience in the shape of a few roughly-honed blog posts.Let's start gently because it's early days. Here are some photos from set-up, Watch this blog for more updates in the coming days when things, y'know, actually get interesting.1. We all get little stands like this. Our bookshop, which you'll see in later blog posts, takes up several of these little stands.2. There is a stand called Everything Everywhere. There was nothing in it when I took this photo. Perhaps it's irony. Do politicians do irony?3. Some nice person had left a bit of paper on their stall. It says SMILE. I wonder if it's the bank. Or maybe it's a dentist thing and they're going to fashion their stand into a gaping, toothless mouth for children to play in, complete with real saliva.4. The RNIB wheeled in their Eye Pod on Wednesday. There are two eyes, not quite aligned. I think the inside will be full of massive eyeballs - like a ballpit, only horrible.5. This is a camera. On the other side of this wall is the room in which all the speeches are made. There tend to be camera people lurking, hoping for that crucial shot of Ed Balls belly dancing or of John Prescott mainlining pork pie jelly.6. Sky News are here. Last time I saw their conference stand, it had Boris Johnson in it. Not at the Labour conference, I hasten to add.7. I think these are hats.8. This is the main speeches room under construction. The big, dark rectangle is a video screen on which they will display a permanently rotating head of Neil Kinnock as he rabbits on about the soil in his garden and how his Ocado delivery was late this week.9. A messy set-up for the union chaps. They do have more red paint than any other colour.10. \"Perspex Labour Party G-Mex.\" This was a piece of wood raised to head height with no perspex in sight. I think it's a puzzle to be solved, like the Da Vinci Code.11. Marks and Spencer have built an entire shop in the middle of the venue. This is a man pointing at a light and saying it's a light and his friends are saying yes it's a light, we can all agree on that.Further Fats: In the belly of the beast - a week in Tory politics"},

Because of a bourbon biscuit addiction during a cold turkey phase in the 90s, she let herself go a bit. A lot. But sometimes, the gasping and the wheezing sounds a bit like DJ scratching, so it's okay.Django DjangoFollowing the critical acclaim of several shows in the West End written by monkeys with typewriters, hopes were high for the debut album by Django Django (pictured). Despite being a panda in Edinburgh Zoo, Django Django produced a truly human album, full of emotion and hope. Could have done without the twenty-minute bamboo drum solo, though.The MaccabeesForced circumcisions! The destruction of pagan altars! The murder of powerful Seleucid figures! These musical founders of the Judean Hasmonean dynasty may not be a cheerful bunch, but their barbershop quartet packs a punch.

I've not had a telly for ages. You're watching it and I'm not. I've no idea.

It was the Proclaimers again. Charlie and the other one that looks like Charlie got really Scottish with their guitars. I accidentally stayed for the whole gig, rooted to the spot by an overwhelming sense of nostalgia and whimsy. I could see myself two decades ago; I wondered if time had become a loop.This blog post is not a review of the Twin Godfathers of Del Amitri Pop Jangling. It's a reflection on Greenbelt, a festival which is as much a part of my DNA as that probe suppository those aliens gave me last time I saw Squarepusher.If you need a bit of context, you can read about Greenbelt in other blog posts, such as the time I went to some toilets, or when I spoke a man, or when I went into a tent for a bit. Oh, the stories I'll be telling my grandchildren.Greenbelt is a Christian arts festival with lashings of liberalism. This year, they had Robin Ince, Speech Debelle, Nitin Sawhney, Frank Skinner, Asian Dub Foundation and Peter Tatchell. There is plenty of churchy stuff too if you like that kind of thing. There is music, there is art, there are tea tents, and I've attended almost every one since 1992. Loads of attendees have been to many more than that.The festival tends to attract music artists on career-slides, although they were quick to get the likes of U2 and Moby before they went stratospheric. Neither is it big on electronic music, although I heard some filthy dubstep on one of the three music stages on Monday.Greenbelt also causes consternation among anti-gay and anti-Palestine campaigners. A devotee of a more evangelical festival once warned me that Greenbelt was full of \"gays and witches\". He was wrong about the witches.But it's there's more to Greenbelt than the content or its supposed political stance or its boundary-poking.Greenbelt is where I live; it's where I centre myself.It's a place of discovery: my talents, my sexuality, my careers, new friends. There are certain folk I only ever meet in Greenbelt's real ale tent (called The Jesus Arms), and when I see them it's like arriving home, opening the door and seeing family. Even though I only speak to them once a year. It's seems illogical and it's hard to explain.Greenbelt matters because it gives me roots in a world of judgementalism and homophobia, in a world where people use religion to enforce their own power and prejudices. It makes me feel valued and to want to be a better me. I also get to do fun things like run events with Sanctus 1.Next year, Greenbelt celebrates its 40th festival. I will have been to half of them (and will be celebrating 40 years of me too). Just writing this blog post finds me rooted to the spot by a sense of nostalgia and whimsy, as I was in that muddy Proclaimers field as I mentally battled their damn infectious melodies. I'm a techno-head... must break away... a-hah, a-hah... gaaaaah, stop it.... Yeah, I know, I'm not proud.I do need to stop. I have to make the 130-or-so mile journey back to Manchester shortly. Not 500 miles. Just 130.Meanwhile, I'll be processing my amazing few days at Greenbelt 2012 as I wash the mud from my clothes.

It all seems a blur, but I do remember being hoisted through the city streets on palm leaves, feathers and heavy-duty scaffolding. The sash matched my varicose veins.In December, I trapped all of Manchester's police in the sewers and injected explosives into all the concrete. I then imploded our American football stadium before making a man in a bat costume climb up a bit of a wall.The other week, I gave up my Fat Roland moniker and became Thin Malcolm for a day.

Good times, good times.Birthdays are about presents, so here are two things. Firstly, a Hounds Of Hulme track I recorded today (see below). It's a bit rough-and-ready, relying too much on preset instruments, but I like it. The energy from the track largely rose from watching the awful Olympic closing ceremony on iPlayer.

{"title": "Mmm Underworld, the world loves you", "date": "Jul 31, 2012", "text": "The Olympic opening ceremony bandwagon has not only bolted, it has sprouted jet engines and shot off to the dark side of the moon. But I have to talk about it for one reason and one reason alone. Lemon Interupt.This was a little-known house music act that shared a label with Terry Farley and Ashley Beedle in the early 1990s. The playful repeating harmonica on Big Mouth was a style later appropriated by the likes of The Grid and, yeesh, the Rednex.More importantly, they were better known as Underworld, whose music lent so much energy to the rising chimneys and flaming flutes of Friday night's telly.Underworld expressed the 90's fractured postmodernism better than Zoo TV or grunge, with Edward Lear-style blethering spilling out of their music and, through Tomato, their design aesthetic.Their third album dubnobasswithmyheadman gave us the bold epics Mmm Skyscraper I Love You, with its visions of Elvis, fat Jesus and whipped cream, and Dark & Long which you heard in the opening ceremony. Yes, I said third album. Their first two were synth pop efforts for Sire and are for purists only.By the time they were shouting \"lager, lager\" - actually not one of their strongest tracks - many dance-heads could claim Underworld as part of their musical DNA. As part of their emotional DNA. We had the MTV-baiting slo-mo of Push Upstairs, their immense anthem Rez, and soundtracks for Anthony Minghella, Danny Boyle and the Royal National Theatre.Given all this history, when I tuned into BBC iPlayer with \"I AM CYNICAL\" already written in vinegar on my computer screen, I wasn't quite expecting the Underworld feast that followed. Always Loved A Film, Moon In Water, Dirty Epic, Crocodile... even their immense pieces And I Will Kiss and Caliban's Dream nicked bits from other Underworld tracks. That lead to the flame being lit with a synth line ripped from Two Months Off.It was unbelievable. Let's say your favourite food is toast, but no-one else knows about toast so it feels like your little secret. You know that by applying heat to bread, it goes brown and crunchy, but you want everyone else just to carry on enjoying their floppy, disappointing room-temperature Tesco's finest loaves. Then after 20 years of loving toast and secretly meeting other people that like toast, the moon has suddenly become a grill and every building on earth has been replaced by a perfectly smoking slice of Hovis. The population is amazed as they dance through the streets with giant butter knives shouting \"toast! toast! toast! we like it the most! most! most!\". Children skip through fountains of crispy crumbs before scuttling off to dark alleyways to sniff marmalade. Toast is the thing. Uneaten sandwiches spill out of overflowing bins, landfill sites double in height with slices of gravy-soaked bread, and although the white / brown / wholemeal / Mighty White war breaks out in the Middle East, the future is toast. The world is enjoying your little secret.I agree that the Olympic opening ceremony was a worthless diatribe of propaganda for evil things like the NHS, multiculturalism, pop music, lesbians, industry, sheep and people dancing in top hats. How can we not hate all of those things? But everyone who watched it got a lesson in Underworld. And, for that matter, their collaborator High Contrast.In 40 years time, one of the surviving members of Underworld, all wrinkles and no reputation, will be dragged on stage at royal jubilees and sports ceremonies to perform out-of-tune versions of fading classics. While the other one narrates Thomas the Tank Engine. Meanwhile, I dedicate this 650th blog post to one of my favourite bands come good. 650 is the rate at which Underworld resonate.

I am Damien Hirst's bling skull. I am Damien Hirst's Last Supper (he may not have done that one).There's a thing called 3Hundredand65 where an illustrated story is told in a year's worth of tweets. We all get to do a day: in my case, I tweeted fifty days in where I stripped the protagonist of his clothes and covered him in tea. No doubt the 364 other authors may take the story in a different direction.And what authors. My comrades-in-365dom include Chris Addison, Ian Rankin, Stephen Fry, Bill Bailey, Irvine Welsh, Jonathan Ross, Neil Gaiman, Tim Burgess, Clint Boon, and many many more. Oh and plenty of unknowns like me too.I found it a strange experience because I'm very picky about my writing and who I work with. So for example, in my tweet I killed off a whirlwind that was annoying me only to have a whirlwind return in today's tweet. And you find yourself compromising with other people's writing styles... well, not compromising... collaborating.Having your tweet turned into an illustration by the immensely talented Dave Kirkwood (an abstract of which is included in the above picture) is another level of powerlessness you get with true collaboration. Sometimes that leads to tweeters trying to lead the illustrator on with their tweets - as I did. 'I'd like this, this and this in my illustration, please!'. This whole project is fun, liberating and surprising.If all that wasn't enough, you can now find me on 'Collaborate', a limited edition print featuring all the authors from the first three months of the project.

Let's explore Wonky track by track.Track one: One Big Moment teases you with looping voice samples of Duck Feet-era whimsy before hitting you, at precisely 70 seconds, between your techno nostrils and declaring Wonky as the best Orbital album for yonkers.The processed mayhem is a delightful statement of intent so early on.Track two: The scuzzy LFOs of Straight Sun mix Snivilisation wafer-thin monophonic synth lines with more plodding, stomping Blue Orbital, and it's no less pleasing for any of that.Tracks three and four: The slow builder Never makes a feature of those trademark half-bar bridges that litters their music, while the proggy New France seems to be Zola Jesus filtering Rihanna's \"ay ay\" vocal cut with an intense synth rock sweat-in. Both work with limited ideas to great effect.Track five: Distractions is the least immediate track here, a pastoral meander perhaps, although the furious drums suggests a possible live favourite at work.Track six: I'm not sure if Belfast has Beaches, but Stringy Acid mixes two very different Orbital periods whilst apparently intending to emulate the sound of seagulls being shot. It's the one full-on floor filler on this album.Track seven: The Hartnoll brothers attempting dubstep on the multiple-personality Beelzedub (a remake of Satan) is a bit like your dad wandering into a club and breakdancing, body-popping and footstepping the rest of the dancefloor into a week next Tuesday. It's a bit all over the place, but still, y'know, better than 99% of all dubstep tracks.Track eight: Title piece Wonky has Lady Leshurr busting rhymes whilst she plays Whac-a-Mole with cats. Its toe-dip into new territory reminds us Orbital were often as much of a house act as a techno group - and also that Paul Hartnoll had a rather successful collaboration once with David Gray. Larks.Track nine: Where Is It Going? brings us back to the theme of the album: emotive, punchy classic Orbital, deceptively simple, positively angelic. The whole album, although not perfect, is a brilliant return to form and is the sound of two guys finding their mojo once again. Although you find yourself yearning for a long epic to finish with: Wonky is suddenly gone and the title of the last track is left dangling in the air.If this is their Paul McGann, then I'm already really looking forward to their Christopher Eccleston. Wait. Haven't they had him already?Orbital's history in brief: they're back and they're better than I expected. Wonky is one of their best.Further Fats: Some lists containing rhyming Autechre, Orbital in colour, and the entire history of dance music"},

The anniversary came and went.And then we have a poorly translated interview with Richard D James in El Pais. Here Señor Twin says he has nearly twice as many albums of material than the half dozen he'd mentioned a year previously.Also there is the tiresome speculation from yours truly, in which he does not have a new album (Feb 2009), he does have a new album (Mar 2009), he may or may not have a new album (Dec 2009), he has six new albums (Nov 2010), he does have a new album (Nov 2010), he doesn't have a new album (Nov 2010) and he distracts us with teddy bears (May 2011).Three years of speculation.

Grunge had fizzled away, as had the anti-Thatcher musical angst. What was left? Two things. Drum. And bass.LTJ Bukem was raised on jazz and classical music, and brought a melodic, breathy, atmospheric edge to drum 'n' bass missing from early jungle releases from the likes of General Levy. He seemed to build an empire with Good Looking Records, and it's thanks to him I got into Peshay, Photek and Blame.I was a hack on a local newspaper in the mid-1990s, uncomfortable in my own skin and hungry for new experiences. Clubbing was my release, and I still remember the first moment I saw Bukem in action. It was in a big tent with lots of dry ice and herbal smells. Within a few years, I would have perfected the long d&b beatmatch: those intricate beats are, whisper it, deceptively simple.Horizons is Bukem's signature tune, and it could be regarded as an anthem for the 1995 Me as I explored who I was, what I was into and how to get the next high.

Their 1996 album Don Solaris was a more ethereal affair: think Hacienda classics by stoned beach bums.Don Solaris' track seven, Lopez, featuring the vocals of James Dean Bradfield Out Of The Manics, was by no means the best track on the album. However, it was the one I'd find myself humming down the street in a year which not only saw 808 State headline a massive party five days after the IRA bombed the heck out of Manchester, it saw the death of my father.And so, I give you some lyrics from Lopez, which may explain why this one song summed my 1996. (Before this gets too weepy, I should also point out that my dad, who had an extensive record collection including Acker Bilk, Ella Fitzgerald, Cleo Laine and a huge classical collection, bloody hated techno and railed against the invention of the drum machine with some vigour.)Each sun feels like the last:Death is proclaimed at sunsetby a final light,Which darkness fillsWith every shade.Solitude bides time.Joy gives me my last regret.Joy gives me my last regret."},

My eyeballs are scorched with the burn marks of cynicism. I have less time than ever for new, magical things because I am too busy barrelling down the scree slope to death. And yet... and yet...I could have died in 2010. Surgery on my inner splodgy bits by some very good doctors ensured a fair few years of me to come. Which is good because I haven't yet planned my techno funeral. Luke Abbott's Brazil, from an album which should have been record of the year but wasn't, did two things for me in 2010:(1) it jet-washed the cynicism from my neolithic mind: here was a track that moved me as if I were a dewey-eyed kid all over again;(2) it provided an emotive soundtrack to an emotional year of incredible highs (the blog awards, new friendships) and incredible lows (the oxygen mask, the bleeping hospital machines...).Life accelerates. But when it's soundtracked by something this good, then it's worth the journey."},
{"title": "Bleep Years day fifteen: The Orb's Blue Room (1992)", "date": "Feb 22, 2012", "text": "Bleep Years continues. Join me on an amazing journey of discovery into my dull life. This time, it's a track from 20 years ago which, for those with calculators, makes me at least 20 years old.1992: The Orb's Blue RoomAt the turn of the 1990s, The Orb released three killer singles: Little Fluffy Clouds (which took an aeon to grab its deserved place in the top ten), Perpetual Dawn and Blue Room. Despite the diminutive fluffy clouds hanging in the public's memory for a long time afterwards, it was Blue Room that scored the highest chart position of the three.Blue Room was remarkable for two reasons. Firstly, the band's appearance on Top Of The Pops was no doubt a surprise to them. They turned out one of the show's most memorable performances: no-one has since played chess so intensely on a peak time music programme.And secondly, The Orb messed with the chart rules. By 1992, the KLF had become notorious for their coldy-calculated, ice-cool undermining of the rulebook. At the time of Blue Room's release, the the maximum allowable length for a single was 40 minutes. Most people would assume that meant the main single plus all the remixes. The Orb's track Blue Room came in at three seconds short of 40 minutes, giving radio stations heart attacks and giving The Orb the strange honour of having the longest hit single of all time.I was totally lost in The Orb's music back in the day: their dense audio worlds spun alien webs inside my addled noggin. It's only with hindsight that I've realised that, to some extent, I've also always aspire to their principles of 'event' performance and messing with the established rules. As for their chart record? They've changed the rules, so don't expect a Blue Room 2."},

(Sorry.)1993: Orbital's Planet Of The ShapesOrbital's brown album, or Untitled 2, or Orbital 2, was the album after Chime and Belfast and their green-covered, equally-untitled rave debut. Techno bands were starting to discover the album format and began to appeal as much to armchair slouchers as to clubbing gurners. The brown album combined dancefloor immediacy with the long player: tracks two to six were designed to be listened in one go.The most enduring tracks on the album were versions of older tracks, such as Remind and Halcyon+on+on. But the one that stays with me, the one that haunts me in the dark places, is track two, Planet Of The Shapes. It was the first Orbital track I heard all the way through and it was an ear-popping epic with lazers, moody synth lines and crashing drum beats. How I discovered the brown album is quite telling. I was turning 20 and felt like I was losing my childhood identity fast. I remember sitting in a tree writing down everything I thought I was and everything I wanted to be. Every longing and every hope cut me sharply at that age: I had a desperate need for connection.I brought out a copy of the NME whilst up the tree. It described a strange album without a name, full of weird noises, and I decided there and then that this was the music I was going to connect with - even though I hadn't heard a note. I bought Orbital's brown album as soon as I could.My love for Orbital continues. The tree has since fallen to the ground with age. I am still not everything I want to be. If I was still a teenager, I'd recognise the metaphor in that. But I'm not. I still like lasers, though."},

Acid Minors is the lead track on the Vocal Minority EP (cheapo video below), and if you download it, I've also thrown in a short story which is available on my Italic Eyeball site, but not quite in the sexy horse format contained on the EP. This latest release follows the Midnite EP from a few weeks ago.You can stream the EP on the Bandcamp site and on the newly sprung Hounds Of Hulme website , but it would also be nice if you bought it too because this kind of thing takes a lot of time - and horses cost a fortune to keep in doughnuts, broccoli and playing cards.

Well. They didn't write the rulebook, but on tracks like Cowgirl, they did it best best.Johnny Angular-Face's fingering of a Korg Kaoss Pad lent Kid A's Everything In Its Right Place a voice voodoo that was far removed from the band's status as the Greatest Rock Band Ever (copyright Q Magazine 1927). Suddenly, Radiohead were topping Orbital's mouth-manipulating collaborations with Noami Bedford and Goldfrapp.I remember seeing Kid A live, in which tracks for Amnesiac were also previewed. A bloke did a Noah-esque wee on a tent pole next to me. I also remember seeing Radiohead support James back in the smoky mists of pre-Oasis Manchester, a gig at which I had my first alcoholic drink. I can't remember what the drink was but it was in a bottle and the name, I think, ended in 'Ice'.Back in 2000, I used to make music without much success. I also had a Kaoss Pad. I seethed with jealousy at the angular bloke manipulating the pad's screen with a poetic dexterity. Still, this track represented a clash of rock and electronic music that hadn't really been properly explored for several years. The opening chord on Everything drops in from some new kind of place, and rock music has been playing catch-up ever since."},

Anyhoo, hey boy blog reader, hey girl blog reader, here we go...2004: Chemical Brothers: GalvanizeI consider the Grammy-winning Galvanize to be a great pop record, combining snappy vocals with the Chemicals' club aesthetic. It followed the duo's Singles 93-03 greatest hits album and it turned out to be their biggest hit of the decade.It's one of those tracks I didn't stop listening to, and its blatantly commercial bent has no doubt been an influence on the short tracks I've been producing as Hounds Of Hulme. I pushed my own button in 2004 (oo-er missus) when I left the comfort of my bookshop in Manchester for a new challenge managing a shop in Macclesfield. One of the downsides was that commuting stifled a lot of DJ opportunities, and eventually led me to drop the 'DJ' bit from 'DJ Fat Roland'.My time in Macclesfield, whilst spent with lovely people, stripped me to the bone on an emotional level. Other posts in this series will allude to more of that experience. I returned to working in Manchester spurred into action, ready to be myself again - very much, dare I say it, galvanised. See what I did there?I also have fond memories of the band's blistering sets in the 1990s when they didn't so much as rock the beats' blocks as pin the beats up against a wall and kick them to death. Galvanise links the joy of the 1990s with my recovery from difficult times in the late noughties. In short, it's better living through Chemicals."},

My little grid is filling up nicely.2002: Squarepusher's Love Will Tear Us ApartThe thing about being Mancunian is you get to live on a smug cloud of weed smoke and Hacienda dry ice whilst looking down on all the inferior people with their inferior musical heritages.  Are you from Dagenham? Loser. South Woodford? Bah. Hammersmith? Nottingham? North Weald? What have they got that Manchester lacks, apart from being the birthplaces of the various people in Depeche Mode?Squarepusher is roundly the greatest exponent of jazz drill 'n' bass that has ever lived, unless there's an especially impressive performing troupe of B&Q staff members I don't know about. My Sound was the first track I fell in love with, and his Shobaleader One project had its highlights too.Love Will Tear Us Apart is the only cover version in my Bleep Years list, and its a contentious one because any true Mancunian would have throttled him with a hooded top for attempting this. However, the icy claustrophobia Oh Square One lends this track is quite beautiful.And I can see myself in a Revolution bar, DJing in an alternative electronic room at a night called Backslider with some very lovely people, letting this track infect the airwaves of commercially-minded soul and pop fans. Happy days, good friends, and total DJing freedom.

Those figures don't quite make sense. Then again, I don't give 37 flying frogs so let's get on with it, shall we?2006: Jamie Lidell's A Little Bit More (Luke Vibert remix)After making his name as Wagon Christ in the 1990s, Luke Vibert became a kind of brother-in-acid with the more famous Aphex Twin. His best tracks included the seriously crunchy anthem I Love Acid, from the YosepH album, and the big beat goofiness of Lovely, from the Tally Ho! album.Meanwhile, singer Jamie Lidell was furrowing his own strange path, veering off from the predictable career path of soul singers and setting his musical satnav for the likes of Warp Records and Simian Mobile Disco. He added energetic layers of beatbox and loops in compelling live solo performances. And his voice was dead sexy.Vibert's remix of A Little Bit More mixed the techno mania with Lidell's soaring vocals, and it's impossible to see how that collaboration could have been achieved by any other pairing. It also best represented Warp Records move from purist electronica into other styles of music (hence releases from Battles and Grizzly Bear).I've chosen this track because it is such a massive tune, with an electronic backing that is as distinctive and as memorable as the vocal melody. No big emotional pull. No X Factor-style back story. Just, y'know, CHOONiness. Have an ear-peek..."},

But it was the Chris Cunningham-directed video for Come To Daddy that put Aphex Twin on the very urban, very decayed map. The highlight was a creature screaming the blue rinse out of an elderly lady (Coral Lorne, who went on to play Old Lady Who Gets Thrown Out Of Social Benefit Office in Spaced).Britannia became cool in 1997, but my own world was shattered from the death of my father at the end of the previous year. My newly orphaned ears picked up every musical nuance in 1997, and it is the one year in which I remember the most music, owned the most CDs, and learned the most lyrics. I dealt with my grief by surfing on sine waves all year long.For some, Come To Daddy is a brutal horror only eclipsed by the eye-popping Windowlicker two years later. For me, it is the ultimate Aphex moment: the perfect match of comedy, terror and very nasty beats. This song was also me being angry at losing my father, even though it took me years to twig the irony in the title."},

It's more of a representation, a fugure-head for what was happening to music in 2008. Although it's also true that Township Funk stuck in the grooves of my brain like cerebral belly button fluff.By 2008, Burial had scorched the earth, preparing the way for the opposing chart assaults of The XX and commercial dubstep. There was a shifting of the plates where older sounds (such as the cut 'n' thrusting Prefuse 73) would no longer do. In short, a lot of music was getting a little dull, and, no, that Aphex Twin revival was not coming.The DJ Mujava track was the most successful of a whole new groundswell of processed computer trickery. This was also the year of Ikonika's utterly unique Please, and it is also the year that saw the rise of Starkey, Hudson Mohawke, Rustie and, on a ravier scale, Zomby. So much rhyming, so much talent. Hyperdub Records were untouchable and electronic music was changing yet again.2008 was a quiet revival musically and, after a year like 2007, personally.

The London label crunched world music with post-rave head-beats and in the process brought us Natacha Atlas, Asian Dub Foundation and Fun-Da-Mental (the label's founder). Nation fans from back in the day will also remember collaborations with Jah Wobble and Mercury-winner Talvin Singh.They will also remember Loop Guru, a duo who took a less commercial path while others hippety-hopped up their tablas (a technical musical term - ahem - look it up). Loop Guru's Duyina is one of the most original debut albums of the decade, all twisted with short loops, transcendental spirituality and a straight-faced quirkiness that seemed to twin Asia with the hidden side of a distant, mysterious land.The third album track Jungle A matched a lazy chant with a basic Soul II Soul beat and has probably risen to the bubbling surface of my brain most months since I received the album as a promo from Nation Records 18 years ago. The experimentation and uncommercial stubbornness of the track defined my musical taste many years to come. I was barely in my 20s and yet I was looped up for life.Although they've not had much space on this blog before, Loop Guru became so important, I even named a radio feature after them last year.

Here's another year in my two-decade trawl of musical memories.2005: Venetian Snares' Szamár MadárSomewhere between his Planet Mu albums Winnipeg Is a Frozen Shithole and Cavalcade of Glee and Dadaist Happy Hardcore Pom Poms, the prolific junglist Venetian Snares came up with an album of Hungarian breakcore called Rossz Csillag Alatt Született. No. Stay with me.Breakcore artists (think drum 'n' bass mainlining a liquidised Duracell bunny) were often accused of anger and noise over emotion and delicacy. This one track from Rossz Csillag, called Szamár Madár, put that preconception into a cocked hat, sold the cocked hat to Roy Chubby Brown and had Roy Chubby Brown thrown into a meat grinder. Szamár Madár has emotion exploding from every bass note.Half of the track is a nagging orchestral line and half of it is mentalist snare rhythmics, making this both listenable and hardcore. By 2005, I was co-running regular nights in the Northern Quarter and I knew it was a good crowd if I could play this track without people complaining.More importantly, this track taught me the true beauty of difficult electronic music. For me, this became as listenable as Colplay would be for other, more cloth-eared pathetic people.

Today's randomly-chosen year is...2003: Plaid's Get What You Gave2003 was a big year for pop music. White Stripes enlisted their Seven Nation Army, Beyonce was Crazy In Love and Kelis had a line of dairy products that was proving popular with her male fans. Plaid. though, were calling back to a whole different era.Having released records for over a decade, by 2003 Plaid were already an amazing band. Their insistent, spiralling tunes were a nod to their origins as members of The Black Dog, a leading pioneer of intelligent, brain-driven techno. Plaid's album this year, Spokes, was hailed as a return to those roots.The debate continues as to whether Spokes is one of their better albums. One thing it did do was confirm their status as uber-ultra-lords of all electronica (official title). What I loved about the eighth track on the album, Get What You Gave, was the sheer simplicity: like steel drums on a Sunday drive along the rings of Saturn.This track is still one of my most DJed. The track acts as a very simple study in repetitive melody, with all manner of spikes and whirrs peppering proceedings from start to finish. There was no other song from this year that got under mys skin more, that slowly and carefully spread its tuneful darkness. Get me tipsy on a few of Kelis' milkshakes and I may even start raving that this is the number one anthem from electronica's number one band."},

They turned the ear of several national magazines when they released their debut single Plock, although it was probably an appearance on a Warp Records compilation that caught my attention. Their playful, playground techno was best summed up in Be Rude To Your School, a track on their 1999 debut album For Beginner Piano.I still think it's one of the best techno pop songs, and it was a cheery addition to my DJ sets at the time. I'd become quite adept at beatmixing big beat and drum 'n' bass, and 1999 saw me pulling off long, technically involved sets. Amid all of this, though, was a frustration that beatmatching was not enough.What I saw as a 'John Peel aesthetic', which puts the song before technical proficiency, meant that I started dropping in tracks that were impossible to beatmatch. This meant the complexities of Windowlicker, a classic single from 1999, and this catchy little track from Plone.Be Rude To Your School sparks images of DJ venues and of friends in smoky bars. The turn of the century was very much about me learning to DJ beyond just keeping beats together. Plone, in that regard, made me a more playful DJ, a silliness I was to mine for many years to come."},

If that's his real name.They tip their hat towards artists who are yet to enjoy major success, the Beeb stuffs the hat through a sorting hat and then the top five hats are put in order of hat.The Sound Of [Enter Year] rarely gets it right. In 2005, they chose The Bravery over Tom Vek, while winners have included Mika and 50 Cent (really?!).The rest of 2012's top five isn't relevant because I've just clicked away the tab in Firefox, but I'm pretty sure it comprises some soul singer, Niki & The Dove, a really sweary woman and a man named after the sea. The important thing is there is comedy dubstep at number four.In a revealing interview for the BBC, Skrillex says he has been jamming with Nero and, if you listen carefully, admits he takes a nap between his gigs and his aftershow parties. He seems like a nice guy. A tired, nice guy.If \"Zane Lowe\" likes him, then he's okay by me. Because we all love \"Zane Lowe\". As long as - and this is an appeal from my steaming bowels - Skrillex stops doing that thing with his hands. Seriously..."},
{"title": "Hounds Of Hulme: Midnite EP (final promo video 3)", "date": "Jan 4, 2012", "text": "Edit: The Midnite EP can now be bought here: only a quid! Oh and this, incidentally, is the 600th post on Fat Roland On Electronica.Street teams have been walking every avenue of the country promoting the inevitable number one single from Hounds Of Hulme, posting flyers through doors, shouting the track names through loudhailers and spray-painting the band logo on children's faces.Of course, that's not true. There's no street team. When one of your band members is a horse (see the band line-up on the Bandcamp page), you spend most of your time clearing the poo-droppings from the mixing desk. At least, we would if we had a mixing desk. Or a shovel. We use our hands. In fact, we have fashioned all the horse manure into a big brown pretend mixing desk.All I have is my final promotional video, which is pretty similar to the others. And this is how I'm describing the EP:\"3 tracks of glitchy techno packaged with artwork, a hilarious two-page PDF survival guide to one of the tracks and a bonus bad quality video... all for only a quid.\"The video is really bad, although it's fun. At one point I was recording moving pictures of my own wallpaper. The promo videos here are only a screenshot from one frame. If you want to see the full three minutes, you'll have to buy the EP, obviously.I've released a few Hounds Of Hulme tracks over the past few months. Yes, I kept it quiet. One of them was the backing track for this advert for Quickies: Short Stories For Adults, while another track was described as a \"sparse and minimalist mechanoid meltdown glitch funk groove\" and compared to EMF, Eskimos in Egypt, Jesus Jones and Wagon Christ. Which was perceptive because I own records by all four bands on vinyl or on tape or on wax cylinder.Hardly anyone will take notice of the Hounds so if the Midnite EP sells more than a handful, I'll crack open the champagne / Toblerone. Roll on Monday... watch out for the pre-order appearing on Bandcamp later this week.Edit: This was the 600th post on this blog, so I've plopped in a bit of artwork to celebrate the fact. If you like the artwork, it will be available as a permanent tattoo on Etsy in the next few minutes."},

{"title": "Best electronica albums of 2011: number 1", "date": "Dec 31, 2011", "text": "Brummie music thinkbod Andrew Dubber recently railed against the habit of hacks writing off 2011 as the ‘year of boring music’. He argued that it said more about the paucity of stimulation in the journalists’ lives rather than a lack of good quality music.“I suspect that it is not our musicians that have let us down, but our champions of music.\"So if your job is to report upon popular music and you are unable to find ten incredible things in the past year to share with those of us who still read what you have to say, then that makes you a failure.”“John Peel-ism should be the norm,” he added.Let me extend that thought. If you’ve ever liked a YouTube music video then left a comment declaring old music to be way better than the mulch that is spooned down our gullets today, then you might as well piss all over John Peel’s grave, suck up the urine from the soil, wait for it to digest, then take a second slash whilst banging on about how the first piss was a nicer shade of yellow.My difficulty was not finding ten incredible things, but narrowing it down to an arbitrary number that inevitably led me to exclude something quite important....[This is part four. Click here for part one. Click here for part two. Click here for part three.]Some also rans...James Blake’s album James Blake (Atlas). The most important underground electronic music artist of the past year is not in my top ten, despite me doing everything I could into tricking you into thinking he was Album Of The Year at the end of my previous post. Sorry 'bout that.Last December, I indicated the excitement that preceded his debut album. When it finally came it, I felt it was playing to a quite different audience. An intricate album full of beautiful bass that even caught the attention of Beyonce – but there were ten other incredible things I wanted to share more than Blake's LP.Other also-rans include new kids on the block, Cant. I found their album Dreams Come True (Warp) too band-y. I believe the monumentally entertaining Ceephax Acid Crew had an Unstoppable Phax Machine (030303), but I didn't get the memo, whilst there was no space in the top ten for the industrial glory of Byetone’s Symeta (Raster Notion) nor for Brian Eno’s poet-poking Drums Between The Bells (Warp).Which only leaves one thing: a young Glasgow musician who’s brandishing something long, transparent and deadly. It’s a glass sword. That was a reference to a glass sword. Not his penis.1 - Rustie - Glass SwordsThe arpeggiated mayhem of Zig-Zag was the first moment beat-nuts took notice of Rustie. With that track and the 2009 highlight Bad Science EP, he very much sounded like a kid earning his dues in the Lucky Me collective’s electronic workshop.Meanwhile, his mentors Hudson Mohawke and Mike Slott lead the way for the Glaswegians with, respectively, the Butter and Lucky 9Teen albums. Rustie, perhaps, sounded like the talented apprentice playing with the Nintendo in the corner, biding his time until...Glass Swords (Warp). It takes three minutes for the first insane slap bass to cut through the ambience to make way for an orgy of portamento mayhem and retro computer game wizardry.It brings to mind the retro synth mischief of Lorn, whose 2010 debut sounded like a naughty Knight Rider breaking into the Blade Runner film set. Rustie’s debut takes that philosophy much further. If Lorn was Kansas in black and white, Glass Swords is so far over the rainbow, it has hypercoloured the sun itself.This is the sound of a young pretender dicking about with his software, which would be really annoying at a party, but committed to record it is a joy. He pumps up the Hudson Mohawke beat aesthetic until it bursts.All Night is a soul jam at the most disgusting sex party ever to be held in your bass bins. Hover Traps is simply the catchiest tune of 2011, Globes sounds like drums crashing against the dawn of time, while After Light throbs with so much minor chord desire between the cut-up voices and blistering bass, you’ll be writing love letters to Glass Swords well into your pensionable years.Every synth crunch on Glass Swords is a Glasgow kiss that requires, if you so please, your full bleeping attention. And it is all underpinned with a crystal-clear balance of melody and emotion. It feels to good to have Rustie battering my ear drums. You know how you can get fish to nibble your corn-encrusted feet in pretentious shopping centres? In this case, your feet are your ears and instead of fish there are nice things like pies and ice pops and bacon Frazzles.Which reminds me, I’m hungry. Rustie's Glass Swords is my Album Of The Year 2011 because it matters and I'll be humming it in a year's time. Do have a listen below. Thank you for reading my blog in 2011. It has been an extraordinary year in many ways, and none of it would be possible if lovely people like you didn’t dip your eyes in my word sludge every now and then. Let’s do the same in 2012, only more ridiculous, more unrestrained and with more bacon Frazzles. Did I tell you I was hungry?[This is part four. Click here for part one. Click here for part two. Click here for part three.]We are approaching the Album Of The Year much in the same way an astronaut with an upside-down map is heading for the sun. By the time you finish reading this blog post, you should be in a position to try and guess the winner of this year’s top accolade.Meanwhile, let’s check out the nearly gang in our penultimate collection of also-rans. Once that's done, we'll crank up the Top Of The Bleeps theme music with numbers 4 to 2.[This is part three. Click here for part one. Click here for part two. Click here for part four.]Some also-ransI’m very sad to exclude Björk, especially after her triumphant performance of the Attenborough-tastic Biophilia (One Little Indian). She had a Tesla coil for crap’s sake. However, although she is on top of her game right now, it’s not really electronica of the Fat Roland On Electronica variety.At the very bottom of their game is Paris’s own Justice, whose new album Audio, Video, Disco (Ed Banger) was such a mess, I wasn’t sure if Spinal Tap were having a seizure: at first amusing then just painful and sad. Imagine The Who teaming up with David Guetta. No, it wouldn’t be fantastic, you’re wrong. In 2011, Justice made me cross.Mark Pritchard and Steve Spacek’s Africa HiTech project was a joy to the ears: 93 Million Miles (Warp) was bristling with bass and bad attitude – but not a top ten spot. Also not in the top ten is Biosphere, whose nuclear-themed concept album N-Plants (Touch) was gorgeous and just okay at the same time, while SBTRKT’s SBTRKT (Young Turks) was filed along with Nero in the grey bin next to my desk marked ‘pop’.4 - Modeselektor - Monkeytown In 1998, Thom Yorke threw a rabbit into the headlights and set the standard for guest vocalists on Unkle’s debut Psyence Fiction. It’s remarkable then that he should return all these years later and equal that achievement on Modeselektor’s third album Monkeytown (Monkeytown). It’s not the first time they have worked together, of course, but the tracks Shipwreck and This are hypnotic and beguiling.Beyond the Yorkie bombs are other highlights: the hotstepping German Clap, the digital urgency of the loping Grillwalker, the emotive melody on the PVT-collaboration Green Light and the absurd hip hop of Pretentious Friends (“the pâté was fabulous!”).We’re so spoilt with this Berlin duo’s dexterity, confidence and (whisper it) pop sensibilities, it almost seems a shame that the claustrophobic Shipwreck b-side Dull Hull isn’t on show too.Unstoppable, bass-driven, ear-hugging digitalism: this is the rise of the town of the monkeys. Come on my ‘selektor.3 - Plaid - ScintilliPlaid are a duo that arose from godfathers of bleepery The Black Dog and became the techno musician’s techno musician, much in the same way that Stewart Lee is the comedian’s comedian and your great granddad is the racist’s racist.Until now, Spokes was their best post-1990s album: it had amazing tunes but, unlike actual spokes, didn’t quite hang together as a whole. Scintilli (Warp) is the scintillating icing on the, um, spoke cake.Opening with jingling guitars, which brings to mind 2001’s Eyen, we’re quickly smothered with choral sorrow and their trademark awkward chord progressions. Eye Robot brings in the fuzzy techno, Thank leads us into the cheery eeriness seen on many a Plaid album and by the fourth track, the anthemnic Dr Who work-out of Unbank, we’re ready for a tea break. The rest of the album careers from sunny dance numbers (African Woods) to sheer strangeness (Talk To Us), but it’s all perfectly Plaid.This band has spent five years dabbling in other media, most notably for their audio-visual project Greedy Baby, but they have been in danger of seeing their traditional fans drift off. In that respect, Plaid have checked themselves and produced their best album for at least ten years.2 - Martyn - Ghost PeopleThe Brainfeeder label was the success story of 2010, with important releases from Lorn, Teebs and The Gaslamp Killer, and a crucial partnership with Ninja Tune. They were responsible for the return of Mr Ozio this year and they were even a headline feature in the Guardian a month or two ago.All along, however, I felt that without a Brainfeeder-labelled album from their godlike founder Flying Lotus (he releases on Warp), they’d never quite crack it. They just needed something... something extra. I don’t know. Something indefinable. A ghost, maybe.Ghost People (Brainfeeder) is a spectre to behold and should be the album that propels Brainfeeder into the premier league. I’m mixing metaphors again. Martyn has produced an aural dystopia in which shards of rave and techno have darkness cast upon them until they glisten molten musical antimatter.Popgun could just be bouncy Joy Orbison dubstep with the occasional vocal grunt, but the atmospherics lift the sound into something greater than its parts. The driving Bauplan is so beautifully melodic, you either want to go for a run or a cry. And the choppy We Are You In The Future sounds like the theme music for every techno track ever recorded. Everyone is trying this sound, but Martyn does it best.I wrestled over the decision whether to make Martyn’s Ghost People my album of the year or not. But no. There is another. A debut album so great, so absorbing, with such unique production, it ought to have every kid with a smidgen of soul mimicking his sound. Stay tuned, dear reader, for my Album Of The Year 2011.[This is part three. Click here for part one. Click here for part two. Click here for part four.]"},

Have a look at my previous post, why don’t you.Before we fondle the edges of the top five, let’s have a look at some more people that coulda been a contender but they weren't because I wiped them on the doormat on the way in.[This is part two. Click here for part one. Click here for part three. Click here for part four.]Some also-ransIt’s always a tightrope wobble producing this annual series of blog posts, because I don’t want my top ten to be too guitary. Metronomy fell just about on the wrong side of the divide so they are not included in my final list, but that doesn’t stop The English Riviera (Because) being one of the best albums for ages.Katy B, darling of what I call the Radio 1 dubstep scene, did wonders for Magnetic Man. However, On A Mission (Rinse) didn’t convert me and she misses out on the top ten. Again. At this rate Skream will be round my place brandishing a pointed microphone stand. Again.Balam Acab’s liquid loveliness on Wander / Wonder (Tri Angle) missed out on a place in the final list, which is a shame for such a brittle marvel. Thundercat’s The Golden Age Of Apocalypse (Brainfeeder) was too jazz funk for my tastes while Shigeto’s Full Circle Remixes and Gold Panda’s Companion (Ghostly International) walk away from this blog with nothing more than this brief mention right here in this sentence just here.7 - The Field - Looping State Of MindLike an agoraphobic moo-cow, I have been ignoring The Field. In 2007, his album From Here We Go Sublime scooped critical praise but it skittered past me because I was probably too busy listening to The Klaxons. And so to 2011, when I finally not only listened to The Field, but I whacked them straight into my top ten with their Looping State Of Mind (Kompakt).The album opens with the soft siren call of Is This Power, which is all very nice, then they hit you with the monumental It’s Up There, a chugging 4:4 builder not a million miles from Rez-era Underworld. Arpeggiated Love too has a special kind of 10-minute stuck-needle aesthetic.It’s probably the easiest listen in this whole top ten, but there’s something about the slow evolution of each song, the recurring sounds and the minimalism that helped this album find a particularly warm spot in my listening hole.6 - Gil Scott-Heron & Jamie XX - We’re New HereDubstep is a term batted about more than Max Mosley’s bum in a dungeon, and I’m not sure it means anything anymore in a world in which Benga, Burial and Skrillex all lay claim to the term. Post-dubstep is easier. If it’s someone electronic trying to sound like The xx, then it’s post-dubstep. We’re New Here (XL) is post-dubstep. Apparently.Jamie XX’s stroke of genius was only choosing to use the vocals when remixing Gil Scott-Heron’s 2010 album I’m New Here. He loaded his remixes with future party goodness and created an album that stands on its own. An instant classic and an essential for your record collection, Mr XX’s incredible attention to detail will keep you glued to the speakers. We’re New Here has bouncy bass (NY Is Killing Me), house music (I’ll Take Care Of U), utter beat mayhem (The Crutch) , all underpinning lashings of that smoky, smoky voice.A true pioneer bringing another true pioneer to a new audience. Gil Scott-Heron, lost to us all in 2011, lives on in the dub.5 - Surgeon - Breaking The FrameTaking a million years out doesn’t tend to encourage a quality comeback (see James Cameron’s Avatar or the Stone Roses’s Second Coming), but by the sounds of the furious techno on offer on Breaking The Frame (Dynamic Tension), Surgeon has been percolating quite nicely.He is in an utterly uncompromising mood, but as the static anger of Radiance gives in to the harps from hell on Presence, there is beauty here too. An evil beauty.The loops are tight although they still give the impression of an army of machines with steam valves and dangerous malfunctions, the hisses and the gasps stretching out loosely over waspish choirs and malevolent melodics. In some ways, it’s a throw-back to the faceless, tuneless Tresor techno of the 1990s: you know, when dance music was good. And most importantly, more than any artist of 2011, Surgeon stands out as someone unwilling to bend, someone out to please only himself; a man and his machines and, as a result, a bunch of slobbering (and terrified) techno fans.[This is part two.

{"title": "Best electronica albums of 2011: numbers 10 to 8", "date": "Dec 29, 2011", "text": "Welcome to my annual review of the best electronica albums. I must start dear reader, with an apology. I got it wrong last year: Luke Abbott's Holkham Drones (Border Community) languished at number three on 2010’s list, but repeated plays makes me think it should have taken the top spot. Oh well. Mount Kimbie ain’t giving their crown back.So no pressure then. This year’s best electronica list is, if I may say so, utter brillsocks. Every album featured I love to bits, have slept with several times and have moved into a bungalow with. Before we lap up the goodness, let’s see some of the tracks I spat out. After that, we’ll crack on with the top ten.[This is part one. Click here for part two. Click here for part three. Click here for part four.]Some also-ransWalls were darlings of the ambient community in 2010, so they went and ditched the driftiness and took up dance beats instead. Their album Coracle (Kompakt) was closer to techno and therefore closer to my heart, but it wasn’t enough to make the list.Bibio scored highly in my best electronica review two years ago but 2011’s Mind Bokeh (Warp) seemed confused: their sub-Orson rock song Take Off Your Shirt was, well, like Orson. Meanwhile, Tycho's Dive (Ghostly International) was lovely, Zomby’s Dedication (4AD) didn’t quite do it for me, while I got Dave Monolith’s Welcome (Rephlex) for Christmas and haven’t had time to absorb it yet.10 - Falty DL - You Stand UncertainYou Stand Uncertain (Planet Mu) is such a complete world and yet, by all rights, it ought to be a disconnected mess of rave, house, r’n’b and techno samples.Take Lucky Luciano. It starts with some slow-motion rave riffery, hypes it up with some breakbeat samba and “oooh yeah” vocal samples, throws in some frenetic funky drummer-ness and suddenly we’re in a watery world of 808 State techno followed by some drill’n’bass-lite. The fact that this one track holds together is a miracle, never mind the album as a whole.I’m less keen when it gets too far down the garage path and I could do without the female vocal tracks: they feel too much like a bid for radio play. You Stand Uncertain works better in the abstract as repeated melodies work their way into your brain and hang around for the rest of the record, or when a new opposing theme drifts into the music as if uninvited and the whole records hangs beautifully in the delicate, titular uncertainty.9 - Machinedrum - Room(s)If Travis Stewart was an actual machine, he’d be a bit rusty around the wingnuts because he’s been in service now for ten years as Machinedrum, Sepalcure, Tstewart and Syndrone. A brief flirtation with Glasgow’s Lucky Me record label oiled his creativity as he left behind his glitchy past in favour of more upfront electro. Room(s) (Planet Mu) is the full-flexing realisation of that change: swirling vocals and complex breakbeats abound.In fact, that’s pretty much the motif of Room(s). Busy rave rhythms agitate echoing soul vocals, such as the “for real” refrain of Now U Know Tha Deal 4 Real, the auto tuned U Don’t Survive or the people wailing at the choppy synths in The Statue. A highlight is the additively repetitive She Died There. And with a lot of the tracks coming in at the four or five minute mark, Mr Drum knows how to structure things so that nothing outstays its welcome. Pitchfork wrote off this album as “devoid of its creators voice” – they couldn’t be more wrong.8 - Kuedo - SeverantThree Planet Mu albums in a row: crikes. I never thought a Carly Simon sample would end up in my annual album reviews, but it’s happened thanks to the fifth track on Kuedo’s debut album which sees the famous “la de dah de dah” refrain from the ‘80s songstress go to battle with a helicopter or at the very least, a synthesiser that dearly wants to be a helicopter. Next up, Burial doing Coming Around Again on a hovercraft?Kuedo is a new name around these parts, but most will recognise him as remixer and producer Jamie Vex’d out of, um Vex’d. There is not much comparison, however. While Vex’d The Duo snarled and growled like some crazed darkstep killing monster, and Jamie Vex’d The Soloist sounded like Ninja Tune down a k-hole, the new Kuedo project has a different flavour.  Severant (Planet Mu) sounds like a Vangelis remix album. It is a landscape of yearning 1980s chord sequences (Truth Flood), cinematic analogue ambience (Salt Lake Cuts) and delicate melancholia (Visioning Shared Tomorrows). This album will pluck your heart strings until they shimmer.[This is part one. Click here for part two. Click here for part three. Click here for part four.]"},

A stunning directorial debut from Paddy Considine that slowly smudges your sympathies from black and white into grey. The violence is often more malevolent than just physical force so this is not a film for the faint-hearted. But hey, it's about a Christian working in a charity shop, so it's all light and fluffy, yeah?4 - Source Code Groundhog Day condensed to eight minutes. The extremely false set-up of Source Code makes Flight Of The Navigator look like Newsnight, but the time restriction lights a narrative touch-paper that produces a thrilling science fiction blockbuster that stimulates the intelligence and lies somewhere between Quantum Leap, Unstoppable and, um, 50 First Dates.3 - Troll Hunter“Troll!” Welcome to Cloverfjord where the Scandinavian troll legend is realised in its full CGI horror. Otto Jesperson’s deadpan poacher is as concerned with red tape as he is with the creatures he is hunting. A pseudo-documentary with black comedy teeth, this is a delight from start to finish and unlike anything else at the cinema this year. The bridge thing? Best film moment of 2011. Read more at Screen 150. 2 - Submarine2011 was a brilliant year for British directorial debuts, but it’s Richard Ayoade (IT Crowd, Nathan Barley, Mighty Boosh, Darkplace) that takes the honours with a debut brought to us by him, Warp Films and Ben Stiller.A geeky paranoid boy tries to solve his parents’ relationship problems whilst trying to hook up with the girl he both loves and fears. The girl in question is Yasmin Paige who withers more than Jeremy Paxman in a heatwave. A quotable script, a massive funny bone, great music and pitch-perfect visual motifs that return you to your own paranoid childhood (a fairground, a Polaroid camera, a kaleidoscope). The comedy of the year.1 - SennaA documentary is my film of the year.So why should this share such a prestigious honour (hey, stop laughing) with Another Year (2010) and Where The Wild Things Are (2009)? Although I like formula one, Senna was before my time and so the film held no emotional pull for me as I walked into the flicks: in fact, I'm always apprehensive of sport in movies. What I experienced though was movie-making of the highest grade.The film follows the racing star in the ten years leading up to his death, eschewing normal racing footage for intimate high-speed close-ups and behind-the-scenes tension. We see Senna the god but then Senna the battler as he falls foul of the authorities. As the film approaches its Titanic moment, the doom is played out with a cold steadiness that will either have you on the edge of your seat or cowering behind it. Because it’s not just Senna and Ratzenberger that were victims during that fateful weekend...Senna tells a narrative and lets the racing take second place, and that's why it is such a triumph. It brings to mind not other sporting movies, but rockumentary Dig! which funnelled acres of doco footage into an equally compelling tale. Director Asif Kapadia clearly picked only certain elements of Senna's controversial life during his edit (there were 15,000 hours of footage), but he hasn't gone all Iron Lady on us. Instead, he has compellingly told a story that resonates through time. At 18,000rpm.[This is part three. Click here for part one. Click here for part two.

Time to start the top ten, in which you will find aliens, wallpaper and dinosaurs.[This is part two. Click here for part one. Click here for part three. See also 2010 and 2009.]10 - Attack The BlockHoodies take on aliens in a funny and, yes, believable debut from the one who isn’t Adam from Adam & Joe. The yoots rob and prowl and ought to be the real villains, but once the terrifying shadowy claws start ripping them to shreds, our loyalties remain firmly in the four walls of the London tower blocks. A pleasure to see an 'urban' film where the protagonists are, beneath the hoodies, quite normal.9 - Black SwanNatalie Portman goes mental, or does she, and is she really Natalie Portman? Black Swan is full of directorial tricks designed to confuse the viewer and I hated it on first watch. But the feathery beast kept pecking away at me until it pulled me under. And now I think it’s the best ballet-masturbation combination of 2011.8 - The King’s SpeechColin Firth, on a roll from A Single Man and, er, St Trinians 2, takes the stutter rap as he walks into a delightful culture clash with straight-talking Geoffrey Rush. The Rush family wallpaper was worth the cinema ticket alone. All Firth needs to do now is to go back in time and do the same for Geoffrey in Shine. Oscar or no Oscar, this is the drama of the year: think Frost / Nixon with bluer blood.7 - We Need To Talk About KevinThe impossibly thin Tilda Swinton descends to motherhood hell as her impossibly thin offspring Ezra Miller turns from Damien into a high school killer. It's difficult to build tension when the foreshadows of the bloody climax loom larger than Miller's massive scowl, but this tale of painful alienation and archery sparks from the screen thanks in no small part to its photo-perfect arthouse cinematography.    6 - The Tree Of LifeThe entire universe is created, Brad Pitt and Sean Penn think about stuff, the entire universe dies. Not one for your Twilight audience, Terence Mallick’s ambitious epic is more like a tone poem than a narrative - although there is a story in there somewhere.

The Adjustment Bureau, about men in hats walking through walls, was entertaining if not original, while Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy ticked all the boxes but failed to be greater than the sum of its parts. Kill List was my hands-down film of the year until the ending reduced it to a laughable failure. And Paul simply wasn’t good enough to be included.Tron Legacy would have been in my top ten last year, but I saw it after I’d written my write-up and now it’s too late to join this year’s list. Yes, it was trash, but it was rezzed-up techno trash and I Daft-Punking loved it. Also, I finally saw Catfish (otherwise known as the other Facebook film) and was mightily entertained if a little paranoid about ever logging on again. 15 - Super 8Part Stand By Me, part Close Encounters, this is JJ Abrams’ love letter to Stephen Spielberg. Which is a bit like The Hulk taking up needlecraft. The ‘berg served as producer for this wide-eyed adventure story, which is probably why the movie manages to soften the stupendously moronic storyline with a dash of nostalgia and more than a little warmth.14 - The Inbetweeners MoviePopular television comedy writ large for the big screen? If that idea of that doesn’t fill you with dread, then you’ve never seen The Simpsons Movie. As it is, the film delivers the requisite quota of fannies and bums and silly dancing despite the woeful near-absence of Greg Davies. Any film that gets Kylie to say \"clunge\" at an awards ceremony gets my vote.13 - True GritFor any other film makers, Bear Man (“I have taken his teeth: I will entertain an offer for the rest of him”) would be their best character ever. But these are the Coens and they play oddball better than anyone. True Grit is a solid remake shot with a slow and steady hand and is only slightly spoilt by an action-led last act that seems a bit unCoeny.12 - Arthur ChristmasYes, really. A red-nosed Christmas classic co-written by Peter ‘Alan Partridge’ Baynham and with all the adult nuances of Nick Park’s more famous inventor and dog. A glittering cast helps: Laurie, McAvoy, Jensen, Broadbent, Palin, Staunton and Nighy (“right down the Rodney hole!”). It really didn't need the 3D, so leave those stupid specs at home.11 - The FighterChristian Bale does crazy and Mark Wahlberg does Rocky in a film that ought to be a knock-off of an old idea, but is brought to life with two compelling central performances and a gaggle of Christopher Guest-style ensemble characters clad in amazing mullets. Empire Of The Sun and the Funky Bunch seem like such a long time ago.[This is part one. Click here for part two. Click here for part three. See also 2010 and 2009.]"},

In the past fortnight or so, you may have seen me read a story about a desperate shop manager at ReTale, try out my Brian Cox dirtiness at Exhibit C, watched me spew out my first 20-minute set at Blank Space and have authors spluttering into their beer at Word Soup.The aftermath of my Blank Space set can be seen in this picture. This represents the fall-out of five stories told in my, um, particular style. Even the guitar is mine, although it only has five strings because I used the high E to floss my toes whilst high on envelope glue. You know. LIKE YOU DO.My latest empublishment is a story called If You Were The Only Boy In The World, which I will read at this Wednesday's Bad Language birthday bash. The story can be found in their new anthology, to be launched screaming at the public on the same night.And after that, I'll do something stupid at Say Something. An event a week. That's my plan. And if you want the full Fat Roland fiction treatment and you can provide a good audience, I'll do a 20 minute set for you.Meanwhile, do pop your nose into the Manchester literature \"scene\". Some say it is somewhat self-regarding, but that's why we did the Beatoff Generation manifesto. It's welcoming and open and a lot of fun: why else would a natural outsider like me be involved.I'll leave you with some lovely words about Bad Language, who have done so much to support new talent in this city. Katie Anderson writes about her literary open mic performance there (a story \"sort of about ghosts, but not really\", which is the best kind of ghost story), while Aaron Gow recalls his first stage performance at Bad Language as being \"slightly addictive\".A year, a week and a day is a long time at Fat Roland towers.

The only thing I have left on CD are Echobelly's Greatest Hits, that collaboration between The Kooks and Kraftwerk, and Tina Turner tribute band The Nutbush City Mimicks.I'm not sure if those CDs even exist. I'm not sure of anything any more.The positive side of being computerless is I got off my anus yesterday and had a lovely Sunday lunch.

It all kicks off from 4pm on Sunday at Blank Space in Hulme.They're aiming for a speak-easy vibe, with spoken word, poetry and music courtesy of any old sops that turn up to the open mic. Why not be a sop yourself and come and take to the stage? Some time before 7pm, I will headline proceedings along with performance poet and installation artist Rebecca Joy Sharp.I'm billed as \"spoken word\", which is an anodyne phrase which is a bit like saying \"sounds like Coldplay\". Then again, I dislike the phrase \"flash fiction\", but if it's a wording I've got to wear to persuade you to turn up and listen, then pass me the tattooist needle.It's my first proper fiction set.

{"title": "I got the pop song, I got the melody", "date": "Nov 2, 2011", "text": "Earworms.I think that's what they call them. Earworms are those snippets of melody that lodge themselves in the tissue of your brain.At the moment, I have a merry-go-round of cacophony in my head. Part of the noise is a disco record that I can't quite put my finger on. It may be the Jackson 5. There's a bit of Womack and Womack in there too. It then morphs into Sydney Youngblood's If Only I Could. He's a cheery German Texan who raised the ire of dance music rival Soul II Soul back in the late 1980s with his chippy cheerful rip-off soul pop.But not the chorus of If Only I Could. Oh no. Just the start of the verse and the few bars leading up to that.Which is my problem with earworms. The sign of a good producer or songwriter is their ability to make even the innocuous bits of the song sound as amazing as the obvious hooky bits. Everyone from Trevor Horn to Timbaland is good at this, and it means that a wriggly little earworm can crawl from anywhere in the deep depths of popular music and surprise you with its catchy little hooky teeth.What I'm saying is, really, that there's too much melody out there. It would be nice for everyone to have a lovely chorus, something-- y'know-- really smashing, and for the rest of the song to be a tuneless, forgettable dirge. It worked for the likes of Echobelly, Oasis, Aliyah, U2 and pretty much any artist beginning with a vowel. East 17. Adele. Elbow. Every artist beginning with a vowel. Every single one. It works. Try it.The only way to rid your mind of an earworm is to scoop your cranium empty with the digger your Uncle Dave nicked from the local university building works last Tuesday. Or have a reputable pop impressario such as Gary Glitter, jonathan King or Michael Jackson's corpse do one of those worm-charming things on your skull and tap your bonce incessantly with a long stick.I call them earworms. What do you call them? What's in your head right now? Am I just asking this to give the impression of interactivity on this blog? Yes. I'm not interested, so bog off. Unless you want to sing me a song in the comments. A lovely, smashing uncatchy song."},

Thank you, little chicken nugget of wisdom.Which leads me on to the announcement I had teased you with at the end of this post.As I concentrate more on my fiction noodling, it's quite likely Fat Roland On Electronica will suffer. It has become the runt of my writing litter, albeit a cute runt with fabulous eyelashes. Which is a shame because Fat Roland Dot Com The Domain Name will be ten years old in February.And so it only seems fair to show this website some love. It is my intention early next year to produce a book of this blog.The paper-drizzled book version of this blog will be as in thrall to the cult ofAphex Twin as much as to the full horror of Justin Biebpipe.Scrawled in the pages within, you will find numerous giddy joys: selected writings from the blog itself beefed up by extensive  footnotes written exclusively for the book; plenty of new blatherings about buffalo, music and kettles; original illustrations, by which I mean mad scribblings   drawn with the ear wax of a cat; assorted lists, puzzles and other pointless distractions; and finally, a complete glossary of stupid terms so you too   can sound  intelligent about electronic music whilst  secretly being a moron.  If you are a publisher and you would like to publish this (ahem, hello publishers, AHEM), then get in touch. But in any case, it will happen and you will buy it. Right? Right?This nuggety runt just got its game on.I find myself at the Tory party conference, which is very similar to a business conference except they know the business is bust and the man who runs the defence department has given all the revenue to his mates.This is my ongoing story, told through tweets, of a wishy-lefty washy running a bookshop at a right-wing event.

Yesterday can be summarised as a bunch of people in suits and bad hair that don't know please, thanks or excuse me.The founder of MORI delighted me with stories.

She was in every way a spitting image of Margaret Thatcher.\"\"I have five book signings today at the conference, including the aforesaid Jeremy Paxman (who is actually lovely).\"With a busy day ahead, I was feeling quite confident. A bit like a Christian looking at a photograph of a kitten in the Colosseum and thinking, \"oh THAT'S a lion.\"In fact, let's stick with animal analogies, shall we? \"Everyone's much nicer today at the Tories.

What rhymes with 'nuzzle'?\"Muzzle, obviously.My colleagues who had run set-up had nestled some Tony Benn books on the shelf, which by good fortune was in the exact place where cameras would film the book signings. And believe me, there were cameras everywhere. Events like this, whatever the party, is as much about media image as it is about motivating your troops.I couldn't move without finding myself in someone's shot:\"I got stopped coming into the Tory conference for carrying coins. Of course I'm carrying coins. I'm selling books.Other items possibly considered dangerous at the Tory conference: clothes, hands, air.\"\"Oh crap, a TV camera has just filmed me. I'm sorry I said bad things about clothes and hands and air.\"I even received tweets about being on the telly: \"You're on the telly. And you're selling a book. Money has changed hands. Congratulations.\"\"The Graun have just interviewed me, wanting to know the successes (Kwasi Kwarteng) and turkeys (Assange).Oh dear.\"In fact, some Tories couldn't cope with Kwasi Kwarteng. They don't like foreigners, you see. And Kwarteng is very foreign, being an Etonian, a Surrey MP and, oh hold on...\"Crikes. \"Have you got that book by the man with a Korean name. Totally unpronounceable.\" That'll be Kwasi Kwarteng, then.So sheltered. This conference is one big head stuck in a big cloud.\"Korea. West Africa. Eton. It's all the same. Bless.Anyhoo, we did a signing with various MPs, including Kwasi (who I'm pretty sure is responsible for spilling coffee over one of my books, harrumph). The highlight, however, had to be Sir Paxman Of Newsnight who I had persuaded to do a last-minute book signing.Boy, he was hard work. He withers in his spare time and, while always witty, personable and intelligent (I'd do another signing with him tomorrow if given the chance), his batteries still fire away when the rest of us have ground to a halt. His banter with the book-buying public was priceless.\"My book is so good, you should buy ten copies: some for your family and five or six for you. In fact, let's make it 15.\"\"I have one leg shorter than the other by about an inch and a half.\" \"You want to go to Newcastle and be hung upside down? Yes, brilliant idea.\" \"Are you going to tell me what underwear you're wearing?\"\"The quotes earlier today were from the university challenged Sir Jezbo of Paxmania, all taken out of context from his book signing.\"We ran out of books (understandable considering the signing wasn't planned) and so we had a little argument about that because Paxman was unhappy.So I leave Part Two of this series with a couple of final tweets from the day.Still to come is my attendance at an alarming fringe event and, as promised on my previous post, a truly scatalogical moment which represents more about the Tory party than even its critics would be prepared to accept. No, me having a poo further up this post wasn't it.Oh and I must tell you how the Theresa May cat moment increased our sales.\"I managed to rile Jeremy Paxman today. I accept full responsibility if he's being more withering than normal with Boris on Newsnight!\"\"My bookshop was on Newsnight, apparently.

Jeremy Paxman would become a key part of this year's bookshop. He (or his people) had decided not to do a book signing, so when he turned up to the shop, I managed to pin him down. He would do a signing. And it would be one of the most exhausting moments of the conference. More of that later.Everyone who's everyone is here. There's a Tory with massive testicles (bad trousers). And there's Nick Robinson. Hitchens. *shudder* There are less shouty motivational posters this year.

{"title": "Five-point Manchester survival guide for freshers", "date": "Sep 18, 2011", "text": "Welcome to the straggly-haired slaughter, you fresh-faced lambs. Here is the official Fat Roland guide to being a fresher.You arrived in Manchester today lugging your duvet under your spindly arms after doing that passive-aggressive eye thing as you left your parents behind for good. You have chosen the right city: Manchester invented computers, music, politics, card games and the Nintendo Wii.;But how do you survive in the Northern capital that also brought the world Madchester drug casualties, murderous Hacienda bouncers and, shudder, more than a few members of the BeeGees?One. You need to know where to hang out. One wrong move, and you'll be bundled into an alley and piddled on by a tramp. These are the only places you should hang out in your first year of university: your halls, the Student's Union, anything with a Wetherspoon's logo, Tib Street, Ancoats and, after two in the morning, Deansgate train station.Two. You have to listen to the right music. Generally, if it's got a guitar and sounds needy, it's middle-class pseudo-angst and you might as well get minute Laura Marling faces tattooed on your nipples. If it's got keyboards and the players of the keyboard  sport cool hair, it could be hipster, in which case you might as well hang out at Common Bar in a cloud of your own farts. Any other kind of music is acceptable.Three. Don't get in my way. Don't use buses. Don't walk down streets. Don't sit in bars, although if you really have to, for goodness sake don't talk. Only go to the cinema on Orange Wednesdays because that's exactly the day I don't go to the cinema. Do come into my bookshop and buy some books, but only if you're fit / cute / might be fit when you're 25.Four. Catch as many diseases as you can, and ensure you pass them on to as many Manchester residents as possible. Illness reduces crime (and let's be honest, you're going to get robbed blind in those shoddy student digs), boosts immune systems, and I really like laughing at people thinking their world's going to end because they've got a cold. Yes, women, you do it too. Incidentally, I don't intend to catch the cold virus ever again, so this doesn't affect me. You get extra points for sexual diseases, especially if picked up on the dance floor of 5th Avenue / Cruz 101 / the Christian Union Christmas party.And finally, five. Don't use anything digital. Unplugged is cool and preserves the 1950s culture in which Manchester truly thrives. You don't think the Happy Mondays used electricity, did you? It was all done with tooth 'n' comb and a kazoo doused in liquid LSD. Ditch your modern appliances. Buy your singles on seven inch. Get proper books. Wash your clothes using poorly-dressed maidens in a scullery. If you need to learn something, go to a library or ask a busker. And stay off blogs, because the amount of effluence dripping from their so-called good advice guides would be enough to turn Doctor Crippin's stomach.New students: welcome to Manchester. We gave you M People, Dolly Parton and Kraftwerk. (Probably, I dunno.)

It's my spiritual and artistic home and it's even Mark Thomas' second-favourite festival.This year, I had two DJing slots in the Jesus Arms organic ale tent, which gave me the chance to do a dark set (techno and IDM on the Saturday night) and a light set (ambient and 4/4 beats on the Monday night). My co-DJ Dan flipped things in a different direction with the likes of Desmond Dekker and Prince.Being in such close proximity to beer attracted the usual punter comments:- Have you got any Beatles?- Have you got any Abba?- Have you got anything with a tune?That last comment, dear readers, really means \"have you got anything that I recognise\" because most people want spoon-feeding with the same old mulch. It's a minority view, so I didn't compromise: back-to-back Autechre tracks were a personal highlight.The picture shows the free software we used to DJ with. A massive thanks to Dan (who really needs a snazzy DJ name, like DJ Dan The Destroyobot or something) who not only brought proper good choons but also brought the kit to make it all work."},

I'. sure, once I can no longer call myself \"blogger of the year\", it'll be back to the purple tins and sitting outside the Co-op.But I have been busy. For example, I will perform my umpteenth fiction reading at Manchester's leading literary shindig Bad Language this Wednesday, August 31st. I'm hugely grateful for Bad Language's support: they have been the driving force behind my newly-discovered love of short story writing.And don't forget the wonderfully-named Bad Shoes Festival on September 25th in Chorlton. Bad Shoes is a joint mission between Bad Language and that temple of gorgeousness, Shoestring Magazine. At the festival, I'll join the Flashtag Writers for a fiction reading of sorts. Ah, the Flashtag gang. It seems like an eternity since we congealed our efforts around this stupendously stupid blog post last November.Oh, that reminds me. We're doing a book. We're doing a disgusting book of smutty stories for Didsbury Arts Festival. Quickes: Stories For Adults in in the editing / typesetting phase and features work by us, by specially commissioned writers and by general submissions. We're going to launch it on September 28th, and it would be great if you could come-- er-- be there.What else? I'm bound to miss something. I've resurrected by photograph microfiction thingy blog Fatotograf. Me and a few Sanctus 1 chums will be giving out fish this weekend in a new short story experiment. I ran a fun blog workshop for Full Circle Arts and Blank Media. My coming out story is the subject of an Art With Heat project for Manchester Pride (yes, I'm in that video!). You can find me DJing on Saturday and Monday nights at the Greenbelt Arts Festival. There's stuff going on with Manchester Science Festival, but it's not quite announceable yet. And I am currently uploading a few 100-character stories over at Italic Eyeball.Oh and to take my mind off all of the above, I just wrote this. Like I said. Astronaut. Screams. Spaceosphere."},
{"title": "All Warp Records stock destroyed in Sony / PIAS fire", "date": "Aug 11, 2011", "text": "I had been chiselling out a blog post about the Sony DADC warehouse fire that claimed the stock of scores of independent record labels in the UK, including Warp Records. \r\rToday, Warp issued a statement on how the fire, caused by the London riots, had affected them. It was not good news. \r\r\"All of Warp's UK stock appears to have been lost in the fire,\" say Warp. \r\rRead that again. Horrible. \r\r\"The Sony DADC warehouse also acted as our international distribution hub and so this has affected our ability to supply our overseas partners.\" \r\rThey go on to state that forthcoming released by Grizzly Bear offshoot CANT (as obtuse a name as !!!), uber knob-twonk Rustie and techno veterans Plaid will go ahead, but that funtime high-cymballed beat combo Battles may have to cope with a digital-only version of their next single My Machines. \r\rLabel Love is a campaign to raise cash for the many labels affected by the blaze. There is one event already scheduled, and I hope Manchester can organise something similar. PIAS, who sub-contract the warehouse, have also teamed up with the Association of Independent Music to support those affected. \r\rBut the worry is not just financial. \r\r\"The biggest challenge for us,\" continues the statement, \"is replacing Warp's extensive back catalogue spanning the last 21 years. We will replace as much of this as we can by creating new stock and replenishing where possible with stock from outside the UK. Unfortunately some releases may never be available physically again.\" \r\r\"We will be closely supporting PIAS in their efforts to get the independent music community up and running as quickly as they can.\" \r\rThere's not much else to say. My planned blog post, full of theoretical blatherings about the wider affect of the fire and the riots, has been thrown into the bin. All that remains is a deep sadness for Warp Records and the effect of this incident on the legacy that has fed this blog for years. \r\rNot just Warp, either, of course. A full list of labels follows in small print. \r\rAll that, before we even get to the human tragedy of the stupid, stupid riots.

The text of this follows.To respect the SEO aspect of this blog post, I have edited out the name of the guy Murkage wrote about. His name has been blanked from my blog post and from Anonymous's response (which is also why I've had to delete Anonymous's comment).It should be pointed out that Murkage retained respect for Cloud 9 throughout all of this and there is no question that Cloud 9 clearly rocks. They just had a problem with one person.Anonymous's comment: \"____  ____ issued a public apology to Murkage for any upset that he caused.\"Just to clarify Hannah Cox is the promoter for Cloud 9 Festival and the band were dealt with by her in a professional manner throughout the event as they pointed out on their post.

{"title": "A piffling statistical analysis of the 27-club", "date": "Jul 25, 2011", "text": "This week, we lost a talented singer because there is something built into human nature that means, sometimes, the power of addiction is stronger than the power to survive.I don't want to write a blog post about Amy Winehouse. guy_interrupted has already nailed it in words, while Paul Gambaccini has bottled it perfectly on a BBC video despite appearing to be in the middle of a nasty upper-lip infection.What I want to do is focus on is the response. Or rather, a little thing that happened amid the torrent of tweets that either paid tribute to Amy Winehouse or, oddly, slagged off those paying tribute to Amy Winehouse because the slaggers thought their own tribute was more worthy.Many people on the netosphere took offence that people were declaring that Amy had joined the 27-club. That's the elite list of rock stars that died aged 27. It seemed trite to mention a piffling statistic, they said. And yes, it is trite.And disrespectful.But since you are reading a blog that came up with the Bri Chart, an analysis of Boring Pauls, a point-by-point comparison of Karen O and Brian Eno and an admittedly impressive list of crowd-sourced Aphex Twin animal puns, and since I've never been too concerned about crowd-pleasing on this festering corner of the interweb, I might as well analyse the 27-club claim.For more sensitive readers, this may turn out to be too scientific for your feeble brains. I advise you to switch off your computer now and lie down in a dark room.Firstly, I need good stats. I should look no further than a King James Bible fan site called 'av1611' that tries to demonstrate that rock stars \"DIE in youth, and their life is among the unclean\" because \"their rock is not our Rock\".They have a massive chart of rock star deaths that shows the average age of rock star death is less than half that of the average American death rate. It's pretty convincing.The fact that a musician who became a teen rock star in the 1960s isn't old enough yet to reach the American mean survival age is a triviality of which, I suspect, their God would not approve.And so there's Johnny Ace, the Youngest Rock Star Ever To Die. Suicide at 25. You remember Johnny Ace, yeah? He played trombone in the Bluetones or something.And then there's Frank Zappa, the Oldest Rock Star Ever To Die. Cancer at 52. Or, as the site would insist, 'Wages Of Sin' at 52.This is science. Pay attention.Usefully, the fundamentalist Christian website lists the death ages of almost all of the 300+ listed. And so I embarked on a deep exploration of the data on this site. How? I copied and pasted it to Excel.The result demonstrates there is a 27-club of sorts. On their list, 17 rock stars died age 27. They are:Chris Bell from Big Star (pictured);Dennes Boon from Minutemen;Kurt Cobain from Nirvana;Les Harvey from Stone The Crows;Jimi Hendrix from his own Experience;Robert JohnsonBrian Jones from the 'Stones;Janis JoplinJohnny KiddHelmut Koellen from Triumvirate;Jimmy McCulloch from Wings;Ron 'Pigpen' McKernan from the Grateful Dead;Jim Morrison from The Doors;Gary Thain from Uriah Heap;Jason Thirsk from Pennywise;Al Wilson from Canned Heat;Wallace Yohn from Chase.My Excel spreadsheet also shows, however, that 16 admittedly less-famous rock stars died age 38. The 27-club also has some fairly well populated neighbours: 13 died aged 30 and 13 kicked the bucket aged 24.As a result of that extremely accurate analysis from a fundie-God site (as representative of real Christianity as shoe-bombers are of real Islam), I'd like to suggest we rename the 27-club.It is henceforth known as the 27-38-24-30-and-some-other-ages-inbetween-but-mostly-27-kind-of-doesn't-really-matter-anyway-club. Everyone who agrees on Twitter, stamp your feet 27 times. No. 38 times. No..."},

{"title": "This is a review of an Aphex Twin gig", "date": "Jun 13, 2011", "text": "Aphex Twin's* massive stadium tour, played out to 1.75 million people, finished its run in Manchester at the weekend.I'd followed Aphex Twin back in the day, even to the point of having his posters up on my wall and everything. After he split in 1996, I wasn't too bothered, but since he reformed, I've developed an odd penchant for going to see him live.Here's me on the bus going to see Aphex Twin. The bus was packed full of Aphex Twin fans.At this point, I was wondering if I'd recognise any of his new songs. He's never exactly been cutting edge, but that edge has seemed significantly blunted in the past few years.At first, I thought this sign on the wall was an Aphex Twin track title.It turns out, this was something to do with the football that was normally played in the stadium in which the Aphex Twin concert was taking place.As my eyes drifted along the typeface, I asked myself how many of the 55,000 Aphex Twin fans at the gig would recognise these names.Aphex Twin's supporting band was a duo. Probably Boards Of Canada or something.Boards Of Canada has followed Aphex Twin for the whole tour. Normally, Boards Of Canada would put on their own flamboyant shows. In this case, their set was rather stripped down.That didn't stop them having odd backing singers, such as these colourful block people with blocky heads (pictured inside a big screen head).Here's the lead singer of Probably Boards Of Canada Or Something.He was called Neil. He wore mostly black, while his keyboardist Chris wore mostly white.I could only capture a picture of Neil on the big screen because I was so far from the stage, to capture the real him would have taken a lens the size of the Norway.Boards Of Canada's best song was Left To My Own Devices. When Aphex Twin took to the stage, the stadium went mental.I was a little busy reading a Fyodor Dostoevsky short story collection. My friend Nici, who got me the ticket, looked at me a little oddly. I decided that Notes From The Underground could wait until later.I thought that Aphex Twin looked good for his age.Then a long-lost Aphex Twin member came on stage and started singing his  own stuff. He was evil and there was fire and everything. Then there was a whole lot of dancing in monk costumes and weird cult stuff, then some spangly tops and aerobatic mechanic performances. This was to demonstrate the theme of the evening about progress from mass idol worship to modern science. This was, remember, at a capacity gig of 55,000 worshipping fans.And then there was a robot. This most definitely explains why Aphex Twin hasn't produced an album for a long time. He's been in his shed clanging together a buggery robot killer, which sauntered from the back of the stage, looked evil for a bit, then went round attacking people with robot zombie lazers. Maybe I embellished that bit a little.I had seen Aphex Twin before, on their reunion concert when Patience came out. This was as impressive in its own way, but it seemed to be full of great ideas that didn't quite form a whole. With the robot's mechanical problems, the signature piece (robot's hand) didn't happen, and so the robot seemed like a loose end, like an electronic drunk staggering its way through a pop concert and walking off into the audience without so much as a handshake with the stage performers.Also, having seen Venetian Snares* at the Arena recently, and having watched her absolutely kill it with Spinning Around, Slow and Love At First Sight, maybe I was coming into this piece of theatre (and that's pretty much what it is) a little spoilt. Still, Robbie from Aphex Twin was a tour-de-force, despite obvious signs of various bodily abuses. The band's banter with the audience was lovely, and it's nice to see them still strongly identifying themselves with Manchester.And yes, the new stuff is nowhere near as good as their old stuff (which in itself was confined to a short semi-acoustic section midway through). Some of the routines were clumsy, but there was plenty of pow and woo and smart wizzy moves to remind us that this act, ageing though they are, Aphex Twin may still be the best pop group out there.*some names have been changed in this article to protect the writer's credibility"},

You can read it if you want to. The tale will be especially pleasing for people who like speedboats, Lenor or guttering.Anyhoo, Battles were superb, what with their complicated rhythms and unreasonably-constructed high-cymballed drum kit. It took me back to 1926 when I first discovered post rock, back in the days when music had to have subtitles because it was still all silent.Manchester blogging legend The Pigeon Post got a shout-out from Star Slinger, which was lovely because it felt like \"one for the bloggers\". And I ended the night at the Greenroom for one last hurrah as that brilliant venue was finally mothballed.It was strange, then, that there was a sour taste to the night. For that taste, we have to look to a curious no-show from one of the support acts: Actress. You cannot underestimate the hugeness of Actress. He co-founded Hyperdub and through his Werk label has brought us Starkey, Lukid and Zomby. I called his Splazsh LP an \"essential album for 2010\". I was looking forward to his set more than the others.Despite the hype (NewsicMoos pick of the week, for example), Actress forgot to put the date in his diary. He simply didn't turn up. It's not the first time, of course: he also failed to show at Deviation and Eastern Electrics' bank holiday bash in London a week ago.My views on artists that don't do their jobs has been made crystal clear on these blog pages before now.I'm not sure how to react. I can't tweet him because he's deleted his account. And he hasn't updated the Werk Discs website for a couple of years.There's only one thing for it. I'm boycotting all actresses.I now dedicate my life to the following:- an entire absence of Nicole Kidman;- approximately zero amounts of Michelle Williams;- no Greta Garbo;- not a single Halle Berry: not even one;- a gaping hole where Imelda Staunton should be; - no Whoopi Goldberg, although to be honest...;- Grace Kelly? Not on your nelly;- I'm even boycotting Frances McDormand. Don't try and stop me.Actress has driven me to this. I'm prepared to unleash a torrent of similar boycotts, so watch out - especially Zomby, Deadboy and Border Community's Lazy Fat People."},

It is, after all, in Chorlton.For those unaware of this trendy suburb of Manchester, Chorlton invented cous cous, bags-for-life and gormless dragons.However, the Flash Mob Literary Salon is not posh because I had a hand in organising it. And my hands are dirtied from moss, tree bark and lichen. They are gnarled, like an old woman's eyelids.Let me tell you a story. Of how the Flash Mob Literary Salon came about. Once upon a time, on a dark and stormy night, I ran a writing competition with some friends. They were Benjamin Judge, Lonlonranch, 330 Words and Words & Fixtures, Lots of people entered. Two weeks ago, we shortlisted 12 entries.This Thursday's Literary Salon is the awards night, in which the shorlistees, along with me and my friends, will be reading their stories. Nik Perring will be our guest reader and we'll reveal the winners of our competition in a glittering ceremony. The end. Everyone lived happily ever after.If you haven't seen me seize a stage before, this could be your chance to capture the full theatrical Fat Roland. In recent months, I have taken to short stories like a pelican to an oil slick. Bad Language have kindly allowed me to do several performances in which I have distributed toothpaste, taped a story to my chest and thrown my reading material, screwed-up and useless, onto the stage floor. (Do go to Bad Language's anthology launch tomorrow.)My favourite pieces include 25 Words About Supercharged Beyonce, which does what it says on the tin, Sometimes In Life It Seems Like You Have Choices, which was inspired by a vision I had of bunnies cascading off a buffalo's back, and a story about a newly married couple and a boat-building tenant which should be turning up on Gumbo Press soon.You can my stories at Bionic Matthew's Pen Of Doom (although some of the earlier ones are a bit first drafty for my liking). And if you would like me to come to your short story night, you can book me here.Meanwhile, I will see you at the Flash Mob Literary Salon, which is not posh, this Thursday 7.30pm-9.30pm at Dulcimer in Chorlton. It's part of Chorlton Arts Festival and will be broadcast on Chorlton FM, so stick that cous cous in your pipe and smoke it.See also: the time when we tried to start a literary scenePicture: Gill Moore"},
{"title": "ThingKong FingerFuture", "date": "May 23, 2011", "text": "Time to catch up on my blogging of FutureEverything festival.I was still nursing my bruises and my bristle-burns from the face-hug I got during the previous night's punk gig, so I looked for something light and airy on the FutureEverything calendar.'Geeks Go Camping' it was. Far from being a workshop on how to build a four-person tent from the remnants of discarded computer towers, this seminar explored the idea of programmers balancing their intellectual and physical energy. It compared codes to nature, although mental images of white-skinned web surfers making solo treks up the Khyber did little to dispel the stereotype of geeks being loners.Meanwhile, 'We Are Forests' was brilliant. It's a public art project that started in Bristol on the premise of \"what would you whisper in a stanger's ear\". So you get handed a note and you're in a market space and you answer a phone and you listen to a voice and you get a mood and you get a narrative and you have to speak into the phone and you hear other people speaking into the phone and you have your words sung by strangers at the end and then, and only then, you read what's written on your note.Of course, we didn't do all of that. It was seminar about it, but it did sound exciting.The rest of the day was also mixed. The audio / visual tomfoolery in the Kraak gallery was a feast for the eyes, ears and fingers. You can see me swishing water in a pool in a video below. Meanwhile, Rob Da Bank's re-scoring of King Kong was equally interesting and frustrating. Interesting because it's Rob Da Bank in a gorilla suit playing Flying Lotus at a 1933 film. But frustrating because he failed to capture the mood of the piece.King Kong is loaded with pathos and sadness, and yet his choice of tracks seemed inconsistent. Yes, do play dubstep when Kong is attacking, but to overlay the death scene with the obvious (and biologically incorrect) Monkey Gone To Heaven seemed lazy. Some of the lighter moments worked, but it descended into trite.It was almost as if Rob Da Bank had knocked his performance together at the last minute. As someone who has done a lot of this kind of 'soundtracking', I can be bold enough to claim that, given the time and funding, I could definitely do a much better job.I'll sum up FutureEverything 2011 in my next post. In the meantime, here are some pretty pictures.     The Kraak gallery had a pool of light which you could manipulate with your hand.Listening to the sounds of various cities at the Kraak gallery. It worked really well when you set all the cities off at once to create a terrifying urban dystopia.   The conference venue. A rolling soundscape: in this case, I listened to Chris Swithinbank's La leggerezza delle città A bluescreen experiment (which went slightly wrong) in the lovely Umbro design studio. An installation that is so narcissistic, it counts itself.... and that is the exhibition. Loved it.   A band that only rehearsed online before meeting together for a quick dress rehearsal. I'm not sure if it just wasn't my type of music, but it sounded like everyone was trying to play at once."},

The launch was friendly, personal and, when it came to FE founder Drew Hemmett talking about arts funding, thoughtful.FE, you see, got a wad of cash while places like the Greenroom are closing: not for the first time, Drew's speech reflected Manchester's pain with great sensitivity.FutureEverything has its own base this year. It's at Four Piccadilly Place, which you will spot if you stand in Piccadilly Gardens, stand on the tram tracks and choo-choo your way to the train station. You will spot the FE building as the track falls to the right as it takes you towards UMIST.The launch was a great chance to catch The Data Dimension, a meditation on data visualisation that you can see in the space for the next ten days. I'll finish this blog post with some pictures from that exhibition.Meanwhile, I have two days of being afraid of all things geeky as I become a proper FutureEverything conference delegate.

{"title": "Oysterthing Pandarubbish", "date": "May 16, 2011", "text": "Diving into my first full day of the FutureEverything festival was like springboarding into a swimming pool of motherboards, microchips and pliers. It looks different, but it's painful on first contact and is difficult to navigate through.It was certainly a far call from my last trip to the event when it was called FutureSonic and it had weirdos circuit-bending into Gameboys at the Contact Theatre. Now, it was all about data, meta-data and, um, whatever comes after meta-data.Still, for every couple of sessions that befuddled me, there was one that pricked my ears. I learned about 'things that no longer exist', which talked about objects being made up of the real world and the data world. For example, an Oyster card is partly physical card but is mostly invisible data.And so we had objects made up of material and memories (a stripey pink jumper with a barbeque smell), to Poltergiest (the film, not an actual one) and Heidegger's profound observation that the \"Old High German word 'thing' means a gathering.\"The Guardian did a couple of sessions. One, about data and journalism, reminded us that it's all about people and not just machines, although the people in this instance provided a disorganised and dull seminar.Another session, about robots and editors, was brilliant and equated Trip Advisor reviews with stepping on other people's experiences, declared that robots were evil and had a magical rainbow-vomiting panda.Anyhoo, in the evening, I went to see Fucked Up. It was an alarming mixture of extremism, love, danger and inclusivity. I'd liken it to the best rave moments at Sankey's Soap and, I think, solidified Islington Mill's reputation as one of the best venues around.That is, if the venue still exists. The audience insisted on trying to pull the roof down (hence the lead singer's worried \"guys, those are water pipes\" announcement near the end of the show).Not much to photograph today, but here goes...The Fucked Up lead singer spent most of the time grabbing the crowd, including me. This photo is by Andrew Fisher.The magical rainbow-vomiting panda pair had some brilliant visuals.Look! Punk pigeons in the Northern Quarter!  I told you I didn't have many photos.Now I'm getting desperate. Honest, there'll be more photos on my next FutureEverything roundup."},

You can  next vote tonight by contacting my radio programme from 8pm - 9pm, with the grand results being revealed from 9.30pm. Tune in to find out how.If you know your Aphex Twin from your Orbital, then please take part in my poll. Battle of the Computer Bands is a grand survey for my radio show in May. I'd like your list of who you think are the most important electronica artists of the last 20 years. A top five, decided by a points system, will be revealed on my radio programme, with some voters getting namechecks on air.For details on how to vote, read on.What you're voting onWhen deciding on the most important electronica artists of the last 20 years, think of electronic music of the techno / IDM / Warp Records tradition, so no chart-topping pop / autotune pap. We're talking armchair techno onwards (1991 was the year of Orbital's green album, and a lot has happened since). It's not just about your favourites: think consistency and influence as well as general level of amazeballs.My top artists would, for example, include Orbital, The Black Dog, 808 State, Flying Lotus, Underworld, Mu-Ziq, Aphex Twin, Burial, Autechre and Richard H Kirk among others, although I've not decided on an order yet. And anyway, I don't get to vote.Need help choosing artists? Wikipedia has this history of IDM music to prompt you.The rulesHere are the house rules:- You can submit as many or as few names as you like, as long as they are ranked with the most important *first*. If you can only think of one, that is also fine. If it's a long list, I will probably only take notice of your first ten.- Only one list per person. You cannot vote for your own project. Please don't vote-rig or get others to vote a certain way. Suspect lists will be eliminated, destroyed and then killed.- If something is nowhere near IDM / electronica, that vote will be quietly ignored. How I judge this is entirely dependent on the amount of sleep / sex / Windowlene I've had.- Voting will finish at 9pm on May 19th, an hour into the radio programme, with the results revealed between 9 and 10pm on air then, later, online.- Any derision aimed at my Battle of the Computer Bands title will be met with the fact that I nearly called this poll Chorlton And The Bleepies, which makes even less sense.How to voteI'll leave you with details on how to vote. Go to it, chums!- leave a comment on this post;- tweet me @fatroland;- email me: computerbands (at) fatroland.com;- contact the programme when it's on air (details nearer the time) although lots of pre-show votes would be lovely.Thanks, in advance!Edit: Voting is suspended.

For several hours yesterday, the official Twitter feed on scoutingforgirls.com displayed some remarkably odd tweets:- working on some more shit tunes.- Oops... turns out Elvis IS dead. Let us know of factual innacuracies in our other songs and we'll write (irritating) corrected versions.- Robbie WIlliams showed that anyone can rap well. We'e thinking of giving it a bash for our next single. Rap-a-rap-rap!

See if you can guess who!- time UP! the one in the hat went for the wee, whatever his name is.- just to let you know, Danny Dyer will be the warm up DJ for our next tour. pwopa nawtee!A quick, um, scout of the internet shows @SFGOfficial being pimped by the funk-dribbling piano fops for some time, but it seems they never got round to registering the Twitter account.And so a wag by the name of Chappers took up the name and started tweeting as Scouting For Girls. The tweets fed automatically to the group's website. They were funny. A (very) small segment of pop history was made.Chappers, a web-head and occasional DJ based quite near me in Stockport, was quick to offer the account back to the group's management. They grumpily referred the matter to Sony, while the band themselves seemed to take it on the chin.The 'Girls said on their own Twitter account: \"Thank you to everyone who complained when out twitter account got hacked into! Just seen it. Quite funny - fairplay!\"  Although it should be pointed out, the account wasn't hacked and was simply the result of a slip in web design by their record company.All very well and fluffy. No harm done. Everyone had a giggle at the expense of an awful band. Except this whole fandango has had a much more dire consequence that anyone had imagined. This will have repercussions way beyond what happened over five hours yesterday.  It means I am now following Scouting For Girls on Twitter.   The moment Chappers handed SFGOfficial back to the band's management, I suddenly found myself as an official fanboy of Scouting For Girls.   I have never followed an awful band on Twitter. 7,000 tweets and two years into my Twitter career, and this has ruined me. I am following Scouting For Girls.This fact cannot be denied.I've had to buy into the 'Girls. I am their follower, after all. I've bought t-shirts. I've bought all the singles. I've listened to far too much Ben Folds Five. I am now TGFSFG: Totally Gay For Scouting For Girls.It has left me in a world of Topman jackets, sensible fonts and Jamiroquai posters. I now like to hear the lyrics in a pop song. A good melody. I don't even like Aphex Twin any more. I mean, it's just noise, isn't it?Everything's changing, as Keane would say. Chappers is pop music's evil nemesis, while I am a brain-dead fanboy. The whole balance of music has tilted, and all because Scouting For Girls had the indecency to be crap in the first place.After all, if they didn't make the kind of music that is probably liked by Liberal Democrats, this whole saga would never have happened. Yeah. You heard. Liberal Democrats.Harrumph. Scouting For bloody Girls. Happy now?"},

I didn't mention a police scanner in my basement. Mental Breakdown:I totally love this list. I can't get enough of it. (The sound of that, a thousand times.)Driving:The heartbeat of a spider amplified 60,000 times through a complex system of tubing.Flashback:The recording I took through the thin walls of my hut whilst my neighbours were having rumpytime.Getting Back Together:The derisory voice of the judge sentencing me to 100 hours of community service for recording through the thin walls of my hut whilst my neighbours were having rumpytime.Wedding:The slow scrape of entropy I sometimes hear in the bones of friends but am too afraid to mention.Paying the Dues:Things I have shouted into the pointy end of traffic cones.The Night Before The War:The distant echoes of long-dead kitchen maids calling from inside my oven.Final Battle:Something by Bon Jovi. Don't know the title but it sounds quite manly.Moment of Triumph:A one-second sample which sounds like 'plink', although it's a bit more of a 'ding' with less of a tail-off at the end. Think of the noise your brain makes when you think of a good idea, then mix it with the sound you make when you stub your metal-capped Doc Martins against the kettle when you're playing ticky-off-the-ground in your grandmother's kitchen when she's too busy out back smoking meth.

{"title": "Psycho bunny, qu'est-ce que c'est?", "date": "Apr 19, 2011", "text": "Now to the small matter of a truly international Manchester record label: one leg in this city and the other leg in Dubai.Borland and From The Kites Of San Quentin have released a split 12\" full of giddy ambience and beats that are snappier than crocodiles playing card games. More about the music in a moment: allow me for a second to literally judge a record by its cover...Gulf Records is a collaboration between local boy Rob Gregg out of prog bleepers Borland and Daniel Fogg, who was single-handedly responsible for getting me into Lorn.Although an equal collaboration between the two, Fogg is currently living it large on the Arabian Peninsula, so Gregg is hot-footing it around record shops with trouser pockets full of vinyl.Yes, vinyl. Their debut release comes on a beautiful slab of vinyl, its cover adorned with the psycho Donnie Darko rabbit (my mutilated version can be seen above). I went to the launch at Centro recently, and it was truly a pleasure to get something heavy and touchable slapped into my hand (stop it) rather than a piddling little CD or a URL to a streaming site.Each cover is hand-daubed with red paint, with copies available at the Japanchester charity gig boasting Japanese-style red circles on the back. It's good to see Gulf Records 'getting' vinyl.As for the music, what we have is Chet Beaverbrooke by From The Kites Of San Quentin, which is a 'ladies and gentlemen we are floating in space' ambient psych-out with Billie-Holiday-on-heroin vocals.It settles itself somewhere near chill-out (splutter, wash my mouth out), but being of an older school, the trippy spoken word drops remind me of The Orb. The disgustingly dirty bass that lands at around the three and a half minute mark suggests this is a beast of a much darker pelt.Clockmen by Borland spits a growling melodic progression onto the floor of witch house then slurps it up with a hefty dose of melancholy. That track is ripped into seven shards of bad boy on the b-side as each artist remixes the other. Borland's take on the Kites track is the closest the 12\" gets to a head-nodder, with its flip-book snare adding crunch to a delicious overdose of shimmering effects.Chet Beaverbrooke / Clockmen is a bold debut, is difficult to categorise despite other reviewers' unconvincing comparisons to Four Tet, and is lovely to slap in your hand. I suggest you buy yourself one now: what better treat for Easter weekend than a psycho bunny?"},
{"title": "The Stone Roses and the seriously stained alley of nostalgia", "date": "Apr 8, 2011", "text": "Edit: I was clearly way off the mark in this piece. Here are my 2016 reflections on the new Stone Roses single.The Stone Roses are reforming. The Stone Roses are not reforming. The Stone Roses are reforming. The Stone Roses are not reforming. The Stone Roses might be reforming.Manchester was awash with speculation yesterday. It's the only thing people were talking about in the porn shops. Drug dealers whispered the news from beneath street grids. All the flyers in Affleck's Palace were replaced with pictures of Ian Brown next to a big question mark.In fact, Manchester does nostalgia almost as well as Liverpool, what with reformations by the likes of James, M People and, um, Northside. When in fact what we really want back are our dearly deceased, such as Joy Division, Frank Sidebottom and Together.Although the cod-blues drudgery on the second Stone Roses album was a crock of anal splatter, the band's contribution to rock music stands as proudly as the Beetham Tower and we Mancunians should shout about it. Well. Drawl about it.What we didn't need, though, was another trip down a syringe-ridden nostalgia alley. We'd just end up vomiting into our navals and using our hoody to wipe up the sick, thereby creating an ironically-pleasing hypercolour design on our clothing. How on earth can they recapture the Bez days of our lives? Stand in Harvey Nicks and pretend it's the Hacienda? No, thanks.The rumours were quashed pretty quickly. Many commentators took a (private) post-funeral piss-up between ex-band members as genuine news. But Mani himself gave a journalist a right old ear-pummelling about the rumours, ending his rant with \"It isn't true and isn't happening.\"The Stone Roses are not reforming. The Stone Roses are not reforming. The Stone Roses are not reforming. Let the whispers become murmers then shouts: the Stone Roses will not come again.See also: How do you solve a problem like Madchester?"},
{"title": "I went to see Kylie...", "date": "Apr 4, 2011", "text": "...however, it will be almost impossible to explain what I saw, other than to say the phrase \"that's the gayest thing I've ever seen\" in increasingly shrill tones. So:- A half-naked man angel: that's the gayest thing I've ever seen.- Kylie singing to a half-naked man angel: that's the gayest thing I've ever seen.- Kylie riding around in the air singing on the back of a half-naked man angel: that's the gayest thing I've ever seen.- Kylie singing There Must Be An Angel to the half-naked man angel: that's the gayest thing I've ever seen.Chariots, Greek baths, golden shells, S&M slaves, sychronised swimming, a massive Kylie bust (not that kind of bust), and a huge man fountain. This was not Aphex Twin.Here are some blurry photographs that weren't completely ruined by me shaking from heart palpatations.She's on the back of a chariot in this one: Here comes the angel:    The fountain climax. Some of it looks like the dancers are weeing, but actually they're performing acrobatics on sodden ropes in increasingly precarious ways. The biggest jets of water are just out of shot:      I'll be re-enacting this one on the fountain outside Manchester town hall:I've been juggling three records with my many eared-tentacles of music appreciation. But I only want to talk about one, which is Falty DL's You Stand Uncertain. Much has been made of DL's genre-slurping production skills, taking in two decades of dance music. It does genre-hop, but mainly in one one spot: UK garage. Let's get this clear: the new Falty DL album is a garage record. Garage. Not techno. Not bass music. It's garage.You can bang on all you want about dubstep, post-dubstep and chilldubwavestep, but just take its lead track Brazil featuring Lily MacKenzie: it's proper UK garage. That's garage. It's a word you won't have seen on a blog for about 46 years.You Stand Uncertain is Planet Mu's most notable release this year so far (although Boxcutter's got some interesting stuff on the way), and it is Mr Falty's follow-up album to his debut platter Love Is A Liability. The big female vocal choons on the album, such as Gospel Of Opal, seem to be a statement. It's Falty pinning up a six-foot banner emblazoned with the phrase I'M BACK.Onto the outside of his garage.There are many tools in his garage, though. Open Space is a good example of the variance on offer here: it lurches from tingling fairy techno to dark, low-hung rave (a tendency even more obviously splashed over the playful Lucky Luciano).And I'm deeply in love with the early-Grid snare clickiness on The Pacifist. He's got that retro feel yet again.You Stand Uncertain is an impressive achievement and, for my money, sets the standard more so than another one of the three records I'm hammering at the moment, namely James Blake's eponymous and ubiquitous debut album.The third one? It's not an electronica record, so I can't mention it. All I can tell you is she has the same name as an invisible rabbit and she sings about England."},
{"title": "Fats does a best man speech", "date": "Apr 1, 2011", "text": "Last week, I got to be best man for a very good friend of mine, The Stef. As part of my duties  (not losing the rings, not losing the groom), I got to make a speech.Here is that speech. I have edited it for my blog readership, which includes  changing or deleting names, crossing out in-jokes that you won't get, cutting  out personal information and slicing out bits that would have made sense in the  room but not on this blog.Fats does a best  man speechI must start by thanking The Stef to allowing me to be best man... When he  asked me to be best man, I'm not ashamed to admit, it made me cry. You now rank  alongside my all-time blubbings, including the day John Peel died, when Jenson  Button won the world championship, and that episode of In The Night Garden when  Makka Pakka didn't tidy the Plinky Plonk and Iggle Piggle lost his blanket.So let's unravel this mystery man. Think back a time long ago. Imagine a  young, eager hip hop fan stuck in the rough end of town, a white rap kid in a  black urban music world, not the best-dressed, not the best haircut, but  passionate. Little did we know he would develop into a multi-platinum hip hop  star.But enough about Vanilla Ice: this is about The Stef. He goes by many names.  Some may know him as his MC name, “Fire Damage”, so-called because like fire  he's overwhelming, noxious and a danger to children.He is also known as The Stef, that's THE Stef just so (and you may need to  help me out here) we don't get him confused with other famous Stefs like...People call out names, such as Steffi Graf, Stephanie Beecham and Stefan  Dennis who played Paul in Neighbours.I first met The Stef when he used to come into my shop to buy CDs. There was  something different about him. Maybe it was his smile, maybe it was his looks,  maybe it was the shell suits. Me and my bookshop colleague took him under our  wing: we took him to gigs, we helped get him a job with us, we became  friends.Basically, grooming.We gained a shared love of partying, particularly the totally non-gay time we  dressed as cowboys then swapped clothes. And music runs through our veins like  White Russians, both of us DJing at a night cafe, The Stef MCing while I  beatmixed breaks a youth club where ten year old gangster kids would come down  and rap lyrics like “iminimimino imibo dibbedydo” and we'd say, yeah man, that's  really deep.Even now, The Stef keeps it real on his Facebook page by posting videos of  DMX, LL Cool J and UB40. That's scrabble scores of 8, 16 and 250  respectively.*We both have a shared love of going to pubs where football or rugby is being  shown. Stef loves watching the game and I love watching The Stef turn an  impressive shade of purple as he yells his lungs out. Apparently he supports  England. And Poland. His ideal country would be a mixture of the two, but that  would be called Pongland, which is stupid.The Stef can be a passionate man. He is one of the few people that can get  into an argument in the street, get punched in the face, and then end up being  his attacker's best mate. If we ever fall out, Stef, remind me to reconcile our  friendship by punching your face off.The Stef's ability to shovel buckets of food down his gob and still maintain  a martial arts physique is legendary. In fact, I have one of his shopping  receipts here.Pulls out massively long receipt that rolls out across the table and  halfway across the floor. Reads: \"Pasta, tuna, crisps, donner meat, chips, pasta, crisps... and a £1.99  ready-meal which is pasta with donner meat sauce and a side serving of  tuna-flavoured crisps.\"When in the middle of a rather strenuous session of mastication, The Stef  cannot talk: instead he chooses to communicate through his eyebrows. An eyebrow  frown means he's thinking of going home to do some washing. One raised eyebrow  indicates he wants a pint of whatever you're drinking. Both raised eyebrows  means he's about to keel over because he's reached his two-pint tolerance  level.The once gave me a keyring.Holds up racing car keyring. A wheel has fallen off. It's a racing car, because we both liked formula one. If you look closely,  you'll notice the wheel's fallen off. It is now a three-wheeled car, it's  essentially a model of a very fast Robin Reliant.And now, every time I watch an F1 race and a car's wheel falls off, and the  driver burns up in a horrendous fire while the tyre bounces into the spectator's  arena and violently crushes a hundred people, I think fondly of The Stef and  this beautiful symbol of our friendship.This day is all about The Stef and his bride, but I have to address something  I know we're all thinking about. That long love affair, pre-[bride], with the  one person that I thought The Stef would be with forever. Of course, I'm talking  about MC Serch.*Let's not forget those intimate nights they spent together, MC Serch blasting  out lyrics to The Stef in his bedroom, and The Stef grabbing his hairbrush and  shouting them back with delicate affection, sweet, sweet lines like:\"Honeydip, and take the squad to the teepee, Hit it off, smoke a cig,  watch a little TV.\"\"When I go pop pop pop, Simon says \"Stop”.\"Start to read third lyric, then realise there are children in the room. It  was going to be a Vanilla Ice lyric, \"ecstasy you don't wanna miss gotta have  it! Animal sex with a twist like a rabbit.\"Then a load of more personal stuff to end the speech, the only bit of  it I want to share being my final visual gag addressed to the bride:You 'get' Stef. You know his strengths, his weaknesses, his charms and his  foibles. Because there's the entertainer Stef, but then there's the deeper Stef  that not so many people get to see. In fact, I've taken the liberty of producing  a pie chart to show Stef's many sides.Pulls out hand-drawn A3 pie chart headed 'The Inner Stef' with several  different coloured pie pieces, one of which has his bride's name, while all the  other bits of pie each contain the word FOOD. Small print at the bottom:  Copyright, the Office Of National Steftistics. Some of the family wasn't so sure  about this bit... but The Stef seemed to approve.* blatantly stolen from my Boy Band Family Tree performance from  December 2010.**The Stef's love of 3rd Bass is well  documented.Speech edited and reprinted with approval of the groom."},
{"title": "The Greenroom must be saved: thoughts from a humble gorilla", "date": "Mar 31, 2011", "text": "The Arts Council England's decision to cut all of its funding to the Greenroom is the equivalent of grabbing Manchester by its hoody and kneeing it in shakermaker.The Greenroom, snuggled beneath railway arches near the Cornerhouse cinema, is an unusual mix of theatre space, studio room, cheerful bar and balcony gig zone-type-area. It is unique even in Manchester and it has seen out Thatcher, Madchester, the Hacienda, the IRA bomb, the Commonwealth Games, D:Percussion, Manchester's noughties retail revival, Anthony 'Mr Manchester' Wilson and Frank Sidebottom.But now, a government intent on an ideological stripping of much that is valuable about Britain has forced the fickle finger of the Arts Council to flick this amazing venue off its books.I spent many hours in the Greenroom helping build its Greenroom United archive site by interviewing friendly punters and artists of all different shapes and colours, from Graham Massey to Lip Service to Franko B. Editing the audio of those chats late into the evening gave me an awesome sense of history about the place.I also became part of an exhibition called We Were Spending Precious Time, in which I gave my own walking tour of Manchester. You can see me featured in the first video on the Precious Time site (that's me at the very start).I played a gorilla at the Cabaret Formerly Known As Bucket, which still rates as one of the greatest performances by any actor, living, dead or future.The Greenroom is part of me in several ways, then. The Financial Times called the cuts a \"surprisingly bloodless affair\". My blood is boiling. I'm going to set Frank B on 'em.This decision stinks of an arts body playing it safe in the extreme. The Greenroom is an awkward, gangly 28-year-old and not the Latest Big Thing. I like awkward, gangly 28-year-olds. The thought that the Greenroom's future may not be so rosy fills me with horror. There is no organisation in Manchester that will take risks with performers on the same scale, with the same support, and with the same acceptance of failure and success as sides of the same coin.The Greenroom's future must be secured. Greenroom director Garfield and his staff face some crucial decisions. One thing is certain: the Greenroom has lots of friends it can call on. The picture at the top of this post is my gorilla character being led by cabaret host Gareth Cutter, and overlayed over that is the name of every artist whose story was told on the occasion of the venue's 25th birthday.There are so many names, you can barely see me emoting gorillaness like the actor that I am.See the full list of people here. See a larger version of the picture on Twitpic.Now get onto the Arts Council and complain.See also: thoughts from The Drunken Chorus; thoughts from Cutteruption.

Manchester scored the most yes results, followed by Newcastle and Nottingham.A PRS spokesperson contends that \"Manchester has always been a hot contender as music capital of the UK,\" and this will no doubt be hailed as a victory by the likes of Now Wave, Islington Mill and so on.However, look at that survey question again: \"I have enough local gigs in my area.”Now imagine you are a city centre resident who has had one too many sleepless nights from revellers kicking bus shelters and screaming in a drunken haze at their partners in the street. How would they answer the question?I reckon they'd think there were enough gigs too.Manchester's response should be as surprising as it is simple. We have enough gigs. Manchester is full up for gigs. No more gigs, please.Let's have a moratorium on live music in Manchester. Just temporary, for about ten years or so. Not a string strummed, not a skin drummed, not a tune hummed. Let a terrifyingly silence descend on this city like an audio shroud.It will be awkward. Musicians will either leave town or get a job with the Co-op. Historians will refer back to this time as the Dead Years, with Market Street buskers slumped by empty hats and clubbers crying into their spliffs in Sankeys.But, my friends, it will be worth it. Think of Liverpool's continual guitar-jangling efforts to escape their Merseybeat past, or Southend's gothic rockers trying to drown out the memory of Procul Harum.In the meantime, Manchester will lie in a holy silence, resting, planning, storing its energy until 2021, when suddenly and without warning, every musician from every corner of this Bezforsaken city will burst into a cacophonous and all-encompassing wall of music that will devastate every other music scene that has ever existed.It's the only way forward for the best music scene in the UK.Just a caveat, though: if we are going to do this, can we wait until I've seen Kylie on Saturday?

Brown's tragic demise struck a strong emotional chord with the public and for weeks following his death, newspapers ran repeated headlines speculating about his Sex Machine theme park, his nine masked children and his relationship with his doctor, Mr Shipman. After he became ill, James Brown sued himself for writing I Feel Good. Jeff Beck & the Jonas Brothers were 63 and are survived by two husbands and six children.John Barry Barry (pictured above) is arguably Britain's greatest living vocalist and shares a passion with people called JB.

But I have four more strings to my bow lyre*.The first string is my umpteenth reading for the Bad Language open mic night at one of Manchester's pubbiest pubs, The Castle on Oldham Street. At past readings, I have imitated Yorkshire men imitating American schoolgirls, talked about the gutting of dead tooth fairies and peeled the text of a story off my reddened chest. What gimmick shall I masquerade as serious literature at the next Bad Language? Come along and see, on Wednesday March 23rd.And while I'm twanging that first string, you'll also find me performing at the Manchester Twestival at NoHo on March 24th. The Manchester Twestival is a localised version of a much bigger global mission to raise cash for charity through social media. I'll be at what's called a 'pop up literary salon', which sounds like a hairdresser made from cardboard but it is not. If you do buy a ticket, you can raise money for the Wood Street Mission too.My second string is coming up very shortly, and that's an art exhibition starting tonight. Surgery of Dreams is an otherwise-respectable composer and musician Michael Mayhew scalpelling out the innards of antique books and replacing their guts with found objects, such as shotgun cardtridges, skulls (check the amazing skull on the website) and, gulp, the cast of a vagina. Which I poked with my finger the other day. Gently. The launch is in my bookshop tonight, it will be hosted by me and you should definitely come. The exhibition runs until April 20th.My third string (hurrah, we have a chord!) is a short story competition I have cobbled together with the original protagonists of the so-called Beatoff Generation. Except now, we are respectable because this is part of the Chorlton Arts Festival. The Flash Mob Writing Competition (see here the Twitter page) is asking for stories of 500 words or less by April 29th, which is otherwise known as That Bloody Royal Wedding Day. All the rules and requirements can be found on our funky red Flash Mob website. This is the Festival's first ever flash fiction competition and all shortlisted entrants will get to read their tales at a special reading and awards night on May 26th with little old me and my chums.My fourth string has somewhat snapped, only because it naturally sounds of sadness and failure. The F1 Losers League is back once again this year. It's a unique competition which flips the usual fantasy league formula to celebration of the stragglers and also-rans in the world's most high-tech sport. The F1 Losers League will close to entries in the early hours of March 26th, at the beginning of qualifying in Australia. So to take part, you need to get your entry in pretty sharp-ish.So then.

{"title": "Hammer time for Fatty Bumchops: how to blog properly", "date": "Mar 6, 2011", "text": "The best developed, most cohesive, and most robust blogging scene in the UK.These were the words, carefully prefixed with 'arguably', scribbled by the Manchester Blog Awards last year. With the next Manchester Blogmeet nearly upon us (this Tuesday!), I thought I'd give a few wibblings about my little corner of the blogging scene in 2011.I find myself in a very different position from this time last year. I always saw myself on the edges of blogging in the same way I played around on the edges of DJing. A few blogmeets and awards later, I'm somewhere near the somewhat crowded centre. Of one of the many centres.What started as a way of plugging my DJing activities became, well, a scene in which I hang out with bloggers (retro gaming the other night), perform with bloggers (at the Bad Language events), get consulted about blogging (websitey people asking for advice) and help other bloggers connect (having a hand in the Manchester Blogmeet, for example).Part of this is graft: I gave up my telly for these paragraph's you're currently smooching with your eyes. Part of this is also my belief that blogging has to be about connection in this proper physical world of real things. It has to make a difference, even if it's just someone in a shed in Preston giving encouragement to a struggling writer sweating it out in a birdhouse in Portsmouth.What I love about Manchester's blogging scene is the rag-tag jumble of blogs of different shapes and sizes: the SEO-heads, the musicistas, the foodies, the hyperlocals, the poets or the whimsical neither-here-nor-theres. And everyone's so busy all of the time. It's a well-developed and professional scene that is strong enough to say to companies wanting to capitalize on our content or ideas: \"thanks for your interest, now give us some money.\"The nice thing about the Manchester Blogmeet is it  brings everyone down the same level and it humanises what is often a  solitary pursuit. I'm not going to spool off a rollcall of recommended blogs here, although this post has inspired me to ditch and re-start my Fat Friends in the right-hand column of this site.What I would say is if you run a blog and you're in Manchester, be encouraged. You're part of a bustling scene of tapped-in letters in darkened rooms, whatever the focus of your blog.I thought I'd finish with some advice. People often ask me about blogging because they think I know stuff. It always goes like this:- Hey Fatso, should I publish my blog in 150 different languages and reduce the text to six-point?- Don't do that. People might not read your blog.- Hey Fats, should I smear my blog page in crusty lobster paste?- Don't do that. People might not read your blog.- Hey Fatty Bumchops, should I ditch the tired old media of computers and fire my blog out of a tube instead?- Yes, definitely do that, then everyone will read your blog.I like being asked, so here are few basic pointers about running a blog the Fat Roland way, concentrating mainly on sins I myself have committed on these very pages.Fat Roland's ten blog tips 1. If you want a wider readership, make your blog about something. I deliberately put 'Electronica' into my title to Ronseal this whole dang operation. I hope I've proved you can be specialist and still be accessible.2. Most of your hits are probably very casual browsers. You want them to stick around, right? Then don't splash eye-pain all over your blog. Start by getting rid of that black background. 3. As for your content, edit, edit, edit. Write a sentence then halve it. Use short paragraphs. Short sentences and not ones that go on so long you've lost track of how the sentence started in the first place because you didn't read my advice about writing a sentence then halving it which is what I just wrote in a previous sentence which, entirely non-ironically, was twice the length before I edited it down unlike this one which has gone one so long you've lost track of how the sentence started in the first place because I didn't read my advice [breathe!] are definitely better than long ones. See?4. Check your facts. Pressing 'publish' and hoping  you're right is not good enough. And reading something on one website is  not fact-checking. Learn to do proper Google research.5. Collaborate. Don't type in a vacuum. Contribute to other people's blogs, leave comments, link generously and meet other bloggers (starting with the blogmeet this Tuesday).6. Post regularly. I've really struggled this past month to keep up with my blogging  and I think my sites have suffered as a result. Set yourself a target and stick to it (mine is 120 posts a year).7. A bit of design wouldn't go amiss. My blog is a pretty recognisable Blogger template, but I've added a bit of extra visual goodness. All of my design, apart from my masthead, is done using Microsoft Paint and a crappy picture editing programme called Piknik. Even a five-year-old sandwich could use those programs. 8. Give up your telly. No, really. If you're watching Corrie when you know you should be blogging, then you have decided that watching Corrie is more important than your blogging. Smash it in with a hammer. The only danger then is, if you are smashing in your television with a hammer instead of blogging, you have decided that smashing things in with hammers is more important than blogging. That is not necessarily a bad thing.9. It's not about the stats. People should be able to find your blog in any way they see how, and if that means parallel Facebook posts and letting people read the full text on Google Reader, both of which I would assume takes away clicks from your actual site itself, then so be it.10. It's only a blog. Lighten up. Jeez. Why are you even reading this? Turn off the computer. Get out. Go for a walk. Let the wind furrow into your brain-hair. You'll be a better blogger producing better content with a mind clear of cobwebs."},

We'll fill your pants with so much trivia, you'll be shaking it out of your trouser ends like the UNCLE guy in the Great Escape.And finally, there's always my F1 Losers League, which I have banged on about before, but which now has an extended entry deadline of March 26th. Visit the website for more.Yes, this blog is meant to be about electronic music. Pfffrt. If you want consistency of content, go and read The Pigeon Post.  I have been a bit shoddy recently, but there'll be more music witterings soon, honest. Meanwhile, here is a list of search terms that haven't resulted in recent hits on my blog:- junglist Richard Madeley- Norwegian wool- a cacophony of roses- the holy trinity of Rudy's Rare Records, Cool Runnings and Rastamouse- Justin Biepbipe- is Fat Roland my real father- turnpike Birmingham rocking chair crew- Norwegian woof - cheap supermarket toothpaste- Venetian Snarls"},

Let me just press restart.Sorry about this. It takes a while to reboot. Full of viruses, this thing.So then. Done anything interesting recently? Oh, here we go. Let me just find the mp3s again.Oh great, it's lost them. Thanks, computer, you galoofing mess of catastrophic circuitry. You've ruined everything. I don't want to listen to the James Blake album now. That would be like listening to the wails of whales speared in a bloody sea. Like the last sighs of a cherubim skewered on a cackling devil's pitchfork.Cocksocks. Kilobytes of James Blake lie dead in my computer, exhausted sonic sperm on the sidelines of my digital tubes."},

At least, not the ones I want. As Glasgow collective Lucky Me tweeted a few days ago, \"Spotify will never pay folks like us because they refuse editorial: they are only sales responsive.\"It's a strange animal, Spotify. The Cynical Musician is right when he asks if Spotify is not a money maker, what is it good for.Putting revenue aside (I'll let proper musicians discuss that), as a music lover, it's about as useful as a chocolate tea cosy. My recent plays on Spotify include Resoe, SBTRKT and Flying Lotus. What is the front page recommending to me at the moment? Bonnie Tyler, Mozart and Coolio's Gangsta's Paradise.It's almost as if Mr and Mrs Spotify in their little green Spotify cottage with their little green Spotify umbrellas took a look at Amazon's cookie-monster recommendations system and thought, \"no, that won't do, that won't do at all. What we want is the equivalent of walking into Starbucks to buy a coffee and being sold wellington boots instead.\"Spotify is good for playlist recommendation, hence my oozing and my bleeping, but when whole record labels are missing from the service because Spotify can't put food on their table - can't even give them a table - then what's the point? Anyway, the Oozy Bleeps will bleep again next month. I will soldier on with Spotify because, I hope, some of you find it useful. The playlist is still up there, and it will be updated throughout the month."},

Abandoned buildings. Unread newspapers. Car alarms punturing the silence of desertion.But screw all that: I've been busy reviving an old project which long-time readers of this blog will recognise.The F1 Losers League is my attempt at a fantasy formula one competition, with the crucial difference that you need to create the worst possible team. So you get points if your cars are slow, unreliable or crashy.I wanted to come up with some F1 / electronica puns so I could shoe horn (car horn?) the league into this blog without making it look like an obvious (spark)plug. But all I've come up with so far is Apex Twin, James Brake and Bargeboards of Canada.The F1 Losers League works like this: you make up a team of four drivers and two constructors. Based on bad performance on and off the track, they earn you points in races and sometimes inbetween races. Everyone pays a fiver and up to seven teams will win cashmoney.I've run this league on-and-off since 2004, so I know those who get the most out of it tend to have at least a passing interest in formula one. It also helps if you have an inner geek because there are ways of manipulating your team throughout the season.Have a look at the league on the F1 Losers website. You need to enter before the zombies come and tear out your heart, or until the second week of March (whichever comes sooner).FLYING LOTUS! The most obvious pun ever! Why didn't I think of that? I always think of good things way too late.Edit: see the comments section below for two more doozies: Saubers of Paradise and Susumu Toyota. Feel free to add your own!"},

There, I said it again.No, I'm not talking about the tongue-busting offspring of plants from the genus Capsicum, members of the nightshade family, Solanasomething-or-other. I'm talking about the wiley shirtless guitar plodders who appear to have gone afro pop.Actually, I'm taking about John Frusciante, who dumped the Chilis in 2007 but has now turned up as one part of Speed Dealer Moms with legendary bass-driller Venetian Snares. This is a live experimental project consisting of those boys, Chris McDonald, a bunch of drum machines (gear, pictured) and, in the band's words, \"many cats\".Their first release is the Speed Dealer Moms EP, a short and bitter chunk of tapping distracto-grooves recorded as-live in 2010 that will frighten Chili poppers but may sound somewhat familiar to Snares followers. While I'm perusing recent tracks (mainly from the end of last year), I've been addicted to Rafferties's Rank Functions EP. The title track is a 2step tech stormer on his own Super label that turned my pants brown, but check those warm chords in His Counting House or the out-and-out house snap of Horse Flesh. Suddenly, I feel Raffertie has \"arrived\" in that really pretentious way some people say \"arrived\".Meanwhile, The Black Dog's latest offering is Subject To Delays. That's not an announcement for tardiness, but rather the name of their latest EP in their Music For Real Airports project which features rolling house and drifting ambience in equal measure.Picture: modified from a Universo Frusciante snap."},
{"title": "Guest post: Crimes against crimes against keyboards", "date": "Jan 26, 2011", "text": "I asked you for your nominations for the worst crimes committed against dance music, from which I picked a random winner. Jon Mann gets a bunch of mp3s and this guest post on Fat Roland On Electronica...I would like to nominate The Black Eyed Peas –….I don’t actually know the name of the track although I should probably find out what it’s called before I start. You probably know the one I’m on about already, something about a good day. It’s probably called ‘a good day’.It’s called ‘I got a feeling’ and it’s good night not day.O.K so I can’t say that I’ve ever sat down to listen to it but I don’t need to, it was so popular when it was released that it became part of the wallpaper that belonged to time and place. That time and place, that thankfully is now behind us.The production is actually not that offensive, it’s a poppy, upbeat, forgettable dance track. The most compelling evidence against it is in its lyrics. I might as well have not written anything here other than the lyrics.Here is a sample which I will now cut and paste from somewhere on interwebs.“go out and smash itlet go o' my guardJump off that sofaLet’s get get up”I’m suddenly impressed at just how throwaway and thoughtless these lyrics really are.“I feel stressed outI wanna let it goLets go way out spaced outand losing all control”That’s enough of that. To counteract any harmful side effects here are a few lines from Etchogon-S by Autechre“…//.-*/,.’];--/’;[;[;===*”Better?My point, if there is one, is that despite the song’s protagonist repeatedly claiming to have ‘the feeling’ the song itself is devoid of ‘the feeling’. Its only purpose is to fill a bit of space somewhere for a few minutes. Actually listening to this sort of stuff is a bit like going on a diet where you eat nothing but tile grout. Will.i.am is very keen on his band having the right image, I read an interview with him in the Metro and he said so himself. This, I imagine is what prompted him to stop making vaguely listenable hip hop and get a sexy female singer that can piss herself at will while on stage. [Citation needed]Dance music, electronic music are famously places where the anonymous artist can thrive, knocking out bass odysseys from a sweaty bedsit in Hackney, only emerging at night for skins and cigs from the all night garage. This is where the real shit is at. I’m not against artists having big personalities at all but for everyone’s sake please try to keep the music real and please keep the drums raw.I suppose ‘I got a feeling’ wasn’t really designed for me. You could say ‘but it’s ok for the feeble minded to shake their limbs at’. Well yes, but we all have to suffer though don’t we? Something really needs to be done about this.Basically we just need to play more Aphex.Everyone, now.This guest post was written by Jon Mann."},

We have a winner, ladies and gentlemen.Jon Mann has won the Crimes Against Keyboards competition. He bags himself Bleep.com's top 100 tracks of 2010, which probably means he'll need to build new shelves in his mp3 player to take all the extra weight.Some fine people didn't win, including Compound Ear who used my logo and said really nice things about my blog and refers to his chosen dance music nemesis as an \"aural holocaust\". But I'm happy Jon won because I like his rant too. It will appear later today as guest post on Fat Roland On Electronica.Jon, who describes himself as 29-years-old and an Aquarius (I'm *so* turning this blog into a dating site) says: \"Just really happy to be the lucky one who got selected for the prize. Just dropping it into itunes now :-) \"I've picked up a couple of these tracks over the course of the year but I'm really looking forward to hearing something good that passed me by in 2010.\"Meanwhile, Bleep's top 100 is available on their site until February 10th. I know you can probably stream or steal a bunch of brilliant tunes from last year, but downloading this lot at 30 pence a track is a pretty impressive one-hit way of downloading the state of dance music today. Like Keanu downloading martial arts in Something's Gotta Give (editor's note: check this is the right film).And no, I wasn't paid to say that. Long-time readers of this site know I'm a sucker MC for all things Warp-related.Watch this space for Jon's winning entry and proof that people who, shock horror, don't have a blog can write blog posts too."},

If you haven't entered already, here's what you need to do:- Decide on dance music's worst moment. It could be an awful band, a novelty hit, an established artist getting it horribly wrong, or a wider trend towards crapdom.- Write about it. Either blog it or email something to dj at fatroland.com. A couple of paragraphs will do, but longer rants are welcome too.- One entrant will be randomly chosen as the winner. The prize will be bleep.com's top 100 tracks of 2010, worth thirty quid or thirty-five euros or fifty bucks. You'll get a voucher code which I have secretly snuggled in my nappy.It really is that easy.FAQsHere is a frequently-asked question list for those not yet swayed to enter.Q. What is an mp3?A. It stands for music plop-plop-plop, which is the sound mp3s make when they load into the mini record players contained within white i-pod headphones.Q. Is Justin Biebpipe in the list of 100 tracks included in the prize?A. Technically no. Although you can re-create the Biebpipe magic by riding a skateboard as you listen. Why not fashion your hair into a bouffanted cowpat? And remember to brush your teeth for that winning Justin smile as you utter the words, \"yeah, I'm the white-boy Usher, so what?\"Q. Can I listen to these songs on the train?A. Many express services have special listening points, in which you plug your CD player into a bucket of cold sandwiches congealed with fake cheese, leaked Stella and the sweat - and other bodily fluids - of a thousand pimply buffet car assistants.Q. What if I don't like the music?A. I've done a survey of my teddy bears and 280% of them liked 104% of the tracks. 28% of them also would vote Conservative, but that's neither here nor there. I'm constantly barraged with people asking for recommendations of the latest hippety-grunge popstep disco classics. There's no better way to super-charge your ears with the high-fat cream of the current crop than getting your hairy mitts on Bleep's top 100. I'm a genuine fan of the site and that's why I'm doing this competition. Q. Why can't think of any bad dance music?A. You have no ears. And no brain. Just write. You may surprise yourself. And if you don't do this, the Venga Boys have won."},

That winner will get Bleep.com's top 100 tracks of 2010, worth £30, plus a priceless mention on my blog when I announce the result.What do you write about?It could be a sin by your favourite synth god* or the most disastrous diversion in dance music**. And yes, I do mean dance music however you interpret it, from Basshunter to Brian Eno, from the Chemical Brothers to Chromeo, from Aphex Twin to Adamski.How do you write it?Post it on your blog. Or if you don't have a blog, email your text to me directly: dj at fatroland.com. Between 50 and 500 words will do. All I ask is your arguments are convincing (even if only in an ironic way) and are non-libellous.Will I read it?Yes, every entry. To ensure your entry gets noticed, include \"Crimes Against Keyboards\" in your title line or near the start of your text. Feel free to publish the above graphic.

The moment the Beatles clanged out seven years worth of jangly pap, it was over before it started.It was revealed yesterday that only three of the top 100 tracks of 2010 in the UK were rock songs, the best-selling of these being Glee's Don't Stop Believing.If you're not aware of the Glee phenomenon, think of Miley Cyrus and Justin Biebpipe doing an ACDC covers tour. Now replace Miley and Justin with a baboon flinging its own excrement, and replace ACDC with every treasured memory you've ever had. That's Glee.It turns out guitars were just a temporary fad. All those bedroom garage bands banging out noisy chords and committing it to four-track in a cousin's shed? It was the musical equivalent of space hoppers, Tab cola and happy slapping.Now HMV have a golden ticket for turning their sales around. Have half their shops sell only neo-rave, breakcore and 8bit Kraftwerk classics, while have the other half contain hundreds of burning Fender Stratocasters, constantly on fire like sick Olympic flames and proffered worshipful sacrifices by a rock-hating public. Here, god of guitar-death, have my collection of coloured Green Day vinyl I just smashed with a hammer, thanks be to Aphex.Truth is, of course, guitars have never been popular. A quick finger through the UK's top ten best selling singles of all time shows all we really care about is Elton John, Boney M and (shudder) Robson And Jerome. The rockiest tracks are by the Beatles, Wings in Kintyre-mode and those bastians of death metal, Frankie Goes To Hollywood.The shroud of lies perpetuating the rock myth has fallen and we can get back to good honest dance music like Black Eyes Peas, Basshunter and Doop.All those annoying acronyms to memorise guitar strings can revert to something sensible like Every Band Goes Dance, Amen Evermore. And we can all have our hair short. And we can wash. With water and everything. We may even use soap. Imagine that.Rock is dead. Long live Jean Michel Jarre's impending Autechre remix album.(Please send letters of complaint to Axl Rose, A Hammock, Backstage At The O2 Arena, Londinium, 1LLU 51ON.)"},

Planet Mu, that UK staple of electronic music, spent over a year tracking down footwork proponent DJ Nate in preparation for this album.Bangs & Works Vol 1 is 25 tracks of bad-talkin' dubstep-influenced dirty Chicago dance music, none of the artists I've heard of, but which brings to mind the evolution of nu skool breaks by Adam Freeland and Burial's more sample-heavy moments.By the way, I lied. I'm not the leading proponent of the Chicago footwork dance style. If I was, the result would be somewhat akin to the punchline to the old joke, \"what do you get if you cross an elephant with a kangaroo\".Another compilation worth its smelling salts is Ghostly International's retrospective We'll Never Stop Living This Way: A Ghostly Primer featuring 11 years of works by artists that have since become bleepists du jour:, including Gold Panda (glitchy and fuzzy), Loscil (floaty and melodic), Matthew Dear (robotic and dark) and Dabrye (laidback and loose).If you get the album, you also get a Ghostly Book, which inevitably will carry a photo taken in the 1840s of someone you saw at the Morrisson's cheese counter last Sunday. That's how ghostly books work. You see someone in the book and then you die or your hair turns white or Jack Nicholson gets all axey on you.Meanwhile, Manchester's greatest fader-strokers have come together for Mind On Fire's debut album proper, Great Minds (aka Mind On Fire 005). The bringers of Fire have been promoting nights in God's great city for six years. although this album feels very much like an opening salvo in the war against bad music.It includes Detroit-smooth beats from XXXY (featured by Fabric before now), G Kut's bhangra-wobble Dance Of The Cuttlefish and Neko Neko's inappropriately-named Fast which takes Plaid's trademark synth sound and smothers it with Boards Of Canada dreaminess. More of the same, please.The photo above is G Kut at the DPercussion festival and is one of a number of excellent photos taken by Flickr user Rufus A.

The winners were Rob Gregg, Ani Smith, Lee Moore, Gareth Cutter and Ian Breen. They'll be getting an exciting handmade disc of some of my favourite choons, each sporting arty scribblings aimed directly at them (pictured above).In other unconnected tweetery, I went pun mad yesterday. Because I've had the phrase \"Selected Ambient Worms\" in my head for months, I started tweeting some Aphex Animals. It caught on and it saw me 'trending' on Twitter alongside other hot Manchester Twitter topics as Emmerdale, MCFC and One Direction's Zayn Malik.Here are the Aphex Animals (hashtag #aphexanimals) that my trusty followers and I came up with.

Not that The Tuss and Aphex Twin are in any way connected, of course. Not at all.)- Analogue Puppybath- Antalord- Black Widow Licker- Cock/Ver10 (which is less of a pun and more of, um, an actual track. A track, incidentally, which I accidentally played in a shop at the Lowry Retail Mall without remembering the rather fruity language halfway through.)- Come On, You Slugs!- Come On You Stags - Come To Tabby- Dodecaheron- Dododecahedron- Dolphium (the one of which I am secretly proudest)- Duckqs- Dukqs- Fenix Skunk 5- Gnu Calx- Hangable Auto Bull- Hart as you mean to go on- I Bear Because You Do - Kangaridoo - Lamalord 10- Laughable Butane Dog- Mike and Ostrich - Milklamb - Monkey Rhubarb - Moth - Next Sheep With- Polynomial Seahorse- Prezambeetle- Reunicorn 2- Richard Bee James Album- Selected Ambient Worms- We Are The Gnu-Sic MakersEdit: Some of these have been added later.

In July last year, I realised that the whole of rock history boiled down to, well, a kettle of fish.So I raved about Eels re-recording the Prodigy's Music For A Jellied Generation, and Professor Brian Carps playing keyboards on D:Bream's Things Can Only Get Battered.My followers and I namechecked Fish from Marrillion, Stingray from The Police, Gill Scott-Watch-Out-For-That-Heron and Mackerel Jazz from the band Hakeless (the ones that had a hit with Cod Is A DJ). And then there were tunes like Future Trout of London's Papua New  Guppy and Underworld's album Dubnobasswithmyheadman (which only works if you  mispronounce 'bass').We debated the merits of real non-punning tracks such as Scooter's How Much Is The Fish, Stump's fish-themed Buffalo, Mr Scruff's Fish and also Red Deer Club's The Sound Of Fish mixes.At one point, I started shouting things like \"Injected with a poissons! We don't need sprat any more\", \"Everybody in the plaice, let's go!\" and \"Salmon haddock go if you think you're shark enough.\" Someone warned that my followers might clam up.

Firstly, there was a woeful lack of decent pre-release information, and it's not as if I have 92,000 press officers on speed dial on my phone, and so I ended up filling in the gaps with records that I would never have otherwise mentioned on my blog.Despite that, I still ended up with endless snippets of data that had to be bashed into the shape of a blog post in such a short timeframe, which gave me my second problem: I couldn't edit or check the veracity of my facts to the standard I would normally try to achieve on this blog.And so, despite what I may have promised on Twitter, I'm not doing an uber-preview for 2011. You'll have to stay tuned to Fat Roland On Electronica if you want to find out the latest from Surgeon, Battles, Luke Abbott, Joker, Instra:mental, Teeel, Flying Lotus, the bloke from Metronomy and, um, David Lynch.I'm not entirely heartless, and I will allow you a wee preview. The first is happening on a radio station that I tend to assume all my readers are too mature or cultured for. Thanks to a top five album by dubstep supergroup Magnetic Man, Adegbenga 'Benga' Adejumo (pictured) and Oliver 'Skream' Jones will join the In New DJs We Trust roster. It makes me wonder what happened to Mag-Man's third leg, Artwork, but it makes Radio 1 at 9pm on every second Thursday worth listening to.Also in January, Planet Mu (or Planet µ if you're being pedantic) will release 14 Tracks From Planet Mu, which will contain four new tracks as well as known favourites from Ikonika (her huge earworm Dckhdbtch), Floating Points and more. If you're wondering how essential this is, think heroin, think oxygen, think Santa hats at office parties. Now think of Santa inhaling heroin fumes using an oxygen tank. Yes, children, Santa's a junkie.Finally, 2011 will be the year in which James Blake (MySpace genre listed as \"dub / grime / melodramatic popular song\") will release his debut album, which everyone will laud as genre-busting and experimental. Blake will steal everyone's fire this year, although if you want a truly modern Prometheus, have a look at what Danny Boyle is up to later in 2011.... google for Underworld and Frankenstein."},

The word 'favourite' is also a misnomer, because the ones at the bottom of the list are pretty crud. Think of this, then, as the Top Not-30 Favourite And Unfavourite Films Of Not-All-2010.I think I'll start at the bottom of the barrel...32 - Robin HoodNever mind Men In Tights. I'd rather this have been Men In Tight Nooses, as Russell Crowe brought as much life to our national crook as a Clannad track. And what was going on with the mysterious Lord Of The Flies kids in the trees? Daylight Robinery.31 - Shrek Forever AfterShrek cannot face up to the distance he has engendered between him and his family, so he is sent into an alternate reality. This is Inception for idiots.30 - NineDaniel Day-Lewis plays a convincing Italian lothario, and Queen Judi of Dench flaps out her pair of lungs in an excellent musical performance. Shame then the songs are as compelling as being stuck inside a cement mixer with Kid Rock.29 - The Other GuysI read today that Will Ferrell is now the most unbankable actor in Hollywood. For every dollar he is paid, the KLF burn a million pounds, or something. Anyway, it's a buddy movie and it's quirky and it made me want to watch Anchorman again. 28 - I Love You Phillip MorrisThis utterly unbelievable true story zips through the plot too quickly to really make me care, but it's still better than you'll think it is after I've described it as Brokeback Mountain meets Shawshank Redemption meets Liar Liar. No really.27 - The GhostYesterday, I ate a lovely ice cream sundae, but just before I finished eating it, I smothered it in steaming cat vomit. And today, I constructed a complicated house of cards, ensuring that the last card I placed was encased in five tonnes of petrified excrement. A solid thriller with an ending that I may, possibly, have issues with.26 - Death At A FuneralChris Rock, Martin Lawrence and Tracy Morgan walk into a bar. You already know the conversation they'd have. This film is like that all the way through. With added HILARIOUS COFFIN JAPERY.25 - Sherlock HolmesRobert Downey Junior.  Robert Downey Junior. Robert Downey Junior. Robert Downey Junior. Robert Downey Junior. Robert Downey Junior. Robert Downey Junior. Robert Downey Junior. And some other people. A truly spirited remake of a tired classic.24 - Cemetery JunctionGervais and Merchant reach for Shane Meadows' sentimentality and deliver one of the strongest British films of the year, although I think I only like it because I am old and crumbly like a well-squeezed cheese.23 - The RoadI stood up at a film lecture thing earlier this year and derided The Road as like driving on a motorway in the rain. I was beaten up and left destitute on the side of the M6, and so I resorted to cannibalism to survive. Fact. Still, despite the lack of emotional pull, it's a strong adaptation of a cracking book.22 - Four LionsAs a piece of art, as a piece of ART, this film is a devastating commentary on noughties society, as a piece of ART. But as a film, I expected more dark thrills from the man who brought us My Wrongs 8245-8249 and 117, Blue Jam and something about cake.21 - Bad Lieutenant: Port Of Call New OrleansI should really hate this. It's a cop film, it's Nicholas \"Nic\" Cage doing kerrrrazy, and it's an entirely unnecessary remake. But it's has been drizzled with Coen Brother magic, or at least, a passable impression of the Coens. Hence the lizards. Yes. Lizards.20 - Hot Tub Time MachineOh screw you, this was good, I tell ya. Yes, I like Miranda and I like Not Going Out and I like Ronnie Corbett. I have cheesy taste in comedy. Worth it for the moment when the film's title is said to camera. I actually clapped in the cinema. Strangest cameo of the year too.19 - Let Me InThe boy was a little less fragile, the girl was a little less strange, and the title was a little more palatable than \"Låt Den Rätte Komma In\". This was still a remake you could get your teeth into though, hur hur, and you'll fang yourself for watching it, hur hur.18 - Up In The AirSixty-seventy-two-hundred times better than Come Fly With Me and twelvety-pi-squared times worse than Airplane, George Clooney walks a fine line between a smug git and a compelling shell of a man. A fine film: maybe one for a DVD watch somewhere over Newfoundland. 17 - The Social NetworkLike.What? You wanted more? *****16 - BuriedA big budget, action-packed thriller played out inside a single box, this was a flawed but enjoyable edge-of-your-seat spark of genius. Think of the first time you saw Falling Down. Now bury Michael Douglas alive and play out a similar kind of film. There. That's Buried.15 - Winter's BoneA hilarious comedy in which a resident of the barren Ozark Mountains gets into all sorts of scrapes with a wayward father, weird neighbours and a zany caper involving a boat and a chainsaw. Best watched between Married With Children and Only Fools And Horses.14 - Youth In Revolt (spoiler alert)Michael Cera appears three times in this list, two of which were in Youth In Revolt. Kind of like Fight Cl-- wait, that's a spoiler. Try again. Kind of like Psyc-- wait, I've done it again. Kind of like... Being John Malkovich but with only two Malkovich-Malkoviches.13 - CyrusSo many comedies have me waiting until winter so I can wee the word \"MEH\" in the snow, but Cyrus' story of a jealous son delivered buckets of punchlines and pathos in equal measure. It's not only the surprise comedy hit of the year, it's a must-see for anyone with a home studio.12 - Crazy HeartSo the guy with the fish lips did the wrestling thing, and now the guy with the White Russians does the country singer thing. And yes, he treats women like objects and yes, I've had a rough night and I hate country music. It may be played for Oscar, but it still pulls the rug from under most films in 2010.11 - The TownBen Affleck churns out a slushy romance story whilst constantly bitching at the success of his peer Matt Damon. Wait a second, that's all wrong. This is a gritty heist movie from inside the raw heart of Boston. What have you done with the real Ben Affleck?!10 - Scott Pilgrim Vs The WorldCUT  TO: Edgar Wright's snappy directing style is pushed to maximum effect  here. CUT TO: It's the best reimagining of a comic book I've seen,  although I'm not really a graphic novel reader. CUT TO: It's laugh after  laugh, it's just a shame when the plot gets in the way. FADE TO BLACK.9 - Ponyo On The CliffEvery bit as visually thrilling as Avatar (my thoughts on James Cameron here), Ponyo was a mesmerising, watery animation that was as weird as it was a political commentary. Think of Andrew Marr dressed as a fish. That's nothing to do with this film. just think of Andrew Marr dressed as a fish. There. Nice, isn't it?8 - A Single ManA grieving man plans his death whilst surrounded by the most beautiful actors and the most beautiful film set and the most beautiful acting you have ever seen. You'd think Colin Firth would be grateful, but no, it's all me, me, me. Don't get arsey, Darcy.7 - PreciousIf I said this was a film starring Jonathan King and brought to you by Pat Robertson, you'd not be interested. If I said this was a film starring Westlife and brought to you by the cast of High School Musical, you'd ignore it. Good job then this brilliant film stars Mariah Carey and was brought to you by Oprah.6 - A ProphetThings I don't intend getting locked in a room with: showering prisoners; an advice-dispensing apparition; a deceased deer; a prison 'don'; warring religious types; and definitely, definitely not a prophet with a razor.5 - The Girl With The Dragon TattooThis film looks, sounds and smells great, and it produced the best heroin(e) of 2010 in the form of Lisbeth, the female with the mythical markings. I'm going to don my bike helmet and start hacking my computer immediately gh^(78WIO8--ggG2#p dammit, this is harder than it looks.4 - Kick AssLook at the badger! This is a tremendously entertaining film that --  look at the badger! -- doesn't necessarily mean anything but -- look at  the badger! -- packs so much punch per pound, I don't think I've been as easily entertained by anything else for a long time... ooo, look, a badger. 3 - Toy Story 3A dog, a dinosaur, a donkey, a pig, two potatoes, a cowboy, a cowgirl and a Buzz Lightyear walk into an incinerator, and then... no, I'm not going to say. It's a scene that evoked tears and applause across the country and rightly turned the third Toy Story instalment into something much greater than its (warning, choking hazard, may contain small) parts.2 - InceptionJack from the Titanic dives into some fat orchestral chords and goes on a skiing trip to a dilapidated Venice whilst a girl who can't draw mazes folds up reality so she can fit it neatly inside a pocket inside a pocket inside a pocket. The end.1 - Another YearMike Leigh and Ruth Sheen would be enough to get me watching this film (I'm a sucker for Leigh), but when you throw in Jim Broadbent and Imelda Staunton and THEN have the entire ripped heart of this masterpiece carried on the shoulders of Lesley Manville's tragi-comic turn, you have a meditation on ageing that nudges perfection. It looks exquisite, it twangs your funny bone as well as tickes your heart strings, and it has more to say than half the top ten put together. A true, deadpan, slightly-wrinkled British classic.

To read last year's top ten best electronica albums, click here. 1 - Mount Kimbie – Crooks And LoversMount Kimbie have been a fundamental element of the journey of dubstep over the past few years, but while the purists were polishing their wobbly basslines and pressing thinly sliced beats, MK were busy widdling in the sink and toking on any old influence they could find.2009's Maybes EP was their first big airhorn in the face of the music industry, all taut summer guitars, plunging beats and r'n'b vocals. The duo dipped from some people's attentions when their second EP Sketch On Glass was released, but by then they were shining lights in a scene that encompassed the likes of Martyn, Burial, Joy Orbison and Bibio.And so it came to pass that Crooks And Lovers was one of the most anticipated albums of 2010, and I really don't think anyone quite knew what to expect. They were hailed as post-dubstep and their music spouted the language of ambience, house, glitch, post-rock, techno and hip hop.The album opens with a gliding guitar mantra that quickly descends into the first real rhythm hit of Would Know, its slow wooden beats underpinning epic filter drops that spin your brain 720 degrees. A discordant three-chord theme adds sadness to a Hudson Mohawke-like jam for Before I Move Off, then we're moved into acid techno and minimal click-house territory - but not without being licked in the face by the fret-scraping guitar melancholia of Adriatic in the middle of it all.Ode To Bear could be a Flying Lotus track, but before you start mentally noting comparisons, you're blasted by Field's proper rock guitar (played rather badly, it has to be said). Mayor is some kind of manic toytown rave stripped down to the barest of beats - then before you know it, it's over. Mount Kimbie have pissed in your post-dubstep sink and they're halfway down the road, their pockets bulging with most of the contents of your booze cupboard.To understand why Mount Kimbie is my number one electronica album of 2010, you need a smidgen of context. For years now, I've been banging on about Warp Records this and Warp Records that, harking back to a time when phrases like \"IDM\" and \"warehouse techno\" meant something.Meanwhile, the music scene changed around me. Some crusty danceheads got guitars out or started moving Beyonce to the front of their record collection, and the electronic world became a lot more eclectic. Someone somewhere invented \"folktronica\". This new freedom allowed the likes of Bibio to get away with pastoral, emotive real instruments disguised as proper techno, or the likes of Burial to wedge proper MOBO vocal slices into his work.I fought against it. If I saw a guitarist, I would regularly break his or her fingers. If I heard an album with vocals, I'd chuck it in my Hasbro woodchipper. But then Clark (last year's best album) started using vocals, as did Bullion. Matthew Dear made guitars, like, totally lake superior, as did Battles. Crikes. Then there was the moment when Mount Kimbie's Maybes came out and the penny in my brain dropped with a pleasant clang.The Mount Kimbie sound, all those clanks and thuds and strums you can hear on Crooks And Lovers, went on to define much of this year. With that album, Hotflush Recordings hit the stratosphere, already rocket-powered from the likes of Search And Destroy, Untold and Joy Orbison.And most crucially of all, it laid the eggs that would hatch two words that look set to define 2011:James Blake.Blakey's CMYK is undoubtedly the tune of 2010: its flurry of mixed up vocals (\"found her... red coat\"), fast-step garage and bubbling atmospherics sounded like it either came from deep within the earth or from another galaxy altogether. What's annoying about James Blake is his failure to produce an album this year (it may well have featured in my top ten), but the anticipation of that record (February 2011!) has set musos, journos and fashionistas equally ablaze with excrement-- I mean, excitement.James Blake would not exist without Mount Kimbie. Well. I don't mean literally. Kai and Dom from Mount Kimbie didn't give birth to James. Well... they may have done, but it's not mentioned on discogs.com. If you're reading, boys, you may want to clear this one up in the comments section.And so, there we have Mount Kimbie's place in history, their moment defined, their ouvre, um, ouved. It's a sound that has weedled its way into the eardrums and quietly nags at 2011 to come up with something better. MK's rise to success has been rapid: two EPs and suddenly they're my album of the year - which, may I remind you, is much more vital and era-defining than any Mercury, Grammy or swimming certificate. Thank you for joining me for my top ten albums of 2010. Buy Mount Kimbie's Crooks And Lovers from Bleep or Boomkat or Piccadilly and stay chooned for my round-up of this year's best films, and then my spectacular uber-preview of 2011, which I will slam onto this blog just as that Auld Lang Syne hangover's kicking in.This is part four.

Please do read the other parts of this blog post: part one, part two and part four To read last year's top ten best electronica albums, click here. 4 - Four Tet – There Is Love In YouKieren Hebdon's strongest album had 2010 skipping to the dancefloor while it was still in short trousers. It is probably the only album in my list that has nudged the top 40, a deserved success after he lit the Burial touchpaper with the Moth / Wolf Cub 12-inch last year. In the modern parlance of today's youth, this album is definitely double-rainbow.I had been lazy writing off Four Tet as coffee table electronica for people too afraid of Venetian Snares. There Is Love In You is sardine-full of outstanding tracks (the fractured vocals of Angel Echoes, the soaring simplicity of Circling, the thundering energy of Plastic People), but it works best an emotional journey start to finish, especially when topped with heartbreaking Bibio-like finisher She Just Likes To Fight.A ten-out-of-ten for Four Tet. Buy There Is Love In You from Bleep or Boomkat or Piccadilly. 3 - Luke Abbott – Holkham DronesIs it really four years since Luke's stupendous 8-bit single b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b? Holkham Drones is Abbott's first album and appears to be named after a posh place in Norfolk. Even though it appears to be the Border Community label's only album release of 2010, it arrived on the electronica scene with less of a fanfare, more of an enthusiastic trumpet fart (check my own fartings here).Holkham Drones needs to be rediscovered immediately. Taking its cue from basic frequency modulation, the cymbals hiss and the bass rings hollow and the whole thing appears as if it may fall over any second. But as the beat grabs you by the badgers, your mind is transported into a grey fluffy analogue world belonging to Boards Of Canada and Cluster (the band not the cereal). This meditation on ambience through repetitive beats is the greatest noise since early days of techno, or since I knocked on Timmy Mallett's door for a solid week because he owed me a fiver.The best Abbott since, um, Diane Abbott. Buy Holkham Drones from Bleep or Boomkat.2 - Gonjasufi – A Sufi And A KillerA Sufi And A Killer sounds like Mark E Smith, Timothy Leary, Seasick Steve, George Clinton, Marc Bolan and Flying Lotus using their teeth, yellowed from chewing tobacco, to rip open time itself, then having a jolly good toke on apple tobacco in a shisha cafe. This is a debut album, don't forget. Despite its dizzying array of influences, this is as complete a sound as you're ever going to get.\"You came with weapons: I came with God,\" says Sumach, and you don't doubt him. The billion or so tracks on the album buzz with a shamanic intensity: the eastern impact of Kowboyz And Indians, the vintage jam of She Gone or the imposing beats underpinning his fragile vocals (an ancient Method Man?) on Ancestors. I don't know where he's coming from or where he's going to, but Sufi, so good. Sorry.An incredible achievement for Warp and Gaslamp Killer and the rest. Buy Gonjasufi's Sufi And A Killer from Bleep or Boomkat or Piccadilly.Not quite in the top ten (part three)My top ten is chock full of artists who have embraced the 4/4 rhythm, something which I wouldn't have done a year ago. And so it's a shame to lose Lone, whose Emerald fantasy Tracks evoked the spirit of classic Detroit. Shame to lose Underworld's Barking too. Matthew Dear's Black City didn't dance its way into the top ten either.The Chemical Brothers got back to techno basics on Further, but it wasn't enough, while One Life Stand from Hot Chip was quite good but, frankly, a bit annoying. iTAL tEK's detailed Midnight Colour was definitely in my top half of the long list, while Susumu Yokota's Kaleidoscope didn't see its way into the final reckoning.Dan Le Sac, Teebs, The Orb and Kode 9 (he did a DJ Kicks) also didn't make the cut. I was disappointed with Skream's chart-baiting Outside The Box. He needs to start thinking outside the, um, yeah, anyway. Royksopp's Senior had early retirement in the reckoning for this list.And finally, some artists were excluded because they were probably too guitar-y and not electronica enough,. They include Denis Jones' Red + Yellow = (you must see him live), the Klaxons' Surfing The Void (and yes it was a good album cover) and the electrifying Nerve Up from Lonelady.This is part three.

That and his beats are well phat.So, among the laidback hip hop of Zodiac Shit, the shuffling funk of Dance Of The Pseudo and the swirling headnodding of MmmHmm, we have a multitude of influences: jazz, garage, hip hop, techno, classical, folktronica and Enrique Iglesias. Despite all of this, I can't help feeling Cosmogramma is an album none of us can quite understand yet and perhaps it should be enjoyed more some time in the distant future, maybe in a smokey jazz club in space.FlyLo isn't just a comedy airline created by Matt Lucas and David Walliams. Buy Cosmogramma at Bleep or Boomkat or Piccadilly.6 - Autechre – OverstepsThe Wills and Kate of Manchester electronic music produced three records in 2010. 3 Telepathics Meh In-Sect Connection was a banana-themed collaboration by Sean from Autechre, Move Of Ten was technically an EP (although it's longer than the Flying Lotus album, above), while the release featured in my top ten, Oversteps, gave notoriety to Altered:Carbon who dressed their own LP as Autechre.Listening to Oversteps is a bit like cuddling up to your favourite hedgehog: it's sharp and awkward, yet you're allured by the familiar scent. I don't get the detractors who write this off as difficult. known(1) has harpsichord, qplay is as delicate as my tummy after a night on the rohypnol, whilst see on see and Treale (oh NOW they use capital letters) are bonafide Autechre hits. Kind of. Warmer than Quaristice, this is music that spikes the bloodstream.Buy Autechre's Oversteps at Bleep or Boomkat or Piccadilly.5 - Pantha Du Prince - Black NoiseArriving on Rough Trade Records like a supercharged Sosumu Yokota, Pantha Du Prince produced eleven minimal techno masterpieces that were so fluid, so organic, they could only have been harvested as they were literally dripping from the trees. Minimal techno often bores me, so why on earth is this several leagues above places six to ten on my list?Maybe it's the snarling acid on Behind The Stars, the heavenly rave chords of Satellite Snyper, or the clanks and bells and feedback and heavenly choirs of synthdom that eddy and whirl around crisp beats that couldn't beat more crisply even if accompanied by a Walkers advert starring Gary Lineker being thumped to a pulp by sixteen heavily-armed packets of Seabrook. I'm not sure if Black Noise can be topped, but there are four albums on my list that have done just that. Stay tuned.Bring the Noise: buy Pantha Du Prince's album from Bleep or Boomkat or Piccadilly. Not quite in the top ten (part two)I'm pleased with my top ten, although excluding any amazing album is a bit like shepherding your ten favourite sheep into the pen then shotgunning the rest into blasted pulps of smoking mutton. Here are more lambs that have been silenced.Gold Panda's glitchy Lucky Shiner (pictured) probably got bumped because a couple of artists in my top ten are doing similar things. Massive Attack's Heligoland probably got bumped because, although the album was an improvement, it still sounded like veterans keeping the life support going. Also on a mainstream tip, I never quite connected with LCD Soundsystem's swansong This Is Happening.A notable omission from my top ten is Squarepusher's Schobaleader One project, but I couldn't separate how he could make some tracks on d'Demonstrator sound like Royksopp and then not expect to be compared to Royksopp. He's excluded because he sounds like Royksopp. There, I said it. Squarepusher sounds like Royksopp. Royksopp's funnier the more you say it.Actress' Splazsh is an essential album for 2010, and I feel pained to exclude it. Oneohtrix Point Never received major acclaim for Returnal and again was a close call. And Starkey's Ear Drums And Black Holes, bringing ballads and grime to Planet Mu Records, also just missed the cut.This is part two.

Clark, the recipient of my Best Album Of 2010, then went on to master his debut album Nothing Else. You know it because every city in the UK has been plastered top to bottom with stickers promoting the record. In the process, the Brainfeeder sound (crunchy cut-paste J Dilla beats) was quickly  knocked several days left of Tuesday with the label's first signing  outside of Los Angeles.It was also Brainfeeder's second album proper, and with Lorn quoting Milton all about the place, you knew it would be something special. Before now, I have praised his testosterone retro and made comparisons to Animal Farm and Bladerunner. The album sounds like Knight Rider having a breakdown: maybe it takes itself too seriously, but Nothing Else soaks you like tears and rain with a sound defined by no-one else but Lorn.Embrace the synth melancholy. Buy Lorn's Nothing else from Bleep or Boomkat or Piccadilly.9 - Venetian Snares - My So-Called LifeLike a naughty boy, Aaron Funk ventured away from his natural home at Planet Mu and set up Timesig Records for the (arguably) 22nd studio album from his interior decor / percussion-inspired moniker. Because it was recorded quickly - Snares sees this more of a diary entry than a year's work - My So-Called Life shifted the game somewhat. Well. Slightly. Its still a (detri)mentalist cavalcade of dirty junglism.The quick recording process lightened the music by precisely nought-point-seven degrees: for example, pastoral string-picking gives way to a beautifully melodic 8bit 'n' bass on title track My So Called Life. But it's the vocal samples that are leaned on more heavily than usual here - and what horrible vocals. Grossly non-PC Welfare Wednesday contains a hilarious jibe at Planet Mu label boss Mike Paradinas, while Who Wants Cake? and Posers And Camera Phones say things that would make Jerry Sadowitz blush.The most accessible and disgusting Venetian Snares album for a while. Buy it from Bleep or Boomkat or Piccadilly.8 - Caribou – SwimCaribou doesn't need any more praise heaped on his handsome locks. Resident Advisor has already pronounced Swim as the album of the year (please don't look at that list too much: mine is horribly and coincidentally similar). And Sun's dizzying refrain (\"sun, sun, sun, sun...\") loomed heavily over 2010.I have an entirely personal reason for including Swim here. Opening track Odessa was playing in the bar in which I was getting drunk after my blog awards win, and it kind of became my soundtrack. That's not to downplay the rest of the LP though: crisp, driving house music, chiming hypnotica on Bowls and a nod towards indie pop on Kaili. But really, it's all about Odessa and it's all about the Sun. Sun. Sun. Sun. Dammit, there I go again.Hunt yourself a Caribou: buy Swim from Bleep or Boomkat or Piccadilly.Not quite in the top ten (part one)I will not pretend my list - or indeed any element of my blog - is comprehensive. I also don't think this has been a classic year for electronica, nor that all of these artists are electronica. Crikes. This is like a minefield. Anyhoo, here are some of the albums that didn't pass muster. I'm astonished at how commercial some of my top ten is this year, although Magnetic Man's eponymous debut album pushed the pop too far to be included, despite MAD and despite it being one of the most important electronic music collaborations of recent times. The same goes for Plastic Beach by the Gorillaz, although that was still a glorious album.Daft Punk's Tron Legacy soundtrack came very close; maybe it would have helped if I'd bothered seeing the film. I found Darkstar's slow mosh-hopping North difficult to love, while Salem's King Knight didn't tug the earstrings enough for a top placing. Meanwhile, UNKLE bored me to sleep with Where Did The Night Fall.I was gutted not to include two albums at the opposite end of the electronic sonic spectrum: Ikonika's gamer-baiting Contact Want Love Hate and Brian Eno / Jon Hopkins' Small Craft On A Milk Sea (which is not a great ambient album: it is a great techno album). Any top ten without them would be a crime. It's a fair cop, guv.This is part one.

{"title": "Fat Roland's Christmas message", "date": "Dec 25, 2010", "text": "As that annual torrent of reindeer excrement suffocates our financial stability and any remnants of family happiness, let me wish you one and all a devastatingly happy yuletide.Even if the three wise men weren't smashed on ketamine and listening to breakcore on their journey to Bethlehem, I still think Christmas is a pretty interesting time.It's ecologically interesting because everyone starts pimping their own personal trees with shiny plastic crap, as if trees weren't pretty enough already.It's a true family time because thousands of people worship a new born baby by spending entire days gorging and spending money, when normally they'd pay lip service to new parents with a half-cocked \"oh isn't your baby pretty\" whilst secretly comparing the nipper to a sack of potatoes.And it's a wonderful time for music, what with Simon Cowell personally escorting the Archangel Gabriel by gunpoint to buy the new CD by The Powerpuff Boys / Tammy Teenporn / Insert Generic X Factor Winner.Who am I kidding? If life is an elixir to be drunk, Christmas is a slopbucket steaming next to an overflowing drain. The seasonal tackiness I can cope with, but it seems if you are without family or friends or money, yuletide is a time of sadness, of loneliness and of gnawing off your own legs in boredom.And then, even if you do get to hobble to church without breaking your face on the snow, Christmas doesn't even do religion right: the image of Jesus as a baby does much less for me than the revolutionary aspect of the biblical stories. Babies are rubbish at turning over tables in temples, rubbish, I tell you. I know because I've carried out experiments.So please, switch the telly off, put the turkey in the dustbin, and let's all sit in silence and not enjoy ourselves. If we blink really fast and pretend we're in a club with strobes, Christmas will be over before we know it.(While you're doing that, I will be spending the day getting fat and merry with friends. I love Christmas just for that, although don't tell anyone because it would undermine the essential grouchiness of this blog post.)2010 was a year of collosal highs and lows. I was hospitalised when my internal organs went on strike and I still see the scars everytime I catch my reflection in people's windows on my daily morning streak. But I also won accolade for my blog, which seems to have shifted my creative life several degrees in an unusual and exciting direction.In the dying embers of the year, it's all about to flare up in Fatro Land. I need to tell you about my top ten best 2010 electronica albums (see last year's waffling here), and also my favourite films (again, here's last year's). And then, one of the annual highlights of Fat Roland On Electronica, my stupendous preview of the upcoming year in electronic music (here's last year's).None of it is written yet, but I have to get it done. Good job I'll be spending all day writing instead of getting fat and merry with-- oh, wait. Damn you, Christmas, you've foiled me again..."},
{"title": "Flying Lotus, the Grammys and the genitalia of Equus africanus asinus", "date": "Dec 18, 2010", "text": "Twitter spats are not the de rigueur footwear accessory for the microblogging generation, but are what happens when tweeters lose it with each other.Whether it's David Cameron and the Smiths or Mark Thomas wanting to kick the fluff out of a allegedly corrupt alleged journalist, fights on Twitter are extra entertaining because its not just the school playground gawping in on the action: the whole world is watching and there is no teacher to break it up.I missed this one completely, though. The Grammys announced their usual brown wash of inanity earlier this month. Their nominations are usually as cutting edge as Westlife using a cardigan to slice into Peter Andre's brain. Flying Lotus (pictured), though, wasn't going to take his lack of nomination lying down, and here's what he tweeted on December 2nd:- \"BT, Chemical Brothers, Groove Armada??? are you serious??Grammys are a joke. FUCK YOU.\" (Original tweet here.)And then, just in case his message wasn't heard, he followed it up with:- \"FUCK YOU\" (Link.)- \"You are jokes\" (Link.)And then he got his sass on because, y'know, this is Flying Lotus and he's one hard-ass muddyfunster.- \"PussyAssNotknowingShitaboutREALmusicBitchMadeMotherfuckers\" (link) which sounds like a Prince album.- \"you better hope I don't get a ticket to the party bitch\" (Link.)- \"suck a donkey dick\" (Link.) Two words: Shrek porn.Remember. This is one of the world's most highly respected producers with a penchant for J Dilla beat devastation and the occasional freejazz cigarette. - \"I know the people got me. The real heads got me. They won't catch me in a dress or a fucking afro. Fuck you pop ass pussies\" (Link.)Which probably resulted in a humble letter of apology to Gaslamp Killer, the turntablist who releases beats on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder record label and has been known to sport impressive hair explosions from time to time.I wouldn't dream of attacking anyone on Twitter, so I dribbled in jealous glee at FlyLo's boldness. And he is right. The Grammys are awful... and I wouldn't want to catch him in a dress either. Unless it's a Wednesday night when it's knob-tweakers' tranny night at my place.Good job Mr Lotus made it up to the Grammys the following day, with this heartfelt apology and the cherry on top of this Twitspat pie:- \"I was drunk last night. My bad. You still suck though. BIGBANGATTACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" (Link.)As for the actual Grammy awards, here's a picture of Tom Baker holding a puppy. Forgotten about the Grammys yet? Good. I'm working on a cover version of a St Winifred's School Choir classic and rewording the chorus \"Grammy, we hate you\"."},

Their record label of 2010 is Numbers, a Glasgow outfit whose mission to \"melt together the seemingly disparate  sounds of R&B, techno, electro, house, dubstep, UKF and 80s funk  under one glorious groove\" was lauded by Bleep. The imprint's output this year included Deadboy, Untold and SBTRKT.Because they're well chuffed and that with such high praise, Numbers have launched a compilation featuring every bit out output on their label along with a couple of new t-shirt designs.Over the next few days, expect more 2010 from Bleep in the form of best albums, favourite EPs and most recommended reissues and compilations.

It didn't go squeak: it was more of a yelp and it gave me the horrors when it came to treading the boards.So when I did my comedy lecture Gospel According To Aphex Twin earlier this year at Bright Club, I was still recovering from the stage fright and I shook like a leaf. It did squeak quite pleasingly, though. It looked serene on the surface, but believe me, my inner swan was like a firework with tourettes.My confidence has grown. Since I did a Titanic and garnered way more praise than I thought I deserved at the Manchester Blog Awards, giving me that useful tag of \"award-winning\" to wave in people's startled faces, my squeaks have increased in frequency to a sort of high-pitched jabber.On Wednesday, this accumulated in me reading a short story at an open mic session for the first time in my life. It was for the launch of an anthology by Bad Language (I hope to nudge myself a page or two in the next one) and I read a story called Sandra Sue about teenage ultraviolence.I must say a massive thanks to Socrates Adams for his advice before the event (read something funny, read it slowly). That man is to literary readings what ducks are to deviant sexual practices, and I mean that in a good way.Because of a mixture of extensive preparation, confidence in my material and sheer bloody mindedness, it went down really well. I wanted it to be a performance rather than someone just muttering into a mic (note the pretentious italics), and I was pleased with what I achieved.I then went mad. \"I know,\" I thought, \"I can do this twice in one week.\" I found myself reading for a second time on Saturday at Waterstone's Deansgate branch in Manchester, this time with a weird horror tale The People Vs The Tooth Fairies and a comedy piece about Beyonce.And that's it. I have the lit-reading bug. Hundreds, if not, millions of plans are afoot thanks to my Beatoff Generation chums. We've had a lovely mention in Bournemouth Runner's The Art Of Fiction, we've got fridge magnets thanks to Benjamin Judge and people keep calling me a scenester.\"Scenester.\" Arf.Because of the prep for this week's readings and a nasty little throat / eyes / braincells gremlin that has laid me flat tonight (I can't look at this screen for much longer), this blog has suffered slightly. Less of the usual James Blunt-bashing and more new poked beasties that have little to do with the musical side of Fat Roland On Electronica.Be patient with me, dear reader: I need to keep poking things with sticks. An arrogant bit of me feels that anything is possible right now, especially if I put the work in. This is, after all, the month in which David Lynch (THE David Lynch) released a dance track.

The date they appended, \"12 march 2011\" fed right into the chatter about a new Aphex LP that's been rife on the internet for some time.I showed the video on this blog a week ago and liberally slapped my greasy cynicism over any thoughts that it may be a date for a new album, saying \"it's an advert for his appearance at the 2011 Bloc Weekender festival.  CRASH! That's the rollercoaster falling off the tracks and landing on  the candy floss stall.\"That roller coaster bit might need some explanation. Go and read the whole post here.

Words are our blood cells. Pages are our imaginations and pens are, well, they're just pens, really. We are the sycophantic courtiers of narrative: our protagonists are our emperors and we bow down with short stories, nascent novels, cultural reviews, blog projects, stage readings and inane tweets.Blackwell's in Manchester, Waterstone's on Deansgate, our future books shall bleed from your shelves like a hardback elixir reddened from an embarrassment of grammatical riches. Until then, all we can humbly offer is this manifesto for our future massive greatness.All literary movements are over. Apart from this one, because this is the one we made up when sozzled in Common last night.Ah, yes, the real reason...When numerous writers spilled out of the blog awards a month ago, some of us began writing for each other's websites, or at least upped the ante slightly. 330 Words doubled its number of scribblings, a few got stuck into Write In For Writing's Sake, while others bombarded Do A Barrel Roll then Screen150 with their Barry Normanisms. New friendships blosssomed. Collaborations abounded. Babies were made. Wait. Not that last one. It brought to mind the giggles and inspiration of the much-missed reading night No Point In Not Being Friends, and the Offbeat Generation literary scene mostly consisting of people who know people who know people we know. And for one intense moment, we dallied with the idea of our own literary scene.We laughed like insane, dribbling hyenas at thought of taking on such a self-referential and masturbatory label.So we did it. We are the Beatoff Generation. You are the Beatoff Generation. We'll be inclusive, we'll be positive, we'll publish each others' stuff. We are beatoff, you are beatoff, everyone who snuggles our words in the warmth of a website, in the past or at any point in the future, you are, we are, they are beatoff.To mention names would be reductive, so there's no way I'll talk about Bad Language, B&N Magazine, Fell House, I Thought I Told You To Wait In The Car, Pantheon, Roy Keane's Lucky Scarf, Voices From The Below, Who The Fudge Is Benjamin Judge, Words & Fixtures, the many blog awarders, everyone I couldn't fit into one blog post - or the poor souls that simply humour us when we're coming up with stupid #beatoff ideas.Maybe using \"beatoff\" as a hash or blog tag will help us coalesce, or give us that little nudge when wrestling with word counts, or maybe it'll become a magazine or a blog or a book to disgust those perturbed by its sordid name. Maybe it will become something massive, even though none of us are at all serious about any kind of a 'scene'.Or maybe we truly are \"forever doomed as the literary scene that gave itself the worst name ever\".  When you next see Jupiter glowering beside the cheerful moon, think of it as the dot in the i of Beatoff Generation, the imaginary letters spanning the night sky like colossal typeface balloons. Climb onto your roof and sing to the letters, like a wordsmith wolf howling under the weight of literary history. And then hit 'publish' and see what happens."},

See the update on Aphex Twin here. Like a ricketty rollercoaster at a termite-infested fairground, we're back round the Aphex Twin speculation loop and, quite frankly, the seatbelt's digging into my ribs.As I revealed on Fat Roland's Oozy Bleeps yesterday, electronic music site Hyponik blurted out a teaser video designed to sign people up to its mailing list. It was entitled AFX Seaside Specials From Aphex Twin and was a mass of promenade camera footage, decaying film reel and that trademark Aphex grin. This was all set to an Aphexian dense drum-and-bass track.The longer downloaded video (see above) ended with a date that clanged massive bells with every Aphex fan, as if Hellboy was taking out his frustration on a test-your-strength machine inside your eardrum. \"12 March 2011\", said the date. CLANG! It's a new album! CLANG! It sounds like Aphex Twin! CLANG! It looks like Aphex Twin! CLANG! It's a new album from Aphex Twin! CLAAAANG!The truth is as disappointing as a house of horrors with crying middle aged men in white sheets going woooh as armless plastic skeletons lean awkwardly in damp plywood coffins. Aphex Twin's March 2011 Seaside Specials album does not exist. There, I've said it. That's another notch on my google ranking for \"Aphex Twin's new album does not exist\".The track in the video is not an Aphex Twin tune. It's by dgoHn (pronounce it as a harder \"John\"), an artist played live by the 'Twinned one before being signed to the Rephlex Records label. It's a 2005 tune called Vase and you can stream it here. The one in the Aphex Twin video is slightly different (the cut-out before the beat drops in the video, the voices on the original), so it's prob'lee an excerpt from a live DJ set, a remix, or both.Which leads me to the reason for the video's existence in the first place: it's an advert for his appearance at the 2011 Bloc Weekender festival. CRASH! That's the rollercoaster falling off the tracks and landing on the candy floss stall. Let's sift through the bloodied sugar puffballs for evidence, shall we?1. The video makes a reference to seasides. The Bloc Weekender is at Butlins in Minehead.2. The video makes a reference to 12th March next year. This is when Bloc will take place.3. Aphex Twin has played this electronic-music-friendly event before, and even played dgoHn's Vase in his set in 2009. (At the 99 minute mark, if the comments here are to be believed.) I would love to hear a recording of that bit of the set...4. The video contains exactly the kind of visuals Aphex Twin uses in his live set (see more about this at Brainchops' excellent blog post). 5. This was posted by Bloc on their Facebook page as an obvious teaser about their 2011 line-up.6. The internet loves Aphex speculation, whether it's his new album, or The Tuss, or his new album, or his new album, well, mostly it's his new album. So what are we left with? A mangled wreck of carriages, candy floss and carnival folk and no more clues as to the whereabouts of Aphex Twin's latest release. We're on the edge of Blackpool's north pier in the bitter wind and sea spray with no-one to guide us other than hardened half-naked pensioners in sagging deckchairs.Let's hold on to the fact that Bloc 2011 looks proper smart, dgoHn is flipping good and Hyponik deserve lots of people on their mailing list. Meanwhile, if Aphex Twin doesn't get his shizzle together soon, I'm blowing this theme park sky high."},

His desk drawers are crammed with material and it's only a matter of time before it all blows away uselessly into the ocean, lost to the fishes for all eternity.Maybe he can't stop writing tracks, or more importantly, he can't finish the one's he's started. Maybe the curse of the Aphex Twin Comeback is too much to bear and when he finally releases an album, it will just be the sound of him crying into a supersize tub of Ben And Jerry's.Since Aphex Twin's last long player proper, Drukqs, Venetian Snares has churned out fourteen albums. We've waited such a long time for this new 'phex LP, it led me to speculate that yes, Aphex Twin's album doesn't exist in February 2009, that no, in fact Aphex Twin's album absolutely does exist in March 2009, or hold on, Aphex Twin's new album may or may not exist in December 2009, or sack it, I'll make some money from his reputation anyway throughout 2010.Here is the quote he gave fashion magazine Another Man. You'll have seen it in WH SMith: it's the edition with the grizzly looking Keith Richards on the front. To help you with the quote, I've added my own subtext in italics: “I’ve got six completed (at least I think they're completed, I'm not sure where music begins and ends any more). Two are very non-commercial, abstract, modular-synthesis, field recordings – those I finished four years ago (next to Analord, they sounded crap so I binned them).\"Another one is Melodies From Mars, which I redid about three years ago (my Bowie tribute album could be my big comeback after all). There’s one of stuff I won’t go into (it was my linedancing phase: I'd better not mention that); a comp of old tracks which is never really finished and always changing (maybe I can get Basshunter to remix Selected Ambient Works); and then one I’m working on now (as soon as I can learn a fifth chord on this guitar).\"He added: \"There are also loads of tracks which don’t belong anywhere.” Really? If I don't get anything less than a massive fourteen hour concept album with artwork showing Richard 'Twin' James riding naked on a horse with naked Aphexes sprouting from each finger as music tumbles from his many crotches like sticky fairy dust onto a million dogs in Windowlicker outfits, I will be severely disappointed.Anyhoo, you can read his fashion mag interview in lovely jpeg format here and here.If you can't be bothered to read it, the interview can be summed up as follows:Are you superstitious? No. I'm bored of this now.What do you do before gigs? Have a beer.  I'm bored of this now.Favourite noise? Wind. I'm bored of this now.Describe your music. dflaghaozoushiduqwd.

Technically, it is an  album by Chinese experimental duo called FM3. But it is an album like no  other.The Machine first came to prominence some years ago, when I proclaimed it as my new crappy plastic friend. That first unit loped around with me everywhere, and I even used it in a gig.The second machine from a year or two ago made as much impact on me as a fart sandwich and it's probably still in its box somewhere. But now, its third incarnation, called Chan Fang (\"Zen Room\") is set to claw for my affections like a friendly, annoying monster that won't go away.What's nice about this third generation is they have translucent casing, so you can ogle the gremlins inside making all the music for you. And it boasts - wait for it - \"advanced 12k audio quality\".The biggest potential is now you can line up all three Buddha machines and start to make genuinely complex music from the simplest of sound generators. You will truly be blessed. The Buddha machine is out later in November.Edit: this was the 500th blog post for Fat Roland On Electronica, so I've gone done a little medallion thing to make me feel better about life.

See the introduction to the whole thing here.Artist: OrbitalTrack: The BoxAlbum: In SidesYear: 1996I got the idea for ten Hallowe'en posts while watching Mark Gatiss' excellent History Of Horror TV series, which featured Orbital's The Box as background music. Orbital's Satan may have been more appropriate - that track even samples a line from, I think, the Twilight episode Nightmare At 20,000 Feet.But The Box was a sublime moment in which both sides of the vinyl release told an epic story in sound pictures: a horror film with no script. The creaking, the wooden chords, the chilling insistence of the clattering beats. Superb.As a fan of everything from The Stand to Sam Raimi, from Dracula to Dark  Water, I've always reserved a warm, soft place in my bloody heart for Hallowe'en. I like the nights drawing in, a creeping shroud to chill your bones. Thank you for joining me on my Hallowe'en quest. It's the ideal time for some dark electronica tunes - I hope you've discovered some good ones tonight.Don't have nightmares."},

In the same way that some of the most unnerving scenes in the Shining are the scenes of normality (driving in a car, eating breakfast together, getting knifey on your wifey... wait, not that last one...)Here I am, on Hallowe'en night, choosing my favourite IDM / electronica to accompany your fright-filled evening of pumpkin soup, bad clothes and legal doorstep extortion.

Try THIS!\" For its time, it was an astonishing remix.Oh, that and the track's called Religion and it has someone screaming \"burn you down\". Aaah, Hallowe'en for all the family! Seriously, though.

Also, the production's a bit rubbish and everything's too loud - a bit like a stabby scene in a Hammer film.If I was cornered by this track in an alleyway, I'd run.

Thanks for following this so far.I was introduced to Jon Hopkins by a DJ I did a radio programme with earlier this year. This is glitchy and menacing, like a spectre looming out of a Japanese TV screen.Hopkins succeeds in bottling the Autechre sound and spray-blasting it on filmic proportions until we are all drenched with the seeping red chords and that dismembered voice lurking within the beats.And get that drop at 2.27 - before the nastiest chainsaw of a bassline you've ever heard...Here I am, on Hallowe'en night, choosing my favourite IDM / electronica to accompany your fright-filled evening of pumpkin soup, bad clothes and legal doorstep extortion.

But Venetian Snares' Szerencsétlen gives me the cold willies every time I listen to it.The repetitive orchestral refrain, terrified by all the biting beats, reaches a frenzy of violence.Whoever matched all of this up with a Tom and Jerry cartoon for this video deserves a knighthood (wherupon the Queen lets the sword drop a little too heavily... cue evil laugh).Here I am, on Hallowe'en night, choosing my favourite IDM /  electronica to accompany your fright-filled evening of pumpkin soup, bad clothes and legal doorstep extortion.

Now we're back to the music.I could have chosen several Lorn tracks, but his testosterone retro is balanced neatly on Tomorrow with a scraping iciness. It's a short track, but it quickly flies in from an eerie distance until it's slobbering right in your face.It's choc full of slow, loping chords from the very (non-)mind of a zombie itself. It's flesh turned robotic, a beast sparked alive with an electric energy.And it helps that the video, which I suspect is a fan video, is exactly what's happening in Chez Fats tonight.

In this video, a bloke wakes up to glorious sunshine, puts on his favourite jumper and spends a day with his rollerskating duck chicken girlfriend.It has some lovely touches (the writhing duvet, the hands creeping around the torso, the blurry glass face) and, like a great horror movie, it doesn't end well.But more importantly, Murcof's music is so delicate, so dark and so downbeat, no Hallowe'en would be complete without it.Here I am, on Hallowe'en night, choosing my favourite IDM / electronica to accompany your fright-filled evening of pumpkin soup, bad clothes and legal doorstep extortion.

The scary soul-eater! The screaming monster! Aphex Twin in a dress!Even now, \"come to daddy\" continues to fail as my number one chat-up-line, but I'm still going to keep using it, dammit.The playful skipping at 3.15 is a beautiful moment and a testament to director Chris Cunningham's genius attention to detail. And if you want to fast-forward to the screaming bit, it's after the 4.00 mark. You sick sausage, you."},

That crying synth that comes in at 1.30? Gets me every time.As claustrophobic as Alien - and as, um, alien too.Edit: Reader Tom Davenport has suggested Autechre's Iera as the band's most spooky track. The tune sounds it's hiding alone in an abandoned shack when suddenly the trees come knocking at the door...It's Hallowe'en night, an evening dedicated to ghouls and blood and shrieks and sticking cereal on your face because you think it makes you look like a zombie.IDM, or \"intelligent dance music\", is the contentious term for the kind of music to which I have dedicated this blog. Its history is littered with monster beats, blood-sucking synth lines and drop-dead cool. Okay, I'm pushing the metaphor, but the darkness of Hallowe'en has a lot in common with the weirder nature of electronica.Tonight, do join me as I choose ten IDM /  electronica tracks to accompany your fright-filled evening. I'll post ten tracks in ten separate (and quite short) blog posts, all of which you can group together by searching for the Halloween10 tag. I'll try to be done before you have to get off to your Timewarp disco.Although my list has been completed in advance, do make suggestions in the comments and I will include them in some way. Just keep it IDM or thereabouts (here is a list of musicians to keep you going).The only thing you have to fear are your ears themselves. Happy listening and watch the Halloween10 tag.Picture: an edited screen grab of Aphex Twin's Come To Daddy. And yes, this track will be included in the final ten."},

When you look back on the past, you're looking through beige-tinted glasses. Don't go romanticising it.A clutch of recent and upcoming releases offer several shades of light brown for those with nostalgia in mind. Let's start with The Orb, who have teamed up with 90s uber-producer Youth to put out a retrospective of the acid house label WAU! Mr Modo, called Impossible Oddities.You may think you've never heard of WAU! Mr Modo, but you surely do remember their biggest hits Zoe's Sunshine On A Rainy Day and The Orb's Little Fluffy Clouds. Both tracks are here, albeit re-jigged. I'm more excited by the Orb's remix of Sun Electric from back in the days when an Orb remix was always called an 'Orbital mix', thereby confusing them with the famous but unconnected head-lamped techno duo that brought us Satan.Also, ambient sandal-gazers Seefeel are to release their first album in 14 years (artwork pictured). The band was relaunched by their original pair of guitarists a couple of years ago and, after releasing the summer-crackled Faults EP (the title track is lovely) in September, they have slated an eponymous long-player for a February 2011 release on Warp Records.And there's more. Hardfloor are back, this time with their eighth studio LP. Two Guys Three Boxes (the boxes referring to their beloved acid-making machines and not record boxes) will be out on bonfire night. And finally, we are moments from the launch of the Small Craft On A Milk Sea, Brian Eno's album on Warp Records and, for many, the most anticipated release of the year. Eno's album will be out on November 15th and you can listen to bits of it here.The old school is very much alive, well, and unashamedly beige."},

Orbital were playing their last ever performance together. That gig, on a John Peel Maida Vale session, broke me.I am a massive wuss.Of course, Orbital later reformed, piddling all over my ridiculously inflated sense of loss, but that's not the point. It was a beautiful wireless moment when radio did everything that radio is meant to do when it's not Scott Mills or the bloody Archers. Seriously, if Mills ever gets a part in the Archers, I'm moving to a hideaway a mile under the ocean where my FM signal will be fuzzy at best.Later that year, my sense of loss was compounded when John Peel ascended unto the great record shop in the sky. The bearded git made me cry twice in one year, which isn't bad for someone I had never met.And so it seems appropriate, six years after Peel's death, to post a bit of that session on my blog. Both band and presenter remain a massive inspiration. I can only hope John Peel will piddle over my ridiculously inflated sense of loss by making a Jesus-style comeback halfway through the Olympic games."},
{"title": "Blog Of The Year", "date": "Oct 21, 2010", "text": "Fat Roland On Electronica was the big winner, alongside Love Levenshulme, in last night's Manchester Blog Awards.I have been peppering the web with snotty flakes of false modesty in preparation for my campaign for blogputsch ending in failure. But believe me when I said I didn't expect to win anything; I meant it.Banana skinsThe awards event was held in the Deaf Institute and was graciously compered by Manchester Literature Festival's Jon Atkin. He introduced several short story readings by 330 Words contributors, all of which were brilliant and some of which included the phrase 'banana skins' in their text (by coincidence, but it proves I was right about 330 Words in my recent blog post).My Shitty Twenties, the reigning Best Writing On A Blog winner, raised warm smiles with her blog post about gerbils and About A Boy and the spelling of Gandhi, while previous winner Chris Killen peformed a remarkable Choose Your Own Adventure story in which I volunteered to be the protagonist.You can see us in Tom Mason's picture above, Chris reading the story and me making the crucial decisions. Except I've added a few speech balloons. That's me on the right, there. Chris Killen had me going on a date with crap hair then trying to escape through a toilet window. Or was it me that chose that? It was very chortlesome because he's a great writer.And then came the awards. Best City And Neighbourhood Blog went to Love Levenshulme, more of which later. Best Arts and Culture Blog went to Ribbons and Leaves, which combines old and new by scanning typewritten blog posts (I must dig out my old typewriter some time).The Best New Blog winner was the collaborative story-writing project 330 Words, while Best Personal Blog was awarded Might As Well, otherwise known as one of the brains behind Beards Of Manchester.Each and every one of these blogs bagged a well-deserved win, and I urge you to frequent them constantly.Slow motion As for my wins, it played out in slow motion. As a couple of my competitors in the Best Writing On A Blog category won in other categories first, my chance of winning presumably increased. The preamble to my category mentioned the winner having a \"slightly obscure subject matter\", and that, along with a knowing tap from Do A Barrel Roll's foot, had me furiously trying to write an acceptance speech inside my head in the five seconds remaining before my name was read out.On the stage, I took a slow sip of beer (got that tip off an actor a while ago!), hesitated because I nearly fainted from shock, and then apologised for everything I've said about James Blunt over the years. To go on to win a second award, and this time the biggie (Blog of the Year) was surprising and humbling and delightful and scary and all the other things that bubble up from your stomach when everything happens at once. It gave me an excuse to be the first person ever to namecheck Venetian Snares at an awards ceremony.Fat Roland the website has been chugging away for eight years, eight months and eighteen days, and as it became more bloggy (proper URL, some semblance of design) and more 'writerly' (six a.m. writing sessions, lots of editing), it still squatted in some obscure corner of the internet pooing out its electronic effluent on a modest gaggle of off-beat but lovely fans.Something small The extra sweetness from the yummy winnery was the fact I won Blog of the Year jointly with Love Levenshulme, another blog that is focussed on something small. but that something small is treated with passion and commitment and, it has to be said, sacrifice (turns out, one of them gave up their TV to concentrate more on writing, as did I earlier this year).The judges split the prize because they couldn't work out which blog was the bestest, a conversation I would have given my right arm to eavesdrop on. \"Aphex Twin or Levenshulme... Aphex Twin or Levenshulme... hmmmm... let me pipe Windowlicker in through Levenshulme library's windows, see what happens...\"I'm pretty sure ninety-twelvety per cent of Best Writing winners have gone on to be multi-millionaire novelists, so I'd better start writing my tome on Murcof b-sides straight away. I'll just copy out Dan Brown's books, twaddle a few words around and colour the edges of the book pages red because publishers think it's trendy.Meanwhile, will this blog change? Will it fudge. There are bleeps to be fondled, squelchy basslines to be goosed, and I'll be flappered sideways if I'm going to give up this corner of the internet in my battle against r 'n' b clones, despotic pop loons and Michael chuffing Bublé.Thank you for reading.

{"title": "My Manchester Blog Award rivals dissected", "date": "Oct 18, 2010", "text": "Edit: To see how well I did since writing this post, see the results here.With the Manchester Blog Awards nearly upon us (you can still vote for me here until the end of Tuesday), it's time to look at my opposition in more detail.The following blogs have been shortlisted, along with me, in the Best Writing On A Blog category. Let's see if they have what it takes to win the prestigious prize (to be awarded on Wednesday night).Specimen one: 330 WordsOn the positive side, this is a collaborative blog where people submit very short stories inspired by a picture. This ensures they have a wide reach and probably carry a lot of respect because of that. I must write something for them, if only to get reflected glory.330 Words have a search function on their site. So I thought I would test their mettle by firing in some fairly obvious phrases. 'Aphex Twin' revealed no results, as did 'Venetian Snares'. However, a simpler search for the word 'banana' (pictured) returned two hits. Nothing for 'sausage', though. I will leave you to draw your own conclusions.Specimen two: The Pigeon PostThis is a music blog. You know what one of those is because you're reading one right now, although Mr Pigeon does a better job of it by posting audio and writing about music. It is, in other words, a proper music blog and it's made right here in Manchester.The writing on 'Post covers nagging doubts at gigs, fruitless searches for new music, and railing against clichés in music blogs. On the negative side, he too has a search box and a scan for 'James Blunt hanging limply from the remains of his own broken career' returned precisely zero results.Specimen three: Ribbons And LeavesThis blog is a-- oh wait, he's got a Manchester Blog Awards logo at the top of his blog and a link-through to the voting page. Why haven't I done that? Back in a moment......Right then, I've done the same on my blog. Anyway, Mr Leaves types his blog posts on a 1960s German typewriter then scans them onto the page. It sounds exhausting, but the results are stunning. When I'm on his blog and I smash the side of my computer screen with the flat of my right hand, it doesn't go ding. This needs to be rectified. Ding.Specimen four: Who The Fudge Is Benjamin Judge? I nominated this blog in two categories and it ended up getting shortlisted in both of them. Here we have a personal blog that has an imaginative edge, such as a list of things to do this decade that includes \"live like a Moomin for a while\".He spends his time calling me a North Korea sympathiser stroke planet killer, which only leads me to scream out very much in the style of Matthew Bionic's query on Judge's sister blog Ask Ben And Clare. When I change my name to Kim Jong Roland, I'm going to nuke his blog.So there are the fellow shortlistees. It's amazing to be in the same category as the blogs above. There are other categories in the Blog Awards too, but I don't want this post to go on forever so I must leave it there.If you're going on Wednesday (anyone is welcome), you'll spot me being confused and drunk in the corner. I have no idea what happens at these things, whether I get to read anything at the front, or how many fist fights there will be.See you after the Awards, dearest reader."},

It also produced Luke Abbott (pictured), who recently popped us a debut album called Holkham Drones.I've sort of ignored Abbott since 2006, when I praised his \"manic atonal silliness\", but this debut for the Border Community label has regained my fuzzy attention span like a happy slap, a Tango kiss and brain haemorrhage all rolled into one.The album takes krautrock as its base (compare Abbott's Brazil with Neu's Hallogallo) and then weaves its repetitive curcuit-pumping machinery into a technoid tapestry of emotive, heartfelt electronica. Trans Forest Alignment is detuned pop melancholia, title track Holkham Drones is the very definition of sad disco, and the static beatbox of Hello Tazelaar dances a beautiful dance with melted synths that positively drip from the speakers. Stick that confused metaphor into your badger and smoke it.It may be too reminiscent of Boards Of Canada in places (2nd 5th Heavy), and it may try too hard to be Clark (Baalnk), but this disc hooks the heart and the head more than most dance albums released in 2010.Oh and in case you were wondering: Martin Brundle, Ralph Firman and that's about it.

Relationships in Manchester's creative community are hugely important, and the Blogmeet helps no end.Thanks also to those who attended. Blog types represented at the meet included 330 Words, Ancoats Tweeps, Bart, Come See The Duck, Do A Barrell Roll, I-COM, Inside The M60, Manchester Is Not New York, Me, me, me..., Nine Tenths Full Of Penguins, Power Is A State Of Mind, Roy Keane's Lucky Scarf, Scatter Cushions, SEO Manchester, Technical Faults, Tim Dobson's Blog, Voices From The Below, VUI Design, Speech Apps And All That, Who the fudge is Benjamin Judge? and Write In For Writing's Sake.If you'd like a mention in that list, pop a comment on this blog post. Meanwhile, here are some photos.I won a game of chess that night. Some say it was a slight fluke, but you haven't seen me take down Kasparov.

These guys didn't chat much. They just stood there drinking, while Do A Barrel Roll (centre) struck some poses:You'll notice the name badges in this next picture. I helped organise this blogmeet on the condition, set by usual organiser Kate Feld, that name badges were used. Sounds cheesy, but it helps the whole thing run smoothly and enables conversations like this to happen.. .repeatedly:Random person strains to see my badge: \"Oh. So you're Fat Roland.\"Me: \"Yes. I take it you've heard of my blog.\"Random person: \"No.\"Me: \"It's about electronic music. Do you like electronic music?\"Random person: \"Stop touching me.\"A modern design space, but note the old-fashioned clock. Apparently it gives the right time twice a day:If you misbehave at the blogmeet, everything will be noted down by Power Is A State Of Mind. I'm hoping we'll all end up as characters in a novel some day (or maybe just in his blogmeet write-up).

{"title": "Student's guide to new music", "date": "Oct 6, 2010", "text": "You're settling in to your halls or your crumbling shared house, but you haven't quite burned all your music from dad's computer yet. What music do you listen to if you want to be cool at university?Obviously, you'll be bombarded with chances to hear thrilling bands if you're in a decent city. Manchester Academy, for example, is due to host amazing shows from Bowling For Soup, Peter Frampton and Napalm Death.But this is an electronic music blog, so no doubt you've come to me for a few special recommendations to set you a few paces ahead from your clone mosher friends.The first and only rule of Fat Roland's guide to new music for students is: if you listen to any music at all, I'll smash your face off with that gatepost.Seriously. If you go within a thousand miles of anything resembling a rhythm or some kind of assemblance of melody, I'll kick you in the liver.Biology lesson. A remarkable thing happens to the human body between the ages of 18 and 20. Before then, your synapses are made from phlegm and tears; they lack the connectivity to enable you to appreciate anything good. So you'll foxtrot to Keane, fandango to Kesha, fast-step to Kanye.From about 19 or 20, you become a complete human being for the first time in your life. Your ears start talking to your feet and your heart, and what develops is a perfectly passable music taste that lives on for a decade or two. Your mp3s become file names like Cripple Bastards, Shitmat and Burt Bacharach (but only ironically).The danger is, though, and I want you to read this as though it's one of those ominous adverts for AIDS in the 1980s, a residual echo from your pre-18 days lingers in your brain, terminally damaging many of your cells and then hiding until it chooses to ambush you later. Imagine Simply Red hiding in your fridge all night, waiting to pounce when you get milk in the morning.And so, when you hit 32, all those old musical numbers you jived to in your teens pop back into your memory, and you utter the incantation that has destroyed many a cool person: \"D'you know, that stuff wasn't so bad after all. At least it had a melody...\"There is only one way to stop this happening. Your musical taste must be sliced off the moment you hit university. For at least one year, you must be sonically castrated and taught that all music is evil. You have to go through a reverse-Clockwork Orange, and watch Akira Kurosawa or Jean-Luc Goddard films while subjecting your pinned-open earholes to Will I Am, Tiao Cruz or The Saturdays.You should probably be locked in your room and bubblewrap be glued to every surface, including yourself. Your computer shall have an auto-tune filter, so anything melodic will sound like kittens being slowly diced with an apple corer.Save yourself from yourself, new students. Listen to nothing. Not even your lectures, for fear of catching accidental intonations or a dull recitation of a textbook unintentionally forming a pleasing pentameter that could easily be set to music.And all you will be left with is the cleansing wash of a lonely silence except in the dark of the night when the only noise is the dull thud of your heartbeat. Except, of course, a heartbeat is a recognised rhythm, so unless you've surgically wrapped that in jiffybags, that'll have to go too.I'll ween you when you're ready. We'll start with Boards Of Canada, then go deeper. Meanwhile, let the silence begi--"},

The monster hiding in the artwork of Flying Lotus' new EP Pattern + Grid World is watching you. DON'T LOOK INTO THE EYES. If you don't come, the monster will sidle up to you while you are not looking, rear up into your surprised face, open its slobbery chops as wide as it can and suck your sodden head like a lollipop.And if the monster doesn't do that, I certainly will.I'm being silly, of course. I don't mind if you don't come. I may still try and suck your face for fun though. The hosts, Umbro, have pointed out that if you are attending, come to the Newton Street entrance opposite the Captain America film set (it will make sense when you get there). A Google map can be found on the blogmeet website.If you were in Manchester last night and you found yourself in Sandbar, you would have seen my second Gospel According To Aphex Twin.

The decision panel is erudite and wise and every member deserves to be rich, to be creatively fulfilled and have extremely enjoyable sex lives.I have been blogging about the Mercury since 2006 (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009/2009 and 2010) and I have been nothing but positive about it. The bit where I said \"we need a new Mercury Music Prize for people that give a crap about electronic music\" and the bit where I said the short-list \"was chosen by a bunch of beered up old men with bellies poking out of their bermuda shirts and tofu caught in the straggly bristles of their jazz beards, whose net contribution to world music is the noise emitting from their farty bumholes, and whose critical faculties have long since been pensioned off due the fact that every single one of them has a fading poster of Avril Lavigne in their rancid toilet\"? I never said any of that. It's just your imagination.I do love The xx, but back in Fat Roland world, the Mercury Music Prize holds as much relevance as Piers Morgan giving blow jobs to CNN executives behind a photocopier in a rat-infested Atlanta newsroom.I mean, would Tristan Perich's new album make the cut? It sounds beautiful even though it is emitted 'live' from one microchip and is controlled by algorithms on a circuit embedded into a jewel case. I can't imagine the Mercury judges discussing this album at the back of a Mumford and Snooze concert. Have a look:Tristan Perich: 1-Bit Symphony (Part 1: Overview) from Tristan Perich on Vimeo."},

{"title": "Who do I hate more? Morrissey or Axl?", "date": "Sep 5, 2010", "text": "Regular sufferers of this blog know I like to have a public enemy number one: a Moriarty to my Jeremy Brett; a Joker to my Adam West; a seven evil exes to my Michael Cera.Things have been plain sailing so far, whether I'm comparing Sean Paul to a malfunctioning karaoke machine, calling Chromeo faux-retro Prince-wannabe lifeless post-Mika pap, or poking Prince, or calling James Blunt a Milli Vanilli imposter or suggesting James Blunt be castrated or wishing James Blunt be hit by cluster bombs calling James Blunt the son of a dead cat and another dead cat or blaming the Beatles for James Blunt or saying Bono is more boring than James Blunt or comparing James Blunt to a vagina and Alexandra Burke.But now I am torn between two new enemies: Morrissey calling a fifth of the world a subspecies or Guns N Roses' Axl Rose treating his fans like crap in Dublin.One one hand, Mozza's flirtation with racism is a well-trodden groove he should have stepped out of more quickly. On the other hand, Rose is demonstrating a basic failure to do his job: turn up on stage and sing.First, the flower-fondling fop. Morrissey seems to think himself untouchable, ignoring the press and replying to everything everyone ever says to him with a swooned \"well, aren't we all?\" He once draped himself in a flag and the liberal media has drawn daggers against him ever since. It was okay, however, for Geri Halliwell to dress in the same flag a few years later because, I s'ppose, she was well fit and that.It's hard to know whether Simon Armitage took his quote out of context in the recent Grauniad article, but Mozza certainly seems to treat issues of nationalism with a clunk-handed carelessness that compromises his integrity and makes it difficult for his fans to love him. I think history will judge Morrissey fairly though: in the words of Armitage's poem Poem:Here's how they rated him when they looked back:sometimes he did this, sometimes he did that. And now to the cat-squeezed voice and the kilt and the hair. Axl Rose is in such a stratosphere of rock glory, he will have no idea what it's like to live on beans and dust for a year to save up enough money for a gig. He disappeared for forty days and forty nights before turning in an album called Chinese Democracy (are you reading, Morrissey?) which sounded turgid and confused and, even worse, boring.Whatever went wrong with the Guns N Roses shows, who didn't wake up who and who was supposed to play until when, Rose's protestations at the organisation of the Reading and Leeds festival seemed shallow in the light of the later shambles in Dublin. But when you're in awe of bands like this, don't you expect a bit of diva nonsense, for them to over-use the illusion of the emperor's new clothes?Both artists are living off former glories - try and find any of their fans that *don't* like their older work - and the bolt-gun of retirement hangs heavily over the old heffers. At least the Smiths frontman can still turn in a tune or two. Which brings me to my conclusion.Axl Rose makes substandard music and presents it by snoozing in a hammock made out of his massively big head's bandana instead of hitting the stage on time. Although Morrissey can't match his past brilliance, Davyhulme's most famous quiff knows how to perform, how to write a song and how to do his flipping job.If, instead of writing this blog, I just did a giant poo on your computer screen, although I'd be improving the quality of your user experience, I wouldn't be fulfulling the most basic element of my job description: tapping on my keyboard while hoovering a quart of Talisker then smashing 'Publish' with my forehead.If Axl Rose can't do what he's meant to do, then he's nothing more than the anorexic bastard child of Mick Hucknall and Mickey Rourke squealing like a cat kazoo at a barrage of drunkenly-hurled bottles of piss.Yes, Morrissey, shut up, please, just shut up, but Axl is my new public enemy number one and James Blunt can rest easy.Squarepusher's got his funk on with his new project, Shobaleader One.This ultra-violet super-funkulent video gives us mortals a taste of the eternal bassmasher's new sound  A mini-album with nine tracks (d'Emonstration) is due for release in mid-October. He won't tell us who's in his new band other than to say they are \"a bunch of kids\" who are \"pretty frightening players\".Meanwhile, he has hopped over to Ed Banger Records to release the first track from d'Emonstration: Cryptic Motion is a Daft Punk work-out backed with a sharp-as-hedgehogs Mr Ozio remix.'Pusher wanted this project to be a \"clean break\" from his past sound, which may be a relief to some concerned at his inexorable decline into terminal jazz. See what you think. Here's the track list, and snuggled below that is an album preview along with clickable play-bar of Cryptic Motion. 1. Plug Me In2. Smash Unreason3. Into the Blue4. Frisco Wave5.

Most of them were quickly whipped down by anxious cleaning staff, but this one (pictured) survived next to the mens' loos for at least 24 hours.You'll notice the stickers in the bottom left corner. They appeared thirty seconds after I put the flipping thing up. Without me noticing. As I was standing there. Very odd.Other posters were the same bar the name at the bottom, which varied between different levels of stupidity (Susan Papp, Timothy Fishwhip). This poster is the only one that used someone's real name (Aaron Funk is Mr Venetian Snares).This particular set went brilliantly, and thank you if you are one of the people that made it down. I didn't actually play any Venetian Snares, but only because the venue manager specifically told me \"no Venetian Snares!\". Which I don't expect happens much at Gatecrasher or Ministry Of Sound, and so is testament to the wonderfulness of the venue.Anyhoo, back to the poster next to the loos. While I was stalking the men's toilets, which was constantly thronged by people of all ages and bowel states, I heard this very cute conversation between a seven year old boy and his grumpy younger sister:BOY (reading): Ha! It says 77 and a half.GIRL: That's stupid.BOY: 77 and a half!GIRL: They're probably 76.BOY: It says 77 and a half. It's funny.GIRL: It just someone having a laugh. There's no way they're 77.BOY: Well, I think it's funny. BOY skips off. GIRL takes one more look at the poster, then shouts after him:GIRL: Anyway, everyone knows you never put your real age at the bottom of a letter.I don't think they came to the gig."},

{"title": "467", "date": "Aug 18, 2010", "text": "This is my 467th post on fatroland.com. To mark this, um, momentous occasion, I thought I would waffle about my blogging process and, basically, why I am here.I fell into blogging when I stumbled upon James And The Blue Cat using the 'Next Blog' button nestled away uninvitingly at the top of the screen. \"Aha, a writer!\" I declared, and promptly set up my own site.The first post was in November 2004 (although I had run a separate fatroland.com website since the memorable date 02/02/02, which was later combined with the blog) and warned the reader to \"expect blogs from me. Because this is a blog. And not a dry cleaners. I  will not leave dry cleaning stains on your silk shirts, but I will leave  blogs.\"My blog used to be unfocussed, with thoughts on the Old Testament, wayward local youths and a large smattering of music musings. Back then, you can still see strains of my dark weirdness that regularly smears my blog these days:- Chiquita safetyadvil law biology: spam as poetry- Oh puppies, why do you live (my thoughts on the demise of Top Of The Pops)- My paeon to Boards Of Canada, It's the snot that makes it seem so familiar. I turned up the volume round here when I realised I needed to progress the blog or give it up. On New Year's Day 2009, I wrote a preview post that, in a way, was a manifesto of what this blog was about. I went on to post three times as much, a level I have kept up ever since.But this blog will never be a definitive guide to electronic music. It will never be a go-to place for people looking for authority or news or mp3s of Warp, Rephlex and the like. The most common comment I get about it is \"I don't understand your blog, but I like reading it because it's funny\". Hardly Wikipedia, huh?When this blog does become the \"go to\" place for electronica-heads, it's only by accident, such as the Autechre album that was leaked in a comments section and pounced upon by a couple of thousand salivating fans. Have I capitalised on that traffic rush? Have I heck.Still, I often wake up an hour early to get some 'blog time', which could mean writing a whole piece, researching, or editing something I knocked together a few days ago. Some posts come easy, others are like pulling a Christmas tree out of a cat's backside.I have this strange spontanaeity (Christmas tree?! Cat's backside?!) within me, this vivid imagination that eats away at my synapses and can cause me to be depressed if left unchecked. I think this is why I blog: I need to have that release valve.It's probably why people see me as the quick wit in social situations. I don't see that necessarily as a positive attribute: it's more of a survival mechanism. Humour is sharp and blunt and is the quickest way for me to hammer out the strangeness within. I am, underneath it all, a quite deeply sad person: making people laugh is the best form of defence against and connection with the outer world.Anton Vowl explains it well in his great piece about blogging:\"I see a blog entry as like those things they put in Chekhov's ear in  Wrath of Khan. It's there, the idea in your head, growing in your brain,  getting bigger and bigger, and all you want to do is just get it out  before it drives you insane.\"It's also, as Anton says, the immediacy of the process. At the age of 17, I became a journalist. I learned to need that instant gratification of perfect first drafts and quick publishing. It's why I'm also playing around with performance ideas and will probably, silently, without announcement, try stand-up comedy again. My non-existent novel can wait.There are 32 drafts on my Blogger dashboard. Maybe three will become blog posts. I will ditch my 'acid August' idea (a look at acid music throughout the month) because it's too late. My films of 2010 post will come, but not for a few months. And there are loads of half-written reviews of people like Caribou, Actress and Squarepusher.This post? Written in one go, deliberately unedited, and published.... NOW. *clicks*"},

Axwell of top ten chart ticklers Swedish House Mafia said in a Newsbeat interview recently (and repeated again on the news today): \"It's a new genre we made up, we're calling it 'brave'. It's not rave: it's a little bit more ballsy than that, so that's why it's called 'brave'.\"More ballsy than rave? More ballsy than Altern8 and their chemical attack masks?

I look forward to be able to continue my music and am very excited at the prospect of being able to dig deeper in my own work.\"Amid that clash of archaeological and artistic metaphors lies a musician who is determined to paint a solo legacy that will leave fossils of sonic goodness that last longer than the huge dinosaur imprint made by Battles.What will the future hold? Because Battles cited Braxton's unwillingness to tour as part of their mutual decision to split, I'm hoping Tyondai becomes a crazy, bearded recluse that makes Syd Barrett look like a jazz-handed pap-seeking celeb.As for Battles, they may be better off without TyBo's vocals. It clearly wasn't working for them, and it seems that without their frontman, they will get the album wrapped up in advance of a tour next year.A friend of mine dislikes Battles because THAT big hit sounded like Gary Glitter. Meanwhile, this eager blogger awaits TyBo's new material with tongue a-loll.Who will be better? The original band or the newly-free TyBo?And will it result in a massive conflict between them? You know - that type of conflict that's not a full-scale war, but not just a few skirmishes either. A conflict that's somewhere inbetween the two. There's a word for it... I forget....What do you think of today's news? Is this the day that music died? Are you too busy listening to country and western to notice? Leave your comment below and we can have a bit of a Battle prattle between ourselves."},

Brian Eno, king of the ambient and soundtrackist for many-an-airport, is to release a new album on Warp Records.I reported this here on Friday, but I can't help feeling it seemed a little too good to be true.

The results of the last one are indelibly stained in the form of this blog post.Naked people sponsored the boozebeer - or, more specifically, the Lowry and their excellent Spencer Tunick exhibition - and so the merriment spilled late into the evening. Because I'd been drinking bleach beforehand to steady my nerves, I took notepaper for fear of forgetting everyone's blog names.Or rather, I took a brown paper bag (see picture).Dear blog reader, I'd like you to introduce you to the people I met. The information I'm about to proffer was not learnt on the night, but is snippets of fact and fauna I've ripped from Twitter feeds and various loose ends of the internet.At least I can pretend I got to know everyone really well.If I have libelled you or neglected you or offended you or scared you from what is, essentially, stalking, please leave a comment below and I will make amends once I've finished off this bottle of handwash.Here goes...Dr Maria Aretoulaki does speech recognition and likes films that remind her of the Matrix. She tells students what to do with their lives. (Twitter.)Benjamin Judge writes stories about polar bears and likes a bit of Reggae Reggae sauce. He owns the Alphabeat album. (Twitter.)Dave Hartley is a rabbit-lover with a bent for science fiction. He has a sonic screwdriver pen and reads Nintendo magazine. (Twitter.)Fishink is a bit more of a mysterious online person, but I assume it is this artist who makes prints and animal illustrations. Edit: Fishink produces cards and notebooks and other lovelies over at this site. There are birds and hedgehogs and huffy-faced cats and it's all super lovely.Jordan Ahmadzadeh works for the Lowry and likes a bit of Muse. He likes cake, buttercough syrup and shower gel. (Twitter.)Gill Moore is a photographer and a Talking Heads-loving cyclist. She stalks peregrine chicks, but in a good way. (Twitter.)Go See This (Twitter) isn't a blog but is a website about things to do in Greater Manchester, and it's edited by Adam Comstive who owns a mixtape containing Mansun and Tribe Called Quest.Jonathan Hopkins is a bike-riding music blogger. He's outspoken about Mr Scruff's Get A Move On and once spotted Pete Waterman in a bar. (Twitter.)Kobi Omenaka is a snowboarding, capoeira-playing Ferris Beuller fan. His opinions on the early Sugababes was a point of some contention, mainly with me because I'd become aggressive from drinking battery the acid I'd got hidden under the table. (Twitter.)Richard Jones is a stay-at-home dad who likes a bit of sport. He writes for the Saddleworth News (tags include Delph, Diggle and Dobcross) and went to Slovakia on his stag do. (Manchester Twitter / Saddleworth Twitter.)    Marie-Claire Daly is an art lover who watches history programmes. She probably should have backed up her laptop.

He, like me, finally got round to visiting the Imperial War Museum North. He, unlike me, has learnt his lesson from drunk texting.(Twitter.)Mitzy has the campest blog title ever and has my favourite new blog because she voxpops to create blog posts and calls her site a \"news gazpacho\".Edit: Of course, I forgot Words And Fixtures. Again. Which is strange, because I thought to myself the other day, \"thank goodness I remembered WaF this time.\" But I didn't actually do the actual thing of writing the actual words about her on the actual blog. Anyhoo, Sarah-Clare Conlon went on the Sky Ride and her cat hunts peacocks. She has a predeliction for bookshops and putting up tents, although not usually at the same time.

It's difficult to network or to build up friendships at a blog meet, but I had so many laughs and met so many interesting people, it has definitely made Manchester an even better place for me than it was before.Right.

Like being gay, enjoying Springwatch or sitting in your hairdresser's chair and, when asked how you'd like your cut, pointing to your wallet photo of Justin Biebpipe.So what's so remarkable? Dubstep, that low-bass fuzzy sub-genre beloved of mostly ignorant broadsheet writers, is about to go mainstream. Magnetic Man's I Need Air scored well in the mid-week chart predictions, and it seems likely to go top ten this Sunday.Magnetic Man is Skream and Benga and Artwork. I prefer their other tune (MAD) because, well, I Need Air isn't very dubsteppy, but this is their debut single and you ought to rush out to your internet to buy it.What's most exciting is, if this goes top ten - or hopefully top five - it will be the first time one of my favourite electronic music performers gained widespread attention since that time when my uncle was arrested on Market Street for playing the spoons whilst electrocuting his nipples.(The video seems to 'crash' with the right-column of this blog.

By the time 808 State had released Don Solaris, we'd had brilliant techno crossovers from the Prodigy (XL Recordings) and Moby (Instinct Records).And yes, this final post in the Chosen Words series is going to be serious, without any surreal aphorisms or digs at easy Bluntesque targets. That's because I'm worryingly evangelical about techno, IDM and electronica, but we now live in a mainstream music culture where the genre (and this blog) seem to waddle around the edges without getting its porky toes wet.At the time of writing, there is a saviour in the form of dubstep's Magnetic Man. I Need Air gathered some serious radio play, while Mad would be the best single of 2010 if it hadn't been given away for free all over the internet.But without the mad creativity of labels like ZTT (now reduced to re-releases of older stuff like Art Of Noise, it seems), there won't be swathes of the public that realise, yes, this music is actually quite good.I once DJed at a wedding reception at a blizzard-buffeted Belfast castle, during which I played a whole set of Aphex Twin and Venetian Snares and the like.

This is what writers do when they're not writing blockbusters.In short, I took on Chris' own desktop and won, beat the challenge of the most minimal desktop ever, then finally fell against Socrates Adams-Florou and his army of folders. It lead me to write a terrible poem of 12 rhyming couplets in the comments of this post here., although thankfully my friend and colleague Dave Hartley took on the challenge after me.All very silly.

At the same time, dance music was going through a renaissance with Snap, Adamski and Timmy Mallett shifting major units.Artificial Intelligence, Surfing On Sine Waves and Bytes were key albums in those days. Many people expected more computer-related album titles, like PC World Are Shite, What's The Point Of NumLock and My Screen Has Turned Sideways Can You Help Me Wikianswers.Warp used to be based in Sheffield back in the Victorian days, but moved to London when the bleeps from the music kept getting tangled in the chimney smoke. What they should have realised was chimneys are an ideal shape for the extensive storage of vinyl records.Warp is an 'backronym', which means 'Warp' later became an acronym for any one of the following phrases: We Are Reasonable People, We Are Rubbish Philatelists and Westlife Abducted Ronan's Pet.While the electronic sound was taken up by labels such as Rephlex and Planet Mu, Warp itself recently discovered the guitar.

{"title": "Prince and the old power generation: how TAFKATAFKAP's 20TEN doesn't make me LOL", "date": "Jul 11, 2010", "text": "So Prince has given away his new album via a newspaper whilst pronouncing a death sentence on the internet, that great enemy of old-school journalism?Nice. The Daily Mirror has shoe-horned plenty of pre-release publicity into its rag, one example of which was an \"interview\" by Peter Willis which reaffirmed by belief that all old rock stars need euthanising, or at the very least, pickling alive.It's not Willis that got me riled per se. An associate editor (or whatever he is) is bound to toe the newspaper's grubby little line. This is the same man who once followed orders to post a story claiming Michael Jackson thought he might catch Aids from the Blarney Stone.But that didn't stop me going paisly purple with rage as I read his \"rare insight\" that proferred no insight other than, yes, TAFKATAFKAP is loopier than the symbol that used to represent him.Prince, says Willis, is \"a living legend who has sold more than 100 million albums over 30 years.\" Point of order: I doubt he's at the 100 million mark yet; if you know the figure, do leave a comment below. A few years ago, he had notched up 80 million sales, which means he is outsold by many including Cher, Chicago and Julio Iglesias.StratosphericWhile we're on sales, his 2006 album 3121 sold only 80,000 copies, while his follow-ups have numbered in the hundreds of thousands. It's hardly stratospheric. Oh, plus the few million more given free with newspapers and now lying in the billion-tonne pile of unrecycled plastic clogging up our planet.Sorry, dwarfman, I'm filling your head with numbers, and that can't be   good for you. He is a legend, but he is a legend frozen in time. His last three albums have garnered an average Pitchfork review of 5.2,  so I'm seriously doubtful it's a \"return to his early blistering form  which captivated millions of fans  around the world\".I might be wrong: I haven't let the album soil my ears yet. It could be his best  album for 23 years, putting his comeback \"on a par  with Elvis reinventing  himself in Las Vegas in 1968.\" Not my words: I hope Tony  Parsons' review was in no way biased.He has now released 19 consecutive singles (Prince, not Tony) without hitting the UK top 40. The run of failure is even longer in the US. Compare that with the culturally-reviled Cliff Richard whose singles still consistently chart well. Where are your fans, Prince?Captivated Ah yes, the fans, the millions of captivated fans mentioned in Willis' piece. Unofficial fan site Prince.org has less than 4,000 active members. As for his official sites, Prince's history is checkered. You'll already know about the Webby award preceding the closure of his New Power Generation Music Club. But do you remember his paid membership site LotusFlow3r which was, by all accounts, enough to make a dove cry?These says, he has no official website. In short, it's not the internet that is over: it is Prince's love for his fans. The short lilac duke will do well from this album, no doubt because of the hype from impotent bloggers such as myself. But before you reach for any one of the dozens of files already on Rapidshare for this \"newspaper-only\" album, think on this...Here's a man who declared \"all these computers and digital gadgets are no good\", instead placing his trust in the purital worldview of an autocratic organisation that abuses its members. He consistently refused to answer Peter Willis' questions and at one point even grabs his wrist to stop him writing. Man of the people, Mr Rogers Nelson.Hard-line And you should see his documentary collection. Does Prince truly buy into the hard-line evangelical Christian view about Hurricane Katrina being the fault of a sinful America? It's alluded to - only just - in the Daily Mirror interview, but for some reason, Willis doesn't push him on it. Oh... wait... um...He needs to be asked these questions because that kind of pop despot personality weirdness belongs to a wacko-Jacko land that has no place in our new-power internet world of shallow-and-wide fanship, that fabled world of tweety democracy that offers few all-dominating cultural heroes (and when it does, they're quickly stamped out, euthanised and, indeed, pickled).One last guilty thought about Prince, who is no doubt scanning this on his Google reader whilst chucking quietly at his anti-internet public persona. I do feel quite bad. A closed-minded electronic music blogger slagging off the symbolian sexmuppet?

I'll start with the music.Frank's moustachioed brother \"Hank Sidebottom\" (Martin Sievey looking like the Edge if he'd only ever been a truck driver) performed numerous tracks with the Oh Blimey Biggest Ever Band. Is that a fireman on sax? It is indeed.Dangerously crazed His impression of Frank was uncanny, as you'd expect, and they played all the trademark tracks including Born In Timperley and a dangerously crazed version of Twist And Shout. Sadly, his desperate call to a possibly-present Mark E Smith to help him out with the words to Hit The North was in vain.Badly Drawn Boy performed the headline set, and although musically it wasn't my  cup of chai, he melted everyone with a comparison of Sidebottom and  Springsteen (\"I'll treasure Frank's gig much more than Bruce's\") and his memory of a time he mistakenly bought a magazine called Bobbins \"like a dickhead\",  thinking it was about Frank and not about, well, actual bobbins.His  performance of Let The Sun Shine On Timperley would have made Frank  proud, as would his singalong Kinks moment that sent a wonderful phrase  drifting from the crowd into the Castlefield arches: \"as long as we gaze on Timperley  sunset, Frank is in paradise.\" Mr B the Gentleman Rhymer was a revelation. Think of a what-ho  musichall George Formby, then pimp him up more than a dash of Public  Enemy. I'll never think of Inner City, SL2, Orbital, the Shamen or,  especially, Tim Westwood in the same way again.He was so good, the Elvis impersonator's rendition of The Wonder Of Cardboard rather paled.Test cardThe telly bits were integral to the evening, which started at 7pm with Frank's stupendous test-card and ended at 10pm with bad quality footage of Frank playing 36 Hours with John Cooper Clarke.We were treated to lashings of Frank's show highlights, from inside his shed or out-and-about on an animated canal journey. Frank's interviewing style was massively gigglesome (who asks Adamski what colour pen he uses to write his music?).We were also shown Frank Sidebottom's Celebrity Sleepover, an episode sadly lost when  Channel M shut down but now 95% restored thanks to telly producer Dan  Parrott. And so we saw Frank doorstepping Smiths' drummer Mike Joyce with the introductory line, \"You know when I asked if I could come round and you said no?\"What followed was the absolute bang-on highlight of the evening, with Joyce coping less-and-less with an unwanted guest who took endless fully-clothed showers, didn't stop talking, and went on to destroy his allotment. You can see a short clip here.Emerson Lake Then there were the guests. The first was Emerson Lake ('twas Mark Radcliffe), who gave a tribute that was understated as much as it was moving: \"all of  us had our view of the world slightly shifted once we'd met Frank.\"Ex-BBC Breakfast regular Steve Blacknell recalled the time Frank met Frank Bough  (\"snap!\"), while Brian Little, co-founder of Hot Animation, revealed Chris Sievey penned  an  award-winning episode of Pingu called Bedtime Shadows (written in green  biro).Former Big Band member Jon Ronson, looking all bashful and Jon Ronson-like, paid tribute too, while Charlie Chuck tempered his usual non-sequitur mania with a sweet fondness for his old friend.I switched off during the football bits. Sorry, Frank. A bloke from Altrincham Football Club had me daydreaming about other things, although his description of Frank's cardboard box-based outside broadcast unit was quite lovely.Impossible And then came the finale. And this is why this blog post is almost impossible to write. This was a memorial service that burst with affection for a great entertainer. If that affection had been missing, what followed would have been horrendous. But it wasn't. You have to believe me on that, because it ain't going to look good on a computer screen...They wheeled on Frank's mummified body in a suitably 'Sidebottomed' sarcophagus. They then brought on a similarly bandaged and completely dead Little Frank... stuffed into a plastic bag.A debate ensued as to the fate of Little Frank, with the crowd chanting to have him thrown in the canal. \"Shall we kill him?\" came the response... and they did. They stamped on his head. They stamped on his head and chucked him, crushed, into the sacophagus with big Frank.It was brilliant. And wrong. But brilliant.Loss, love, affection and joy flowed from this uniquely silly patchwork of music. memories and moving pictures. It ended with Chris' son Harry playing with the Freshies, while his other son Sterling regretted a lost opportunity: he will never know if his Sidebottom moniker \"Roger the Boy Next Door\" was in any way a kind of vague sexual innuendo.\"Guess who's been on match of the day?\" called Sterling at the end. \"You have,\" shouted the crowd, \"in your big shorts.\" For Frank's sake, go and buy the single now and let's get it in the charts this weekend. You can search for it on Amazon too.Meanwhile, I'm going to dig out my old Oink comics and see what adventures Frank has been on.Fat Roland's A-Z guide to the most important words or phrases in electronica and their associated \"facts\"Natter in the comments section on my previous post leads me nicely to a slightly important element of electronic music: rhythm.Rhythm in music is probably the one thing that separates modern generations from those that lived through the age of the whinging crooner and all that screechy violin stuff they call \"classical\". You can tell rhythm has become more popular from a simple statistic: there were more hit singles with 'rhythm' in the title in the 1990s than there had been in the entire history of chart music. The same is true for the words 'sexy', 'fat' and 'roland' (probably).Drum machines helped bring repetitive beats to the forefront of modern music. A notable drum machine is the Rhythm Ace, which was distributed by Bentley pianos. The combination of Bentley and Rhythm Ace gave rise to an influential big beat collective called Midfield General. No. Fatboy Slim. Wait. Um... Chemical Brothers? I forget.The Roland TR-808 was a crappy sounding drum machine that rose, Cinderella style, to claim an affectionate place in pumpkin-- er-- music history. Its fake, electronic sounds were as similar to real drums as Scouting For Girls are to real music.The rise of the drum machine and the endless thirst for rhythm has lead to a two-word phrase that strikes fear in the heart of any responsible music fan: \"more cowbell\".

{"title": "Keep your scanners peeled for Lorn's Nothing Else", "date": "Jun 10, 2010", "text": "Emerging like a dense ash cloud from the volcanic Brainfeeder label (almost topical!) , Lorn has finally landed his album Nothing Else. The title is a reference to a question raised by John Milton in Paradise Lost, although if this long-player was literature, it would be something much more dystopian - Animal Farm or The Road, maybe.As soon as the fat, fuzzy synth lines drop in Grandfather, the scene is pretty much set: cloggy beats and loping hip-hop instrumentals that, perhaps, sometimes take themselves a little too seriously such as when the ghostliness edging into pomposity on Army Of Darkness.Oh but what ghostliness. Eerie, melancholic chords give way to thuddering beat patterns, giving us a soundtrack to a film in which Decker thought 'sod this' and went off to steam his head instead of tracking down replicants.The sounds are solid, eighties pixels of pleasure too - the masculine, rolled-up suit sleeves of the biting stutter synth in Cherry Moon, for example. If you don't get the odd frisson of Knight Rider excitement, then you should go away and listen to Busta Rhymes' Fire It Up and then work your way up to Lorn.But it's a modern album on a modern label. The best comparison I can give for this album is Clark's Totems Flare, and not just because it was mastered by the Clarence Park body riddler himself. It has the same boldness and playful fussiness - as well as vocals, which are more unusual than you'd realise on electronic albums like this.For those that have followed Lorn for the past few months, there is one depressing realisation. There seems to be no Until There Is No End on this album. His epically evil take on r 'n' b was such a ground-shifter last year, I'm puzzled to find it missing. Of course, it's up to Lorn where he sticks his music, but that track's spectre looms over this album.You see... there wasn't Nothing Else after all."},
{"title": "The Gospel According To Aphex Twin", "date": "Jun 2, 2010", "text": "> See a video of this talk hereBright Club Manchester invited me to give a talk at their debut event at Nexus Art Cafe in Manchester. So I decided to set up a new religion and present it to the unsuspecting masses.My brief from Bright Club was to talk about something I'm passionate about and to make it entertaining. My brief to myself was to make it sound convincing whilst making absolutely no sense whatsoever. It also had to be utterly un-fanboy, so there are no details. Just silliness.You can stream the full audio for the Gospel According To Aphex Twin here. Meanwhile, here is the full text.Gospel According To Aphex Twin I'm here to present to you tonight a new religion based on modern electronic music, and by the end of this you will be converted. It's based on the holy trinity of the analogue drum pad, squelchy bass line and bearded geeks in bedroom studios. This is the gospel according to Aphex Twin.To understand this gospel, you need to go back to the prophets. The BBC Radiophonic Workshop, who were working with George Martin before he became that bloke to do with the Beatles. Who knows what the BBC Radiophonic Workshop is most well known for? (Audience response: \"Dr Who!\") Doctor Who theme tune, absolutely right. Ron Grainger's notes to them contained annotations like 'swoops' and 'wind bubbles', it really was a fantastic new sound.In the beginning also, there were hippy-haired men in sandals. Some of Pink Floyd's more experimental was as close to techno as you're ever going to get. I've not got time to go into this now, but the Beatles really do provide the missing link between skiffle and the Chemical Brothers (come and ask me afterwards!).In the beginning, also, you had the puritans. Kraftwerk, who were clean and clinical, who stood there on their podiums giving sermons about wild ideas like pocket calculators and autobahns. But I'm talking about modern electronic music. In the 80s, a lot of electronic music was about going out, getting dressed up and going dancing, so you had new wave, hip hop, rave. But this is about what happened after that. When the musical missionaries brought Detroit house music over to Europe, it became something different. We know it as electronica, intelligent dance music, armchair techno or, my favourite, braindance. You had people like LFO who did this really ordered warehouse techno, which made Kraftwerk look like a free jazz band: they were cold and ordered  - and looming (you know when you get that feeling when the One Show's about to come on?). It brought techno kicking and screaming from the dance floor into the pizza-box strewn living room of the ravers.This whole group of bands gave us the new scriptures to follow. The Artificial Intelligence series of CDs was brilliant stuff. Their record label described it as: \"You could sit down and listen to it like you  would a Kraftwerk or Pink Floyd album.” This was radical for that time, it really hadn't been done before. Although that manifesto was later used to excuse trip hop, which is wrong.You had Aphex Twin’s Selected Ambient Works 85 – 92, our bedraggled poster boy tonight. On that album - it's a beautiful album - there was a sample from the Charlie And The Chocolate Factory film, the one with Gene Wilder, “we  are the music makers and we are the dreamers of dreams” – for me that was inspiration, it was like the Martin Luther King of electronic music. And Orbital's brown album, so-called because it didn't have a title. It was their second album and it was so unifying and so uplifting that if you go to an Orbital gig now, it's like they're the early hymn writers and people are raising their arms in unity and in worship. The NME called Orbital's second album “as warm as plasma and as eerie as ectoplasm”. And incidentally,I wasn't sure how to fit this in: Orbital are named after the M25, and I wanted to do a section based on bands named after roadways. I've only got The Streets, Duran Duran’s Nick Rhodes and Muse...So what are the beliefs of the Gospel According To Aphex Twin? Salvation can be found experimentation. We will encourage you to question and to challenge. So we've got Flying Lotus paying tribute to Alice Coltrane on his new album and Bjork has been working with techno pioneers for most of her career.Salvation can be found in repetition, that Hot Chip refrain of \"the joy of repetition is within you\". Repetition in this religion is not essential, but it helps you reach a new, higher state of consciousness (something falls down at the back) or make people collapse. Repetition is a political thing also: a previous government tried to make repetitive beats illegal. Some of you might remember the Criminal Justice Bill was a big thing. Repetitive beats technically became illegal, but it became law. Fighting it was a bit like like banging your head against a brick wall continuously and ironically.Salvation can also be found in staying underground. It's easier for me to fit through the eye of a needle than it is for electronica to get into the singles chart; it just doesn't happen. Autechre, who are the Mancunian purists of techno music, are wilfully obscure. I run a website on electronic music and for a while I ran a thing called Chartwatch where I would track the progress week-by-week of electronic acts in the singles chart. It wasn't very successful, and I've got a few of the entries here:- No new electronica in the singles chart. - Still no new electronica in the singles chart.- Simply Red are in the top 40, I'm off for a cry.So it didn't really work. Speaking of Simply Red, it brings me to the one unforgiveable sin, which all religions must have. The unforgiveable sin in this new religion is mediocracy. If you are, for example, The Orb and you record a 40-minute single Blue Room and it accidentally rockets up the charts and so you go on Top Of The Pops on prime-time TV and you're not sure what to do so you play chess, that is brilliant. If however, your album ends up on coffee tables, you start hanging out with celebrities and you've got lyrics like \"there was snow, white snow\", then you're Coldplay.Extremism is encouraged in the Gospel According To Aphex Twin. Like all good religions, extremism is encouraged. So Venetian Snares, one of my favourite bands, he sounds very much like a barrell of nails being rolled down a cobbled hill. I'd particularly recommend the albums Cavalcade Of Glee And Dadaist Happy Hardcore Pom Poms, Filth and Winnipeg Is a Frozen Shithole.I'm here to increase my religion, I'm here to grow my religion because I had to fit it into the theme of tonight. So will the Gospel According To Aphex Twin work? We will get organised, we will make Brian Eno pope. Electronica is dominated by a lot of the hallmarks of religion. So you'vbe got worshippers in communal ecstacy, you've got white middle-class, socially-inadequate men all over the place and also electronica's very good at looking down its nose at other people not quite doing it right.I'd like to end with a bit of involvement, if you'd like. This is where you become part of the new religion. I'd like to end with a call-and-response, a piece of liturgy. This comes from when Lady Gaga and La Roux and Ladyhawke were first getting successful and the Guardian ran a piece about \"chicks with synths\", that was the new thing. So I wrote a letter to James Blunt suggesting that perhaps he get on the bandwagon and... you'll see.If you can say the bits in bold, but please can you say it loudly and clearly and with conviction: We join together in the Gospel According To Aphex Twin.  Aphex Twin is the daddy.This is the First Letter  To James Blunt, chapter one.   Thanks be to Aphex.Dear James Blunt.  You should become  a chick with a synth.  Amen to that.You need to buy  a nice shiny silver synthesiser  and get it into  every publicity shot you can.  Praise be the synthesiser.You will, of course, need to  alter your gender.  I once cut the leg off  a teddy bear with my  dad's nosehair clippers... I'm sure changing your sex  wouldn't be much different.   Get to the point.I pledge my all to the  Gospel According To Aphex Twin  and his holiness, Brian Eno.   I will experiment.  Yes I will.   I will embrace repetition.  Yes I will. I will embrace repetition.    That’s not funny.I will follow the holy order of the analogue drum pad  Thum!  and the squelchy bassline.  Pyow!Lead us not into Maroon 5  for ever and ever.  Amen.This was the Gospel According To Aphex Twin. Thank you very much.You can stream the full audio for the Gospel According To  Aphex Twin here."},

I've done this before, and again most of the choices are mine. I spiced it up this time by asking some of my musical chums and contemporaries to include their own favourite tracks.If you want to play all the choons at once, I've fashioned together a YouTube playlist. Here are the Top 20 electronica tracks of 2010 (kind of) so far (sorta) in their entirety. If I was you, I'd jump straight there. (Edit: you can also see the list in MASSIVE CLICKABLE WORDS, thanks to a link sent to me by Cameron Reed. Ta!)Here are the individual tracks with their youTube links. Let's go!- Girl Unit: Shade On from the I.R.L EP.- Instra:mental: No Future (Skream Remix)- Africa HiTech: Blen, recommended by DJ / producer the 8Bitch. She also wanted to go for Ramadanman's Glut or a bit of Subeena or Brackles, but instead ended up plumping for the first single from the rather exciting Steve Spacek and Mark Pritchard collaboration.- Flying Lotus: Do The Astral Plane from his latest album Cosmogramma.- Gonjasufi: Ancestors, produced by Flying Lotus and taken from the Warp debut A Sufi And A Killer.- Caribou: Jamelia, recommended by Cameron Reed, a.k.a. Babe Rainbow who wanted \"something off the Caribou album\". Glad to oblige.- Pariah: Detroit Falls, recommended by Yer Mam. He also wanted to go for Brooklyn's Pursuit Grooves.- Lorn: Cherry Moon (link updated), who is bringing the Brainfeeder sound to the UK with his essential album Nothing Else.- Ikonika: Idiot from the Hyperdub album Contact, Want, Love, Have.- Son Lux: Break. Isaac Ashe's Sound Advice threw several recommendations in my direction, so I chose a Son Lux track. But he'd also like you to listen to Bass Clef, Bonobo and Massive Attack. Actually, I feel guilty for not including Massive Attack on my final list.- Starkey: OK Luv, the opening track from Ear Drums And Black Holes.- Four Tet: Angel Echoes, recommended by Isaac Ashe's Sound Advice.- Shlohmo: Spoons from the woefully overlooked Shlomoshun Deluxe album on the Friends Of Friends label.- Babe Rainbow: Shaved. Speaking of Babe Rainbow, here comes another of his recommendations...- James Blake: CMYK, recommended by Babe Rainbow and by Borland. Borland also like a bit of Gold Panda and are busy producing their own gubbins (see my post last weekend. - Autechre - See On See from their first album of 2010, Oversteps.- LV And Untold - Beacon (Mount Kimbie Remix)- Pantha Du Prince: Stick To My Side from the hypnotic album Black Noise.- Floating Points: People's Potential, recommended by Yer Mam.- Kourosh Yaghmaei: Gol-e Yak, an older track recommended by a superbly exasperated Two Fingers, one of whom said he was too skint to be buying music all the time, but \"on the plus side, I pretty much hate everybody. So I could pretend to like the shitty thrill-free dubstep etc that this generation farts out, but I'm not going to.\" That's rather refreshing, methinks. And he sounds like half my mates.A massive thank you to everybody for collaborating on this piece. And again, here's the whole playlist in one playable list which enables you to play it as one big list of playness, entirely without listlessness."},

It was also at a great wee bar, Oddest, which ought to be prosecuted under trade description laws.Bad thing: I spent all morning the other day annoyed at Coldplay. I listened to people arguing so I was annoyed at Coldplay. I was late for my bus so I was annoyed at Coldplay. I turned on Radio One and heard JLS so I was annoyed at Coldplay. Irrational, undirected hatred is not helpful.Good thing: I spent Thursday on my Twitter feed posting links to tracks Brian Eno has written or produced. For your non-tweeting pleasure, here they are: Roxy Music's Ladytron, Byrne and Eno's America Is Waiting, Eno's Here Come The Warm Jets, Bowie's Warszawa (which apparently gave Joy Division their 'Warsaw' name, I discovered later) and Eno's Fractal Zoom.Bad thing: I had an incredibly dirty exchange of innuendos with the poet laureate. We had both been drinking, I was talking about a delivery of her books, and \"in the back\" was all it took. I tried to spark off a similar exchange in a bar a few days later, talked about \"crusts\" and just ended up offending someone.Good things: Name dropping on blogs. Hootsuite. Getting up an hour earlier every day to write and not feeling as dead as I thought I would. Borland's Universe Trilogy (google it). Reunion drinks with friends I'd known fifteen / twenty years ago and it being *great*.Bad thing (which is a good thing really): I am leading a church. Run for the hills. Sanctus 1 were mad enough to vote me onto their leadership team. Thankfully, there are other leaders and so it's not going to go all Koresh. It will, however, go all Moonie and not in the way you're thinking."},
{"title": "While my guitar gently sods off", "date": "May 18, 2010", "text": "The recent news that pop music is outselling rock music is as an important a cultural change as the renaissance, the industrial revolution and processed cheese.For too long now, the tyranny of the guitar has ruled over us. We have bowed and scraped to our six string masters, as if rebelling against the jangly bastards was as bad as strangling Bill Wyman to death with a jack lead.The indoctrination starts early. Pony-tailed parents soundbomb their Smiths collection at pregnant tummies to 'train' their newborn into having good taste. Any gawky teenager showing a creative bent has a guitar and a Nirvana chord book shoved into their hands.Turgid And what has it given us? The Beatles, who were responsible for the worst haircuts ever and fixed Liverpool into the '60s for all eternity. Turgid rock behemoths like the Rolling Stones and Status Quo, who somehow made stadium rock acceptable and are therefore responsible for Coldplay. And James Blunt. James Blunt.Official Charts Company figures show a third of sales in the UK are now pop, compared to rock's tawdry one-quarter share. We have rendered our Fenders to the dustbin. Given ebows the heave-ho. Turned rage against the machine into a polite letter of complaint.Because pop music is more enamoured with the keyboard as opposed to the guitar, this means electronic music fans win. The keyboard wizard is supreme: Adamski can finally rest in the grave of his forgotten career.Breakcore Okay, it's only pop music and not, say, ambient or dubstep or breakcore. Having Lady Gaga and JLS at number one is not great - we'd obviously prefer it if Aphex Twin went platinum, and I'm not talking about his hair. But an unpopular, painful compromise is the step in the right direction. It's true. Just ask a Liberal Democrat.There are dangers in this brave new world. If rock bands start ditching their guitars, we could be saddled with more Ben Folds Fives and Keanes. They need identifying early. I would suggest border police at the door of every recording studio, with faceless but sinister staff asking everyone \"are you now or ever have been a guitar player?\"They would lie of course. But then the cunning officer, feigning informality, would mutter a comment about E flat minor seventh not being the sexiest chord. The secret guitarists' instant and obvious revulsion would see them dragged out the back, cut to pieces with an overly-sharp plectrum and buried in their own guitar case with the word \"IRONY\" emblazoned across the top in glam lettering.Windmilling Having said all that, The Who were quite impressive weren't they? All that windmilling and smashing stuff up. And I quite liked Madchester. The XX and Lonelady have a kind of amazing energy, y'know? In fact, guitar bands are fantastic. Who wrote this crap?Vive la rock music! Guitar bands are brilliant. If I find you buying pop music, I will slice you. I will smother you with Lady Gaga's hat until you are nothing but a vegetable blithering \"ro mah ro-mah-mah\" in the corner of an institution.No, seriously. For too long now, the tyranny of the keyboard has reigned over-- (nurse's note - Fat Roland has gone to sleep now. You can visit him again when he's rested.)"},
{"title": "I have just burned down my local NHS hospital while listening to Phil Collins on my walkman", "date": "May 14, 2010", "text": "Forgive me,  dear blog whisperer, as I bring the dirty subject of politics onto the  clean pages of the Fat Roland blog.I feel privileged  to have witnessed the events of the past week. It's like we've all watched a unicorn give birth to a kraken: we have a sense of pride to have been part of something fascinating whilst trying to ignore that niggling sense of horror.It has brought me my own dilemma. My political views were formed growing up in a Labour household in Manchester,  sharpened by the poll tax riots and set in stone when the music world  rose up against the Criminal Justice Bill.That spirit  of protest crystalised around bands like Dreadzone, Orbital and the  Levellers, more of which I have waffled about here.Which brings me to the Liberal Democrats. I have written the following comment on the Lib Dem Voice website:\"I hope  some good can come from the coalition, I really do. The move to roll  back Labour's civil liberties abuses is welcome.  However, I am a  left-leaning Lib Dem supporter who feels sold down the proverbial river  by the pact with the Tories. \"I understand the reasons why, in many ways,  the coalition had to happen - but the mantra 'vote Lib Dem get Tory' is  too hard a pill to swallow. For now, and with massive regret, my  support of the Liberal Democrats is suspended.\"You see, my head understands the hobson's choice Nick Clegg faced: side with the reds and bring down the country into a burning heap, or side with the blues and bring down his own party for the sake of Blighty.He underestimated the endless well of ire bubbling against the Tories. I agreed with Nick when he described the \"gulf in values\" between him and Cameron, so maybe I didn't take seriously the possibility of him using my vote to bring back Maggie's mates.I loved spending the night at the Manchester count at the behest of some  wonderful Lib Dem people, Northenden councillors Martin Eakins and a  newly elected Mary Di Mauro. And nothing will ever take away the sense of  pride when I voted for John Leech in 2005 and again in 2009 (and also in  elections since 1997).And so it's with a heavy heart that I suddenly find myself as a floating voter for the first time in my life. I cannot vote Tory. I feel betrayed by the Lib Dems. Labour have been shockingly right wing (see this piece by George Monbiot). And I don't feel that connection with the Greens yet.I hope I'm wrong, and that I return to the Lib Dems like a prodigal son.  But.... Tories? Seriously? Maybe I need to rediscover my leftist roots. Or just keep joking about the whole thing, as I did on my Twitter feed the day the coalition formed after jibes from work colleagues about being a 'massive Tory' - because if I don't be silly about it, I may start a poll tax riot all on my own:- Because I voted Lib Dem, I'm going to spend this afternoon being a MASSIVE TORY. Do join me.- I am being a MASSIVE TORY. I have just smashed in the face of a poor person. I don't think they minded. - I am a MASSIVE TORY: I have just burned down my local NHS hospital while listening to Phil Collins on my walkman. - As a MASSIVE TORY, I've just pissed on a disabled person in a council flat. I am enjoying being a MASSIVE TORY. - I've sent the single mums back to where they came from whilst shoving a miner down a pit. I'm a MASSIVE TORY.- My final act as MASSIVE TORY is to seek social justice and sanctuary for the alienated and afraid. Oh, hold on...."},

I will do, but in the meantime, Idiot is worth grabbing. Its punchy Nintendo lead is rooted in a rolling bass, a contrast that is amplified by the Altered Natives remix - a track with more pow than Batman thanks to a repeating descending fill that sounds like someone's spilling LFOs.Falty DL Falty DL's All In The Place is not dubstep. Repeat. Falty DL's All In The Place is not dubstep. Let's stop calling everything dubstep, shall we? It is probably acid techno and it's all a bit ho hum - choppy synths, bouncy bassline, loadsa reverb - until he allows a muggy rave line pull the tune into fantastic, foggy Aphex territory.James Blake James Blake, who has made his name touring with Mount Kimbie, sounds like he was in 1995 listening to an ethereal moment on Goldie's Timeless before jumping through a time tunnel to provide us with his sad, liquid r'n'b-tinged grime-tech.

{"title": "More crunch than Timbaland's cornflakes: Daedelus and Starkey album reviews", "date": "May 10, 2010", "text": "Daedelus The blurb from the label about Righteous Fists Of Harmony, an important new album from Daedelus, is hogwash, waffling about modernity and the end of an era and containing alliterations that would even make me blanche (\"bygone battle\", \"\"contemporary conundrum\", \"doomed to be destroyed by our  ingenious inventions\").Thank goodness the album itself is technically much better. But despite Righteous Fists Of Harmony being the Brainfeeder label's first massive release, the liberal appropriation of disperate styles doesn't work.On one album (it's a mini-album, really - more of an EP), we have sea-dog folk, Spanish guitar, claustrophobic psychedelia, soundtrack sweetness and pleasing loungecore thanks to the vocals of Laura Darlington, who also appears this year's much more successful Flying Lotus album.What bugs me though is how dated it sounds when Flying Lotus has appropriated jazz to staggering lengths (note the free drumming on Daedelus' Tidal Waves, then compare it to Cosmogramma) while folk guitar techno has been nailed with stellar success on last year's Bibio album.Daedelus should strip things down a bit: keep it simple, like the Ninja Tune video for Stampede Me, which does some really lovely things with red, green and blue.Starkey Over to the world of crunkstep now, and Starkey's Ear Drums And Black Holes album has more crunch than Timbaland's cornflakes. It's an essential buy for Joker and Rustie fans and is already one of my Planet Mu highlights of the year.Pick any track on Ear Drums and its more likely than not to sound epic, like it's the 'big single'. So hark ye the loping, grand chords of 11th Hour, the elastic band playfulness of Multidial or the synthesised orchestral fills of OK Luv.The stark truth of Starkey is he isn't doing anything new, but America needs people like him to keep them  oscillating in this strange, ghetto-crunk sub-genre that's genuinely giving a new meaning to the clubber's term \"bangin'\"."},
{"title": "Flying Lotus' Cosmogramma embraces the cobblers", "date": "May 5, 2010", "text": "Do you remember all that cobblers in the '90s about the Aphex Twin's lucid dreaming?If Flying Lotus hasn't spent the last two years in one massive lucid dream, I'll eat my trilby. His third album Cosmogramma sounds like every hazy memory and lazy Sunday spilled from his brain into shimmering, liquid gold.Los Angeles, his influential 2008 album, was all about the head nods and the knob tweaking. It deep froze hip hop into crystalline instrumentals. The new album is not that. In fact, it blows his J Dilla manifesto out of the water as he looks further afield to jazz, to soul, to the weight of a musical history few artists manage to encompass in one record.Cosmogramma seems ungrounded to the casual listener, spinning as it does from p-funk house (Do The Astral Plane) to shuffling workshop techno (Recoiled). It often jumps genres within one tune, but unlike that track-hopping scratchamentalist Prefuse 73 he plumbs emotional depths whilst snatching from different record boxes with breathtaking drive.Confused It's a difficult LP to hook into at first. The space jazz of Pickled confused me, and left me wondering if I was playing my mp3 at 45rpm instead of 33, while other tracks are pure lounge: Satelllliiiiiiiteee underwhelms, while Zodiac Shit is a laid-back summer afternoon.But one you get used to the newness - free jazz and plenty and plenty of harps - the wooziness begins to lighten your head. Ravi Coltrane's tenor saxophone lends a smokiness to German Haircut and...And The World Laughs With You smothers Thom Yorke's vocals until they're musical chloroform. It's a dizzying ride.Arkestry is the most leftfield, with mad drumming leading into moody choralwork, a dramatic edge that is only amplified by the descending melody and clockwork rhythm of MmmHmm. I can even forgive him the opening ping-pongs of a track called Table Tennis (what else?) despite dredging up the memory Enrique Iglesias' awful 'Ping Pong song'.SpellThe deeper we fall into the spell of Cosmogramma, the more Flying Lotus' place in musical history becomes transparent. Until now, FlyLo's great aunt, the jazz pianist Alice Coltrane came from another musical world: a different time with different ears. Until now.The genre-busting Cosmogramma, encompassing nuyorican soul as much as hip hop, ties his history in with hers. It's that echo of the past that makes this a real producers' album, but in a very different way from 2008's Los Angeles.Cosmogramma is a soulful kaleidoscope of genres, lending it a headiness not seen in his previous work - but its roots are deeep. FlyLo has drawn a line in the sand once again: it's time for his contemporaries to get dreaming."},

That might be simplistic: there was no \"massive machine\". Anyhoo, here, you can see their words appearing:Quite simple, really. Whenever a party leader mentioned a certain keyword, perhaps one that indicated caution or bravura or anger, an alarm went off.Their words were also reduced to the lowest common denominator, with key election soundbite words highlighted. Here's Nick taking about tax. His sound and image got fainter until he mentioned a concrete keyword, when the visual snapped into clarity once more.And the more they spoke, the more data could be gathered about how many times they mentioned certain topics. Here's the data analysis of the number of times each party leader mentioned, um, sex or things to do with sex. It even searched for the word 'titties'.The visualisations were sometimes very mathematical. In the picture below, you can see keywords shooting across a plane defined by the intensity of the television picture. That grey graph lump in the middle is probably Gordon Brown's face,And here we have more analysis, with the green numbers indicating the most commonly used words. Throughout the evening, when a new leader spoke, their respective data set rumbled to the front of the screen.It wasn't all geeky. At one point, they reduced the whole debate to photographs captured in endlessly shifting bubbles.And they turned each leaders' words in to massive pixels, which became smaller as they populated their screen with words. This is the television screen (a beige-coloured person in the middle surrounded by the lilac of the BBC set) rendered into large pixels - as more words were added, the definition would increase and the picture became clearer.Oh and they were redacted, scandal style.There were many surreal moments. I think in all, we had about 12 modes of visualisation. Here's Gordon Brown disappearing in the polls. (That was my attempt at satire. People often call me the new Rory Bremner.)It seemed Gordon Brown won most things on the night. He used lots of long words, he talked about key issues the most. Although David Cameron won the prize for being \"most vague\". Here's some of the final data being compiled:This is the brilliant visual of all of their words being attached to a cylindar, in length-order. You'll notice some spelling mistakes, but this is inevitable in a live event and is probably allowable considering the amount of word data being compiled. See? There's my geekery, right there.I seem to remember Nick Clegg mentioned 'money' and 'work' the most. (Note, Sosolimited's US spelling of 'cheques'.) Cameron was the winner on 'family' for most of the evening, as you'd expect for a Tory, but by the end he'd been beaten on that by one of the others.The 'you', 'us', 'them' measure was fascinating. Gordon seemed to use 'us / we' words a hell of a lot. Here's Nick talking about 'you'.Although that threw up a strange moment at the end of the evening. I don't remember this revelation being spoken, and it wasn't much covered by the papers... but can you spot Gordon's Star Wars moment in the piccie below. Yes. It seems that Dave is Gordon's mother.Rupert Murdoch can stick that particular revelation in his pipe and smoke it 'til it chokes him. Thank you, Sosolimited and FuturEverything for an enjoyable night.I hope Soslimited don't mind me posting my photos here. They have far, far better pictures on Flickr, where some of the finer points of data visualisation are explained.Meanwhile, I'm going to create my own remix on election night by scrawling a willy on my TV screen."},

Blogger's 'migration tool' (which sounds like a massive catapult for geese in the autumn) doesn't work. I've contacted their support service, but so far their responses have been (a) blank reply, (b) \"we're looking into it\" and (c) blank reply.So several things may happen to this blog on Saturday. It may possibly explode, go into overdrive, wither, carry on as normal or perform the musical equivalent of one of the following:- speed up until everything becomes a blur as in Moby's Thousand (still technically the fastest song ever);- become pretentious, overblown and annoying like The Darkness / Queen / the Glee cast (oh come on, you have to admit the sheen has worn off);- turn into Chipmunk.If I stop posting from this weekend, I would recommend you keep an eye on my tweets for futher news. You could even follow me, because if you like the crap here, then there's a lot more crap there."},
{"title": "A music round-up of the 2010 general election so far", "date": "Apr 25, 2010", "text": "As the UK political leaders blind each other with gaudy ties on national television, we're in danger of judging our new prime minister on what he looks like.Never mind our eyes. Let's plug our ears back into the election campaign. What's the musical judgement on the 2010 general election so far?There is little in the party manifestos about whether dubstep is dead or whether we are due for an early-noughties hip hop revival. Political pledges seem to be interested in non-musical things like the economy and health and education, which is rubbish because you can't play any of that on the recorder.Despite politicians' uneasy history with musicians, some of the policital parties have dropped musical hints throughout their baby-kissing trail. I decided to analyse the election build-up so far. Has the 2010 campaign trail been music to the ears, or are we already deafened by the political din?ToriesDave \"Look At My Face\" Cameron swiped a Keane track for his campaign and faced the wrath of the podgy-faced piano botherers. Somehow, though, he seems to have got away with using David Bowie's Changes.Cameron's Tories can rely on the support of the Cheshire set with appearances by Take That's Gary Barlow (seemingly limiting his endorsement to the launch of a talent contest) and getting an approving wink from ubiquitous Cowell-wannabe Sir Lord Baron von Andrew Lloyd Webber. Oh and a grime group called Nu Brand is writing them a 'choon'.Anyone who doubts Cameron is the new Blair should know Peter Cunnah is now a loyal blue. You know Peter - he was the one who sang Things Can Only Get Better with his band D:Ream back in the days when John Prescott had fights with crusties Liberal DemocratsNick \"I Agree With Me\" Clegg is hoping to be boosted by a Facebook campaign that promises \"We got Rage Against the Machine To number one: we can get the Lib Dems into  office!\" The repeated refrain from that chart-topping Rage track may come in useful if Nick finds himself at the centre of a hung parliament.Despite their revolution in the polls, the Liberal Democrats are a double-edged sword for music fans. Brian Eno is their youth advisor and Billy Bragg has praised their manifesto. But best not mention that Right Said Fred are writing a song for them, nor that Clegg used to play tennis with Gavin from dreary States-rockers Bush.LabourWhat about the defending government? Gordon \"Instant Smile\" Brown is well connected with \"the kids\", expressing a love for BBC 6Music and for Glee. He is, of course, lying through his rictus grin, although he does enjoy a broad support from arts organisations.Labour connect brilliantly with the old, hiring an Elvis impersonator and enjoying support from a Facebook campaign to get Eton Rifles into the charts. Let me make one thing clear: the Elvis thing is absolutely no sign of a political party in the throes of death, no way, sir, no.Labour connect with the new too - well, they would, being New Labour and that - with Hadouken! writing a song for them and both Cheryl Cole and Lily Allen pledging their invaluable support. Cheryl thinks Cameron is \"slippery\", although I'm not sure when she last handled him.OthersAs for the smaller parties, Plaid Cymru seem have finally embraced grunge by letting Gwiber play for them, while the Scottish National Party can boast a Runrig member among its ranks. The SNP will also try and cosy up to that annoying mouth from Reverend And The Makers in the Instigate Debate.Radiohead, meanwhile, have played a benefit gig for a Green Party candidate - a logical connection for a band famous for saving plastic and paper by releasing music online. Their 2003 track Sail To The Moon suggests a much greener method of space exploration.The BNP had their racist little knuckles rapped last year when they used Manic Street Preachers' If You Tolerate This, Your Children Will Be Next. Perhaps Slash 'N' Burn would have been more appropriate for that dribble-faced bunch of gurning pretend-politician reprobates.Summary What about Plan B, I hear you ask? That's certainly my thought when I come to place my cross. The cheeky grime crooner can't make up his mind in this general election, and will probably set up his own political party. Called the Plan B party. I can hardly wait. Maybe he can visit YouTube's eminently unclickable election song contest to help him decide.Incidentally, the House of Commons has its own band, comprising cross-party MPs playing Oasis songs and (shudder) their own material, all in aid of chariddee. This is right and honorable, despite making music that sounds like the Proclaimers after a double-stroke.So on balance then, with the Eno and Bragg vote, the Liberal Democrats have it. Nick Clegg used to be a massive Prince fan, although now listens to cheerful music like Rachmaninov and Johnny Cash.Next time he's knocking around my constituency, I might ferret him some Venetian Snares - although I might steer him away from 2007 album My Downfall."},
{"title": "A LoneLady among these dark Mancunian mills", "date": "Apr 22, 2010", "text": "LoneLadyWarp's wicked love affair with the guitar continued recently with LoneLady's debut album Nerve Up (LoneLady pictured above). I always wondered what happened in those smashed-window remnants of Manchester mills... well, here's the result.Nerve Up is low-fi and immediate like the xx, and like that album it carries off the impossible task of sounding retro and fresh. Hear, if you will, the spirit of The Fall, Cabaret Voltaire, Joy Division and, to a larger extent I think, Gang Of Four, and yet it somehow explodes with potent energy.Intuition is the immediate post-punk classic here, while If Not Now has the insistence of Tricky vocalist of Nicolette set to an unashamed '80s vibe. And she's not afraid to speed it up either, with the stomping disco of Army and the jangly, hand-clappy Early The Haste Comes.Sharing a producer with My Bloody Valentine certainly helps LoneLady's album groove and ride and wiggle its way into your memory. Much of the record is reverbed to hell, I guess to reflect the huge mills in which it was created, and so adding a nicely apocalyptic touch.My concern is if Warp can't convert this album into a sure-fire smash hit (the xx broke the top 40 last summer), what hope is there for any of their artists? I insist, dear reader, that this album is your guitar-rock purchase of the year.Loscil One for the guitar-phobic, now, and an album that is as equally atmospheric as LoneLady's long-player. Loscil's fifth album Endless Falls will envelope you, smother you and send your fuzzy mind spinning into that joyous place just before you drown with suffocated lungs.Seven tracks of warm, glitchy looping ambience (nine tracks on the vinyl) make way for an epic closing piece of, um, spoken word poetry. Not a single string section, not the tiniest crackle, not a single moment of muffled melancholia is out of place on this beguiling ambient highlight of 2010 and a true successor to Global Communication's early work."},
{"title": "We want hot modern classic and we want it now", "date": "Apr 19, 2010", "text": "My experience of mixing desks is generally limited to my infinitesimal world of home recording, DJing and tweaking knobs for bands at live events.What I've never got mired in is the long-haul experience of mastering a band in a studio. Unlike Mixerman, who committed his experiences working for a producer in a series of brilliant diaries.I have several mates who I love to talk production crap with, cherry-picking sweet snippets from otherwise dull r 'n' b tracks, or (as on Saturday) slagging off over-egged snares in reggae tracks.Mixerman captures this obsession with the mores of musical fashion with this wonderful treatise on his producer's insistence that the sound be more \"modern\" by using a classic amplifier called a VOX AC30...\"'Modern' can be very elusive as time marches forward, and if you're not up on the latest music, modern can very easily pass you by. AC30 amps have a sound that one might call classic, but a definitive classic sound scares the hell out of record companies, and when they listen to classic, they inevitably think something's wrong with the production.\"The real bitch is that sometimes classic is modern, but you just have to keep up with the times to know when that is, and then take advantage of that window of opportunity to be both classic and modern simultaneously. Regardless of all that, what the record companies really want is 'now,' because 'now' is something that record companies understand \"Unfortunately for everyone involved, by the time a record comes out, 'now' was 'yesterday' and the record is in the shitter for not being modern enough, even if it somehow happens to be classic.\"Occasionally, a new modern sound is born from some innovative band, and every major label in existence then scrambles to sign anything and everything that sounds remotely similar to that band. Then producers, wanting to remain modern themselves, will try to make records with the similar bands, so that they can be a part of what's 'hot.'\"Of course, none of it really matters, because no matter what, any sound that happens to become 'hot', 'now', or whatever, can be directly attributed to the Beatles. The Beatles are as classic as they come, and the Beatles used VOX AC30 amplifiers on their recordings. So why the hell classic scares a record company is beyond me, since without the Beatles, we'd be fucked. There's going to be a quiz on this later, so try to keep up.\"And this is what drives everything you hear. Thanks to Fil for pointing me towards this wonderful little piece of production prose.Mixerman has a new book coming out this autumn called Zen And The Art Of Mixing.

{"title": "The Brainfeeder / Paul Weller connection", "date": "Apr 13, 2010", "text": "It's easy for me to parp on about Warp Records all the stupid time, but there's another record label that is becoming a keystone of modern electronica.Brainfeeder is the, er, brainchild of Flying Lotus, a Los Angeles  producer about whose great aunt Paul Weller once wrote a song.*Mr Lotus, or FlyLo to his chums, started Brainfeeder as radio show back in 2008 on Dublab, a not-for-profit internet radio station set up by students. The 'feeder mission, \"we are here to feed brains,\" was reassuringly simple, and like a lot of good radio programmes, it was an excuse for FlyLo and his mates to play their own  music and the music they loved.Already with a toe in the door at Warp Records thanks to the Reset EP (used by the Adult Swim cable TV network, which means bugger all in the UK but is a big thing in the States), Flying Lotus was about to step into much bigger things.His 2008 album on Warp Records, called Los Angeles for blisteringly obvious reasons, had other music producers salivating over his complex, urban instrumentals. I even got drooled on by HMV staff when I bought it on CD (their dribble is like acid: it stings).As FlyLo increased his knob-twiddling respect levels to 11**, Brainfeeder morphed into a record label. Bolstered by a distribution deal with the legendary imprint Ninja Tune, the 'feeder now boasts Ras G, Lorn, Matthewdavid, Daedelus and the Gaslamp Killer among its roster.In fact, Daedelus's forthcoming Righteous Fists Of Harmony EP is the label's first put-out-the-bunting and stick-the-kettle-on release: it should propel them into the bleep-o-sphere.Brainfeeder is exciting because the music is so fresh and so clean. Ain't nobody dope as them. And it's a great complement to the Glaswegian DIY electronica scene championed by Hudson Mohawke and the LuckyMe collective.To wrap your ears around Brainfeeder goodness, this Red Bull Music Academy show is a good place to start. Or FlyLo and the Gaslamp Killer's Christmas present to everyone is also worth sticking on your iPod. Meanwhile, it's not at all long until Flying Lotus' droolworthy third album Cosmogramma is released on Warp Records.But then, I'm not parping about Warp, am I? I thought we'd established that.* Song For Alice (Dedicated to the Beautiful Legacy of Mrs. Coltrane) from Weller's 2008 album 22 Dreams (Mrs Coltrane being FlyLo's great aunt and wife of John Coltrane).** This is not, as you would expect, a nod to the classic rock spoofudrama Spinal Tap, but instead it is an endearing tribute to the maximum volume level on the BBC iPlayer."},
{"title": "No Burial was harmed in the making of this blog post: new tracks from LV, Actress, Pantha Du Prince", "date": "Apr 10, 2010", "text": "Time to find out what noises people have been making and say to them OI YOU LOOK AT YOUR NOISE.LV and Untold LV and Untold's track Beacon is so minimal, I'm not sure it exists. It's a terrifying slab of stretched-out, bass-whomping clicks and pokes, but it seems to nestle in a cold ether that exists neither here nor there. It's reality drawn out: the sound of loose cartilage if Burial's bones were all broken.I like this for the Mount Kimbie remix because it achieves a staggering feat. It smears a load of choppy rave chords over the dubbiness of the original track and manages to make it sound more desolate, more textured, and more like Burial not only with broken bones but with his mealeable body stretched out like uncooked dough.Actress If running Werk Discs (Lone, Lukid, Zomby) gave his twiddly-knob hands enough to do, it's not showing because futuristic funkster Actress is busy churning out some massive music on Nonplus Records.Machine And Voice is his latest, all broken funk and manufractured(TM) staccato bleeps, and not for the first time on this blog, I've found the real gem by flipping over to the b-side. Loomin' does what it says on the tin(Nonplus Records) and is the highlight here because of the ferocity of the whirring robotics.Pantha Du PrinceI'm delighted Pantha Du Prince's stand-out track Stick To My Side has not only got a single release, it has also got its own video that seems to mix two filmic moments from last year: the enthusiastic nightime dancing in Where The Wild Things Are and the eerie visit of the dybbuk in A Serious Man.It's a smashing track that mixes clubbiness with curious off-tunes and it comes on this single with a thumping remix from Efdemi, an all-too-busy workout from Four Tet, and, on the digital version, a heavenly choirs and bells retake from Walls. As I've said before on this blog, I'm discovering house music again."},
{"title": "Delirious' bid for number one: the rock delusion?", "date": "Apr 2, 2010", "text": "Delirious? are a Christian rock band that had a string of top 40 hits at about the time the Millennium Prayer was stripping the charts of all that is good and holy.This Sunday, the band's 13-year-old anthemic worship song History Maker will make a bid for the UK number one position following a Facebook campaign akin to the sucessful Rage Against The Machine campaign three months ago.Those who lack a religious persuasion or aren't in anyway mired in the odd underworld of Christianity are scratching their heads. Who the hell is this band? Do they really have fans? And why does the campaign matter?Poke Christian music subculture is massive. There are record labels, shops, radio stations, thousands of bands and plenty of eager followers. Fair play to 'em if they want to poke the charts with a stick and see what happens.But I'm not a happy Easter bunny. My objection to Delirious’ assault on the charts (I am dispensing with that irritating question mark) is based on two elements: the music and the message.The music is my first objection. I never minded Delirious back in the ‘90s when I was entrenched in Christian culture. I even sold t-shirts on their tour. But I was never fond of History Maker: it was too simple, too sub-U2. They had better songs, like Obsession. I don’t believe such a badly-dated track has a place in the modern music charts.Which brings me to the lyrics and the second of my objections: the message. The whole point of the campaign is to have something Christian as the Easter number one, as if a measure of financial success is important in this weekend of all weekends.Owl You don’t have to look far to find Christians in the charts. Joe McElderry’s X Factor song was rooted in American Christianity, while Owl City had the longest-serving number one single of 2010 so far: his connections to the Christian rock scene are well documented.And do you need Christian lyrics to find a connection to the ‘other’? Of course not. Delirious are not filling a Godless void.The lyrics of History Maker remind me of a time when I was young, naive and spoke almost entirely in absolutes. The song speaks of people being raised from the dead, the blind seeing and the fire of God bringing about miracles.For many people I know, their Christian faith is a quiet faith, one that speaks of humility and of comfort in suffering. And yet, History Maker boasts:“Cloudless skies will break, Kings and queens will shake... I'm gonna be a history maker in this land, I'm gonna be a speaker of truth to all mankind.”TruthEvangelical Christianity at its worst churns out worship songs that are all “me, me, me”, and this is exactly that. It espouses a pre-enlightenment, black-white vision of “truth” that has little place in my own faith.I admit I’m biased. As I post this, my ‘replacement’ is broadcasting on Refresh FM, so I’m not exactly a natural friend to the evangelical world. But it is a world I know well. I don’t think it’s all bad, most of the people in that world are, quite frankly, ace - and as someone who sold Christian music for nine years, I believe my views on Delirious to be reasoned.Having said that, if they make number one, I'm chainsawing my underpants off and sitting in a bath of woodlice and vinegar.PoorHistory Maker will raise money for charity, but it will not achieve its main purpose. It’s a poor advert for Christianity, the music ain’t so hot, and it sustains an inwardly-focussed Christian subculture that often separates itself from the world it seems determined on saving.And yet, it’s working. The midweek position of number six in the charts may well underestimate Delirious’ impending success in the final chart this Sunday evening. It is still riding high in the Amazon mp3 chart and I don’t think a top five spot is out of the question.It's just a shame they'll be trounced by the godawful Scouting For Girls. That's like being beaten up by scouts and girls, all at the same time. Even Delirious don't deserve that.If you want Christian rock music, start with Starflyer 59: they mention Jesus and everything. As for this Sunday's chart, I fear it may go down as an embarrassing footnote in yet another misguided attempt to propogate a form of Christianity that simply doesn't work any more."},

It recommended some good music. Or rather, James out of Hadouken! did in the newspaper's On My iPod feature.The new-raver (oh come on, they are not in any way \"grindie\") implored Metro readers to pick up a copy of Hudson Mohawke's funk-infused Rising 5 and described it as \"math-y, analogue space-funk with a sitar.\" I don't hear a sitar there, but I did discover this Boards Of Canada remix of the band sampled by HudMo for Rising 5.Shuffling death track James Hadouken! also recommended Flying Lotus' shuffling death track Time Vampires, reminding the dear Metro readers of a Lotus collaboration with the Gorillaz. Flying Lotus did drop a Gorillaz track on Gilles Peterson's radio show recently, and he's also been schmoozing with Thom Yorke - but no Gorillaz remix to report yet.He went on to plug Inside Pikachu's Foo-Foo by Rustie, except you'd need to replace that euphamism for something a little stronger. It's a stupendous track - as is everything by Rustie at the moment. And he also bigged-up (I believe that is the modern parlance) Joker's Gully Brook Lane.The Hadouken! chappie finished the Metro feature with Chase & Status' End Credits, a slab of drum and bass melancholia featuring the vocal talents of Plan B which worked brilliantly at the end of Harry Brown and provided Chase & Status with their UK chart breakthrough.I sometimes get a bit evangelical about electronic music, so it's nice to see music I like amid the usual Metro bilge of kittens, health stories and knowing irony.

There is a good reason.I wrote down the list in a red Silvine notebook, tore out the page, folded it into four, put it in the back of my fishing shorts, fell into a river, put the shorts through the wash, took them out of the washing machine, realised I'd left something in my pocket, thought it was money and panicked, dried the soggy paper on a radiator, realised it was my list, had a radiator leak, re-dried the list by breathing on it for four days, had an asthma attack, got home from hospital, unfolded the hardened remains of the piece of paper, used a magnifying glass to read the faded writing, caught a ray of sun in the magnifying glass, set fire to the list, burned down the house and not in a Talking Heads kind of way, trawled through the smoking remains (of the house that is not Talking Heads), found the strangely intact list next to a charred teddy bear, jumped on a neighbour's computer to type it before anything else went wrong, buried the list so nothing else could get at it, went fishing, forgot my shorts.So that's why I haven't posted this list until now.

How hard can they be? This is like falling off a blog. Dead easy. Like pissing on a duck. Let's test my big new idea with a basic comparison question:If you like Orbital, what else do you buy?Here is my list of bands that sound like Orbital, or at least, music you may want to listen to if you haven't the foggiest about electronic music but you happen to have bought an Orbital album or two. The list includes suggestions from other people given to me when I first started researching this 361 frickin' days ago.Remember. This is the start of my Big New Idea. I am a genius, so this cannot possibly go wrong.If you like Orbital, try...- µ-Ziq. He has that melodic thing going on along with a crunchiness of rhythm that Orbital fans like.- Boards of Canada and Bola. Both artists ooze with Orbital-style melancholy and are both fairly accessible.- The Black Dog and Plaid. Experimentalism meats warm analogue techno goodness.- Kruder and Dorfmeister. Maybe, although I'm not quite sure. - Photek. Feel the darkness. The complexity in the rhythmic structure. No? Next!- Crystal Castles, but only their track Untrust Us.- Long Range. This is the guy from Orbital. This list is useless.- Lemon Jelly. Oh now come on, that's taking the Michaelangelo.- Mannheim Steamroller? Trans Siberian Orchestra? Nah. Pentatonik! Closer with that last one, although it's the old techno band not the more recent rock band.- The theme tune to the Equalizer. Well, actually, now you come to think about it...- Lowfish. And the second track from Wahn's Alt.binaries. Hello? Is anyone still reading?Well, that was a pile of hairballs. It's my worst list  since I  listed Orbital's albums by colour.Scrap that idea. I'm off to draw up blueprints for my next brilliant scheme, which will involve (in no particular order) the chair George Clooney made in Burn After Reading, the complete works of Dan Brown, a blowtorch and sixty-two gallons of bathtub gin.*Actually, they're a lot better these days, but iTunes used to be shiiieeeeet."},
{"title": "Review: Autechre at Pure, Manchester, March 11th 2010", "date": "Mar 15, 2010", "text": "Autechre's show at Pure in Manchester last week was a mixture of the brilliant and the bloody stupid.TumblingThe hour-long set was grounded in hypnotic loops and much more beaty than new album Oversteps. We had rasping snares for the first five minutes, persistent knocking, and taps all over the place. The music sounded like it was literally tumbling out of the speakers.The first half of the set was fractured, gloomy and, in true Autechre style, awkward. As the mid-point loomed, we began to get more melancholic chords.And then, after some 4:4 rave masculinity (you don't get much thump-thump-thump normally), the beats seemed to kick in more. Or maybe I was just into the groove by then. They certainly saved their heaviest sounds for the second half.Desolate It was a desolate performance, the darkness deepened by the band's usual insistence that the flashy lights be turned off (see photo!), and it ended in a mass of wailing noise and, at the very climax, a mess of percussion.It's the Autechre I've known and loved a long time, and for about 20 minutes, I was totally immersed in every intricacy.I can't produce a track list. There was some Oversteps in there, but I get the impression they were going with the flow. Anyone waiting for a record-perfect rendition of Arch Carrier would be disappointed, but then again anyone wanting that has probably never seen Autechre before.Painful The support was superb too. Didjit diddled around with hip hop before extreme noise experimentalist Russell Haswell threw 15 minutes of painful circuit bending at the crowd.As a gig performance, Haswell's screeching, white noise and frequency murder only served to annoy. I did hear a friend claim this was music from the future, only to get a reply from a random punter, \"yeah, only after everyone was dead and buried, then someone shat on a keyboard\".But as a performance of sound sculpture, it delighted the geeky bit of me that has spent many hours building noises from sine waves.Meanwhile, Gescom collaborator Rob Hall's DJ set was the most straightforward thing of the evening. Proper, solid techno with a 1990s focus and ending with a stupendous remix of LFO's Freak.Stupid So that's the brilliance taken care of. This brings me to the other element of the night: the bloody stupid bit. This can be summed up with one four-letter word: Pure.Who chose Pure as a venue? Come on. Own up. The airport style scanners were bad enough: they insisted on beeping for everybody, so we all got some lecherous thug giving us the pat-down.Then you had to exchange your ticket stub for a paper ticket which was then exchanged for an ink stamp, all within the space of about four yards. It was, quite simply, silly.The moaning of the venue staff was nearly enough to dampen the atmosphere (you can guess Pure's level of awfulness by the number of Basshunter posters advertising a 'meet-and-greet' for £15), but then you had to cope with finding an exact sweet spot to listen to the finer bleeps of Autechre's music.Anyone outside that zone, which must have been most of the venue, would only have heard a muffled fog of meh.RoughThere are rough recordings of the gig here and somewhere in here. They're great if you like listening to your favourite band and someone else's conversation at the same time.Meanwhile, do read this guide to enjoying a concert performed by Autechre by a reluctant fan, which contains the joyful line: \"Listening to their music takes a lot of mental energy and can be  slightly agitating.\""},

Theme From S'Express is considered to be one of the greatest acid house songs.On seven inch single too. How switched on am I?Except, one thing you need to understand about my early record-buying habits is this: I consistently waddled into the record shop, drooled over the cool bands... and walked out with the wrong single.The S'Express single I own is Hey Music Lover, a track that no-one gives a flying sausage about.I make the mistake with Madonna too. I should own Holiday or Material Girl, but alas a solitary copy of Like A Prayer sits on the edges of my music collection like a religious freak trying to wheedle her way into the cool kids group.Adam Ant? Yeah, I own an Adam Ant single. In fact, I'm adamant that I am. What I refuse to tell you is that it was Room At The Top, which was released exactly seven hundred years, nine months and three days after he was respectable.Feast your eyes on my Bananarama 7\".

{"title": "House music and really big eskimo hoods: some recent singles", "date": "Mar 10, 2010", "text": "Pantha Du Prince's dreamlike house haze on his spanking new album Black Noise has got me in the mood for some four-to-the-floor action. Never mind all that cut-and-paste broken beat crap. This week, I want my beats fixed up and looking sharp. Here are some recent house singles.RaffertieRaffertie (pictured) is Planet Mu's top drawer dance guru, beloved of grungy club types as well as the glossy hacks of Mixmag magazine. Recently, he's been getting some big-time snogs from Huw Stephens, Rob Da Bank and Dame Mary Anne Hobbs. Which is nice.7th Dimension is Raffertie's newest single, and while the title is not as classic as last year's Wobble Horror!, there is ample to restrain your thumbs from twiddling. It's a whooping high-energy flare of rave house, convulsing from snare stab attacks and swirling, persistent vocals.The b-side, String Theory, sounds like a melancholic Way Out West experimenting with a wobble-board for a bassline. 7th Dimension is the better cut, and reminds me a little of Hospital Records' more zealous moments - without the junglism.Floating PointsHis bubbly 2-stepper J+W Beat enjoyed more than a play or three on my phone last year, so unfurl the bunting because electronic polymath* Floating Points has dropped a brand new track called People's Potential.He's not just torn a leaf from Luke Vibert's book: he's photocopied way beyond the legal limit to produce a thumping, nagging acid work-out with wailing synths and both hush puppies planted solidly on the dance floor.Track it down if you can, but I warn you, it's a limited edition one-sided white label. And they're harder to find than Lil Wayne's self-respect.The XXI've saved the best for last: a superb cacophony of remixes of one of the best indie bands of the past 12 months. There are several remixes of The XX track, Islands. And they're all fab.  Untold culled the coldness of The XX, secreted it in an igloo somewhere north of Alaska, hurled it into Heston Blumenthal's deep freezer, and fashioned a dubstep remix so startlingly chilly, your ears will ice over at the mere notion of listening to it. Pardon? Exactly. It's tribal, like Zulu, but in eskimo hoods, really big eskimo hoods.The Blue Nile's version of Islands shimmers and ripples, simple piano and electric guitar adding a nagging theme to the sparse vocals, while Nosaj Thing interprets the track as astral ambience. Delorean flings us back to the warm world of 90s intelligent techno, and, finally, Falty DL makes it sound like Tricky's record player's broken.Okay, I veered away from house music at the end, there, but I don't like my beats too neat: if it ain't unfixed, I'm gonna broke it. You can quote me on that. (Please don't.)* I only call him this because he can play the piano too."},
{"title": "If I was voting for the 2010 Oscars which I'm not, which quite frankly was a bit of an oversight", "date": "Mar 7, 2010", "text": "Edit: My predictions weren't bad. Look at the list of winners on the Oscar site.Fatroland.com is sticking around on Blogger for the time being, so before I hit my drunken stride again with my usual wafflings about music that goes whoomp in the night, here are my tips for the Oscars.Well. It would be a shame to let my Cineworld card go to waste.Best PictureHurt Locker. There's no real competition. Precious is an immersing experience, as blogged about here, and looking at Oscar's newly beefed-up list, several of 'em turned up in my Best Movies of 2009.But Locker has that perfect storm feel, like the third Bourne film or United 93. The other nominees are all worthy though, with two flies in the ointment: An Education, which I haven't seen, and Avatar, which is an awesome triumph of style over any kind of substance whatsoever.Actor In A Leading RoleJeff Bridges was the grizzled dad you wish you'd had in Crazy Heart. I still have a lot of Dude love for the guy: even now, my heart skips a beat when he's drinking in a bowling alley at the start of Heart. The gong should go to Colin Firth, though, for his portrayal of grief in A Single Man, if only for this phone call scene.Actor In A Supporting RoleThe opening scene of Inglorious Basterds is so simple, so beautiful and sets up the conflict with the minimum of fuss. The rest of the film was a disappointment, with the chilling exception of the crazy-ass Christoph \"That's A Bingo!\" Waltz as the Nazi officer.Actress In A Supporting RoleTwo nominations for Up In The Air? Really. It was a good film, but I can't help feeling a slot has been pilfered here. And I don't think Penélope Cruz should get the proverbial nod over Judi Dench, who was a all-singing revelation. So then. Mo'Nique should easily bag this as a brutally possessive mother and the best film villain since Anton Chigurh, albeit with real hurts rather than a two-headed coin.Animated Feature FilmWhat no Avatar? I don't see how that is any less an animation than the hand-scrawled works of Hayao Miyazaki. As for the nominations, I was disappointed with Fantastic Mr Fox, thrilled by Coraline, but would give an Oscar to the wonderful Up.The other bits no-one cares too much aboutI haven't seen enough to make a judgement on Actress In A Leading Role and a lot of the other categories are best left to the experts.I can tell you that Avatar looked great, the costumes in Nine were fabulous, A Prophet should have been in for best film, never mind best foreign language film - oh and the music shone in Crazy Heart, A Single Man and, above all, Moon. Does Moon count towards this year? Anyways...A final thought. If Serious Man and In The Loop don't get screenplay awards, if they don't start moving up the screenplay awards up the order of priorities, and if Kathryn Bigelow doesn't leave the Oscars beknighted as Queen Of The Universe, I'll eat my Cineworld card."},

{"title": "Best movies of 2010 (Jan / Feb)", "date": "Mar 1, 2010", "text": "In alphabetical order and not ranking, here are the five best films of the first two months of 2010. According to me, of course. Not that I know much, but if you've seen any other films, I'll tazer you.A ProphetFollowing one character scene-by-scene in a two and half hour French prison drama ought to feel like more work than it was, but this startling mash-up of Shawshank meets the Godfather races by. The first third is the best as we reach an Act One climax involving a brutal sex act which, believe me, is not what you've been led to expect. Tahar Rahim (pictured on the right, above) negotiates a tense tightrope of loyalty, racism and ruminant mammal dreams.A Single ManAnd you thought The Road was depressing? Of course Colin Firth deserves the Oscar. Since I saw the film, I've watched the phone call, in which he is informed of his lover's death, again and again. His performance in A Single Man is minutely studied, as layer upon layer of this collage professor is economically stripped until one little smile near the end of the film tells you everything you need to know about his journey. Contains serious levels of man totty.PreciousAnother Oscar tip, this time for Mo Nique as the sadistic parent of put-upon Harlem teenager Precious. I didn't think a film produced by Oprah starring Mariah Carey would be this good. This is a drama that wears its intentions a little bit too much on its sleeve (hey, we need to create character empathy, let's bully her to hell and back) but it is still a rivetting and immersing experience where the cold streets of Harlem will have you in tears.Sherlock HolmesNot my kind of film, so why is it here? Four words. Robert Flippin' Downey Junior. He performs the opium-toking sleuth as Johnny Depp played Captain Jack Sparrow: just the right side of unhinged throughout the whole film and a reeling contrast of colour and sparks to Jude Law's stuffy Watson. It's a shame then that the downside is its director, who mistakes story for fight scenes. Still, what amazing fight scenes (the double-scenes are a revelation). It's Ritchie's best since Lock Stock and that includes Snatch.Up In The AirClooney does his Tom Hanks, deadpanning it as a man who spends his life in airports. There are no fireworks in his performance, no hair gel obsession, no teeth paranoia, just a bloke who is slowly having his barriers kicked down by a delightful Anna Kendrick (playing out-of-her-depth to perfection). It lacks substance, despite Clooney going through some massive rejections. Could have done without the talking heads.Also-ransHey, Fats, you missed The Road. Yeah, I took a wrong turning because the McCarthy adaptation bypassed a rollercoaster of emotion in favour of  something akin to a trip to the shops. You're right, though, it was otherwise brilliant.Youth In  Revolt was Michael Cera giving us more Michael Cera, but that's a good  thing because he lights up the screen throughout - and there's a lot of him this time. Meanwhile, Daniel Day-Lewis is predictably an eye-popping, heart-pumping master of the craft as a washed-out Italian film director in Nine. It's just a shame most of the songs are tedious and the story seems to miss the mark."},

You can buy it from the Bleep shop by clicking here. You can also stream the album in the player below. The CD will still come out in the week of March 22nd.The album was supposedly leaked in late January when a set of tracks ran riot throughout the internet. It turned out to be an album by Altered:Carbon and was deliberately leaked by a friend of their record label.The label Section 27 later told me: \"[They] shared the file for one day and it went mental,  if just a bit hilarious.\"And it was hilarious, but it still left us without the new Autechre album. Then on February 8th, someone with a promo CD linked to the real thing in the comments on my blog post about the Autechre / Altered:Carbon leak. And the rest is history. So many people ended up owning it, albeit in a lower quality rip, that it seems Warp Records have jumped early.Happy listening. It's Autechre back to their bleepy best."},

My love for Paul Hardcastle is tempered by his tragic descent later in life into an addiction to smooth jazz. Oh and his manager Simon Fuller later gave us the Spice Girls and Pop Idol. Wait. Paul Hardcastle BAD not good. Screw you, Hardcastle, you n-n-n-n-tossbag.Les PaulIt's easy to slap the sticky Guitar Inventor label onto this man, but he also gave us a bucketful of production techniques including overdubbing, phasing and an unstoppable flood of country and western music. One of his first guitar creations was called The Log, probably after a strenuous session in the toilet, and-- oh, who am I kidding, guitars suck. I want to him because he beat all the odds (being called Les) to become a legend (a famous Les), but I can't. I just can't.Paul HartnollHe's the one out of Orbital who looked like a robot slightly less than the other one out of Orbital. He captured the anti-poll tax zeitgeist, he brought in a little mining chic by using headlamps, and he popularised the dance music album. Most importantly, he's in my favouritest band ever and has more talent in his left nostril hairs than I have in my entire body. And, yes, you've guessed it, for that very reason, I hate him. I want to stick his face into a blender, stick that blender into a crusher, then stick that crusher into Ann Widdecombe's gob.Pauls Oakenfold and van DykA double Paul on account of there being two in a similar field of dance music. Paul Oakenfold was once the producer-du-jour, smearing his particularly crunchy version of power trance over clubbers everywhere (and later reality TV droids). The trance music peddled by Paul van Dyk, meanwhile, made him into the biggest DJ in the world despite having a head shaped like a comma. Between them, these two men pumped their manly way into my affections as I sweated and gurned in darkened rooms while I-- (wait, this has gone way off course. Move on to the the next one. - ed)Paul PottsI watched this porn video once-- (that's enough. Sniiiip! - ed)More PaulsWell, I think that went well.

Here are the boring Pauls.Paul StanleyStanley Eisen was so dull, he changed his name to Paul. He then joined Kiss. If you're not sure which one he was, he had a single black star over his eye which made him look like glam-era Elton John after a hefty punch in the face. Stanley was never rock and roll, despite the Kiss persona. He hardly ever missed a show, he's had a hip replacement or two, he talked more than he played on stage, and he perfomed a duet with Sarah Brightman of all people. Crazy, crazy nights, huh?Paul WellerDon't get me started on the Pantene-haired Britpop-leeching plodfather of mod, Paul Weller. How he can bottle something like the Jam and let it turn into runny, tasteless like the snoozesome Wild Wood MOR dross, I'll never know. I blame Weller entirely for Ocean Colour Scene and The Enemy, two bands that cancel out anything good he ever recorded. If he was a colour, he'd be brown. And not even a good brown.Paul AnkaYou may not have noticed, but Anka's back in fashion after jumping on the Glee and American Idol bandwagons. This is very bad news indeed. He represents everything I hate about the 1950s: slick hair, white teeth, Elvis warbling and uncontrolled use of rhyming couplets (Diana alone has rhymes as tedious as 'me / see', 'say / play' and 'lover / other'). For a man called Paul Anka, rhyming couplets is a dangerous game. Except it's not dangerous: it's just dull.Peter Paul and MaryThis trio was drippier than a leaking tap on a drizzly Sunday. They gave rise, unashamedly, to the dubious notion that the 1960s were all about smoking pot and picking flowers. In fact, the Magic Dragon they sang about really was a crappy children's song about a dragon, while Leaving On A Jet Plane led to New Order being sued in a nasty bit of solicitor spitefulness. Drip, drip, drip, the 60s are dead and so is your childhood, get over it.Paul HewsonPaul Hewson, otherwise known as Bono Out Of U2, is a Pope-badgering, vocal-straining, swollen-eyed, God-complexing, post-unmodern, microphone-chewing, charity-mugging, tax-dodging philanthropist with a neat line in mid-life crisis trousers and an ability to keep shouting \"EDGE!\" in live shows like he's got some kind of Pizza Hut tourettes whilst simultaneously making every song sound like it was recorded for an advert for life insurance for the over 70s. He is now possibly the most boring musician on earth, and James Blunt isn't dead yet, so that's saying something.More PaulsSurely some Pauls are redeemable? This can't be all the Pauls?

(See Boring Pauls here and Gorgeous Pauls here.)Paul RodgersRodgers qualifies for this list because he was a member of one of the worst rock bands in the history of all planetary axe-weilding. He co-wrote All Right Now which got the spirit of raaawk into a headlock and squeezed all the breath out of it. The single ummed up the sanitised, by-numbers music that later led to similar fayre in the form of Lenny Kravitz and posthumous Bob Marley singles.Sean PaulThe ever-blazin' dancehall megastar imprinted himself onto the public consciousness like he was branding cattle. It doesn't change the fact that his hits such as We Be Burnin' and Baby Boy were the audio equivalent of listening to Stephen Hawking plugged directly into a malfunctioning karaoke machine. He had such a messiah complex, he called his third album The Trinity and gibes biblical-level wisdom to his Twitter followers: \"If it glitters it  dosnt have 2 B gold!!! It can B a fish scale! Carefullllll of dem  fish!!!\" Paul YoungI don't need to tell you that this silk suited soulboy achieved an amazing feat of perfoming self-strangulation to get that distinctive vocal inflection. To say his saccharine pop slop has made the world a better place is akin to suggesting UB40 have made it immensely easy for ginger white musicians to be taken seriously for their reggae songs. He is now a member of some Mexican-themed 80s revival band (pictured) who recorded the song Do We Really Want The Same Things? Yes, Paul, you do: you'll never change.Paul GaddI am a massive believer in astrology. So for example, I am a very typical... er... um... no, I have no idea about astrology, although I do have all the signs and dates memorised for pub quiz purposes. I do believe that the number one single at the time of your birth has an important bearing on your life and its various successes. So I will never forgive Paul 'Gary Glitter' Gadd for declaring \"I'm the leader\" at the moment my placental juices flopped onto the hospital table of life.Paul McCartneyThis pouting thumbs-alofting wannabe frog chorister destroyed all known music in the 1960s when he played a key part in a band that had a nice line in production techniques, boasted an uber-talented bespectacled songwriter, gave the world a Thomas The Tank Engine narrator, and yet was continuously thwarted by McCartney's attempts to turn every single track of the greatest group of its time into a simplistic, bedtime song predecessor to his pièce de ridiculance Mull Of Bloody Kintyre.Paul SimonIf only The Sounds Of Silence had been taken literally. I'm crying as I write this. He wasn't only satisfied with playing carbunkle to the Garfunkle with the drippiest pairing in the history of drips, he then released the audio equivalent of the Guardian newspaper in the smug cloud formation of Graceland, an album so plainly awful and worthy, Coca Cola's pillaging of the developing world can only be seen as some kind of misplaced revenge attack.More Pauls This is not over, Pauls. I have a massive list of Pauls. There are more Pauls, although be assured the Pauls will get better from this moment on. What about the Pauls that are neither here nor there? The Boring Pauls?

You missed the point: it has no relevance to music of any kind. That's a bit like looking at a cat going to the toilet and wondering which Shakespeare play is the funniest.Last year, I ran a live tweet of the Brits. No such fun this year, I'm afraid, but close observers of this blog will already know what I think of this year's winners.(Yes, this post is just an excuse to link to other bits of my blog, but there is some fun readings to be had if you get clicky. Here goes... )Forced castrationLady Gaga swept up the trophy cabinet in the 2010 Brit awards. I did once recommend that James Blunt become more like Lady Gaga with the help of forced castration using nose hair clippers. She's got a good turn in pop pap, but really, she's a load of old nonsense. I do detect, however, begrudging respect from when I live-blogged the Christmas Number One.JLS inexplicably won a gong or two. There were literally a billion better singles these past 12 months, although their award-winning track Beat Again did give me something to rake over on this very blog last month (\"I need love CPR,\" isn't the best advice, I mused.) JLS? Really?Florence And The Machine scooped the best album prize for Lungs, which I don't mind too much despite me claiming last month that \"The Source are probably rolling in their grave at her treatment of You Got The Love.\" In fact, I do mind. I do mind very much. If you own her album, you are crusty and merely six inches from death by old age.And Kasabian didn't do too badly from the Brits either. Kasabian are a bit like that friend you knew from school who's turned into a bit of a knob but you're still friends and anyway he keeps poking you on Facebook. I like to think my Kasabian tip for the 2009 Mercury actually applied to the 2010 Brits instead.Jizzle Zizzle Jay Z has had 99 awards and now the 2010 Brits are one too. I want to slag off the Jizzle Zizzle, but I can't. I loved The Grey Album and I've thrown him at least a couple of bones on this blog before (defending him against Radio 4 in 2006 and the wonderful Jay Z bar chart in 2007). Jay, if you ever fancy writing a guest post on this blog, I'm willing to talk money.I'm also quite a fan of Dizzee Rascal, the cheeky-faced hip hop Tigger who somehow straddles blantant commercialism and the urban underground without breaking a sweat. As far as this blog goes, I fell in love with Dizzeee Raaaaarskuw's name, I slagged off his Band Aid appearance, I compared Bonkers to Ace Of Bass, and I wanted to work with him because he sounded like Scooby Doo.Where the Brits really lost their way, of course, was when they declared that (What's The Story) Morning Glory was the best album of the past 30 years. Morning Glory is not even in the top 200. Peter Kay's now infamous comment was right (google it) - I've said before that Liam Noel Gallagher's gob needs plugging.Net of narkiness And this is where my crass self-promoting linkage almost ends. Sadly for this blog, there are two winners who have warranted many a mention but somehow seem to have escaped my net of narkiness.I'm amazed that Lily Bloody Allen has only had a couple of mentions on this website (once in an end-of-year review called Knobs, Cocks and Boils, and a quick namecheck in my Number One Album Chart Death Rant). I'd like to go officially on record to say that if clever lyrics were all that it needed, then people would have liked the Smiths. Oh... wait... I need to formulate a better argument, there.And the Spice Girls, gawd bless their union-flagged PVC trousers, have never had even the slightest mention on Fat Roland On Electronica, until now. I can't think why.So, there it is. Cry all you want, cringe to your heart's desire, but when you've already made up your mind about certain artists, as I most evidently have,  the Brits aren't worth the record company PR clause they're written in.Next year: Flying Lotus sweeps the board at the Brits and I completely change my tone."},
{"title": "Massive Attack got soul but Ceephax got swing(ing lampshades)", "date": "Feb 16, 2010", "text": "Hey, look, there is some albums what just come out!Ceephax Acid CrewI'm swinging from the bloody lightshade. United Acid Emirates, the new album from Ceephax Acid Crew, has got me prancing around my mansion like a brain damaged pixie. It's so lurid and colourful, like being stuck in an 8 bit Meg And Mog cartoon.The drooling, looping trippiness of the acid, splattered all over this album, is a constant, giddy joy. The opener Cedric's Sonnet is a sharp, spikey melodic number reminiscent of his brother Squarepusher in Welcome To Europe mode. Castilian is dragged kicking and screaming by a full-on, bullying bass drum, while the dated click rhythm of Life Funk reminds me of Felix-era house music.This is, however, not a stupid album. It's a serious step forward for Ceephax, where he demonstrates his various skills at chugging 80s techno anthems (Topaz) or off-kilter chord arrangements (Commuter). And all this with plenty of squelching acid moistness. Highly recommended.Massive Attack Are you bothered about a new Massive Attack album?  Of course you are: I can't believe you asked me that, you idiot.Heligoland has finally, um, landed. It's a full seven years after the band's previous studio album (\"If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing slowly,\" says their MySpace page) and nearly 20 years after their highly influential debut Blue Lines. And actually, it's that memory of Blue Lines that I can hear on Heligoland.Yes, there are guest vocalists (which The Guardian had down as almost unique in the dance world, despite the Gorillaz, Fatboy Slim and Unkle doing that kind of thing for years). Yes, there is gloominess a-plenty. But what this has, which I think 100th Window missed, is... capital letters... SOUL.It's an album that is destined for coffee tables, new year's parties and easy headlines about the vocal collaborators (hello, Guy Garvey), and therefore many serious music fans will brush it off their shrugged shoulders. Which is a shame.What will really get me all excited are those Burial remixes the internet's been promising.Pantha Du Prince Also out this month is Pantha Du Prince's Black Noise. Oh, and look, he has vocal collaborations from the likes of Animal Collective, !!! and LCD Soundsystem people. Read this and weep, The Guardian.Black Noise is awash with clouds. You know how some albums sound urban-y and some sound outdoors-y? This is Heidi the goat-herder's friend flatlining on heroin on the highest mountain in the world while buzzards perform a jagged dance of death around her.With sharp techno, dizzying loops, spiralling bells and smoky, smoky atmospherics, this will appeal to Susumu Yokota fans looking to grab something a bit more substantial by the goat horns."},
{"title": "Defending blogging against Blogger", "date": "Feb 13, 2010", "text": "Last night, I was sniffing through my 78s looking for something to write about. There's so much to cover this month, with lots of lovely new noise from Martyn, Massive Attack, Moebius, Merzbow, Mosca and pretty much everyone else beginning with M.And then I spotted a Guardian article that made my blood turn to ice pops. Google has been deleting music blogs for mp3 copyright infringements. It seemed that six blogs had been smudged off the face of the internet by Blogger after the service received legal notices under the USA's Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Some of those 'infringements' were for mp3s sent by record labels to be posted with full permission.I have never had an entire blog deleted, but I know what it feels like to have a post taken down.DeletedJust over a year ago, I wrote this article about an upcoming Squarepusher EP. I also included a free mp3 that had been dawdling around internettle for about a month. Blogger then pinged me an email which said something like:- we've deleted your post;- there is something you can do about it, but it's long and convoluted;- we could haul your ass in court, you know.- we murdered your cat. (This last bit may not be true.) No warning. I had never been in trouble before, what with my perfect grades and neatly-ironed school shorts. I was terribly upset. I restored the post using Google cache, left out the criminal mp3 (TV On The Radio are bastards anyway) and then had a frustrating conversation with Blogger that lead exactly nowhere.It was like talking to grandpa after he'd had half a bottle of whiskey, a ride on the teacups and a massive stroke all at the same time.Stupid egoI have not posted mp3s since then because Fat Roland On Electronica has never really been about free mp3s: it's more of an outlet for my stupid ego. (Having said that, I might not post free mp3s, but some, um, interesting stuff sometimes appears in the comments on this blog, as well as on my Twitter feed.)Interestingly enough, Blogger did tell me that I should have received warning notices. What absolute dolphin spit. I didn't. Not a single one. They also said the same thing to Massala, who had his blog restored this week and received a grovelling apology which said:\"What happened this week when we removed your blog was a mistake. As you no doubt know by now, we removed your blog citing repeat offenses of the DMCA. \"The problem was that due to a processing error, you had not received notice of the DMCA complaints we'd received for your blog.\"Processing error? Hold that thought.MiscommunicationBlogger's product manager Rick Klau said: \"When we receive multiple DMCA complaints about the same blog, and have no indication that the offending content is being used in an authorised manner, we will remove the blog...\"[If] this is the result of miscommunication by staff at the record label, or confusion over which MP3s are 'official'... it is imperative that you file a DMCA counter-claim so we know you have the right to the music in question.\"And so there is sometimes a breakdown in communication resulting in a false DMCA claim. Add to this the possibility of processing errors, then you'd think Blogger would think twice before deleting, wouldn't you?Once the blog is killed off, you lose your traffic, your momentum and any trust you have for your service provider. It is an extreme thing to do. Surely the music bloggers should have the right to counter-claim before their blog is deleted, not after.It's like appealing your sentence after the execution. Blogger's policy is patently nonsense.AbsurdityAdd to this the absolute absurdity of Blogger not even mentioning which mp3 triggered the DMCA infringement in their take-down notification (again, that happened to me a year ago and has been happening repeatedly since).I'm not even going to bother to defend the posting of mp3s: it seems like a good thing to do and it supports the ideal of an internet that is democratic and user-led, as well as bringing music to a wider, paying audience much more quickly than through traditional channels such as advertising, mailing lists and a music-starved MTV.Virtual Music has an excellent piece about handling the threat of DMCA notifications; if you blog, I urge you to read it.In the meantime, I will be watching Blogger's response to the situation and, if they continue to be thick-headed about the whole thing, won't hestitate to migrate to a better platform where I can write about music beginning with M in blissful peace."},
{"title": "Gonja Sufi's a smokin' nomad in sound and soul: plus Friends Of Friends and Babe Rainbow", "date": "Feb 10, 2010", "text": "Gonja SufiTime for some single reviews. The haunting voice of Gonja Sufi will leave an indelible mark on 2010, especially with his second 7\" single Kowboys And Indians. He's so unique, a nomad in sound and soul, that he hardly needs the production genius of eclectic LA beatcruncher The Gaslamp Killer. But it works like nothing you've heard before.The track opens with a buzzing that will have you packing your speakers off to the repair shop. What follows is a stunning blend of eastern mysticism, slacker guitar, psychedelic rhythm and a vocal that swings loosely between Bollywood theme music and Method Man aged 95.Gonja Sufi, that sinister, genre-smoking spirit of an electronic Hendrix, has produced the essential new sound of this year. The rats are already fleeing town in preparation of his all-conquering debut album A Sufi And A Killer (featured in the March section of my 2010 electronica preview).DaedelusWhere do I start with the first volume of a split-single series from the Friends Of Friends label? They've given Ninja Tune's Daedelus and debuting double-act Jogger three tracks each on the Friends Of Friends Vol 1 EP, but then they've gone and drowned it all with no less than seven remixes. Flippin' heck!Daedelus slaps down some disco house (C'est Super works nicely), then gets the guitars out and strums to a Smashing Pumpkins sample. Jogger concentrates on pumping house  (Litre O' Colais is especially manly, grrr) and then goes and spoils it all with vague electric guitar noodling, demonic growling and speed techno silliness.On the remix side, Prefuse 73 protégée Eliot Lipp puts Kraftwerk through an 80s disco mincer, while for his remix of Nice Tights, Nosaj Thing does a wonderful job creating a leftfield soundtrack full of guitar whimsy and minor-key boogie. A mixed affair - it could have been prettier without all the remix bling, as they'd no doubt say on Stockport's Next Top Model.Babe Rainbow I promised I would waffle about Babe Rainbow when the time came for his long-awaited Warp debut, the Shaved EP. It's time, so let's get the clippers out and inspect the scalp of Canada's premier dubstepper.Sorry. I mentioned the d-word. The thing is, Cameron 'Babe Rainbow' Reed is kinda dubstep, but only in a slow-motion, life-slowly-melting-before-your-eyes way. His noise is so deep and deliberate, he makes Massive Attack look like Scooter (the hardcore German funsters, not the weedy muppet).And so we have seven tracks of metallic, ringing percussion with vocals swamped with claustrophobic drizzle and an all-too-familiar whoomp bass. With the exception of sixth EP track Celebrate, I'm yet to fall in love with Babe Rainbow. Then again, I haven't used his music to get so stoned out of my face, my brain is melting on a toxic beach somewhere north of Jupiter."},
{"title": "How do you solve a problem like Madchester (and Fac251)?", "date": "Feb 7, 2010", "text": "I am Mancunian from toe to quiff. I am chuffed with my city's history, from the bravery of the suffragettes and the labour movement, to the creation of the computer, to the literal rise of the Beetham tower.But then, there are the pills, the thrills and, most of all, the bellyaches from a severe case of Madchester indigestion.I am not about to rail against the Madchester legacy. I will never forget the sense of pride I felt simply being in the city centre at the turn of the 90s knowing that this great city was ruling the cultural world.For someone who spent most of the day with his breakfast dribbled down his T-shirt and his evenings trying to smoke banana skins, I didn't have much to be proud about. So I bought it: I wore the T-shirts; I bought the records; I watched the Hacienda bouncers beating people up. Sweet memories.That nostalgia still feeds this blog to some extent, and I can find myself wallowing in musics past. And so you'd think I would have been at the launch of Madchester-themed club FAC25: Factory Manchester last night, right?Man boobs Not right. Quite the opposite of right, in fact.This whole Madchester revival really gets on my man boobs. Peters Hook and Saville seem determined to keep Manchester in some kind of memory-fogged haze, rewriting the Stone Roses era into a story that needs to be told again and again. This story they're weaving is dragging us into the past: we're caught in the loom and we can't tug free. The Manchester Passion didn't help, and neither did 1960s tribute band Oasis.Legendary album cover designer Peter Saville is some kind of adviser to the city council on a billion squillion plopillion pounds a year. As for Hooky, the picture above* from last night's launch does not fill me with pride. It's classic Hook with his low-slung bass guitar, but it seems strangely dated like a scouser with a bowl haircut. Or anything new by Coldplay.But this is not a rant against Peter Hook and his mates, either. Can you blame them? What else are they going to do? This isn't some weird utopia when we can leave old rock stars to die in the woods out of the sight of the youngsters.  Let them play: they made it. The  Fuc51 blog is amusing, but we should celebrate Madchester in the right place at the right time. No, FAC251 isn't the problem. Peter Hook isn't the problem. Madchester per se is not the problem. The problem, dear reader, is you**.Right arm You've googled FAC251 because you ripped off your right arm to attend the launch night and you landed on this blog looking for reviews, reactions, piccies and videos.  The problem is you. You buy into Madchester as an icon of history. You trade off the city's heritage like it's some kind of museum. Yeah, it's cool, you got \"mad for it\" and now you can wear hoodies without looking like a tosspot and say \"Y'alright, our kid?\" in your Hastings accent.You're probably not old enough to remember the halcyon days of crap Northside singles and cheaply-produced cow t-shirts. You do know the Hacienda became seriously crap, right?If you recognise yourself in my description, you must leave the city now. I will come for you. I will beat you to a pulp with my smiley face cannabis tin. I am Mancunian, which automatically makes me think you can come and have a go if you consider yourself to possess an adequate level of hardness.Zit craters You are a fair-weather, nostalgia-leeching cultural blank page. You are a Boddingtons Mancunian. You pretend and pretend and pretend and then you move on, looking for the next nostalgia-trough in which to nuzzle your snivelling, zit-cratered face. You are the problem. You must leave the city immediately and stop attending Madchester club nights.Madchester. Right place, right time. Let's build a massive statue of Shaun Ryder's head. We'll bow down before it once a year, smearing it in liquid ecstacy, paint and exploded pigeons***. But otherwise, we will get our fix from the Warehouse Project / Sankey's Soap / Islington Mill / Sacred Trinity / whatever floats your musical boat.Like The Guardian, like Manchizzle, like Words Dept, I believe we need new spectacles when we look at Manchester culture.That rose tint clashes with your Afflecks hoody anyway.* photo: Tim Dobson.

{"title": "Jóhann Jóhannsson, Simian Mobile Disco and a pants-dropping Skream: new and recent releases reviewed", "date": "Feb 4, 2010", "text": "Before I get stuck into February proper, please allow me to catch up with a few musical missives that I intended to waffle about last month but didn't get round to because I was too busy sniffing baby wipes.Jóhann JóhannssonThis is from a while ago, but I wanted to mention it because I saw him live last year. Swathes of swooshing strings is the order of the day for Jóhann Jóhannsson's album And In The Endless Pause There Came The Sound Of Bees.Jóhann, who has a name that never seems to finish like Banarama, produces classical music with shavings of electronica and can often be seen playing to bleep-heads. His ostentatiously titled album is in turns delicate and flamboyant, but I can't be doing with the morning-has-broken cheery stuff and would much rather he stick to the murky ambience or the eerie foreboding of his most filmic tracks.Skream (pictured)A couple of tracks now. The cold refrain on Skream's remix of Instra:mental's No Future (\"lies confusion government control\") is nothing short of pants-droppingly brilliant. It's a lolloping half-stepper that stomps its metal legs until you're marching to the same, automatic beat. It threatens to fall into the wobble bass cliche so beloved of dubstep, but it remains purely minimalist.Speaking of minimalism, Minimalistix is the name of the track on the b-side of the Skream remix. The paddy drums (as in drums that sound like soft pads: it's not me being racist) fight against airy soundclaps as the cut builds and builds and builds.It reminds me a little of the strange alien isolation of Higher Intelligence Agency and despite its stubborn simplicity, I could play it repeatedly and not get bored: Skream's remix is definitely something to Munch on. (See what I did there?)Simian Mobile DiscoBeth Ditto, her with the big gob, struck gold when she recorded Good Intentions with Simian Mobile Disco last year. You may want to know there are a couple of remixes doing the rounds, but to be honest former Hacienda resident Greg Wilson's retro stylings have far too much bongo (yes, you can have too much bongo), while Maurice Fulton's disco-tastic take on the track is the kind of generic funk groove that has me sulking in the corner of the club waiting for the good tunes to come on.Picture from Nailler 9."},
{"title": "Aphex Twin + Britney + Beastie Boys + 808 State + anything, really", "date": "Feb 1, 2010", "text": "If you mashed-up this blog with a successful blog, the internet would probably explode.Some things shouldn't be mixed. I remain convinced that most MTV mash-ups were a calamitous waste of cathode rays and I have heard too many DJs ruin two separate tracks by smashing them together until the clubbers were sliced to death from airborne shards of shattered vinyl.I always beatmixed until I started DJing my particular brand of electronic complexity some years ago. I then boasted that my record collection was beyond any sensible time signature and tracks could not be mixed or mashed into each other without the result sounding like some elephant in chainmail parkouring over corrugated shed roofs.But that hasn't stopped people trying, particularly with the Cornish king of electronica, Mr Aphex Twin. Let's have a look at some of them, shall we?Aphex Twin mash-upsThis MIA versus Aphex Twin mash-up sounds impressive at first, but it's a little muddy and the Aphex track, Windowlicker, inevitably ends up drowning out the genre-hopping vocalist.This AFX  mash-up with classic jam-pumpin' house band Technotronic really is just a DJ finding the right BPM and making sure the audio train stays on a very narrow track. Same for this mix with Daft Punk.When you throw Aphex's Windowlicker (again) with Vanilla Ice, Missy Elliot and Britney Spears, the result is a lot more pleasing. Especially when there's a cut-up video to go with it. My gosh, though, it doesn't half look dated now.Someone has melded Aphex Twin with the Beastie Boys and Tokyo electro-popper De De Mouse to produce a track that has a higher feelgood factor than if the entire cast of Glee got pilled up and spent a night sweating and hugging and gurning at Sankey's Soap.Jack Conte has done his own mash-up of Aphex Twin and Bright Eyes, but to my purist ears, it is ever-so-slightly spoilt by the Bright Eyes bit. And the Jack Conte bit. Never mind all that. The bestest Aphex Twin mash-up I can find is this shaky mobile clip of Tim Exile blending AFX and 808 State. If I had heard this in a club, I would have been riding his back in seconds shouting \"ride 'em cowboy\" whilst dribbling all down his hairy back like a mentalist.DJing at its best. Do you know any better mash-ups (or \"mashups\" as Wikipedia would have it)?Edit: As seen in the comments below this post, I missed something pretty obvious. 100dbs take on Aphex Twin versus Snoop Dogg, Q Tip and plenty more is worth a (NSFW) look-in."},
{"title": "Album reviews: Shlohmo's clunky knobs, Ambient News's sepia hue and Mark E spluttering all over your face", "date": "Jan 30, 2010", "text": "Right then, enough about Autechre's leakiness for now. Time for some slap-dash album reviews.Ambient NewsThe recent self-titled album from Ambient News doesn't push the envelope so much as snuggle inside it to avoid disturbing the postman.The busy little beat smothered in vocoders on Moon On My Forehead is as energetic as this album gets. It will appeal to those who like looking at their ambient music with sepia-hued retinas: think Tangerine Dream, 1990's Plaid in simmering mode, or particularly the Feed Your Head compilations.Hiding behind the Ambient News moniker is Cylob, the man who brought us a superb subversion of rave culture in Rewind. This alternative guise gives him the chance to mess around with harmoniums and gamelan-style 'earth' ambience.Ambient News sounds incomplete. If it was BBC Ambient News 24, at the top of every hour, it would have about 15 minutes of newsreaders filing their nails. It's almost as if Cylob had been gathering ideas together for a long time, but never quite realised his vision...Mark E ...unlike Mark E. This hypnotic house music peddler has also been hoarding tracks, but his resulting Works 2005 - 2009 compilation is a much grander affair than Ambient News. I wouldn't normally delve into disco house on this website, but this album splutters quality all over your face, licks it off with a big lizard tongue, then spits all the quality back in your face again.You see, for someone who's made his diminuitive name giving us his take on Janet Jackson and Diana Ross (now there's a duet I'd like to see), a lot of these tracks are a bit too slow, a bit too subtle and dangerously hypnotic. And that's a good thing.As for individual cuts, I'm not mad on the funkiness of Sun Shadow, even though Mr Scruff has been pummeling away at that track like a Daily Mail reader who's just discovered a hammer for the first time. But Mark E's reworks of Slave 1 and Plastic People are house music at its most sexy and sublime.ShlohmoFinally, us IDM fans have been dropped a cracking album from Los Angeles beat scientist Shlohmo (pictured above, not to be confused with the beatboxer with a similar name).Shlomoshun Deluxe is an album of brittle lo-fi beats in the Hudson Mohawke / J Dilla vein. And when I say lo-fi, I'm not kidding. He plugged a mic into his laptop, along with his dad's ancient Jupiter 6 (an old Roland synth with clunky knobs) and, somehow, expected to produce a good album..He did: it's my favourite album this week. The emphasis is all on the groove, and it has a David Holmes wideness to it - which is a remarkable achievement considering he made the whole thing from sellotape, string, splittle and sausages. Well, maybe not the sausages."},
{"title": "Autechre's Oversteps: fake leak scandal and a cellarful of gibbons", "date": "Jan 27, 2010", "text": "(Edit: see the comments on this post for a link to the real Autechre leak. Meanwhile, read about the February 2010 release of the album here.)For a few giddy moments last night, I held in my hairy hands Autechre's glistening new album, Oversteps.I wrote a brilliant review which described the album as a meistewerk: surprising, disorientating, devastating and effective. My writing was so brilliant, Shakespeare would have drooled on his ruff.And yet, one of my hundred gibbon researchers leant close to me later in the evening and said, \"Fats, it's a fake. The album leak is a fake.\"I was devastated. I punched him hard in the face and sent him to back to his damp cellar without a banana.Deflating balloon farts Oh how the review trilled. I spoke of chiming frequency modulation, a playful whirr of whistles and bleeps like a pissed-up R2D2, ambient interludes effusing cold isolation and creeping horror, staccato hits that sounded like lip smacking or a deflating balloon fart.It turns out the album, discovered by many people on file-sharing site Soulseek, was the eponymous debut by Altered:Carbon and was set for release on February 7th. The band are relative unknowns and, yes, they do sound a bit like Autechre.To my shame, I went from caning the album on my gramophone to being no longer interested. I careered from simpering love to cold indifference. Just because it was no longer Manchester's finest electronic music duo.Why? It's a storming old-school techno album full of analogue fatness and eerie four-chord melodies. Was it cheapened because it wasn't Autechre? Do I trade off names so easily? Why does my mind work like that?Hooting The clues were there. This was the sound of not-Autechre having fun in the studio, which seemed out of character. It was a move by not-Autechre towards solid beats and structure rather than difficult algorithms, which should have set alarm bells hooting.But the biggest clue was in this not-Autechre album feeling much more part of a wider musical landscape than the usual, isolationist Autechre beloved of purists: a synth chime borrowed from In Sides-era Orbital; Windowlicker drum stabs; more than a brace of head-nods to Plaid.If Altered:Carbon deliberately leaked the album pretending to be Autechre, they are reprehensible and should be sent into the corner of electronica.Knock-down ginger But I suspect it was some wag playing the online version of knock-down ginger to tease uber-earnest techno fans. I hope a new band gets a splatterful of extra listeners through this bizarre publicity.Unless, of course, Altered:Carbon are Autechre in disguise. Ooooh, my head hurts. I leave this blog post saddened at my own fickleness. I'm off downstairs to shoot all the gibbons.Get Altered:Carbon via creative commons label Section 27 when it comes out. Meanwhile, the best way of hearing Autechre's Oversteps is is by pre-ordering it now. While you're at it, read my other Autechre writings.(Thanks to Rob for making this post possible in a way I didn't quite expect.)"},

Listen to loads of Babe stuff on Tumblr.Achy breaky heartLast week, Warp Records founder Steve Beckett announced to an astonished media that he was, in fact, Miley Cyrus.

Extinct. Its tongue is lolling. It has crosses for eyes. The album is exactly six feet lower than the soles of your shoes. It is dead.Simon Cowell's bungalow This is nothing to do with the much-fondled arguments about unbundled mp3s and the like. Everyone knows great albums are still being made and it will be a cold day in Simon Cowell's bungalow before the general public gives up on the idea of the pop album.No, this is because the last few number one albums have been beyond horrible.They have made me want to squeeze out my eyeballs with my buttocks before repeatedly eating and then regurgitating them until I puke out every last one of my internal organs only to use the resulting colon-mush to smother my ears in damp, decaying human insides because, and I repeat, the last few number one albums have been beyond horrible.Let's look at the evidence. In October, we had yet another number one album from a woman who has the most appropriate surname since James Blunt: Alexandra Burke. This was quickly followed by an emaciated megamouth in red PVC, Cheryl Cole. She may have called Lily Allen a \"chick with a dick\", but that doesn't make her 3 Words album any less noisome.If only she had some tunes, it would smell better.Poor death metaphors Then in November came the idiocy that was JLS by JLS, in which a doctor tells them they are about to die because of an embarrassing abundance of poor death metaphors in Beat Again (\"I need love CPR,\" they waffle, although performing chest-pumps on a healthy adult can lead to broken ribs and internal damage… let's hope, anyway).When JLS lost the top spot after one week, there was even more X Factor nonsense with consecutive number one albums from the franchise's out-and-out stars, Leona \"Does Anyone Remember Me\" Lewis and Susan \"Same Nickname As Leona\" Boyle. Between them, there's more screech than a box set of Saved By The Bell.And so, as 2009 reached its disgusting climax to make way for the post-coital cigarette of 2010, who saved us from such X Factor nonsense? Who, dear reader, who?Sinatra-defiling cheese-mongerOnly award-hoovering, Timberlake-mimicking, Sinatra-defiling, Santa-impersonating, cheese-mongering muzak-churning ice hockey bore Michael Bublé. There is nothing crazy about his Crazy Love album. He provokes fan comments such as \"thats ridiculace, michael bublé is amaing\" (sic). In this Darwinian world, he should not exist: he is rubella / Betamax / Nightmares On Wax's cutting edge.And yes, Bublé appeared on X Factor.The next number one album was Sunny Side Up by Paolo Nutini, a six-month-old album of beigeness that makes Travis' The Man Who look like death metal. And if you think his music exists solely to soundtrack montages in Scrubs and One Tree Hill, you're right, it does.The current number one is by Florence And The Machine and, sweet sweet reader, I don't need to tell you that she's seventeen levels of wrong. The Source are probably rolling in their grave at her treatment of You Got The Love. It least, though, it's a proper album by someone slightly more contemporary than Cliff Richard.We'll probably get our thousandth UK number one album in May, and it will warrant some column inches from geeky Guardian journalists.I can guarantee you, though, it won't be as influential as the 100th number one (John Lennon's Imagine) nor as stylish as the first (Sinatra's Songs For Swingin' Lovers). It will simply be a little poot of air in a vast chasm of nothingness because, on the basis of quality number ones, the album is well and truly deceased."},

{"title": "Karen O versus Brian Eno: the alternative Oscar race", "date": "Jan 17, 2010", "text": "The grouchy Oscars have chucked sand in the face of Yeah Yeah Yeah's frontpiece Karen O and king of ambientronicableeps Brian Eno.It seems that neither musical genius will be allowed to vye for the Best Original Score Oscar gong at the 2010 Academy Awards. Which is a shame for Karen O for her work on Wild Things, my favourite film of 2009.The reasons are dull and not worth going into here - thank goodness Pitchfork have done that already - but this raises an important and probably era-defining question:How else can we decide who's better? Karen O or Brian Eno?Here's how. (Coughs.) Gentles and ladymen, I present the 2010 award for the Best-Original-Karen-O-Or-Brian-Eno. The nominees are: Karen O and Brian Eno. Let the judging commence.Best real nameKaren O is obviously not her real name. Her proper name is Karen Lee Orzolek, which almost rhymes Roland Orzabel. But she is trumped by the ridiculous birth moniker of Brian Eno, which is Brian Peter George St. John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno. And that rhymes with nothing - like orange, modem or Christmas tree. Best real name: Brian Eno.Stupidest album titleBrian Eno may have thrown us a couple of bones in the shape of January 7003: Bell Studies For The Clock Of The Long Now and Lady June's Linguistic Leprosy, but Karen O clearly wins because, with It's Blitz!, she clearly loves exclamation marks whereas the bald one thinks he's above such things. Stupidest album title: Karen O.Best inventorI don't think the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have ever invented anything, so Karen O tumbles at the first obstacle. Brian Eno, meanwhile, invented the Windows 95 start-up sound and is often incorrectly credited with the invention of ambient music. Best inventor: Brian Eno.General coolnessThis is a close one. Brian Eno helped out Belinda Carlisle on a French album. Karen O recorded a porn theme with Kool Keith. Brian Eno works for the Liberal Democrats. Karen O made music in a Manhatten loft apartment. Brian Eno produced Coldplay. Karen O wrote a song describing what happens when you stick your finger in a light socket. Like I said, it's a close one, but the O scrapes it. General coolness: Karen O.Tie breaker: best anagram'Brian Eno' is an anagram of 'One Brain', while 'Karen O Out Of The Yeah Yeah Yeahs' is both an anagram of 'Yo-ho-ho! A heathy Yankee features' and 'A Nauseate Feathery Hey Hooky Ho'. Best anagram: clearly Brian Eno. The award for the Best-Original-Karen-O-Or-Brian-Eno goes to Mr Brian Eno.Now, Brian, can you please keep your speech to less than three minutes. ...Okay, Brian, you can stop now. Brian. Brian! Stop now, Brian. ...Brian, you're just repeating things seemingly senselessly. Stop, Brian. I think he's stuck in some kind of algorithm. Brian!"},

Like licking cats and sticking them to walls.I once sledged in the snow with over a grand in my back pocket. It was a fun challenge and I still didn't regret it, even when I had to dry all the notes by hand afterwards.And so, when I challenged Words Dept to name his favourite electronic albums, it seemed as simple as asking someone to do something as easy as lick a feline or lose all your life savings in a snow drift.But it seems some considerable (and tearful) hand-wringing ensued, and it resulted in this brilliantly creative piece in which a journalist reviews his top ten as part of his top ten, and David Quinn calls me\"the über-lord of electronic music blogging\"which is obviously true, but I'm trying to keep it quiet. The moment this blog gets popular, it cheapens. Like Charles And Diana commemorative plates or Green Day picture discs.Anyway, read Word Dept's Top Ten(ish) Electronic Music Tracks I Like. I am already a particular fan of numbers two, three, four, five, six and eleven, and the description in number six has a strange kind of genius about it.:)When I revealed the existence of a new Autechre album last week, it seemed like I was whistling into a black hole.Apart from a few enthusiastic retweets on Twitter (thank you!), no other blogs took up the story; the internet kept up a nervous silence, as though it was trying not to agitate the delirious drunk in the corner.At last, hurrah and thrice huzzah, that silence has been broken. Autechre themselves have revealed details of their new album.After a launching a live tour, Oversteps will stride out on Warp Records on March 22nd (a day later in the States). It is their first album since Quarastice two years ago, which, if I remember rightly, had one of the last album covers drawn by Designers Republic before they shut their famous studio.The track listing is as follows. Because the titles are as obtuse as ever, I have suggested some rhyming slang to help you commit them to memory:1. (porgy and bess) r ess 2. (stupid flanders) ilanders 3.

In Shrew, he gives us more of the usual Joy: swelling dubstep set to grime up the dancefloor with washes of insistent synths.The EP features a remix by Actress and is probably the best mouse-like electronica since Mouse On Mars and, um, Vole-netian Snares.Flying Lotus / House Shoes Flying Lotus, that hunk of manly beat production, appears this month on a cute-looking 10\" courtesy of the Do-Over crew. On The Do-Over Volume 1, there's FlyLo's Sangria Spin Cycles and, on the flip side of the disc, you'll find Motownie beatster House Shoes with his crunchy soul stormer The Makings.Both tracks are crisper than a starched collar fresh out of the drier, but the best thing is the artwork (pictured), which feels all rather Northern Quartery, cheerful and, well, a bit chick-lit. And yes, it now means I can call Flying Lotus a big flowery girl and not feel bad about it.Keep an eye on the Do-Over for more, um, doings in the future.Pantha Du PrincePantha Du Prince is ready to pounce with his new album and Rough Trade debut Black Noise (as promised in my 2010 electronica preview).But first, a single. The shoegaze influence that once dripped through the sound of Pantha Du Prince has well and truly dried up for his recent 12\" The Splendour.Now, we have pin-sharp four-four minimal techno with a kitchen full of clanks and micro-samples. It is pristine: you can see your face in it. I prefer the dirtiness of his 2004 album Diamond Daze, and The Splendour is unlikely to stick in your head for too long, but it's no less beautiful for that.Martin KempMartin Kemp has taken time out from touring Sign O' The Times with Kajagoogoo (I get my 80s music mixed up sometimes) to bring us a snappy, dark slice of twenty-tens dubstep.Okay, it's a different Martin Kemp and it's a crap joke. This one is brother of Brackles and his recent single After The Night is an uneasy, primative slab of multi-rhythmic 2-step and should ensure new imprint Blunted Robot's place on this year's calendar. Listen to The Shrew Would Have Cushioned The Blow here. Cast your ears on Sangria Spin Cycles and The Makings on the Do-Over blog. Hark ye The Splendour on the Rough Trade website. And listen to After The Night at Boomkat."},
{"title": "Much love from Four Tet - but an icy silence from Monolake", "date": "Jan 9, 2010", "text": "Four TetKieran 'Four Tet' Hebden ambled down some strange improvisational avenues for a while, but he's back on the main road behind the wheel of his perfectly programmed bus to bring us his first album for ages.There Is Love In You will hit at the end of this month. It follows his massive tune Moth with Burial and the spinning, rolling nine-minute epic single Love Cry, a track which waited nearly six minutes to drop a driving techno bassline that would make Fluke puke with joy.There is precious little audio rattling about the internet but judging by Love Cry and another album track, Much Love To The Plastic People, we should expect sharp, driving electronica that has that trademark Four Tet subtlety.If you're not mad on Four Tet, you could do better than get the album for your budgie. MonolakeThat's not the only album worth stroking your speakers with this month. The other day, I posted some snow-themed electronica; it doesn't get much icier than Monolake's recent LP Silence (Monolake pictured).With track titles like Avalanche and Infinite Snow, here's an album that will replace your spine with an icicle and stick your tootsies into a bucket of liquid hydrogen. The droning desolation (eg the screaming Shutdown) and barren voices (Null Pointer's autobot narrator) are saved from being utterly disconnected because of the warm, organic real-world samples.Listen to Four Tet's Love Cry on Stereogum.  Listen to some Monolake Silence tracks on Boomkat."},

I'm no speaker of Dutch (I can manage as much as \"ik ben gek op Amsterdam\", which isn't even true.But the wee bit of information further down the page reveals:\"In maart 2010 verschijnt hun tiende album.\"which when mangled through Yahoo Babelfish, reads:\"In March 2010 their tenth album appears\" Then again, the next line, \"Naar aloude gewoonte wordt daar tot op het laatste moment overbodig geheimzinnig over gedaan\" ends up in Babelfish as:\"To ancient habit becomes there up to at the last moment superfluous mysteriously concerning done\" So it could be complete horse-blouse.

Imagine a Led Zeppelin filled with laughing gas - it floats nicely alongside Bullion's Young Heartache EP from last year.

Miike SnowI may be going soft in the head, but I'm rather fond of Sweden's Miike Snow at the moment (pictured). Silvia is weaker than his usual fayre, although the six minute version is more lovely than a digger full of puppies once it gets into its meandering, kooky stride.Miike Snow appear to be the pop band it's okay for electronica nuts to be into. You can watch the new video of Sylvia on Youtube: no, that isn't Viggo Mortensen.JokerFinally, the mauve boy wonder Joker is producing some seriously good stuff at the moment (see what I did there? Joker? Serious? Oh never mind.). His 2009 track Digidesign has got itself an electro-tastic Om Unit remix, and it has more kick than a donkey can-can. Meanwhile, Joker's recent single City Hopper, on the Tectonic label, is worth it for the slow fat fuzz basslines of the b-side Output 1-2."},
{"title": "Fat Roland's 2010 electronica preview, part two: The Official BBC Electronica DJs In Need Medley", "date": "Jan 2, 2010", "text": "This is part two of my 2010 preview. Here is the link for part one.Writing a preview for 2010 is easy for earlier in the year. Once you get into spring onwards, it all gets a little fuzzy. So here's my attempt at a preview of electronic music in the rest of 2010, but it may look a little like a blind man punching at the wind.April - December: \"boom bang a bang\"In yesterday's preview, I missed the somewhat tribal Nice Nice and their See Waves single in February. But what I can say is, in April they will give us Extra Wow, an album advertised by their label as a \"sprawling psychedelic monolith.\" I also missed Soma 2010, the Glaswegian techno label's slightly delayed annual compilation bonanza.Flying Lotus's DJ Kicks CD, mentioned yesterday, should get an mid-April release. Meanwhile, in May, Venetian Snares will win the Eurovision song contest with his version of Boom Bang A Bang. Okay, I lied about that bit.As summer bears its sweaty heat down upon us, you should go and see Orbital: they'll be touring again, in particular at the Isle Of Wight festival in the middle of June.LFO collaborator Bjork will appear on the soundtrack to summer 2010’s guaranteed blockbuster movie Moomins And The Comet Chase. Yep. That’s right. The Moomins. Imagine Moon, but replace all the Sam Rockwells with talking marshmallows. This is going to be a classic.And I can bring your more information about Battles. The band called a ceasefire while Tyondai Braxton worked through some solo stuff, but it’s back to war again in 2010 – well, at least, in the second half of 2010 when their new album is due.And finally, for scheduled releases in 2010, it's time to get Parisian on yo ass. Daft Punk have been leaking Tron Legacy images on their Twitter feed. The duo have recorded the soundtrack to the film, although it’s not due for release until Christmas 2010. I reckon this will at least ten per cent better than the Moomins film.Other electronica releases in 2010: \"glitchy wonkiness\" Like an unwashed Top Gear fan, I am severely lacking in dates. But this much I know is true:Eclectic 2-stepper  FaltyDL, who delivered Love Is a Liability for Planet Mu this year, is working on a disco album. In less exciting news, \"crazy” beat jugglers The Avalanches are in the process of clearing samples for an album supposedly due out in '10 – but don’t hold your breath.I read somewhere that Boards of Canada have been working on material for three years and it should hit in 2010, but I that’s all I know. And while I'm speculating, Bibio released about 42,000 albums in 2009, so don’t be too surprised to see more material in 2010.Ikonika will be hopping from Planet Mu to the excellent Hyperdub label to produce a soulful dubstep album without all the wobbly basslines. Hyperdub is not only due to release material from London rookie DVA and long-time grime producer Terror Danjah - they're also promising a debut single from a new artist they're refusing to name.The glitchy wonkiness foisted on us by Glasgow's LuckyMe crew should continue to be a highlight for 2010. The most anticipated album of 2010, for my money, is the one by Rustie. Assuming he gets round to recording one. And Hudson Mohawke is working on material with Olivier Daysoul – whether it means another album, we’ll have to wait and see.Expect an album from De Tropix, whose Adeyhey joint has been smearing dancefloors this year. De Tropix is aa London duo that bridges the gap between Prince Buster and Neneh Cherry,You can also expect something from Gold Panda, with his lovely mix of techno wandering and folktronic meandering. Broadcast will produce an album in 2010, following up their amazingly entitled 2009 production Broadcast And The Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age.Oh and there's Manchester band's Everything Everything's debut album too. And the Klaxons maybe. And lots of stuff from the Outkast boys. And Floating Points. And Tiefschwarz. And Beak, a.k.a. that bloke from Portishead.Let me leave you with a final thought from the greatest dance band of all time. The Vengaboys recently started touring again and are working on a new single to be released soon. Their producers Danski and Delmundo have released a statement that possibly summarises 2010's potential musical legacy. The Vengaboys say:\"2010 is the year! Look out for the new hit! It's the most gay song we've ever made.\"Actual quote. Brilliant. That's enough blogging for a couple of days. I'm off for a lie down and a pint of whisky.This is part two of my 2010 preview.

{"title": "Fat Roland's 2010 electronica preview, part one: or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Instead Develop A Festering Hatred For Anything On The Wrong Side Of Easy Listening", "date": "Jan 1, 2010", "text": "This is part one of two 2010 preview posts. Here is the link to part two.Welcome to my ball-bursting, clown-punching, thigh-nuzzling preview of what to expect from electronic music in 2010.I cannot claim this to be comprehensive, nor even accurate, and I am likely to veer off the rails to feature music I wouldn’t normally be too bothered with on this purist blog. But if it goes “bleep”, then it’s probably registered on my radar at some point, even if it didn’t make the final edit.Where shall we start? I know...January: \"it sounds exactly like La Bloody Roux\"Beth Ditto will be shouting her massive gob all over the radio again, this time on Simian Mobile Disco’s Cruel Intentions. It will be massive? Why? Because it sounds exactly like La Bloody Roux. To counter that, why not bring things down with noise experimentalist Merzbow, who will complete his massive but quite unlistenable Japanese Birds series with the final two albums in January and February. (See my original, bird-filled post on that series here.)Manchester glorious bleep poppers Delphic will channel the spirit of New Order when they drop their Acolyte album in mid-January.See him mashing up the beats and then serving them with peas and a steaming pork joint? That's Bullion. Already known for filtering the sixties through his turntablism sensibilities, his Say Goodbye To What single is described as having a “magical Boards of Canada-visit-Studio 54 feel”.Howse about a big name for 2010? Croydon mailboy Peter O’Grady will have a great time as Joy Orbison. He is also working on tracks on Four Tet’s fifth album - and their first for four years: There Is Love In You is out towards the end of the month.Also look out for Miike Snow's Silvia: there's something I like about that guy, despite his unkept hair. Keep one eye out for the Super 8 Bit Brothers, if only to distract you from the energy-sapping truth that William Orbit is releasing a whole box set ('Odyssey') of his pleasing, populist electronica.Oh and if there isn't enough brainless acid mentalism in January, Mike Dred's got new material out.February: \"an ill-fated 22-track concept album\"February is an absolutely massive month for dance music fans. And no, I'm not referring to Josh Wink's Airplane Electronique or Groove Armada's no-doubt snoozesome Black Light album. Nor do I mean The Streets' Computers And Blues, or indeed Fatboy Slim and David Byrne's ill-fated 22-track concept album about Imelda Marcos.No, the 'massive' refers to the return of Massive Attack with what is only their fifth studio album in a billion years. Heligoland will be released exactly seven years after 100th Window, and promises treats in the shape of Guy Garvey, Martina Topley-Bird, the guitarist from Portishead AND a seriously exciting remix project from dubstep king Burial.Speaking of Bristol musicians, production mad skills for 2010 will go to Joker - watch out for his various mixes sprinkling the record shelves throughout the year.Oh and speaking of dubstep, this slightly jaded sub-genre could go go seriously mainstream in 2010. The main contender could be Benga and DJ Zinc when they collaborate with Ms Dynamite in February. Look out for La Roux remixer Skream too.Or maybe the battle for the mainstream will be won by Philadelphia’s Diplo, who has teamed up with chart-topper Robyn (the Swedish Kate Bush, anyone?) – although following the pair’s studio sessions, Diplo admitted “I think we broke dubstep.” Silly Diplo.Hot Chip will make a welcome return in February. Their new long-player One Life Stand will include 70s rock legend, This Heat drummer Charles Hayward. No, me neither.The Album Leaf will present A Chorus Of Storytellers. mixed by a member of Sigur Ros which gives you an idea of the direction of the album, while Flying Lotus will appear on Muhsinah's single Always / Lose My Fuse. Also watch out for FlyLo's other projects this year: his work with Samiyam under the name FLYamSAM and an inevitably stupendous DJ Kicks album.If there isn't enough brainless acid mentalism in February, Ceephax Acid Crew has got a new one out ('United Acid Emirates' - genius).Members of !!! and LCD Soundsystem will guest on electro producer Pantha Du Prince's Black Noise album in February. LCD themselves will release an album in March, although with its rock and disco influences, don’t expect it to feature too heavily on this blog. Which brings us neatly to...March: \"hear it on a BBC ident near you\"Cartoon popstars the Gorillaz have signed up very real, uncartoony versions of Snoop Dogg, Lou Reed and, um, Barry Gibb for their third LP Plastic Beach. Expect it to arrive before Easter.Electronic breaks / trance duo Hybrid have promised an orchestra on their new album Disappear Here in March or April. I don’t think it’ll be very interesting, but do expect to hear it in a BBC ident near you.For the less commercially-minded, there's Gonja Sufi's essential new album A Sufi And A Killer. There is also Plaid's \"experimental Ambisonic piece\" Nord Rute based on recordings taken with reindeer herders. Expect a launch event with Luke Vibert in March.Autechre will feature on the same bill as Salt N Pepa at Bloc 2010 (mentioned here in November). I cannot write that enough. Autechre will feature on the same bill as Salt N Pepa at Bloc 2010. If you think about it, what's the difference? Really?  Tim Simenon will revive his Bomb The Bass moniker with LP Back To Light, while Dan Le Sac and his quick-tongued chum Scroobius Pip will try to revive the good old days of 2007 - they will start March with a single called Get Better and follow it with album Logic Of Chance a couple of weeks later.Does It Offend You, Yeah? have the most nauseating album title of the year. Don't Say We Didn't Warn You will complete their final metamorphosis into being a slightly synthier Muse.Ooo, I nearly forgot Goldfrapp. Head First will be preceded by single Rocket. I have something scribbled here about Tyondai Braxton, but I'm not sure what it means. Hopefullly he will take time out from his fancy classical music commissions to produde a new Battles album.Finally in March, To Rococo Rot (they of big beat fame) promise their new album Speculation will be \"measured\" and \"restrained\". If you want to be as adventurous as Keane, what's the point? And Starkey will follow his 2009 single OK Luv with some more bad boy bleeps on his album Ear Drums and Black Holes, due out at the end of the month.Sadly, there isn't enough brainless acid mentalism in March.This is part one of two 2010 preview posts.

It's a re-edited and expanded version of my provisional list posted in November.This is part three. Check the rest of my blog for parts one and two.Other films of noteThe best British comedy of 2009 was In The Loop, although I think it suffered against a superior TV series. The best US comedy was The Hangover, but it certainly wasn't enough for a top ten position.Sean Penn's turn in Milk is worth a mention, as is the uplifting headlocker The Wrestler. 9 was astonishing to look at and is an essential DVD purchase, while The Men Who Stare At Goats may just be Clooney's best performance yet.As for animation, Watchmen was bold in its scope and is a classic of its kind, while Up certainly gave us the best five minutes of the year when it tracked the courting, the marriage and the loss of a beautiful relationship in a heart-breaking montage.Oh and Coraline should claim the best 3D visuals of the year, but it seems James Cameron stole that thunder in his otherwise tripe-spewing Avatar.On with the final two...2 - Moon\"I'm here to keep you safe, Sam. I want to help you.\"GertySam Rockwell has been mining on the moon and is ready for his imminent trip back to earth to see his wife and kids. Surely the last two weeks of the mission will pass without event?It's difficult to talk about Moon without giving too much away, because it's the bizarre plot that is the crux of the whole film. Is this real? Who is Sam Rockwell? Is Kevin Spacey really trapped inside that computer? In short, there is an accident and then Sam's reality shatters into space debris.The isolation of the moon jumps from the screen in spine-freezing chills as Rockwell gives a compelling performance as a man who is trapped and scared and just wants to go home. The soundtrack, as you'd expect from David Bowie's son, is tremendous. This film is experimental, complicated and effective.I wish I could say more. Just see it. Watch the trailer.1 - Where The Wild Things Are\"Will you keep out all the sadness?\"CarolMax is a naughty boy who ends up in a forest full of monsters. Wild rumpus ensues. Max gets home in time for supper. The end.This is Spike Jonze's first directorial feature since the mind-fizzling Adaptation seven long years ago, so the numerous cinema punters who walked out half way through probably have no idea that Jonze was never going to deliver (a) a standard blockbuster about monsters nor (b) a standard children's film about monsters.Because this isn't about monsters. Yes, the furriness of Max's friends helps fuzz things up a lot, but this is fundamentally a film about childhood - and the loss of it.Empire magazine called this a 'mood piece', and they are right. The plot doesn't matter: the joy and the frustration of childhood is writ large in Where The Wild Things Are. It's so brilliantly realised and uncompromising (you should read Dave Egger's accompanying novel), this makes it the best film of 2009.Max lives in a world where his actions have no consequences, where his world is the only one that matters. He has no idea what his selfishness is doing to his family, and he is on that cusp of having to put childish things behind him - but he can't let go.And so, he joins the world of Carol and Judith and KW and all the Sesame Street drop-outs as they smash down their own homes, nearly crush Max to pieces, punch holes through trees and engage in childish squabbles.There is a sinister edge throughout (the eating threats, the pile of bones, the suffocation scene later on), but it is only enough to keep us a little uneasy without ever resorting to nastiness.The inevitable goodbye, where the monsters howl in glorious unison as they mourn for Max's friendship and for their own hopeless state, ought to leave you floored and broken - but also a little thankful for the short childhood you had.This is part three.

Check the rest of my blog for parts one and three, as and when I've written 'em.6 - Anvil: The Story Of Anvil\"We're gonna be rock stars.\"LipsAnvil were a real band and this is a real documentary following their very real hopes and dreams.Let me address comparisons to a certain comedy rockumentary that was funny to the level of 11. Yes, Anvil has the same kind of down-to-earth silliness, and it proves that the drudge of normal life can be frequently hilarious when small minds dream big dreams. But the comparison stops there.Here are a bunch of guys who had their day a long time ago, but their rock dream remains alive. As we follow their triumphs and tragedies, their mentors and opportunists, you become increasingly aware this is a touching study of ageing and how normal people cope when there's so much to achieve and too little time left in which to achieve it.For those about to watch this masterpiece, I salute you. Watch the trailer. 5 - A Serious Man\"Very troubling... very troubling...\"CliveA suburban family man tries to get by. His wife wants a divorce, his brother is moving in, he has a daughter he doesn't understand, and his son is in trouble at school. So he seeks advice from three rabbis.The Guardian called this a very un-Coen Brothers film. They are completely wrong, because this has all the Coen trademarks: slightly left-of-centre characters, Jewish jokes, small-town mentalities, lots of pot, amazing hairstyles and a script that is so tight, you couldn't stick a shekel between the pages.The strange repetition of incidents and dialogue along with all the references to God, and the fact you have to see this twice to really get it, puts A Serious Man alongside Donnie Darko as a mysterious, symbology-laden cult classic.Don't you want a film to love? Watch the trailer.4 - Let The Right One In\"Be me, for a little while.EliI love children's films. Schoolboy befrends local girl. Schoolboy is bullied. Schoolboy and local girl chat in the snow. Local girl gets people killed so she can drink their blood, provoking the vengeance of the neighbourhood.Let The Right One In is a thoroughly gruesome horror film where the innocence of youth is torn apart by a vampire's bloody trade in blood-drained bodies and residents torn apart in subways. And young Oskar thought he had it hard just being picked on in the playground.It is also a delicate study of love and childhood friendship, in which Oskar and Eli need each other in a world that is frightening and confusing. And the fact that it is set in a freezing Sweden and it has some brilliantly psychopathic cats makes it Very Cool Indeed.Who needs twilight when you can have sheer darkness? Watch the trailer.3 - Mesrine: Killer InstinctNobody kills me until I say so.\"Jacques MesrineThis is the first part of a brace of films following Jacques Mesrine's globe-pillaging career as one of the most notorious gangsters in history.We see the end of the film first, so we know where it's all going to finish, but the ride along the way is exhilarating. Speeding through his life, often leaping months and years to leave us filling in the gaps, we have raids and affairs and shootings and fightings and oodles of moody dialogue.Despite the rapier editing, the film does put its brakes on for one moment during an attempted prison break. As the inmates edge towards a perimiter fence, trying to avoid the gun-sights of tower guards, the teasing tension is absolutely no clue to the massively violent and surprising twist of fortune that is about to be unleashed.It ranks up there with Goodfellas. Watch the trailer. This is part one. Check the rest of my blog for parts two and three, as and when I write 'em."},

It's a re-edited and expanded version of my provisional list posted in November.This is part one. Check the rest of my blog for parts two and three, as and when I write 'em.10 - Drag Me To Hell\"You'd be surprised what you'll do when the Lamia comes for you.\"RhamThis is a silly horror film in which a loans manager irks an elderly client, who then unleashes the curse of the Lamia upon her unsuspecting ass.Amid a raging torrent of modern horror franchises, this film trumped on two significant counts. Firstly, it is quite scary. From the most terrifying handkerchief in the world, to the inevitable but still shocking conclusion, Sam Raimi ramps up the tension from start to finish.And it would be too much tension but for the second significant factor: the humour. The comedy can be quite base (sucking someone to death having lost your false teeth, the staple in the woman's forehead) but it's done with a light touch and keeps the respect for the basic horror of the plot.I feel awful including this in the top ten at the cost of In The Loop and Milk - but this is Raimi on top form. Watch the trailer.9 - District 9\"What is 'eviction'?\"AlienThe politics are obvious. The style is inconsistent. But otherwise, this story of a tragic mis-management of an alien colony is compelling viewing.And that's the point. District 9 really shouldn't work. Avatar has a much better final battle scene, while the aliens really do look like overgrown prawns. And the whole film's rip-off of The Fly should render it null and void for any discerning movie-goer.But it's the sheer emotional pull that works here, on the side of Sharlto Copley's helpless cog in the human system as well as the prawns panicking for their lives. It's one of those few films where you are thrown into a complete world right from the start, with its slumdog sci-fi grubbiness, and you never question it once.District 9 is *almost* the best sci fi film of the year (keep reading!). Watch the trailer.8 - Slumdog Millionaire  \"Maybe its written, no?\" JamalThe rags-to-riches story of a poor-to-do boy is told through the strange construct of a television contest. So what makes this better than X Factor's Sigur Ros-soundtracked vignettes, then?For a start, this snapshot of India (past and present) looks and sounds beautiful, from the sun shining off the tin slum houses to the girl in the gold dress promising so much for Jamal. It is brilliantly scripted, the TV host character is a revelation, and it pulls off the clever trick of feeling like a novel on screen.More importantly, it has that crazy, overpacked feel of a debut feature. And yet, this is Danny 'Trainspotting' Boyle. Is this his best movie since the story of those Scottish junkies? No, because I think Sunshine is fabulous.But it still rocks - Bollywood style. Watch the trailer.7 - Frost/NixonI'm in this for all I've got. David FrostDavid Frost, desperate to save his floundering career, sets up an interview with Richard Nixon, the law-dodging president of the United States. What could possibly go wrong?Frost/Nixon is set up like a boxing match, with the aides of each side constantly giving their prize fighters advice. And what brilliant aides: there isn't a bad actor here, with Frost's sidekicks providing more than a little light relief to counterbalance what is essentially a dry remake of a television interview.You could be fooled into thinking this is a two header. It is not. With the likes of Kevin Bacon and Sam Rockwell in the wings, it can only be an ensemble piece. But it is ultimately about one man's battle against another. The stakes are high, and the added fiction of a dramatic late night phone call from Nixon to the gregarious TV presenter only serves to stoke the tension to the point of exploding. Nixon famously lost the battle... but the outcome in this film is a lot less clear. Watch the trailer.This is part one. Check the rest of my blog for parts two and three, as and when I write 'em."},
{"title": "Top ten best electronica albums of 2009: part three of three", "date": "Dec 28, 2009", "text": "This is part three.For part one, click here. For part two, click here.   1 - Clark - Totems FlareReaders of this blog know I make little secret of my love for Warp Records. So it's no surprise that one of their mob finds itself as the absolute Fat Roland favourite for 2009.But this album is justified in being number one.Chris Clark began with Warp in 2001, releasing a succession of albums and EPs that seemed to get better as the decade strolled on. His sound was firmly entrenched in Aphex-style 'IDM' electronica; it was muckier behind the ears without being too unpleasant.If electronica fans in dark corners started whispering that Clark had lost a little of his sheen with 2008's Turning Dragon, they needn't have fretted.The tentative first notes of Outside Plume on his 2009 album Totems Flare sounded like robots getting up in the morning and wondering what was in store for the day ahead. To be honest, it probably represented Clark's waking realisation that he had to step things up a gear: more of the same was not an option.So the day ahead for those yawning robots was a torrent of yelping synths, snares that sounded like a hundred people clapping, themes piling on top of themes, melodic progressions that will chime a bell for any Orbital fan, and furiously grumpy electro workouts.An mp3 of Growls Garden preceded the album, and is the second track here. It starts with vocals about sunbeams before ripping into the nastiest piece of pop perfection you've ever heard: a catchy choon with a full-on dance beat, all bathed in an insistent brown fuzz. It is the most startling and pompous electronica tune of 2009.The bobbling beginning of Rainbow Voodoo ends up sounding like Front 242 in a Benny Hill video. And this one gets nasty too, all scratches and farting machines, before switching all the lights on and becoming something Mario would mushroom-dance to.But if I'm painting this album as a nasty, snarling beastie, I'd be doing it a terrible service. There is straight electronica too, like the understated Luxman Furs, the acid house of Look Into The Heart Now, and Primary Balloon Landing's sweeping interlude. And that's not all. There is beauty in bucket-loads on Totems Flare.The speed junglism of Totem Crackerjack careers into a tinkling melody and a wibbling synth solo that would warm the frostiest of frowns. Suns Of Temper is a low-down, driving techno track that floats into a thin, heavenly chorus before descending into a bombastic drum anthem smothered in chords that wail like the titular Wild Things in Spike Jonze's recent film.Future Daniel returns to the crunchiness of the first few album tracks before leading us down a crazy-paved path of a ever-so-slightly eighties tune, while Talis, another vocal piece, is melancholic and mega and would sit comfortably with the simple guitar-led closer of Absence.Clark's Totems Flare was a bold statement. You can not only produce uncompromising electronica that rips at your speakers while at the same time swathing you in gentle melodic bliss: you can even add vocals to it and not sound like a tosser.And so Mr Christopher Clark finishes the decade in style. If you want to know what my favourite track title is from Totems Flare, see this post. In the meantime, listen to Growls Garden and buy the best electronica album of 2009 from Bleep or Boomkat or Piccadilly.This is part three.For part one, click here. For part two, click here."},

See if you can guess why I never featured this album on my blog before: he was a Warren G session musician, his album is full of smooth chord changes and all-out soul, and he runs nights in California called Funkmosphere (!).So why number five? It's an electronic album that gets under your skin. The insistent boss drum, the spiralling synth themes, the genius tweaking of a filter here, the acid flare-up there. It's got a simple funk veneer, but scrape that away and you have an album of staggering inventiveness, bustling with analogue synths and vintage drum machines.Quality *and* quantity... and it's a debut album. Listen to this YouTube sampler.  Buy the album from Bleep or Boomkat or Piccadilly.4 - Hudson Mohawke - ButterTurntablist-turned-aquacrunker Hudson Mohawke had one of the most anticipated releases of the year when Butter came out in October. But even though I said it would be \"massive than a horse explosion\", it seems the preceding Polyfolk Dance EP got more plaudits in 2009.Butter was a dizzying mix of the low-fi and the futuristic, taking something as old fashioned as turntablism and making it sound synthetic, forced but accessible. Was it rave? Was it hip hop? Was that Prince?! No-one knows, but there was no doubt this was the defining sound of electronica in 2009.Wrap your ears around ZOo00OOm. Buy the album from Bleep or Boomkat or Piccadilly.3 - Dan Deacon - BromstBromst was Dan Deacon's umpteenth album but only his second professionally released on Carpark Records. It's probably not bleepy enough for this blog, but it didn't stop me calling Bromst a cacophonous bliss in April.I might have overstated the brilliance of the album back then, but hark ye at the frantic arpeggios of Red F, the stamping over Susumu Yokota's legacy with the woodwind backing in Paddling Ghost, and the hypnotic, shimmering Surprise Stefani. It's a perfect companion to that Animal Collective album you've no doubt got.Simply glorious. Listen to Paddling Ghost. Buy it from Bleep or Boomkat or Piccadilly.2 - Bibio - Ambivalence AvenuePull up a campfire and marvel at this stunning debut for Warp Records. Bibio's summery rustic guitars could have sat firmly in the folktronica camp, something I'm not a huge fan of, but instead it ran hurtling around the borders of techno and produced the mind-blowing Ambivalence Avenue.If you don't buy this, you are stupid, You should know that, because I told you in June. The pop psychedelia of Jealous Of Roses or the delightfully catchy refrain of Haikuesque (When She Laughs) was enough for a great album, but then you get the Prefuse 73-friendly beats of Fire Ant or the kick drum of Sugarette punching holes in your record decks.I cannot praise this album enough: it has been a very good friend to me since the summer. Listen to Fire Ant. Buy it from Bleep or Boomkat or Piccadilly.Not quite in the top ten (part two)Why I chose a top ten rather than a top 97, I don't know. But it does mean that some musickers didn't reach the dizzying heights of my top ten, despite deserving plaudits.Moderat, the hugely impressive collaboration between Apparat and Modeselektor, didn't quite punch me in the face enough. Neither did Prodigy's Invaders Must Die, which blew the speakers but not my mind. And Jega's Variance, with all its Aphexisms, wasn't quite enough either. The spacey IDM of Nosaj Thing's Drift is definitely worth a look in too, despite being missed off.This is only an album top ten, so the following artists missed out on a technicality: Floating Points produced some gorgeous EPs, while Bullion's Young Heartache EP took Hudson Mohawke's cut-up style to a new level - and what a shame not to include the eminently loveable track Until There is No End by Lorn.

Such tragedy overshadowed a great album full of 1980s analogue confidence - and curtailed what would have been a fascinating future for the pair.I called Immolate Yourself \"insubstantial\" back in January, but you have to lie back and let yourself be overtaken by it. One moment it is channelling the ghost of the Pet Shop Boys, while the next moment it could be Brian Eno in a cavern or the Human League on GHB.It was unashamedly pop: check the new wave joy of Helen Of Troy. Buy it from Bleep or Boomkat.9 - Lone - Ecstacy And Friends My computer speakers can't cope with Lone's new album, as I mentioned here just a few weeks ago. Maybe my old cobwebby PC just has a function in it that cannot cope with anyone who grabs Boards Of Canada, rubs them up against Bibio and produces a beats album that gave Hudson Mohawke a run for his money.This was Nottingham boy Lone's difficult third album: a lush, poly-rhythmic long player that, t'be honest, struggled to be heard amongst all the other rhythm-reapers of 2009. It's difficult to exorcise the washing repetitions of Waves Imagination, or to brush off to smooth, silkiness of the future party track To Be With A Person You Really Dig.Get some good speakers, then listen to Waves Imagination (Goldies Timeless without the d 'n' b, anyone?) Buy it from Bleep or Boomkat or Piccadilly.8 - Lukid - FomaLuke 'Lukid' Blair's sophomore long-player took the foundations laid by Autechre and Eno and blew them wide open. Foma was this year's first essential electronica album, and it sounds even better knowing what albums came after from other artists in 2009.This is utterly in the vein of classic electronic music (it is the sound of a man playing with his machines into the wee hours of the night). The crunchy wooziness seemed to stretch it out into something new, until the sound was more ambient than a dialling tone. The buzzing anticipation of the first 30 seconds of Slow Hand Slap are better than most albums this year.Have a listen to Fall Apart, and while you're doing that, buy it from Boomkat or Piccadilly.7 - 2562 - UnbalanceDubstep inspired by Detroit techno? This was the unlikely starting-point for 2562, whose Unbalance was a rhythmic, deep follow-up to his much acclaimed 2008 debut Ariel. Of course, dubstep is a tired genre, and this album was in danger of being swept under the dancefloor. Indeed, I didn't even feature it on this here website.But listen! The pounding Flashback was a nuclear missile aimed squarely at your feet, while the reverberating saw bass of Like A Dream or the snapping loops on Yes/No reminded you this was music for the head too. How could you ignore it? 2562's Unbalance was a triumph.Have some trippy Love In Outer Space. Buy Unbalance from Bleep or Boomkat or Piccadilly. 6 - Harmonic 313 - When Machines Exceed Human IntelligenceMore than most on this list, Harmonic 313 succeeded in carving out a very particular furrow this year. By the time When Machines Exceed Human Intelligence came out at the start of the year, Harmonic 313's solid techno sound was already recognisable.Don't get distracted by the Speak and Spell novelty value: there is true feeling here. I rather pretentiously described Harmonic 313 as a \"siren song of a cyborg\" calling from some distant shore. It's not. It's just great subwoofer-friendly dance techno (check the bass on Cyclotron!) churned out by one of the best ambient producers of the past 20 yearsQuandrant 3 is quite lovely and brilliant. Once you've listened to that, purchase the LP from Bleep or Boomkat or Piccadilly.The top five will be on this site from tomorrow... Not quite in the top ten (part one)I never claim this blog to be comprehensive, even though it is subtitled 'From AFX to Yokota'. So here is what missed the list for no reason other than, well, I didn't put it on the list.I didn't include Grizzly Bear's Veckatimest, even though I loved Two Weeks. It just wasn't electronic enough for this top ten run-down (same for the wonderful Animal Collective long-player Merriweather Post Pavilion). Other albums just passed me by, so there's a severe lack of Zomby's Nintendo-nudging One Foot Ahead Of The Other, nor is there Jon Hopkin's compelling Insides album.I kinda got bored with Venetian Snares, so that's why Filth isn't featured. And this is an album top ten, so what a shame I couldn't mention some great tracks from 2009: Burial's expansive Fostercare, Kode 9's excellent Black Sun (well done, Hyperdub, for a great year), or a definite classic, Mount Kimbie's Maybes.This is part one.   For part two, click here. For part three, click here."},

Simon Cowell thinks it's stupid. 7Digital reckon X Factor's Joe McFlurry won't get to number one. So I've settled down in front of a warm radio to being you a live blog of the chart result as it happens.6.31pm: Someone is on the wireless comparing RATM to David and Joe McDonalds to Goliath. This can't be right?6.35pm: \"Don't stop thinking about tomorrow,\" says the stupid charity single that Peter Kay did. This is at number four, just ahead of 3OH!3 and their annoying shouty song Starstrukk with pretend lesbian Katy Perry. Already, with three more hits to go, I feel like ending it all and forgetting about tomorrow forever.6.37pm: This supposed 'medley' (for that, read 'malady') is going on forever. At least we know RATM and Joe McCavity are in the top three...6.40pm: So then who is number three? The insipid presenter fellow has just read out a text saying Killing In The Name is \"just noise\". Surely that's what music is? It's not something you can taste, is it? Right then, they've finally got to number three in the UK singles chart. Oh no! It's Lady Gaga and her \"rah rah rasputin\" nonsense! You've got to love her videos, though.6.43pm: I'm quite excited by this. In a year in which Twitter has defined as well as followed the news, it's a real moment for the internet. I bought Rage Against The Machine's Killing In The Name first time round, and it's as good as anything to stick one in the eye of the annual X Factor Christmas number one stitch up.6.45pm: Radio One is playing a recap of the whole Joe McElderberry versus RATM battle, Rocky-style. They'll no doubt recap the chart so far. Any moment now; just minutes to go.6.46pm: Rage Against The Machine sold 100,000 downloads just yesterday. I'm feeling quietly confident.6.47pm: And the number two single and runner-up is...6.47pm: JOE McCRAPPYPANTS! Ha ha ha ha ha!6.49pm: Simon Cowell, the internet has spoken. Please hand your King Of Slush card into security on the way out. This is amazing news - I just hope Scott Mills remembers to play the censored verson in a few minutes (unlike the embarrassed Simon Mayo (I think) on the chart show back in 1990).\"Always going to be an uphill battle,Sometimes you're going to have to lose.\"Joe McElderry, 2009 6.56pm: The largest first-week digital sales ever (does that count for an old track?) and the most downloads ever sold for a Christmas number one single. Well done, chaps. Zack de la RATM says \"when young people decide to take action, they can make the seemingly impossible possible.\" Bless, he just called me young!6.58pm: Those who downloaded are justified for wearing the badge saying \"screw you, X Factor, your time is up\". I'm not quite sure if those adapted lyrics would scan, but you get the idea. And it's also quite a while where we've had a number one where there's a man going \"UH!\" all over the place.Hurrah!

{"title": "A phenomenally dull post about cataloguing music", "date": "Dec 19, 2009", "text": "Rustle rustle.Chief executive of Corgi toys, £500,000 per annum, company car provided? Hmm, depends on the size of the car.Rustle rustle.Cleaner, £8.50 an hour, required to work in blogosphere clearing up dead bits of old posts? Nah.Rustle rustle rustle. (This is meant to be me browsing the job pages, by the way, not stealing cows.)Ah, here's one. It seems Bleep was recently the lookout for a \"bright, enthusiastic intern\", as opposed to a dull, maudlin one, to help manage their content.That meant cataloguing and maintaining all of Bleep's lovely tunes. As an avid watcher of early 'WAP' catalogue numbers on Warp Records and as someone who still reads The Guinness Book Of British Hit Singles like a novel, this job has its appeal.Cataloguing your own music collection is very important but increasingly difficult to do in a digital age. It used to be that my CDs and records would get sorted into any one of three fairly obvious ways:- colour of the spine;- alphabetical order of first vowel of artist's name;- number of key changes.But now my collection is a lot more protracted, with shards of downloads littered all over the place. I have folders called 'random downloads', 'more random downloads' and 'I think I downloaded these while drunk'.So how do I order things now? By file size? By the time it took to download? By likeness of the waveform to the Manchester skyline?I asked some of my Twitter followers how they organised their record collection. The public responses were thusly:- Andy Taylor has all his CDs in a \"big bloody box\", so lets iTunes do all the work.- a similar story was told by Alex Hall, although he uses a big bloody bookcase rather than a big bloody box.- Jonathan Anelli asked: \"Remind me? What's a CD collection again?\" This could have been an incisive comment on the development of technology, or he could just be senile.- Richard Holden used to alphabetise his CD collection until he, well, basically got a life. He uses iTunes.- and Robert Marshall talked about Linux and Amarok, but he might as well have been talking about mechanical zebras and jellied pot noodles. But he helped demonstrate a point.Despite my Linux ignorance, the point I got was this: whatever system we use, we are terribly uncreative when it comes to organising our music collection.CDs and records used to be part of our environment, part of our decor. I still have a CD rack with duck feet. You just don't get that when you let your cataloguing be defined by what computer you happen to use, no matter which trendy-looking skin you select in the options menu.I refuse to be kowtowed by my komputer-- er-- I mean, by my computer. My files of randomness remain because it reflects how I used to organise my CDs. I do try and be organised according to these fairly obvious rules:- colour of the mp3;- alphabetical order of first vowel of the file size when written in letters;- grouped by whichever daytime TV presenter I was fantasising about marrying when I downloaded the track.It doesn't look like I'll be trotting to Kentish Town any time soon to join Bleep in their quest for beautifully catalogued data."},

{"title": "No new electronica in the singles chart, repeat to fade", "date": "Dec 14, 2009", "text": "Earlier this year, this blog carried a 'Chartwatch', in which I kept a sharp eye on the UK singles chart in a vain hope of Hyperdub scoring their first number one hit.In the absence of any popular electronica anywhere, the Chartwatch feature became as desperate as it became bored: I canned it in the summer.But I love you, dear Fat Roland On Electronica reader, and I want to have your alien lovechildren. So I preserved the text for you to read.On the first anniversary of the very first Chartwatch, here is the whole dang thing in all its monocolour glory:- Dec 14th 2008: No electronica of interest in the singles chart, unless you count Basshunter's Jingle Bells and Scooter vs Status Quo (?!).- Dec 21st: The only vague bleepiness in the Christmas chart is Kanye West, whose album celebrates the Roland TR-808. Bah humbug. - Dec 28th: No electronica in the chart because no-one has released anything. Aphex Twin has missed a trick there, I reckon.- Jan 4th 2009: Some dirty synth action in Lady GaGa's Just Dance (highest new entry in this week's singles chart) but it's not really electronica.- Jan 11th: This week's singles chart is about as electronica as a moustachio-clad tapeworm called Derek. Not impressed. (Lady GaGa got to number one.)- Jan 18th: With a glut of electronica releases about to hit, maybe just maybe we'll get our first electronica hit of the year - coz there's naff all in this week's chart.- Jan 25th: There is no electronica in this week's singles chart. Simply Red are in the top 40 album chart. I'm off for a cry.- Feb 1st: I thought I saw the word \"techno\" in this week's chart - but turns out it's Coldplay's bloody Life In Technicolour. No electronica, then, in this week's singles chart.- Feb 8th: There's electronica in the singles chart! Well. The Cadbury's advert music. At #75. It's kinda bodypop techno, but that'll do. The revolution starts here!- Feb 15th: The Prodigy bring electronica (albeit commercial dancy electronica) to the singles chart with Omen, a new entry at UK#8.- Feb 22nd: No new electronica in the singles chart. Just Coldplay copyists like Gary Go and U2. Yeah, Bono, you heard me right, deal with it.- Mar 1st: The Prodigy have a second track in the chart this week, which is all very promising: but can we please get Autechre to number one, just for a change? - Mar 8th: As a Stock Aitken And Waterman cover version sits astride the number one position in the singles chart (Flo Rida's execrable version of a Dead Or Alive song), the death-knell for all good music rings loud. In short, no new electronica in this week's chart.- Mar 15th: Still no electronica in the singles chart. Is it too much to ask for a Drexciya re-release getting to number one?- Mar 22nd: Royksopp in the top 60 is as electronica as it gets this week. At least it will give ad agencies something to put in their adverts.- Mar 29th: Dear Music, I am disappointed at your continuing failure to provide underground electronica hit singles. I shall be writing to the techno ombudsman. Yours sincerely...- April 26th: I took a momentary break while I recovered from Broken String's (James Morrison) return to the charts. Still no electronica, although the electro pop revolution continues (hello, Frankmusik).- May 17th: Deadmau5 and Prodigy lead the dance stampede, although I'm still waiting for that Mu Ziq number one single...- May 31st: Not much electronica in the charts, although Prodigy have been sniffing round the edges of the top ten recently and Dizzee Rascal's Bonkers has some delightfully techno moments.- June 14th: Still no new electronica in the chart. What the hell is Bill Withers doing having a hit single? He's not IDM.- June 21st: Two horrific Noisettes singles and not one paltry Warp Records release in the Top 40? There ain't no justice sometimes.- July 19th: Have a look at what's number one in the singles chart.  (I think this refers to JLS.) Seen it? If you're the last person to leave the country, please switch off the lights.- A few weeks later: This item has now ended due to an exhausting seven month drought of IDM / electronica in the UK singles chart.- December 20th: Aphex Twin is Christmas number one, narrowly beating the X Factor winner Joe Something-or-other to the top spot with an intense cover of Gary Glitter's Leader Of The Gang. (Okay, I just added this bit. But one can but hope, cannot one?)"},
{"title": "Will Aphex Twin get round to releasing that new album?", "date": "Dec 10, 2009", "text": "As we hurtle horribly into 2010 and its inevitable poverty-ridden reality of sewage in the streets and corpses littering the post offices, one question spews brutally from our lips:Will Aphex Twin get round to releasing that bloody album or not?I have addressed this before in the posts Aphex Twin's New Album Does Not Exist Now Can We Just Stop Worrying And Enjoy Our Knaves Er I Mean Lives and its contrasting follow-up Aphex Twin's New Album Does Exist My Lying Mouth Be Damned. But that was several months ago: let me offer a little more clarity.Every single Aphex Twin album rumour in 2009 has been started by jokers on message boards. Whether it's vague Rephlex Records links on Xltronic or fake track titles on We Are The Music Makers. That's okay. It's fun and playful like the sinister bears on Donkey Rhubarb, and was inevitable following two years of speculation about the identity of the Tuss.But all we know for certain in December 2009 is this:Nine months ago, as the commercial world was licking its chapped lips at debut number ones from Lady Gaga and Flo Rida, Warp Records founder Steve Beckett gave an interview for the BBC in which he promised a new Aphex Twin album by the end of the year if he could prise it out of Aphex's hands.Those hands remained as unprised as a bulldog's greedy chops. The fact is Beckett just isn't in regular contact with the Aphex and has to be content for the window-licking one to be constantly \"gearing up for something\" by playing new tracks at live shows (see the letter J in Self-Titled's Warp piece here) but never quite spitting out the full monty. As it were.If there is a new Aphex Twin album, it's nestled in banks on his sequencers and, for now, nowhere near the offices of his record label.So in the meantime stick the kettle on along with your scratched Analord 12\"s or your CD of Druqks and wait. Wait until the next decade, because the Noughties have been woefully devoid of Aphexness compared to the 90s, and that once-lauded prolific streak seems buried in the bleepy mists of time.(Picture from NMScene, which has a lovely Burning Man review.)"},

It's called Lucky 9teen and if I was going to mark it out of ten, I'd give it n-n-n-n-n-n-twenty six.Opening with hymnal chords and excitable cheering, the record spins us through broken hip hip that digresses through muddy puddles of jazz and beguiling troughs of 80s synthorama.He's produced more than a handful of tracks with Hudson Mohawke in the past, although if Mohawke's music is patchwork slacks reeking of doobie smoke, Slott's sound is a bit more suited and booted and sporting a sparkly bow tie.Listen to Mike Slott's Lucky 9teen at Boomkat. Keep an eye on the Slott: he's not just making new electronica: with the likes of Dabrye and Rustie, he's busy inventing it. N-n-n-n-n-n-good work.While I'm musing about broken beats (do people still say that these days?), let me point you towards Lone's Ecstacy And Friends. Lone is Nottingham's Matt Cutler and a label-mate of Lukid. He has ripped a few pages from Bibio's sun-bleached book and produced an album of such melodic heat, it will leave your skin cripsy and sizzling like an inattentive beach bather.I'll warn you now though: the kick drum hits so hard, your crap computer speakers will wither wretchedly.

In fact, you've probably been so bereft without me tweeting, you're no doubt huddled in a corner shivering and dribbling.- Rustie has dropped a bomb in the shape of a Crookers' No Security remix. Legendardy squawkbox Kelis has sassed herself all over this track, and her vocals work well with his computer-game take on the track. Having said that, it's the first thing Rustie has done that has bored me a little. (Crookers pictured above.)- The Grauniad has been musing on the death of hip hop. Writer Simon Reynolds places it around the time of Nas' Hip Hop Is Dead, or maybe when Timbaland declared his love for tapey-finger stadium whingers Coldplay. He wins points for slagging off auto-tune, but loses points for using the dismal contraction 'slanguage' (surely, 'slang' would do?).He says:\"I still hear quite a lot of bump and skitter in street rap but there's a pedestrian familiarity to the beats: they do the job solidly enough but they're the rhythmic equivalent of comfort food, reflexively tugging at your hips and shoulders but never approaching the stark strangeness of early Noughties productions like Ludacris's What's Your Fantasy or J-Kwon's Tipsy.\"I think he's got a point, although there's a danger in judging the healthiness of a scene based on what's in the charts. If you took that as a bellwether, most techno genres have supposedly never existed.Still, I think there's a wider malaise: we haven't had a true musical revolution since rave. The Beatles made music fab, punk stuck a safety pin in that bubble, while rave danced all over the eighties' grave. What since? Drippy guitar geeks? Videos stuffed with girls in tight lycra? Susan Boyllocks?- Finally, Eclectic Hermit has come back into the light, smothering us with some Ninja Tune scrumptiousness. Welcome back."},

My radio co-presenter Lee has written an eloquent and nuanced piece about his role with Refresh FM, complete with a picture of one of our legendary wallchart playlists. Also, the Guardian's Comment Is Free has written about me, Refresh FM and the wider role of volunteers. Writer Ally Fogg says:\"Anyone who thinks volunteers are immune from workplace bullying or unfair treatment should think again. Victims of such treatment usually (but not always) go quietly, taking their skills and enthusiasm with them. That is a huge loss to us all.\"Also, Soundproof Magazine completed their top 20 Manchester albums of all time. The Stone Roses debut album was voted the greatest because:\"In our (admittedly unscientific) poll of Manchester-based journalists, bloggers, club owners, and artists, almost every single one chose The Stone Roses, and the album accumulated more than twice as many points as almost any other album on this list. It wasn't even close.\"Stone Roses was my number four, although in retrospect, it should have been a bit higher.Finally, Autechre are supporting Salt N Pepa. Well, kind of. They're both on the same bill at Bloc 2010. I hope they bleep it, bleep it real good.(Autechre's cover design of Tri Repetae is pictured above. It's strangely similar to the original cover of Starflyer 59's Gold, released four months earlier. Scandal!)"},

We're going to ", "date": "Nov 19, 2009", "text": "And so a new chapter begins in radio following the debacle that was Refresh FM.I will be back on the airwaves this Sunday on a late night programme of chilled electronica, downbeat tunes and \"aural oddities\".Cafe Del M12 brings a bit of bleep to the Manchester rain, and it will broadcast on Manchester community radio station All FM this Sunday 11pm until 1am in the morning. You can catch it on 96.9FM if you're within nuking distance of Moss Side*. There is also live streaming available, but it can be limited.Incidentally, Refresh FM is history for me. I expect they will broadcast again in 2010. I worry that they will come up with agreements that tie any volunteers to a particularly narrow evangelical viewpoint. That means jettisoning equality and opportunity in favour of proselytizing an especially narrow and potentially damaging strand of Christianity.This is bad for them, and also bad for community radio. Anyone who loves community radio should be worried about this, and I would encourage Refresh FM to take the better path of agreeing to disagree on certain issues whilst still welcoming Christians with different viewpoints into their radio community. Diversity is the key to great radio, and a much better way of getting their mission out there without compromising their core beliefs.But like I said, it is history for me, and that is the last time I will mention that station's name in the same post as my current, rather exciting radio activities.See you in the Cafe Del M12, live and direct this Sunday night.*Moss Side is actually quite a decent place with lots of stuff going on."},

This is a Mary Jane toking piece of rap whimsy where Lil (can I call you Lilly?) muses on playing basketball with the moon, and when it's played backwards it seems to throw up the line \"without the trousers, we are nude\".Flying Lotus has done his own version of I Feel Like Dying, which is even more blunted than the original. You can hear it on his MySpace page. It's not the first time he's covered Lil Wayne, and I'm all in favour of electronica artists doing other people's tracks.I'd especially like Venetian Snares to cover the Benny Hill theme tune. Are you reading, Mr Snares? Will you do it? Just for me?Back to the MySpace tracks. There's another good Flying Lotus track on there too: Prince is a very short tune that sounds like Mr Ozio dropping like it's hot on a Nintendo.

Sometimes, remastered things make sense. The extra shiny bits in Close Encounters Of The Third Kind are quite nice. I much prefer the 1,400 page version of Stephen King's The Stand, if only for the trailblazing anti-hero Trashcan Man.But what's wrong with analogue fuzziness? You wouldn't attempt an 8 bit version of Eno's Music For Airports and you wouldn't scrap your Minimoog because it oscillates too much.I'm being too old fashioned and grumpy, and anyhoo a major music magazine has already beaten me to it with this withering review:\"Sadly, the remaster is a fiasco. The soft tones of Computer Love become sharp, the wide spaces of Home Computer contract into tunnels, and Pocket Calculator bears down on us like a spiked ceiling in a horror film. \"Equally poor is the remastered Radio-activity, where atmospheric crackles and hisses have been removed by noise reduction software.

Enough said.The scary woman from Human NatureLet the carnival begin. Every pleasure every sin.

At least, I think she was a transvestite - or, to be more accurate, drag artist. She sounded like a heroin-hit Boy George. Wait.

The seaside cheefulness of The Blankout Agreement is a little underwhelming, but spiralling from psychedelia and radiophonic samples to post-rock hip hop in the course of one album is pleasing - in fact, it's frequently scrumptious.The whole effect is like listening to a postcard from a long forgotten era, and you can just make out the words Music Has The Right To Children on the postcode. I just wonder if it's sometimes a little too slight and faded.Klimek also throws an album at us this week, in the expansive shape of Movies Is Magic.It's filmic. Crikes, I've called Klimek 'filmic' before, but that's the whole point of this album. The idea of producing an album of cinematic audio vistas is not new - just ask David Holmes - but this is epic stuff. It's pretty much what I imagine it's like to hear the whole universe at once.Tracks like Pathetic And Dangerous and the fabulously-titled Exposed To Life In It's Brutal Meaninglessness sway and wash against the surround-sound speakers.Others, such as opener Abyss Of Anxiety (Unfolding The Magic), are darker, danker, and much less multiplex, giving this album much more crunch than ambient music often offers."},

But the genre has remained true to itself - and, some would argue, a little stuck in the groove of late.Still, that hasn't stopped leading label Hyperdub releasing Hyperdub 5. As you have already deduced, it's a five year celebration of the label that kicked off with Sign of the Dub in 2004 by label boss Steve 'Kode 9' Goodman (pictured).The compilation features some exclusive gems and old favourites (some of which are on CD for the first time), from the cardboard beat of Zomby's Tarantula, to the heroin-hazed Psycho stabs of Kode 9's Time Patrol, to the broken vocal swoops of Burial's Fostercare (think Maxinquaye flung 68 million light years into inky space).It's the first time Burial's dug up anything new since Untrue in 2007, and for that alone, Hyperdub 5 is worth more than a few of your pennies."},

Sorry for the lack of updates over the past two weeks, but I'm not the kind of person to dwell on this kind of shennanigans.But there is something to tell you. I've been written about by Pink News, which is Europe's largest gay news service and not a publication written by Rainbow's painfully jovial hippo George.The worst thing about the article is you, my dear reader, get to know my real name. How shocking and unbloglike. Have a read here.It's a fair description of things from my point of view. It's a shame Refresh FM couldn't be contacted, but I do believe they tried everything they could to get hold of them.Incidentally, Refresh FM would disagree with the whole premise of my original article on this blog. I was not dismissed for being gay, because they have no problems with anyone's orientation: it's acting on that orientation that is the problem. That's a fairly typical evangelical argument, and I disagree with it.I also know evangelicals who genuinely struggle with their received opinion on homosexuality and would never have made the decision Refresh did. Thank you to my evangelical friends who have had the guts to be honest with me about their struggles with this, and to everyone for your kind comments on my original blog post: this is what blogging is all about.Edit: there is an update on this blog here.

{"title": "Suspended puppies: an absolutely genuine review of Warp20 Sheffield", "date": "Sep 25, 2009", "text": "What kind of skrunk-flapped piffoon would profess to run a blog on electronica then not bother to go to the most important electronica night in the history of the bleepiverse?At the weekend, Warp Records celebrated its 20th anniversary with an absolute doozer of night. Warp20 Sheffield (logo pictured) featured smash-n-bassmaster Squarepusher and a hatful of classic Warp artists.Because I couldn't go (and my diary clash really was unavoidable, like trying to walk past a pedestrian who's swallowed a house), I'm going to have to make up a fictitious review. Here goes...Harmonic 313 came on before anyone had arrived; he was only playing to one man and an ill horse. To be honest, this took the pizzazz out of his set, and all he did was whip his keyboards with a wet towel. A disappointment all round.Hudson Mohawke didn't begin his set because Kanye West stormed on stage and told everyone how he loved Beyonce. HudMo was later spotted crying in the corner sobbing his way through the lyrics of Single Ladies. Instead, Nightmares On Wax filled in with a unique set of tracks alternating between bland soundtrack chill-out and gabba nosebleed techno.It is difficult to describe Squarepusher's set without using the following words:- slap;- krunk;- Ogden Nash;- visible beard growth;- suspended puppies;- Middle East peace process;- Celine.Then came Clark, who took his cue from old Top Of The Pops and performed all his song titles literally. So Totems Flare had him setting fire to things dressed as a Native American and he wore a bear suit for Ted. He went too far with that operation he did on an audience member during Empty The Bones Of You, but at least it was different.After Andrew Weatherall's DJ set, which was mainly him shouting \"does anyone remember me, I used to be important\", it was time for Forgemasters.Everyone who knows about the history of Warp Records will know about Forgemasters. They invented music back in the caves of 70,000 BC and if their music ever stops being played, the Earth will die.So it was a delightful surprise when they closed Sheffield's Warp20 with a gushing rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow. Everyone simpered; it was lovely.Shame it was spoilt by Clark who, now horrifically drunk, stumbled onto the stage as Tinman and crashed sideways into their keyboards. That really upset Hudson Mohawke, who forgot the lyrics to Independent Women. Bastard."},

Then again, after the week I've had, I'd have danced to a farting donkey.There were many highlights between the opening mid-tempo salvos from their introspective phase (In Sides) to the delirious crowd-pleasing Doctor?

Halcyon's heavenly vocals became a predictable 1980s cheese fest, while those keyboard lines in Chime and Impact (The Earth Is Burning) had everyone reaching for the roof.Here are some fuzzy pictures where, if you look hard enough, you may be able to see the Orbital brothers' trademark double headlamps.

{"title": "Refresh FM Manchester: how I was stopped from presenting because I was gay", "date": "Sep 18, 2009", "text": "On Monday, my six-year tenure as a voluntary radio presenter and producer with Refresh FM came to an end. It was not my decision. In this blog post, I will do my best to explain why I was dropped from presenting.I cannot fully represent the views of Refresh FM in this piece, nor can I represent the views of my co-presenter and my producer. I can only explain things as I see them, and I'll write about other people's opinions and motives as fairly as I can.I was not stopped from being a radio presenter because I was turning up drunk. I was not stopped from being a radio presenter because I was saying offensive things on air. I wish it was that clear cut, because Ofcom have clear guidelines on that.I was stopped from being a radio presenter because I am homosexual.To understand where I am now, you need to know how this all began.Brief historyRefresh FM is an RSL, which basically means it broadcasts for 28 days a year on a limited frequency to south and central Manchester. It is run by Victoria Park Fellowship (previously known as Victoria Park Christian Fellowship), a fairly active independent evangelical church in Manchester. You can google the links. The congregation finance and volunteer their time to run the station, along with an increasing number of 'outsiders' from other churches (like me).I have never been a member of that church, but I would identify myself as a Christian. I joined Refresh when it began in 2003. I don't think any of them knew I was gay then: we would work together fairly intensely for one month a year, and we were much more concerned about questions of broadcast quality, guest booking, programme timing and playlist compiling than questions of sexuality.The programme I presented was Theatre Of Noise, a light-hearted magazine-style evening show which was roughly half music and half talk (scripted and unscripted funny bits - and at least, I hope it was funny!). The show was not popular with more traditional Christians because we did silly things like destroy CDs with power tools, but it certainly stood as an odd-shaped jewel in Refresh's crown and attracted listeners they wouldn't normally get. We took it seriously and my co-presenter and I worked hard to improve the programme from year to year. Believe me, planning and presenting 20 two-hour shows in one month is a lot of hard work.Overwhelmingly positiveThe fact that Refresh FM found out I was gay was almost incidental. Almost, but not quite. Although my relationship with Refresh was overwhelmingly positive for all six years (until Monday), they sensed I was slightly distant when I was in the studio. They were perceptive: I was indeed troubled. I had wanted to tell them about my sexuality, as anyone who has been \"in\" for any length of time will understand. It's not about waving a gay flag: it's about being honest and totally yourself. I wanted to be honest with Refresh.So I told them of my unease that they didn't seem to know I was gay, and I realised, as an evangelical organisation, this might be a problem for them.I didn't realise how much of a problem.Refresh FM convened a meeting with me on Monday. I was told early on in the meeting that I couldn't present any more. (They did say I might be able to take up other responsibilities with the station, but this seemed like a hollow offer at the time.) The reasons I was given, if I remember rightly, were (in no particular order):1) a presenter for Refresh is a mouthpiece for the mission of Victoria Park Fellowship. I accept this; it's a natural position for a church to take. Church radio stations hold a tension between being missional and being great radio. But being a \"practising homosexual\" is living in a state of active sin and is inconsistent with the mission of the church;2) if a gay person presented shows, the church would find it difficult to raise money for the station from their inevitably offended congregation;3) they don't want to upset the Muslims in the area, although this reason was not expounded upon. I'm not sure how much they actually believe this.DevastatingI should point out that my friendship with Refresh FM was one of trust and love, and it enlightened my life considerably. I am profoundly grateful for the experience Refresh has given me. It wasn't a shock to discover they held a traditional view of homosexuality, but their recalcitrance of their stance on Monday was devastating and hurtful.They seem to like me, but they just can't get past the \"gay thing\".I do not want to get into Biblical arguments on homosexuality here; I don't want the comments below to be filled with YouTube-style diatribe. I believe God loves me because I'm gay and that She / He has no problem with gay relationships. Some Christians divide \"being\" and \"doing\" gay, and they love the sinner but hate the sin. I can understand Refresh FM taking the latter view (each to their own), but the fact they're willing to devastate someone because of those principles seems incredible - and ill at ease with the Christ I understand from the beatitudes in Matthew 5.And yes, I am devastated. I am reeling. I am fragile, hurt and angry.DawkinsesqueThe 'Christian' element of this blog post may put you off. You may think I was stupid for expecting Christians to like gay people. You're wrong. I would take a Dawkinsesque punt and reckon that most Christians have no problem with gay people. Jesus certainly didn't.I understand it was a painful decision for Refresh FM to take - it's not easy giving what they probably see as 'tough love' to people they care about. But their insistence in the meeting that this isn't personal, that it isn't about me, is based on an incorrect understanding that sexuality is something to be separated from our true being. Our sexuality is woven into us. Even Jesus had a sexuality. He would have expressed that sexuality in some way - if he didn't, then the gospels are a lie and God was not truly made flesh.And so to today. I hope the Theatre Of Noise ends up on a station 20 times the size. I did the right thing by telling Refresh FM I am homosexual. My integrity is intact and I have tried hard to act with grace. I think Refresh FM's decision cheapens them; it's a disappointment because I expected better from friends that I love. I will go back to Refresh tomorrow if they change their hearts and minds about homosexuality, but I don't think that will happen in a hurry.What next? I don't know. I have spoken to Ofcom and also to the Citizen's Advice Bureau, and I was shocked to find out it is perfectly legal (and Ofcom-safe) for radio DJs who are voluntary, rather than paid, to be sacked because of their sexuality. I can see the logic when the law is there to protect livelihoods, not hobbies, but if what I have been told is true, this law needs changing.Gritted teethYou may feel the need to protest or campaign after reading this piece. You can talk with me further at dj (at) fatroland.com. Whatever you do and to whomever you speak, please show the same grace that I have tried my hardest to show throughout all of this (often through gritted teeth or teared eyes!). You will not change minds by shouting at people: start from their point of view and work from there.I have to leave the dust to settle to some extent because my (straight) co-presenter, who has been immensely supportive in all of this, needs to make a difficult decision about his future with the station. I also need to discuss things more with our producer, who expressed his annoyance at the decision in a brief text conversation the day after the meeting. I will speak to more people, to organisations, to those that understand.A wrong has been done and I need to stop this happening to other people.And to Refresh FM, if you're reading this... the Bible calls us to love our enemies. I'm not sure if you're an enemy - I don't know what you are any more because I am still reeling from Monday - but I think I still love you despite your stupid, stupid decision.Edit: there are updates on this blog here and here, and here is the Guardian's coverage and the Pink news coverage.

Boycott it. Never listen to it again.I know as a faithful Fat Roland On Electronica reader, you've been following Kanye's production career with great interest. Well, it's time to do some boycotting. If he's twiddled the knobs, in the bin it goes.That means no more listening to:- Cam'ron- Mariah Carey;- Trina and Tamara;- Jin (that must be the dog from Britain's Got Talent);- Beanie Sigel;- Mashonda.I know what you're thinking.

{"title": "Mixin' ma tunesies: Flying Lotus, Rustie and The Black Dog", "date": "Sep 11, 2009", "text": "I've had a strange mixture of two songs stabbing my eardrums all day. The first is Getting Away With It, the melancholic Pet Shop Boys-sprinkled pop song from Electronic. The second is My Humps, the paean to road calming measures by the Black Eyed Peas.The result is an insistent and disturbing image of Johnny Marr rubbing me all over with his strangely misshapen mammaries. Like being tickled with rubber bags full of gerbils, only in a bad way.All of which is distracting me from some important record releases about which you, my newly disturbed reader, should know. Each of these feature remixes and are 47% more successful than anything offered by an Electronic / Peas combo.Last year, Flying Lotus was basking in the glory of his album Los Angeles when he offered us a 12\" of strange remixes. If you're quick, you can still pick up copies of Shhhh! It includes, among others, a dirty snare-smacking version of Mr Oizo's Stunts ($tunt$ is the most immediate track here), a drastic scratch mix of J Dilla's Lightwork and a seriously widescreen bass-wobbling Promiscuous Girl by queenzilla of the perfect pout Nelly Furtado.Rustie's Bad Science EP (Rustie pictured above) is further evidence this young whipperbleeper should be a lot more famous than he is. Bad Science offers up bubbly 8-bit hip hop mentalism, including a reconfiguration of one of the best tracks of 2008, Zig Zag, while still being breathy and prowling like a robot stalker. The whole thing pretty much sounds like Zig Zag, so if you've got that, get this.And finally, there's an EP from The Black Dog called We Are Sheffield which pours remixes over your speakers until you'll be mopping up massive basslines, glitch techno and warm mellowness from your newly shampooed carpet. It's worth it alone (sadly alone, if I'm honest) for the epic yet moody Autechre remix."},

One live event in front of an appreciative French audience. One take. One man twanging.And it bores the eyelashes off me. It's noodlier than Wagamama, with far too few forays into 70s police show slap bass where maybe we would get a sense of the rhythmic unstructure for which Squarepusher is renowned.I accept it's a technical triumph, but it's so pastoral he might as well be playing a harp.Next up it's a 40 minute digeridoo solo from Aphex Twin, then 808 State on the saxomophone and nothing else, finishing with a huge Orbital opus featuring only Alison Goldfrapp's vocals and nothing else.Actually, they all sound quite good. But you get my point. It might get his new-found Radio 4 audience tapping their loafers in gentle appreciation, but why the drill 'n' bass without the drill?And that's the crux: if it's Squarepusher without the pusher, it's just square."},

My problem is once I start celebrating I don't stop. Even if I go to someone else's birthday drinks, it's still me toasting me.I seriously considered necking some cleaning solution yesterday. The label said 'degreaser concentrate', and the liquid was the brightest green you've ever seen. Like the nuclear rod in the Simpsons opening titles.The theory went thusly: it might make me a little queasy, but it would wash away all the excess alcohol that has built up in my system, so providing an overall positive effect.The only downside would be washing away my intestine and most of my stomach too. But seriously, who needs their intestine? I can't remember the last time I thought about mine.On the up side, I finally own a CD copy of Chosen Lords, AFX's compilation of his Analord 12\"s from a few years ago.Buying a CD makes me feel a little old fashioned, so it's appropriate that Chosen Lords sounds a little dated.

{"title": "The key change: cheesy elation or pop diazepam?", "date": "Aug 12, 2009", "text": "So you're listening to a shmaltzy power ballad because it's the only kind of music you can cope with since you were dumped by your girlfriend / husband / android concubine.The song starts with a quiet intent; nothing too fussy, just a clear melody and a trusty verse / chorus structure. The rhythm section beefs up at the start of the second verse, and swooping backing vocals in the second chorus signal that this is building up for something quite specatular.The middle eight is a teaser. Often neglected and ropy, this turns out to be a bridge into a penultimate chorus that is sung with gusto and a tinkling of extra keyboard.You're in the zone now. That bitch / doormat / electronic succubus can get screwed. You're an independent ballad-listener and you can lift your head high as the melody soars and your heart strings wobble.What happens next? You know what happens nextIt's the key change. The final chorus steps up a pitch, and all the extra black notes are a delight.The key change is the sonic equivalent of that last-minute sprint, of that second wind after the sixth pint, of that moment of lucidity when you realise that yes your life is going nowhere and yes you're going to tell your boss to stick his job up his pipehole.The key change is cheesy elation. Which leads me to my question. Why doesn't the key change ever go downwards? And what would be the effect on those plucky heartstrings?If the famous ballad key change went down instead of up, that last minute sprint would be an exhausted tailing off, leaving you gasping and retching at the finish line.It would be like a shot of heroin and a long evening spent crying in the corner: a cloying realisation that there is nothing you can do about life; it inevitably ends in disappointment, rejection, and your boss sticking his pipe up your arse.The middle eight was a teaser, but if the key change suddenly slips downwards, life would not be worth living any more. It would break all pop song convention. I will not always love you. Shmaltzy power ballads would become synonymous with anti-climax and diazepam.Crikes, I'm depressed just thinking about it. I'm sure there are many songs that finish with a downward flourish, but I can't think of any and, to be frank, I plead with you not to suggest any. I don't think I could cope.That android concubine was a no-good loser anyway. You're better off alone."},
{"title": "New York, London, Paris, Munich, everybody talk about complicated electronica with difficult time signatures and a limited listening demographic", "date": "Aug 8, 2009", "text": "XFM are asking listeners to vote on the bestest song of all timest everest.I don't care. Firstly, I don't listen to XFM. Secondly, it involves other people's opinions.These polls can go wrong, like the Telegraph's 100 Greatest Songs which stuffed Love Will Tear Us Apart down the back of the proverbial sofa at number 25 while dedicating the top ten to what looks like Mojo magazine's greatest hits.And thirdly, whether it's a rock or a dance radio station, such polls inevitably miss out electronica.Yet - and here, dear reader, is the point of this whole piece - writing a good electronica track is about knowing how to pen a great pop song.Orbital once wrote an ethereal critique of body image called I Wish I Had Duck Feet. It started off unassumingly enough, with reedy percussion bopping over a looped water sample.But it then builds and builds with melancholic chords swelling to a drum-rolled climax. It never threatens to be chart-worthy at any point, but it is as a perfect a four-minute pop song as Orbital ever wrote.Their radio edit of Halcyon (as opposed to their long, beautiful sprawling epic Halcyon + On  + On) is also worth a mention too.The Future Sound Of London's Papua New Guinea is probably electronica's greatest pop song, in that it's short, structured, catchy but still unrelentingly electronica.As a pithy pop package, it's up there with but better than Come To Daddy (pictured),  Arcadian, 5:23 and In A Beautiful Place Out In The Country. Okay, some of those are a bit long to be 'pop', but there's something joyfully attractive and self-contained about them.It's not just old tracks. Clark's Growls Garden signalled a move towards catchiness, having used vocals heavily in his music for the first time.So I would encourage all other electronica artists to do the same. Aphex, let's have your own version of Song 2. Can we please have action dolls of Global Communication?And Venetian Snares, you need a bit of glam retro like Girls Aloud, maybe trying out some sassy hip movements in a glittering, flowing dress.Crikes.

I totally missed it when I should have been blogging about it.The south London dubstepper slapped down two tracks with the inner London post rocker to likeable effect with double-A-side Moth / Wolf Cub.Wolf Cub is a gamelan-mashing grower of a tune and sounds like a percussion party in a Himalayan village. It has the comforting sounds of Four Tet (picture by watchlooksee) and that woody deepness of Burial.It's a little samey, so thank goodness Moth is an epic. A light step beat and a standard trance keyboard line gives way to a spacious ambient hymn set to a crisp trance backing and wispy vocals that flutter about your ear.Dubstep heads may not like it, because the Tet-ness of it all lightens it up somewhat.

Last year, my bet for Burial got given a hefty Elbow, although my Klaxons tip in 2007 came wonderfully true.  So here's who I'm putting a dime on this year. Bat For Lashes sounds like Suzanne Vega riding a pretty horse which has the face of Kate Bush. This alone is enough to win the Mercury.BFL's music is indebted to the 80s, but not in as a denim-tearingly obvious way as La Bloody Roux. Who, incidentally, needs to give her keyboards back to Erasure so when I break into their studio, I have something to pummel them with. Seriously. Vince and Andy should have given up existing 22 years ago, when they were still truly different and interesting. La Bloody Roux, for that matter, should also have stopped existing 22 years ago. And she's only 21. When Mr La Roux and Mrs La Roux got jiggy in their south London bedsit in order to create a musically and mentally deranged Alison Moyet, someone should have thrown a great big bucket of cold water over them. Then recorded the startled screams. And sold that recording 22 years later on the basis of, yes, this still sounds better than anything that little dampened La Roux sperm would ever have created in its lifetime.Where was I?...  I suspect Kasabian will be the favourite, although the Mercury's been quite blokey for the last few years and they probably need to tick the chick box in '09.

{"title": "We need a new Mercury Music Prize for people that give a crap about electronic music", "date": "Jul 22, 2009", "text": "There's a sumptuous scene in Danny Boyle's best movie Sunshine where a fullstop-like planet Mercury slinks past a firey, all-powerful sun.For electronica fans, it represents a brilliant metaphor for the Mercury Music Prize: an insignificant dot backed up by a glowing past that is more distant than you think.When the Mercury showered Primal Scream with £20,000 for such a far-out album as Screamadelica, beating U2, Simply Red and Young Disciples, it was a kick in the Brit Awards' union jack pants. That was in 1992, remember, when 20 grand was worth about a billion quid..The kudos reverbarated through the years with Portishead and Roni Size reaching equally dizzy heights. And that's despite the Mercury trying to derail everything by choosing M People in 1994.I'm not saying this year's list sucks. I've filed Bat For Lashes, Glasvegas or (yawn) Friendly Fires into a big box labelled \"shrug\", but I'm sure they deserve their success. You may well argue this in the comments section.But where's the electronica? We've been thrown a brace of bones with Underworld (although never with the ultimate techno album band Orbital), but there's something fundamentally wrong.In a great piece for Bleep43, Toby Frith searches for any Mercury nods for Warp Records (\"the UK’s most important label\") and fails. You could make a similar argument for Leaf.Firth argues it's because electronica immerses itself in singles and live appearances, rather than albums. He's right (think of Windowlicker), but the exclusion from this year's nominations of Squarepusher's Just A Souvenir is criminal.It's more because of the man rather than the album. The Square one (photo, above, from Bangface) became the darling of the serious press last autumn; if any electronica artist was going to be the Mercury's first true IDM nomination, it was going to be him.Except it wasn't. Inside that little dot of a prize, there so many are guitars, guitars, guitars, there's little room for a 303. And, as non-nominated Fatboy Slim will tell you, everybody needs a 303.Maybe we live on a different planet, in a different solar system with Aphex Twin's grinning face where the sun should be. And maybe, therefore, we need our own Music Prize that respects a wickedly neglected genre."},

Ambivalence Avenue has been covered here before: click the Bibio link at the bottom of this article. Bleep says it's like a lost 70s folk record.Here is the rest of the top ten on Bleep:3.  Clark -  Growls Garden (track). Marvin The Paranoid Android malfunctions at an 80's disco.4.  Tim Exile  - Listening Tree. Another debut album and probably Warp Records' only gabba opus.5.  The Black Dog  - Further Vexation. I'm pimping their previous album Radio Scarecrow a lot right now, but this record is darker, frownier and more techno.6.  Battles  - Mirrored. An old one but a classic, described by Pitchfork with this trio of scintillating sentences: \"Marc Bolan is dead. But Battles can rebuild him. They have the technology.\"7.  Diamond Watch Wrists - Ice Capped At Both Ends. This is Prefuse 73 stretching out his legs and playing footsie with a percussionist. 8.  Floating Points - J & W Beat. Best described as bubbly 2-step. Yes. Bubbly.9.  Bizzy B  - Retrospective. A look back at the best of the master of the Amen break. No Bizzy B, no Venetian Snares.10. Moritz Von Oswald Trio (pictured, photo from Stink Finger)   - Vertical Ascent. I don't know too much about this, although I think it's got something to do with AGF.Damn, this Clark album I'm listening to is good. It's like old Aphex Twin a million years into the future.

About a week away from touch-down, the most anticipated Warp release of the year (yes, more than Warp 20) is set to elevate Chris Clark to Aphex-levels of respect and thumping-fist-against-chestness. Breakcore goes pop. Electronica goes emo. Choose your own lazy comparison.2. Er...3. ...that's it.Oh, apart from Jega's Variance, which is probably Planet Mu's most important release this month. This slab of strokable bleepness was first leaked six years ago (Jega has released bugger all since 2000), and now rears its official head in the shape of a double CD. The first CD is more melodic, and the second CD is aimed at techno heads, with a smattering of glitch.But really, July is all about Clark's absolutely massive Totems Flare. I'm so excited, I've even cut-and-pasted the track listing from the Warp website.

{"title": "Jackson was a hero to most...", "date": "Jun 28, 2009", "text": "I've had to rush to hospital when a family member had a heart attack. I've had to do CPR in a desperate attempt to save someone's life. I still get flashbacks about both, so what happened on Thursday at the home of Michael Jackson was nothing more than a basic human tragedy.My heart goes out to all involved, in the same way I winced with recognition when I saw the two princes at the funeral of Princess Diana. We're flesh, we're blood, and we bleed with the best of them.Having said that...Michael Jackson was a hero to most, but he didn't mean sha mon to me. The way he used narrative in his Thriller videos confused my nine-year-old brain. Pop songs were meant to be instant and intense and fleeting, like a magnesium fire.The mixture of fantasy (zombies) and credibility (street fights) somehow eluded my leafy South Manchester suburbia. I was more of a Pet Shop Boys kinda guy.But I admit, Jacko produced some amazing pop music. The basslines and the keyboard riffs on Thriller should be studied by generations of budding musicians. And those studiously-scrawled notes should be tucked neatly into the inside front cover of KLF's The Manual.One pundit said Michael Jackson had many careers, over and over again. Yes, he did, but only until Bad.Dangerous was a plethora of wailing over-production (put that guitar down, Slash!) - he didn't even sing in tune on Give In To Me. And it will come as no surprise to you that Earth Song is an anagram of 'The Groans!'They Don't Care About Us was a little clue for what was to come when he released the worse-than-awful Invincible album. The supposed king of pop couldn't string a basic tune together; the thought of any further Michael Jackson material filled me with a throat-splitting, spine-scraping dread.I don't think Jackson ever saw himself as anything more than the pretty, smiling young man in the Rock With You video. His Wildean worship of youth, set in stone by an abusive upbringing, led to a public and personal downfall.In that sense, Michael was a tragic victim of his own upbringing.But, as another eternally-young costume-wearing saviour of the world once said, with great power comes great responsibility. Michael Jackson's many transgressions, which I don't need to repeat here, were totally unacceptable and were an appalling abuse of the power that he held.As a black musician, he changed things forever: that is a whole blog post in itself. But he had a woeful lack of accountability. He valued his image - or his own hazed imagining of his image - above his duty as a parent.Once you are as big a role model as he was, it doesn't matter how much you waffle on about saving the children and bringing world peace: integrity is something you do, not something you say.As his legacy descends into the inevitable lawsuits and counter-accusations, I'll remember Michael Jackson as a deeply troubled, and troubling, man.He was both the abused and the abuser. He made the best and the worst music in the world. So yeah, maybe he meant something to me.And the most amazing thing I have learnt from researching this post? Quincy Jones' middle name is \"Delight\"."},

But I'm a grown man now, and I am learning to accept that I can't always have it my way.However, the bit of Bibio that is techno / IDM makes me want to caress him, have his children, buy a caravan with him, divorce him, split my CD collection with him, not talk to him for fourteen years, and following his plastic surgery to become the world's first human / camel freak, then sleep with him unknowingly in a one-night stand blinded by drunkenness and a half-watched DVD of The Story Of The Weeping Camel.This kind of shizzle is the sort of shizzle that should be all over the radio. Even if you don't like Bibio (and you should), if you give a stinking damn about well-produced music, you should give Ambivilance Avenue a listen. In fact, if you have ears, you should be listening to this album right now. No, actually, even if you don't have ears, you should give Bibio a listen. Even if you were run over by an angry tractor driver, and all you have left is a spleen, half an eyeball and the inside of your left knee, you should damn well give Bibio a listen.Let the music speak for itself at Warp Records.

Just when you think he's cantering through some abstract DJ Food-isms, he cracks it up to full-on rave. Aphex Twin tried vocals when he sang about milkmen in the mid-90s, and this is exactly the same wrong side of deranged.Meanwhile, music technology geek Monolake (pictured) has taken time out from designing midi controllers (no, please, don't click away) to produce his first new material since the 2006 album Polygon Cities.His new single is called Atlas / Titan, and the two dub-inspired techno tracks are as massive as they sound. The bass on Atlas bangs its fists angrily before the woodwind - yes, woodwind - adds a whole new level of growling menace. It's Autechre in a bloody bad mood. Flip-side Titan is as joyfully dark, but a little duller.Finally, Icelandic princess Björk has offered us many treats on her new album Voltaic.She has filmed her tour promoting her last album Volta, where her vocals soared above the abstract atmospherics of LFO's Mark Bell, but she's decided that's not enough.  She has also rammed in about 92,000 other discs, including Volta music videos, a one-take live set recorded before Glastonbury 2007, and a swathe of remixes from the likes of Simian Mobile Disco and Matthew Herbert.It's probably the most comprehensive album and DVD package ever to exist.

Junglist cohort Luke Vibert, who invent drill 'n' bass, once exclaimed, \"what the fudge is drill 'n' bass\".

A bit harsh, but essentially true. Edit: This bit is absolute crap. \"Not true at all,\" say Rephlex, and, actually, they're right.- Label co-founder Grant Wilson-Claridge found his feet in a club called the Bowgie, which is Cornish for 'cattle shed'. Mr Scruff later made a poster with DJ tips for chickens, dinosaurs, snakes and elephants, but not for cattle.- There are 13 people on Facebook called Richard D James.

But now I am older, less wise and probably a lot more cynical.So I survived this lager-sodden football-chanting ordeal by wearing a pair of white trainers. They helped me fit in perfectly, and I always had the option of clicking the heels three times if I needed a quick getaway.In the end, it was an incredibly good-natured affair. After waiting in the cold without sound or lights for 15 hours, one of the Gallagher boys promised to refund everyone's tickets, and the excited buzz that rippled through the crowd never quite left.In fact, it wasn't an ordeal at all. The crowd camaraderie was infectious, and I think Oasis top U2 in that whole stadium rock spectacle thing.So Supersonic soared like the anthem it's always been. Masterplan had pilled-up Ben Sherman lads hugging each other like they'd just come off a football field. And the band is turning out some pretty decent new songs as well (Waiting For The Rapture, which has the same beat as The Doors' Five To One, and Falling Down, which has almost the same beat as the fab four's Tomorrow Never Knows). (Get the set list here.)Kasabian were moody and powerful, as I expected, and thank goodness I arrived too late for the other supports. Twisted Wheel are dull, and I made my views crystal clear about Reverend And The Makers in this piece here.So, Oasis, I salute you. You were the best rock band in the world when Definitely Maybe came out, and 15 years later, you were compelling and funny. You just need a Moog solo in every track, that's all.*a reference to the opening line of The Importance Of Being Idle. And no, I didn't quite sell my soul: I got free tickets on both occasions.

End of lesson.High Contrast is still banging out the choons, although his new best-of compilation, Confidential, has somewhat underwhelmed the BBC.HC's punchy snares land with a satisfying snap, like a wet towel in a changing room. In his own way, his chord progressions and song structure are -- and I need to whisper this -- as comfortably recognisable and as nicely predictable as Coldplay. He's not afraid of the commercial end of his chosen genre, but what separates him from Coldplay is, well, High Contrast isn't a twazmuppet who covers his hands in multicoloured electrical tape the name of world peace.He could always draw on his hand with a crayon.High Contrast's Confidential is a double disc. Once side of the coin is the sprightly d 'n' b we're used to, such as the skipping, airy Return Of Forever (eighties bassline ahoy). The second half is a whole pile of remixes with some big hitters like Missy Elliot and Eric \"Teaching Madonna How To Make Fame-Inspired Promo Videos\" Prydz.On this second disc, I can forgive him the odd Adele remix because his Utah Saints reworking is a total monster of a track. Again, his downfall could be his commerciality... but it's so much fun..The record label that spawned this Welsh bass-stepper, Hospital Records, puts out a jolly good podcast - seek it out on an iTunes near you.

In fact, I'm thinking of using this instead of my usual conditioner.Veckitamest shimmers with melody. It cuts reverberating arcs from simple sun-drenched songs to psychedelia-infused experimentalism. It is, quite simply, the best album to buy right now if you like Animal Collective and Panda Bear.The video, incidentally, uses no special effects. Grizzly Bear glow from within like human fridges. It's a pretty cool party trick, although the hum gets annoying after a while."},

A ball of shining dust throbbed and burst into an insectoid terror, at one point exploding with such ferocity, half the audience phoned their mummy. A grand vista of the universe, falling like fairy dust on the wide-eyed punters, swelled into an intense three dimensional world of amorphous galactic star clouds. Blue vertical lines harped and bowed, harsh squares graphed across the width of the stage, and dozens of hearts lurched as a black hole threatened to explode from a seething cloud of white light.Murcof (photo by Conny Fornbäck) were no less impressive.Death Of A Forest's horror-film chords drew cold fingers up spines (copyright: every horror writer ever). Cosmos 1 or 2, whichever one it was, sounded organic and reedy then thundered to a grandious crescendo. The thin, snapping beats of Cielo and Mir sliced through the RNCM's pristine sound system, and each bass drum kicked harder and deeper than the last.Support came from Johan Johnannsson, who I could take or leave with his basic string quartet / piano / loops set-up, and Denis Jones, who bristled with beardy beauty as he delivered a folktronica set that was simplistic in intention but full of complex twitches and layered samples."},

This is exclusive. You may want to write the word 'exclusive' inside a ten pointed star in red marker pen on your computer screen. That's how exclusive this is.My journey traced recollections of profound silences in music events...Three music events with three silences: one terrifying, one reflective, and one with its own strange beauty.We started in the cold desolation of Jersey Street, where I recalled a terrifying clubbing experience at Sankey's Soap. Some, um, medication sent my body temperature into a dangerous downward spiral: the sweaty electro faded to silence as my vision tunnelled and I faced my own mortality. I recovered with the help of a friend and I was dancing again by the end of the night, but it scared me; silence has never felt so lonely, especially in the crowded vitality of Sankey's.Track this journey: Why not play Modeselektor's 2000007 with the volume turned down?Our next stop was Nexus Art Cafe on Dale Street. The Christian community Sanctus 1 meets here, and I am their resident DJ. I bed their services with ambient electronica, so whatever is happening -- people chatting, people taking communion, candles being lit -- there is a constant soundtrack of Boards Of Canada, Global Communication and the like. Silence in churches can be filled with fidgety echoes, but when I fade the music in Sanctus 1, the silence seems pronounced and, I hope, more reflective.Track this journey: Why not play Susumu Yokota's Grass, Tree And Stone with the volume turned down?We finished our journey on the balcony of Dukes 92 in Castlefield, where I remembered the days after the IRA bomb. The council threw a huge party here, with 808 State, fireworks and 20,000 party people. Other areas of town were windowless and wasted.  The empty streets had a strange silence filled with unattended shop alarms -- like New Years Day to the sound of Autechre.  The sparkles of glass strewn over concrete made Piccadilly Gardens more beautiful than it will ever be again.Track this journey: Why not play 808 State's Cubik with the volume turned down?"},

I mean... it's a \"sick\" record.The presence of MC Sway (pictured above with Doubleclick and Tobin) and grimesters like Durrty Goodz leads you to think this could be a two dimensional hip hop offering. In the hands of the Tobin, however, that was never going to happen.Instead, among the lightning rhymes, the Two Fingers album is a glistening techno monster that tunnels to the scuzzy depths of synth buggery (on Keman Rhythm and Bad Girl, for example) and claws its way to the hilly heights of progressive big beat (on That Girl) and ketamine-drenched Timbalandia* (on Not Perfect).It feels like we've got back the Amon Tobin of old, apart from two inescapable factoids.Factoid A: Amon never went away. Factoid B: it's not old Tobin at all. Thanks to Doubleclick, this album is truly modern, gloriously harsh and beautifully experimental. Or, in the dialect of the \"hood\", it's somewhat \"brap\", seven shades of \"gangsta\" and it most certainly has got \"da goods\".Innit.* noun. In the style of producer Timbaland."},

The hip hop sensibility that underpinned his debut Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives has been spat into the wind here. Instead, we have crunchy, Clark or Vibert-style electronica, sprinkled with shiny aaahs and swooshes to give it a rather false-sounding heart.My beef is that there are about a hundred million billion trillion tracks on here, and most of them last barely more than two nano-seconds. As soon as your head is nodding to one particular diversion, the CD starts shouting \"next track! next track!\" at you.That's not to say the majority of the beats aren't oodles and oodles better than stacks of other junk out there. He recorded this to analogue Ampex tape, hence the album's title, and you can feel the warmth if you stand close enough.So Herren remains the Mega King Of All The Beats.

Arf!;  - modern electronica was born with the release of the Artificial Intelligence album; - the first release (Track With No Name) was flogged from the back of a car;- they fooled Pete Tongue into thinking the future of music was something called \"clonk\";  - they happen to make some pretty bloody good films (the best of which is This Is England)- LFO used to fight on stage. Like Brian Jonestown Massacre;- the label was started with a £40 Enterprise Allowance grant;- Richard David James, a.k.a. Aphex Twin, is something of a 'maverick'. You'd never guess;- signing the likes of Maximo Park had purists spluttering into their chai tea;  - the early releases apparently sounded exactly like Sheffield, which makes Warp totally different from Pulp, who also sounded exactly like Sheffield... who were, incidentally, totally different from the Human League, who also .... you get the idea.Johnny Roadhouse, the propieter of Manchester's famous music shop of the same name, has finally ascended the stairway to heaven.(That metaphor was necessary by law.)Saxophonist Roadhouse has died at the age of 88.  His website says he \"passed away in his sleep early on Saturday 11 April, 2009. He will be deeply missed and fondly remembered, by all his family, friends and staff.\"Johnny Roadhouse (the shop, not the man) was featured in Oasis' video for The Masterplan. Roadhouse (the man, not the shop) has played with Elton John and the Halle orchestra. Also, Paul McCartney famously hired a guitar from the Roadhouse (the shop, not the man) for a sesh at the BBC.Even Les Dawson hung out there.Smiths drummer Mike Joyce paid tribute to Roadhouse, saying, \"Every single band in Manchester has gone through Johnny Roadhouse Music at some stage - it's impossible not to... Music shops come and go, but Johnny Roadhouse stays. It's synonymous with Manchester music.\"On an electronic tip, 808 State bought a serious chunk of their gear from Roadhouse. Which is quite suitable, considering the 'State were responsible for bringing saxophone to the post-acid dancefloor. Graham Massey pays tribute to the shop here with the wonderful line:\"In the 1970s, Americans would have called it a pawn shop, as it seemed to do house clearances: alongside the drum kits and guitar amps were Tretchicovs and radiograms, TVs and aspidistras.\""},

As I said in this post last week, acid funboy Luke Vibert (pictured with Jean Jacques Perry and a Moog) has tidied up his beats somewhat for the hip hop sounds of Rhythm.Rhythm brings together a handful of EPs released on Japanese label Sound Of Speed.

{"title": "The best album of 2009 is Dan Deacon's Bromst. Here's why...", "date": "Apr 1, 2009", "text": "Edit, December 2009: The best album of 2009 is not Bromst. Yeah, I know, I'm contradicting myself, but hey, this here post was from April! Here is my full and final run-down of the best albums of 2009. And now back to the post you clicked on in the first place...Welcome to the best album of 2009.It's tempting to label Dan Deacon's Bromst as a coming-of-age masterpiece, using my best Wonder Years voice. But it's only his second UK album proper; he's barely in long trousers yet (see picture!).I know it's only the beginning of April, but this is the best long player of the year. Here's why:Bromst opens with Build Voice, which does what it says on the tin, and gives you the same swirling tingle you got in your loins at the start of Animal Collective's Merriweather Post Pavilion. I expected some toytown trickery and silliness, but this opener is reserved, considered, and, dare my pouting mouth whisper it, mature. Its melodic choir and hopscotch piano makes way for an extended fart: we're into the start of Red F and an energetic, almost frenetic speed pop track that loses none of the melody.Are those chipmunks hidden in the chorus of Paddling Ghost? The playfulness is still here, raising a cub scout salute and making a goofy face, but like the wonderfully titled and beautifully epic Surprise Stefani, all the Timmy Mallett-ness is integrated into the songwriting.So Deacon throws us wailing spirituals (Wet Wings), stuttering dog samples (Woof Woof), plus even more chipmunks only a lot, lot faster (Baltihorse), and we catch every single one of them because it all makes glorious sense.If Flying Lotus hadn't already done it, Bromst has made me fall in love with electronica all over again. By the time we're at the xylophones and modem tones of closing Get Older, which in Max Tundra's hands would be endearingly comical, our heads are bursting with rhythm and colour and cacophonous bliss.This is the sound of a musical genius having the absolute best time of his life. The streaming link I mentioned in this post a couple of weeks ago is no longer online, so try here instead."},

Their music is bright, simple and gently experimental, like a simmering Super Furry Animals. Their debut album Tomorrow Today sounds like the 60s, the 70s and the 80s all at once.I also ignored the Mark Pritchard single ? / The Hologram. It's his first release on brand spanking fresh Ho Hum label, and it's had some backing from Mary Ann Hobbs. ? is a dark drone that seems to momentarily peer at you from around the corner.

The result is a collection of brilliant tracks that are so unlike their original source material, it renders all copyright arguments into a dribbling confusion. Watch the videos here.And there was me thinking Radiohead on Mario Paint Composer would be the bestest video I saw this month.Can I have an animal-themed link, please Mr Roland?Grizzly Bear's impassioned plea, mentioned in my blog piece from a couple of weeks ago, reminded me of an interview the band did with Pitchfork last month in which Ed explained a shock Animal Collective leak and offered his thoughts on the death of the record buyer.  Read the short interview here. Album Veckatimest is out in two months.What is a twazmuppet?Tim Footman is a twazmuppet. Comment Is Free writer and Radiohead biographer Mr Footman had asked his Twitter friends to remind him to get on with some work and stop dabbling with social networking. It seemed like a sensible thing to do.

One of those people is Tim Exile (photo: Stephen Pariah), whose new album Listening Tree is out in a week or two.Exile, when he was just known as Exile, had a fearful reputation as a god of techno. Debut album Pro Agonist raged with killer snares and beat-pummelling Squarepusher-ness.Fast forward to 2009, and Tim Exile's Listening Tree is crammed with bizarre rants about spiders webs (When Every Day's A Number) and one-way streets (Bad Dust). The \"dreams of a lifetime wrapped in plastic\" line on Carouselle is pure Mighty Boosh.Squish the fussy vocals underfoot, and Listening Tree is beautiful, intricate, thrilling and theatrical. I just wish he would tone it down. The analogue ferocity is here, but it's on a leash and it's wearing those annoying white glasses worn by people like Sam Sparro.Another album now. And just to show I'm over my grouchiness I displayed on Sunday, let me be sparkly and fairy-like for a moment.Röyksopp's Junior is a magical world of glittering synthesisers and heavenly vocals. It chuckles where other albums growl, and soars o'er melody and harmony where other albums grate and scrape. The album is as middle-of-the-road as you'd expect from the Bergen boys, and it is all yay-and-light where Exile is boo-and-dark. But the production is as pristine as Exile's in its own way: it sweeps you up on a giddy, unscary rollercoaster especially designed for princesses. For example, the sawing synth line on third track Vision One is the most delightful thing I've heard for ages. I could just do without the Air-style cutesy vocals.  Which, of course, brings me back to the theme of this post..."},

Which is funny, because I wish I'd never discovered this godforsaken record at all.David Byrne seems out on a (be-suited) limb set against the chirpy horns and childhood rapping of Dizzee Rascal on Toe Jam.

He told BBC 6music:\"We’re definitely going to be putting out a new album by him. Hopefully it will be this year, if I can prise it out of his hands. It’s definitely on its way.”Don't expect any leaks, though. Beckett has no idea what the Twin has up his techno sleeve, so us mortals in the blogocube won't be getting any sneaky advances.“I don’t know a single note or anything about it. It will be as much of a surprise to me as anyone else.

{"title": "Do you pay for your record collection?", "date": "Mar 16, 2009", "text": "Do you pay for your record collection?Following YouTube's decision to kick the pop stars off its screens (leaving the architect of Kylie Minogue's success in terrible poverty), you took one of two views. One: we internet-savvy media whores deserve all the free entertainment we can get, and we intend to stream our eyeballs out. Or two: \"free\" doesn't earn a living for struggling musicians; we should be paying for what we watch.It has raised an interesting diversion in the battle between the internet autobots and the record industry decepticons. The debate is no longer about file sharing and illegal mp3s. In fact, Music Think Tank sounded the death knell for file sharing this week, arguing that illegal downloads are going the way of the mullet.No. It's about streaming. Which bypasses the old debate about paying for transactions in which a piece of music comes into your ownership. It's a new debate about what you watch and what you hear through the power of Spotify or Last FM..Independent writer Rhodri Marsden put up a staunch defence of the Performing Rights Society, insisting we should be forking out for our music consumption.  I agree with him, especially when you get the kind of impassioned plea from Grizzly Bear where hard-working artists have their new album leaked three months early.So why, then, do I have a large stockpile of illegally obtained mp3s?Well, almost all are single tracks swiped from blogs and file-sharing sites. I treat these downloads as tasters, and often do the old-fashioned thing of either buying the £6.99 download from Bleep or the £2.99 not-for-resale promo CD from Vinyl Exchange.My streaming habits are different. Spotify spins me into a world of nostalgia; I listen to old albums I would never buy again. The past turns round and bites you on Spotify in the same way it does on Facebook (and noticeably doesn't on Twitter).Last FM is another kettle of bunnies. It's the opposite of Spotify, in that it's totally about new music for me. It does, however, lead me into the cycle of sampling illegal mp3s, then eventually buying an album.So maybe, my streaming habits feed my older-fashioned downloading habits. I don't think either habit costs the record industry a penny, though. I still pay for the bit of my record collection I really want to keep, and I would suggest this is true for a lot of music consumers.Downloading can lead to disappointment.  The statistic that the dreary new U2 album was downloaded illegally over 400,000 times proves that, sometimes, you really can get nothing for nothing.  But overall, downloads serve as a valuable way of promoting promising musicians.Get it wrong, and there's much to lose. Dave Allen, post-punk bassist and the proprieter of Pamplemoose sounded a warning that \"what's at stake are the livelihoods of people who work at labels, big and small, and of artists who actually make a living recording and performing music.\"No pressure, then. Do you pay for your record collection? Should you? Am I trying to justify behaviour which you think is harmful? Is streaming the new black? How will Pete Waterman get through the recession?Post your thoughts (for free) below."},

Downloads beat it in the face with a hammer until it was reduced to a bloody, single-flavoured soup.So let me pop you a few quick reviews of, er, two EPs and a 12-inch. They're definitely not singles. They are two EPs and a 12-inch.The first EP can be filed under 'psych soul'. Bullion's Young Heartache EP grabs recognisable, commercial soul sounds and gently caresses them until they're a wobbling wreck of half-hip hop.  It's smooth house that's been put on rollers and trundled into a river. Disorienting currents, courtesy of some nifty compressor work in the studio, spin the music from one side of your brain to the other. It's almost too commercial for me, but it's somehow so addictive. Grab a copy from your local independent internet shop.Secondly, the spacious Maybes EP is definitely by Mount Kimbie (picture above adapted from their MySpace page). Combining the darkness of Burial and the spaciness of Battles, this debut singl-- er-- EP is probably the smartest opening salvo I've heard for a while. Drones and drips and clonks and warm, luscious pads build into something that is quite ominous. Just please don't call it dubstep. Although I'd made a lazy note to write about Mount Kimbie some time ago, thanks to Anclove for properly turning me onto this duo.Finally, the 12-inch. And it's the most beautiful 12-inch you have ever seen. (If you think 'day glo' is beautiful, that is.) Dan Deacon and Adventure took one side each of a garish yellow slab of vinyl and called it the Dan Deacon Adventure Split 12\", Dan goes for speed drumming over a busy vocoder, while Adventure turns in a jaunty arcade game synth workout. It's all pretty ho hum, and not as exciting as Dan Deacon's album Bromst, which you can stream in its entirety here. (Edit: this link no longer has audio - get an up-to-date Dan Deacon link here.)The single is dead, although with those sort of efforts from Mount Kimbie and Bullion, the corpse is looking pretty sexy."},

As Dorian Concept, he slapped us across the chops with a couple of neat singles recently, including the head-noddery The Fucking Formula as chronicled on these pages here.Concept's absorption with detail steals your breath.

Not hanging around on any one loop for too long, he dives straight into the morphing experimentalism that made Autechre's name.Johnson must spend decades in the studio. Every week. Literally.The formula doesn't always work. Mesh Beam Splitter has more noodling than an eating contest in a Wagamama, and after a while it's tiresome and your beard smells of peanut sauce.  Meanwhile, Her Marshmallow Secret sounds like Prefuse 73 waiting for a bus.However, when the playfulness kicks in, it's a different record.  Clap Beep Boom nicks its cue from The Fucking Formula, where the beats are so crisp, they should have a Walkers logo. Color Sexist's bassline has more fuzz than Fozzie the bear watching Hot Fuzz whilst listening to Fuzzbox on a de-tuned radio.The playfulness makes up for the seriousness.

It sounds simple, like the spirit of Phuture channelled through Squarepusher's cheerier side. Don't be fooled. It's well-programmed, gurning, glitterball techno that's as much for the bonce as for the tootsies. It's magic.Other releases now...

Pop Ambient is a blissed-out electronica series ideally suited for curious music lovers unsure of where to start in ambient's sweeping, sprawling, snoring pantheon.It's both uncompromising and accessible, from the opening fanfare of Klimek's swooning True Enemies And False Friends, through the insistent underwater iciness of popnoname's Nightliner, to Tim Hecker's shimmering epic Shosts in Silver. Yes, \"shosts\". This album is recommended for late nights snuggled up to your headphones, your pet goldfish and a bucket of benzodiazepine.Finally, and I'm really late writing about this, I wanted to mention Circlesquare's Songs About Dancing And Drugs. This collection of melancholic electropop took five years to arrive, and some of it (but not all) is worth a listen - especially single Dancers' hesitant funk and pining guitar.\"I'm not sure why you should listen to it.

A cutesy animated kid and his cat warned us to take more care. The Prodigy turned this innocent bairn into a drug-hoovering club gibbon with debut hit Charly. Rave was born, and Kenny Everett, who voiced the cat, died of shock.TrumpedWhile Sesame Street and Trumpton birthed kids 'n' drugs anthems photocopied from the Charly original, the Prodigy retreated into the studio to record an album. Experience was a crap name, and the music, although iconic, became a joke in grunge-obsessed Britain. Still, they proved techno bands could turn out a decent album.BurntExperience was beaten to the Mercury Music Prize by Manchester band M People: the repercussions of this were felt 15 years later when the B Of The Bang sculpture fell apart. Alex Garland, who designed the Experience's cover, went on to write the screenplay for 28 Days Later in which Manchester was burnt to the ground. M People have won nothing since.GoadedOn mid-90s follow-up Music for the Jilted Generation, the Prodge sidled up to sweaty crusties Pop Will Eat Itself to stamp their feet against the Criminal Justice Bill. So many voodoo people bought this album, they became the same establishment they so hated. They goaded people with \"the poison\" and \"the remedy\" simultaneously, which seems like a pretty toothless threat to me.SandwichedAfter D:Ream won the election for \"New\" Labour, the Prodigy did wonders for the sale of Stella with abuse anthem Smack My Bitch Up. The video for this single used lesbianism in a way that only Katy Perry could wish for.  Parent album The Fat Of The Land turned band member Keith into a spiky-haired firestarting freak. It was quite the in-thing to be \"psychosomatic addict insane\". Fat Of The Land was the sixth most successful LP of 1997 in the UK, sandwiched between Celine Dion and the Spice Girls. There are so many potential jokes here, but I'm ignoring every one of 'em.ThingsBetween 1997 and 2008, the Prodge did quite a lot of things that precisely nobody cares about.Ends.So there it is. All you need to know about the Prodigy. They have come a long way since what is offically known as their 'Kenny Everett phase'. The dear old Prodders have returned with an album of nuanced ballads called Invaders Must Die. Like a flesh-eating disease, it has grown on me, and I fear I was a little harsh in my review last week.If this scant biography was too long for you to read, settle for this even briefer biog posted by a friend on my Facebook page:\"Band formed, did stuff, went away, did more stuff a bit later. Shouted a lot.\"Come and say ahoyhoy tonight at Manchester's Green Room. I will be popping on a few CDs for your listening endurance. I have ripped an okay-ish CD and called it Harmonics For Quiet Dogs. I have used orange felt-tip on the cover. If you followed me on Twitter, you'd already know this of course.Here are the event details as published on the Green Room website. I'm also one of the 20 volunteers and, if you're unlucky, you'll see my fizzog on a video. I don't like the idea of being on a video.\"Sometimes…Co gathered over 20 volunteers this February to create the We Were Spending Precious Time installation. People were ‘bought’ out of work, college, shopping, sleeping… (whatever it is they do), and asked lead a journey around Manchester that means something to them. This installation documents the experience.\"The exhibition opens with a launch event on Friday 6 March, featuring special guest DJ Fat Roland.\"I'm really looking forward to seeing what other people did for the exhibition, especially Mr Heroes Of Lego. Feast your surfin' eyes on more exhibition details here."},

(Elmo is pictured above, comforting a friend with an eating disorder.)The actual real truth is a tad mundane. I was followed around Manchester by some dodgy art types, who then documented my journey. The result can be seen in We Were Spending Precious Time, exhibiting in Manchester's Green Room from Friday.Because I'm not one to pass up a chance to slowdance my ego, and because the dodgy art types are my wonderful chums at Sometimes, I shall lend some twisted ambience to Friday's launch night with my first city centre DJ slot for a while.Expect a smattering of Flying Lotus, a sniffle of Squarepusher, and a splatter of the new Growls Garden track by Clark, released at the end of this month but yours for the hearing on Friday night. Do come down, from teatime onwards at the Green Room.While I'm talking art, check out an exhibition I've had a hand in creating.  From today, Nexus Art Cafe will play host to 40 Days Of Public Solitude, where we lock up 40 people over 40 days, one day at a time. They will be isolated and alone, but entirely in public view because they'll be locked up in a window - like Dutch prostitutes.See a live video stream of the space here. Clever, huh?  I'll be writing more about both exhibitions as the next couple of weeks drag their relentless way toward the budding hell of spring."},
{"title": "All that Ritornell jazz trumped by a wonky Shitkatapult", "date": "Mar 2, 2009", "text": "This week's award for the jazziest electronica to come out of Austria goes to Ritornell, whose debut album Golden Solitude is out in a few days.The duo comprise a jazz pianist called Richard and a sound experimentalist named Roman, the latter most famously having drummed with Patrick Wolf. It's a CV that doesn't pump my purist electronica heart.The album is sparkle full of mellow washes, sparse drumming, and sound structures that refuse to be rushed. I'm less enamoured with the ladles of jazz saxophone that dominate the album toward the beginning, and more impressed with the found-sound metallic echoes of later tracks like Disappearing City.Ritornell sounds like the kind of music Nightmares On Wax ought to be making, and I guess I'm too much Roman and not enough Richard to thoroughly enjoy the record.Wonky techno label (and John Peel favourite) Shitkatapult have churned out their 100th release, and it's the best thing since sliced eyeballs.Strike 100 is a triple-vinyl collection of the best of Shitkatapult, and it's all rather mellow. Which is astonishing, considering the craziness this label has released in the past. A number of artists have written stuff especially for the album, including T Raumschmiere (pictured: photo by Kika Da Silva) in a rumbling minor key mode, and The Orb on remarkable form with some serious big fat chords.The stand-out for obvious reasons is Apparat's shimmering remix of Johnny Cash's I Heard The Lonesome Whistle Blow. Not the best track, but most def the coolest.Listen to bits of the whole dang album on the Shitkatapult website - you'll notice one of the tracks is by Felix. I'm pretty sure it's not this Felix."},

I feel humbled yet again because I have more readers than ever. It may be narcissistic to prattle on about my own writing, but I don't get a chance to do it much. Unless you're unlucky enough to work with me. So...Oodles of people ogled in when I wrote a letter to James Blunt. If I get run over by a lawnmower tomorrow, my most-read article in four years of bloggery will be about bloody Blunt.My strenuous denial of the existence of Aphex Twin's new album turned a few heads, while my most read review in February was of Massive Attack's Massive Samples. I say 'review' - I usually end up talking about anything but the album (in this case, sampling the Open University).I love the Moog synth, but I also love Barbie. Can I combine the two?I'm glad you asked that.  Why not get yourself this uber-attractive Moog Doll, featuring the coolest synthesiser maker ever?\"Accessories: jacket, eyeglasses, mini-moog,\" but no Ken. Which reminds me, I have a Money Mark doll in its original box somewhere. I must dig it out and have it valued.There was a wonderful Grauniad article about the development of the synthesizer a few weeks ago. The comments rip the article to glorious shreds, and in themselves make interesting reading for any synth-junkie.What is the future of Portishead?Little birds can be gobby buggers, but sometimes they tell me fascinating things. One of those was that Portishead didn't have a record contract any more. This was borne out by a MySpace blog post asking their fans about what to do now they have left Island Records.They have, incidentally, ruled out 'doing a Radiohead':\"i dont think that were into giving out music away for free to be honest...it fukin takes ages to write and we have to heat our swimming pools.....!!!\"You know we're in recession when bands go blue from paddling in the cold.What is the future of Portishead?Oh sorry.The marina area is getting new housing. On the down side, the planned rail link from Portishead to Bristol has been scrapped even though there is an old line in place that could be redeveloped.And Uphill D's fortunes continue to shine, having just beaten Winscombe B by eight rubbers to one.For more utter crap like this, why not follow me on Twitter?"},
{"title": "The Prodigy's Invaders Must Die: tingly breakdowns and a trouserful of fun", "date": "Feb 25, 2009", "text": "So Invaders Must Die is the big comeback from the Prodigy, huh?Here's what the professional reviewers think. The Independent reckons it's a fairly toothless exercise. The Grauniad reckons they're rehashing old material with limited success.  Drowned In Sound blames the Prodigy for the existence of the pants-poor stag party junglists Pendulum. The Times, which in many ways is the natural home of punk techno, was delighted that Invaders was the \"big, brilliant, dumb rave album we have secretly wanted them to make for the past ten years\". NME.com hasn't posted its thoughts on the album, although their review of current top ten single Omen chucks us the cutting-edge bone of \"it doesn't get a lot more old school than this\". Snappy.Spin Magazine celebrates the Prodigy's \"tingly breakdowns\" instead of their older style \"bratty prattle\". Now that's what I call delightful journalism.What's my non-professional opinion? It's a relief to see a bunch of ageing punksters rediscover their mojo to some extent. But watching The Prodge block-rock their bitch up so many moons since their rave origins... well, it's a bit like Johnny Rotten pretending to be a rebel when all along he just wanted to advertise butter.Okay, they've got big-teeth rock monster Dave Grohl guesting on the album, but that's where the problem lies. Last generation's white-gloved ravers and nihilistic Cobainers are this generation's MTV junkies. That's what the Prodigy are now: a glorious, hard-edged dance act designed for gigantic stages and wide-screen tellyboxes. Which is fine, but please don't mistake that with the punk spirit that gave birth to rave.But let's put the negatives aside, into this little shiny box of negatives which I am going to hide under my bed and only bring out when I am in a long-term relationship and I'm running out of passive-aggressive snipes with which to wither away our fading love.The Prodigy bring a mentalness to the charts which is both primary coloured and full of interesting shades. Punk or no punk, they're one big trouserful of fun, and if that's what you want with the Prodders (and what else would you want?), Invaders Must Die works.To use a ridiculous analogy, if Fat Of The Land was Fargo, and Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned was The Ladykillers, then Invaders Must Die is Burn After Reading. I do wish it was No Country For Old Men, but still, it's good enough for me.Global Gathering is just one of the places their live show will invade this summer.  I will be setting fire to my copy of the Times and using it as a primitive light stick at the earliest opportunity."},

I swear he's digging up the whole nation bit by bit.Oh, that's fine, Tony, you can dig a trench in my garden to dig up some old dead people or stones or shit. Sure, you can bring an old West Country rocker, as long as he doesn't steal my beer or start waffling on about possible Roman walls. There are always possible Roman walls in archaeology. Change the record.What you don't realise is, once all Time Team's trenches link up, which they will inevitably do, the entire earth will end up two metres shallower. Scientific fact. So let's appreciate nature before Robinson bulldozes it all up. Maybe start with Samandtheplants.Sam loves plants. His sounds are so rural on his debut album The Eft, it's almost as if all his instruments are made from bracken.  The songs are the kind you sing in the countryside, so I reckon they have no place on an uber-urban electronica blog such as this.But then, he'll shoot off, like Tony Robinson in an out-of-control JCB, down a strange, ambient, clicky path. It's worth a purchase, because it will warm your ribcage something lovely.  (Hear more of his home-woven guitars and lush electronics on his 41-copy limited edition EP In The Scare Shed.)In other countryside news, Susumu Yokota (pictured) has followed up last year's Love Or Die with new album Mother.Mother has more vocals than usual, but the LP remains in the territory familiar to all Yokota fans: organic, spacy, natural-sounding but always synthetic and controlled.When listening to either The Eft or Mother, stay indoors.  Otherwise, they will have you drifting asleep at your picnic, and one of two things will happen.  One: bears will steal your picnic basket.  Two: Tony Robinson will have the ground from under your feet - quite literally.Stupid Tony Robinson. I reckon he's trying to steal Earth, bit my bit. Robbing bastard."},
{"title": "Max Tundra brings his sesame streetfunk to Manchester", "date": "Feb 20, 2009", "text": "So then, me and my chum packed our party bags and jollied off to a Max Tundra concert.  It was one of those events we'd been talking about for ages.The venue was the Deaf Institute, Manchester's gigging force majeure. We delayed setting off because there were some dodgy lads hanging outside my gaff, and I feared they might break in and steal all my chandeliers and brass candlesticks. We then spend fourteen years in the bustling queue while we spectacularly failed to get a refund on a pre-paid ticket. We then queued for non-alcoholic lager (him) and a diet coke (me) because we're on health kicks.So we missed support band May68.  A BBC review said they \"don't make music; they make addictive little bombs.\"  Bombs are frightening enough without them being addictive, sheesh.May 68 are named after Charles De Gaulle's least favourite month (ask your French grandfather, if you have one). They're relatively new onto the Manchester scene, and they're a bright pop baguette with an extra helping of CSS sauce.The be-masked Wave Machines also supported.  They're Hot Chip-inspired art-poppers from Merseyside who sling their funk way below the belt. Their set had one sparkling gem in the form of Keep The Lights On. It sounded like the Bee Gees and David Bowie getting dirty with Grace Jones.Finally, to the Max (pictured).  I hinted at Max Tundra's trademark stage spasms in this piece back in October, but it struck me for the first time that he is a man who seems constantly surprised by his own music.He will buy an instrument (a kalimba, a children's toy microphone, a glockenspiel) to use once in one bar of one song. The result is a man running around the stage trying to keep up with his own incredible music.So we had the skippy frantics of Orphaned, the speed-freak r 'n' b of Lights, the sesame streetfunk of Which Song, and the bizarre other-worldiness of his \"cover\" of KLF's What Time Is Love.The dodgy lads didn't steal my brass candlesticks. But me and my chum did make off with fuzzy warmth in our guts from Max's melody and deadpan pleasantries. \"Anyone here from the Owen's Park campus?\" says Max, no doubt recalling a quick read of Google maps on the way to the gig.Max Tundra is a definite for your diary next time he's in town and, no, it won't matter if you miss the support band, or if you have to pay for a friend who didn't turn up, or if some robber nicks your widescreen cafetiere while you're out.Because watching a constantly startled Max Tundra is worth every penny."},

Pfffrt. Expect some highly smug tweets as I watch from my tellybox.- U2 are putting all their words on a big screen like a worship concert.- Ha ha, look at James Corden, doing a great Homer 'smock'.- Simon Pegg has kept that weight off.- Duffy best female?! - the clue's in the name.- Best International Female up next, it's... NO NO NO WRONG NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO WRONG GET HER OFF NO NO NO NO NO AAAARGH STOP HER TALKING NO NO NO OH PLEASE NO. Katy Perry's stopped. Phew.- Took Corden 15 mins to do a shag joke to Kyles.- Girls Aloud look like flamingos.- Second Brit for Duff(y).- It's Coldplay - I may have to hide.- Chris Martin came on naked, doing a rap version of Run To The Hills. Didn't expect that.- Pet Shop Boys, Brandon Flowers and Lady GaGa later. It could be messy.- Strong International Group category. It's Kings Of Leon, obvs'ly. Epitome of casual cool, \"y'all\".- Why's Paul Weller at home having tea with Adele? (He was in a pub, it turned out.)- Has Duff(y) finished? Can I un-mute yet? - Joe Calzagglewaggle looks sheepish because he's totally forgotten which award he's presenting- heh!- KINGS OF LEON YOU ARE IN BRITAIN NOT JUST ENGLAND. Gah. - Who are those people with torches? - It's our hometown boys, Take That. Robbie fever! Rumour was Robbie Williams would turn up. He didn't, but Take That's Brit performance was truly beautiful. Mat Horne is having an orgasm at it.- Take That looked like Kraftwerk.- Nick Frost looks like a geography teacher browsing a gardening centre.- Eddie's just killed Iron Maiden.- Matt Lucas knows how to find the camera, doesn't he?!- Hoff and Elbow. What a contrast. Oh as I type, Guy Garvey says to the Hoff, dryly: \"You up for a drink later on, David?\" Fried Brits gold, ha ha ha!- Next bit of gossip: Will Katy Perry \"controversially\" snog Florence & The Machine? Will the Pet Shop Boys, the Killers and Lady GaGa be a car crash? Stay tuned.- They muted Florence's introduction. Hmm. No snogging.- Gok's predictable and receding.- Best International Male Kanye West did a terrible \"inter-racial\" joke. (International. Inter-racial. It's a pun, see? Kanye's no Tim Vine.)- Ting Tings and Estelle's quite good mash-up is more sass than my bowels can cope with.- Did Grace Jones do Estelle's make-up?- Allan Carr comes on to 'Womanizer'. Does science teacher joke - I've already done that here, luv.- Best single Girls Aloud is a major relief.- Tom Jones is a McLaren F1 car (orange and grey).- Right, Radiohead, it's your time to win... go on... go on... Duff(y)?!? Oh come ON. - Duff(y)'s crying. Good. She's ruined all music forever by beating Radiohead.- Stephen Fry's tummy is rumbling - oh the trivia of Twitter.- Took Corden 110 minutes to do a shag joke about Brandon Flowers.- Here's Pet Shop Boys' disembodied heads. Starting with Suburbia, with added pink wig, then Love Etc, then Always On My Mind, then (to a massive cheer) Go West . It's a classic Brits melody!- Here come the sexy men dancers.- The sexy men dancers have been replaced by Lady GaGa on What Have I Done To Deserve This. One second of I'm With Stupid, then Brandon doing It's A Sin.  A couple more breakneck track changes.- Wow, those mostly naked dancers don't leave a lot to the imagination, do they?- Pet Shop Boys didn't need Brandon Flowers and Lady GaGa.- So that's it, done. Elbow had the best moment with the Hoff, Take That were the best performers and Duff(y) was a travesty.A finally message to a friend on Twitter: \"Twittering was the only way of coping with the awfulness.\" See my Twitter page here.Twitter is by no means the saviour of the world, but it's a good excuse to send some 140-character bitchin' into the atmosphere.I will be 'live tweeting' the 2009 Brit Awards, which should mean about a dozen pious comments over the two hour show, from 8pm tonight.Yes, I know it's short notice, but I really wasn't expecting to get a night in to do this.

Its re-release sits neatly in our Twitterfied world of dubstep and glitch, like a cool grandpops who knows how to get out of his threadbare chair and get down with the kids.The best track on After The Heat is The Belldog.  It has a synthy bass which circles and circles, building a huge sense of foreboding, and also because of its 70s analogueness, makes the whole track sound like the Airwolf pilots getting stoned.Which brings me, finally, to another old master.  Merzbow has released the first volume of his 13 Japanese Birds series, as written about so eloquently here on my site.If you can stomach 20 minute tracks of frenetic precision drumming and bustling distortion, then you're a greater person than me. I'm just thrilled he called one track Fandangos In Space.  I want to have a fandango in space.  Can someone arrange that, please?Did you see my horse-shout?  It's in the first paragraph of this post.  I told you it'd be when you least expect it.  I'm clever, me."},

Or whether they're vulnerable and fearful in a society that ought to respect people's freedom of speech, even if their views are hurtful and repulsive.Do you recall the years after Thatcher (you remember Thatcher: she's the mother of the BBC's least favourite celebrity since Jonathan Ross, Jeremy Clarkson and, um, the DEC)?  In the early 1990s, for a generation of young people politicised by the poll tax riots, it was especially cool to bash racism with music.Some artists waved the flag higher than others. Reggae trance soundsystem Dreadzone (pictured) woke the zion youth and encouraged them to Fight The Power. Credit To The Nation sampled Nirvana with protest single Call It What You Want, and we all learned that (a) racism was wrong and (b) sampling had gone too far.And Phil Collins threatened to leave the country if the left-wingers gained power. (They never did, because Collins and his ilk secretly infiltrated the Labour party with a drumming gorilla, or something.)I still have Anti-Nazi League stickers on old notebooks somewhere.  The notebooks are full of appalling song lyrics that will never again see the light of day.Since then, we've forgotten how to be political through music. Yes, protest songs live on, and plenty of musicians rouse the Citizen Smith within us. But Bono made the whole thing a little maudlin, while Morrissey's revived spat with the NME left both parties looking more than a little pathetic.Politics seems to be hiding in the wings when it should be centre stage.  There is plenty to be political about.  The BNP keep winning seats for their disgusting cause, the red-top dailies prey on people's fears, and the pay gap continues to drive a chasm betwixt all different sorts of people.  It's pretty disingenuous of me to turn a piece about racism into an exercise in nostalgia.  But I wish we could regain that spark.  Make Chumbawamba cool again.

It's the disturbance you get on the edges of hip hop; the fuzzy lines at the side of your vision.A Speak and Spell machine is the gimmick, but in the android hands of Harmonic 313, it becomes something more sinister.  The desolation rips through me, like someone has whipped the bottom end of my spine and sent a shockwave up into my cold, cold brain.When Machines Exceed Human Intelligence works better when things are kept simple. Like mashed potato. So we don't need the rapping that appears in small doses. Like mashed potato. I hate mashed potato with raps. Hey, Vanilla Ice, get out of my mash. That's what I'd say.This absurdly cadillac-themed Harmonic 313 tribute on Hipsterwave amused me no end. It seemed non-sequitur. I have been getting friends to post non-sequitur comments on this Aphex video (edit: some bugger deleted them) - please join in.Where was I?  Oh yes, 313 words.  Just enough remaining to say Harmonic 313's When Machines Exceed Human Intelligence can be bought from Piccadilly, Boomkat or Bleep."},
{"title": "Telefon Tel Aviv's big hair sound is shrouded in darkness", "date": "Feb 6, 2009", "text": "Edit: This album is mentioned in my top ten electronica albums of 2009. I want to describe Telefon Tel Aviv's new album, heralded as something to watch in my 2009 preview, as a collection of \"driving pop anthems.\"Don't get me wrong: they're not the Pet Shop Boys. They're not singing glorious ditties about naughty sex for a start. But there's something super-electro-pop about Telefon's third album, titled Immolate Yourself.Spiralling opener The Birds' punches the air with eighties snares, an energetic stadium keyboard line and breathy vocals. Helen Of Troy should have its own big hair video and rolled up jacket sleeves..  Stay Away From Being Maybe steals the bassline from Bill Withers' Lovely Day and fires it into space.  Yet, it's all muzzled and shrouded in dark contemplation.The deeper you push into the album, the more their sound hits a more familiar skewy electronica beat, with layer upon layer of melodies that ultimately lead nowhere. And that's the flaw with Telefon Tel Aviv. The production sparkles, the new nods to bands like Kraftwerk are a massive improvement, but they're never going to hit you in the face like, for example, Apparat or Wisp.It's insubstantial... but it's a really pleasing, cotton wool, uplifting, dark and wet insubstantial.And so to the electronic elephant in the room: the death of one half of Telefon Tel Aviv.  Charlie Cooper (in yellow, above) went missing after an argument with his girlfriend, but beyond that, the details are sketchy. They should stay sketchy in respect to his family and friends.If this is the end of Telefon Tel Aviv, then Immolate Yourself is the sound of a band reaching their suitably melancholic climax. In the words of one commenter on Telefon's Myspace page, the \"group put New Orleans (and the US in general) on the IDM map. Heck of an accomplishment.\"IDM, for the uninitiated, is the name for most of the music you read about on this blog. And its historic connection with New Orleans is, well, zilch. It has been a British-led genre, so you could say America doesn't \"do\" IDM.Except, it did. And for a while at least, its name was Telefon Tel Aviv.I wrote a letter to James Blunt proffering my expert advice on how he could improve his career prospects.I got a reply.  And honestly, I feel like I've waited for my hero, autograph pad in hand, through rain and cold, and upon arrival he's just swished past into the stage entrance without a by or leave.Dear Fat Roland,Unfortunately due to James busy touring schedule he is unable to reply personally, however all messages will be passed on to his house for him to read on his return.Kind regards,Twenty-First Artists.So he has my advice. His cleaner is probably reading it. Apparently he's travelling across Mexico on a horse at the moment, but I see he's due to play Moscow, so I hope he'll stop by his Ibizan pad to pick up his messages some time next week.Read my Dear James Blunt letter.  Any ideas on what he'll say?  Personally, I think he'll be delighted.  Post your thoughts in the comments."},

Your last three singles, which the BBC lovingly described as \"catchy and uplifting, in a Chris-Martin-on-an-off-day kinda way\", have reached numbers four, 57 and 20 respectively. I would have thought if these chart positions befell Girls Aloud, KitKat's sponsorship moguls would be spluttering into their sugary tea.May I offer a suggestion that would help return you back up the greasy pole of fame?These days, it's all about chicks with synths.  Trust me on this: I have my finger on the pulse of modern whims. Lady Gaga is a chick with a synth.  La Roux is a chick with a synth. Britney Spears is a chick with a synth (that is, assuming \"synth\" is rural states slang for a snaffled bag of Bic razors).You need to have a synth. You need to buy a nice shiny silver synthesiser and get it into every publicity shot you can.You don't have to play it yourself:. Maybe smuggle in a synth pop legend such as Gary Numan, Adamski or Richard Clayderman to tinkle the electronic ivories for you.  Then mime playing, as though it's your big new thing.  \"Look, there's James Blunt, and he's a keyboard wizard,\" people would say, and they would point.  People would point at you, although this time it would be in admiration.You should do this.  Become a chick with a synth.  Every single would go to number one.Which leads me to one last thing.  You will, of course, need to alter your gender.  I am quite happy to offer my services.  I once cut the leg off a teddy bear with my dad's nosehair clippers, and I'm sure changing your sex wouldn't be much different.I still have the nosehair clippers.It wouldn't be pervy or anything. I have no desire to see you naked; I think we had quite enough of that in your 2005 smash hit video I'm Quite Beautiful.  One quick snip, maybe a bit of a push-in with a sink plunger, and we can leave matron to mop up the blood.Just let me know.Yours sincerely,Fat Roland"},
{"title": "Massive Attack sampled a sewer designer? This must be Massive Samples then", "date": "Feb 2, 2009", "text": "The advent of the sampler in electronic music gave us geeky music enthusiasts our own special game: see if you can find the original bits of audio used in sample-heavy records.Some samples are well documented, such as the Utah Saints' ripping of Kate Bush's Cloudbusting. And the shuffling Soul II Soul drum beat was copied by every dance band from here to eternity.But every now and then random bits of sampleness jump out and mug your brains out.  Orbital's seminal record The Brown Album, which is topped and tailed by sampled voices, is a case in point.I nearly spat out my cleaning fluid while watching Withnail And I, when the-one-who-isn't-Richard-E-Grant posited that \"even a stopped clock tells the right time twice a day\". That phrase, sampled menacingly near the start of the Brown Album, had been on repeat on my CD player for years. Following the sample on the Orbital record, a lazer then jumps out from the speakers.  No zapping befell McGann in the film; just abject hopelessness.And once, I was watching a late night Open University progamme (brown jumpers, big collars, scribbly hair) about how squeegee mops work. The droll presenter explained it was \"input translation, output rotation\".  Again, that was used on the same Orbital album, and I couldn't believe my ears.  It was definitely the same voice, and I was spooked for weeks.This is a long way of going about introducing Massive Attack's new album (band logo pictured).  Protected - Massive Samples spoils the game a bit because it's a compilation of the songs the band has sampled and covered.And so we have, in order: Level 42's mate Wally Badarou; soul singer Lowrell; sewer designer (and musician) William De Vaughn; the very reverend Al Green; every lawyer's friend James Brown; ex-Chef Isaac Hayes; jazz fusion drummer Billy Cobham; Lewin Bones Lock (never heard of 'im); slushy reggae legend John Holt; Blue Note-spawned 70s soulsters The Blackbyrds; jazz fusion group Pieces Of A Dream (who appeared on an astonishingly-titled album The Weather Channel Presents The Best of Smooth Jazz); and kings and queens of funk Rufus And chaka-chaka-Chaka Khan.If you paid attention to that last paragraph, yes Massive Attack sampled a chap who, apparently, used to be a sewer designer. Or rather, they covered one, in the form of William De Vaughan's brilliantly written Be Thankful For What You Got.As a closing thought, my sources remind me that Massive Attack were sued for sampling Manfred Mann's Tribute, forcing the Bristol dark-hoppers to change the name of the song on future pressings.  Considering the amount of sampling they got away with, the Massive boys* should count themselves lucky.I recommend Protected - Massive Samples, if only for the reason that it's a collection of tracks that was good enough to be pillaged by one of the greatest bands of all time.* If I get any dodgy google traffic now for 'massive boys', I'll be livid."},

We have been so fortunate to tour the world together, while at the same time having a massive amount of laughs at one another's expense.Aside from Charlie's singular genius and musical gifts, I can tell you that he was a total sweetheart of a guy, and a loving friend and confidant to people everywhere. His musicianship was surpassed only by his greater gift to the world - his warmth, his generosity, his unquenchable humor, and his undying loyalty to those whom he loved. In the spirit of honorable mention, however, I should mention that he had a shoe collection that was marvelous, knowledge of hip-hop that was profound, and knowledge of wine that was subtle.He is survived by a sister, a neice, a nephew, his mother, his stepfather, me, and more adoring friends than the Universe has dark matter.

'Camouflage' is the name of yet another album by Merzbow, out this month.  A special edition of this album is in the shape of a seabed and is limited to just 149 copies.Bird fact four.  Akita is from Tokyo, which is in a place called Japan.  The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds was founded in Didsbury, which is very much not seen as the 'Tokyo of Manchester'.Bird fact five.  You can listen to Merzbow's Woodpecker No 2 on Last FM.  It pretty much sounds like a lot of his other stuff.Bird fact six. Akita attended Tamagawa University, which has a Honeybee Science Research Center.  Honey bees are not birds.Bird fact seven.  While in Akita's home country of Japan, TV-presenter and planet-killer Jeremy Clarkson tricked the country's speed cameras by shielding his face with a mask of ornithologist Bill Oddie.Bird fact eight.  Merzbow is named after the work of Kurt Schwitters, who once made adverts for pen makers Pelikan.  (I wanted so much to type 'penguin makers' just then.)Bird fact nine.  The bird with the most feathers is the Tundra Swan.  Max Tundra is an electronic musician, as is Merzbow.Bird fact ten.  Masami Akita switched to using laptops some time in the 'noughties'. Chris Killen's debut novel The Bird Room was probably written on a laptop. Probably.Bird fact eleven.  Akita is into bondage.  There is a bird called the red knot.  There may be a connection there, I'm not sure.Bird fact twelve.  A cassette compilation called Massaconfvsa, featuring Merzbow's track Everywhere It's Machine (Grid Module 3), was released in 1988 on O Crow Records.  It seems to be the only thing O Crow has ever released.Bird fact thirteen.  If you're baffled by Japanese noise music, read Paul Hegarty's Noise Music: A History, which has a whole chapter on Merzbow.  Birds do not read books, as a general rule of thumb."},

This post was going to be a review, but I can't find anywhere to hear the blasted thing. So I googled 'dance floor psychedelia', but all I got were references to trance music.

I'll be in my bathroom.", "date": "Jan 9, 2009", "text": "The Future Sound Of London are a bunch of selfish bumholes.By my reckoning, they've had seven album releases in the last 12 months. Seven. I don't think I achieved seven of anything in the past year.I probably had more than seven poos, but that's about it.Here's the evidence. They started with the Pulse EPs, an album-length rerelease of old things they did under different names before Coolio was in the charts.Secondly, they continued the blowing-off-the-dust theme with From the Archives Vol. 4, which boasted more than a smattering of tracks from old LPs (ISDN, Dead Cities and Lifeforms).Environments, their long-awaited album in July, was a shuffling of old material that did a pretty good impression of the classic KLF album Chill Out.About the same time, Amorphous Androgynous released The Peppermint Tree And The Seeds Of Superconsciousness. What's that got to do with Future Sound Of London? They're the same band. The fifth album of the year was Yage's world-music offering The Woodlands Of Old, featuring an ex-Propellerhead on drums. Yage is FSOL's engineer. Except Yage isn't, because Yage is actually the guys from FSOL pretending to be their engineer. Confused yet?They followed this up with the fifth volume of From the Archives Vol.5, alongside a second volume of Environments. That's seven albums, people. They are the James Pattinson of the music world.I think they are being selfish. Hogging a whole year like that.They also released a recording of oscillators that reacted to the movement of clouds across the Sun. They are working on a musical remix of a film directed by an Oscar-winning animator. And their gig later this year, as I mentioned in my recent 2009 preview, opens up the possibility of them performing their first new live material for 12 years.Despite all this, I still think the only guaranteed pleasure in life is having a poo. Think on, FSOL.mpSunday: In the latest of a series where I give away free music (now not necessarily on a Sunday), get your teeth around this Wipeout 2097 classic.

My blog is now read by more people than it ever has been, so you are part of an ever-pulsating crowd clammering for a bit of Fat Roland. Well, you can have me. Every last bit of me. (I am now sprawling on my chaise longue, swooning like a fop.)Right then.  On to Kraftwerk.   Florian Schneider, the robotnik on the right in the piccie above, has exited the Kraftwerk autobahn by quitting the band.   According to my pocket calculator, he was in the band for 38 years.  To put that into perspective, teenager-snuggling metallics-botherer Bill Wyman was in the Rolling Stones for only 30 years.   Schneider co-founded the band that invented every other synth band ever.  He used to ram a flute through a ring modulator.  Sir David 'Christ The Saviour' Bowie named a song after him.  That was a metaphoric ram, by the way; Florian Schneider does not, and has never abused woodwind instruments.But still, he has quit.  Sigh.  I hope his musique doesn't stop, and although he'll never be big on the radio, activity for this model music maker should hopefully continue.  I also expect his solo projects will be far less desperate than my attempts to shoe-horn in as many references to Kraftwerk track titles as I can into this post (eight altogether - um, can you spot them?!).  Florian is a delight to watch on this interview from a decade ago.  He starts off reticent and bemused, and it just gets worse...Interviewer:  Are you preparing a new album?Florian:  Yep.  [smiles]Interviewer:  Do you like the new generation of techno music?Florian:  Ya.  [doesn't smile]"},

It is unlikely to be as frenetic as Dan Deacon's live performanced.  Deacon counts a mallet among his percussion instruments, and has been taking to the stage with a synth-heavy 14-piece ensemble at recent gigs.  For that reason alone, seek out his new long-player Bromst.Oh and former members of Plone and Broadcast have formed Seeland, who I reckon are a hot tip for 2009. When you clap ears on their debut album, you'll spot whispers of Stereolab and the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.The rest of 2009.One of Paul Simon's favourite bands, Grizzly Bear should give Warp Records a new album in May, or thereabouts.  Speaking of Mr Simon, I still haven't forgiven the garfunkled-one for Graceland.  And while we're at it, I'm still boycotting Sly Stallone films for the travesty that is his 1996 movie Daylight.If I kept my CDs on shelves, with my favourite artists on the higher shelves, and my least favourite artists on the lower shelves, Plaid would have their very own shelf about fourteen miles above my house.

As I said in this post back in November, they have promised it won't be \"an exercise in nostalgia\". Of course, we all know it will.Portishead ended 2009 without a record contract, so expect some In Rainbows-style tomfoolery with their fourth album. It should be out around September.On a more commercial tip, ex-Pop Idol contestant (spit!) and new darling of the press Little Boots will claim 2009 as her own. She's worth watching because she uses a Tenori-on, which is a pretty Japanese music making box that lights up. The same people who rave about 'Boots enthuse about La Roux.Finally, you may need to strap me down because I am insanely excited about one particular artist.  The Glaswegian Hudson Mohawke refers to everything as \"shite\" on his Myspace page.  He's not being negative: he's just being, well, Scottish.Mohawke is a new signing to Warp Records, and he flips between electronica, hip hop, electro and soul in ways that really shouldn't be possible.Someone somewhere labelled his music as \"emotronic\" (probably H-Mo himself).  He's working on an album which should sound a little like this:"},
{"title": "One of the worst days of my life", "date": "Jan 3, 2009", "text": "Before I unleash the second part of my 2009 preview, let me splash cold water over the proceedings and talk about the death of my pet.A moment of bittersweet comedy happened on the day my 19-year-old cat Whiskey died.Her death was peaceful and tender.  At the vet's, I held her eye-to-eye as she entered her final moments.  After she died, I left her at the surgery to go through the grim rigmorole of cremation.  I walked into the cold street, swinging the empty cat box at my side.  The box was a symbol of what I had lost.As I left the vetinary surgery, with my whole world collapsed, I got in one of the numerous private hire cabs that offer their services to burdened animal owners.  I eased into the back seat, and was bemused to see I had positioned the box with the front grill facing me.  Force of habit.  I was crying in little hiccups: I took a deep breath, and gasped out my street name.The driver had one of those weather-worn friendly faces, with big brown eyes.  He noticed the cat box and my teared face.  He seemed to put two and two together.  He fixed his gaze upon me through the mirror, staring right into my grief, deep into my own eyes.  It was a  moment of real connection, and in a thick accent, he said a few words: \"I'm sorry, mate.\"He was sorry for me.  Truly sorry for me!  He had reached out with a soft, empathetic understanding.  I responded with a sob.  I remember saying the only words I could think of in my sadness.  \"She... died.\"The friendly face in the the mirror blurred as more tears fell down my face.The taxi driver halted for a moment, then replied, \"No.  I'm sorry, mate.  I've taken another call.  You have to get out.\"I have never misread a situation so much in my life.  There had been no 'connection' at all.  He was just being practical - I hadn't noticed him taking another job on the radio as I got into the car.  And bless him, he looked so mortified once he realised how blackly comic the misunderstanding was.My tears gave way to giggles.  As I walked off, box in hand, I'm sure there was a little sprightliness in my step.  Thank you, taxi man, for unwittingly giving me the chortles on one of the worst days of my life."},

I have probably missed a number of major titles, and quite frankly 99% of sales in '09 will be X-Factor related, so it's all an exercise in futility.January.The remnants of Add N To X have teamed up with space rockers Fuxa for a looping joy of a single Add N To Fu(x)a. I hope it's a taste of more to come from this pair.Following his well-received album Just A Souvenir, Squarepusher will release an EP of \"dancefloor psychedelia\" called Numbers Lucent. If the Square one isn't nominated for the next Mercury Music Prize, I'll eat my slipmats.The shoe-collecting Telefon Tel Aviv will flop out their first full-length offering for five years. When Immolate Yourself hits, it could be one of the best discs of the year.February.The Eft will waft its way from Samandtheplants, while Susumu Yokota - whose hypnotic The Boy And The Tree album was used liberally on Sunday's Top Gear Vietnam special - will explore a more vocal sound for his new Mother LP.Not to be outdone by the Prodigy, Massive Attack will attempt a monumental return with the provisionally-titled Weather Underground. The double-album of \"gothic soul\" is pretty much shrouded in hushness, but it is rumoured by the rumour mill that Tom Waits will feature. That's even cooler than Hot Chip's single with Robert Wyatt a couple of months back.If the Prodigy and Massive Attack had an arm wrestle, who would win?

I'm tempted to plump for Javier Bardem's baiting of a gas station owner in No Country For Old Men, or the moment we realised Indy was on a nuclear test site in that vivid scene with the dining table dummies in Indiana Jones And The Crystal Skull.But it's neither of these, friendo. My favourite scene of the year taught me everything we need to know about the fragility of life. In Hellboy II: The Golden Army, our foul-mouthed protagonist fights an Elemental - kind of a vegetarian Godzilla - and the resulting death scene is astonishing, beautiful and the absolute opposite of the throwaway baddie deaths we often get with Hollywood.Crappest purchase of 2008.Gym membership. I should have seen the warning signs as soon as I walked in: \"Gym? What's a gym? ... Oh! A gym!\"Back to films again - which was the best in 2008?Strange beasties ruled 2008. Firstly, Wall-E was one of the best animations for years, and the most tender robot love affair since Bjork's All Is Full Of Love video. Cloverfield was a lost creature of a different kind, in a film which was simply a tour-de-force of suspense and large-scale horror.Another pair of strange beasties brought us the best two films of the year. Heath Ledger gave us 2008's best performance in The Dark Knight, although he should have rescued his magic-trick pencil and crossed through a couple of over-long scenes. Instead, I raise a glass to the Oscar-winning monster Anton Chigurh and No Country For Old Men - the bestest film of 2008 following a couple of worrying Coen Brothers misfires.Anti-Obama: the biggest political disappointment of 2008.Brian Eno has completed his first year as Liberal Democrat youth advisor. I was a tad disheartened to see the modern-fangled youth of today haven't all shaved their head and dedicated their lives to Robert Fripp or Mixmaster Morris. It's still more thug life than My Squelchy Life. Come on, Brian, get it together.My moment of puffed-chestness in 2008.I was proud that I tried a stand-up comedy routine, which was scary but gosh I did it. There was some comedy in there, it was rather routine, but at least I was standing up. My challenge now is to do more in 2009.My greatest personal achievement of the year was losing 50 lbs in a few short months. Yes, I know, I should mention these things on my blog so you can post messages of encouragement / bitter jealousy. The only thing I won't allow is \"Thin Roland\" jokes, because believe me it has been done to death by my wonderfully supportive if slightly unoriginal friends.Top telly of 2008. Yes, this is getting a little sad now.Watching The Wire on DVD doesn't count, because it came out in, like, 1526 or something. So then, two little words sum up my favouritest TV moment of this blessed 12 months.Dead.Set.My worst moment of 2008.There is only one. A couple of weeks ago, my cat Whiskey died after a brief illness. She had been my closest companion since I was 16, and I have felt aimless and listless since I lost her. I have 19 years of fond memories of a good-tempered, sleek, shy furball. She deserves a hundred blog posts, but what needs to be said can be said in just a few words: I'll miss her forever.2008's best album. Probably.A tough one this, as I don't think it has been a classic year for electronica. I think Metronomy and The Whip are a dish best served live. The Bug took one giant dubstep forward with London Zoo, while fellow dubstepper Burial wowed the Mercury Music Prize with his 2007 album Untrue. I seriously rated Bochum Welt's ROB (Robotic Operating Buddy) even though I didn't rave enough in this post from April .Portishead's Third showed Tricky a thing or two about keeping fresh after years out of the fridge, and Leila's equally accomplished comeback was quiet but beautiful. Gang Gang Dance's primal Saint Dymphna was Warp Record's most tribal release, while Squarepusher held back on the drums for his jaaazz Just A Souvenier album. (Edit: I forgot to mention Autechre's Quaristice, which I attempted to play as background music in my bookshop but only succeeded in pissing people off. Consider it mentioned.)And finally, top of the tree is a gathering of geeky keyboard wizardary called Hot Chip (pictured). Made In The Dark's mechano pop is a little to commercial for this snobbish blog, but oh what joy when it produces videos like this for One Pure Thought.Skip to the end...There. I called it. And it came up heads. I'm going to buy a bicycle before all the shops close down. Meanwhile, I'll cook up a little 2009 preview. While you're waiting for that, have a joyous new year."},

Although the album was meant to work for an arty-farty event on the other side of the channel (in a land called France), the sprawling, spooky compositions work in their own right.The only downside is the record's loaded with harpsichords and flutes, and is therefore giving me flashbacks to my third year music lessons at Parrs Wood High School.My favourite album this week is the seething bucket of steaming sub-bass that is Lord for £39, the latest offering from Edinburgh's Neil Landstrumm.The rolling tech-bass tickles the feet of ragga and plays footsie with bleepy console noises to produce what ought to be a sombre bad-boy wonky techno effort. Except, the album has titles like Ross Kemp As Pixel and Easter Krunk Power, so it's hard not to smile.Finally, keep your eyes open for a 12\" from Dorian Concept called The Fucking Formula. It snaffles Landstrumm's fuzzy bass and wonkiness, but it has a Prefuse 73 accessibility about it.

It's a massive, brightly coloured bag of broken Roland 303s, 606s, 808s and any other shiny palindromic music box you care to mention.If you rate Luke Vibert and Squarepusher (who dazzled at last week's Warehouse Project, but that's for another post), or if you pine for old Aphex Twin, you should have this album in your collection. Just be prepared for sporadic ruptions of cheesy pop and TV adverts.More straight down the line is Harmonic 313's Dirtbox single, which is a darker bad-boy slice of his usual gasping slow-motion Detroit technoWhen his album hits in a couple of months, it will sit proudly alongside his classic album of nearly 15 years ago, the ambient beast that is 76:14.Ah, yes, 15 years ago.

A nail-bomb thrown into a skip, which in turn is being humped by R2D2.2. An iron bin full of iron filings being rolled down a hill made of iron.3.

Back in Ted Heath's day, there was a collosal jam session to end all collosal jam sessions.King Crimson lynchpin Robert Fripp was meant to be laying down some phat guitar licks for the god-voiced Robert Wyatt, when he bunked off to lark around with Brian Eno.You remember Brian. I did a Bri Chart of him once.Anyhoo, the resulting session between Fripp and Eno was the historic 21-minute opus Heavenly Music Corporation. This rich, mesmerising wash is a highlight of their No Pussyfooting album, which has also, like the 808 State albums, been released back into the wild.Which means it's a good week for old LPs.

If Burial (pictured) doesn't win, I'm going to smash in my telly. I scan the room for a suitable heavy object. I look at my sleeping cat. She's quite big. Not fat, but tall. I consider what it would be like smashing in a TV screen with a cat. I drink my juice.9.58pm: The programme starts shortly. Massive junglist Goldie has just lost some orchestra conducting contest to either Mel or Sue out of Mel And Sue. Clive Anderson is presenting this programme. I wonder if he will stay on my telly and present the Mercury Music Prize.10.01pm: Ooh, it's starting. The titles are all blue and neon like it's Casualty or something. Lauren Laverne, ex-90s indie star, is presenting. She interviewed Squarepusher once and she looked like she didn't know who he is. I hope she rates Burial. She's just called the nominees a \"mish mash\".10.04pm: The Last Shadow Puppets are performing; they're how I would like the Coral to sound. Some indie band has just played, and now there's a woman hammering her fist on a piano. Oh look, now it's British Sea Power, who are glorious.10.08pm: During a bit of punditry which makes it sound like a football programme (\"Simon Armitage: \"He can do no wrong for me.\"), I wonder what 'mish-mash' music would sound like and how I would dance to it.10.10pm: After some r'n'b nonsense, Burial's Ghost Hardware lights up my TV like a solar flare, but a really dark solar flare. Oh please God let him win. Gosh, is that Robert Plant? Hasn't he got wavy hair?10.12pm: Lauren Laverne: \"It's not just a young man's game any more, is it?\" It's not flapping FOOTBALL, for gizmo's sake. Props to Armitage who desperately wants the mysterious Burial to turn out to be a \"retired military historian from Kent.\"10.14pm. This is moving on apace. Oh tindersticks, it's Adele. GETHEROFFTHESCREEN! Aaaargh, my ears hurt, Make her stop! Oh, she has. And now it's Radiohead, who are God and I will punch anyone who critizised them. With my cat.10.18pm: Armitage has just called Radiohead \"our generation's Pink Floyd\". Come on, Imran Ahmed, say something interesting. Yes, he's just tipped Burial for the win. He's a wise man.10.20pm: That jazzy guy with a lady's name with slicked hair (Jules something) is bigging up the audience with a bit of sub-Stephen Fry wordsmithery. I suddenly want Elbow to win. Or Portico Quartet, just to wobble the applecart. Maybe I'm just mentioning these bands so I don't look so foolish when Burial doesn't win.10.22pm: And the £20,000 goes to... come on, get on with it Jules... I'm sticking with Burial for the win. It's... Bury's own Elbow. Brilliant. I always knew they'd do it. Didn't I tip them? Didn't I? No?10.28pm: My poorly cat sleeps on, her paw snuggled over her eyes, while Elbow do a refreshingly good-natured interview with Laverne. She's got some kind of virus that keeps attacking her every few months, poor thing. My cat, I mean, not Lauren Laverne. I decide not to use her to smash in my tellybox.

It is a review of some recently released records. The records are not well known, because I'd rather punch the panda of pop into next week's zoo and crack open a sparkling giraffe of dubstep instead.Clear? Good.Nightmares On Wax is back. thought so... is his annoyingly titled new album which plays havok with those of us who like our ellipses at the end of sentences and our capitals at the start.There, the havok stops, because this is the earhole equivalent of soft furnishings, of magnolia, of a shop assistant's smile, of baked beans without the chilli powder, of food in a university refectory.In short, it is not an Affleck's Palace: it is an Arndale Centre. A tastier take on chill-out comes from Araya, whose debut LP Bridge Of Hesitation is grounded with tinkling synths and guitars, not unlike Lemon Jelly's more comatose moments, before being kicked up the arse with a more wiry version of the Boards Of Canada production ethic.I can only review the mp3 version, which is a glitchy, meaty platter that pleases from the opening Plaid-ish chimes of The Mast to the panicked cut-up vocals of the stomping closer Child, Let's Stop.The CD edition has more tracks, and even has a cut called Murakami's Kangaroo Zoo. For haruki's sake, what next - Ishiguro's Badger Super-Collider?Finally, it's time to mirror, signal and (Roots) Manuva. I'm not sure what that means: but I do know that the best British rapper of the past decade has a new album called Slime And Reason.

The latest, Eight Oh Eight (pictured), has just come out so I thought I'd write up a little review, bury it, and have it dug up in two decades by a trenchcoated man with cruddy fingernails. Eight Oh Eight is a touch disappointing. Opening track With Honey Cream sounds like Jimmy Somerville in a tube. But then it all begins to sound like Jimmy Somerville in a tube, with pure high energy disco funnelled through an increasingly wacky range of effects like flanged beats and robotic vocals.I'm a sucker for the Air-esque cheesiness that Black Devil have plumped for, but I can see how the cheese could grate. The bongos and whistles on at least a couple of the tracks (Open The Night and Never No Dollars) are my least favourite sounds since the noise of cluster bombs missing army officer James Blunt.Black Devil Disco Club's Eight Oh Eight is closer to 'oh' than 'eight', but only just.

I've just realised (a month later) this was my 200th blog post. Hurrah! Light a candle or summink!Ten years ago I flipped my first disc onto a spindle in public. I was rocking big beat in a rough bar. I broke the decks. I bombed.But Fat Roland (yes, that's me pictured) was born unto the world, and the rest - as they allegedly say - is hysterical.My head is seeping with memories as I think back through my decade of DJing. Little snapshots.Electrical tape, perfectly parallel, pretending to be Tron lines on a floor. Long, smooth, edgy drum 'n' bass mixes and my DJ mates nodding in appreciation. Deciding to dump the beatmixing for John Peel-style weird track choices. My mate Fil signing the letter T when I play something he liked.Sweating in a hooded top as I played the 'cool DJ' role with a bunch of energetic South Africans at Manchester Apollo. My wedding DJing phase, oh my wedding DJing phase. Lifting someone's ample bosom, two handed, from the needle-knocking danger zone. Lending my decks to LTJ Bukem's former musical partner and learning to mix jungle just by watching.Some record label guys thrusting a pure white, unlabelled 12\" at me - and my joy when I realised it wasn't crap. The sunshine last August and the couple dancing near the front. Beat-mixing at a skate park five gruelling hours a day over ten days, which included putting on a long DJ Shadow track while I had a poo. Being chased from Rusholme with said chum Fil, covered in wallpaper paste and flyposters.I have slowed down, like an 80-year-old driver. Work is my steering wheel, and I just can't get enough cushions of spare time to rise me high enough to drive (by drive I mean DJ) safely (by safely I mean often). I'm tempted to delete that last sentence, but no, I'll just keep typing. Be damned.I now find myself working three doors away from my first ever gig, and Facebook has put me back in touch with some of my pals from that time.It all comes full circle. Like a record.

The Black Dog, in fact, with an album of sparkling ambient techno called Radio Scarecrow.Amid a cacophony of remixes and rereleases (Book Of Dogma artwork remixed above), I reckon this is their first new material for a while. It lopes over that brow with certain intent: to be nostalgic, to be minimal, to be ever-so-slightly Detroit.Word on the grapevine says the basslines are so intense, the band had to take scheduled breaks from recording.Health and safety, you know.The Black Dog dates way back, before music had invented all the notes, and so does Meat Beat Manifesto.MBM is headed by arthritic vegan Jack Dangers, and they have thrown another LP of breakbeat-rolling distorto-dub in the shape of Autoimmune.Dangers is meant to be a magpie when it comes to gathering samples, but it sounds like he's avoided nest nicking for a while considering how old some of these samples sound (\"say whaaat\" and the like).Instead, why not befrend Bochum Welt's ROB (Robotic Operating Buddy)? This album is out now on the legendary Rephlex imprint.Third track Saint (Dmix) is a spit for a New Order track, but don't let its synth-pop tendencies put you off.ROB is an acidic Atariesque throwback to early Aphex and catchy analogue (kraft)work-outs.I leave you with an mpSunday, where I slowly give away my music collection.

The Smiths weren't already million-selling music moguls with more clout than the Cloverfield monster's boxing glove.And the Smiths were a guitar band, with guitars and everything. I think Gallagher's original winge was about Glastonbury's guitar heritage and the inappropriateness of a (gosh) non rock 'n' roller in a high profile spot.Noel is, of course, talking out of his eyebrows. Baroness Lady Dame Shirley Bassey sang her blinged-up boots off last year, while Carl Cox and Basement Jaxx are among bucketloads of dance acts who have rocked Glasto.Who could forget Orbital redefining dance music forever in 1994?Surely Noel hasn't fallen for the drip-drip tabloid headlines about rap music being a hive on the nose of humanity? You know the headlines I mean. Just between the stories that say the internet is full of evil and the screamy ads offering you a free pony.Jay Z isn't the reason why Glasto ticket sales are down. He fills venues, he doesn't clear them. And the Grey Album was one of the best Beatles / hip hop mash-ups of 2004.Blame it on the weather. Or the economy. Or a lack of great new bands.

The harmonies come from vocals torn up by wolves and fed through a lawnmower. The fragments that remain are alluring but ever-so-slightly unsettling. Harmonic 313 is a side project from Mark Pritchard, better known as one half of Global Communication. His EP1 is a triumphal throwback to the early days of techno, when it was all about Detroit. So yes, it sounds all a bit Juan Atkins without the smoothness, but it works for me.A whole manbag packed full of Thom Yorke remixes have been released in the last couple of months. Meddling with the lazy-eyed Oxford boy's music are Burial (unfairly labelled as a 2step Massive Attack), Four Tet, Christian Vogel and Newport Pagnell's DJ Surgeon.The utterly ironic thing about electronica remixes of Radiohead's frontman is that, whatever you do, you just end up making it sound more like Radiohead. Which is a good thing, and you should sniff them down in record shops now.Finally, Clark is breathing fire again on his new offering, Turning Dragon. He has put all niceties to one side, has walked into the Women's Institute (electronica sub-committee) meeting, and machine-gunned everyone to death with bad-tempered percussion and ADD-level techno.Listening to his album is like trying to nail gun exploding fireworks inside the Crystal Maze dome.

Above is a bar chart interpretation of Jay Z's 99 Problems, and you can see plenty more here. If anyone can tell me the collective noun for charts, tell me using a graph.Because blogging is the way I speak, I've kept silent about lots of music. Not least Sun Electric's Lost & Found (1998 - 2000). The tracks were rediscovered on an old CD-R, as the title suggests, and it's a welcome reminder of a band that have been dormant for donkey's.Sun Electric always lacked the crunch of their techno peers Orbital, and perhaps the production talent of some-time Orb dabbler Thomas Fehlmann lent their music too much whimsy.When it's not trying to be Brian Eno's Nerve Net on a little too much horse tranquilizer, Lost & Found works wonderfully, not least in the flapping rhythm of Echelon which sounds as though the whole thing was recorded inside a pipe.A hop over to the Leaf Label now, and Murcof have thrown a curve-ball with their new album Cosmos.Their glitchy precision has been buried in favour of ambience sweeping from Mahler-inspired moodiness to Wagner-inspired pomposity. (All the other reviews have mentioned György Ligeti, but I don't know who he is and I'm bloody useless at classical comparisons).It's either quiet, or it's the ambient equivalent of a guitar solo. It's certainly not worth buying it on its own, which is good because apparently it'll be fully realised as an audio-visual project.In fact, stuff all this lot. Screw it. If you're looking for something on which to spend your hardcore pimp wage, plump for Luke Vibert's Chicago, Detroit, Redruth. Playful acid rave has never been so listenable, and it's the first album I've owned dedicated to a Cornish town.mpSunday: Pole's Stefan Betke remastered the newly found gems on Sun Electric's Lost & Found.

With a dark but open street ahead, I hurry on to safety with his threats ringing off the brickwork behind me.Store Street has never been my favourite road in Manchester. I have to make it safe somehow.If only I'd had The Tattooed Bouncer with me. He was a vicious looking gentleman with ink all over his head, and he impressed me once at a Plaid gig by dragging a casual drug toker out of the Music Box by his throat. When I say 'impressed', I mean 'terrified'.But sadly he has died, a claim the deceased bouncer has since owned up to according to local news reports. Fat use for next time I waddle down Store Street.Here's another idea for making Store Street safe. When there's thrills and pills in abundance, you don't get threats of violence, so maybe someone would be kind enough to convert the street into a clubber's paradise.Maybe, just maybe, we could bribe some of the great names to spin some plastic mp3s: Armand Van Helden, Layo & Bushwacka!, Dave Clarke, High Contrast, Jeff Mills, Aphex Twin.I'm free this weekend, so it could run from then until, say, New Year's Eve.

He has stepped from behind the knobs to produce Ekvílibríum, his debut album on his own Bedroom Community label.His LP starts with feet on safe glitchy chill-out land, but he eventually hoists himself up onto Brian Eno's garter and catapults high into heavenly string-laden non-anthems, especially on the spacious Equilibrium Is Restored.Sigurdsson can't tell eerie from airy, so some of this album lacks the intended atmosphere, but it works if you like Bjork and Sigur Ros' more ethereal moods.And while we're on an Icelandic tip, I'll get round to reviewing múm's Go Go Smear the Poison Ivy when I can be bothered to get out of my curry-stained threadbare armchair. I bet they can't beat Finally We Are No-One.High on a cloud somewhere, just above Eno's flying garter, is a surprisingly chilled out Mu-Ziq and his new record Duntisbourne Abbots Soulmate Devastation Technique.He has locked away his gabba-gabba-hardcore-wherez-me-light-stick breakcore of previous offerings in favour of a sound that made me as sick as my cat (see past post) within three tracks.The album's suffocated in detuned Boards-style melodies, which creates a see-saw effect right where your dinner's settling. Each track induces a sense of nostalgia, but only it sounded just like the last one.Bring back the gurning mentalism, please Mr Ziq, because you're making us, er, siq.It seems a little late to be reviewing Simian Mobile Disco's Attack Decay Sustain Release, but I need to up the tempo somehow. And it damn well should get the blood pumping thanks to more than a slight nod towards the jacking acid of Daft Punk and the energetic nerdiness of !!!.I shudder at the thought of being A. N.

It's what cats do.Except she connived to sit on a chair and projectile vomit at a height before switching direction twice to complete a scattered ring of her her brown, festering insides.And so with my bedroom covered in stinking heave while the rest of the universe was sleeping, I retreated to Youtube to find a remedy for my predicament.Skimming neatly past the 'how to clean vomit from carpets' tutorials, I bumped into Cylob's mid-90s single Cut The Midrange Drop The Bass. This was a playful splatter-rap of rave lingo over cheery melodic electronica, and playing it at full volume at three in the morning somehow rendered my hoik-encrusted walls immaterial.Just on the strength of the video, though, take a look at Cylob's Rewind (above). The unofficial sister single to Cut The Midrange, it features martial artist Chloe Bruce who bizarrely shares a name with a former Hollyoaks character. Apparently.For the full Fat Roland experience while watching this video, please imagine the smell of rotting, regurgitated meat, some of which is still dripping from your computer screen.If you are duly enchanted, then set your mouth to 'O' for 'wow' because I have exciting news*: Cylob's human alter-ego, former trombone player Chris Jeffs has set up his own label Cylob Industries. In other words, one of electronica's creative clever men has a license to print records.That means three Cylob albums in three months. Yes, wow! Trojan Fader Style is already out, Bounds Green came out on Monday, and next month sees the release of Formant Potaton. Find how to grab a copy of any of them here at Cylob's blog.I slept easy after getting all excited about Cylob on Youtube.

Like this.\"For a scruffy haired loser who shuffled around in a painful green suit and wine red tie, a dancefloor was very much like a barbeque is to a penguin; it was a new thing to me and the heat was causing chafing.It's the Herbal Tea Party in mid-90s Manchester and I'm being taught to dance by an enthusiastic stranger. I must have looked as stiff as a door if I needed a punter to dive in and rescue me from complete humiliation.The Tea Party stands now as a monster club night in darkest Hulme that has never enjoyed the continuing exaltation of its bigger counterpart, Manchester's Megadog. It's a shame, especially for HTP's very own Dr Frankensteins, co-creators Ian and Rob Fletcher.Thanks to them, electronic music bowled me clean over, especially when:(a) I bought Orbital's brown album purely based on an amusing review in the NME;(b) as a hack, first interviewing one of the Fletchers (I forget which one) but being drawn by a One Dove record playing in the background. I'd never heard proper, creative dance music before, barring the KLF, The Orb and assorted chart rave bands.There isn't much about the Tea Party on the internet near me. A few forum mentions, but then this gem of a photograph (above).It's a ticket, posted by Armcurl.

I was frightened by the owner of Birmingham's Beyond club once because he offered me a beer. And I once bumbled into MC Tunes, who threatened my very life just by casting me what he thought was a casual glance.And I never got into tea either, despite the best efforts of Mr Scruff to make it the tipple of choice for Manchester clubbers.But I did learn to dance a bit, and the Herbal Tea Party turned a scruffy haired loser into a shaven-haired loser with a penchant for Higher Intelligence Agency, Drum Club and Sabres Of Paradise.

Before you worry, I do give an arse, sometimes at half price.)The treacle saxophone thing can't count as fact number one because I may have made it up. I do know, however, that they are the fourth biggest band ever to come from Dumfries and their Golden Skans single is something to do with x-ray machines and urine.Okay, no, wait, I can do this.Fact number one: Steve Lamacq is a former member of the Klaxons but was politely asked to quit because of his boy band looks.Fact number two: The genre 'new rave' was originally coined by Bob Monkhouse to describe the up-and-coming comedy act Hale and Pace.I've checked Wikipedia, and neither of those facts are on there. So let's just rewind:Fact one. Something about the Waterloo line and dogging in tube trains. They have light sticks but 87% of the band are colour blind. Fact one. Their next single is Lady In Red in a non ironic way. That rumour about Connor Nichols, James Righton and a blow-up doll of Leo Sayer.  The Klaxons were going to call themselves The KLF; they stopped spelling at the third letter. Fact one. Two of the band members' middle names is Susan.I can't do this. This is a post about the bloody Mercury Music Prize. Fact one: The Klaxons won it. Facts two to ten: The Klaxons deserved it.

Half-Life is all breathless synths and sinister crackles, while Last Day Of Winter is watery and hesitant.A Field marches like an army with pinheads for shoes. The delicate Piano Dust is heart-breaking and intimate, and that's the key; the album is so well produced, every padding bassdrum and swooshing chord pours straight into your eardrums.Afterglow will reward you with what it says on the tin. Go buy.At the other end of the spectrum, maybe on a secondary spectrum complete with its own biohazard label, is the tumultuous mayhem of Shitmat's new offering Grooverider.Don't be hoodwinked by the reference to the drum and bass legend; this is old skool Britney-sampling jungle cut and pasted into fresh genres that didn't even exist five minutes ago.It's inevitably formulaic: cranked-up breaks stabbed with broken vocals and sporadically laid to waste by doom-mongering sirens or pant-wobbling sub-bass.But it's fun tee-hee, just like his earlier track Agricultural Ardcore, which was the god-awful Archer's theme tune hacked to a stump.If Shitmat is Red Bull laced with amphetamines, Bola's latest album Kroungrine is peppermint tea laced with nothing. Not so much a downer as, well, a bit boring.It lies somewhere between DJ Shadow and lounge jazz, but it is certainly neither. They should nick a trick or two from the Vector Lovers."},

This year it featured Billy Bragg and Coldcut, and in the dark, distant past has accommodated Lamb, U2, Bill Drummond and, er, Midnight Oil.My task was to present programmes on Greenbelt FM, the on-site radio station, and help run the main Sunday morning communion service.Me and the radio got on like a house on fire, without the screaming victims. I did five hours of showing off, otherwise known as presenting, plus various reporting bits and several hours of editing. I also teamed up with Lee to host games in a live radio show with a real audience, the highlight of which was Lee mopping up like a loon after a spectacularly messy game while grasping the mic because we were still live on air.My Glitchbelt gig was cancelled as a favour to that venue's programmer Ben. I was busy enough anyway, although I felt sorry for friends who said they were looking forward to it.But the good Lard taketh away and the good Lard giveth back in spades...Greenbelt's main communion service has a congregation of somewhere up to 15,000. As the festival grew, they set up an 'overflow' Arena stage with big screens so you could partake in the main event albeit from a distance.My job was to 'remix' the service for the Arena with the hugely talented Spir (pictured) from Fuse Factory. We messed around the dry feed with extra audio and visual elements. For example, during the collection, the main stage sang something hippy, while our stage rocked out (correction: nodded out) as I played a Gescom track while VJ Spir produced some trippy visuals.The ambient backing we gave to the rather traditional communion service seemed to be appreciated by most people on the Arena stage.The best bit came when the guys running the stage asked us to do an impromptu half-hour gig at the end. So Glitchbelt hit the buffers before it started, but instead I DJed with Fuse Factory to a crowd of somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000.Am I complaining? You can't complain when you're on cloud nine.Thanks must go to Sanctus 1 for letting me do the service in the first place, and to the Arena personnel for putting the cherry on top with the gig. Respect to Spir too; it was a pleasure working with you. Oh and big up to the Greenbelt FM massive for making the weekend so much fun.Here's my first mpSunday freebie for ages.

I'd better press 'publish' before midnight..."},
{"title": "RIP Tony Wilson aka \"Mr Manchester\" 33AD to 2007AD inclusive", "date": "Aug 11, 2007", "text": "BBC News website: \"Anthony Wilson, the music mogul behind some of Manchester's most successful bands, has died of cancer. The Salford-born entrepreneur, who founded Factory records, the label behind New Order and the Happy Mondays, was diagnosed last year. He died on Friday evening at the Christie Hospital surrounded by family.\"I only managed a third of Anthony H Wilson's egobiography 24 Hour Party People before I flung it across the room. That'll learn that self-obsessed narcissist, I thought. You can only go so far when someone constantly refers to themself in the third person, as though they were some separate entity, like a god or an ancient spirit.Fat Roland was not impressed.But Wilson has a right to be arrogant. Today, the netosphere will be full of talk of his greatest achievements, including working with Richard and Judy, starring in the hilarious Cock And Bull Story and, of course, living with a former beauty queen.Apparently, he also set up a club and a record label or something. I might have to google that one.My iconic image of Wilson will be his early television career, hacking for Granada Reports then fronting the punktastic So It Goes.My radio co-presenter (and now producer) Lee insists the role of a \"mike jockey\" is simply to be a talking box for the producers' genius ideas. He's right, of course. But Wilson held his own (oo-er) and you knew he was never an autocue slave.I'm not sure of my Manchester credentials. I am a Mancunian, but I live in the posh bit. I was into Madchester, but at that time was just as likely to rave on to Candy Flip. I never loved the Hacienda; I only really hooked onto the place in its dying days.That said, Wilson's passion created the Manchester I know, with its minimalist record covers, ill-fitting clothes and awkwardly placed pillars in clubs.Rest in peace, Anthony H Wilson, Manchester's modern-day Jesus H Christ.

We have slain Maine Road, consigned Factory to history, hacked the Hacienda to pieces. The Warehouse Project at the doomed Boddingtons brewery was as much of a goodbye as a hello (although the Project is back soon).And now the live music extravaganza that rose from the IRA explosion of 1996 has at last imploded. The drum has ceased beating for DPercussion. The band has put its instruments down. The dancing is but a shuffling memory. The metaphor has stretched far beyond the field of flogged horses.So good job then I got round to discovering The Whip. They remind me of Underworld, Lo Fidelity Allstars and, yes, even Apollo 440. Fresh from their appearance at Manchester International Festival, they rocked the roof off DPercussion, which is damn impressive in an open air arena.Above, there's a video of The Whip performing Trash, my highlight of the DPercussion set, although this particular show is in somewhere called \"Bris-Tol\".And below is a fellow raver at the DPercussion Whip gig caught on the Fat Roland mobile phone. I suspect some wag swapped his Nytol for battery acid.It ain't what you've got, it's how you shake it."},

It's a shame then that Walls, the album it's from, is liable to send you back to the Land Of Nod faster than you can say \"quick let's fill this blog with antiquated literature references\".Walls is a hugely listenable album. My ears have even sent me a thank-you card. But it works as backing music for movies, not as a huge artistic statement.TV and radio producers take note; you need Apparat in your collection. And if you use it in a programme as a result of reading this, make me look really smug and leave a comment."},

My music taste by nature means I can get lost in a repetitive mantra which, essentially, doesn't change for six hours. My middle road is so narrow, I have to build bridges over the cats eyes instead of going round them.And I confess to liking some r 'n' b, no more so when I saw The Ladyboys Of Bangkok do Usher's Yeah routine at the Lowry a couple of years ago.It does seem strange that the very week Rihanna claims this decade's record of the longest run at number one whilst simultaneously releasing her own range of umbrellas in the wettest period of UK history, the queen of r 'n' b she is hoping to depose Beyonce Knowles \"falls down some stairs\" in Orlando, Florida.Actually, the umbrella move is shrewd. You see, her single is called Umbrella. And she has released a range of umbrellas. Her single is called Umbrella. Umbrella. And she has released a range of umbrellas. Umbrella. Umbrellas. Subtle, isn't it?This could be the start of a new and startling range of cross-promotional opportunities. All sorts of records could be used to shift product. It's the kind of business acumen Tesco would kill for. No, seriously, they actually kill people. With hammers. This sounds like bad stand-up, but they do really kill people with hammers.I have trawled the backlist of Warp Records, and sifted out some electronica albums that are desperately needing some merchandising spin-offs.

{"title": "Reqing out* to retina.IT gets the headnod over stalking Sven Väth and Andrew Weatherall in The Orbit", "date": "Jul 25, 2007", "text": "So what musics have been troubling me ears?Let's begin with Cylob (pictured), who made his name in the 90s remixing the likes of Aphex Twin and Mike Flowers Pops, both of whom sport more hair than they deserve to. The 'lob span his first reel-to-reels in The Orbit club, Leeds, a venue which arguably spawned my Fat Roland career. I remember watching DJs Andrew Weatherall and Sven Väth with intense interest, hovering behind them like a stalker. As I left the club, I had a lucid moment when I decided, with a theatrical flourish, that yes the world needed my DJing skills. (It didn't, but I went into DJing anyway.)Cylob's new track Rock The Trojan Fader isn't as immediate as his lovable classic Cut The Midrange Drop The Bass, but it has the same playfulness and eccentricity. Vocoded voices dance up and down analogue keyboards while everything else collapses into a heap of flurried beats.It bodes well for new album Trojan Fader Style, which I haven't bothered to listen to yet because it's all one long track.On to everyone's favourite aging relative, Unkle.The moment Unkle persuaded arch-miserablist Thom Yorke to wail about rabbits and headlights, I was transfixed like a rabbit in some headlights. Yeah, neat simile, I know. Since that high point last decade, we haven't had much output from the band founded by James Lavelle and David Holmes-collaborator Tim Goldsworthy. So the new Unkle album War Stories should be a rare elixir.It isn't. It is a decent rock album, and comparisons to Kasabian and Stone Roses are fair. The opening tune Chemistry reminds me of Puff Diddly's ridiculously entertaining Come With Me: that's not necessarily a good thing.But the Fat Roland blog is about electronica, and when Unkle are collaborating with the likes of Josh Homme and The Cult's Ian Astbury, it just ain't gonna ring my bell.Like former member DJ Shadow, they seem to have found a formula that works. Generally. Most of the time. Kind of. They just need to move on from trip-hop rock crossovers, which were vogue about 52 years ago.Back to the good music. When I played retina.IT's infectious Tetsub at Manchester's TV21 bar recentlly, I was overwhelmed with a head-noddy Req moment. Anyone who's got into Req will understand me.retina.IT have now released Semeion, a greatest hits of sorts, full of mid-tempo glitchy bleeps and distorted yet distant funk.Their studio lies within erupting distance of Mount Vesuvius, and I wonder if they haven't got a satellite or two picking up the sinister clicks and scrapes sprinkled across this sparse, lunar album.It's such a pleasing effort, lying somewhere between the coldness of Robin Rimbaud and the chunkiness of Clark, that I'm going to give this the head nod over Cylob and Unkle.I'm careful about who I hyperlink to on this site. Thankfully, I got through this post without mentioning that Unkle used to record in Meatloaf's recording studio. Ah dammit, there's a link to Meatloaf. Oy, stop linking to Meatloaf. Aaw look, Blogger's gone and put a label down there too...*yes, Reqing out.  I just invented it."},

It's more a case of feeling utterly pessimistic about the future of the record shop.The closure of Fopp has been covered extensively elsewhere on the internets, so in short it went something like this:Step One. It doesn't matter how much you take through your tills; if your cash flow dries up, you're done for. A private company buys MVC from Woolworths. It cost them their cash flow. They went under.Step Two. It doesn't matter how much you take through your tills; if your cash flow dries up, you're done for. Music Zone buys MVC. It cost them their cash flow. They went under.Step Three. It doesn't matter how much you take through your tills; if your cash flow dries up, you're done for. Fopp buys Music Zone. It cost them their cash flow. They went under.There's a business lesson there somewhere. Maybe you can spot it. Write your answer on a postcard and send it to HMV before they fall into the trap.I liked Fopp. The one in Manchester had a cafe. It didn't feel cheap like Music Zone. And if my grey cells are firing on all one cylinders, the fallen Fopp stands pretty much on the burial ground of the old Piccadilly Records. I'm going back a few years here, to the days when punks used to growl at passers-by between the shop and the old sunken toilets, in which lay interesting brown treasure.Anyhoo, let's just blame Prince and move on, shall we?Breaking news... the Mercury Music Prize nominations have just been announced. Last year I was horrifically wrong in my predition, so for now I'm just going to list the nominations and then think about it a bit more:>The Arctic Monkeys' Favourite Worst Nightmare>Basquiat Strings featuring Seb Rochford's Basquiat Strings>Bat for Lashes' Fur & Gold>Dizzee Rascal's Maths & English>Jamie T's Panic Prevention>Klaxons' Myths of the Near Future>Maps' We Can Create>New Young Pony Club's Fantastic Playroom>Fionn Regan's The End of History>The View's Hats Off to the Buskers>Amy Winehouse's Back to Black>The Young Knives' Voices of Animals and MenAugust update: Fopp has reopened because HMV bought it.

It seems just to be work, work, work right now, which is silly because my staff are lovely, it isn't exactly rocket science, and cool things happen most days.

On the positive side, I am playing a one hour DJ set in Cheltenham in August, I will be presenting several shows on Greenbelt FM, and as a third string to my crossbow, I have spent some time recently writing funny things in a wild and wacky notion that I would quite like to try out a bit of stand-up comedy.That last idea is based on the notion that (a) I am essentially an egotist and a show-off; (b) I get a huge kick out of making people laugh; (c) my imagination tends to run riot and I have spent the last year capturing it all in notebooks; (d) sometimes when I see a stand-up comic, I think I can do better, which brings us full circle to (a).Anyhoo.

Those whose letter corresponded to the most-written-in square were put into a prize draw.The most played letter was B (specifically Big Wells, Bjork, Boyz Noize, Battles, Bird And The Bee, Boards Of Canada and Boom Bip).

We have DJs play non-guitar-based music and we festoon a dizzying array of themed projections and games around the place, while punters drink beer and laugh about the internet.The theme this time was ABC / 123. Here is the story of that night through the magic of mobile phone pictures, pictures, pictures... (Blogger: an ability to look up and tilt the blog into a cloudy dream would be useful for moments like this.) We arrived at our venue, Manchester's glorious TV21, in the pouring rain. The raindrops were quite literally the size of planets. We were offered the use of an umbrella by caring bar staff, but of course we scoffed, being hard and that.TV21 is a very well equipped venue. It's nice to be able to have equipment that doesn't fall apart upon being breathed at, and to have a room which allows for awkward wire routings and ceiling-hangings.The first challenge is finding places to project onto. The basement of TV21 is bright and jazzy with swirling lights and Dr Who monsters hidden in unmentionable places. It is also quite cluttered, so we set about covering a wall with a sheet. This would have the equivalent effect of sticking a single Elastoplast onto one of Hannibal Lecter's victims, but you've got to give it a try.Above, you see Fil nimbly putting up said sheet. You can tell he camps.  We then wired a laptop to three large, round buttons. Pressing a button chooses a video. The videos were a magificant mix of Sesame Street and geeky Youtube vids about things beginning with the letter T (tights, tablets, toaster). We projected this onto the Elastopl-- er, the sheet. Here you see Stephen creating art, like God playing around with ideas in Genesis (\"now, where should I put this sausage thing?\"). The multicoloured letter box was then rigged with a camera and projected onto the other side of the room, so people could create 'art' in real time.You will see some of those 'artistic creations' in another blog post in the next few days. Stephen was our enterpreneur for the evening. He flogged bead necklaces for 50 pence a throw. The bead set cost us £10 and we made £10 back. It might not impress Alan Sugar, but I'd hire him.  And finally, we bedecked the tables with various letter-based games. And yes, the game pictured above (Letter Link, £7-ish, Woolworths) is exactly like Connect 4 but you have to spell words rather than match colours. Richard Whitely will be frolicking in his grave. When I say \"we\", I really mean Stephen and Fil because they did all the hard work while I barked orders and acted like a primadonna disc jockey. So how did it go? The second half of the story will appear on an internet near you in the next few days."},

My parents booked me lessons in piano and music theory, and, do you know what, I was a bit of a whizz.But then rave happened. Pianos were 'establishment' and synths were 'underground', so I dropped the classical in favour of amazing Junos that could make helicopter sounds.Which brings me to the reason for this post.Faerie’s Aire And Death Waltz isn't a real waltz. It is the most wonderfully ridiculous musical score. I've included it in this post (above), but you can see a bigger version here.I knew enough about scores to know that andante wasn't a way of cooking pasta. But I'm sure these notations weren't in my lessons, including instructions to \"moon walk\", \"untie slip knot\", \"release the penguins\" and for the harpists to \"stand up and wait\".It's frigging genius, which is something I would say if I was the type of person to use pretend swear words.See more fun and imaginative surrealist scores at Thrilling Wonder.

The LCD Soundsystem-style bedding is not as experimental as other Mars material; it is immediate and urgent and fits so well with Smith's distorted ramblings.All counted, The Fall have released over 90 albums. Von Sudenfed's album stands as a highlight in that swaggering legacy. If you like The Fall, buy it.Less successful is Telefon Tel Aviv's Remixes Compiled.This is a tottering pile of production work stretching back to the days when they were in short underpants.

In other words, he has been capturing noises with the magic of microphones rather than ripping from other records.The result is a collection of sporadic sheep bleats and cutlery clinks that goes on for two hours.I am, of course, lying. It's the usual blunted cinematic denseness from Tobin, keeping your head in the reefer clouds and your feet in rock and roll hell.

This unique instrument has been used to much greater effect by a million people from Led Zeppelin to Marilyn Manson. And there was a band I saw at the Roadhouse once but I can't remember their name, so let's move on, shall we?No, comedy theremin is okay by me. Bill Bailey does comedy theremin well - and a damn sight better than this other video by Fintushel.

Now, he answers to Tatamax, and he's just blurted out a superb album of cut-up sounds and dream noises.It's called Wells Sentry and it's his debut album as Tatamax. Some will label it 'musique concrete'. This is where lost souls frolick through the long grass with a mini-disc recorder, a microphone and several large Francophile pretenses.It is indeed a disc full of detailed found-sounds; there's a great snooker ball clack which bounces around the inexplicably-christened 54434D iadem.But with the exception of the Venetian Snares-lite Kill Switches Demo, this is a haunted house of wafting dynamics and cheap plastic sonics that will keep you entertained long after the ambience has tip-toed back to spook your nightmares.While you're in HMV confusing them with your request for this particular piece of digital tomfoolery, why not ask for Emissions: From The Archive?This is a compilation of early Two Lone Swordsmen tracks. When I say early, I mean it's way before they started sounding like PiL. The 'Emissions' bit refers to the label they ran before they were scooped up by Warp Records.It could be very standard upbeat mid-90s lounge dance, if it wasn't infused with late-night-smoky-clubness. Expect your clothes to smell in the morning.And remember - this is from the same production brain that brought you Sabres Of Paradise extra-orgasmically-gorgeous Smokebelch.Finally, I would type about Matthew Herbert's new offering Score, which is a big pile of music he's written for films, musicals, ballets, jazz clubs and scouting jamborees. I lied about the last two.But I don't like it much. Instead let me spend the last few lines of this internetular missive telling you I am writing this from an internet cafe in Southport (time used 46min, balance £2) inbetwixt running a bookshop for a chorus of Salvation Army people.I bet Aphex Twin's never done such a thing.

It's a progressive, aggressive pop song with sharp, nasty, bitey teeth, graar graar.So Bjork is back - and how.

Considering she hadn't even dipped her toe in radio before, Caz took to the airwaves like, well, radio.(Bad simile, sorry. I should have mentioned something that swims to follow on from the 'dipped her toe' image, but then I would have likened Caz to a graceful sealion, and one thing Caz is not is a sealion.)I really enjoyed working with Caz. It was only brought down a notch when someone complained because I had the nerve to suggest that Cosimo Cavallaro's My Sweet Lord was (a) a clever statement on the commercialisation and trivialisation of Christianity and (b) a subtle metaphor for consuming the body of Christ through the sacrament.It seems that if you don't side with the bigotted Christian 'majority', then there's something wrong with you.If you're the one who complained, then please deal with this: homosexuality is fine in the eyes of God; Christians don't have an exclusive claim to heaven; a lot of the Bible simply isn't true, it's just poetic metaphor and storytelling.There, that should get the phones ringing. If you want to argue with me, I'm happy to talk about David and Jonathan, Mahatma Ghandi and the Creation story respectively.You can tell I'm annoyed, can't you?Actually, I'm not annoyed now, but these are some of the thoughts that were spinning round my head earlier on today. Then I realised that \"evangelical-baiting\" isn't very Christian and is better left to the likes of Religious Freaks.After more plan, plan, plan, I reeled off another presenting slot, from which I have just returnified.

Maybe it was because it was less obvious; its awkward habit of breaking away from a 4:4 structure made it as dancefloor friendly as a rabid bouncer. I liked that.So it is with frothing delight that I hear their Parallel album, released two years after 'Balls, is being unleashed today in the black, brooding shape of the Book Of Dogma. Along with the classic Parallel, the new release also includes old EPs Virtual, Age of Slack and Techno Playtime.Some of The Black Dog went on to gain fame as Plaid, and for that reason alone, this is an important release. The fact that they practically invented IDM / techno in the first place makes it more than important. It's essential. It's electrifying. It's greased lightning. You'd better shape up because I need a man. What? Um......I was lost in a haze of hair gel and leather for a second there. Anyhoo, The Book Of Dogma is old fashioned techno at its dull, dour best.

The trail of destruction is terrible, but I am determined to see this blog series out.And so for my third and final entry on the Theatre Of Noise podcast, let me introduce you to some of the things we did on air through the power of photograph.Your starter for ten. Dan The Weatherman reported on the inclement weather from the confines of a brick:We played a game called Sin Lose Or Draw. Contestants would try and draw a sin (as defined by a fairly right wing Christian website) and their team partner would try and guess what they were scribbling. While people were shouting their guesses, for extra \"colour\" I would read a list of insults traded between opposing theologians.This may not sound like an ideal game for radio, like charades on internet forums, but believe me it works like a dream and it will be returning to Refresh FM the week after next.Anyhoo, here is one of the team's sheets:The sins pictured here are (clockwise from top left): thievery, witchcraft and being a conjoined twin. I'm not sure if I've remembered the third one correctly, but the important thing to bear in your filthy little mind is this is the only sheet I could put on this blog. The other sheet had a hand-drawn represention of the sin of fornication, and I will only show it if you really, really, really beg me by leaving a reply on this post.We also played Chainsaw Challenge, in which a bunch of dim-witted morons vote on which CD is worst and then we destroy it with a power tool. In this case, it was an angle grinder, and the result was:In case you're bothered, it was a Chris Bowater CD.And so that was the podcast that was. Don't believe me?

This is the season for the mammoth-mowing cricket olympics [1920s haddock version]; a true Englishman's sport.No time for that, however. I have been pottering in the studio with the rest of a collective collectively known under the collective name of Theatre Of Noise. As you know, I promised to keep a picture diary of our podcast, so this second installment follows a first installment, which makes a good deal more sense than mammoth-mowing cricket olympics [1920s haddock version].>Pointy shoesSo to the first picture we go, with gladdened hearts and pointy shoes. Behold a sixth member of our crew, George. He was our Gmmaz engineer for the day, and is well into his drum 'n' bass, although I've lost his Myspace URL so he doesn't get a nice orange link.While we're talking technical, here's a photograph of eight subchannels with red faders. They are red because each one of them (a) increases sound levels and (b) launches a nuclear weapon six miles south of Oswestry, which is fine by me because Oswestry is a frozen shithole much in the style of Winnipeg.>Making horseshoesYou have to know your Venetian Snares albums to get that last sentence. Anyhoo, we were given one big microphone and we had to make a horseshoe around it. After the metalwork had finished, we gathered ourselves into an extended semi-circle. (Keep up now...) It felt just like recording the Archers. I hate the Archers. If you listen to it, stop; it's rubbish.Here's that microphone, set against a background of soundproof glass, our two-page running order, and an Important Red Marker Pen. Look at the microphone. Isn't it a nice microphone? The round thing is a pop shield, which automatically converts any music into an insipid synthesis of a Britney hit.With pop on our mind, it seemed only appropriate to interrupt our podcast - our \"popcast\", if you will - to indulge in a smidgeon of karaoke, as led by Fil.>Three legsFil took the pictures on this picture diary, although obviously not that one, unless his left arm has a third elbow to enable him to hold a camera from that angle. That's my shoulder on the left. I have just landed upright from a Swedish three legged karaoke flip, which incidentally has only ever been performed successfully by me, the Chuckle Brothers and two former members of Primal Scream, although not at the same time.I hoped this picture diary of our podcast would be informative and revealing. It's not working out well, is it? Part three, the startling denouement*, coming up soon.*copyright Nikki French 2007"},
{"title": "Theatre Of Pictures: Volume One", "date": "Feb 21, 2007", "text": "And so the Theatre Of Noise crew stumble into a studio to record a podcast, as explained in this previous post. This is the first of a series of three picture diaries of that podcast, featuring pictures taken by Fil*, otherwise known to millions as the number (4) in the next paragraph.We are (1) me, (2) Lee, (3) Dan The Weatherman, (4) Fil The Destroyer and (5) Stef The Hip Hop Bruce Lee. It looks like I have just made up these nicknames. You may be right.>ArmedWe arrive at the studio armed with literally tens of ideas. It's written on a schedule which is then pinned to a board and left teetering on a chair so we can all see it.Before we air, you could cut the tension with a pair of Superdrug nail scissors. How would we use the time? Would we produce a successful programme without all the bitching and in-fighting that usually takes place? Already, Dan The Weather Man (pictured left) and my co-host Lee aren't talking:>SlappedJust before the above picture was taken, Lee slapped Dan The Weather Man across the face. You can see Dan The Weather Man is still reeling, his thoughts of cumulonimbus and nimbostratus clouded over by feelings of hurt and anger. Clouded over. Do you see what I did there? That's why I'm a writer.There was only one cataclysmic disaster: we forgot to get the balloons for our Balloons And Darts game.>StanceStefan The Hip Hop Bruce Lee is a black belt in b-boy stancing, and can drop the mic like a very unruly person indeed. His infectious giggling was one of the highlights of the podcast for me. Here he is taking a photo of a caterpillar hiding inside a matchbox.He will keep this photo on his phone for several days until he is attacked by a wall, when he breaks his knee and mashes his ribs. That bit is true, about the breaking and mashing, not about the photo, the caterpillar or the matchbox. Get well soon, Stef.>HugJust before we go on air, we take part in a corporate man-hug. This is similar to the kind of side hug you get in churches from people that would rather flagelate themselves than be physically close to you. In this case, we formed a large circle and leaned in at the waist, ensuring the most basic of hug while safely keeping our genitalia at maximum possible distance:Pictured mid-hug clockwise from top left is Lee, some wires, Fil The Destroyer and Dan The Weather Man. More about Fil The Destroyer in the next of this riveting picture diary series. >LiedOkay, I lied about the man-hug too. Much of this post has been spurious, and I apologise. All you need to know about the podcast is some boys had control of a room with mics in and we could swear if we wanted to.Looks like Stef The Hip Hop Bruce Lee is better already. Here he is doing squats as recommended by non-doctor Gillian McKeith:Gah! Another lie.>ThrilledIn the next Fat Roland picture diary extravaganza, expect to see George our studio man with your very own eyes, and be thrilled at the amazing technology that surrounded us; it was like living in the future, only the cars had wheels and the Dutch weren't ruling the world.*I probably should have asked Fil's permission to use these pics..."},

Unlike most other radio shows dedicated to Christian music, the Theatre Of Noise is all about destruction, loud guitars and (I hope) annoying Christians who deserve to be annoyed.>Foot spaWe're having to prepare, of course. Lee is walking round with cucumbers on his eyes, and every day I drown myself head first in a foot spa. Perhaps a more constructive element of our preparation was our time in a real life Gmmaz recording studio to 'lay down' a podcast. I'm yet to load it onto i-Tunes, but in the meantime the podcast is available as an mp3 download on our Myspace page.While you're listening to that (it's shambolic, slightly rude and full of nonsense; this was quite deliberate), let me bestow upon you my plans for this here blog. >StupidityOver the next two weeks, I will blog a picture diary of our time in the studio. I will introduce you to the characters that took part in the podcast, show you the technical side of our stupidity, and give you a fascinating visual insight into the games and props that make the Theatre Of Noise what it is.

I thought I had it in the place I had left it, but instead I had put it in a safe place, which was the last time I had it but I didn't think to look in the place that was the last time I had my blog.>Get on with itI was thinking about Psapp (pictured) and how their playful sound reminds of how I used to love 'found sound' - people who made music from field recordings or things in their kitchen. I didn't realise, but Psapp (pronounced 'sap') are an example of toytronica, where they make electronic music from children's toys and toy instruments. And then I remembered that chap at a previous Futuresonic festival who made distorted white noise from a rewired Playstation.I want to do this. >Wooden carBut I know how it would go. My friend Dan The Weather Man once gave me a build-it-yourself wooden car, where you stuck wheels onto a wooden frame, added some wires and stuff, then created the electrical loop to make the battery work and the wheels go round. It still sits in its original box, mostly built but lacking the right wiring to power the machine. I don't know about making things work, especially when it comes to electrical things.So I'd buy my Build-Your-Own-Toytronica-Instrument from Ikea and lay all the parts before me. Nuts, bolts, a drill, a saw, two screwdrivers, then all the constituent parts that will eventually make up the instrument: a plastic trumpet, a music box, a Sega Dreamstation, an Operation board game, a Barbie doll, a chicken called Brunhilda (actually used by Psapp in real life) and, naturally, some mechano.>African dialectMy main obstacle is the instructions. They're often written in cod English, translated from an obscure African dialect only know by six people and a parrot. I have little time for bad English, so I'd need to hire a translator. Actually pay out of my own pocket for a translator, who would then read out the instructions in clear, gramatically perfect Queens' Best.Of course, hiring a translator would be ridiculous. No, not just ridiculous: totally ridiculous. No. I'd build one. I'd have a separate area of the living room floor with all the nuts, bolts, drills and chickens I needed to build me a translating robot. But then I'd need the instructions to build--- oh dear. You see how I'm no good at making things? >Mecha-lazerAnd then there are the electrical shocks. If I try anything clever with electricity, such as building a mecha-lazer beam to split the sun into two, I always get a shock. Static shocks are the worst. The most annoying thing about dying of electrical shocks is it takes ages to get the balloons off the corpse afterwards. At least they provide adequate padding in the coffin should your beloved remaining on this earth hire a particular clumsy-handed firm of undertakers.I've also just learnt that Psapp throw cats at their audience. I've also got a growing suspicion Psapp are the ones who invented the phrase 'toytronica' in the first place, so I'm not even writing about a real genre.Ah well, at least I found my blog, and that's more than I can say about my dignity / pants / brain / virginity [delete according to taste in humour]."},

If a song sells well that isn't available on CD, the stores will fill the blank spaces in their top 40 display with notices saying you can buy the song online.Imagine an entire high street music shop consisting only of signs saying \"you can't buy this here\" and \"go home and download this instead\".

Rather than drown you with a flood of recommendations from 2006, here is a simple six-fold selection to ensure salivation through sonic satisfaction.For the first time, I have included 30-second sample mp3s for you to listen to. Just click on the link and your Quicktime player will summon up the fairies that make music happen on your screen. The mp3s will only be up for two weeks, mind.(Artists that I considered but didn't include in my top six: Isan, Battles, Dabrye, Susumu Yokota, Monolake, Hot Chip, 000, Boxcutter, Wagon Christ, Biosphere and Quinoline Yellow.)Artist: SquarepusherTitle: Hello Everything (album)Label: Warp[site] [mp3 no longer available]Those who prefer Squarepusher's harder drill 'n' bass fare should stay away. Otherwise, this is a playful pot pourri of some of 'Pusher's biggest weapons: junglism, ambience, jazz, stupid synths and frenetic bass guitar mayhem. And it's ever so melodic, which means this is a good album for those tentative souls yet to foray into the strange world of Tom Jenkinson.Artist: Luke AbbottTitle: b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b (track)Label: Output[site] [mp3 no longer available]Now come on, this is just silly. The reviews call this an \"8bit adventure\", which basically means there is zip all quality to this repetitive bit of nonsense. This was also one of the few moments of absolute genius in 2006. Luke manipulates the circuits of electronic toys and produces the kind of results only found between the matrix and the real world. B,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,brilliant.Artist: Nathan FakeTitle:Drowning In A Sea Of Love (album)Label: Border Community[site] [mp3 no longer available]As you would expect with a \"sea of love\", listening to this album is like being hugged by a hundred marshmallows while having your feet massaged by clouds. Electronica / IDM has not been this warm and inviting since The Orb's last party in hell. Jump in, take your socks off, and absorb yourself in what I hope will be considered an masterpiece by the time I'm selling drugs to my grandchildren.Artist: FM3Title: Buddha Machine (album?)Label: FM3[site]FM3 are a Chinese experimental music duo who decided to spurn the usual format of CD or mp3 or whatever, and instead released their new album in its own dedicated piece of hardware. The Buddha Machine is a small plastic box with a speaker that emits nine short drones that you toggle between using a switch on the side. And that's it. And it's one of the best things I have ever bought.Artist: ClarkTitle: Boddy Riddle (album)Label: Warp[site] [mp3 no longer available]Clark, who used to be known as Chris Clark but had his Chris stolen by hoodies, is an electronic artist, but his music encompasses post-rock, musique concrete and the dishwasher to boot. I don't know whether to file this under disco, ambient, krautrock or space music. Alls I do knows is this is Clark's most complete album to date and it will happily stick out of your CD racks like a native American on a psychiatric ward.Artist: Boards Of CanadaTitle: Dayvan Cowboy (track)Label: Warp[site]Forgive me for including a third Warp artist in my top six, but I can't ignore the monster that is BoC. Dayvan Cowboy spilled forth from their Trans Canada Highway EP and, well, see it for yourself... with THE MAGIC OF VIDEO. With this ends my blogging year. See you on the odd side."},

Lily Allen was both 'street' and pedestrian, while Chantelle and Pete Doherty were either OMG like sooo cool or complete morons, depending on your take.We were forced to think about Chris Tarrant and Mark Oaten's sex lives (not together, although they would make a delightful couple). Michael Richards and Mel Gibson destroyed our faith in Seinfeld and Braveheart respectively.Tony Blair and David Cameron annoy me so much, I want to gnaw the back of my knees off. Paris Hilton, Catherine Tate and The Feeling are also boils on the bottom of life I want to lance with the needle of justice.In fact, the only public figure that didn't want to make me grate my eyeballs and syringe them back up my nose was Mr Lordi (pictured), whose band stormed to a well-deserved Eurovision success with this glorious number.>Knob of 2006I think butter just about edges the victory here, over the bed and door variety.> Film of 2006Bond took a menacing turn for the better, but I still can't take those films seriously. I missed any films to do this year's overriding theme of animals and planes, so I lost out on United 93, Snakes On A Plane and any one of the million films about penguins. The Departed, Superman Returns and Children Of Men were pleasant surprises, and A Cock And Bull Story made me giggle lemonade out of my nose, if only for Stephen Fry's impressive \"cock!\"My favourite film of the year came right at the beginning, as the turkey and stuffing was still swilling round my insides. From the opening bomb explosion, Munich was unsettling and brutish and shied away from moralising, and thankfully avoided the usual saccherine Spielberg fare.>Near death experience of 2006Sankeys Soap in the summer. Yeesh. At least, it felt like near death. I'll tell you over a beer some time.>Post of 2006Yes, from my own blog. I really am that vain.Autechre sell tinny frog-puke enducing cancer machines always seems to come up on Google searches and provoked an anonymous commenter to call my post \"a load of sniffle\", although the whole post was cheapened by my use of a Dilbert cartoon. My Misadventures In Sound series chronicled my DJing on Refresh FM last Easter, although I never quite finished it. Filter: Beckett & Taylor, Luke Abbott & 000 provoked a respectful mention on a record company website. A little less respectful was It's 3.30am and this is what I think of Da Vinci, which was written in a fury after wasting good sleep over an appalling film. Five things I don't want you to know about me was similarly heartfelt.I have to plump for the Fatbelt series as my favourite, in particular Fatbelt: notch 3 which saw a whole nation take Saffron the goat to its heart. Well, about three people anyway. My favourite phrase of the year was from that post: \"Friday waltzes in to the room like it owns the place.\" I like that, I must use that again.Is that smug enough for you?>Smug git of 2006Yes, okay, I'll go away now."},

She is a glitch artist who dillies with found sound, and dallies with orchestral experimentation. >FlowersHer new album will be called Eyes Set Against The Sun, and it features samples taken from her garden. Audio samples, that is; she isn't flower pressing, even though that is very womanly*.Australia's In The Mix magazine describes her as the David Attenborough of electronic music, and a particular quote from their interview with her (read it here) gives me hope that electronica artists' obsession with audio trivialities is not just a male fascination. >Amazing creakHere's what she says: “There’s a tree near where I live that has this amazing creak all of its own, and every little twig you hear sounds different if you bash it or step on it or rub against it, and because they are different types of wood they all make different types of sounds...\"I made a [musical] piece out of snow melting but it ends up sounding like water running because it obviously turns into water when it melts. Because it was all melting at different speeds and times, though, it sounds bizarre – maybe, to people, it could sound like I just turned the shower on! I enjoyed it, but in the end I got too cold and had to leave my recorder outside and keep popping back. I have no idea why I find it fun, but I do.” >FixationsHer childlike fixations sum up my thought processes about most things most of the time, although I'm not sure if that makes me a man's man, a woman's woman or just a Roland's Roland.*irony in action"},

Or I could listen to the Rollercoaster Project, which is a strange little single by a strange little Yorkshireman with angry synths on one side and furious axe-weilding on the other. It's oddities like this that keep me interested in music - a small pleasure, like sex on the top of bus shelters.Artist: SquarepusherTitle: Venus no 17 (single)Label: Warp[site] [listen]My mouth has oft raved about Squarepusher's Welcome To Europe album, with its willy nilly bass spanking mayhem. Yet, spin the globe back Superman-stylee to the ancient year of 2004, and here is the 'pusherman at his more straightforward, ADHD best.

I would stroll round music shops and make impulse purchases with hard real money cash. One of my better decisions was the beautiful Roland JP-8000, from which I got my DJ name. At one point, I went sledging and realised afterwards I had £1,300 in cash in my back pocket. I peeled the notes carefully onto a radiator, and once they were dry, I spent every last pound on something-or-other.>SingingI am a founding member of the Manchester Boy's Choir. I remember having a strict choir master who would make us learn a whole bunch of songs and then tell us just before a performance which ones we were going to sing. I sang with the Halle orchestra, and once walked into a pillar at the Free Trade Hall because I was nervous. I also learnt the piano and trumpet and I was a 100% wizz in theory exams.>RelatingI have almost no sense of family. My mother died when I was revising for my A-Levels, and my father died ten years ago. I had old parents, so many grandparents, aunts and uncles had shuffled off this mortal coil long before I had a chance to know them. This practical non-existence of my extended family may partly explain why I don't value 'family' as much as other people. I am not close to my two brothers, although I like them both, and I hardly know my seven neices and nephews. And if that wasn't enough, I have a half-sister I have never met (so make that ten nieces and nephews). This sounds very sad, but I fill the gap with wonderful friends, of which I have always had many. >WearingMy two worst fashion disasters are (a) my green suit and wine red tie I used to wear when working as a pop columnist on the South Manchester Reporter in the early 1990s and (b) my dangerously tight orange trousers, complete with orange jacket, I wore when I was going through my conceptual orange-and-blue-only phase. Everyone had a conceptual orange-and-blue-only phase, didn't they? They didn't? Oh... >MendingI am going to counselling in the new year. By some people's standards, I've been through some tough times, and despite having depression for as long as I can remember, I have retained my optimism and humour. However, I don't think laughing my way through things is working any more. I am very nervous about counselling, but I do believe a broken brain has as much right to be mended as a broken arm, and believe me, some arms are more broken than others.And now the tags: Blonde Janet, Daniel, Geekmonster, Lee, Sarahcontrary.Edit: Welcome onboard, Patroclus.

Killing trees upsets Dogmatix and I hate dogs, so that's okay.3. When do you put up the tree? I don't, I get my male au pair to put it up for me.4. When do you take the tree down? I'm strongly in favour of keeping Christmas decorations up all year round.5. Do you like eggnog? Nog. Er, I mean, no. I don't know what it is, but Starbucks sell it, and I don't like most things in Starbucks, so I probably won't like it.6. Do you have a nativity scene? No, but I do sell them for a living. I'd recommend the Brush Art Nativity set made entirely out of toilet brushes, or something. (Google it.)7. Mail or email Christmas cards? Neither, complete waste of time. Have a party instead and invite everyone you know, where ever they are.8. Favorite Christmas Movie? It's A Wonderful Life every time.9. Favorite thing to eat at Christmas? Turkey and all the trimmings, sometimes Belgium, but mostly Turkey.10. Clear lights or colored on the tree? I spit upon your American spelling, but \"colored\" it is.11. Favorite Christmas song? I'll Be Home For Christmas by Starflyer 59 or if I'm feeling really cheesy, then Stay by East 17.12. Travel at Christmas or stay home? Home. Travelling is for, um, travellers.13. Angel on the tree top or a star? A beautiful angel with a pink dress, glittery wings and a curly moustache.14. Open the presents Christmas Eve or morning? The problem with opening them the previous evening is I'm usually pissed on Christmas Eve, so I'd open my presents then wake up the following morning not remembering a thing. I would find all my opened presents, blame it on burglars, and I'd phone the police. I'd spend the whole of Chrimbo Day with the rozzers looking for anyone matching a photofit of a drunk Fat Roland, and essentially that means I would end up having Johnny Vegas arrested and the whole world would hate me forever for robbing the world of comedy.

The Warehouse Project is a great name for the venue on two counts: (1) it's in a warehouse and (2) it is a project, so it won't last forever.Unusually for us, we got there too early. This is okay because as middle-class toffs, we would have been mortified if we had arrived too late for the watercress sandwiches and the green tree and stilton soup.>Arms & legsAfter wasting time thinking about how we were going to last 'til six in the morning, we each cut off an arm and a leg for a three-quarter pint of beer. It was cheaper to buy a meal than drink a beer.Half way through the night, we bumped into two guys who were here for the house music night next door. We invited them into our techno ghetto, but they said something along the lines of they would rather cheese-grate their eyeballs whilst being fed their own liquidised fingers. Or they said they'd rather hear music to dance to. One or the other, not sure which.Apparently, Maggot from the Goldie Lookin Chain was there. This is a random fact and had no bearing upon our evening.>RitaI'd better talk about the music. The soundsystem is notoriously quiet, but I expected as much, so I wasn't disappointed. Unlike a few months ago when I went to Alton Towers to find Rita was shut. I mean, really.I hadn't heard Graham Massey's Massonix before, but I was more than au fait with his 808 State beat combo. It was much of the same: rich, complex, beautiful, a man clearly enjoying throwing everything into the mix and smoothing it over with analogue fuzziness.>LazersLFO were suitably over-serious, with monotone visuals reacting to every metronomic bleep. But the highlight for me was Autechre. Accompanied by a great lazer show (wooo!), their usual fare of disjointed percussion and clattery clicks sounded absolutely fabulous darling. You could hear every whir and every spap. (\"Spap\" is the only way I can describe Autechre's sound sometimes.)I didn't gurn, nor did I wave a light stick, but it was nice to hear some top quality electronica / IDM at a gig for a change.

If you don't believe me, turn the bass button to \"really bassy\" on your ghetto blaster and stick track four on. Ageispolis is likely to turn your trousers brown - not from your poo, but from all the angels' poo in heaven. It's that loud. Seriously.Secondly, We Are The Music Makers contains a sample from the original Willy Wonka film with Gene Wilder. Nuff sed.>WindowlickerI also love the album's simplicity, an attribute lacking in later tracks like Windowlicker. Technically, this is a third reason, and therefore the first paragraph of this post is looking a little shakey. Never mind, I shall continue.The album was a mammothian influence in my life. I would have killed puppies to have made music that great. I mean, how easy would it be? Just play one note, put it on a loop, then plonk a keyboard riff over the top, wazz in a few chords and give the whole shambles a name by tossing a box of Scrabble into a Kenwood BL440.>Pickled OnionIf only Pickled Onion* had been around then. He produced an online Phase Box, which might as well be called a Make Your Own Aphex Twin Tune box. I would recommend you play with it vigorously by following this link*.

The Toriton Plus comprises a bowl of water, a bunch of lazers and a dose of magic. Oh, and someone's hand.My mate Ed told me once he was going to buy some lazers to make a lazer harp. He would fire the lazers across the heads of an audience and people could reach up and cut the beams with their hands, setting off MIDI samples and thereby creating their own unique orchestra.All this triggers two thoughts. Firstly, I would be impressed at anyone who can make a lazer upright piano. And secondly, I wonder what the Toriton Plus would sound like if you replaced the water for milk, and you surrounded the whole thing with kittens."},

He said this was a great way to kill off any nasty viruses in your body.>MannaI decided to take his advice. I staggered to Manna Mexico, one of many fast food vans at Greenbelt that excel in both scrumptiousness of food and, like all the food vans, heftiness of prices. Grabbing the counter with both hands - partly for drama and partly for support as my legs were beginning to give way - I made my demand.Me: I want a burrito with loads and loads of jalapeno peppers.Manna man: How many? Five? Six?Me [makes cowboy-tough-guy face]: How many have you got?Manna man [making the burrito]: You'll kill the taste, you know.Me: I don't care. I'm ill and I want you to make me well with just one meal. Just ONE MEAL! [Flourishes camply]Manna man: Ah, a challenge! [Makes a pile of peppers not entirely unlike the mashed potato mountain in Close Encounters]I ate the hottest burrito this side of The Titty Twister, if 'tasted' is the right word. Belching fire, I retired to my tent. That night, clothed in everything I could find, I sweated through pores I never knew existed, and by morning I stank like a rotting buffalo that had drowned in a vat of sewage after a night out with a skunk and John McCririck.And I felt great. Like I was never ill!>TriviaMy final lunchtime show - and my last job for Greenbelt FM - was almost a serene affair. There was one hiccup - a bunch of Daniel Bedingfield fans, who had won in a pop trivia quiz, turned up to collect a prize I had never promised them. Lee actually bought them a CD, but their mum looked at the one CD, then looked at her three girls, and said: \"Oh. We'll just have to copy it\". Ungrateful cow.I am immensely grateful to the Greenbelt FM crew for the chance to mess around on radio for a long weekend. And I will be forever indebted to the BBC crew that supported us on the pretense of it being something to do with the Beeb's regional religious commitment, but really it was everything to do with giving a committed bunch of radio hacks the boost of a lifetime.>BeerI had time off in the afternoon. Bill Drummond talked about The 17, and I caught some decent music. I got my trainers muddy, and poked a sleeping pig with a stick (\"zzzzz grrrrrrnt zzzzzz...\"). I enjoyed the beer tent for the first time. And as I left the site at Cheltenham, a thought edged its way into the corner of my mind...\"Hmm, what if I was to do a series of blog posts about my experience at Greenbelt? I wonder if it would be interesting enough?\"...and now we know, don't we?"},

If you burn both ends, you not only get covered in wax, but you find yourself wading in a horribly overused metaphor.The saga continues (finally). After DJing at a Sanctus 1 event at Cheltenham's Greenbelt Festival, I scuttle back to my tent in the early hours of Sunday morning. After a smidgeon of sleep, I am woken up by a phone call.\"We need you in the studio by 9am. At the latest.\">GroggyIt takes a few moments for me to remember I am in a tent and I'm working with the BBC on Greenbelt FM, the festival's on-site radio station. You can see previous posts on this here. I carry my groggy body to the studio and within moments I am miked up ready to co-present a broadcast of the festival's two-hour communion service.It was a bit like commentating on the Queen Mother's funeral. I've never actually done that, so I could be guessing. There was the sense of fevered anticipation, bolstered by my lucid descriptions of people gathering in a field doing exciting things like sitting down and looking at grass and thinking.When the event was underway, it was all hushed tones and snipped descriptions (\"And that was Reverend Randy Bottoms and his flashing cassock. And now, the prayers...\").>SombreIt was immense fun. You had to know when to speak, and you had to watch the tone of your voice, depending on how sombre the mood of the communion service was. And yes, 'sombre' is the right word; it is the best word to describe most church services I have sat through.I have always been waiting to put on a serious 'radio voice'. At times I was just seconds away from lapsing into Mitchell and Webb's languorous snooker commentators.>FraughtThe afternoon was fraught with activity, what with having lunch in the rain and interviewing peacenik pensioner and former Iraqi hostage Norman Kember. Well, 'fraught' wasn't quite the word. But I did get stressed when I was bellowed at by a colleague for no reason at all. And with stress, long hours, tiredness and tight deadlines comes only one thing.Illness.By early evening, I looked like death. I worried a few people. I felt like crap. My throat was a war zone, and I passed from dizziness to muzziness with all the finesse of Alton Towers' Pirate Ship ride. I could hardly walk without feeling like that scene in Trainspotting where the ground swallows up that druggie bloke. My dulcet timbre and positively dashing vocal chords were evicted without notice. A tight, wheezy cough had moved in, shacked up with his squatter mates Captain Phlegm and Major Aching Shivery-Bones.>CollapseI don't know exactly when my immune system collapsed that night. But I nearly cried when I realised that I was heading towards my last day on Greenbelt FM. My final chance to impress the BBC and follow this crazy dream of being the next Brand / Moyles / Radcliffe / Peel (delete as inappropriate) could be a complete wash out.It was a few hours before bed and I could only see myself getting worse.This is the cliffhanger bit, when you post comments like \"oooh, how exciting\" and \"do tell me more\" and \"hey Fats here's my photo hows about a date do you mind if my grandfather comes along\".

The thrill of hearing that album for the first time was like meeting a new friend you felt you had known all your life. Like when Richard met Judy. Or when Punch met Judy. The other Judy, not that one.In the past eight years, I have grown fatter, stoopider but more optimistic. No such progression for BoC. They have a few guitars on recent album The Campfire Headphase, but they're still living the same lolling retro-daydream.>Kriss KrossSo respect due to a chap called Kaini who has set up a Boards Of Canada wiki site. 'Wiki' is the sound DJs make when they scratch records and is thought to originate from 'wiggida wiggida wack' from Kris Kross' 1992 hit single Jump. This is a lie.A wiki site is a website anyone can edit (not a lie), and you should check out the BoC wiki site now. It needs content, so get writing, people. Or you could just copy stuff from their Wikipedia page. I would write stuff myself, but I have no fingers.>David KoreshAnd while I'm bigging up the Boards, What The Hell Is Up With Boards Of Canada is a wonderful summary of their Geogaddi album, including all the David Koresh references, back-masking tomfoolery and, um, Pascal's Triangle of Binomial Coefficients.BoC are the best thing to come out of Scotland since Shooglenifty (not so much as a lie, as a post-post-modern ironic reference).

It seems appropriate to follow that with a fourth notch.It's Saturday, our first full day of broadcast. Greenbelt FM is in full swing, with presenters, producers, editors, reporters, techies and groupies working ten to the dozen to keep the thing on the air. Lee (of Penguins' fame) has been working since 4am, when he staggered out of the organic beer tent smelling of stale beer and pie juice. That is a lie, but it's a fair assumption that he worked as hard as he drank that weekend. >BitchI roll in at 11am, an hour before my first presenting slot, to discover that Lee is live-producing my lunchtime show. This is good because I am his radio bitch. We have good intuitive sense of how the other works, although nothing prepared us for complete flabble that lay ahead.The two hour lunch show is designed to have a live feel, so there's a lot of spontonaeity, stacks of special guests, and only one chance for me to impress the BBC with my interviewing skills.We glance at the running order, I get a thirty second training session on how to use the desk, and we're off. We have live links to a roaming reporter around the site, who at one point seems to be interviewing a barman from Eastenders. Guests are scratching on the door desperate for their moment on radio, and Lee is frantically organising them into orderly queues as well as writing cues and prompts for me so I don't dry up on air.>FireThe guests take their place in the interviewee chairs, one after the other like speed-job-interviewing. A woman with fire in her eyes tells me how Israel sucks. A bunch of Daniel Bedingfield fans answer inane questions about their hero, although it amounts to me filling in airspace while they um and ah and blush. A man gets killed in Africa (not part of the show) and I speak to his widow about her quest for justice.Bands litter the studio with flyers and CDs, gasping for fifteen minutes of non-fame. Some I interview, others are turned away. I remain calm, keeping my voice level and professional; I am the calm air hostess to co-ordinated Lee's pilot, while all around us is turbulence.And then it gets really strange.>HatWho the hell are you? In the chair in front of me is a straggly man in a leather hat and beads for clothes. He is staring at me through a hairy face and we're about to go live. I didn't even see him sit down, as though he entered the room through his own special trap door. Behind him is a circle of musicians, a rag bag mixture of middle-class hobos - I can imagine them playing the Bridgewater Hall then nicking your wallet on the way out.Lee passes me a blurb they have written about themselves. I think of questions to ask while scanning the blurb, as well as trying to maintain eye contact to keep them at ease. I learn this is a folk band comprising Greenbelt vets, but what I didn't know is they invaded the studio demanding half an hour air time. They get about two minutes, and then I feel guilty because they were very nice about it.>FuneralI felt relaxed behind the desk. Presenting is definitely for me. Greenbelt FM ask me to co-commentate on tomorrow morning's communion service. It is the prime presenting spot, like the BBC covering the Queen Mother's funeral.I say yes and then wonder how you commentate for two whole hours on Greenbelt's biggest event of the weekend. What do I say? And why do I keep thinking back to the pub the other night when I declared: \"I'm not going to that bloody communion service, this year.\"I begin to stress. And this is where things start to go horribly wrong..."},

Someone tells me in hushed tones that working for the on-site radio station means \"your time is no longer your own\". My lazy bone quivers with anxiety.I have already met the team on a training day, so there is little ice to break.

With a capital S.I suggest to Jackie, one of the more outspoken members of the BBC team, that we get the Ukulele Orchestra Of Great Britain into the studio. \"Get them into the studio\" isn't good enough. She throws paper clips, ring binders and mixing desks at my head and shouts: \"THAT'S NOT AN IDEA, COME BACK TO ME WHEN YOU'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA, THAT ISN'T A GOOD ENOUGH IDEAAARGH!\" And we're not even on air until tomorrow.Also on Thursday, I go to a general Greenbelt organisers meeting which is meant to be motivational, although the only thing I can remember thinking is that stewards with beards deserve more respect than stewards without beards. I get in a cheeky heckle (\"twenty-five!\") to a rhetorical question, the specifics of which are lost in the fabric of the night. >Grim realityFriday waltzes in to the room like it owns the place. We have another radio meeting first thing, and this time we face the grim reality that there are just four hours to prepare the first programme of the weekend's broadcast.This means generating content and lots of it. I run around interviewing random people about random things on a random hand-held recorder, until I am distracted by a cute baby goat eating a rake in the on-site children's farm, Miller's Ark. I consult my ABC Guide To The Food Chain and calculate, using a flow chart, that goats aren't meant to eat rakes. I tell it to stop eating the rake, and it trots over to my bit of the fence with a vague smile on its lips. I wonder if goats eat people, but it is too late as the stupid kid has wriggled under the perimeter fence - actually waggling its shoulders to give itself purchase against the bottom of the fencing - and it's ready to make a bolt for freedom. I panic. I grab the goat roughly with my left arm, while my right arm grabs the hand-held recorder from my pocket. I press record and, with casual yet goat-ish panache, to present a piece that eventally gets edited and put out on air. 'Greenbelt FM reporter catches goat.' Her name was Saffron, by the way. Hello, Saffron.The rest of the day is frittered away pre-producing other people's shows. This is laborious because it's like office work.>Vocal / loop heavenUnlike Gloopy Music, which was a welcome distraction at the end of the day. Stephen Devine took to the stage to lull an audience into vocal / loop heaven, in a kind of midnight mantra. It was my job to be a roadie and tech geek. It went well, although the audio on a Jim Morrison documentary clip didn't work. I was on stage when I realised the error, so I stood stock still and glared meaningfully at the mute black and white footage as though It Was Meant To Be That Way.Also on Friday, I discover the Barn Bacon Company's bacon and apple marmalade sandwiches.

I've worked at Greenbelt before, as a journalist in the 90s, but nothing quite compares to what I achieved at the weekend.It was an equally heavy and enjoyable experience. Heavy because of the workload and the ridiculous hours - 13 hours on the first day with two 15 minute breaks really is like being hit by a train.

I missed Sir Lord Bedingfield. I missed everything I wanted to see, and perhaps I'm most gutted about The Seven Basic Plots Of Storytelling and The Ukulele Orchestra Of Great Britain.But I did get to produce and present programmes, interview an escaped goat and Norman Kember (not together), live-commentate on a two hour event, and help run a brace late-night shindigs in the process. I also discovered a remarkable one-night cure for the common cold.>SerialI could keep waffling, and often do, but I'm going to pretend to be the Daily Mail and serialise my Greenbelt experience.So then, coming up next on 'notch 3' of my Fatbelt blogs will be me being shouted at by the BBC, me catching an escaped goat, and me standing on a stage wondering why Jim Morrison has lost his voice.

On the train there, a man gave me a look of death and then I realised he was staff and I was scared. Then there was the lady who told me all about her forklift driver sons who have just bought a house together in Grimsby, and I swear she had a knife behind her back.

Yes it has a McDonald's but it has retained a strong Welsh character.>Staring monstersI camped at the excellent Bagnol Caravan Park, where all the caravans seem to have net curtains and therefore no view. I was sharing the field with three pleasant for soccer fans; they listened to the wireless and said \"how do you do\" all the time (I think). And we were surrounded by strange wooden sculptures of staring monsters, which became all the more sinister since I couldn't get Venetian Snares' haunting Szamar Madar out of my mind.Oh bless, a SMALL BALL! On my second day on the island, I discovered a writing workshop with Janice Madden. She has just written a book about her Aunt who was murdered then exhumed for the head to be removed. It has taken her seven years of toil to get this book done, so I wish her every success.I meandered back home and chatted to all the interesting Irish people fresh off the ferry (I loved the Kerry man's story of storm waves hitting the side of his ship \"like an anvil\"). By this time, the only tune I had in my head was Smokey Robinson's Tears Of A Clown.What a wonderful carefree few days.

I learnt that you cannot add depth, and therefore engender sympathy, in a protagonist by having them vaguely traumatised by an incident from years ago. Strong characters comprise many past moments, and they carry with them multiple fears and hopes. Shoe-horning in a bit of claustrophobia is just weak.Welcome to The DaVinci Code movie, starring Tom Hanks who, yes, fell in a well as a child. He should have stayed there, because the 'Code is a calamitous mess of ill-thought theory and tedious plotting. >CrimesMy Photoshop rendering of the Dan Brown cover should say it all, really (edit: this refers to an image now long deleted I'm afraid). The crimes of this film are manifold.The dialogue is saggy; most scenes could have been half as long even before taking into account the golden rule of not drowning your character's lines in clumsy back-story exposition.The acting is pisspoor in places, with the French letting the side down thanks to the usually excellent Audrey Tatou and Jean Reno.The plot drives this movie at the expense of any character depth, which is a pain because that plot largely consists of bad puns such as \"Alexander Pope\" and \"a pope\". Oh look how they can get confused!>Damn cameraHalf way through the film I wondered when the damn camera would stop moving, obsessed as it was with tracking shots, pans, and authentic shakiness for running scenes, plane scenes, car scenes, any scenes really.The film is let down in so many details too: in just one moment of many dropped directorial balls, we are treated to a moment of infuriating deux ex machina when doves just happen to distract a gunman at a crucial point. I would have had Tom Hanks see the doves and clap his hands in the echoey church, therefore providing himself with a way out rather than relying on a chance happening. >HellishSir Ian McKellen is the saving grace in this hellish film; his character is tortured, funny and fascinating and it is a pleasure to be engrossed in a McKellen masterclass. He is worth the ticket price alone, although Paul Bettany's ice-cold Silas provides more than a few moments of dark glee.As someone who professes more than a passing interest in Christian teaching, it is not the theological mumbo jumbo I object to. It's such a weak film, the angels have nothing to fear. However, we are told in one of the numerous moments of exposition-through-dialogue that \"God does not forgive murder\".

Rabbits.>SteveThe children did know - the rabbit was called Kevin or Steve or Bubbles or something. So I left them to catch the rabbit while I hurried on to my appointment with a beer.I like to think I saved the life of that rabbit, although my parting glance didn't fill me with confidence: the two youngest children were tearing down the pavement after the startled bunny, all of them getting ever closer to the stream of traffic.Anyhoo, that's no excuse for not continuing with my Refresh FM posts as this happened yesterday while Refresh finished broadcasting a fortnight ago. But it is my excuse so shut up.>WagglesOn a bus a few moments after my bunny fun, I saw a piece of graffiti which said 'Chris waggles his bum at boys' and it occurred to me maybe they were writing about the rabbit. Which leads me to two conclusions: the rabbit wasn't called Kevin or Bubbles or something, and bunnies really do waggle their behinds in the cutest cutesy cute way. Aaaah!Did I just hear screeching tyres?*Far too many adjectives before 'stint'. Reminds me of a lazy BBC News 24 piece I heard this morning that blamed the destruction of homes on 'mudslide-causing heavy rainfall' which left me reeling for a few moments while I tried to figure out what had caused what to do what."},

It was only when we kept hearing random gunshots that we hauled Dan and radio director Andy Bell on air to apologise and lick our shoes.Tonight, we are back on the air from 9pm. I'm aiming on sticking in a bit of Sufjan Stevens, Arcade Fire, Bon Voyage and Shonlock.One week down and one to go.

Theatre Of Noise spilt itself over the airwaves last night after two years hiding in a cupboard from complaining Christians.I have fondness in my gills for this particular show, in the same way you would be more than a little thrilled if you had a little pixie living in your handbag. We played Christian guitar bands including Mae, Norma Jean and, um, Arctic Monkeys, but the show really came alive with our regular games.1) Wax LyricalThe beautiful Dan Dexter, radiant in his halo of hair, was pitted against me in a battle of Christian music knowledge. Because I had sold such music professionally for a number of years, I lost. Shurely some mistake? I had my leg waxed on air, which was more painful than expected because some dolt replaced the wax with gaffer tape.2) Chainsaw ChallengeIn an upside-down Jukebox Jury stylee, which I shall henceforth call Yruj Xobekuj, we voted for the worst Christian music from a beggar's choice of sub-standard CDs. Daniel Courtney, resplendent in lovely red shoes, did a great job damaging the losing CD with a power saw. Incidentally, the offending item was an album by Phillips, Craig & Dean. On their website, they ask the question \"Are you enjoying life right now?\" I suppose our metaphorical reply was \"take this, you mother\", which PC&D have done nothing to deserve other than spurn death metal in favour of their own brand of traditional snooze.Theatre Of Noise returns on 87.7FM Manchester next Wednesday at 9pm.

'Drill and bass' was a style of harsh techno pretty much invented for Aphex Twin, while De La Soul came up with 'daisy' to describe their flower-sniffin' anti-gangster rap. Even the guitar kids are at it: in Sydney, thrash metal dudes have called their local scene 'North Coast hardcore'.You too can create your own genre with this create-your-own-genre, um, creator. Have a go and be inspired. I got 'thrashgrass', which is something to with challenging a spliff at a game of mercy and winning convincingly because a spliff doesn't have opposable digits. Or any other digits, which makes most playground games a bit of a foregone conclusion.>Wishy washyI lovingly call my record box 'electronica', but this is wishy washy and covers Moby and Fatboy Slim and not the uncommercial complexity of the likes of Venetian Snares. Ishkur's excellent guide to electronic music says 'electronica does not exist' and credits Madonna for pretending it does.But wait! A quick Wikipedia search suggests I should call my style IDM or 'intelligent dance music'.IDM is unconventional electronic music that aims to play on people's preconceptions that all dance music should be structured, predictable and chart-friendly. A trawl though the history of IDM throws up names like Rephlex Records, Richard H Kirk, LFO, Boards Of Canada and Squarepusher. I am rubbing my hands in glee singing 'this is me! this is me! this is me!\"It also brings up names like Emotional Joystick. Someone really ought to be sitting in the corner of the classroom for that one.>Nasty IDMMy problem with the phrase 'intelligent dance music' is it's a bit like 'born again Christian'. It smacks of superiority. Even Aphex Twin once said: \"It's really nasty to everyone else's music,\" and he makes the nastiest music in the electroverse, so he should know.So what phrase can I use to describe this cerebral form of electronic music I have wet dreams about? I've head people use the phrase 'listening techno'. This is soggy and vague, like Channel Five, and anyone who uses it should be drowned in their own spittle. No. Other people's spittle.So electronica will continue to mean Chemical Brothers and Prodigy in the mind of the i-podding masses.

I'd never set ears on him before, but I heard a record being spun at Sometimes Records' Volume night on Thursday and nearly spilt my drink in dribbling glee. Excited about a man with an organ. There you go, bringing the tone down again.When Kubin was one hemisphere of German group Klangkrieg, he started his own label Gagarin Records to release what he called psycho sci-fi pop. It all seems quite DIY, and in that sense he seems to be a soul brother to Bill Drummond. In 1992, he created a pretend political party called KED or Kommunistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands if you're being formal. He then released a couple of singles as Liedertafel Margot Honecker to promote the party's policies. When the media attention became too much, LMH split. At the risk of typing too many triple-initials in one paragraph, I am bound to point out he would make the KLF proud.He seems inspired by pop sensibilities but doesn't stick to one media, experimenting with animation films and radio broadcasting. He brings a sideways approach to electronica and acoustic music, for example, he describes his radio piece Nachtspeicher (Night Storage) as \"club noise, field recordings, whispering silence, encounters with strange people and drunken angels.\" Beautiful!His website calls him a \"messenger of exploding lungs\" and indeed if you Google that phrase, he does seem to be the only messenger of exploding lungs out there. In the same way that if you Google \"trouser therapist\", you get this blog.

I bought into techno big time.I have been regressing back to those times a lot recently. I am turning into one of those Vietnam vets, hopefully like John Goodman in The Big Lebowski, rambling on about the old days while my friend's ashes are blown into Jeff Bridges' face.To help me with my reminiscing, Warp Records seem to be selling a lot of their chips for cheap. Among their newly-reduced merch are the following gems...(This is like an electronica version of Uncle Albert and his war stories, but stay with me...)>AFX : Hangable Auto BulbThis is the Aphex Twin and sometimes I prefer his AFX guise even though there is probably little difference. It contains tracks called Hangable Auto Bulb and Wabby Legs; its frantic breaks should be five years before their time but AFX makes them ten years ahead.> Autechre : UntitledSeriously stunning and astonishly original, every sound tweaked until it bleeds perfection.>Nightmares On Wax : Smokers DelightThe grown-up side of a lot of the stuff I was into in the 90s. I think they suffered from the whole \"trip hop\" thang and, hey, it was a lot cooler to be into the darker Ninja Tune joints out at the same time. Still, this album looks great in the cold light of today.>Plaid : TrainerA compilation of old Plaid tunes. Not as immediate as some of their densely catchy melodics of recent years, still, I can't believe they were producing music of this maturity so early in the 90s.>Polygon Window : Surfing On Sine WavesAphex Twin again, but now we're back to 1992 which is a very long time age because it's before Oasis and Aqua but not before Jesus Jones. There was something really expansive about this album, and I know I can make grown electronica heads cry by playing If It Really Is Me.> Sabres Of Paradise : Haunted DancehallNo not Sean Paul dancehall, but a strange haunted house dancehall full of dubbed out electronic breaks.

Autechre, the ultimate underground electronica outfit. Mobile phones, the ultimate tinny frog-puke enducing cancer machines. Who, how, why and whatfor?Electronica works for ads. Rick Lyon of Lyon Music makes music for adverts. He says \"more than 80% of music made for commercials has no vocals...\"Everything else about commercials, from the way they're cut, to the way they're shot, to the way they're written and directed, looks to the future. But the music is way behind.\"So the genre's futuristic sound works, and I would certainly prefer to hear Squarepusher in commercials than have the Crazy Frog waving his little green annoyance in my face.>Muller riceBack to the music I just heard. Autechre, Manchester's finest electronic genius since Alan Turing, have a track called Reniform Puls licensed to sell LG U3880 mobile phones (listen to Reniform Puls here [link now broken]).This is nothing new. In recent years, we have celebrated 30 years of the VW Golf with LFO and the Aphex Twin's Simon From Sydney. Boards Of Canada were used to sell BMWs, which I can understand since I once recommended the band for background music to a Songs Of Praise producer. BoC really can be that mainstream. I'm not too sure about using Orbital to sell Muller Rice, but it really did happen when The Saint was licensed for this purpose a few years ago. Or how about two more Aphex Twin tracks? The fantastic Windowlicker was used to shift Mercs in 2003, while Compaq used Aphex's Donkey Rhubarb.>Feel-good factorMusic has sold product on the airwaves since the swingin' 20s, only then it was wireless and orchestras instead of telly and techno. For this, we have to be thankful to the brim of our boots. Imagine a Minority Report world where adverts hard-sell us the latest teeth-rotting, purse-burning logo fodder. At least music mellows the message and reminds Mr Wile E Advertiser that us Roadrunners need feel-good advertising that isn't going to rub us up the wrong way. More car adverts and less Cillit Bang, please!The downside is that with the decline of the record industry, musicians know they can make a lot more manna strutting their stuff squashed between Fred Elliot, I say, Fred Elliot and Bette's hotpot, than on a dusty CD rack stuck between Madness and Madonna in Music Zone.>The case of MobyI remember the original release of Moby's Go which boasted an anti-car logo on its cover. Well, it wasn't so much a logo as a car crossed by a 'no smoking' red slash. When his Play came out many moons later, Moby's music probably sold a billion cars. Play shot the bedroom producer to fame and fast jets; it was the first time an album had every single one of its tracks used in either a feature film, television programme or an advert. The ads even had Tiger Woods playing golf to Find My Baby. Big names, big commercials, big cheques for Richard 'Moby' Hall.Does this make me feel uncomfortable? I'm not sure, but Moby seems happy with it. He explains: \"My feeling when I license music is that if I make a record and I'm proud of it, I want people to hear it - so I have to avail myself to sort of untraditional means to get people to hear my music.\">Ring Of FireStrangely enough, the advertising industry supports his assertion. Says Rick Lyons: \"People want to hear good music and people are receptive to good music when it's in [an advertising] spot.\" It did cheer me today when I heard The Fall being featured in a commercial. The track is Touch Sensitive and it's the Vauxhall Corsa ad that goes \"hey hey hey hey\". Yeah, that one.But advertising isn't, as Moby calls it, \"untraditional means\". It is as old as the hills, like prostitution, smoking and haemorroids.That reminds me of the best music/ad story ever. There was a plan afoot to use Johnny Cash's Ring Of Fire to sell haemorrhoid ointment. The ad muppets thought the words \"it burns burns burns, that ring of fire, that ring of fire\" would work just fine. The Cash family kaiboshed the idea: in the words of Johnny's daughter Rosanne, \"we would never allow the song to be demeaned like that.\">The future is harshMusic and advertising could still be a good thing. By having Autechre used as background slush, electronica could be reduced to muzak, forcing producers to explore more underground, more harsh forms of electronic music. Which puts the future of electronic music out of the hands of Moby and into the hands of Venetian Snares and Shitmat. This can only be a good thing... it just worries me that, like ringtones, the art is being cheapened in the meantime.Have fun matching adverts to music... click here for Commercial Breaks & Beats [link now broken] ."},

Thanks be to the gods that are Sometimes Records, particularly Maroogally and Pachuco for DJing.If anyone has photos of the electrical tape we used to make the floor look like a Tron 'circuit', please let me know.

I launched the Save Takuma Sato! campaign 26 days ago. Coincidence, methinkNO!Midland boss Colin Kolles is nicknamed Chavski because he thinks Burberry looks good and he has the manners of, erm, a chav. He also likes confusing his sporting analogies when talking about F1. He says of the contract: \"'The ball is in [Sato's] court. If he wants to sign it, he could be a Midland driver next year - we're waiting to hear.\"This is a resounding success for the Save Takuma Sato! campaign. Running this campaign has been a lot of hard work; the past 26 says have consisted of:- thinking about saving Takuma Sato;- eating crisps;- reading articles about Takuma Sato;- wondering what Japan is like;- watching Dr Who reruns on UK Gold;- licking pavements;- thinking about saving Takuma Sato.So as you see, I have put tremendous effort into the campaign. Takuma is currently prostituting himself in Hapan for corporate whores (ie doing PR work), whereafter he will go on holiday happy in the knowledge that the campaign continues for as long as crisps are 3 for 2 at my local newsagent."},

We had tried to get into Mr Scruff, but with just one doorman and a queue to rival Ikea on 'Two Square Bits Of Wood For The Price Of One' Day, we took a wander and ended up at Dry Bar.The band we saw were not entirely non-undisimilar to the Zutons, only more stoner and with a person 'Bez' dancing while adorned in a suit made of hands.  They are Misty's Big Adventure and they were massive fun.  They describe themselves as \"hip hop, scratching, screwy beats, pop and electric toys\".  One of their toys flashed.  Ooo.The second is a scuzzy garage rock band called M.A.S.S..  Their show was compelling mainly thanks to lead singer Justine, a frenzied 'Britney on heroin' (thanks Dan for that description).  I actually recognised one of their songs from the wireless, Hey Gravity, which Justine sang while standing on the bar at the other end of the venue from the stage, holding the microphone with one hand and smashing the hell out of the venue's piping with the other hand.  If the piping had burst, spewing effluent on the crowd, it would have been one of the less eventful moments in an a startlingly exuberant performance.  Apparently the Libertines love 'em as much as Docherty loves his Class As.I must make a note to check out more In The City gigs next year.  I'm off to find a piece of paper."},
{"title": "Save Takuma Sato!", "date": "Sep 26, 2005", "text": "In 2006, the famous privateers in F1 motor racing will be no more. Peter Sauber has sold Sauber off to BMW, Eddie Jordan's bright yellow will make way for the dull dark blue of Midland F1 and even Minardi are leaving F1 having given their team to Red Bull.Another massively important change in Formula One next year will be the absence of the Formula One Losers League, a fantasy league I have been running on the interwebular cyberspaceway. Without proper web support, I can't produce the all-singing all-prancing website I need to take the League to the next level.Perhaps the most upsetting change in '06, however, is Takuma Sato not getting a race drive. The cheeky little Japanese has wowed us with his inconsistency and crashes over the past few years, and despite his frankly dangerous driving style, he is the most successful Japanese F1 driver of all time.I have been watching the Brazilian grand prix. He came into the race demoted ten places on the grid for smashing wildly into Michael Schumacher two weeks ago. And he has just been demoted another ten places because of an engine change. There are only 20 cars in F1, so that's a pretty impressive penalty. I love Takuma Sato for exactly this.But BAR have dumped him in favour of grinning Brazilian Rubens Barrichello and some bloke called Jenson Button. It's been on the cards for some time - as Taku says, \"\"I am not surprised by todays confirmation about next year.\"But look on the bright side. He put in a near-perfect drive in Turkey, and I think it was the British GP where he produced a solid points finish in front of a British crowd for British American Racing.So what are Takuma's options? Test driver for BAR? Getting a seat in Jordan/Midland (like BAR, they have a Japanese engine, so national loyalty could play a part)?Whatever, Takuma Sato deserves a seat because:a) I have watched crap Japanese F1 drivers for years, and Taku has broken the mould;b) He performs like a rally driver, throwing his car around the track like a child with a Tonka;c) He's cute and I want to adopt him.Save Takuma Sato!"},

{"title": "Life, the Sanctiverse and everything", "date": "Jul 27, 2005", "text": "This following post is part of my response to ongoing discussions within my church, Sanctus1. it may or may not mean anything to you...For those worrying about where Sanctus1 is going, there is one thing we can be sure of. Sanctus will *not* become a prescriptive church that requires a sign-on-the-dotted-line minimum commitment if you are to be a ‘proper’ Sanctus member. Sanctus is not like that. Ben is not like that. The strategy group folk are not like that.But! I think there is something we need to be aware of as Sanctus that I may not be too popular for pointing out.Lost ordersThink back to Sunday’s service if you were there. It was a multi-media fest that was complicated and technical. I only turned up to do the sound desk and the DJing, but I was shattered afterwards. It was a lot of hard work for a small number of people. When the service finished, I hung around to chat to a few people before I started setting down the sound; pulling out wires, putting things away, trying not to let the speakers fall on my head, etc.As time went on, I realised the pack-down was not going as quickly as it usually does, so much so that by the time we had finished, the few of us who remained couldn’t possibly go to the pub. Pack-down had taken so long, we were staring down the barrel of last orders.You are not a muffinI am not suggesting that getting to the pub is an essential part of our Sunday services. Nor am I suggesting Sanctus1 is just a bunch of lazy muffins who don’t help to clear up after services. I think this happened because there were unusual circumstances: a few key people either weren’t there or a few key people had to get away.However, it was unfair that Ben, having planned and run the service and knackered himself out as a result, had to work his butt off putting everything away at the end. It was unreasonable that the people who were most heavily involved in the service were left to tidy up their mess by most Sanctus people (not all, thankfully).Which I think brings us back to getting practical, as Richard says. What if the Covenant Community idea gets knocked on the head because of the strong reaction to the leaflet that was sent out a few weeks ago? Where do we go from here?Where do we go, part 1: Shredding BenWe are a cool, chilled-out post-modern community that is led by the creativity and skill of its fuzzy-edged attendee-base. So why on Earth does Ben do most of the work? Why are we, in practice, almost totally led from the top?As Sanctus1 gets larger, we need to work to make Ben redundant. By that I don’t mean bribing the human resources folks in the Church of England offices into shredding his contract. Sanctus1 as a loving community needs to take on Ben’s role, which means leading the Wednesdays and Tuesdays, doing the services, etc. It will free Ben up to lead the vision of Sanctus and initiate or develop more things like Blah, II, the MBS fair, other missional stuff, etc.Of course, this relies on willing and discipline on Ben’s part to be let go of his role as it stands.Where do we go, part 2: Teenager vs badgerAlthough I sound as though I’m admonishing a lazy teenager, I will say this anyway. People should not have to be asked to do the washing up, to put the chairs away, to scrape the wax up from the carpet, or to carry the tray of cups to the smelly Methodist kitchen. Badgering the service organisers on Sunday and offering five minutes of your time would have meant the world. (Sorry to mention Sunday again. I’m not annoyed about it, it is just an observation – I am merely using Sunday as my ‘model’ to argue with!)I do recognise that a lot of people do these jobs a lot of the time, but not always and it’s often the same faces.Where do we go part 3: Venn I fall in love, it will be foreverRichard’s suggestion of fairly low-key Venn diagram group structures deserves some thought. If the idea of being led by these groups scares you, just remember that it already happens to some extent, it’s just that the groups are often not overtly identified (are Kolyn and I the II Group?).We arguably also need a group that identifies ways of getting people involved in S1 stuff that want to get involved, e.g. Claire doing some talky / discussion leading. I have really enjoyed the Wednesday evenings that have been led by other peeps – remember Stefan’s rapping?Where do we go part 4: Navel fluffI’m quite glad Richard suggested thinking in more concrete terms. We must move this discussion on because as long as we are navel gazing we are distracting ourselves from first-priority stuff like God and our relationship with God and our missional focus, etc. Not that the discussion shouldn’t be a priority, as I think it’s necessary and we are going through all-important growing pains, but we need to arrive somewhere.One thing that struck me at Blah… was we can spend too much time discussing about ‘secondary’ things in the kingdom, so we need to manage our debate sensibly (which I think is achieved very effectively by Blah…).Let’s enjoy a multitude of stimulating discussions during this Covenant-themed summer, but do remember that we are trying to move things forward, and do please please let your voice be heard.Wishy-washy disclaimerIf I didn’t go to Sanctus1, I wouldn’t go anywhere. I love the people in it and around it. I hope I have not been too critical or too judgemental. If so, it was a bad turn of phrase and was not intended. I have deliberately not edited my text above so I do not water down what I’m saying (I can become so appeasing, I can disappear easily into diplomatic nothingness). Also, I have not covered everything nor am I ever likely to.I am surrounded in S1 by very committed and loving people, and I’m so glad it is you lot I am discussing with. Please respond, criticise, call for my summary execution, or gush [delete as appropriate].Time for breakfast.PS – my red-underline intrusive spell check thingy says ‘missional’ is not a word."},

It's a Losers League, see?You don't have to be good at F1 to have a go. In fact, it helps to be bad. Very bad.All you need is an internet connection and £5.Go, go, go... http://www.f1losers.co.uk/"},

A little cold, but considering the whole thing was organised within a week, it was a triumph.Thanks to Mike Fallows, graphic design genius in residence at Sometimes Records, and to Stephen Devine.  Both impressed more than a break-dancing Thora Hird.Fil and Kol did a really good job with the visuals, even if Kol said there was 'something missing' and Fil didn't get his Highly Technologistic Gizmo working.  Something must have gone right, because I took this photograph (below).And thanks to Ben and all of Sanctus1 for supporting the event.

The dealer would have been delighted to rejoin his notorious gang which included Paul Bennett, also released by Howard, and speed dealer Simon Bakerman.Bakerman's cousin is thought to have had a lot to do with Haase's release.

{"title": "Gig review: Stephen Devine, Night & Day café, November 15th 2004", "date": "Nov 23, 2004", "text": "It’s not unusual for me to walk out of the Night & Day £3-a-bottle the poorer and my ears bleeding like the lifts out of the Shining.  It’s normally because I have seen a band so distatefully dire, I want to go home and dance to my food blender.\r\rFortunately, this didn’t happen until the fourth band tonight.  I don’t know their name and I don’t care, as they made Maroon 5 sound like Slayer.\r\rThe third band were excellent, however, with a stack of good songs, a rack of exaggerated hair and a nice line in stooping.  It’s such a shame they were called Fans Of Kate.\r\rMeanwhile, the first band were called the Likes.  They were a macho Coral whose lead singers had voices so low, I swear to this day they were transmitting subliminal orders to buy badges from their badge stand.  Yes, a badge stand.  What the Likes lacked in personality, they more than made up for with effects pedals.  Bless.\r\rNo it’s the second band, or rather soloist Stephen Devine, I was here to see tonight.  One man and his acoustic guitar couldn’t have been more out of place than if Divine himself had waddled onto the stage.  At least Stephen had a sampler as an extra ‘band member’.  And yes he really did introduce his ‘band’.\r\rDevine (the non-drag one) opened with Do You Think They Know and yes it does start off sounding a bit like the Levellers, but this is ditched pretty promptly with a sequence of sometimes haphazard chords and an ending of such volume and intensity, you could actually see his tonsils.\r\rCan You Wait was the first track to showcase his layered guitars party trick, sampling and looping as he goes to create a rich acoustic mantra with more nods to Underworld than anyone of the singer-songwriter ilk.  The song was spoilt, however, by a plebeian sound engineer with mud in his ears; the crucial bass drum was lost.  The song also sounded a little rushed, losing the sense of space that makes Devine’s experimentalism work so well.\r\rHelp Me, a desperately quiet anti-anthem of tortured desire is one of those Really Good Tunes that puts a flag on Devine’s song-writing talents and waves it as though the Queen’s in town.  “I just want to go hooome with you” he pleads before telling you he’s bleeding and his tragic heart is broken.  Talk about needy.  The simplicity of this song speaks for itself, and no amount of mud in anyone’s ears could mess this one up.\r\rThe wistful vibe was carried into Comfort Me, the title track from his CD.  It takes some courage to sing so quietly into the hip void of the Night & Day.  It doesn’t work as well as Help Me, and sits the artist firmly in the singer-songwriter vein when I suspect his blood should be pumping down more experimental arteries.\r\rWhich brings us to Slow Down, his opus, his epic, his big tool that wrenches conversation into submission.  The sound man has nipped to Boots for cotton buds just in time for an ever-so-simple quiet song that loops and builds and layers until it’s funking out like the Chili Peppers and Devine is spinning around on the spot like, er, Kylie Minogue.  Here we have a singer possessed by everything Stephen ought to be about: repetition, beauty, simplicity and passion.\r\rThis is the sound of someone still looking for completeness in his music, with the result that some songs are better than others, and some songs’ mothers are better than other songs’ mothers.  But he found that completeness at the end, leaving us wanting more and not begging for the strange rhythms of our food blenders.\r\rWhich is divinity in itself, I suppose."},
{"title": "Facing Up: Japanese Ann Widdecombe?", "date": "Nov 22, 2004", "text": "I've just seen a pilot episode of a new ITV1 comedy called Facing Up.\r\rIt stars Mark Heap (Spaced, Green Wing) as a celebrity impersonator who clearly resents the famous person he is making a living off. Along with a will-he won't-he friendship with Samantha Janus, he is mates with a Twister-obsessed Rod Stewart impersonator. He works for an agency run by a man called Harvey who never seems to be quite in control of events, played to perfection by John Thompson.\r\rI'm not sure when it will be on the tellybox, but it's worth a look-in. (Remember Look-In?) Facing Up is not as original as Green Wing, and not as clever as Spaced, while Heap deliberately plays down the ridiculous characters he played on both of those series.\r\rBut just to persuade you to watch it, here are the five funniest moments in the pilot episode, in no particular order:\r\r1. Japanese Ann Widdecombe?  That's the Yes pile.\r\r2. The dinner party conversation, from \"Glue?\" to \"I love David Hasselhoff\"\r\r3. The intrusive Gandalf impersonator\r\r4. Constant put-downs for Celine \"yammering fishwife\" Dion\r\r5. John Thompson running off in the background, cartoon style, at the end of the episode.\r\rWho needs fluffy celebrity gossip magazines when you have me?  Facing Up.  You heard it on the Fat Roland Blog first.\rHere's an update on what's happening downstairs in Cord bar, Northern Quarter, Manchester on December 1st, 8pm until 11pm (admission free!).\r\r'Two' will be the name of the night. The event is set to be a great showcase for Fats friends and fans alike, with visuals supplied by Squeaky Productions cohort Fil (aka Weasel) and Altaer master Kol (aka Krow), plus a DJ set by Kid Mingus (aka Kid Mingus).\r\rKid Mingus will be showcasing tracks from his new mini-album Unhappy House (the best track title is Sting Loves Me). To hear the mini-album in full, go straight to the Defunktion website by clicking here. The music will automatically start streaming shortly after the page loads.\r\rBrought to you by Sanctus1, the evening of electronica and creative visuals should also feature live experimental music courtesy of a laptop PC artist, but details are still being sorted."},

Voices With Soul got voted out of the X-Factor. They were clearly the best performers there, as this brief precis of the remaining contestants shows:\r\ra) Rowetta = mad as hatter\rb) Steve = smug Michael Bolton\rc) G4 = Richard Clayderman with voices instead of a piano\rd) Thingy = Stereophonics\re) The other one = who?!?\r\rVWS believe in Jesus. They even changed the lyrics of their song to make it holier. Who said they had put on the best performance of the series and therefore cursed them forever? Sharon Osbourne, who is in fact married to the devil.\r\rThis isn't the first time this has happened. God-lover Gareth Gates lost out to Will Young, who is one of them homosatchels. Apparently he smiles at other men. Gates reacted to the defeat by defiling Jordan, which is a very important river in the Bible.\r\rEven Jesus' best friend, Cliff Richard, came second in the 1968 Eurovision song contest to a ditty called La La La, and we all know what \"la la la\" means don't we?!?! (No - Blogger ed)\r\rWill the only successful Christian musician continue to be just Daniel Bedingfield? Or will the Cheeky Girls get converted? Only time will tell, but there isn't a lot of it left and I can hear trumpets in the distance...\r\r...oh no, my mistake, it's just bloomin' 2 To Go."},
