       "'STICKIED much debate   ( and some requests )   I have signed up with crowdfunding service to better support future blogging efforts . You can find my page here and more information after the jump . After a lengthy break   ( six years since the last version ) , the   ( non- )   patented , utterly non - definitive Wertzone Official SFF All - Time Bestseller List returns . There have been some changes this time . The last list was gettingon for   entries strong , and unreliable and variable reporting meant thelower of the list had more holes in it than cheese after beingvisited by lactose - loving moths , due to patchy reporting . I have limited the numbered list to authorswith copies sold for the sake of sanity . I have left in theremainder of the list from last time , but take those positions and sales figures with a pinchof salt the size of . The usual string of caveats : reporting of sales for authorsis bizarrely spotty , with some authors happy to broadcast their sales , some guardingtheir figures with incredible tenacity and others happily admitting they donthave a clue what they are , reliant on intermittent reporting by variouspublishers across the world . There is also frequent confusion over books sold , books in print   ( i.e. the number of books that are currently sitting unsold onshelves or in warehouses across the world )   or sales - per - book , which can sometimes lead to conflicting information . There is also tremendous lag , with reports sometimes being many years behind sales themselves . Some of the sales figure sources are brand - new , some are a few years old and some are twenty years old with absolutely no interest from the publishers in updating them . The sources for the list are therefore all over the place   ( but noted where possible ) .Still , some interesting trends can be discerned : the rise of \" \" is quite notable , with a massive explosion of sales for , whose sales growth is eclipsing almost everyone else in the field   ( she \\'s catching up like a freight train ) , and newcomer selling around . copies in a year , which is the type of explosive debut we have n\\'t seen this side of . and younger category sales also remain a huge deal , with the enormous sales growth of the series being particularly eye - popping . Traditional epic fantasy still does quite well but at a much lower level , with solid growth for the likes of , , and . remains a strong outlier , and is doing pretty well for someone who passed away seventeen years ago , with recently joining the   million+ club .

Legacy sales for the series remainstrong but seem to be dropping ; her reported sales in   are not dramaticallyhigher than in , and her once - thought - unreachable position does seem to bein reach of several other authors .

Confirming what was rumoured last year , the   reboot project is officially dead at the . The has focused its attention away from drama towards cheaper television fare . As also expected , has not junked the project entirely but , after regaining the rights , is now shopping the project to streaming services , with apparently showing interest . Original   creator , showrunner and head writer remains attached to the project . Which streaming services are interested is as yet unknown . The most logical option ,   ( recently retitled just ) , is seemingly out of the question because they have their own budget and development issues in the wake of their recent merger   ( of the few shows to survive the merger process , Our Flag Means Death , was cancelled last week ) . proper do not seem interested , despite the presence of self - confessed   fan in the development process there . has excellent relations with , and is currently producing the live - action show for them . showrunner - producer is a good friend of \\'s , and wrote an episode for the original   way back in . of \\'s myriad alien races , the Gaim , is named for him . himself has a relationship with , having co - produced the first two seasons of for them almost a decade ago . also lacks a high - profile , ongoing , live - action space opera at the moment . are also a possibility , as they currently lack a space opera show after the cancellation of a couple of years ago . Other streamers seem to be well set - up for space opera : has multiple Star Wars shows in development and recently added The Orville to its streaming lineup , whilst is veritably drowning in content , not to mention Halo . TV+ has For All Mankind and Foundation as ongoing space - based shows . An intriguing possibility is , an ad - supported streaming service which began operation in   and has over   million users in . Tubi is predominantly available in and , but issues have seen it unable to launch in the and . Tubi has been airing   itself for the past few months . Tubi mostly airs content from other supplies , but has aired some original programming , including the animated comedy , a cooking show , the second season of The   ( after it was dropped by ) . Tubi has voiced an ambition to create more original content for its service , and   might be an attractive franchise , especially if can work his magic like it \\'s   all over again to produce the show on a competitive budget . More news as it comes in . After many years of speculation , has updated their websites and pages to confirm that the television series which aired on from   to   are now officially counted as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe . As originally spotted by CanWeGetSomeToast here . The TV series have been unofficially called verse \" or some other derivative , due to \\'s prior reluctance to rule on their canonical status . The shows aired as part of a deal between , and , but which did not include MCU guiding light as part of the decision - making process . The line of shows did not stick around for very long - just four years - but produced a stunning amount of content in that time :   episodes airing across   seasons in distinct shows . Although each season stood alone , there were some shared characters and motifs which culminated in the event mini - series Defenders , which saw Daredevil , , and join forces against a mutual threat . The Punisher , which had not been originally planned , spun out of the character \\'s well - received guest role in the second season of Daredevil . With planning to launch its own rival streaming service to in the shape of , the deal was cancelled in . The contract required to wait two years before developing their own versions of those characters , but when the time came they intriguingly used the same actors . reprised his role as in , whilst reprised his role as Daredevil in the film and then the Disney+ series She - Hulk and . , and as the Punisher will all reappear in Daredevil : Born Again , currently in production . Despite this , some believed that these actors were nonetheless playing \" new \" versions of the characters , not necessarily the same ones we saw on . Fortunately , it appears that finally realised that was too weird and confusing . By officially canonising the shows and moving them into a more prominent slot on , they may also be hoping to pick up some fresh views . This also possibly opens the door to reprising her role as , as well as as , as   ( I mean , if you really want to ) , as and as . The other shows which aired on are still not listed in the official timeline , including , Runaways and   ( in the last case , that may be for the best ) . Their fans may hold out some hope that they may yet be reunited with the main timeline . - verse in : Season    (   ) : Season    (   ) Daredevil : Season    (   ) : Season    (   ) Iron Fist : Season    (   ) The Defenders   (   ) The Punisher : Season    (   ) : Season    (   ) : Season    (   ) Iron Fist : Season    (   ) Daredevil : Season    (   ) The Punisher : Season    (   ) : Season    (   ) scriptwriter has sadly passed away at the age of .

Reeves , obviously , is an acclaimed and iconic actor best - known for playing the titular character in the franchise   ( now at films and a prequel TV show ) , in the Matrix movies and in the video game Cyberpunk   and its recent expansion , . BRZRKR is a -issue limited series focusing on an enigmatic warrior character called the , who is immortal and fights his way across time .

News has sadly broken that veteran game designer has passed away at the age of . was the co - founder of and the boss of in the s and s , particularly the period when , was launched . was a hands - on boss and worked on books and material for both the fantasy and K universes . was born in   and became a key fan of science fiction , fantasy and wargaming at a young age . He sculpted his miniature - a guardsman of - in   after reading J.R.R. \\'s The Lord of the . A few years later he acquired a pyrogravure heat pen and set about converting figures produced by into hordes of orcs . Ansell further developed his artistic skills as a teenager and began sculpting models for wargaming , earning him a job at and then . At he worked on the Age of range . He was inspired to start his own company , , in , along with and . Whilst at Asgard he met and worked with , , and . In   and his friend created the wargame system , with a edition following in .Ansell left Asgard in   to found rival miniatures company , with funding from gaming company . began churning out large numbers of generic figures for use with roleplaying games , particularly   ( to which Games Workshop held the exclusive distribution rights ) . The company initially focused on fantasy figures but also branched out to science fiction , producing figures for the roleplaying game and then the TV series Doctor Who . was notable for not just his sculpting skills but also his business acumen , and he noted that from the sales patterns that people were buying some of the more generic figures - orcs , dwarves , elves - in large numbers , enough for entire regiments . This suggested they were playing full - on wargames with the figures , not just the very small skirmishes allowed for by roleplaying games . The suggestion was made for Games Workshop to create their own wargame , drawing on their immense catalogue of figures rather than having to invent things from scratch . Based on their work on , brought in and to design a new game that could make use of their existing range . The result was , published in   and an immediate success story . A edition followed in .Ansell contributed creatively to the worldbuilding for Warhammer by working on the and Orc factions , and created the infamous . In   founded as a spin - off company run by his father after his retirement . Ansell instigated a buyout of in   and an effective merging of and into a single company . oversaw a series of sustained growth for the company , through the expansion of the Warhammer line and then the introduction of Warhammer , in . Like , the , line drew on \\'s immense pre - existing figure line and even modifications of the fantasy line , sometimes literally taking orcs and removing their swords and bows in exchange for guns . As the line became hugely successful in its own right , bespoke models were introduced . also redirected all Games Workshop offices and entities to be based in . As the years passed , ex - GW employees would found their own companies nearby , leading to shared vendors and resources , creating an area known as the \" , \" the centre of the   ( and arguably )   warming scene . Towards the end of his tenure saw the further expansion of the company , with the profile of their games raised by a strategic alliance with which resulted in the board games   (   )   and   (   ) , as well as their forays into video games . However , also directed the company to drop its work with other games and focus almost all of its creative efforts on the Warhammer and Warhammer , brands , with its associated magazine also becoming solely focused on the company \\'s own games rather than the hobby at large . This move was criticised by some employees and some critics in the hobby at large . Ansell left Games Workshop in   to focus on his family and returning to his love , of sculpting miniatures . He established in , transforming it into a new incarnation of in . The new company specialised in historical figures with some elements . retired from the company in , but mismanagement led to him returning in . A new company , Casting Room , was set up to help ease the problems and bring in new models . A further company , , was set up in   to sell exclusively fantasy figures . was an integral part of the Games Workshop story , and his combination of creative and business inspirations led to the company \\'s mass expansion in the s and early s , and the creation of Warhammer , . He left an indelible mark on the wargaming industry , and can be credited with transforming it , turning into a world - leader in the miniatures field . He will very much be missed . Having narrowly escaped from an encounter with the feared necrons , finds himself assigned as liaison to chapter , noted for their formidable weaponry , immense bravery and sometimes over - eager interest in technology . When rebel insurgents launch an uprising on against the local government , fancies they are in for an easy campaign against an inferior foe . Of course , it \\'s not long before genestealers abound , and finds himself stuck with an overeager noble lady keen to ensnare him in political games , and a hellbound pursuit of a rogue hulk through deep space . The misadventures of are probably among the most purely entertaining in the Warhammer , canon . Whilst most books focus more on the \" grim darkness \" and \" only war \" bits of the setting , signature series instead tries to lighten things up , at least relatively . believes himself to be blustering , cowardly and too eager to run at the sign of trouble , but is constantly manoeuvred by fate into positions where he has no choice but to apparently - eagerly run to the front lines or into the most dangerous area possible , often surviving by the skin of his teeth and sometimes unexpectedly saving the day in such an outrageously public way . By this novel in the series , things have gotten ludicrous enough that is now getting full honour salutes from squads of for his bravery   ( roughly akin to an angel saluting a particularly tenacious chimpanzee ) .Of course , \\'s complaints about his cowardice and self - serving needs do seem to be contradicted by his actual proven ability to get tasks achieved and his impressive combat skills , and his constantly - present   ( via footnotes of varying degrees of bewilderment )   editor - confessor , , seems unsure about to what degree his \" confession \" is actual modesty , or even some psychological defence mechanism to rationalise a deeper - seated need to face death on a daily basis . This deep in the series it \\'s a still a mystery   ( one I doubt will ever be solved ) , so it \\'s probably best to move on and enjoy the ride . The Emperor \\'s Finest is , like most books in the series , fairly short but also packs a ton in . The book has distinct sections , which less - disciplined authors might have tried to expand into a whole novel by themselves . The battle for is entertaining , with acting as a liaison between the superhuman and the ordinary human defenders , and getting into a Warhammer , meetcute   ( which means moderate flirting over the roaring exchange of bolter fire )   with the governor \\'s daughter , . A slightly more interminable middle section follows as the try to track down the origin of the tyranid infestation , a space hulk cheerily named , whilst tries to both win the respect of the and fend off \\'s attempts to lure him into political intrigue . The final section sees ,   ( \\'s aide , think of the product of an unholy union of and )   and the let loose aboard the space hulk and finding things are far more complicated then they imagined . delivers this with typical panache , with moments of humour and levity mixed in with above - competent action sequences and \\'s wry footnote interjections . However , the formula feels a tad off this time around . After a promising start , never really develops into an interesting character and her storyline feels a bit rote . \\'s interactions with the and their crewmembers also hold a lot of promise but again are not fleshed out well : \\'s achievements in the book   ( from an outside )   are highly impressive but I \\'m not sure he \\'s done enough to earn the \\' overwhelming respect at the end . is also at his best when in circumstances with lots of options for his natural self - serving tendencies to emerge and the reader to be left in doubt about his selfish / brave motivations . Here he spends of the book trapped on a space hulk with his back to the wall and no choice but to proceed to survive , which makes for a solidly tense adventure but does n\\'t service the character \\'s best attributes . Still , the book is short , to the point , has good action and some doses of light humour that the setting rather badly needs at time , so it \\'s hard to complain too much . The Emperor \\'s Finest   ( * * * )   delivers the required entertainment , but does n\\'t go above and beyond like the better books in the series .

An alliance with a faction outside the city provides salvation , but at a price that is not willing to pay . a Sal is a princess of the city , the daughter to the heir apparent to the throne . Moving into the palace for the time , she uncovers mysterious secrets that she should - but can not - let go . Elaine and \\'s destines entwine with those of a city watch captain and the ruler of the city \\'s criminal underground , and a tumultuous year continues to turn around the great city of . is latest fantasy work . The co - author of the Expanse space opera series and the solo author of and the Dagger and the Coin series , has long been praised as an author of character - based fantasy with interesting , original worlds and forms of magic . This trilogy takes a new approach , with books set in the same city at the same time but involving different characters , sort of a fantasy version of classic Colours film trilogy . Each story more or less stands alone but reading the whole trilogy results in greater understanding of the epic events unfolding under the surface : each book has a piece of the puzzle that becomes clear when all are read . Balancing this metaplot with the needs of the book at hand can be tricky , and the book in the triad , Age of Ash , did not always succeed in doing so . It remains an excellent book but there was a greater feeling that you did n\\'t have all the pieces of the puzzle . Blade of Dream is much more successful in crafting a compelling narrative on its own as well as working as part of a broader whole . The story this time is perhaps a tad more traditional fantasy . is the young man unsure of his station and ambitions who rebels against the stifling destiny his family want to force on him . Elaine is the noblewoman likewise unsure of her station who has few friends she can trust , as opposed to those who want to take advantage of her station . They are thrust together by circumstances and find a new way forwards , through political intrigue , back - alley stabbings and full - on conflict between the city guard and a criminal organisation . Blade of Dream is literally a \" higher \" book than Age of Ash , taking place in the mercantile and royal districts whilst Age of Ash was more at home in the downmarket slums . Blade of Dream certainly works as a far above - average example of a medieval   ( ish )   city - set fantasy , but it \\'s also a powerfully emotional book . delves into his characters \\' heads to craft very - dimensional and interesting protagonists , and what drives and motivates them . I \\'ve occasionally mused that could be the closest author we have to becoming a natural heir of , but that feeling is hugely intensified by this book . The traditional fantasy trappings could be dropped altogether and this would still work wonderfully as a character study . But those traditional fantasy trappings are here , and realised well with a compelling mystery and some fascinating worldbuilding . Blade of Dream   ( * * * * )   is an improvement on its forebear and marks this trilogy as \\'s most mature and interesting work yet . The final novel in the trilogy , with the working title Judge of , is due out next year . Thank you for reading .

The deal will cover Games \\'s popular Warhammer , science fantasy setting and will allow to develop multiple television and film projects based on games and novels , both live action and animated . have also confirmed that everybody \\'s favourite geek - thespian , , will play a key role in their projects as producer , creative overseer and actor in of the properties .

Chief among the \\'s defenders are the Space Marines , genetically - engineered super warriors in towering power armour . The franchise began in   as a tabletop wargame , which remains the biggest - selling property in the genre , but has since branched out to over   works of original fiction , including novels , comics , audio dramas , animated films and video games .

Eisenhorn remains a reasonable starting point for the franchise , with a cast consisting of mostly human characters with only occasional appearances by   ( the signature faction of the setting )   and daemonic forces .

Born in , , began acting on - screen in the late s and by the mid - s had started being cast in leading roles . He starred in TV shows including , and As the World Turns . In   he was cast as the voice of video game character , in the video game of the same name from . was the narrator as well as the star , and had more dialogue than everyone else in the game put together . \\'s world - weary delivery , influenced by every hard - bitten detective noir story ever written , was pitch - perfect and won him an immediate legion of fans . returned to the role for : The Fall of   (   )   and    (   ) , and also had a cameo in the disappointing movie   (   ) .James   ( left )   with   ( lead writer at and the face of in the original game )   and   ( the voice of )   in November .McCaffrey later starred in as and became a perennial guest star on television and a reliable supporting player in films . continued their association with by casting him as , a fictional detective clearly based on   ( whom they could n\\'t use for copyright reasons )   in   (   ) .

For Sir , this was not an option . Having experimented with a book for younger audiences , , he decided to start a whole new sub - series within the wider Discworld framework that would be aimed primarily at younger readers . Pratchett being , this meant relatively little changes or compromises to his usual vision . Some of the very occasional double entendre gags are gone , the book is somewhat shorter than usual , but beyond that did n\\'t really censor himself at all . If anything , this is a more thoughtful , contemplative book than the norm , with some enjoyable setpieces interrupted by \\'s internal musings on life and her ambitions . is smart , curious and sensible , not given to recklessness but also having a strong moral centre . She may be a quintessential Discworld protagonist , being often the only sane person in the room and constantly wondering why selfishness and hatred even exist . She is cut from the same competence cloth as and , but lacks their experience and cynicism . She is a well - drawn protagonist who has to overcome problems presented by capable enemies , rather than because she \\'s holding an idiot ball   ( something many other writers could learn from ) .What is impressive about is how much of it is told from within \\'s head : the are not given to in - depth dialogue   ( although they have a few bon mots of wisdom )   and many of the other characters are evil , monsters , stupid adults or even less - communicative children . Just about the only person can have a decent : conversation with is a sentient toad . This means we get to lock into thought processes and motivations in a lot of depth , which is refreshing . Taking part in a hitherto - unexplored part of the Disc with almost no recurring characters   ( not even Death , making this the Discworld novel that he skips out on ) , at least until the last chapter , also makes a viable on - roading point for the entire series . Technically the main villain did   ( briefly )   appear in and Ladies , but that is really not alluded to in the book so is not hugely important .   ( * * * * )   sheds a lot of the extended subplots that had started padding out the books around this time and is focused and entertaining , with a small but well - drawn cast of characters . It \\'s funny , but intermittently , with musings on growing up and responsibility .

Braugher passed away on   December from an undisclosed , short illness . He is survived by his wife and children . He will absolutely be missed . On   December , aired a - part TV movie based on   space opera , . This new show had been preceded by very low expectations : none of the cast or crew of the original show was involved , and previous reboot pitches which had been direct sequels to the original show had been cancelled in development . Redesigns of iconic ships and vehicles had annoyed the original fanbase , as had the \" gender - swapping \" of established characters like and . However , early critical reviews were positive and some of the casting for the show , such as as the new version of Commander   ( in the role played by in the original )   and as the new President of the , seemed promising . A promotional image for season   ( - ) .The road to relaunching had been a long one . had commissioned to create the original show back in , keen to jump on the bandwagon of space opera and impressive visual effects generated by the release of the original Star Wars movie . They even brought in , who had created Star Wars \\'s special effects , to work on the show . Borrowing heavily from mythology and theology , the show told the story of the annihilation of at the hands of a hostile alien race , the , consisting of cyborg leaders and fully - robotic soldiers . The last surviving human warship , the battlestar , leads a \" ragtag fugitive fleet \" in search of the mythical Thirteenth Colony , also known as . Despite schmaltzy acting , the presence of cute kid and animal actors   ( including the still - bizarre decision to have a chimp playing a robot dog )   and whiplash - inducing shifts in tone , the show built up a strong following for its impressive effects and its emphasis on family . The show launched to enormous ratings , but these fell drastically over the course of the first season . Combined with the show \\'s eye - watering cost , decided to cancel it and resurrect it two years later as , a much lower - budged show meant more to appeal to kids .   holds a strong claim to be the worst TV show ever made   ( with the solitary exception of a flashback episode set during the original series timeline )   and was quickly put out of its misery . The original had spectacular visual effects for   but less impressive scripts . moved on to other projects , but always felt there was more mileage in the concept . , who \\'d played on the original series , agreed , and with \\'s blessing undertook various attempts to relaunch the show . Successful novel and comic series followed through the s and s , and in   produced a proof - of - concept video dubbed : . Ignoring Galactica , this would have been a \" next generation \" concept picking up on the story twenty years later with the crew still searching for with a whole new generation growing up in the fleet . Despite being popular at fan conventions , the idea did not find fertile ground with a studio . A year later started developing a movie concept which would have followed up on the fate of the battlestar Pegasus from the original series , but again this did n\\'t get very far . A much more serious attempt followed in . Producers and were the hot flavour of the month in for the success of their movie X - Men and Singer , a huge fan of the original , was determined to get the show launched again . His concept was similar to \\'s and would have been a next generation reboot . signed on , but were somewhat sceptical that \\'s relatively small fanbase could help propel the show to a larger audience , especially as it was a continuation . Nevertheless , the project moved to within a few weeks production starting   ( including some early set construction and lots of concept art being produced )   when put all new projects on hold in the wake of the / terrorist attacks . were slow to get the show moving again , so when and left the project to focus on the next X - Men movie , let the idea lapse . Promotional artwork for and planned Battlestar reboot   (   ) .Universal Pictures , who held the rights to the original , decided to push forwards with a new version of the show themselves . Whilst / had disrupted \\'s plans , Universal saw it as an opportunity to tell a very different kind of story . Critics of the original - and even some fans - had felt that the original series had massively undersold the darkness and trauma that would have resulted from the destruction of planets and of lives on the survivors . Universal asked producer to work on ideas for the new series , but the directive was that this was going to be a page rewrite and remake set in a new continuity . decided he needed to bring on board someone who really understood science fiction , and in particular space opera , and called a writer he knew . Moore had cut his teeth as a very young writer on , which he \\'d joined in   in its third season . He was just about the only staff writer to survive the chaotic season into the , and became a key creative lead on the show in its latter five seasons . When the show wrapped , he co - wrote the movies and First Contact as well as moving over to for its third season , again playing a key creative role on that show . When wrapped in , he moved over to : Voyager but immediately found a much more restrictive creative environment . Moore was in particular frustrated by the fact that the starship was still clean and pristine despite being trapped on the other side of the galaxy with very limited chances for resupply or repairs . His feeling was that the show should have been darker , more challenging and engaged in more morally murky discussions about the morality of the Federation when a ship was put in a difficult position . The showrunners disagreed , feeling that cookie - cutter philosophising and constantly hitting a big red reset button at the end of every episode was the way forwards instead . Moore duly quit , going to work on at the and then Carnivale at HBO.Executive producer and showrunner on the hanger set of . He was still working on Carnivale when called . Moore had watched when it aired and seen great promise in it , but had also disliked the campy and sillier elements of the show   ( such as the cute kids , robots and the \" casino planet \" in the pilot ) . He rewatched the pilot movie and realised there was a lot of strength in the basic premise and agreed that it could be reworked in a post-/ environment for greater emotional impact . He agreed to write a new pilot for \\'s subsidiary ,   ( now ) . This ballooned into a   ( relatively )   high - budget three - hour mini - series which could also work as a backdoor pilot for a full series . Moore penned the pilot and oversaw some elements of production , including exercising his desire for a slightly darker aesthetic than and to have a completely new   ( for )   way of shooting the action with handheld cameras , even the space scenes . Director immediately locked into what was thinking of and his directorial style immediately became a hallmark of the show . Moore also wanted a more understated and less symphonic way of doing music for a space series and lucked out when also picked up that idea and ran with it . A young composer named assisted on the pilot . as Commander and as President . Casting proved interesting but controversial . Moore wanted distinct actors with gravitas and experience , but was aware that it was very unusual for producers to get their choices . In this case , he wanted for and for and was flabbergasted when both said yes , sold on the quality of the scripts . The casting department also scored a steady series of successes when they found a lot of fresh young talent for the series , from for to for and , most iconically , as and former model as . Established fans of the show were furious to learn that both and   ( to be played by )   had been changed from male characters to a female one for the show and some of the original castmembers agreed with them :   ( who played in the original show )   scathingly referred to the new character as \" Stardoe\" . For visual effects , the team at were called in to produce the huge amount of needed for the mini - series . Zoic had just come off the back of newly - cancelled so the commission was good news for them . The team included many veterans of both   and , who relished on rendering effects on a new , more powerful hardware and having the ability to design lots of new ships , although honouring the designs laid down in the original show . The mini - series was critically acclaimed on its release . The reviews were excellent across the board , with a lot praise for the actors , direction and acting , and the ratings were very high , setting new records for . It was an easy choice to commission a full first season , especially once confirmed he would drop Carnivale   ( which was being torn apart by corporate politics and would be cancelled after its second season )   to move over as full - time showrunner . When the season proper debuted a year later , with    ( the episode that won the show ) , it was even better . Of course , the show could not quite sustain that early acclaim and its ending would become one of the most divisive in television history , but that \\'s another story . Battlestar did for space - set science fiction what did for epic fantasy , making it grittier , more real and more resonant with a wider audience previously dismissive of the art form . It \\'s a shame we have n\\'t seen more space opera shows come along in its wake , but finally , with shows like , it seems that promise has come good . remains , despite its debatable quality later on , one of the strongest shows ever made , and essential viewing for any fan of the genre .

An illithid spaceship crashes on the banks of , far to the east of the great city of . survivors stumble forth , former prisoners of the illithids , the much - feared mind - flayers . These individuals have been infected with mind - flayer tadpoles , which will slowly burrow into their brains and turn them into new illithids . But something is holding the tadpoles at bay . The companions learn that they may be able to escape their doom , if they can work out their differences , join forces and defeat the greatest threat to and to appear in generations . \\'s now officially is a massive , sprawling , roleplaying game set on world of , better known as the Forgotten Realms . It is the sequel to and \\'s Gate II : Shadows of Amn , of the greatest roleplaying games   ( and in fact video games full stop )   of all time , but also notes that since it \\'s almost a quarter of a century since the last game in the series game out , it requires previous knowledge of the series to enjoy . It arrives at a perfect moment , with the popularity of and tabletop roleplaying games at an all - time high , and goodwill for developers still riding high from their previous games in the Divinity : Original series . It would be churlish to say anything other than \\'s Gate III is an overwhelmingly impressive game . It \\'s enormous , with a playthrough of the main story and most side - quests taking around   hours , but an exhausting playthrough to find every bit of loot , gold and lore taking easily again as long . The game can be played solo or as a co - op online game . You can create a new character from scratch , play as of the existing \" origin characters \"   ( who otherwise become your major party - members ) , or play \" character , who has a murderous drive which ties more directly into the previous games in the series . Creating a new character , you can play as of numerous species , classes and sub - classes , with a wide array of feats , abilities and combat moves to develop and employ . There \\'s a lot of game here , but the game is forgiving enough that you can muddle through even with \" suboptimal \" builds , and it does a good job of teaching you what you need to do as it goes along . I mean , she \\'s not wrong . \\'s feels bizarrely and positively schizophrenic : the game has AAA+ production values , cutscenes , voice - acting , graphics , visual effects and polish   ( at least for the first half of the game )   to shame the latest or \\'s Creed mainstream title , but it \\'s also deeply geeky . The turn - based combat and the need for tactical positioning , mastery of buffs and debuffs and knowledge of how Concentration - based spell effects work all feel better suited for hardcore indie titles aimed squarely at insiders and grognards . The game \\'s most startling success is bridging these audiences , creating a game with the richness and depth of many of the classic titles but the mainstream accessibility and appeal of the most polished action games . The game is n\\'t truly an open - world title , instead being set across very large map in each of the acts , plus a couple of side - maps related to them . Each map will still take a while to simply explore , and are packed with puzzles , enemies , potential allies , caves , loot and mysteries . Many events pertain to your current situation but others are incidental side - quests . Each act has its own major storyline : Act I focuses on a conflict between a goblin army and a druid grove which is also hosting a large number of tiefling refugees from the nearby city of ; Act II is set in the mist - shrouded lands around , where the are planning a strike to retake the fortress from the evil warlord who controls it ; and Act III takes the party to itself , where dubious shifts in governance mask a foul conspiracy unfolding both above and below ground . It sometimes feels like the game could have been a trilogy made up of ~-hour games which would have still been incredibly rewarding , and getting them all in title for price is an insane act of generosity on \\'s part . For the record , is substantially longer than all Mass Effect games combined . No , it \\'s not that one . The game \\'s narrative is complex , with the struggle to overcome the mind - flayer tadpole munching on your cerebellum tied into the mystery of why it has n\\'t already succeeded . Trying to remove this threat leads you into some very strange places . But you are also of characters in the same boat , and each of your companions - Astarion , Gale , , , and Wyll - has their own immense amount of backstory and baggage to deal with . Astarion is a vampire spawn who yearns for vengeance against his abusive former master . has a ticking magical time bomb inside him and emotional damage from a relationship with the Goddess of Magic . is infused with that grants her strength but is also slowly killing her . is a githyanki with a severe attitude problem who is trying to serve her people the best way she can . is a brittle worshipper of , , but also has a good heart that seems at odd with her calling . Wyll is a warlock tied to a dubious , demonic patron . Each of these characters and stories is well - drawn and enacted , with outstanding voice acting . Many of the game \\'s finest moments come from interactions with and between your companion characters , as you move from dysfunctional - at - best allies to more of a found family . That \\'s not going too far into the other characters you meet along the way , people whom you can turn into powerful allies by helping their cause , such as rescuing the druid from the goblin camp or saving the thieves \\' guild of from being usurped by a rival operation . Many of these storylines are also highly engaging . is tactically satisfying , but - and this is a relief - not quite as puzzle - focused as the games . In those games , incredibly tough battles were really puzzles which could only be unlocked through the use of oils , traps and explosives . \\'s Gate III still has many of those elements , but they are more optional and instead combat is more reliant on the tactics you yourself develop through experimentation . This is much more satisfying and enjoyable . Given the game \\'s immense scale , its epic scope , its strong storytelling , outstanding characterisation and immaculate presentation , this must be a clean sweep , surely ? An immediate - star classic?\"This guy seems trustworthy . \"Not quite . \\'s incredible impression is slowly soured by a number of problems   ( some solved by the large number of patches and hotfixes since the game \\'s launch four months ago , some not ) . None of these are fatal , but combined they do remove some of the sheen from the game . The is that the game \\'s launch was technically problematic . The first half of the game was almost flawless , but the half saw gradually escalating crashes , graphical errors , quest triggers misfiring , occasional random deaths and massively tanking framerates   ( especially when reaching itself , one of the most detailed and densest fantasy cities ever depicted in a video game ) . Many of these were fixed , but some issues remain : wonky physics , occasionally vanishing items which you are trying to pick up and cutscenes abruptly ending as the game ca n\\'t work out what scene to play next   ( cutscenes are dynamic and depend on , sometimes , of choices you have made through the game ) .This leads into a problem in that \\'s bills itself as being fully reactive to your game choices , so if you want to surprise - attack a major antagonist halfway through his evil plan speech and yeet him into a lava pit , you certainly can try . The problem is that it \\'s rather easy to trip the game up in this way : in Act I I snuck into the goblin fortress from a side - tunnel rather than infiltrating via the camp outside , and in Act II I stumbled across the Gauntlet of Shar before finding . So , twice , I did major parts of the game \\'s storyline in the opposite order to the way the game expects . Twice , the game failed to adequately respond to this , with characters making reference to things I had not done and people I had not yet met , cutscenes not really making sense and major parts of the story being shut off to me without much forewarning or the ability to do anything about it . The game can also be extremely odd in what it tells you to do , or is possible : at the end of Act I you are told you have to proceed either via a mountain pass or the to reach . But , in fact , you can simply do both . In fact , you really should do both , as major storyline events for your companion characters take place in both locations . Following the game \\'s directions literally can simply cut you out of large amounts of content if you are not careful . Another issue is caused by the game \\'s structure . As you pursue your myriad quests , they start to draw to conclusions deep into Act III , and they then climax in rapid succession , which is what you \\'d expect . But this means that the game can wind up putting very tough boss fights - after - another in the latter part of Act III , which ended up being a bit too much and left the actual final battle of the game feeling a bit undercooked in comparison . The game hints at a better structure earlier one , when \\'s story really climaxes in but gives her a meaty epilogue early in Act III . Wyll \\'s story can also be brought to an early conclusion in Act III . Spacing out the companion characters \\' stories more evenly would be a better idea   ( and it may be possible on a replay to approach things somewhat differently ) .Baldur \\'s also can not help but suffer a little in comparison to its earlier forebears ; its music is notably nowhere near as good   ( \\'s soundtrack perks up with the excellent faux - opera accompanying your confrontation with a very powerful enemy near the end of the game , but is mostly generic )   and - utterly bafflingly - its is sometimes clunkier . Identifying weapons and items in your inventory can be fiddlier , and things that can smoothly be done in click in \\'s now take or . has real - time combat that can be effectively made turn - based through the use of options , whilst BG only has turn - based combat , which sometimes kills the game \\'s pacing when facing off against a bunch of dramatically weaker enemies whom you are absolutely going to rinse regardless . \\'s rogue \\'s gallery of enemies also feels a little flat : the most charismatic and intimidating enemy in the game is seen off in and those left behind are tiresome - stringers . None of Jon \\' powerful gravitas or \\'s mad - dog energy here   ( well , very little of it ) . I \\'m also now a little bored of big RPGs in which something weird is happening inside your head and is going to kill you unless you do the main quest   ( for a genre that utterly despises railroading , the video game versions of pen - and - paper RPGs are awfully fond of doing things that would risk a getting ostracised in real life ) .The final criticism is also not so much of a bug but a feature for a lot of people : \\'s Gate III is a lot and I found myself only really able to enjoy the game with my brain switched full on , paying maximum attention and in the zone . This is not a calm or gentle game to chill out to , like , say , . With its immense checklist of things to do and people to see and monsters to kill , occasionally risks feeling more like work than relaxation . Of course , for those who love number - crunching , story - tracking and optimising builds , this will be a huge appeal rather than a possible weakness . \\'s weaknesses are not insignificant , especially cumulatively , but they ultimately can not derail the game \\'s immense achievements : mostly good writing , strong character work , intriguing combat , gorgeous graphics and best - in - class voice acting . \\'s Gate III   ( * * * * )   has rewritten expectations on how complex , challenging and layered a video game can be and still be a huge crossover smash hit , and it may be some considerable time before we see a game that has as much success . The game is now available on PC ,   and , as of today , Xbox Series X and S.Thank you for reading .

Thanks to a plethora of leaks over the years , much of the game \\'s premise and story was already known . The game opens with new protagonist in prison , but apparently about to get out . When released , she reconnects with partner and immediately embarks on / is forced back into a life of crime . The setting this time is ,   ( or a GTA - ised version of ) .

With latest - generation tech , is considerably larger than its previous incarnations and the game expands beyond the city limits to take in offshore islands   ( including its own version of )   and surrounding countryside . As expected , the game \\'s satirical streak sees it tackling phenomena like \" \" and alligators wandering into civilised areas and wreaking havoc . The game will also feature street races , speedboats , shoot - outs , robberies and , apparently , an in - game version of . Other details remain to be confirmed , such as if both and are playable or just . is already notable as the female protagonist of a mainline , single - player game since the original , although characters in the original were tiny blobs in the centre of the screen and had no discernible personality , so that \\'s not saying much . Also , the game looks amazing . The RAGE Engine - Rockstar \\'s inhouse engine they have been using since   - has been upgraded yet again and Grand Theft Auto VI \\'s in - engine graphics look better than most of their competitor \\'s pre - rendered cutscenes . Given that their previous game    (   )   is still one of the best - looking games in existence , and even Grand Theft Auto V   (   )   looks incredible after its latest update , GTAVI being a huge improvement over them is quite an achievement . The character animation in particular is phenomenal . are keeping a lot of other details to their chest . There \\'s no indication of how the new game will integrate the uber - lucrative , which has generated literally billions of dollars of profit for and publisher since , and a lot of details on the story , characters and factions remain unknown . may reveal more information tomorrow   ( when the trailer was originally supposed to drop ) .The trailer confirms that the game is coming out in    ( possibly spring , given Take \\'s previous marketing spend projections ) .

The Fallout franchise was created by in , as a spiritual successor to an earlier game called   (   ) . The game in the series , released in , was developed by \\'s internal development studio . This studio was renamed and created Fallout    (   )   and   (   ) . Fallout :   (   )   was a much - maligned , console - only release rushed out ahead of the company going bust .

The   ( ) .The Fallout TV series launches on   April   on Prime . Doctor Who has turned sixty years old . The \\'s longest - running drama series aired for the time on   November . Sixty years , forty seasons , exactly   stories ,   episodes , Doctors and    ( ish )   companions later , the show is still going strong , with a trio of anniversary specials due to start airing on Saturday , seeing return to the role of the Doctor . Doctor Who was created by a team at the , consisting of , , , , , , , and , who became the show \\'s executive producer and effective showrunner . The show was designed to fill a Saturday evening gap that had opened between the sports and a music show , with the reasoning they needed a show that could hold the attention of sports fans and ease younger viewers into the pop show . After incoming Head of expressed a wish to develop a science fiction idea , the realised it could draw upon a pre - existing stockpile of sets , props and costumes developed for various historical shows over the years , to be used in a time travel series . The production team realised they could also alternate historical and educational stories with science fiction \" fun \" episodes . Although the development team came up with various aspects of the show , is usually credited as the show \\'s creator for coming up with the name , the premise and the idea of a time - travelling machine larger inside than out . and developed the show \\'s distinct music , whilst and created the show \\'s distinctive title sequence , echoes of which can be found in more modern versions . The original cast . From left to right :   ( ) , the Doctor   ( ) ,   ( )   and   ( Carole ) .For the cast , veteran film actor was cast as the role of the Doctor , a mysterious alien from another world in possession of a   ( Time And Relative Dimensions In Space ) , a machine capable of travelling anywhere and anywhen . He was accompanied on his travels his granddaughter   ( Carole ) . In the very episode , , \\'s schoolteachers   ( )   and   ( ) , become mystified by \\'s incredible brilliance in certain areas but shocking ignorance at others , and decide to travel to her address to talk to her grandfather . However , the address is for a junkyard . They find the disguised as a police telephone box , but soon stumble inside and are stunned at its far larger interior dimensions . The Doctor , panicking at the unexpected discovery , launches the but loses control of its navigation systems , which are apparently malfunctioning . Over the course of many adventures , the Doctor attempts to return and to their home time safely . On their travels , they journey to ancient and the court of , are shrunk to the size of insects and encounter their most persistent foe , . The show \\'s gruelling production schedule   ( producing over   episodes a year back in those days )   took a toll on both cast and crew . Within just three years , the last person left standing from the show \\'s launch was , and he was suffering from increasing ill health . When he decided to quit the show early in its fourth season , it was assumed that would be it : you ca n\\'t have a show called Doctor Who without the Doctor , can you?Patrick Troughton as the Doctor   ( - ) .However , the production team hit on the idea that , since the Doctor was an alien , he could perhaps \" die \" but then be reborn in a new , younger body . was consulted on the idea and he gave it his approval , even suggesting his own replacement : . was duly cast and the Doctor changed his appearance for the time at the end of the classic serial , which was also notable for introducing the . The reign of the Doctor was more consistent - he was joined by Highlander   ( )   for almost its entire length as his companion - but saw some changes in the format . The historical stories , which had never been hugely popular , were quietly dropped . The Doctor would still continue to visit historical periods but now would encounter science fiction threats there . There was a renewed focus on monsters , and the Doctor \\'s reign saw the introduction of , and , all of whom would return in the modern era of the show . Towards the end of the Doctor \\'s run , he visited in the near future and encountered a military organisation known as UNIT   ( ) , ironically inspired by the various times the Doctor had defeated alien incursions with the help of local military or government forces . decided that three years was the optimal time to remain on Doctor Who without being typecast ; the so - called \" Troughton Rule \" of each Doctor staying for three years or three seasons would be followed by succeeding Doctors , with staying for an even shorter period and for a longer period . With his departure at the end of the sixth season , airing in , the decided to revamp the show by making it in full colour , which came at the cost of reducing the episode count to a more modest   episodes a year . Jon Pertwee as the Doctor   ( - ) .Inspired by faster - moving SF productions like , not to mention the gadgets and action of the movies , there was a shift to more action . To save on costs , the was grounded , with the Doctor , now played by , exiled to by his own race , , for breaking their rules on non - interference . The Doctor joined as its scientific advisor and gained not just new companions but also a whole set of new allies , led by the formidable Brigadier   ( ) . The Doctor also gained a nemesis , in the form of the evil Time Lord known as   ( ) . Their Holmes - and - Moriarty - like banter and bickering became a hallmark of the Doctor \\'s reign . This era also saw the multi - Doctor celebration in   (   ) , where , and \\'s Doctors are united by time travel to face the threat of the insane Time Lord known as . Pertwee stayed in the role for five years   ( - ) , electing to leave after death in a tragic car crash . as the Doctor   ( - ) .For the Doctor   ( - ) , the decided to cast the relatively unknown in the role . \\'s eccentric mannerisms , deep booming voice and idiosyncratic humour soon won him legions of fans , and his run on the show would generate many of the best - regarded Doctor Who stories of all time : The Ark in , of the Daleks , Pyramids of , The Talons of , , and more . Under \\'s reign , the show hits its highest - ever audience figures of , and achieved its breakthrough in , with stories airing on creating a small but devoted following   ( including future Simpsons creator ) .Peter as the Doctor   ( - ) .Baker stayed in the role for seven years , still a record , and may have stayed for longer , but incoming new producer was keen for a revamp , feeling the show needed to be revitalised for the s. For \\'s last season a new , more electronic theme tune and title sequence was developed , younger companions were introduced and \\'s tendency to adlib dialogue and improvise on set was heavily reigned in . quit at the end of the eighteenth season and was replaced by the younger as the Doctor   ( - ) . During \\'s tenure it became clearer that the show \\'s low budget was becoming extremely problematic in keeping the show relevant , and viewers interested , especially in the face of increasingly stiff competition from big - budget , glossy shows . However , generally strong scripts ensured that \\'s reign was remembered fondly . as the Doctor   ( - ) .Davison was succeeded by as the Doctor   ( - ) , with the plan being that \\'s Doctor would be unpredictable and unstable , even dangerous , before evolving into a more civilised version of the Doctor . Unfortunately , this simply made him unlikeable out of the gate . Incoming , new executives disliked the show and tried to kill it , but viewing figures remained reasonable . After an eighteen - month hiatus after \\'s first season , the show was brought back with a drastically cut episode count   ( to just   half - hour episodes )   and a shift to a midweek timeslot opposite \\'s most popular show , , carefully designed to make the show unviable . as the Doctor   ( - ,   ) .Baker was also fired and replaced by as the Doctor   ( - ) , a comedian best known for an act involving putting ferrets in his trousers . Against the odds , played his Doctor as a master - manipulator and cunning instigator of plots , developing a formidable bond with his companion ) , a teenager from a rough estate who thrives when taken on adventures in time and space . \\'s era generated several classic stories and was on a creative and critical high when the decided to \" rest \" show after its th season in .Paul as the Eighth Doctor   (   ) .Doctor Who spent sixteen years in the wilderness , with only a single TV special in   starring as the short - lived Eighth Doctor . The show continued to generate considerable income for the through and , later , DVD sales , toys , models , video games , comic books and a vast range of novels and short story collections   ( including stories by , , and , amongst many others ) . The kept trying to relaunch the show as a big - budget movie , but could not attract significant interest . as the Ninth Doctor   (   ) .Finally , the resurrected Doctor Who in . , of the hottest TV writers in the business and a lifelong Doctor Who fan , picked up the reigns after the success of his dramas as Folk , The Second Coming and . He returned the show to Saturday night primetime and recruited to the play role of the Ninth Doctor , with former pop star playing his companion . The new show shared continuity with the old , but was softly rebooted , with a new premise which saw the Doctor as the last survivor of his race after they were annihilated in against the Daleks . as the Doctor   ( - ) .The show saw impressive viewing figures on its return , with young children particularly swept up in its charm . The show started shifting vast amounts of merchandise , and picked up steam on in the . There was an early hiccup when quit after just one season due to creative differences with of the directors , but he was quickly replaced by as the Doctor   ( - ) . \\'s performance came to be regarded as iconic , on a par with that of for the classic show , and his popularity was impressive . He did three full seasons as the Doctor and a series of specials . During Davies \\' run he also extended the franchise \\'s reach to other shows , with the adult - focused   ( - )   and the kid - friendly   ( - )   both launching on his watch . as the Eleventh Doctor   ( - ) .Tennant \\'s departure coincided with that of , and the immensely popular writer picked to succeed . He brought in as the Eleventh Doctor   ( - ) , who brought a younger energy to proceedings . Under \\'s sure hand , the show experienced arguably the zenith of its appeal and fame , achieving a major , breakthrough success in profile in . The th anniversary special , Day of the Doctor , aired in cinemas worldwide and saw huge viewing figures achieved . as the Twelfth Doctor   ( - ) .The reign of the Twelfth Doctor   ( - ) , played by , was critically acclaimed , particular for the episode Heaven Sent , but saw complaints about convoluted plotting . The show also experienced budget problems during this time , airing increasingly intermittently and dropping its episode count . There was also speculation that had stayed too long   ( eight years , less than in the s ) ; he departed alongside . as the Doctor   ( - ) .Capaldi was succeeded by as the Doctor   ( - ) , the actress to play the role . , who had been writing for the show since era , became showrunner off the back of his hot detective show   ( - ) . The show became more filmic during this period , with most sophisticated effects and expansive location filming in . However , the budget continued to be squeezed , with the show dropping to just episodes per season and extremely long gaps between seasons   ( not helped by the pandemic ) . The show also moved from Saturday to Sunday nights , and was dropped in favour of that attracted far less attention . The show \\'s critical acclaim dropped to its lowest level since its return in , with criticism of the overlarge cast   ( which sometimes left the Doctor with little screen time ) , pacing and a curious decision to retcon the Doctor \\'s origins . Viewing figures also fell significantly during this period . as the Fourteenth Doctor   ( - ) .Despite early discussions about a five - season run and story arc , and decided to leave after three seasons and a series of special episodes ; ironically , their very last episode as also their best , and best - regarded . In a shock move , the was able to recruit to return to the show . had gained international stature after leaving Who in   through a series of prestige dramas , including Years and Years and It \\'s a . Davies used his return to leverage impressive results : Doctor Who would return to Saturday nights , would return , the entire Doctor Who archive would be made available via , the show would move to an independent production company   ( , founded by \\' former friends and coworkers from during his original tenure on the show )   and would co - fund the series and distribute it internationally on its streaming platform . For the show \\'s th Anniversary , would also bring back , albeit playing the distinctive Doctor rather than the return of the . as the Fifteenth Doctor   ( - ? ? ) .It would be confirmed that \\'s return would be limited , with - Rwandan actor cast as the Fifteenth Doctor , to debut in the   Christmas Special . is already filming his season as the Doctor months before his is due to air . The appeal of Doctor Who is fairly obvious : the show can go anywhere in space or time . Despite a gradual accumulation of lore , backstory and story arcs over six decades , the show is mostly focused on standalone stories than anyone can enjoy . The show has always been aimed at family audiences , as once said , to appeal to everyone from . The show features action , but the Doctor is reluctant to kill or use violence , preferring thinking and negotiation . The concept of regeneration , as well as the revolving door of companions , constantly allows the show to refresh itself every few years , with constant media interest in the next actor to take on the role . That Doctor Who is still being made after sixty years is incredible . Hopefully it will go on at least sixty years more . , , . A spate of unexplained murders bring agents and to the remote , sleepy town . They find a town still uneasy over the memories of thirteen years before , when there was another spate of murders and the disappearance and presumed death of infamous author . and \\'s investigations confirm that the supernatural forces that Wake had to deal with have indeed returned , possibly thanks to a mysterious cult . Meanwhile , Wake himself remains trapped in , a dimension beyond our own , where he strives to find a way back to reality . , originally released in   and remastered in , was an interesting but flawed game . It had a great story , characters and premise , but struggled to find the gameplay thread in its morass of noir and horror influences . The game degenerated into being a repetitive action - shooter , Wake throwing flashbang grenades and fending off enemies with shotguns and handguns . This was n\\'t awful , but it was something of a tonal mismatch . also ended on a cliffhanger   ( and , after more DLCs , another cliffhanger )   which people have been left pondering ever since . Thanks to the surprise success of their   supernatural action game , , have had the resources to finally deliver a sequel to . Even more remarkable is how they \\'ve accomplished this : a game with production values delivered on a modest budget   ( reportedly only $ million )   in just three years . Much more remarkable than that is how incredibly good the game is . I \\'m not sure I \\'ve seen such a gulf in quality between game in a series and its direct sequel , even given such a large gap in release dates . , on the surface , resembles its forebear . You \\'re still trudging through the forests of , defending yourself with various guns and a flashlight . You \\'re still fighting off \" Taken , \" effectively zombies , dead humans motivated by the evil Dark Presence . You \\'re still mixing combat , puzzle - solving and narrative beats . Your adventure is still being narrated over - earnestly by himself . But the sequel simply nails every single one of these facets far better than its forebear . The big change is the addition of a new viewpoint character , . Saga stands in for new players , who \\'ve perhaps heard of but have n\\'t played it ahead of this sequel . \\'s story takes her to the town of and the nearby , both key locations from the original game , as well as further afield to new areas , such as the town of and a nearby amusement park   ( ! )   and lighthouse . \\'s story is anchored in the \" real world \" and it \\'s interesting to see her gradually bump into characters and locations that tie in with \\'s story from the original game . Saga has major assets : her friend and partner , who shares the same name as \\'s signature detective hero ; and her \" , \" a mental technique which allows her to analyse clues and keep abreast of the game \\'s sprawling narrative . At almost any point in the game , can slip into her and digest her latest discoveries . The big change is in structure . was a very linear game where Wake travelled from the start of level to the next , occasionally facing larger arena areas which were more open   ( usually for combat or even a boss fight ) . Famously , the game was developed as an open - world title but that was changed late in the day to improve pacing . The sequel is n\\'t a full open - world game but instead is more similar to a , being divided into several areas , with each being explorable at will but having various areas sealed off by environmental elements or by literal gates . As the game progresses you gain access to tools to allow you to access these areas later on . There \\'s also a change here in terms of collectibles . had thermoses lying around which you could collect and then do absolutely nothing with . has types of collectible : lunchboxes tying in with \\'s books ; mysterious nursery rhymes attached to puzzles ; and sealed containers belonging to the mysterious . These collectibles are each attached to their own storyline chain and unlock additional weapons , abilities and equipment for . They are not essential , but they make her journey easier , and fill in additional backstory and worldbuilding details . Tracking down these things also allows you to explore more of each map , sometimes finding other equipment caches along the way . Another big change is combat . It \\'s now been under - emphasised compared to the game . is somewhat rarer , more lethal and more of a resource - managing challenge , more in line with the recent remakes . This is better than the original , where Wake was only somewhat less of a competent death - dealing gunsmith than , with much more tension . Unfortunately , this makes the decision to base key setpiece moment near the game \\'s conclusion around waves of combat fairly inexplicable , resulting in the game \\'s steepest difficulty spike . All of this applies to . It \\'s not a major spoiler to say at a key moment in the game , we rejoin in the Dark Place and have to help him try to escape . in this game resembles a twisted , shadowy version of , complete with subways , theatres , a hotel and \\'s apartment . Traversing is more complex than the real world . does n\\'t have \\'s , but he does have his Writer \\'s Room . At any point can switch to this room and use it to analyse the plot , like , but unlike her he can also change the plot . In a mechanic that recalls the superb   mission \" , \" can flash back to earlier points in the story and thus in time , when an area may look completely different . can take advantage of this to get past sealed - off areas or discover fresh clues about what \\'s going on and how he can escape . You can soon choose to switch between the characters at will , choosing whether to mainline all of \\'s story and then all of \\'s , or maybe alternate at the end of every chapter . Despite being trapped in different universes , and develop a link that allows them to work together to help defeat the Dark Presence . This works all rather splendidly . and \\'s stories have different feels and tones , so the ability to switch between them whenever \\'s over - earnest monologues or \\'s family concerns get a bit too much is appreciated . is also surprisingly funny . The game had some laughs , but the sequel takes things up a notch with comedic - budget adverts from a pair of brothers and , as is now well - known , a full - blown musical number that makes up an entire chapter of the game . Quite a few characters are also now pretty over the whole \" shocked by supernatural stuff \" thing and whose only reaction to some fresh eruption of inexplicable weirdness is a world - weary sigh . This is especially noticeable when characters from show up and are utterly unphased by the Dark Presence doing its thing ; they \\'ve seen this stuff before in . Ah yes , . As is well - know now , and its sequel both take place in the same universe as , which the game is quite upfront about   ( you \\'ll meet an FBC agent probably around an hour into the game , maybe less ) . Some characters show up , and gets to read a bunch of reports from the FBC on the Cauldron Lake phenomenon . could have maybe been a bit more low - key on this , as a few times I felt almost penalised for not having finished I started it when it came out , but got sidetracked by other games ) , but it \\'s not too bad . More amusing are the very deep cuts to \\'s other games , and the titles ; does n\\'t own those any more , so they have to rename characters   ( becomes ; becomes the fictional )   but the general ideas come across well . Players less well - versed in lore might miss out on the meaning of some , but the game mostly tells you what you need to know within the game itself . also looks utterly stupendous , easily the best - looking video game in the world right now . Character animations are impressive   ( though some characters - like - seem a lot stiffer than others ) , but it \\'s the lighting effects and environmental graphics in the forests or on the not - subway which are completely mindblowing . This does come at the cost of hefty systems requirements on PC , with even my new   graphics card occasionally chugging unless was switched on . Consoles are broadly fine , but it \\'s going to be a good few years before most PC players will be able to experience this game at maximum settings .   ( * * * * )   comes very close to being an outright masterpiece . It is very well - paced , it has a ton of content - Wake and \\'s stories are each individually as long as in its entirety , meaning this game is twice the size and length of its forebear - the horror elements are far more effective , the atmosphere is superb and the writing is easily \\'s best to date . There are very nice links to all of \\'s previous games   ( bar possibly ) , but playing those titles is not strictly necessary to enjoy this game   ( the references do push the limit on that , though ) , and for a horror game , it has a brilliant sense of humour . It has some fantastic gameplay mechanics and several setpiece events which are clear challengers for the best gaming moments of the year   ( especially the horrific murder investigation in the hotel , the ludicrous rock opera and a -minute arthouse film completely contained within the game ) . It is a fantastic - looking game , and the soundtrack is outrageously good . It has earned its nominations , being a worth competitor to the likes of and Cyberpunk : Phantom Liberty . Complaints are few . The game is let down a little by its combat , especially the decision to base an entire key moment around an absolute ton of combat despite it not being the game \\'s forte . The story and lore is pretty dense at times , requiring you to pay close attention or miss out on key plot points . The game \\'s ending is great , with some excellent twists , but also somewhat ambiguous , left afloat for the forthcoming episodes which will continue the storyline . The game \\'s steep system requirements and Epic - exclusive status   ( to be fair , also paid for the game \\'s development and are its publishers , so the game would n\\'t even exist without them )   will also put off many PC gamers . Overall these complaints are slight . is \\'s best game to date , a rich horror narrative with compelling gameplay which improves over its predecessor on every single front . is available now on PC ,   and Xbox Series X / S.Thank you for reading . To help me provide better content , please consider contributing to my page and other funding methods . have unveiled a brief teaser for the upcoming game in the Mass Effect franchise . As part of N Day - an annual celebration of the franchise derived from the N special forces group in the video games - released a series of text and video bursts teasing a new clip . Once fans had done some detective work , the full clip was posted as above . The accompanying text   ( in the original files )   suggests that the next game in the series takes place in or after the year , the year that Mass Effect : Andromeda took place in , and a distress call from has been detected . The text also suggests that , the - led human faction in the Mass Effect universe , is still extant . The original Mass Effect trilogy concluded in the year , for reference . and parent company confirmed some years ago that a new Mass Effect game was in development . However , it is still likely some years off ; the company is currently working hard to get Dragon Age : finished for its likely   launch and will only turn its full firepower towards Mass Effect    ( or , more likely , )   after that game comes out . The Mass Effect franchise was launched in   with the titular original game ; it was followed by Mass Effect    (   )   and Mass Effect    (   ) . The games are notable for combining into one very large mega - game where players can guide their characters through almost   hours of an epic space opera war story , in which humanity and the other races of the Milky Way are plunged into war against an ancient alien threat , the . In   released Mass Effect : Andromeda , a spin - off story set more than six centuries later in the Andromeda Galaxy . However , the game garnered a lukewarm reaction from fans and middling sales . decided not to proceed with a direct sequel , despite the game setting up . In   they released Mass Effect : , a packaging of all original games into title with some upgrades to the graphics and controls . It sounds like the new game will take place in the Milky Way again and will have to decide which of Mass \\'s endings is canon . However , by taking place after , it may also be able to resolve some of the unresolved story threads from that game . Although teasing a new Mass Effect game is welcome , fans have also taken advantage of N Day to criticise the lay - offs of numerous developers from the company in the last few weeks , including some of the last original team - members from the \\'s Gate franchise   ( an interesting look after \\'s Gate III launched back in August from and was a massive critical and commercial success of the kind that has not enjoyed in over fifteen years ) , as well as staff after they voted to unionise   ( although have pointed out that was a decision by their contracted company rather than themselves ) .It \\'s fair to say that an enormous amount is riding on the success of both Dragon Age : and Next : have not had a really big hit since the release of Dragon Age : Inquisition nine years ago , and the company has since been haemorrhaging fans , critical acclaim and its creative firepower . is a successful novelist suffering from writer \\'s block . He and his wife , , take a holiday to , , and rent a cabin on an island in the middle of a volcanic lake . When surprises with a typewriter , hoping he \\'ll feel inspired to start writing again , becomes angry and storms out . He hears his wife screaming , only to find the cabin and the island have disappeared . Apparently the island was destroyed in a volcanic eruption in . Wake discovers he has somehow lost a week , and keeps finding pages from a new novel he \\'s been writing called in which he himself is the protagonist . As shadowy creatures attack him and TV shows seem to reflect his state of mind , Wake must discover whether he has gone insane and attempt to track down his missing wife . was originally released in   by developers . At the time they were best - known for their series of shooters with interesting time - slowing capabilities . Since release they have worked on and , and more recently . was released in   as a way of improving the original game and also releasing it on consoles   ( the original was only available on   and , after a significant delay , PC ) , and getting people into the story ahead of the release of the sequel . is a surprisingly restrained revision of the original game . The main focus is on the graphics , with revised and updated textures , a new and more impressive lighting system and it now being possible to boost the resolution up to This is all splendid and results in very impressive visuals , although unfortunately the process has not been optimised well ; the game occasionally chugged even with an   under the hood . More annoying were visual glitches and problems , which could be briefly fixed with a reload but soon returned . Oddly , these problems are mostly focused in the and episodes of the game and were not present before or after . However , the problem is widespread   ( going by the game \\'s forums and subreddit )   and has not been fixed after two years , which is disconcerting . Otherwise the game runs exactly the same as it did back in , complete with somewhat clunky movement and occasionally iffy dodging mechanics . This is an action thriller where you control the titular , a novelist suffering from writers \\' block after killing off his most iconic character . He takes a holiday with his wife , but gets angry when he realises that she has tricked him into a retreat to focus on his writing , with a hospital nearby specialising in the mental health problems of artists . When storms out , his wife abruptly vanishes . loses a week of his life , waking up to experience strange visions . However , when he receives at telephone call from a man claiming to have his wife hostage , it appears that the situation is understandable , if frightening . But then encounters , \" possessed individuals clad in shadows who seem to be obsessed with destroying him , and it becomes clear something much more supernatural is at work . The game is divided into daytime sequences where wanders around and interacts with characters , maybe solves the odd puzzle , and uncovers more about the story , and night sequences where has to achieve some objective whilst fighting off the Taken . The Taken have to be illuminated with a flashlight and , once their \" darkness \" has been burned off , can be dispatched with conventional weapons . As the game unfolds across its relatively well - paced - hours or so , both the types and tactics of Taken evolve , as does \\'s arsenal and his skills for dealing with them in combat . The sheer volume of combat remains quite surprising : those who \\'ve heard that is the closest thing to in videogame form may be taken aback by the amount of time Wake spends blowing people away with shotguns .   The game also feels like it sometimes does n\\'t like doing this   ( combat within a section of the game can get quite repetitive ) , but has to fall back on shooting things as the default game style rather than run the risk of the dialogue and cutscenes putting off too many people . The game does have missed opportunities though : as is well - known , the game was originally an open world game , which can still be discerned in some areas   ( areas from mission are clearly visible bordering another later on , with some artificial barrier preventing you from free - travelling over there )   but was taken out due to pacing issues . The game allows you to drive vehicles in some limited sequences , and there \\'s some interesting puzzles to solve , which could have been expanded on to make for more interesting and varied gameplay outside of combat . It \\'s notable that the bonus DLC episodes   ( included here , weirdly , as optional extras buried in the level select screen , but definitely do n\\'t miss them )   have better pacing , puzzle - solving , traversal mechanics and combat than the main game itself , suggesting that only figured out how to get the best out of the game quite late in the day . The story is interesting and well - thought out , with writer trademark humour , enjoyably overwrought   ( and sometimes deliberately purple )   prose and an internal logic that hangs together even as things get quite surreal and out there . Dividing the game into TV - like episodes   ( complete with a recap and their own credit sequence and theme song ) , each about an hour and a half to two hours long , is also a masterstroke of pacing , ensuring the game \\'s combat and story beats do n\\'t get too repetitive and it never feels like you \\'re too far from a natural break point in the flow of events . The game also does do a good job of changing things up whenever it feels like you \\'re maybe spending a bit too much time in the woods aiming flashlights at trees , with some mid and late - game setpieces being genuinely impressive . Again , some of the best stuff is actually in the DLC episodes . In the thirteen years since release , gaming has moved on a fair bit and ca n\\'t help but feel clunky , with sometimes - sluggish controls and occasionally iffy animations , with an overreliance on combat . This remaster also feels like it may not be entirely necessary , given that the gameplay has not been overhauled to the same standards as the graphics . But there \\'s a very solid story at work here , the mixture of CG and live - action cut scenes is a nice foreshadowing of \\'s subsequent work , and the game is well - paced and does n\\'t outstay its welcome . The game \\'s biggest weakness it is technical issues which make the middle or so of the game a bit of a game of as you wait for it to work out if it \\'s going to crash or not . This should really have been fixed years ago . Also , and a fairly big annoyance on PC , is that it \\'s only available on the Epic Game Store . As the PC version is actually published by , there \\'s little likelihood of it appearing on Steam in the future . Another minor complaint : the stand - alone expansion is not included in this package . is a bit of a weird game   ( being almost entirely combat - focused )   and tonally did n\\'t entirely gel with the original game , so I can understand why decided to ignore it this time around , but completionists may feel short - changed at its absence .   ( * * * )   is an enjoyably solid game , especially at the very reasonable price it can be had for these days . It has n\\'t aged entirely well and some might be surprised at its overreliance on combat , which is a little at odds with its supernatural mystery genre . It \\'s also very much to considerably bigger , more ambitious Lord of the , and like that is n\\'t strictly necessary to understand the sequel , but it certainly helps . The game is available now on PC   ( via ) , and . Thank you for reading . To help me provide better content , please consider contributing to my page and other funding methods . The has confirmed that the very Doctor Who story to feature the Daleks is to get a makeover and revamp for the imminent th Anniversary of the franchise . Originally airing across episodes in late   and early , The Daleks was the story to feature the titular tinpot menace , and the - ever Doctor Who serial . The serial , , which introduced the Doctor , the and the - ever companions   ( , and ) , had aired to fairly poor ratings , suggesting the new show would be cancelled before it ever really got off the ground . However , The Daleks was a smash - hit , almost tripling ratings over the course of its run and encouraging of schoolchildren to run around their playgrounds yelling \" Exterminate!\"For the th anniversary , the serial has been re - edited from its original near three - hour runtime down to a breezier   minutes . has contributed a re - edited musical score , building on the work of original composer . Most impressively , the -minute cut has been completely colourised , with more than a year \\'s work going into the process   ( the original six seasons of Doctor Who were recorded in black - and - white ) .The original version of the serial will remain available on . In the serial , the Doctor   ( ) , his granddaughter   ( Carole )   and their reluctant new companions   ( )   and   ( )   arrive on the planet , where an energy drain prevents the from leaving . Outside they find a forest that has been completely petrified and evidence of a massive nuclear war in the recent past . They also discover an eerily empty , technologically - advanced city . Of course , the city is not as abandoned as appears , and the Doctor is soon introduced to his most infamous foes . The Daleks was originally written by and directed by   ( episodes - , - )   and   ( , - ) . The executive producer - today \\'s equivalent of a showrunner - was , and the script editor was . The serial aired from   December   to   February . The Daleks were designed by . In   the serial was adapted as the Doctor Who feature film , Dr. Who and the Daleks , starring as the Doctor .

An additional special episode will air during the festive season , possibly on Christmas Day , featuring the full adventure for as the Fifteenth Doctor . Series   of the show   ( since its return in ; the show \\'s th season overall since   )   will start airing in early . Next year \\'s Christmas special is already in the bag and production is currently underway on , as part of returning showrunner plan to return the show to airing annually without any multi - year breaks . The new behind - the - scenes companion show , Doctor Who : Unleashed will launch at the same time , with each episode becoming available on , and after each new episode airs . The th Anniversary itself falls on   November . have confirmed that their TV version of the video game series will debut on on   April .The Fallout TV series will be set in , some time after a nuclear war that devastates in the year . It will not be based on any pre - existing video game , but will instead feature a new story beginning in , where an inhabitant of the finds themselves having to venture out into the post - apocalyptic world beyond . The TV show stars   ( , ) ,   ( , The Hateful Eight ) ,   ( Dune , ) ,   ( ) ,   ( ) ,   ( Homeland ) ,   ( Severance ) ,   ( Ant - Man ) ,   ( Dead Ringers ) ,   ( Law & Order : ) ,   ( ) ,   ( Deadpool ) ,   ( The Boys ) ,   ( , ) ,   ( Oz , )   and   ( Heightened ) .The show was created by and   ( , Westworld )   and will be showrun by and   ( ) .The Fallout video game franchise began in   with the titular video game , created by and for Interplay Studios . Interplay subsequently released Fallout    (   ) , Fallout : Tactics   (   )   and Fallout :   (   )   before the company collapsed . was subsequently bought by , who then made and released Fallout    (   ) ,   (   ) , Fallout    (   )   and Fallout    (   ) . They also licensed the rights to of the successor company to Interplay - to make Fallout :   (   ) . The video games have also spun off a successful wargame , , and a tabletop roleplaying game , both from , and board games from . have confirmed that their epic space game , the single - player component of their franchise , is now feature - complete and entering the polishing and testing phase ahead of release . The release is not imminent - the similar polishing phase on space took two years by itself - but at last light can be seen at the end of the tunnel . Back in , Wing Commander and developer decided to make the space game to end all space games : a vast , multiplayer game featuring piloting , space combat , - person movement and combat , trading and exploration . The game , , entered full - time development in   and by   had raised a modest $ million via . also allowed direct funding via its own website , which quickly dwarfed the funding from . The original plan had been to have a Wing Commander - esque single player campaign included within the overall title , but this was spun off into its own game , , quite early on . As funding for   increased , so the scope for both games increased dramatically . Fully - voiced and mocapped sequences starring major actors were added , followed by dynamic physics for everything from planetary orbits to the sheets in your pilot \\'s bedroom . Cosmetic upgrades and even entire ships were sold at premium prices via website , leading to accusations of being a scam . However , also released fully - playable game modules and steadily expanded these over time , showing there was a game being developed   ( albeit over an almost - unprecedentedly long period ) .As of today ,   have been in full - time development for well over twelve years , raising over $ million in funding from backers and investors , making this comfortably the most expensive video game project of all time and the most successful crowdfunding project of all time . By some metrics it might be the most expensive entertainment product ever , with twice the budget of the most expensive movie and the previous most expensive - ever video games . Several rivals and sort - of rivals to were announced after it but launched far earlier : Elite : Dangerous in , No Man \\'s Sky in   and in .The trailer shows your player - created character   ( gender and appearance fully customisable , as you \\'d expect from a modern game )   chewing the fat with , boarding a derelict space station alongside , watching give a rousing speech and being guided through a mission by your man - in - the - van   ( resuming his collaboration with from multiple Wing Commander games and ) . The game features space combat and dogfighting , exploration of vast alien structures , ground combat , stealth , boat - driving and physics puzzles . The game engine boasts of the ability to seamlessly transition from walking around on your carrier to flying your fighter to flying over the surface of a planet , landing , jumping out , fighting and taking over vehicles   ( contrasts with \\'s endless array of loading screens have been made ) .Given the gigantic scope of the game , bug - fixing , tech optimisation and will likely take a good year or   ( possibly more ) , but it looks like   is finally moving towards completion . How long it will take for Star Citizen itself to follow remains to be seen . is pursuing his dream : of one day finding the One Piece , the mightiest treasure in all the world , and declaring himself . There is a slight problem with this goal : he has no ship , no crew , no reputation and very limited pirating skills . What he does have is the ability to stretch his body , thanks to the magical effects of he ill - advisedly ate as a boy . When meets skilled thief and navigator , and the pirate - hunter , who wants to become the greatest swordsman in history , he is finally able to set about achieving his ambition . Piece is a live action adaptation of the biggest - selling manga of all time . original comic series has shifted copies , meaning it is bearing down on the series \\' position as the biggest - selling fantasy work of all time with a vengeance . The comic has accumulated over a issues in its quarter - century of publication and is still not finished , although Oda has confirmed that it has entered its final story arc . This TV show has to overcome several significant problems : the lack of good manga / anime - to - live action adaptations ; the enormous amount of material to adapt ; and the source material \\'s incredibly unique tone , which makes adapting it an almost ludicrous prospect . Fortunately , the original creator is on board to help out . Oda acted as a consultant and producer on the show , approved   ( and even revised )   scripts , and approved casting . The same studio that made the Cowboy Bebop adaptation   ( which I broadly enjoyed , but had some issues with )   was behind this , but listening to fan criticisms about divergences from the source material , they decided to both be more faithful to that material and have the original creator more closely involved . The result , rather easily , is the best manga - to - live action show we \\'ve seen yet . The show matches the original \\'s zany energy and is able to deliver its tricky tonal shifts from comedy to action to something darker to the screen successfully . has the tough job of playing but nails the role , portraying \\'s optimism and ambition but also his sense of friendship and his rare bursts of anger when confronted by evil and oppression . Emily \\'s is an excellent co - lead , an unreliable ally with her own agenda   ( driven by past trauma )   but who does appreciate her friends and allies . Rounding out the central trio is as . This is probably the most \" stock anime \" character in the show , the young swordsman with a taciturn attitude , a love of alcohol and the ambition to become the greatest warrior in the world , but also a strong sense of honour and fair play which is sometimes out of keeping with his cynicism . \\'s deadpan live delivery and impressive action skills make him one of the most impressive members of the cast . other key members of \\'s crew also join the proceedings mid - season , with playing , and playing . Both are solid , although is perhaps a little let down by the writing   ( it \\'s hard to sympathise with a grown - ass man constantly crying wolf about pirate attacks only to be let down by his friends when a real one takes place )   and by joining the fray relatively late in the day . Hopefully both are developed better in .The show also develops an extensive cast of additional allies , enemies and characters - of - uncertain allegiance . The season may be episodes long , but they cover the same ground as the episodes of the anime , and the issues of the manga . That means a fair bit of compression , but it also keeps the story moving at quite a crack , with little filler or downtime . Each episode   ( or - episode sub - arc )   builds on the last whilst also telling its own story , creating a somewhat old - fashioned mix of serialised subplots and stand - alone main plots . Each episode therefore needs to be structured more like a feature film than a TV episode , introducing and resolving storylines , introducing new characters and villains , establishing credible motivations and make it all entertaining . It \\'s certainly helped by the outrageous budget : a lot of recent genre TV has been blighted by horrible , plastic - looking and rushed effects work . There \\'s a couple of moments in Piece that could be tightened up   ( including a very awkward CGI kick for in the season finale , although it \\'s also quite funny )   but overall the effects work is incredibly good , adding to the feeling of each episode being its own miniature epic of a storyline . There are downsides to the series . The enormous number of names , magical concepts , locations and ideas being fired at the viewer can be hard to keep up with , but you do n\\'t necessarily want to tap any of the wikis or guides to the franchise for fear of spoilers . The geography could be perhaps a bit better depicted   ( the show has a fabulous map in its end credits , but sadly this does not appear to be available separately ) . portrayal of is perhaps a tad too intense given the tone of the rest of the show . Several important characters very abruptly disappear from the story   ( like the axe - hand guy ) , although with our heroes travelling hundreds of miles from location to location by ship , that at least is realistic . Maybe each episode is so jammed full that it \\'s not actually the best show for bingeing : I had to take breaks between episodes . Piece is a veritable banquet of story : richly enjoyable , but it can also be filling .. Most of these are less than quibbles . The first season of One Piece   ( * * * * )   is energetic , well - acted , impressively - written and flips between comedy , drama and pathos with assurance . The production values are outrageous , and the actors all seem to get the assignment , no matter how daft their costumes or dubious their hairstyles . I suspect the anime and manga are about to get a whole ton of new fans as well , and hopefully can find a way of delivering the already - confirmed second season in a reasonable timeframe . Piece is available to watch globally on right now . Thank you for reading . To help me provide better content , please consider contributing to my page and other funding methods . More than thirty years ago , refugees on reached a deal with and that they would work undercover for the organisation , using their amazing shapeshifting skills , in return for \\'s help in locating a new homeworld for them . Unfortunately , some of the Skrulls are unhappy with the length of time it has taken Fury to deliver on his promise , and instigate a new plan : to take as their new home . Fury and his old friend join forces to defeat the rebels \\' plan , but find fighting an army of shapeshifters is incredibly hard , even with shapeshifters of their own to help . Secret Invasion is , in almost all respects , a television series . It is episodes long , and features sequential events that build to tell a story . If this sounds like a very dull and overly pedantic description , that \\'s because Secret Invasion is possibly the ultimate example of Extruded Franchise Product : something that exists to make money and to keep fans ticking over until in the franchise appears to take their money . It does not dare to innovate , say or do anything interesting . It simply exists , without much in the way of passion or engagement . Exactly how you make this premise the most boring entry of Universe to date is a matter for conjecture . You have an outrageously good cast , including , , , , ,   ( in a much smaller - than - expected role ) , and a bunch of promising newcomers . The most notable of these is who shows some fire as main antagonist but is let down by the indifferent writing . Everyone else phones their performances in , apart from who is having more fun than everybody else on the show combined , and , who gets a few great scenes as the sarcastic - disguised - as - Rhodey . Perhaps a sign that should get more villainous roles in the future . The show also has a remarkable air of topicality : the rebel plan is to trigger a third world war by undertaking attacks on and soil and getting them to blame one another . In decidedly bonkers moment , we learn that forces are moving into   ( the show was written and partially filmed before the February   invasion , but completed shooting and post - production afterwards ) . There is also a lot of commentary on how to handle refugees and deal with displaced populations . However , any potential for the show to speak to our current moment is lost by the writing resolutely steering away from such things , presumably because it just wants to be escapist entertainment   ( which is a bit hard when the show leans so hard into modern - feeling issues ) .Still , you could still have a good show if anybody felt like they were actually invested in this idea . Much has been made of the opening title sequence , which was partially generated by artificial intelligence . I \\'m surprised there has n\\'t been more attention paid to if the script was written by artificial intelligence as well . It feels like a greatest hits of and thriller tropes thrown into a blender and the results fired at a wall to see what sticks , but with almost no passion or excitement about the ideas in play . The show \\'s biggest mistake is wasting . is a fantastic , charismatic performer , but here he is depicted as filled with self - doubt . On level , it \\'s great that the show allows to be human and flawed , and weighed down in the latter part of his life by everything he \\'s done . But that would require an outstanding pedigree of writing and direction to pull off , which is not the case here . instead often comes across as bored , with flat line deliveries . He sometimes sparks into life , and the show is at its best when he and are exchanging quips or he and are engaged in dramatic face - offs . But these moments are relatively few and far between . Secret Invasion   ( * * )   should be a home run : of the most popular performers in the in a   ( relatively )   grounded , near - future thriller , packed with interesting and - if inadvertently - topical ideas . Instead it feels tired , bored and out of gas . There are flashes of quality , a few good performances , a couple of solid character scenes , some nice action beats , but these are separated by yawning voids of mediocrity . Easily the weakest show to date and a strong claimant to being the weakest instalment of the as a whole . Thank you for reading .

The have confirmed that the entire run of iconic science fiction series Doctor Who will be available on the streaming service from the start of November .

Unfortunately , it will not be the complete run of the show :   episodes from the first six seasons   ( - )   remain missing following the \\'s junking policy of old episodes in the s. Some of these missing episodes have been reconstructed for DVD and with still photographs and audio recordings   ( the audio for all the episodes has survived ) , or the use of animation and the original audio tracks . It \\'s unclear if these reconstructions will be made available as well . It \\'s also unclear if the episodes will include those that have been upscaled for release on in the last few years , or just the standard versions . The has confirmed that it will be adding subtitles , audio description and sign language to every single episode for the time . As well as both eras of Doctor Who , spin - off shows , The and Class will also be available , along the   TV movie   ( starring as the Eighth Doctor ) , the various mini - episodes produced over the years , and every episode of behind - the - scenes show Doctor Who Confidential .

CD will collaborate with production company to create a live - action project set in the world of their video game , Cyberpunk . It is unclear if this is a direct adaptation of the game or an adjacent project in the same world , similar to   anime spin - off series , which was a hit for . worked on , Mr. , The Revenant and Spotlight , and are known for serious , intense genre works , which would be a good fit for the Cyberpunk world . Cyberpunk   is based on the Cyberpunk role - playing game franchise created by in the late s   ( which had its heyday with the Cyberpunk   product line , released through the s ) . The video game , released in late , sees the player taking on the role of V , a scrappy mercenary in , , who inadvertently ends up with a chip which could bring down entire global powers . To stop the chip \\'s destruction , they install it into their cyberware , resulting in them being joined in their adventures by the apparent cyber - ghost of legendary rebel and rock star   ( ) . The chip allows them to use more cyberware and powerful weapons than anybody else , but also will inevitably kill them , forcing them to make a hard choice on how to save , or themselves . Despite a buggy and controversial launch , the game has undergone a redemption arc thanks to a steady bug - fixing schedule . The game has sold   copies and recently launched its well - received expansion   ( starring as secret agent ) , which has sold   copies in its first two weeks on sale . Video game adaptations used to be seen as a poisoned chalice , but recent successes like The Last of and have seen the idea become more popular . With this idea only just getting off the ground and still wrapping up the issues surrounding its recent strike , it \\'ll likely be a good few years before we see this project hit the screen . Meanwhile , CD have already started development on Cyberpunk \\'s sequel . News has sadly broken of the death of - actor at the age of . Gambon had a long and distinguished career , and is best - known for his work with on and in the film series . Born in , in , moved to when he was five years old , later moving to with his family . His father ensured he became a citizen , but had an unhappy time at school , quitting at   to become an apprentice toolmaker . He was an avid cinema - goer but had little interest in pursuing acting until his early s. Lacking any experience , he wrote a fake resume and managed to blag his way into a series of acting roles on stage in . Success there led to several roles on the stage , where he met .

Gambon gained his slice of widespread fame by playing the role of in   episodes of historical drama The Borderers , from   to . He kept up a steady stream of roles on screen and on stage , but his next big break came in   when he joined forces with renowned , legendary screenwriter for his TV drama . Gambon \\'s portrayal of a writer crippled by illness and escaping into a fantasy world to avoid his pain was met with critical acclaim . The drama was hugely praised by screenwriter , and inspired the name of the band . \\'s star correspondingly rose and he picked up higher - profile roles on both television and film , such as and The , the Thief , His Wife , and Her Lover .

During a   appearance on in \" feature , he took a corner at the Top Gear test track on wheels , impressing the presenters so much they named the corner for him in perpetuity .

File under \" highly tenuous \" for now , but a couple of outlets are reporting rumours that has expressed an interest in developing a live - action \\'s series , based on the hot video game property . \\'s Gate III launched on PC at the start of August and reportedly sold copies in its first few weeks on sale   ( before it even launched on console ) , making it a remarkable success for something of an old - fashioned , party - based roleplaying game with turn - based combat . The game \\'s critical acclaim was also off the charts , with the game becoming PC \\'s highest - rated title in two decades . The game \\'s voice cast have become almost immediate , breakout stars , and the memes have been constantly flowing since the game \\'s launch . The \\'s Gate series comprises games and expansions in the core series and games in the spin - off series , as well as associated comics and roleplaying products . The series revolves around the titular city of , a great port on and a hugely important trading post for the region of the continent of . The city keeps getting into various scrapes , but of course handy adventurers keep showing up to help save it . The series is set within the much wider fantasy universe , created by writer in the s as a setting for short stories and worldbuilding as a hobby . He sold the setting to , the company behind , to be turned in an official setting in . Continuously in print since , the setting has sold of roleplaying products , tens of millions of novels and has been the setting for books and over video games . invented the city of in   for a short story called \" , \" whilst it got its mention in print in #   ( January   ) , as the home of a wizard who is an expert on basilisks .

However , have also been entertaining offers to divest   ( either spinning it off as an independent company or selling it outright , possibly to ) , in which case it is unclear what would happen to the rights . It is possible they might entertain an alliance with at that stage . Given the massive popularity of , I would n\\'t be surprised to see such a project go into development , but given the game is around   hours long with a massive cast and a story that can vary immensely from player to play based on the cumulative weight of of choices , it will certainly be a formidable challenge to bring the story to the screen . The has unveiled a new trailer for their upcoming trilogy of special episodes which will celebrate Doctor Who \\'s th anniversary . The trailer sees the Fourteenth Doctor   ( )   - who for unclear reasons has the exact same face and personality as his incarnation - arriving on contemporary to find the planet in danger   ( as per usual ) . A key to the puzzle lies with his former companion   ( ) , but the last time they met , the Doctor had to wipe her memory of him to save her life . Should she remember who he is , the results could be fatal . The trailer confirms the return of   ( ) , the head of , and also the arrival on of the mysterious   ( voiced by )   and their alien pursuers . Also appearing in this trilogy is a mysterious toyshop owner   ( ) , who appears to be an old acquaintance of the Doctor . The Fourteenth Doctor has to save the planet , stop his companion \\'s head exploding and pave the way for the arrival of his fifteenth incarnation   ( to be played by ) , all in just episodes . Doctor Who returns to the and , internationally , , around the time of the anniversary on   November , although precise airdates have yet to be confirmed . As well as the new episodes , there will be a Christmas special around   December before an - episode full season airs in the spring . A leaked schedule for video games from   suggests that the company was at least planning remasters for of their older titles , as well as a new game in of their biggest franchises . The leak appears to have been an accidental release of information as part of \\'s ongoing battle to clear international legal hurdles preventing its acquisition of . The schedule has known projects on which did eventually release   ( such as and ) , as well as unannounced games including . The leak also suggests that envisages just a three - year wait for , the follow - up to the much - acclaimed   title . Even though the list is official , we should take it with a grain of salt as it is very clearly outdated . The list is pre - COVID , and the pandemic caused massive delays and multiple project cancellations in many companies . It \\'s not clear which of the projects on the list remain extant   ( beyond the already - confirmed ) .The list also indicates that both The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion   (   )   and Fallout    (   )   are to be remastered , not remade . This would likely be a moderate graphical overhaul and some minor technical and improvements   ( similar to the recent , somewhat underwhelming remaster )   but otherwise leaving the games alone . This is notable as a group of fans have been remaking Oblivion for the past decade with considerably more advanced graphics and a full overhaul drawing on later games like Fallout    ( , itself already confirmed as getting a next - gen remaster and re - release next year ) . This project , known as Skyblivion , is currently due for release in   and has \\'s support   ( as well as persistent rumours that may make it an official release if the quality is high enough ) . An Oblivion remaster may be redundant in that case , but it \\'s worth noting that back in   there was widespread scepticism over any of these fan remasters actually being finished . Three years later and with more in - depth coverage of the project \\'s development , Skyblivion does indeed appear very close to completion . Dishonored   is a welcome idea . Dishonored   (   )   and    (   )   are of the greatest video games of the last decade and cemented reputation for great game design and fantastic worldbuilding . Deathloop   (   )   - set in the same world albeit in a different game genre - also did well . However , the underwhelming commercial performance of   (   )   and Redfall   (   )   has somewhat damaged \\'s reputation , alongside the departure of much of the team at the company behind its earlier games . There will be likely scepticism that the remnants can deliver a worthwhile successor , especially as stand - alone expansion : Death of the Outsider   (   )   delivered a pretty final ending to the story of the series . Deathloop takes place in the same world and does open up some more narrative possibilities for that setting , so a further game in the series might have some legs to it . Finally , the list suggest that will follow three years after the release of . Given \\'s two - year delay from the list , that suggests they may be envisaging a   release date for . With only recently spooling up full - time work on the game , that feels very optimistic . Many fans have been projecting a release date of   on the low end to   on the higher . The leak is interesting , but as yet none of the projects mentioned on it beyond and the Fallout   remaster have been formally confirmed . Piranha Games have announced that : Clans is in development , targeting a   release date . The game is a stand - alone companion title to :   (   ) .Unlike the open - world , is a linear game featuring sequential missions . Set several years after the end of \\' last expansion , , the new title sees invaded by the , a number of small but powerful factions who fled centuries ago . The field more sophisticated technology and weaponry than the Inner Sphere and believe they have a destiny to reconstruct , the mighty interstellar empire whose collapse led to the current era . The player is a belonging to who climbs the ranks during , particularly Smoke \\'s invasion of the Draconis Combine . Intriguingly , previous lore had established as villains , or at least somewhat villainous , suggesting this new game will have you playing the bad guys , or it might attempt to fill in more detail and colour to the faction . The game will see you commanding a - Mech unit as the war grinds on . If you want to catch up on a guide to the franchise \\'s lore , I have you covered here . The game does not require : to play or run . fans do have some more content incoming , though , as Piranha will release The Dragon \\'s Gambit later on this month , a -mission DLC which sees the player \\'s mercenary company allying with the Draconis Combine during . PC video game distribution platform Steam turns twenty years old today . Normally that would n\\'t be a major milestone outside of technical interest , but \\'s achievements and position in the industry remain unique , despite some criticisms . PC games company launched Steam on   September . The - and for a while only - thing you could do on Steam was use it to patch up your existing Steam games , particularly . The service did not even have a store front on release . Valve had identified the enthusiasm for online multiplayer early , but also identified that many gamers experienced frustration when new patches were released , as these tended to be released ad hoc and it sometimes took days for them to be disseminated over the entire playerbase . Valve proposed developing a universal updating service with several other companies , including , but were shot down . They began development of their own service in . This idea was n\\'t totally new , as had released their . Net service at the end of , but was working on a different scale . Valve quickly realised the same system could be used to sell and download games in their entirety . ran videos and interviews demonstrating how this would work with the video game , with the entire game being downloaded over broadband in just a few hours . Ironically , would not be actually released on until .Valve also sold the benefits of the service for combating piracy , which was widely believed at the time to be killing the PC gaming market . This led to consternation from gamers , already wary of   ( )   software trying to restrict when and where they could play games . To assuage concerns , also demonstrated that the system could be used as a mass distribution system for free mods by releasing the popular mod Day of Defeat on the service . After a successful launch , shut down all of their other online matchmaking and updating websites and systems , effectively forcing gamers to migrate to Steam over the course of , to some controversy . On   November , released . of the most eagerly - awaited games of all time up to that point , preceded by months of hype ,   was sold at retail and as a download , but all copies of the game had to be activated and authenticated on , even if the game was to be played solely offline in single - player mode . This led to vast criticism and anger from both critics and the gaming community , as broadband internet was still in its relative infancy . However , stuck to their guns and the game \\'s overwhelmingly positive reviews saw a copies sold worldwide within a relatively short timeframe . Shortly after release demonstrated the versatility and convenience of Steam by releasing an extra bonus level , via the service . In   Valve signed its distribution agreement with - party vendors . The - party game was , followed quickly by the more acclaimed . Over the next few years numerous other publishers and developers jumped on board , attracted by the company \\'s generous royalty cut   ( far superior to boxed retail ) . Critics continued to complain loudly about the service being a form of intrusive , but fans began to see the convenience of having all their games , multiplayer services and achievements in place . It is possible that Steam would have remained a relatively minor success , especially as proved reluctant to release more high - profile original games , but the PC gaming market underwent serious contraction after the release of the   console in   and the   the following year . Both consoles had comparable power to gaming PCs of the time and pushed the development of HD graphics at a much more affordable price . The result was something of a stampede of gamers to the new consoles , including PC gamers who previously would have not considered switching to console but were lured over by the likes of the Halo series on . Previously PC - centric developers like were also focusing heavily on the console versions of their next - generation games , like The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion   (   )   and Fallout    (   ) . For several years the future of PC gaming appeared to be in doubt . The result was an explosion in the indie game sector starting in the late s , alongside using numerous inducements to try to get PC publishers and developers to rally around as a centralised , global launch platform for their games . Valve also initiated aggressively - priced \" , \" sometimes selling games just a year or old for heavy discounts . This approach proved successful , if again controversial , and PC games began to see an uptick in sales again towards the end of the decade . A good sign of \\'s success was the appearance of competitor products : launched   ( aka , later )   in November   and launched in June .An earlier competitor was company CD . The company had enjoyed success by launching its original game ,   ( as well as physical release )   in . In   they launched , a variation on which focused on older , out - of - print games and employing patches and community knowledge in making them compatible with modern systems . won early victories by recruiting and to their cause . In , rebranded as , they carried out a successful relaunch spearheaded by the re - release of classic . Valve noted \\'s success and began launching older games themselves , although generally without the care and attention spent on compatibility . By the early s , Steam had established itself as the de facto global PC games storefront , to the point that many bricks - and - mortar video game stores dramatically reduced or even removed physical PC games from sale . Most games sold physically still needed to be activated on anyway . Steam users became numerous and passionate , calling for boycotts of other launchers from companies who refused to release on as well , citing the inconvenience of managing multiple launchers and software . The success of Steam also encouraged the further development of , and \\'s inhouse storefronts for their consoles   ( several attempts to create console versions of Steam came to nothing ) .By , most rivals had admitted defeat , with both and agreeing to release their games via Steam once again . In   discontinued Origin in favour of , which allows former players to continue accessing their games . In late , , flush with cash from their game , launched a service designed to directly take the fight to . The Epic Game Store used aggressive pricing , a more generous royalty scheme and the promise of completely free games to aggressively expand . However , the service was hugely criticised during its launch phase for lacking basic functions like a shopping basket and user reviews , whilst \\'s attempt to lock in some games to exclusivity periods with them in return for buckets of cash was criticised as anti - consumer . It took several years to implement basic features and remains controversial , despite the number of exclusives tailing off as developers discovered that the bad will engendered from not launching on Steam often outstripped the short - term financial benefits of accepting \\'s pricing terms . Steam enjoyed a further shot in the arm thanks to the pandemic , with the number of people using the service seeing a sharp increase as they were stuck at home with , in some cases , not much to do other than play video games . In , Steam is the overwhelmingly dominant games delivery service for the PC format . The service continues to set new records for concurrent players - the latest high of was reached earlier this year - and now every major publisher and almost all publishers full stop use Steam as their main launch system . Rivals continue to hang in there - GoG has continued goodwill from its attempts to track down and release older games and is continuing to try to make inroads through exclusives and free games - but many have thrown in the towel and admitted defeat . and its monopoly - like position in the marketplace continue , with criticism of the service sometimes pushing shovelware games released without much attention to quality   ( or sometimes copyright ) . The service has sometimes been used for cheating , toxic behaviour and even fraudulent activities , which Valve has sometimes acted decisively to stamp out and , at other times , less decisively . However , Steam has also been praised for almost single - handedly saving PC gaming as a viable format during the - period when its future might otherwise have been in doubt , and for prioritising convenience and ease of use for customers . Probably the biggest and most viable criticism of has been its impact on Valve , its creators . Valve used to create vibrant , exciting and original video games . Steam has given them an astonishing annual income   ( comfortably in the billions of dollars )   which frees them from having to rush games or , indeed , do much work on original games at all . Although Valve continued to publish popular titles in the first few years after launched - Portal   (   ) ,    (   ) ,   (   ) , Portal    (   ) , Global Offensive   (   )   and    (   )   - it is also unquestionable that their financial security has meant they are not under any pressure to actually make new games . The Half - Life franchise was left on a massive cliffhanger with the release of in   and the company has so far failed to follow up on it , although prequel : Alyx   (   )   hints at how the series might continue . My main abiding memory of the time I used was strewing network cables across my house , to my landlady \\'s consternation , as I tried to get   to work on its release day . I now have   games on the service with some , hours spent on them   ( which is n\\'t as bad as I \\'d feared , spread over nineteen years ) . My most - played games on the service are Age of Empires II : , The Elder Scrolls V : , , : Enemy Unknown / Enemy Within , , Mass Effect : , Grand Theft Auto IV / Episodes from and . Many of the criticisms and wariness about the service remain valid , but I think without Steam , it \\'s questionable if PC gaming would have survived , let alone thrived as it has . Thanks to good detective work by channel ! , there are well - supported indications that The actress has been cast in the third season of the show . is best - known for her role on all six seasons of The Expanse , playing . Her performance on that show was highly acclaimed , and led to her being cast in numerous geek - friendly projects . However , her acting career goes right back to the late s , when she debuted in films in her native . She moved to the and then after the   and began acting in projects there , achieving a breakthrough for her role in   (   ) . Her TV roles included , , , of , .

In the books , is initially a difficult - to - read figure who may be an ally but also an enemy of al\\'Thor . subsequently responded positively to fans on suggesting she audition for the role , leading to an exchange with showrunner .

She relocates to , where \\'s daughter is studying to be , to better guide her education . Although I think would be a better than , she would still be excellent in that role . It may be that \\'s role in the show will be reduced compared to the books , in which case casting a lower - profile actress for that role might make more sense   ( has been mentioned several times in the series , so will probably appear in some form ) , whilst will be a more important figure who debuts earlier and plays a bigger role in events . We await full confirmation from as to \\'s casting and what role she will be playing , but overall this is excellent casting news .

During that time , Volition were responsible for some of the most beloved titles and series in those respective eras . The decision to shut down came after the disappointing performance of their latest game , a reboot of their Saint \\'s Row series , and their acquisition by mega - company . Volition started life in   as , where they started work on a game called . After various deals with publishers fell through , they teamed with to release the game , now retitled Descent , in . The game was immediately noteworthy for its D graphics and its fast - paced combat . Alongside the following year \\'s Quake , the game became a testbed for D graphics cards . The game was quickly followed by   (   ) .The company rebranded itself as Volition and released its space space combat simulator Descent : Freespace - The Great War   ( aka Conflict : Freespace - The Great War in some territories )   in , to immense critical acclaim . The game was praised for taking on and Wing Commander series and beating them both at their own game . They followed up on the game with the massively - praised    (   ) , widely regarded even today as the single finest space combat simulator of all time . Unfortunately , a cutting of content , budget issues , no marketing and the collapse of the space combat market   ( which also adversely affected the same year \\'s X - Wing : Alliance )   led to the game being released with relatively little fanfare and extremely disappointing sales . Freespace   would go on to enjoy an extremely long tail in sales and a vibrant modding scene that continues to this day . In   Volition released , a well - received action based around characters recruiting monsters they could release into combat . As part of the marketing campaign , Volition teamed with the comedy group to create a - themed comedy video , in which characters from both and the in - development team up to play D&D. The video was an early memetic success , and was also used to tempt video gamers to try out the then - newly released rd itself . Lines like , \" Where is ? \" and \" I attack the darkness ! \" occasionally crop up in tabletop games to this day . Summoner   followed in .In   Volition released , a - person shooter set on . The game was noteworthy for its destructible terrain and scenery , with players able to blast through walls to create alternate paths through maps . The game was a huge , smash hit for Volition and was followed by sequels : Red Faction II   (   ) , Red Faction : Guerrilla   (   )   and Red Faction :   (   ) .In   Volition released their and only licensed game , The Punisher   (   ) , which saw reprise his role as from the film of the same name . In   Volition made their biggest gamble by deciding to take on and the Grand Theft Auto series . Volition \\'s equivalent series , , leaned into \\'s ruder , wilder and more insane side , although not quite to start with . Saint \\'s Row   (   )   and    (   )   at least nominally focus on the gritty underworld crime dealings of , but become more focused on the doings of crazy characters like   ( )   as the series progressed . By Saint \\'s Row : The   (   )   the series had become a satire of both the format and the glorification of criminal excess , with the game focusing on the becoming a media brand and empire . Saint \\'s Row IV   (   )   saw the take over and fight to save from aliens who had conquered the planet and effectively digitised it , with the fighting inside a computer programme which gave them superpowers . Saint \\'s Row : of Hell   (   )   saw the going to Hell to fight Satan , as you do . Aware that they had maxed out the viewer disbelief of the series , Volition decided to create a side - game only nominally set in the same universe , Agents of Mayhem   (   )   and then a full reboot of the series , relocating the game to a new city with a new gang and more grounded tone , in the annoyingly - named   (   ) . Neither game caught gamers \\' imagination , with the reaction to   (   )   being particularly hostile due to the abandoning of previous fan - favourite characters and storylines . acquired the studio in , but after the initial release and disappointing reception to   (   ) , they rotated management and oversight of the studio to another subsidiary , . As a result of declining revenues and debates over where to take the studio next , it was then decided to shutter the studio permanently . Sad news . , , and are all very worthy franchises , with excellent games and some great ideas circulating around them . Volition were never afraid to take on the big boys and win , and their no - holds - barred attitude was refreshing in an industry that all too often plays it safe . Unfortunately , it seems their downfall was kowtowing to corporate requirements to be safe and predictable , with   (   )   not being a bad game , just a redundant one once they abandoned the very thing that set them apart , their absurdist side and idiosyncratic sense of humour . Hopefully the staff at will find new roles , and will let some of their franchises live again in new titles that do n\\'t completely miss the point of the originals . In sad news , developers will be shutting down following the release of their most recent game , . The - based team are best - known for their thematic trilogy of stealth games inspired by classic s titles and . The company started off in   with mobile title daWindci , before developing the colourful platformer The Last Tinker : City of Colors   (   ) . They switched gears to their stealth tactics game ,   (   ) , an extraordinarily accomplished and impressive title . The team got to work with of their inspirational IPs when they then made   (   ) . They returned to the success of their title with a stand - alone expansion ,   (   ) , before developing their last game . Shadow Gambit : The Cursed Crew   (   )   is a much less linear and more open title than their previous games , whilst preserving their stealth focus . Despite extremely strong reviews , initial sales were disappointing , likely a result of the game launching almost exactly between of the biggest titles of the year   (   and ) .According to the managers , developing these games one after the other proved extremely taxing and expensive , and faced with the prospect of doing it all again , they decided instead to call time on the company . It will wind up over the next few months whilst releasing patch and balance updates for . This is sad news , as \\'s style of stealth tactics gameplay was extremely addictive , resulting in polished , challenging games which rewarded ingenious and original play . Hopefully another team will pick up the baton of continuing this style of title . , the President of , has relocated from   to , which will serve as the new base for the . A routine inspection of a new power plant inadvertently dislodges in time , sending him through a series of alternate timelines where his life , and the fate of the galaxy , took a very different turn . Somehow , he has to find his way home . is the animated film in the   franchise and the new instalment of any kind since the release of DVD movie in . The animated medium allows the surviving actors to reprise their roles and also allows new actors to take over the roles of those actors who are sadly no longer with us   ( and , as oft - discussed , \\'s attrition rate of actors has been extraordinarily high ) .The main appeal of is nostalgia : the animated film is so steeped in deep cut lore references to the original show that I \\'m not sure how much newcomers will get out of it , let alone the massive spoilers it contains for the events of the series . For a B veteran , it is tremendous fun to once again see , , , , and reprise their roles as , Ivanova , , Lochley , and respectively . in particular slips back into his role as if time has passed , and his vocal delivery is spot - on   ( apart from , the other actors do have some of the sound of the intervening three decades in their voices ) . The newcomers are mostly decent , with outstanding in replicating both and vocal performances as Commander and . has the hardest job in replicating the unique vocal stylings of and wisely does n\\'t even try , instead choosing a similar haughty tone and making it his own . The character animation is very nice , with a good amount of expression captured from the original actors , although the space is sadly disappointing and lacking in detail : ships look like unfinished pieces of clay and the Starfuries look like their mid - s models . It \\'s genuinely disappointing to see the spacecraft looking so lacking compared to their original incarnations , despite some good design ideas   ( the warships now having moving protuberances , for example ) .In terms of story and character , is a mixed bag . flipping between time streams is a nice reuse of story elements from the Season   - parter War Without End , but this promising idea is wasted slightly in revisiting scenes and ideas from the original show that we already saw decades ago . Newcomers will be lost without context and fans will find this material redundant . As the movie wears on and we get into newer ideas and start seeing alternate timelines where things unfolded differently , things pick up . It \\'s also nice to get to see things we never saw in the original show , like a planet - killer in full action and a jump gate in operation . But whilst that kind of trivia satisfies , there are also a bevy of continuity errors elsewhere that grate . As a   project , the film has a lot of wince - inducing dialogue and awful humour , which was a hallmark of the original show , and to be frank would be missed if it was n\\'t present at least to some degree . However , the original show balanced that out with some beautiful speeches and occasional gags that worked well . The latter are mostly missing from this movie . This movie also mistakes long - worn - out memes as humour , so we get a ton of focusing on his \" comic elements \" and completely missing the pathos and tragedy that made the character so compelling on his original appearance in the episode . Tone is something the movie struggles with a lot : the film feels too light and funny for the massive , grave stakes of the story , and any notion of subtlety from the original series has been lost . In the original , the were master manipulators who rarely emerged from the darkness and worked through disposable intermediaries and minions . Here , they are recklessly suicidal drones who directly attack enemies in swarms , not caring how many die in the process . The movie   ( * * )   leaves a   fan feeling conflicted : it is undeniably fun to see these characters again , and it \\'s particularly gratifying to see an actual sequel project involving almost the entire cast of the show , for the time since the end of the original series   ( the various spin - off media and DVD movies since then have involved just a few characters , or newcomers ) . The animation is solid , the voice acting mostly excellent , and at -ish minutes the film does not outstay its welcome . But the story feels a little pointless , the humour is often painful and the \" alternate universe \" set up in the movie as a possible future setting for new material is   ( at least at this prototypical stage )   uninspiring . The film is available on DVD , and digital platforms now . Thank you for reading .

A new mothership , the Khar - Kushan , has been constructed and launched under the guidance of a new , a scientist neurally wired into the ship to act as its living intelligence system . The primary threat in the new game is \" the , \" an artefact capable of destroying planets and shutting down . , from , is missing in action along with her fleet , leaving her successor and distant kin to guide on a new mission . S\\'Jet \\'s mission is complicated by the emergence of a new polity , the , whose motives are initially unclear . Homeworld   will be released on PC in February . The family are confused when they drive through a small town only to find themselves repeatedly driving back through it again , whatever route they attempt to take . The locals tell them they are trapped in a snowglobe , a town which is normal enough during the day but at night is besieged by strange , human - looking monstrous creatures who only want to torture and kill . The family , and the locals , decide to try to find a way to escape . Back in the late s , every other show on television was a supernatural mystery thriller , inspired by the runaway success of . Most of those shows crashed and burned without a trace , with the arguable biggest success - Fringe - both using some of the same creative firepower as and also doing enough differently that it did n\\'t come off as a lame cash - in . The last few years have seen a resurgence of such shows , most successfully with \\'s . From is in a similar vein , but taps some of the original team , with Lost producer - director and Fringe writer - producer   ( who also wrote a few episodes of )   acting as producers on this show , along with - time showrunner . From , at glance , resembles some of those older shows in its construction . The central mystery is where the hell the town is   ( people stumble across it from all over ) , why and how it keeps people trapped , and how people can escape , not to mention the nature of the creatures that keep attacking it . The show balances exploring these mysteries with more character - driven stories about both the town \\'s existing residents and the newcomers . The family - father , mother , daughter and young son - act as our eyes and ears in this world , sharing their confusion over how they got stuck in the town and how it should be possible to flee . The show stumbles a little bit compared to early Lost , which remains a masterclass in how to deliver a huge amount of interesting character introductions and exposition in a pilot , attached to a well - crafted story . From \\'s characters are less immediately compelling and it takes a few episodes for them to become anywhere near as interesting . It does n\\'t help that ostensible co - lead   ( a game but under - challenged )   is a little bland as a character . More compelling are Catalina   ( Oscar - nominated for of )   as his wife and genre stalwart   ( also of , but also the films , Oz and Romeo+Juliet )   as the town sheriff . Perrineau in particular gives a very strong performance as \\'s desperation to protect the people and find a way to escape is palpable , and later flashbacks show the horrible decisions he \\'s had to make along the way to keep people safe . The town is split into groups , with group living down in the houses in along the main road and another living in , a very large house atop a nearby hill , which is a bit more hippy - ish . The family becomes divided between the locations due to family drama , which the show maybe leans a bit more into than it should . From \\'s biggest early problem is trying to feel fresh whilst indulging in over - familiarity . character has a crush on another but can not articulate it . Other characters are having visions and weird dreams which may be clues to the mystery or might just be the logical outcome of stress . brilliant but socially ill - adjusted character   ( with shades of Baltar from )   is trying to find a way out but is constantly frustrated by the stupidity of everyone around them . There is tension between the people who \\'ve been in town for a while and made a life for themselves   ( albeit one that \\'s dangerous ) , and the latecomers who are more focused on escape . There \\'s only so many shows with psychic kids that one can take . A late - season obsession with erecting a radio tower to send out a mayday makes think of \\'s season obsession with a raft , and both shows have something odd happening underground . Still , if From is ploughing a familiar field , at least it does so entertainingly . Once the few episodes , with their clumsy exposition and stodgy pacing , are out of the way , the show does a better job of rotating between the character dramas and the mysteries . A devastating late - season event does a great job of raising the tension , whilst the finale builds up to a nice series of cliffhangers   ( and , as the second season is already available , it \\'s not a major issue to roll straight into the next batch of episodes ) .Scepticism over the show \\'s long - term viability is natural , and certainly From   ( * * * )   does n\\'t start with the verve and confidence of either or , but give it a few episodes to heat up and eventually a reasonably interesting horror - mystery drama emerges . The show airs on MGM+ in the and on in the . A second season is already available , and a third season has been commissioned . Thank you for reading .

You\\'re having the definition of a bad day : you \\'ve woken up with a severe case of amnesia in a stranger \\'s backyard . And you \\'re also about tall . Surviving the myriad hazards of the giant backyard and finding a way of getting back to your proper size is not going to be easy . , and their preceding incarnation as , have spent a quarter of a century crafting intricately - designed , well - written roleplaying games . They created the Fallout franchise as \\'s inhouse team , crafted : Torment   ( still often cited as the greatest of all time )   as , and as delivered the critically - acclaimed   ( if janky )   , Alpha Protocol ,   and Fallout : , among others . In the last decade they have been heavily involved in creating retro - style CRPGs with universe and the chronically underrated Tyranny , as well as returning to full D , - person CRPGs with the decent - but - unspectacular . It \\'s therefore a surprise to see turning around and making a survival and crafting game , especially a somewhat cartoony - looking one , apparently designed to appeal to children . But , impressions aside , ends up having more in common with their previous roster of games than you \\'d think . Grounded plays like many such games in the genre , but its mix of accessibility and a strong focus on story makes it feel like a spiritual successor to , the previous \" survival game for people who do n\\'t normally like survival games \" . Like that game , you start off in a highly precarious position , effectively abandoned in a hostile landscape with no food , no water , no weapons and no real idea of what to do . Fortunately , you quickly discover miniaturised shelters and supplies scattered across the backyard , confirming you \\'re not the victim of the shrink ray   ( and , if playing in co - op mode , \\'s ace card for gameplay , that quickly becomes obvious ) . You also soon find a friendly miniature robot who quickly sets you on the road to success . As wit \\'s aquatic predecessor , it \\'s impressive seeing how quickly you can go from having nothing to living in a massive base protected by tough defences . Grounded deviates from that game in very major way : combat . The yard is crawling with hostile wildlife , including mosquitoes , wasps , , stinkbugs , and angry little mites . There are other creatures who are indifferent or even friendly to you , but their bodies can be harvested for essential supplies or for food , including ladybugs , ants , aphids and weevils . Combat plays out like a simpler version of a , with each creature have a distinct attack pattern heralded by animations and sound effects . Periodically you encounter larger boss creatures , who require much more work to defeat . How much you like may depend on your attitude to combat in a survival game . If you see it as a good thing , is a great game with lots of varieties of enemies and how to handle them . If you see combat as a distraction from base - building and crafting , then the amount of combat in the game will likely get on your nerves . Building and crafting is fun , but not massively necessary to complete the game . I constructed a very small , modest base with just the essentials for getting food , water and creating new weapons , equipment and armour . Later on I did erect a large tower and built ziplines from the tower to distant corners of the garden , allowing relatively rapid transit from a central base to other locales , which made the latter part of the game easier than might have otherwise been the case . Graphically , the game is superb . This was the game I played on my new -powered system and the result is a glorious riot of colour and foliage , rendered impressively in I did experience occasional CTDs without an obvious explanation , which encouraged regular saving   ( you can also set the frequency of autosaves ) . Controls were responsive , and base - building was pretty easily accomplished . Inventory management could be a little better , with the sheer number of useful tools and the need to carry different armour loadouts   ( some armour renders you invisible to the creatures that armour is made from )   making it easy to out the hotbars the game gives you , but it \\'s not a major problem . The game is also playable from both person and person perspectives , which is very welcome . The game \\'s narrative provides a good sense of direction , and the story   ( initially unfolding via audio logs but later through more direct interactions with NPCs )   is bittersweet , with some harsh decisions and character twists being revealed . There \\'s also some branching to the narrative : going off - mission and exploring remote parts of the yard can open up new storylines or impact the main quest , leading to a better   ( or worse )   outcome . There \\'s optional boss hiding in a remote corner of the yard whose defeat reveals major information about the story that otherwise you \\'ll never encounter . The yard itself is brilliantly - designed and one of the most entertaining recent game worlds . The central grasslands give way to the mysteries of the impenetrable hedge   ( with an important base located high up in its twisted branches )   and the depths of the koi pond . If you can avoid the indestructible koi guardian of the pond and work out how to preserve your oxygen supply , massive underwater rewards await . Later , you can travel to the sandpit , a vast desert realm suffering an inconvenient antlion infestation , and once you can access to explosives you can penetrate the rockwall to the upper yard , a punishing new biome that will tax your fighting and survival abilities to the maximum . There is a good   hours of entertainment here for a focused playthrough aimed at completing the story as efficiently as possible ; for those who want to build incredible bases or towers higher than the house , or grind for the best weapons and gear to fight the horrific broodmother optional boss , that enjoyment will easily last for multiples of that time . Grounded   ( * * * * )   is a big swing from , far outside their normal wheelhouse , but one that pays off handsomely . The game is fun , colourful , good - natured but not without its grim moments , and constantly challenging . It is available now on PC and Xbox consoles , via the usual vendors and .

The follow - up to   (   )   and \\'s Gate II : Shadows of   (   ) , the game is another fantasy roleplaying epic drawing on rules , with the player taking control of a motley crew and setting out to save the world , or at least to start with , their skulls . The game had a lengthy three - year gestation period in Early Access , during which time over two and a half million people played the game and received extensive feedback on how to improve balancing , combat , classes and characters . The extensive period and pre - release hype seems to have paid off . In the four days since release , the game has peaked at just under , concurrent players , making it the - most - played game in \\'s history . Larian have not disclosed how many additional sales were notched up in the release period , but the game has sat at the top of \\'s sales charts for a considerable chunk of that time . The game has likewise been the biggest - selling title on for the past week or so . \\'s \\'s sales are restricted to the PC format only for the time being . The game will launch on   on   September and an release is planned for later , although have encountered technical difficulties in getting the game to run well on the lower - specced console . They hope to resolve the problem soon . For myself , I \\'m a dozen hours into the game and so far it \\'s been a satisfying fantasy adventure . It may be some considerable time before a review , however . This is a very , very big game . , Commander of and , is having a very bad day . His wife is in labour with their child , and it is the thirtieth anniversary of of May . But rather than spending his day toasting fallen friends and greeting his child into the world , is instead chasing down , a notorious murderer and sociopath with a taste for killing . The inadvertent combination of a lightning strike with the standing magical field of transports both back to the week of , and has to stop Carcer and ensure that history unfolds precisely as it did before ... which is a bit difficult when their arrival brings about the death of \\' old friend and mentor before his time . There is nothing , or at least very little , as glorious in the world as Sir   ( )   on his best form . Released in , the Discworld novel holds a strong claim to be the series \\' very best , although it is a crowded field . As with the other   ( arguable )   leading candidate for that title , is a book that is both funny and angry . In the earlier novel , was furious over religious fundamentalism and how personal faith could and can be perverted into a force of oppression and evil . In he studies paranoia and fear , how crowds and masses can be moved by propaganda and oppressed by their own rulers because they fear them . The tone is darker and bleaker than most other books by design : this is n\\'t the cosmopolitan , successful of the later series , but an old , rough , poor and paranoid city ruled by a lunatic despot . There \\'s a sinister secret police force , there \\'s torture chambers and inquisitions , and there \\'s casual racism   ( as usual in the series , filtered through the lens of speciesism )   that takes even old - skool , dyed - in - the - wool copper Vimes by surprise . There is still humour here , but it \\'s grimmer and blacker than in most of his books . of the novel \\'s most impressive achievements is evoking such ideas and reaching such quality in the middle of one of the series \\' most tightly - woven sub - series . Small Gods was a complete standalone set long before the rest of the series , but is a key book in \" arc , with frequent continuity references to what \\'s been going in that storyline . However , fish - out - of - water setting does render that somewhat moot : you really just need to know that is a successful , reforming police commander with a pregnant wife and an ambiguously motivated boss . The book is dealing with a lot of inspirations : the cover   ( regular cover for the series following the passing of his more idiosyncratic predecessor , )   is a riff on \\'s \" , \" whilst the revolution itself plays on everything from to and even Bloody Sunday   ( the deployment of the military to deal with a civil order issue is uncomfortably on the nose , as it means to be ) . is not really interested in a : copy - past of the real events , though , and is more interested into delving into the rationales for civil disorder , for popular rebellions and mass uprisings , and if revolutions ever really change anything , other than just swapping the name on the door of the top office , and if today \\'s heroic revolutionary leader is tomorrow \\'s tyrannical despot .   ( * * * * * )   is still funny , but wraps the comedy around more serious , even grimmer themes than in many of his books . The story is excellent , the characterisation - especially of , who by this novel has become maybe \\'s richest protagonist - among \\'s best and the villain is one of the most genuinely hateful in the entire series . It \\'s also an interesting morality play on political states , the meaning of power , and how the masses can be harnessed for good and ill . Thank you for reading .

The lands of are threatened by the forces of the Dark Lord Sauron , who only needs to find the missing Ring to become unstoppable . Through an unlikely chain of events , the Ring has fallen into the possession of , an unassuming hobbit of the Shire . After retires , the Ring falls into the possession of his cousin . Finally realising the true nature of the Ring , the wizard Gandalf tells Frodo he must travel to \\'s stronghold of and climb the volcanic , the only place where the Ring can be destroyed . Reviewing The Lord of the is a bit like reviewing oxygen , or . People are probably already going to have read it , or decided not to . I ca n\\'t imagine there \\'s too many people sitting on the fence over it . Still , having just reread the whole thing , reviewing it is only polite . The Lord of the began life as a sequel to J.R.R. \\'s children \\'s novel , The , originally published in . The book rapidly spiralled out of \\'s control and foresight , becoming longer , darker and more epic . In truth , the book became more of a sequel to \\'s massive myth - cycle , the then - unfinished and unpublished Silmarillion   ( eventually published posthumously in   ) , adopting its epic themes but using the accessible relatability of the hobbits to make the book easier to swallow for a large audience . The Lord of the was eventually published in volumes   ( The Fellowship of the Ring , The Two Towers and The Return of the King )   in   and .The impact of The Lord of the can not be overestimated . It codified the entire category field of modern epic fantasy , and \\'s imitators and successors are legion , as are those consciously rejecting his influence and doing something completely different . With sales estimates running from to   ( the confusion caused by the novel \\'s division into - volume , - volume and even - volume editions , and vast numbers of pirate editions published globally since the book came out ) , The Lord of the is one of the biggest - selling individual novels of all time and has spawned a multimedia empire of radio , film and TV adaptations   ( of wildly varying quality ) .Cutting through all of this chaff , what of the novel itself ? How does it hold up in ? The answer is very well indeed , and in some respects the novel has aged better than expected . The explosion of massive epic fantasy series with individual volumes sometimes longer than The Lord of the in its entirety   ( achieved by and , and almost so by and )   has inverted the old criticism of the novel . Rather than overlong and ponderous , as it was felt to be by many in the s and s   ( when most novels clocked in at well under   pages ) , it now feels spry and economical with its pacing . The fact delivered a single novel that tells a massive , sweeping and complete story   ( even reading is not necessary )   with characters and spanning difference races , countries and an entire war , with incredibly detailed worldbuilding   ( most of it created just for this book ; relatively little was inherited from The , which took place in a different region of ) , is pretty remarkable by modern standards . The book opens in the bucolic and , despite later rewrites , this section never shakes off its origin point as : Somewhere Else and Back Again , Probably . There \\'s laughter and good cheer and a lot of light and humour . But the book switches almost on a dime when Gandalf tells Frodo of the Ring and sinister dark - hooded Riders arrive in the Shire . The initial flight from to Bree , with accumulating his loyal friends and allies , and , remains a masterclass of building tension . The book takes a longueur at , but it feels earned and is important for establishing the stakes of the story and establishing the Fellowship . The remainder of the part is delivering epic set - piece after another , from battling wolves on the slopes of to almost dying on the slopes of to the transition through to the battle on that leads to the splitting of the Fellowship . As himself acknowledged many years later , is very different to and The Return of the King . The instalment is lighter , pacier and more focused on a small , likable band of heroes engaged in an adventure . The latter parts split the Fellowship into smaller sub - groups and sees them allying with larger powers   ( the nations of and )   to fight \\'s armies on the battlefield , at and . is superb at building tension and delivering epic speeches but seems disinclined to dwell on the horrors of warfare up - close : those used to multi - hour action sequences based on those battles may be surprised by how concisely deals with them on the page . He is more interested in the story and what happens to his characters than filling his pages with carnage . These latter volumes remain fascinating and enjoyable , but they are drier . The moments of humour and cheer become sparser and \\'s prose becomes more academic , higher and more remote . is also an underrated master of horror . Throughout The Lord of the he adeptly deploys horror tropes to scare the bejesus out of the and the reader . This can be seen with the Black Riders in the Shire , the barrow - wights near and the descent through , and in the later confrontations with the great spider , , and the of the Dead . As once said , also gives great monster . Between Shelob , the balrog , the cave trolls and wargs , the book is replete with excellently - designed terrors . Ultimately our heroes achieve their goals but the novel continues for another   pages after that , with the hobbits returning home to find that the war has not spared the home front and they have to undertake a final quest , this time by themselves without their powerful allies . For , was a vitally important part of the novel about how , after taking part in a war and experiencing trauma , you can never quite go home again . This gives The Lord of the its bittersweet complexity : the war is won but the damage it wreaks on the winners - or survivors - is palpable . The novel has its weak points . is a skilled poet in the short form but a more awkward one at length , and the novel features several verses that go on for several pages . Whilst the novel overall packs a ton of story , character and theme into a pages , it does have moments where it slows down dramatically and takes a few pages to get going again . In - depth psychological characterisation is not something that is really interested in , along with modern ideas about when to signify switches . This is not to say there is no characterisation , and indeed the hobbits in particular go through impressive character growth as the book develops , but it \\'s less obvious than in many modern novels . The greatest exception is , who is torn by competing internal forces through the book as he strives for redemption but is tempted by a return to villainy . A more valid criticism   ( both modern and contemporary )   is almost the complete lack of female characters : himself had already   ( by this point )   developed important female characters in The Silmarillion who have impressive agency and play important roles in the story   ( such as , , and ) , but in Lord of the the sole female character of almost any note is . did write more material for , but removed most of her story to the appendices . Other female characters   ( , , )   appear only fleetingly . This does add to the WWI - esque atmosphere that develops , with women as a symbol of aspiration and home , but it \\'s probably the area where the novel has aged the most poorly . The Lord of the   ( * * * * * )   is a titanic presence in the field of fantasy : no other single novel is as influential in its genre , even if it \\'s perhaps less dominant these days than it used to be . It \\'s easy to dismiss or write it off as old - fashioned or outdated , but this would be a mistake . delivers a huge story about fighting the forces of darkness , both the overt and the subtle , and overcoming internal trauma , in a manner that remains compelling . At its best , his prose is rich and engrossing and his descriptions impressive , although the prose does become drier as the novel proceeds and some later sections lack the flair and energy of earlier chapters . But overall The Lord of the remains a towering achievement of the genre and one that is worth reading . Thank you for reading .

Seminal epic space opera show   is to finally get a release on , after many , many years of campaigning by fans . The set will be released on   December this year in the , and some other territories . Babylon   aired for five seasons and TV movies , airing from   to . An additional TV movie and a direct - to - DVD film followed in   and , along with a -episode spin - off show , Crusade , in . Babylon   was reasonably successful on its airing , becoming the space opera to last for more than three seasons in television history . It won two Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation   ( for the episodes , in Seasons   and   respectively ) , along with an Emmy for visual effects . Babylon   helped pioneer the use of both CGI and long - term , serialised story arcs in a television series . The series was hugely influential on its contemporaries   ( such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer )   and succeeding shows , including , which borrowed ideas from its story arc structure . The show had a somewhat complex technical issue which has made re - releases problematic . Babylon   was one of the - if not the - American TV shows to be protected for widescreen shooting , with the plan to release the entire show in : widescreen ratio at a later date , after its original : airing . However , due to technical issues and communications mixups , the show \\'s then - cutting edge CGI was only produced in : . For the original TV release this was not an issue , but for the DVD release in , this created a technical headache , as fans and the studio wanted a release . Unable to afford the cost of recreating all the and composite scenes in : from scratch , the decision was made to use the live - action footage but to crop and zoom in on the shots . This created a widescreen presentation which lost detail and sometimes important CGI elements from those shots . For composite scenes , this also meant occasional but noticeable rapid zooming in and out of scenes as they alternated from pure live - action shots to composites . In ,   was released in a new \" remastered \" format . To create the best compromise version , remastered the live - action - only footage in HD and also carefully upscaled the shots via an algorithm . As these things go , this was not too terrible , and the improved live - action footage is impressive . However , to achieve a uniform presentation , they made the decision to crop the live - action shots back down to their original : presentation , and then keep the shots intact . As a compromise , this was reasonable , although frustrating for fans who wanted to see the show in HD and in widescreen . The only alternative is to completely re - render all of the show \\'s CG elements from scratch and in : . This is likely prohibitively expensive , as   sometimes had   or more shots in a single episode , and also requires all of the original greenscreen footage to have been preserved perfectly . A stopgap idea has been pursued by B fan for several years , involving taking the original shots , ship models and scene files and re - rendering them in : and in HD   ( or even K )   using modern PCs . This produces a visually identical image to the original , but with a lot more detail   ( the original models were very exactingly built for the standards of the time )   and looks very nice today . However , this is only possible where all of that material has survived , either in the archive or in the archives of the various animators and teams that worked on the show . tracked down a lot of that material for Seasons   and , but for Season   only the models have survived , and for Seasons   and   it appears that very little has survived , so this is not a viable solution for the entire show . It also appears that the \" complete series \" title might be something of a misnomer . Based on the   re - release and some of the initial release info , it looks like the set will include of the original show , remastered , plus the pilot movie , which was not remastered   ( due to issues with the original source film ) . The other TV movies - In the Beginning , Thirdspace , River of Souls and Call to Arms - plus the spin - off show Crusade and the later TV / DVD movies and soon - to - be - released animated movie , do not appear to be included at this time . If it is confirmed that some or all of them will be included , this news will be updated . Space , the final frontier . And so forth . In the mid - rd Century , the Federation starship Enterprise explores strange new worlds under the command of Captain , making discoveries both wondrous and terrifying . Reviewing the original is a bit like reviewing oxygen   ( you \\'re not going to convince too many people about not using it ) , or Lord of the . People are probably already going to watch it or have decided not to . I ca n\\'t imagine there \\'s too many people sitting on the fence over it . Still , having just watched the whole thing , reviewing it is only polite . Perhaps the most succinct review of , as it is now doomed to be called , came from back in : \" episodes , about   good ones . \" This is maybe a little harsh but also not entirely untrue . Airing from   to    ( with an unaired pilot produced in   ) , was a product of s assembly line television , producing a mind - boggling   episodes in its first season alone . Episodes were not so much carefully written as thrown together in a mad rush , with location filming being a rare luxury and decent visual effects an even rarer one . If anything , it \\'s remarkable that holds together as well as it does , and when it works it \\'s still excellent television . The core of the show is the regular cast , particularly the triumvirate of as Captain , as and as Dr. : the action hero , the logical analyst and the emotional heart . This trio works extremely well , with consistently outstanding performances from and across the entire show   ( is easily the most underrated performer on the show and in the following movies , and is always a delight to watch ; \\'s brilliance has been extolled so much over the years it \\'s almost redundant to repeat it now ) . This focus on the core trio detracts somewhat from the wider cast : as Lt . , as Ensign Chekov , as Lt . and as Chief   ( with frequent guest appearances by as , and a rotating cast of recurring actors as crewmen , some of whom play multiple characters ) . The wider group gets relatively little time in the sun compared to the core , which feels a bit weird from a modern lens but was relatively normal practice at the time . From a performance perspective , is a fascinating study . He is , for the first half of the show , consistently very good . is authoritative , moral and decisive , balancing the logic of with the humanity of to good effect . In the latter half of the series , starting late in Season , it feels like he \\'s checked out a little . The much - lampooned cliches of over - enunciation , attempts at dramatic pauses   ( which just feel like he \\'s forgotten his lines midway through a speech )   and occasionally wild over - acting become much more pronounced . When he has a good day , or is in a good episode with good material , he is still great , but that does become less common as the third season goes on   ( his worst performance is easily in , which mercifully is also the last episode of the series ) .From a writing perspective , the show is often inventive , intriguing and relatively smart , at least in the early going . Later episodes tend to emphasise action and develop tropes that are so rapidly reused they become tedious : the godlike entity who can crush the and its crew any time they want , but they have to use and the crew as pawns in some game , and are eventually defeated either by semantic trickery or   ( less commonly )   some kind of technological breakthrough . The mysteriously loses the use of its weapons , shields and transporter so often that your eyes may roll into the back of your head . Kirk talks sentient computers into self - destruction frequently enough that you wonder why an anti - Kirk firmware update is n\\'t in circulation in the sentient evil computer club . But the show is also remarkably adept at employing metaphor : Let That Be Your Last Battlefield \\'s commentary on racism is so subtle it flew over the heads of some people , who wrote into the studio to complain that the near - identical aliens hating one another on the basis of skin colour alone was stupid   ( right in the middle of America \\'s Civil Rights period ) . It also sings when it moves away from the all - powerful aliens trope to more even engagements : Balance of Terror \\'s submarine - inspired tension is superb , and Space Seed \\'s battle of intellect and wills between and genetically - engineered warlord is excellently portrayed . The battle between Federation starships and a powerful   ( but not unbeatable )   planet - killer in is outstanding . The Devil in the Dark is possibly the show \\'s best statement on how to respect and treat sentient life even if it looks and acts nothing like you are used to . Like most shows of the period , the idea of \" worldbuilding \" is absent as a conscious idea , but when it strays into it , it is excellent , such as with our visit to in and the Federation conference in . The Klingons and are both intriguing enemies , although the portrayal of the lacks depth   ( maybe aside from in Day of the Dove ) ; the appear less frequently but more memorably , with both and being series highlights . The show also gives good comedy , with both The Trouble with Tribbles and A Piece of the Action emerging as comic powerhouses   ( and having its moments ) . was definitely less keen on comedy episodes , feeling they encouraged people to mock the show , but it \\'s something has been consistently pretty good at over many different shows and episodes . The show is also adept at existential horror , particularly in the early going through episodes like Where No Man Has Gone Before and which make you wonder how the hell got its reputation as a family show with a lot of charm : these episodes are cold , bordering on the bleak at times . That concept does n\\'t really emerge until the latter part of Season   and really sings in Season . It \\'s been said so many times as to be redundant now , but   sees a marked slump in quality , with some of the worst episodes of the show and the franchise like . Excellent episodes still crop up amongst the dross , like and , but it can be hard going . Production value - wise , the show is obviously almost sixty years old so does n\\'t look fantastic . Location shooting is a bonus , hugely enhancing episodes like , but most episodes are forced to rely on sets   ( of wildly varying effectiveness )   to portray exterior locations . Makeup and prosthetics are mostly underwhelming , but imaginative design can help overcome that : the looks weak , but the drama of the script helps overcome these deficiencies . Modelwork and space shots are often decent , and the   remastered version of the show is excellent for updating the space shots whilst staying true to the original design intentions . In a similar vein , the show has some wince - inducing dialogue and ideas about the treatment of women and minorities compared to modern shows , but in other respects , and especially by the standards of the day , the show is remarkably progressive   ( and later shows are n\\'t always fantastic in this regard either ) .Star Trek :   ( * * * * )   is , in some respects , dated . But in many others it is remarkably watchable , with frequently great performances . It mixes horror , comedy and action - adventure to good effect . It set the scene and groundwork for the most successful franchise of all time . Sure , there \\'s a fair number of episodes which are poor and do n\\'t work very well , but when the show does work - such as in on , Balance of Terror , Amok Time , , The Trouble with Tribbles and more - it remains excellent entertainment . The show is available right now in most territories via and on DVD and . Thank you for reading .

News has sadly broken that television writer has passed away at the age of . was best - known for his work on the franchise ,   and . Born in , in , studied at . He began his television writing career in   with an episode of , and became a regular writer on \\'s Dead at . Inbetween , he and wrote a script called , which became the - ever script to sell for over $ million . His show as creator and showrunner was    ( - ) , about a group of people who witness the destruction of and time travel back to avert the disaster . In   he began working on in its third season . His episode was , an ethically complex episode about cloning . The episode was hailed by both critics and cast as of the best episodes of the series . \\'s next several episodes were well - received , and he was quickly promoted to a producing role . For the show \\'s fourth and final season , was effectively promoted to showrunner , taking the creative reigns of the series   ( although and remained technically the executive producers in charge ) . The final season used a number of short - form story arcs to tell stories tying into the Star Trek mythos , particularly illuminating stories about the Mirror Universe , history and the ancestor of \\'s creator . Despite a warm reception , the change was too late to reverse the show \\'s commercial fortunes and it was cancelled . went on to write extensively for , penning episodes from   to , and , penning episodes from   to . He returned as a writer on : Live Another Day in   and co - created and wrote : Legacy in . went on to become a regular writer on and its anthology spin - off show , . was a lifelong fan with an encyclopedic knowledge of the franchise . It is interesting that he did not return to the franchise after its return to television in , and also did not work on homage show The Orville , which his colleague worked extensively . \\'s other interests included model trains and wine - making . passed away on Sunday   July from pancreatic cancer , which he \\'d been fighting for over a year . He is survived by his wife , mother , children and nieces and nephews . and are junior executives working at corporate mega - behemoth . Their preference is to take things easy and enjoy their paycheques ; unfortunately , their bosses and discover they can use and as their dogsbodies for whatever crazed money - making idea they are entertaining , to impress their bosses . HR representative is decidedly unhelpful . Meanwhile , CEO is trying to guide his corporation through perilous waters as he pivots from weapons manufacturing to getting in on the TV streaming wars . Corporate is a now - complete comedy series that ran for three seasons and   episodes on from   to . The idea of a show mocking work culture is not particularly new , with the likes of lampooning the lives of many people working in middle - end jobs . Corporate takes a different approach by going inside the skyscraper headquarters of a particularly morally dubious corporate super - entity , and also going in for tonal bleakness . A lot . In fact , when once again opens an episode of musing on the existential soullessness of a life spent behind a computer screen tapping buttons , you might be wondering where the jokes are coming from . Is n\\'t this just a statement of life ? But the show quickly escalates its musings on humdrum boardroom meetings and corporate buzzspeak to a more insane level , mainly thanks to the characters coming to the notice of their supreme leader , . is only in   of the episodes , but he is played by the late , fantastic . often plays law enforcement or military roles , and comedy is not one of his regular fortes . But in he is allowed to absolutely cut loose and he clearly relishes every second of it . Scenes where he begs on his hands and knees for a fellow corporate boss to licence him the rights to an older sitcom to bolster his flagging new streaming service , or castigates his executives for instituting \" casual Fridays \" without his knowledge , meaning he unexpectedly caught site of some of his male employees \\' knees to his distress , are played brilliantly . manages to steal every scene of the show and sometimes even scenes he is n\\'t even in , when you can imagine his character \\'s reaction to whatever mayhem the rest of the team has set in motion . The show is at its weakest when it \\'s merely saying , \" corporate culture is n\\'t great , right ? \" but absolutely at its best when it takes that idea and illustrates it through extremes . An episode where the corporation tries to co - opt a radical artist protestor without interfering in his vision , leading to them confusedly funding adverts making themselves look terrible , is a great example of corporations trying to be hip and failing hard . Even better is the streaming episode , which ends with making a nightmarish speech about acquiring and draining every bit of creativity from it and never letting it die , even if it means making spin - offs \" about characters who can not possibly sustain their own series . \" If there as ever a moment television got self - aware about itself , this was it . \"There will be sequels , prequels , reboots , remakes and ill - advised spin - offs with side characters that can not possibly carry their own series . We \\'ll give the fans everything they want , and much , much more . We \\'ll use an algorithm to churn out of scripts a day at virtually no cost . And sure , you \\'ll complain about how it used to be better , but that anger will unite you . And you \\'ll keep watching , hoping it will end , begging for it to end , and then you \\'ll all die . And your children will watch it too , and so on . We \\'re going to milk that creative until the UDDER RUNS DRY!\"This is the future of content , and WILL NEVER DIE!\"The show does n\\'t always knock it out of the park . does n\\'t have much characterisation beyond , \" hey , he \\'s weird , and every episode we \\'ll make him weirder , \" and a lot of the supporting cast does n\\'t have much to do . But the central cast   ( , as , as , as , as and as )   all give good to great performances and , mostly , the ideas work well . The funniest episodes are genuinely hilarious , and the occasional tonal shifts into melancholy or even nihilism are effective . Corporate   ( * * * * )   is an incisive , cutting and dark comedy that rarely stumbles and , in vainglorious CEO monster , it has a comedy character for the ages .

A fungal mass infection has overrun much of the world , killing and turning others into mindless , ravaging creatures . is tasked by a group known as the Fireflies with escorting -year - old Ellie across to safety . The Fireflies believe that Ellie \\'s genes hold the key to a cure for the infection . The Last of was a   video game from , the creators of the franchise . The game was a massive smash hit success , attracting praise for its emotional storytelling , dialogue , combat , characterisation and atmosphere . Its   sequel was somewhat more divisive but still mostly well - received . Inevitably , moves began to adapt the story as either a film or TV show . After several failed attempts , the project found a home at with writer - producer at the helm , joined by the game \\'s original creator and writer . The project still faced an uphill battle to succeed . TV has been awash with post - apocalyptic survival stories for well over a decade , with The Walking Dead   ( - )   being the most successful example , spawning multiple spin - offs . Other shows have had less success , with Y : The Last Man   (   )   failing to gain much ground and only lasting one season . More notably , video game adaptations still had a long track record of failure in other mediums , \\'s being the biggest exception   ( although that show benefitted from really only using characters and background lore , and crafting a new story ) .The Last of once again argues that has the touch , emerging as easily the best live action video game adaptation to date . It helps that the series is based on a linear video game with a very linear story , divided itself into sections that can easily be lifted out and converted into episodes . It also helps that the source material itself is so strong . The biggest success is in casting : can play \" adopted grumpy gunman protector - daddy \" in his sleep at this point , but still brings his A - game . does n\\'t hugely resemble the Ellie from the games , but has the requisite attitude , and and have a great relationship and energy   ( possibly inspired by both being Game of casualties ) . Other actors rotate in and out of the road trip and do a great job , with delivering the best guest performance of the season as . More under - used is the normally - outstanding , who is n\\'t given much to as   ( and from what we do see , it feels like her character - also a well - meaning psychopath - has been airdropped in for five minutes ) . The likes of , , , , and all provide excellent support . The structure of the series mirrors that of the games , but also breaks away for format - busting experiments . The episode , Long , Long Time , might be the season highlight as it follows libertarian prepper \\'s attempts to survive in the aftermath of the outbreak , and it turns from comedy to action to romance with conviction .   ( based on an expansion to the game )   is an excellent flashback episode focusing on \\'s history and what led her to joining forces with the Fireflies . Where the series falters a little is in some of the \" normal \" episodes , where the pacing can flag and where the show sometimes hesitates in how it deals with post - apocalyptic / zombie tropes that the likes of have employed a times over . A loved one is infected and needs to be killed / is allowed to make a noble sacrifice ? Yup , several times . Have the tough times have made some people resort to being murders / rapists / cannibals / murderous rapist - cannibals ? Oh yeah . At the merest sign of trouble , did about % of the population turn into authoritarian lunatics instantly ? Of course . To its credit , the show does its best to make these well - trodden plotlines work , sometimes successfully , at other times less so . This impacts on the pacing , with , once the flashback episodes are removed , episodes to tell its story and it still feels a little too long , which is odd given that the show runs to the length of the game . Still , the game can eat up a lot of its time in combat and stealth sequences which the show ca n\\'t , at least not so easily . But if the pacing is sometimes sluggish , there are also excellent moments of character development . It \\'s also refreshing to see an adaptation not afraid to adapt the source material . Entire scenes from the game are faithfully recreated in the show , occasionally dialogue - perfect . Other storylines are changed to accommodate the show \\'s greater sense of realism : fighting off the type of numbers that Ellie and Joel encounter in the game would look silly , or drag out too much . It \\'s a judgement call in each case and , for the most part , the show makes good calls . After a bunch of recent adaptations that seemed to be terrified of their own source material   ( The Rings of Power comes to mind ) , it \\'s good to see more in conversation with it . The show also makes good calls when it comes to CG . The increasingly all - invasive use of in modern TV and film has become tedious , leading to fake - looking backdrops all over the place . This show certainly uses CG in places , but it is more restrained and , as a result , more convincing . Arguably , the show even fails to use in moments when maybe it should have   ( painting out the massive mountains that have inexplicably appeared around might have been a good idea ) . The CG - animated cordyceps monsters are extremely well - realised , and used sparingly to good effect . Excellent performances , good action and strong character arcs make the first season of The Last of   ( * * * * )   a winner . Occasionally sluggish pacing and sometimes questionable story turns that seem rooted more in video game logic than actual logic prevent the show from being an unqualified success , but these issues are minor . The Last of proves that adult , intelligent and interesting adaptations of video games are possible , and hopefully more will follow . The TV show is available to watch on or in the and most overseas territories , and on Now TV in the UK.Thank you for reading .

Back home , they find the same old same old , leading to make a momentous decision . \\'s has always been to use surrealism and even horror to illuminate what should have been a fairly basic premise : an rapper hits the big time and hires his more grounded cousin to become his manager . The show not so much lowballs as absolutely forgets about that premise on a fairly regular basis to tell unrelated stories about everything else under the sun . In the third season , the show even chucked out its regular cast for its run to become an anthology show . The and concluding season of the show returns to and what vaguely approximates its standard format , of following its main characters as they consider the next stage of their lives , such musings interrupted by horrendously awkward social situations , ill - considered monetary decisions and continuously pervasive racism . If this was any other show , it \\'d be easy to say this was a \" back to basics \" season , but \\'s boundless inventiveness makes that a fairly meaningless statement . In the episode alone , is targeted by a scooter - bound woman who mistakes his genuine attempts to return an unwanted air fryer to during a riot as looting , follows an insane to attend the funeral of his idol , and and get lost in a mall seemingly inhabited by all of their ex - partners , forcing them into increasingly cringey small talk . Later episodes feature undertaking of the most elaborate and expensive petty revenge schemes in human history , Al being sucked into the terrifying world of managing young white rappers and getting stuck on a filming lot by a deranged showrunner   ( any similarities to real - life figures , of course , coincidental ) .Compared to the third season \\'s anthology episodes unrelated to the main premise , this episode throws up , creating a fictitious alternate history where a junior animator is accidentally promoted to the CEO of in   and sets about making \" the blackest movie of all time , \" which turns out to be the underrated animated masterpiece A Goofy Movie . Presented as a mockumentary with talking heads   ( a mixture of real - life figures and fictional staff )   and an undetectable dividing line between comedy and pathos , the episode is both hilarious and heartbreaking . It \\'s also remarkable to see   ( via )   bankrolling and then showing something so critical of . The show ends , not with a bang or some kind of major climactic event   ( despite teasing leaving the gang for all season ) , but instead a pretty ordinary day for the team , \" ordinary \" doing some heavy lifting as a concept there . The gang are stuck in a posh restaurant with arty food but are distracted by the proximity of a popular chicken fast food joint , whilst undergoes a self - imposed existential crisis which can only be remedied by determining the dimensions of Judge \\'s posterior . Obviously . \\'s final season   ( * * * * * )   is a well - deserved victory lap , the creators taking everything they \\'ve done so far and assembling a final episodes which are as inventive , bizarre and amusing as anything they \\'ve done to date . They do n\\'t go quite as random as the third season , but still keep up the consistency to a very high level . Walking away after such a run of episodes seems both crazy but also so . We need more shows which are as fearless and unbound as this one   ( only channel - mate seems to be willing to go as far at the moment ) , but at least we have the episodes of this show to fall back on in the future . It \\'s been a ride . The entire run of is available on in and in most of the rest of the world . Thank you for reading .

Conflict between the nations appears inevitable , and has never been more vulnerable . \\'s was a breakout , smash success for the Marvel Cinematic Universe . Excellent performances and direction overcame traditional issues   ( a weak finale , overreliant on CGI battles )   to deliver one of the strongest films in the series . The continuation of some of these storylines through : Infinity War and Endgame confirmed there was a great deal of potential in the continued adventures of and the . Unfortunately , unexpectedly passed away from cancer in late . The lost of of his generation \\'s most promising actors was a tragedy . It also - and far more trivially , of course -   created a major problem for , as they spent weeks agonising over whether recasting the role   ( an idea supported by some of \\'s family )   or proceeding in a different direction . Ultimately concluding that was irreplaceable , the decision was made to mirror his passing in the film series , and make the sequel about a completely different story , more about itself and the quest to find a new . It \\'s therefore hard to undersell the conditions under which : was written , shot and released . \\'s shadow hangs over every second of footage and I can only imagine the sheer difficulties faced by director and his team as they tried to course - correct in the most unpleasant of circumstances . Unfortunately , those difficulties are discernible across most of the film . The general story arc feels a little muddled , as it wanders back and forth between internal problems , issues with its relationship with the   ( there \\'s a subplot about tensions in the which feels detached from everything else )   and , slightly randomly , , and the rising challenge posed by   ( a grumpily on - form )   and . There \\'s also the problems faced by   ( an imperiously impressive )   in retaining authority . The film also ill - advisedly decides to do some setup work for later projects by also introducing as   ( aka )   and furthering the machinations of Valentina Allegra de Fontaine   ( ) , which feels like the movie was putting more weight on its shoulders than it could really manage . The film \\'s biggest challenge is elevating as to the role of the main protagonist . was superb in a supporting role in and the duology , but here the writing does n\\'t seem to be up to the task . The film tries to mine some tension over whether is going to become the new , which is pretty much obvious from before you even start watching , and then over whether this would be accepted by other and so on , none of which manages to be particularly interesting . Better - handled is the personal relationship between and , which moves from respect to enmity and back again . The film \\'s problem is that everyone knows that   ( aka )   is one of \\'s longest - standing heroes , so he is clearly going to do a heel turn to becoming a good character at some point . This removes some tension and jeopardy , and the attempts to reinstate it   ( such as a fairly brutal attack on \\'s capital )   only makes \\'s character arc less plausible . The idea is fine but I \\'m not sure I really buy how it unfolds . The movie even manages to fumble its naval battle ending , with some of the worst CGI I \\'ve ever seen in a professionally - made modern feature film . The last time I saw CG this bad in a major release was in , a film now twenty - two years old , and hints at a horrendously rushed production schedule . Again , it \\'s easy to forgive :   ( * * * )   for some of these problems given the huge cloud under which it was made . It has many great performances   ( with having the finest , and Lupita Nyong\\'o and being great in reduced roles ) , many of the ideas are excellent and the notion of making a film where the central character passed away before it even begins is powerful . But the writing is confused , the pacing is uneven , character motivations are not always clear and the effects are risible . The result is a film that is enjoyable , but you have to overlook a lot of issues along the way . The film is available now via Disney+ worldwide . Thank you for reading .

A group of workers on the prison colony discover an abandoned spacecraft , the key to their escape . However , the starship is what the prison colony overseer was looking for , sparking a major pursuit operation . Dal , Gwyn , , , Zero and learn that they are the new owners of the starship USS Protostar , a vessel equipped with an experimental drive system . Advised by an emergency advisory hologram , taking the former of Captain , the reluctant crew have to find a way of getting the home and avoiding their relentless pursuers . Star Trek : Prodigy is the animated show , but the primarily aimed at younger viewers . A co - project between and , the show assembles a crew of alien youngsters to tell a story that , especially in the early going , feels completely disconnected from existing settings and worldbuilding . Indeed , this is the show not to feature a single human regular castmember   ( Janeway being a hologram ) .The season is   episodes long , which is something of a relief in this age of   and -episode seasons that all too often sacrifice character development and standalone side - stories for a central arc   ( often one not remotely worthy of that number of episodes ) . This allows the show to be a bit of a slow burn as it establishes who the characters are and the problems they are facing before it punches the \" story arc \" button . Once it does , that arc unfolds with impressive skill , mixing both the modern - day plot of the characters trying to take their ship home from with an elaborate backstory revolving around the villainous   ( a superb performance by Fringe and Lord of the \\' ) .The main cast are excellent , with adding to a powerfully impressive recent resume of roles   ( , and the upcoming Fallout )   with her role as the conflicted . Comic lunatic   ( , , Paper Girls )   also imbues both with expected comedy and less - expected tragic pathos . The show \\'s real strength is taking ethos of peaceful cooperation and making it work without a lot of baggage . Whilst Picard and Lower Decks have mined a great deal of their stories and setup from earlier shows , Prodigy goes in the opposite direction of keeping the universe at arm \\'s length its early going . is a but has little knowledge of his homeworld or culture , whilst is an incorporeal   ( who briefly show up in ) , but both are deep cuts to a casual viewer . Janeway is obviously a more familiar reference point , but as a hologram limited by her programming rather than the \" real \" Janeway , she is not quite the character we remember . Most of the aliens , worlds , technology and ideas the crew encounter are new and fresh , which is a genuinely impressive feat for what is the television series to bear the name . After , the show is more comfortable embracing its place in the Star Trek universe and the show \\'s integration with more familiar settings and ideas is well - handled . Particularly successful is how the show creates a situation where our heroes simply ca n\\'t immediately join forces with the and instead have to search for a sneaky way of getting the back to without causing a major galactic incident in the process . The season final wraps up this initial story arc with tremendous success , resulting in what might of single finest debut seasons . The show is not without weaknesses , however . Much of the final arc revolves around the dangers of which , although timely , is a story idea done to death in previous shows and only recently the major focus of both a full season of and another full season of Picard . It could also be argued that central character Dal is a bit too standard a protagonist for an animated show , being snarky but resourceful , hot - headed but kind etc . He improves a lot in the latter part of the season which his quest to understand his origins becomes more pressing . The animation is also mostly good , but perhaps a little bit of a step below shows . There is much to enjoy in the debut season of * * * * ) , enough to appeal to both established fans and young children looking for a fun show . A and final season is in production . The show is still available on in many countries , but in some territories it has been removed pending a move to a new station . DVD and sets of the first season are available   ( or will be soon ) .Thank you for reading .
