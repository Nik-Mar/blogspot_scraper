[{"title": "Wasteland: A Heap of Broken Images, Where the Sun Beats", "date": "Tuesday, November 8, 2011", "text": "So this is where all the cars went!My next clue for anything specific to do was in Las Vegas, but first I decided to check out the two other towns I hadn't visited yet: Savage Village and Darwin Village. I went to Savage  Village first, because I had some clue from Needles about rescuing  someone named Redhawk. I never found him or her, but REDHAWK turned out to be the password that got me in the front gate.Unfortunately, I probably screwed things up  after that. The inhabitants asked if I would drop my weapons, and when I  refused, they attacked me. If you thought I felt bad about killing the boy in Highpool, grief-stricken over the death of his dog, imagine what this did to me:In the comments a couple of days ago, we were idly discussing how rare it is that games let you kill children. Part of the reason, of course, is to protect against societal outrage, but probably an equally-important consideration is that it's just screwed up. You play games to escape this kind of realism. My party of rangers just wants to help people, and now we're massacring an entire compound of civilians just because we didn't trust them enough to drop our weapons.The village seems to be led by some guy named the Junk Master, who wants some kind of gift to let me approach him. I don't know what he's looking for (the broken toaster didn't work), so I left after looting some of the buildings.Healing two poisoned souls in Darwin Village.Darwin Village is fairly small. It has a library, a shop, and a mysterious building where someone asks for a password and won't let me in. There was a bar in which none of the keywords I could think of would get anything out of the bartender. In a room in the back of the bar, I found two men who were so sick that just looking at them increased Stetson's \"doctor\" skill. In another building, I found a lab and the game helpfully told me I could use it to make an antitoxin with fruit and chemicals, both of which I happened to have. I healed the two men--Mad Dog Fargo and Metal Maniac--and welcomed them to my party. They both have pretty good skills.I'm glad it gave me this hint, because I never would have though to make antitoxins out of chemicals and fruit. Gummy bears, maybe.I got so overloaded with equipment that I ended up selling a bunch of stuff--possible quest items, grenades, excess ammo--to the shop in Quartz. I've noted that when you sell things to a shop, those things remain available for re-purchase in the shops' inventory, so I'm essentially using the shop as storage--expensive storage, since the shops buy items for half of the cost they sell them. (I'm a little confused as to why cash has any value in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but there you have it.) I keep meaning to check out the flamethrower, but I've been hoping to just find one.One of my NPCs, whom I had equipped with a submachine gun, kept wasting ammo, so I took it away from him. In combat, you choose who to target, and if you have a submachine gun or an automatic weapon, you choose whether to expend a single shot, fire off a burst of three shots, or empty the clip into the bastards. To conserve ammo, I've been limiting myself to bursts, but NPCs decide for themselves who to target and how to shoot. Mort kept wasting entire clips. I ended up dumping him and one of the other NPCs in favor of the two I picked up in Darwin anyway.I should have mentioned it earlier, but different weapons use different ammunition. There are three types of ammo: 9mm, 45 caliber, and 7.62 mm. Each type has uses in multiple weapons. The pistols are easy to figure out because they're called things like \"VP91Z 9mm pistol,\" but it took me some time to figure out which ammo the \"Uzi SMG Mark 27\" submachine gun and the \"M1989A1 Nato assault rifle\" used (9mm and 7.62mm). I question whether the same cartridges could really be used in a 9mm pistol and an Uzi, but there you have it. Anyway, I'm limiting NPCs to melee weapons and clip pistols. I don't know  for sure if ammo ever runs out, but I don't want to tempt fate by  wasting entire clips on rats.Not even radioactive ones.Frankly, I'm wasting enough clips on my own, first by accidentally hitting \"auto\" when running through my attack options, and second because of  a weird bug in trading. If your character has a weapon that uses a particular bit of ammunition and you \"activate\" that ammo in his inventory, it asks whether you want to reload (thus wasting anything left in your active clip) and offers a \"Y/N\" response. But if you say anything other than \"N,\" it assumes \"Y.\" This is a problem when I want to trade the clip from one character to another. I select the ammo and, anticipating that it's next going to ask me what I want to do with it, I hit \"T\" for trade--only to realize that it was asking whether I want to reload instead. Not a great interface design.Mad Dog has some pretty good talents. I need someone with strong anti-tank weapon skills to use all these LAW rockets I've collected.On the skills, I'm beginning to wonder what some of them do. So far, I've found no use for electronics, safecrack, cryptology, silent movement, confidence, sleight-of-hand, forgery, alarm disarm, bureaucracy, or metallurgy. One possibility is that they're just useless; one is that I haven't encountered places to use them yet (though I've only got one city left); one is that they're somehow helping me behind the scenes; and one is that there have been places to use them, but I haven't realized it. I have used acrobat once, to entertain some bar patrons so they would let me off the stage. I'm not 100% sure if \"doctor\" replaces \"medic\"; it sure seems to. \"Bomb disarm\" continues to be very useful:As I said, unless I've missed something, Las Vegas is the last town. I got my ass handed to me last time I visited, but I didn't have automatic weapons and LAW rockets back then. I'll report how I do next time.The funny thing is that I have literally no idea how far along I am in this game. Clearly, there's stuff left to do in Darwin Village and Savage Village, and I still have Vegas to explore, but I don't know if I'll find the final quests among these cities or if the game will suddenly open up a whole new map area or something.This got me thinking about how I generally know my overall progress in other games, whether I've played them before or not. There are several methods, I guess, that always operated unconsciously:1. Sometimes the manual will have tables with character levels, indicating the highest level. Pool of Radiance is one of these. You usually know you're close to the end when characters start maxing their levels. (Wasteland has ranks--my highest ranked character is a \"command corporal\"--but I don't know what the maximum ranks are.)2. Some games are very transparent about the number of levels or areas you have to explore. Wizardry announces right at the beginning that there are 10 levels to the dungeon. Might & Magic has a very clear map with a defined number of areas.3. Sometimes, the main quest makes it clear. DragonAge: Origins had several obvious steps along the main quest that you have to complete before getting to the end game.Occasionally, I've been surprised by long final chapters or codas (e.g., in Baldur's Gate II, I rather expected the final battle to occur with Irenicus at the tree; I didn't expect the subsequent descent into Hell), but rarely has a game come along and utterly mystified me as to my overall progress. Morrowind and Oblivion are two of them; both feature huge game worlds, and  you have no idea how much of that territory the main quest is going to use until you complete it. I remember playing the first Neverwinter Nights and thinking that the city of Neverwinter was the entire game, and that once I collected the bits of the four creatures, the game would be over (it wasn't even close).Wasteland joins this list, and I'm not even sure I want any hints about how close I am to the end. All I can tell you is my next post will be about Las Vegas.Later edit: Just realized I completely forgot about the Guardian's compound where the nuns were shooting at me. I guess this might be the final area. We'll see."}, {"title": "Wasteland: Restless Nights in One-Night Cheap Hotels", "date": "Sunday, November 6, 2011", "text": "Just like my first time in real life!Just a couple days ago, I was noting that Wasteland declined to become the first CRPG to offer a sexual encounter by having my tryst with the barmaid turn into a quest-based conversation with her wheelchair-bound daughter. But then, in Needles, I ran into a three-legged prostitute (Total Recall did the mutation thing a wee bit better) and took her up on her offer. So I am pleased, after all, to report that Wasteland is the first CRPG to offer up sex.Unfortunately, it also turns out to be the first CRPG to offer up a sexually-transmitted disease:I don't want a doctor with a smock like that treating me for V.D.The good news is that the post-apocalyptic, radiation-poisoned, violence-ridden world of Wasteland, unlike the modern world, has a cure for herpes.Let's back up a bit. When I last blogged, I had prematurely entered Las Vegas and, as I alluded at the end of that posting, it wasn't fun. I got assailed by legions of tanks and robotic warriors and had to flee the city. I wasn't expecting robots. Who's controlling them? Skynet?I was ready for this neither thematically nor tactically.It turns out I was in the wrong city anyway. Earlier in the game, I had hopped into a jeep with Ace and took off for Vegas. When the jeep broke down and we ended up in a garage, I somehow had the idea that I was in Vegas. I left the city to go buy a new engine from the Rail Nomads and returned to Vegas only to have the robots chase me out. A little while later, I discovered that the garage wasn't in Vegas to begin with; it was in Needles. That worked out well, since samtam90 told me that's where I probably should be anyway.Don't ignore your Geiger Counter.I spent most of the day solving the quests in Needles, and after it all, I'm still not quite sure what happened. When I arrived in town, there was a lot of talk about murders going on, and it had something to do with a missing \"Bloodstaff\" from the Temple of the Mushroom Cloud. There were several sub-areas to explore in Needles, including a downtown inset, a police station, an ammo dump, and a waste pit. I decided to do the latter first, using TNT to blow up sealed doors. Everything was going well until I forgot to watch my Geiger Counter and accidentally stood on a barrel of radioactive waste. Most of my characters were rendered irradiated and unconscious, and Mayor Pedro and his wife were killed before I could get to an infirmary. I kept their corpses for a while because I didn't want to redistribute their goods, but eventually I replaced them with new NPCs I picked up in the city. I paid $10 for \"bitter piss-water\"?!The Temple of Blood, where I massacred a cult and retrieved the Bloodstaff, was quite difficult. First, I had to get by a bunch of random encounters with mechanized killers. Several times, I was forced to retreat outside the compound to rest and heal. Then there was some kind of puzzle that required me to navigate a chess board via a \"sacred path.\" If there was a hint about the nature of the sacred path, I missed it, so I crossed it through trial and error, taking significant damage along the way.After the chessboard, I was dumped into this underground lake, and my characters took damage swimming through it and from the snipers in the corners of the cult compound. Ultimately, though, I was victorious, retrieved the staff, and exited through a hollow, decommissioned missile.Oh, yeah, and I freed some guy in the missile, but I'm not really sure how or why.I was confused about a lot of what happened, but ultimately the priest of the Mushroom Cloud temple thanked me for the return of his staff and gave me a nice reward.I guess this is a broad hint that I should go to Las Vegas next.Throughout all of this, I was referred constantly to adventurer's journal entries. This was a memorable one from a torture chamber in the Temple of Blood. I got it just before I rescued a prisoner, a hobo named Ralf, who became one of my NPCs:The glowing torchlight flickers across a horrific scene. Men in torn and blood spattered robes struggle against the ropes binding them to massive steel tables. The tables slope down at the head and a catch basin at the lowest corner is used to collect the dark flow of blood dripping from the small wounds cut into each writhing victim. Priests rush from one table to another, gathering buckets the way a dairy farmer gathers the bucket of milk from his cows. They pour the smaller quantities of blood into a hole in the floor, but you cannot tell where the dark fluid drains away to in this dim chamber of horrors.Some other miscellaneous notes:I left a few mysteries in Needles. One was a train that just goes back  and forth on its track for no obvious purpose. Another was a howitzer,  for which I have shells but no particular reason to fire it in any of  the directions it offers.This would have been more useful if could have blown up the Temple of Blood with it.I keep accidentally running into cacti, which cause several points of damage per character.There were some hills in the southern part of town that increased my climbing skill when I trundled over them. At the top of one was some kind of quest-related note for the Savage Village. Glad I took that effort. It makes me wonder what else I've missed by not stepping on every single square of the game.There was a library in town that allowed me to spend my accumulated skill points. Two of my characters were smart enough for the \"doctor\" skill, which I guess is a more advanced version of \"medic.\" One of the skills offered was \"toaster repair.\" Is this a joke, or does it really come in handy somewhere?A hot dog stand had some really disgusting offerings. The post-apocalyptic world of Wasteland has apparently resorted to cannibalism.The police station had a bunch of robotic police officers that were not happy with my picking the lock to their storage room. Gunning them down didn't seem to bother anyone else at the station, though.I've finally given up on the \"melee-only\" thing. Too many enemies attack from a range. All my characters have sub-machine guns or automatic rifles now. Right now, I have plenty of ammo, but I wonder how long that will hold, especially with the ability to fire off an entire clip at once (when you shoot a gun, you have options for \"single,\" \"burst,\" or \"automatic\" modes).Finding places to use skills, attributes, and items has become second-nature to me. At the beginning of the game, I thought this system would drive me crazy, but it's not as hard as I thought. Every time you get some interesting message about the environment (e.g., \"you're standing next to a jumbled bookcase\"), you try your perception skill. If there's a trap or bomb, you attempt disarm. Locked doors give way to picklock, strength, or (as a last resort) demolitions.Disarming a trap.But I could be missing out on a lot. I haven't found any way to directly use dexterity, intelligence, or any of the attributes other than strength, for instance. Someone clue me in if these play a big role.My next stops will be Savage Village and then I guess I'll have another try at Las Vegas, although there's still that Darwin Village off to the east. I'll try to write some more about combat next time."}, {"title": "Wasteland: Breeding Lilacs out of the Dead Land", "date": "Saturday, November 5, 2011", "text": "This is the death screen.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Not knowing exactly where to go next, I decided to take stock of my options and explore the outdoor map. I was surprised to find it so small: only 62 x 62 squares. Beyond them is a message that you're facing \"miles and miles of endless wasteland,\" which is game's not-so-subtle way of not allowing you to trek all the way to Seattle.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I found only six towns, caves, and keeps that I hadn't already explored: a mine shaft, Savage Village, Needles, Las Vegas, Darwin Village, and the Guardian's Citadel. Darwin Village, on the east side of the map, is surrounded by radioactive ground. I was puzzled at first because I wasn't seeing the little \"radioactive\" symbols on the ground, but my Geiger Counter was going nuts. It turns out you can only see them at night.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Because the ground gives off a radioactive glow?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A river flows through the middle of the map, ending in a lake at the south-central portion. Entering the river at any point means taking loads of damage as you're carried helplessly downstream before (randomly, it seems), you finally wade into some shallows.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Oddly, it doesn't seem to affect any of our equipment.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The map isn't a terrible approximation of the American southwest. Based on the one reference point that I know--Las Vegas--the dangerous river seems to pretty much follow the path of the Colorado River, though ignoring Lake Mead (Hoover Dam was presumably destroyed). The lake corresponds with Lake Mohave on the Arizona/Nevada border. None of the cities make sense, though. Needles, Quartz, and Darwin Village all exist in places where there's absolutely nothing but desert now. And, of course, as you fall into the river in the game, it doesn't bother to mention that you've climbed down to the base of the Grand Canyon. The mountains don't quite match up, either.Oddly, the manual indicates that Ranger Central is at the \"California-Arizona border,\" which would be off by a few hundred miles.The first new place I checked out was the mine shaft south of Quartz. There were a lot of combats there, a few dead miners, but not much else. A few places where the corridor ended and the game told me there were pick marks in the wall. This seemed to be some kind of clue, but nothing I tried--perception, the pick axe--had any effect.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Next, I checked out the Guardian's Citadel. I apparently tried that too soon. My party was wiped out by homicidal nuns and I had to reload.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 How do you solve a problem like Theodosia?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 By this time, some commenter with a ridiculous alphanumeric name gave me a hint about Head Crusher. I returned to him and, in the spirit of the comment, sat down across from him. Still nothing. After screwing around with different options, I finally got him to talk to me by using the visa card on myself, which makes no sense but whatever. He told me to use the Password CATERPILLAR at \"Atchison's tent.\"Returning to the Rail Nomads' camp, I talked to the hobo again. For every bottle of liquor I gave him, he gave me a cryptic hint:\"Beware the man who has lived longer than the wasteland.\"\"Those who guard the past guard the secret to immortality.\"\"Trust the one born beneath the battlefield.\"\"Man before wife, save a life.\"\"A body is only a box to keep your mind in.\"\"A steel storm threatens the City of Cold.\"\"To the mother who speaks riddles comes a child of promise. Aid her and aid justice.\"\"One man's dream is another's nightmare, but a machine's dream is everyone's nightmare.\"\"Twins born by the same hands are twins no more. Wake the sleeper to cure the sick.\"\"Destroy the wombs and destroy the threat.\"Then he passed out and said no more. I couldn't find any relevance to quests I've already solved, except maybe the mother/daughter one, which might refer to Ellen and Laurie.Head Crusher had told me to go to the \"Atchison\" tent. There are three tents in the Rail Nomads' camp, and I reasoned that the Atchison was probably the first one (the other two likely being the Topeka and the Santa Fe). I was correct. For my trouble, the headman of the clan gave me a shovel and told me to dig at a particular spot. I did and found a reasonably good cache of treasure, including 4 grenades. I really have to start using those. Then, a bunch of rail thieves jumped out and attacked me.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Based on Samtam90's comment yesterday, I returned to Quartz, searched Ugly John's hideout more thoroughly and found a trap door I had missed before. Beneath it was a dungeon with Ace, who joined my party after I dumped Dan Citrine. Ace indicated there was some kind of war going on in Las Vegas and wanted to recruit me to assist.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Ace is skilled with rifles, so finally I can get rid of some of those 7.62mm clips that have been piling up. I bought him an M19 carbine and loaded him up with ammo. I should also mention that I broke my melee-only vow so that Stetson could try out an Uzi (which uses 9mm ammo--also in plentiful supply) I admit it's been working fairly well, so I guess I'll have him hold on to it. My other two NPCs are using handguns but I think I'll keep my other three PCs with axes for now.I guess my next stop is Vegas. I might finally get to use my \"gambling\" skill there, though money hasn't exactly been in short supply yet. I have over $5000. As I left Quartz with Ace, he \"fixed the jeep\" and we rocketed to Vegas, only to have the car break down when we got there. A mechanic told me he could fix it if I got a new engine. I left the mechanic's shop and soon found that an engine for a jeep was the least of my problems."}, {"title": "Wasteland: I Will Show You Fear in a Handful of Dust", "date": "Friday, November 4, 2011", "text": "Can't we all just get along?Here I am in this post-apocalyptic wasteland, and you'd think that the few survivors of the nuclear fallout might be eager to get along, to rebuild society. Instead, they've mostly descended into cliches: gunmen, bikers, and vagrants, all eager to kill anyone with anything remotely valuable. In my visit to the town of Quartz, I utterly depopulated the place.Before that, though, I managed to get all of my characters radiation-poisoned. Here's a tip, kids: When wandering through the desert, if you see a bunch of radiation symbols everywhere, don't walk on them.\"The ground seems to glow here\" was another clue.Radiation poisoning keeps your characters from regenerating hit points, and from ever waking up if they're unconscious. The manual says that in such circumstances, one should \"get medical help as soon as you can,\" but I had no idea where to find any. My \"medic\" skills did nothing. Bit-by-bit, enemies chipped away at my remaining hit points and wiped out my party. I had to restore the backup I made of my character files just after character creation.Then I found an infirmary in Highpool. Aargh.Retracing my steps again wasn't so bad, for two reasons: Jackie lived this time, and I managed to find a cave I had previously overlooked in the agricultural centerAlso, this time around, I decided to sell the fruit I had collected in the agricultural center (I have no idea what it does), which gave me enough money to buy the engine from the Nomad's Camp and thus save Highpool.Their thanks was accompanied by cash and goods worth more than the $500 engine, too.After retracing my previous steps through the Rail Nomads' camp, I headed off to find the city of Quartz to give the brakeman's visa to Head Crusher. The city turned out to be on the other side of some mountains. Outside, there was this broken-down jeep, but I couldn't figure out any way to repair it. Maybe that comes later. It is funny that the game highlights this one jeep, though; wouldn't there be broken-down cars everywhere? If not, what happened to them?There's no \"mechanic\" skill.In Quartz, I found a ton of abandoned buildings like this, with nothing in them:But there was also a lot of adventure in the city. There was a store that finally bought all of my unwanted guns and ammo. There, I bought axes for my characters, TNT for my demolitions expert, and a Geiger counter (I just figure it will come in handy).It was in the bar that things really took off. There were a couple of role-playing encounters like this:I went with \"chill out\" but ended up having to kill them all anyway.Walking through the patrons, I started to hear rumors about \"Ugly's gang,\" which was apparently holding the town's mayor hostage in the courthouse.This latter bit of intel came from a teenager who I saved from being raped in the men's room.The kid also told me of a bar patron named the Riddler. The Riddler asked me three riddles. The first, I got wrong, which annoyed me because I'm usually pretty good at that. See what you would answer:After rejecting GRAPES, I went with MILK, thinking that for breakfast you \"eat\" milk, along with cereal, with a spoon, then drink it for dinner. It was wrong. He wouldn't give me another chance at it, so I didn't feel bad Googling it to sate my curiosity. TOAST was the answer. Dammit.The second riddle, I got; something like, \"It's in the middle of America and Australia\" (R). But for the third, he asked me how I could compliment the waitress, Ellen, in 8 letters or less. I didn't know, but the bartender (whom I had to split my party to talk to, because only one character could belly up to the bar at a time), for $10, told me to check the graffiti on one of the tables. I had been writing the graffiti down, and I assumed that the words (URABUTLN, UQTU) were codes of some kind. But it turns out they're meant to be read phonetically (\"You are a beauty, Ellen\"; \"You cutie, you\"). With the former, I charmed the waitress and got from her a key to her room at the local inn.Heading over there expecting some action, I was instead surprised to find her wheelchair-bound daughter, Laurie, who reiterated the plight of the hostages in the courthouse. She gave me some grenades and the password (MUERTE) and wished me luck. That's nice and all, but I was looking forward to citing Wasteland as the first CRPG sex. I guess that will have to wait.Over a couple of hours, I stormed the courthouse and rescued Mayor Pedros and a guy named Dan Citrine. The battles were tough, pitting my axe-wielding rangers against armed gunmen who started shooting while I was some distance away. If you have melee weapons and your enemies have ranged weapons, you have to charge through a hail of bullets to get into melee range. Fortunately, hit points regenerate quickly in the wilderness areas, so I just kept leaving town and waiting to recharge.Closing the distance between armed enemies in combat.In the courthouse, I found a clue as to the password to Ugly John's hideout and stormed that, too. After a bunch of combats, I ran into Ugly John himself, who had fastened a bomb to Mayor Pedros's wife, Felicia, and was willing to give me the code for his life. It was interesting role-playing decision, but I decided to kill Ugly John and trust my own \"disarm\" skill to deal with the bomb. Fortunately, it worked, and Felicia became my third (and final) NPC. Pedros, Dan, and Felicia all prefer small arms, so I'll humor them and see how I like it.This could have gone badly but didn't.It sounds like a reasonably successful play session, but throughout it, I collected a series of mysteries that I wouldn't mind a hint or two (if you don't know the difference between a hint and a spoiler, please refrain from commenting) to solve.1. I went to the town in the first place to give the visa card to Head Crusher. I found Head Crusher in the bar, but he won't talk to me and \"using\" the visa card on him doesn't do anything.2. The bartender told me that a guy named Ace wants some help dealing with problems in Las Vegas. But I can't find Ace anywhere I look. (Maybe he's in another town.)3. I keep loading up on items that don't seem to serve any purpose. Ropes and canteens I've figured out, but what do I do with maps, clay pots, jugs, jewelry, books, matches, fruit, and hand mirrors? I've been holding on to a few of each and selling the rest.I've bought pick ax and a gas mask just in case, but what is everything else for?4. I've risen a few levels; a couple of my characters are Senior Specialists now. Each level up allows you to allocate a couple new points to your attributes. But how do you raise your skills? I've actually discovered that some skills increase by using them; my perception and climb abilities have both gone up this way. But my pugilism and brawling haven't budged despite using them extensively, and neither has lockpick. I've got a handful of skill points to spend, too.My climbing skill increases as I climb a fence in the middle of combat.Despite these mysteries, I've become a lot more comfortable with Wasteland and I feel like I'm in the groove now. One thing I like about the game is how you can use multiple means to accomplish the same things. Faced with a locked door, you can try to pick it, force it open with your strength, blow it up with TNT, pry it with a crowbar, or (in some cases) get the key from an NPC. When I needed to enter Ugly John's hideout, I could have fought my way through the front door, delivered one of two passwords (found at different places in the town), or sneaked in through a secret entrance and down a skylight. Even solving the riddles and meeting Laurie wasn't technically necessary to solve the quest, although it did make it easier and more fun.Without knowing how to deal with Head Crusher or find Ace, though, I'm a bit adrift at this point, so I'm going to randomly explore some towns and such and see how it goes.One final note: In Quartz, I explored a graveyard and was attacked by undead! Way to mix genres, Wasteland!It's not just an apocalypse...it's a zombie apocalypse!"}, {"title": "Wasteland: Dry Bones Can Harm No One", "date": "Thursday, November 3, 2011", "text": "I realize that there was no Internet in 1988, but couldn't the creators have bothered to research what an opossum actually looks like?\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Brandon Sanderson had an interesting posting on the Tor/Forge blog a couple of days ago about the use of guns in fantasy. He reconciles his youthful belief that \"if it has guns, it's not good fantasy\" with the fact that he's included guns--\"lots of guns\"--in the post-industrial-revolution Mistborn: The Alloy of Law. He ultimately decides that it's the magic, not the technology, that makes the fantasy.His post got me wondering, though, if whether my aversion to post-apocalyptic CRPGs isn't so much about the post-apocalypse as the guns. I've never been much of a gun guy. I was in a branch of the armed forces when I was younger, so I'm not afraid of them or anything, but I never found them particularly fascinating, and I never learned more about them than what I needed to learn to get through my enlistment. I can field-strip an M16, and I can tell you the difference between an M16A1 and an M16A2, and that's about it.In reflection, the part I liked least about both Sentinel Worlds and Star Command was trying to figure out which guns I should arm my characters with. I'm having the same issue in Wasteland. I know what a LAW rocket does because I blew up a dumpster with one (for god's sake, make sure you yell \"backblast area all clear!\" before firing it, or you'll be doing pushups all weekend), but I have no idea how to choose between an AK-97 or a M1989A1 NATO assault rifle, and I really don't care.So I've decided that my new Wasteland party is going to be hardcore--melee weapons all the way. If they pick up NPCs who use guns, they can continue to use them, but the core members are going to be like Batman: Everything gets channeled into the skills of pugilism, brawling, and knife fighting.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Guns are for pansies.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Creating a new party turned out to be a little more difficult than I anticipated. As many of you pointed out, Wasteland supports just one save file, which it constantly writes over whether you choose to save or not. Because you informed me about potential bugs associated with this, I've been backing up the file occasionally (I'm only going to access it if the game gets corrupted). But starting over completely requires deleting the file and then re-installing the original.I rolled four new characters, focusing on high IQs, dexterity, agility, and strength. I spent a long time on this. There are some games in which the total number of points for all attributes is relatively fixed, so that if you get an 18 score for strength, you're unlikely to get a similarly high score in other attributes. Not so with Wasteland: Each attribute is mutually exclusive of the others, meaning it's theoretically possible to roll 18s in everything given enough time. I kept hitting \"roll again\" until I had four characters with at least 15 in the core attributes and at least 10 in everything else. When I say this took a \"long\" time, I mean I listened to almost the entire Smithsonian jazz anthology (I'm linking to it because it's an awesome buy) in the meantime.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These stats took about 250 re-rolls to achieve.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Now, on this subject: Has this ever happened to you? You're hitting the \"re-roll\" key over and over, trying to get that perfect set of stats, but you end up falling into a rhythm, and you accidentally hit the key a nanosecond before you realize the perfect set of stats was just right there in front of you. That must have happened to me 50 times.Eventually, though, I had my party. And within short order, I had caught up to where I was when I decided to re-start: I went to the village of Highpool, looted the shopkeeper's bedroom, got the clues, found a building in which a pump needed to be fixed (my perception skill suggests that it needs a new engine), entered the cave, killed Bobby's rabid dog (I couldn't think of any way to get past him to rescue Jackie otherwise), and exited. After I left the cave and was attacked by the grief-stricken Bobby, I realized that it's quite easy to run away from combat. I was able to skirt the boy and get out of town without killing him.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A key early quest.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Heading away from Highpool, I found an \"agricultural center,\" in which I discovered a bunch of farmers shaking their heads with despair. Here, I got my first reference to the adventurer's journal. Much like Pool of Radiance, Wasteland frequently refers you to a journal to read long descriptive paragraphs.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My first chance to be a hero!This one went:Closer now, you can hear the conversation of the men you saw when you came in. There is a short silence after each man voices his thoughts. They speak of varmints who are impossible to kill. The varmints are stealing their food faster than ever before and they seem to be massing for a major attack. The simple weapons of the  farmers are not enough to stop them. They have no idea what to do.  One of them jumps as he notices you and they all turn to face you. A stocky man they call Miguel approaches.I agreed to help them and faced a succession of giant rabbits, moles, and other murderous furry creatures, culminating in a battle against Harry, the Bunny Master. Unfortunately, he killed Jackie, the NPC companion I had just picked up. I hope I don't need her.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This was a bit goofy.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The game's diabolical AI seems to lead enemies to focus on characters with low hit points. As soon as one of my party members starts to dip a bit, he or she becomes the target of everyone's attacks. If the character's hit points reach 0, he falls unconscious. Less than 0, he becomes seriously wounded. Unconscious characters regenerate hit points as time passes and wake up, but seriously wounded characters get worse as time passes, progressing to critically wounded, mortally wounded, comatose, and finally dead. The \"medic\" skill can reverse the process, but I only gave my characters level 1 in the skill, and apparently you need a higher level to turn someone from \"critical\" (which Jackie was) to just \"unconscious.\" Looks like I need to invest more in medical skills.Aside from that, the all-melee party has worked out reasonably well. After my foray in the agricultural station, most of my characters raised to Level 2. You increase in levels by \"radioing\" back to Ranger Central for a promotion. One character remains stubbornly at Level 1 because the party gets experience from individual kills in battle instead of party experience. In this, the game is more like Ultima V than The Bard's Tale.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 From my time in the armed forces, I learned that rarely do four privates go out on missions without any kind of NCO. The rangers must be seriously understaffed.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I explored a little of the outdoor areas and found the functional edge of the map. I also kept getting notices that it was getting hotter, but I'm not sure what effect that had on my party.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I bypassed something called the \"Guardian's Citadel\" and instead headed for the Rail Nomads' Camp because the game manual listed it as the third place I should try. The camp is a train yard whose denizens live in the rusted remains of boxcars and use railroad titles (Engineer, Hobo, Brakeman). The \"Brakeman\" gave me a Visa card to deliver to the \"Head Crusher\" in the town of Quartz. There were three tents I couldn't enter without some kind of password and an Engineer who offered some dialogue options, but only had anything to say about his fellow trainsfolk. A trader in the train sells an engine, which I could use in Highpool, but for $500. I only have $170. Funny how dollars still retain value in this post-apocalyptic world.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 So at this point, I have several options for going forward: Find some folks to fight to earn the rest of the money for the engine (I have a bunch of guns I could sell, but I haven't found anyone to buy them yet), try to find Quartz, or just head out on my own. Whatever I choose, I am starting to get into the game a bit. I like the journal entries, and I'm finally figuring out how to watch the game's notes carefully for indications that I need to use an item, attribute, or skill."}, {"title": "I Can't Get Started with You", "date": "Monday, October 31, 2011", "text": "How do I avoid killing this innocent child?Wasteland seems like a game I could grow to like once I get comfortable with it, but right now I'm in that angst-filled stage of gameplay where I don't know how everything works yet, and every time I leave an area, I feel like I missed something. As much as I like CRPGs, I hate this phase of playing CRPGs--when I'm just on the cusp of familiarity, yet something still seems elusive.Baldur's Gate gave you a nice, relaxing tutorial in which the monks taught you how to use the keyboard.I suspect many other gamers feel similarly, because a somewhat standard feature in modern games is a limited introductory area combined with a tutorial. I don't know what game offered this first, but I first encountered it in Baldur's Gate and it was brilliant. There were a series of simple quests interspersed with characters who tutored you on how to use the interface. By the time you left Candlekeep, you could focus entirely on the story and gameplay. Neverwinter Nights, Oblivion, and Dragon Age: Origins are all recent games with good opening sections that ease you into the game world and interface.The useful Oblivion tutorial.In the pre-tutorial era, CRPGs had several other ways to get you going smoothly. One was by simply not being that hard to begin with. Anyone who sits down with Rogue for 10 minutes and then screams, \"I just can't figure this game out!\" probably shouldn't be at the computer at all. Another was to adopt conventions of other games; a Wizardry player doesn't have much difficulty figuring out The Bard's Tale. Certain series maintained consistency, and of course in the 1990s, you start to see commonalities in games that use the same engine. I don't think Icewind Dale had a tutorial, but most gamers were coming from Baldur's Gate and didn't need it.This is why it can be so comfortable to slip into a D&D-derived game. You may not know the world, the quest, or the characters, but at least you know the rules. I can't remember the last time I fired up a D&D game and said to myself, \"I wonder if the 'fireball' spell is going to be useful.\"Of course, many early game developers relied on manuals to do the work of tutorials, and this is perhaps the least satisfying way to get involved in a game. I love the old game manuals for back story and descriptions of the world--I really need to do a posting on this--but not for descriptions of the interface. There's not much more painful than to read a description of a game screen you haven't even encountered yet.From the Pool of Radiance manual: Each menu command described in detail. Easier just to figure it out while playing.Stephen King has a pretty good passage in Hearts in Atlantis in which an older character is giving advice to a kid about reading.A book is like a pump. It gives nothing unless first you give to it. You prime a pump with your own water, you work the handle with your own strength. You do this because you expect to get back more than you give...eventually.He recommends that the kid read the first 20 pages or something, and if by then it's just not flowing, put it aside and try something else. This was largely the purpose behind my six-hour rule. I figured it would stop me from discarding perfectly good games that just take a while to get into. It has, for the most part. But, for some reason, in 1988, I've been allowing myself the luxury of blowing past games that confound me--BattleTech, Sentinel Worlds, Star Command--with the result that I have a whole list of games I've kicked to the end of the 1988, and I now I have to put in some serious elbow grease.It starts with Wasteland. I haven't played it all month, so I really need to just start over with a brand new set of characters, focus, and devote the time until it starts flowing on its own. I think I'll have enough by tomorrow for at least a short posting. In the meantime, for any of you who recognized the title of this posting from an old Ira Gershwin/Vernon Duke song (it's really worth downloading the Bunny Berigan and Anita O'Day versions), here's a verse I wrote just for you:I've led the arls of Ferelden to warA whole world calls me its avatarWith demon lords I've a-la-cartedStill I can't get started with you"}, {"title": "Game 65: Wasteland (1988)", "date": "Sunday, October 2, 2011", "text": "WastelandUnited StatesInterplay (developer); Electronic Arts (publisher)Released\u00a01988 for Apple II and Commodore 64; 1989 for DOSDate Started: 2 October 2011What is that sound high in the airMurmur of maternal lamentationWho are those hooded hordes swarmingOver endless plains, stumbling in cracked earthRinged by the flat horizon onlyWhat is the city over the mountainsCracks and reforms and bursts in the violet airFalling towersJerusalem Athens AlexandriaVienna LondonUnrealI had little idea what to expect when starting Wasteland, other than dozens of you love the game and have all but threatened me with bodily harm should I not love it myself. As I indicated a few months ago, I'm not a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction, but I can try to suppress that for good gameplay.Having not even looked at a screen shot before yesterday, I was thus rather unprepared to find a strange hybrid between The Bard's Tale (in combat), Ultima IV/V (in dialogue and the top-down perspective), Pool of Radiance (in the use of journal entries), and perhaps Demon's Winter (in the direct application of skills and items). The latter point is something I'll have to cover in more detail below, because it confounded me for a while.But first, the story: The game postulates an escalating arms and space race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union (and their respective allies) between 1987 and 1998. In 1998, just as a new space station was supposed to go online, all of Earth's orbital satellites disappeared, causing the two superpowers to panic and launch \"90 percent of their nuclear arsenals,\" destroying most of civilization.The PCs come from an outpost in the southwestern United States that used to be a federal prison. The small civilization is made up of the remnants of a company of U.S. Army engineers, who were doing some work in the area, and some local \"survivalist communities.\" The nascent civilization established a martial force called the Desert Rangers to make contact with other civilizations and protect the community from assorted marauders, including the convicts whom the Army expelled from the prison.The party consists of up to four player-created characters plus NPCs you can pick up along the way. Character creation was a difficult process for me. There are a standard set of attributes--strength, speed, charisma, IQ, agility, luck, and dexterity (odd to see speed, agility, and dexterity)--rolled randomly from 3 to 18, which is no big deal, but then you select from up to 27 different skills. The game manual indicates that the selection of skills, and the number you could select, are both determined by the IQ score, so for all four characters, I shot for the highest IQ I could.Allotting skills.The problem was in determining what skills to assign. In all games that feature skills, you almost have to play the game once to get a sense of what skills are valuable. Games have a way of making particular skills sound valuable, then pulling the rug out from under you. For instance, Wasteland features a skill called \"acrobat,\" which the game indicates \"can get you out of a tough situation--like leaping off of bar counters while you're surrounded by a hostile crowd.\" This sounds potentially useful, but it may turn out that there are only four situations in the entire game in which you have to leap off a bar counter, and all of them have alternate solutions. There are several others--\"demolition,\" \"forgery,\" \"alarm disarm,\" \"bureaucracy\"--that could either be extraordinarily useful throughout the game or utterly worthless. Only time will tell. I gave everyone at least one combat-oriented skill and made the best guesses I could from there.In character creation, you also get to choose nationalities, including U.S., Russian, Chinese, Indian, and Mexican. I chose one each of everyone but Chinese, wondering at the same time how to explain such a diverse group in the American southwest just before a nuclear war.I started out in Ranger Center--the converted prison--without a lot of clues about what to do. The manual indicates that my team has been \"assigned to investigate a series of disturbances in the desert\" and that I need to check a town called Highpool, an agricultural center, and the camp of the Rail Nomads. At first, I thought the game had started me with no weapons or equipment, and I fought the first few battles with my bare hands, but then I realized I actually had an extensive inventory of pistols, ammunition, and goods.That hand mirror will come in handy.West of the Ranger Center, I found the town of Highpool, which I wandered around for a while. I like how the game's message box changes to tell me a little about the features and buildings I'm passing:This isn't entirely useless information, I don't think, as one of my quests has to do with repairing a pump.Wandering into a shop, I was greeted by a note that seemed to offer a sort of \"quest list\" for Highpool:I wasn't sure what any of the items really meant, but in the southwest corner of town, I ran into a child--Bobby, it turned out--who offered me some hints, when prompted by certain keywords, about these quests.NAME, JOB, and HEALTH don't produce any responses, regrettably.At this point, I got stuck for almost an hour. Bobby had told me that the cave was hidden behind some bushes, but I wandered all over the place and didn't find it. After a long time screwing around, I realized I need to \"use\" my \"perception\" skill to find the cave, but even then it took about 30 minutes of searching every bush in the area. I then had to use a rope to climb down.The game is unique in the way that you can directly employ skills, items, and even attributes through the \"use\" command. In another place, for instance, I found a locked door, but I was able to \"use\" my strength to force it open--I assume I could similarly have used my lock picking skill. Usually, games tell you the scenario and offer you the option of using your various skills; this is the only one I've played that really forces you to pay close attention to your surroundings and figure out what skill works best. In another location, I found a shop that indicated there was gambling going on, but I didn't take the \"gambling\" skill, so I assume that's why I wasn't offered the option to play a game.To interact with some characters, you have to start an \"encounter\" with them. This took me a while to figure out.After that, I really hosed things up. I entered the cave but had to kill Bobby's rabid (or mutated dog). Though I found the missing Jackie (who joined my party), when I exited the cave I was confronted by a heartbroken Bobby, who attacked me and forced me to kill him. I then got into a tussle with a bunch of local kids who laughed at me for falling into a stream and ended up essentially massacring the town. Not a great start. Now that I know a little more about how the game is played, I think I'm going to roll up some more characters and try different skills.Shooting a kid whose dog you killed is not a great start to the adventure.On combat, I will say that it's remarkably like The Bard's Tale II and III, which makes sense, as they are both Interplay games. Enemies start from a distance and you have various options for attacking, evading, and fleeing. After you queue up actions for each character, the game executes them--I think in order of the character's speed.The rabid dog would not let me \"hire\" him.The shops are also very Bard's Tale-ish:$10 for a match. Nuclear apocalypses are really tough on inflation.As I prepare to start over, I am intrigued by the various gameplay elements and innovations, and I'm beginning to see why so many people like it. But there's a lot to get used to. I'm not entirely sure how firearms and ammunition work, for instance, and I don't know how to determine which of my pistols does the most damage. There doesn't seem to be any way that I can find to \"advance\" across a field of combat, so I'm not sure what to do when there are 40 feet between me and the enemy and I only have melee weapons. I'm sure it will sort itself out.In the meantime, I'll be impressed if anyone gets my opening verse without Googling it. I thought it was eerily appropriate."}, {"title": "Game 64: Visions of the Aftermath: The Boomtown (1988)", "date": "Friday, September 30, 2011", "text": "As a CRPG...what?...connoisseur?...I have learned to be wary of games whose manuals oversell themselves. Visions of the Aftermath: The Boomtown promises a game that presents \"the laws of nature in an inter-active environment without seeming arbitrary or trite.\" The game, it goes on, \"is designed to model life,\" with the map \"designed to seem like places instead of squares.\" Through repeated deaths, it promises, \"you are mastering skills which give you unprecedented control of such a reality.\"Moving past the author's self-accolades, we find that Visions is a passable post-apocalyptic simulator, not light years removed from Scavengers of the Mutant World. When you start the game, you set its parameters and difficulty level and then try to achieve your goal while the game concertedly tries to kill you. In most scenarios, the goal is simply to survive a certain number of years.Looks rather homey.The game takes place in 1995, some unspecified time after the bombs fell, and the player begin his life in a bomb shelter with random amounts of food and goods. If playing a game in which all you have to do is survive, there's really no reason to leave the shelter except that the food eventually runs out. Outside the shelter, you have to contend with erratic weather, radiation, scavengers, mutants, dwindling food supplies, and other trappings of post-apocalyptic sci-fi.Lost in the desert.After a few deaths, I won the game rather easily by setting all the parameters to their easiest level and establishing the \"win\" condition as lasting only two years. I was able to spend about 14 months in my initial shelter. Ultimately, I had to leave to find more food, but I just found another shelter close by and spent the next 10 months there. It was something of a hollow victory:Look at the bottom for the \"win\" message. It's all you get from the game.The game is not a CRPG; its inclusion here is another MobyGames errata. It is, nonetheless, mildly interesting, and I can see how things like the health meter and the inventory could confuse someone as to its CRPG creds. Turn-based, it is meant to be played with other players against whom you can compete for the longest life and the highest score.The settings for one Boomtown scenario.In  harder games than the one I won on, you have to engage in a wide spectrum of statistics-studying and planning to survive. You watch the messages carefully so as to avoid going outside during storms. You stock up on fertilizer to grow your own food. You chop down forests for fuel and lumber. You scavenge for car parts so you don't have to walk around and get caught during meteor showers. You build generators to supply electricity. You meet other people and learn their skills. Or kill them and take their stuff. You find books and spend cold winter months reading them in your shelter to gain knowledge.And you can fish!Combat is rather lame, consisting of simply exhausting your supply of arrows at your enemy and hoping that's enough. If not, the game lets you sheepishly trade with your enemies shortly after trying to kill them.Dealing with a horde.Ultimately, it doesn't add up to much. The best way to win--if not get the highest score--is to keep a low profile, remember shelter locations, cache resources, and use the environment. This might make it an interesting simulator, but it doesn't do much for a CRPG addict. So, having won at least one scenario, I'm giving it a ranking of 26 and moving on.I realize that it wasn't much of a return posting after a two-week absence. But I trust you'll enjoy what's coming next: Wasteland!"}, {"title": "Ultima IV, Part 2: What Happend in Between", "date": "Wednesday, September 14, 2011", "text": "I sometimes don't like parodies, but this one wasn't half bad.Reader Eugene Hung told me recently about Ultima IV, Part II: Dude, Where's My Avatar?  and I admit to approaching it with some trepidation. Let it not be said  that the CRPG Addict doesn't have a sense of humor, but I sometimes  don't like parodies. I have never been much of a Monty Python fan, for  instance, and I loathe The Holy Grail. Parodies only work for me when the creator clearly knows and loves the original.I downloaded it and played it without really reading much about it first. It was made with a designing tool called the Adventure Creation Kit, which I originally took to be an early or mid-1990s tool, much like the Adventure Construction Set that I blogged about last year. In fact, to be honest, I originally thought that UIVPII was created with the  Adventure Construction Set, and I was prepared to praise it's original  and detailed use--I couldn't even get Bourbon Street finished.But it turns out, I now see, that developer Chris Hopkins only released the latest version of the Adventure Creation Kit in 2008, and Ultima IV, Part II--its only full game so far--came out in 2009. He purposely designed the Kit to mimic the look of two-dimensional, old-school, tile-based games. In the case of this game, it copies Ultima V textures and icons to tell a story that happens between Ultima IV and Ultima V.My reaction to the story itself, and its humor, is pretty positive--there is no question that Mr. Hopkins knows the Ultima series inside and out--but my reaction to the Adventure Creation Kit is even better. I'd like to see many, many more games using this construction set. It makes attractive maps, supports excellent dialogue and inventory systems, and is very intuitive. Aside from the joke parts of the game, I had a lot of fun exploring the dungeons, fighting monsters, and collecting loot and treasure. Mr. Hopkins really has something here.Note: Since this is a fairly new game, I should note that major spoilers follow!I won the game, and spent enough time doing so for three postings, but I don't want to take that much time for a diversion, so I'll try to describe it all here. My Avatar begins sitting around his house, contemplating Britannia while staring at an odd poster of a pole-dancing centaur.Turning on the television, I find my answer: Mondain, Minax, and Exodus are all on Jerry Springer, complaining about their family problems. The show descends into a brawl, and the three of them end up escaping back to Britannia.You might not see it, but Minax is \"played\" by Tammy Faye Bakker.Shortly after, I get a phone call from the old gypsy, who walks me through the Ultima IV questions--or, at least, a variant thereof (one of the responses is \"whatever lets me use a sword\")--before shipping me to Britannia.Exactly!I find Lord British hiding within his throne room, having blocked the entrance with a chair. He explains that Mondain, Minax, and Exodus have taken over the Lycaeum, Empath Abbey, and Serpent's Hold, and they have corrupted the virtues. He also seems to share some of my disbelief at Ultima II.After getting him to return me to Level 8--which he never does in any other game--and give me his \"Orb of Cheating,\" which despite its name isn't so much different from the Orb of Moons you get in Ultima VI, I head out to solve the quest.From visiting the towns, it soon transpires that the evil trio have replaced the principles of truth, love, and courage with sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll. The \"virtues\" are now derivatives of these principles: intoxication, promiscuity, rhythm, virility, dancing, heavy metal, and partying. \"Rehab\" replaces humility as standing outside the virtues.Mariah is now running a pizza parlor.Here, it's easier to see on a chart:To combat the problem and win the game, I had to:Gather the eight \"sigils\" of each new virtue and deliver them to Hawkwind at Lord British's castle.Learn the mantras of each virtue (promiscuity is HO, partying is WOO, and rehab is, of course, NO) and mediate on them at the shrines, getting from them the location to which to send the...Dukes of Hazzard...look, you had to be there.Raise the Codex from the Abyss and learn how to defeat Mondain, Minax, and Exodus.Do a few errands for people who had the items I neededTravel to each of the keeps and defeat the triumvirate.Of course, there was plenty of humor along the way. And loads and loads of 1980s pop culture references. I'm sure I missed a lot, but I caught references to Impossible Mission, Knight Rider, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, King's Quest, Magnum P.I., Night Court, People's Court, E.T., Tunnels of Doom, Deliverance, the Beastie Boys, The Bard's Tale, Pac-Man, the Artist Formerly and Apparently Again Known as Prince, The Dukes of Hazzard, Adventure (the old Atari game), Akalabeth, Rogue, Questron, Wheel of Fortune, Father Knows Best, whatever game sparked the \"all your base are belong to us\" meme, Pirates!, and Army of Darkness.Some of them were simply ingenious. When I visited Buccaneer's Den to buy some maps from the bartender, instead of taking me into a typical Ultima V town, the game brought up the town screen from Pirates!I still didn't get anywhere with the governor's daughter.I also got a flashback to a game that I hadn't thought about in years: The Impossible Mission. I had it for my C64 and never won it--I couldn't figure out how to put the maps together. Anyway, a character who looked like the PC icon in IM gave me a quest to get a computer code (it turned out to be \"123456\") from Professor Atombender, who had set up shop in the Dungeon Destard. As soon as I walked into the room with his robots, I was hit with the familiar recording from the beginning of that game: \"Ah! Another visitor! Stay a while. Stay FOREVER!\"Here's a whole mess of other references that had me laughing and show the creator's encyclopedic knowledge of the era:The quests to get the sigils were generally creative and funny. Perhaps the most memorable was the Toga of Partying. Shamino was wearing it (all of my Ultima IV companions had been thoroughly corrupted) and refused to take it off until I gave him several bottles of ale, at which point he doffed it and went streaking.Yes, that is Shamino's penis. I am no longer sorry about what happened to him in Ultima V.The longest quest to solve was Julia's. She had become a pole dancer in Minoc to pay her way through college. I had to drum up 1,500 gold pieces to pay her tuition so she could give me the pole--the Sigil of Dancing--which required a lot of dungeon-delving. The dungeons were mostly non-parodies and actually very interesting to explore, with lots of pressure plates, triggers, and secret doors. I got a real thrill when I solved a series of them and found a magic axe.A dungeon room at least as interesting as anything in Ultima V.The Sigil of Virility turned out to be a bottle of Viagra, which Jaana immediately wanted me to put to use. Fortunately, Katrina showed up at her window and...blocked me. In fact, she did that twice.\"Justice  is truth, tempered by love! I'm sorry, I couldn't keep a  straight face.  Honestly, hast thou ever sat in a courtroom and thought,  'yes, this is  the worldly manifestation of truth and love'? Neither  have I.\" - JaanaNew Magincia--which still had some skeletons hanging around from Ultima IV--had been turned into a giant rehab clinic, and to get the Sigil of Rehab, I had to help Katrina (looking like an old woman--I had always pictured her young and virile) figure out which patient was ready to be released.As I said, the Kit itself makes a pretty good game. Yes, it only supports a single character, but the interface is very intuitive. It has an easy but satisfying leveling and attribute system. It allows a wide variety of weapons and armor, including swamp boots--which protect you from poison just as in Ultima VI--and the inventory screen very clearly shows which is better. On the inventory, incidentally, the game had me bring a shotgun from  home. I didn't realize it had a limited number of rounds, and I wasted  them on low-level monsters. I really could have used it at the end.Note the Army of Darkness reference. Later, the game has me telling Lord British to send me home, \"like in the deal.\"Dialogue is both presented with Ultima IV/V keywords (as you've seen in other shots) and one-liners from minor characters, as in Ultima II/III.The college in Moonglow, under the influence of Intoxication, became a party school.There were a lot of monsters in the game, some using Ultima V icons, some with original ones. Almost all of them had original names. Among the more memorable were demented crows, voyeurs (gazers), evil butterflies, capybaras, evil supermodels and meth addicts (both using the skeleton icon), cheese golems and Dorito golems, forum trolls, and flushed goldfish. Their names were silly, but combat against them was legitimately difficult, especially at the end in Exodus's castle. The combat system is less advanced than Ultima V, but it supports targeting with both ranged and missile weapons, and the magic system--while not using all the reagents (you bought them all pureed together in a blender), supports a lot of different spells. I didn't get to cast them all.The game had fun explaining why certain things happened between Ultima IV and Ultima V. Namely:Vesper is gone because I helped Sin'Vraal destroy the lake, leaving the town to dry up with only Sin'Vraal's house remaining.I raised the Codex myself--using a magic fishing pole that Julia made. \"Deep below,\" the game notes, \"You hear screaming, yelling, and the flapping of wings. You're sure it's nothing to worry about, though.\"The Shadowlords invade Britannia because they make use of a bong I dropped into a whirlpool, get the munchies, and chase a rumor that Britannia has a White Castle.Magic reagents cause blindness, which is why all the herb sellers are blind.Blackthorn became reagent because when Lord British asked who would rule while he was off exploring, I said it didn't matter and pointed to some random guy in the corner.I sealed the dungeons myself, on a quest for the Great Council, whose member summed up the attitude of most Britannians perfectly:The Guardian, a friendly bloke, was created by Hawkwind to guard the eight corrupted Sigils in some alternate dimension. Hawkwind assured me that nothing could go wrong.If you die in the game, as I did twice, you find yourself on a tropic  island with a beautiful woman--just before Lord British resurrects you  and yanks you back into the real world again. Shades of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, season 6!It would have been funnier if he'd made it Sarah Michelle Gellar.The final quests to destroy the triumvirate were fun, especially Minax's. She had taken over Empath Abbey, and upon entry I was thrust back into a world of graphics and textures from Ultima II.I had to take the old rocket to Planet X to get Father Antos to annul her marriage, and the game had me encounter Richard Garriott--who has, of course, famously traveled into space himself.Now, I did win the game, but somehow after I won, the game (or some other corruption) ended up clearing my DOSBox capture folder and the saved games, so I don't have any ending screen shots. The ending was rather amusing, in which I take Lord British to task for not doing anything himself, and he vows to solve the next problem on his own. I leave Britannia saying to myself that the old coot will likely get himself into trouble and I'll have to rescue him again.The Orb of Cheating made the game go pretty quickly.All in all, it was a satisfying and amusing day's diversion. It probably would have taken longer without the Orb of Cheating, but there's only a limited amount of time I want to spend on a parody. I recommend that you play it yourself, and keep me appraised if you see any new games being released with the Adventure Creation Kit. It's Addict-Approved\u2122!The Codex of Ultimate Wisdom, according to this game."}, {"title": "Ultima V: Final Rating", "date": "Tuesday, September 13, 2011", "text": "If you don't have Lord British's sandalwood box, your characters end up just wandering around his chamber. Forever. Thankfully, we have plenty of food, and the male/female ratio is about equal.Looking through several walkthroughs for Ultima V, I realized there were a few things that I missed. First, some of the surlier characters in the game, including a mage named Flain in Skara Brae (who was a pain in the neck to get to), the characters at Windmere (which I talked about a few postings ago), and the corrupt Judge Dryden in Yew, were members of \"The Oppression,\" a society dedicated to helping Blackthorn. This didn't provide an alternate ending to the game, but I could have tried to infiltrate them and obtain their \"black badge,\" which apparently would have made Blackthorn and his guards friendly. An interesting side quest.The second thing was that I completely overlooked mystics! I guess I could have gotten both mystic swords and mystic armor from a volcano in the underworld. I do vaguely remember a clue of that nature, but I neglected to follow up on it. It didn't hurt me any, but this makes the second game in a row in which I ignored the fabled mystics. The third overlooked item were the plans for the HMS Cape, which were hidden in the shipwright's in Britain. I remember an NPC telling me that the master had lost them, but it didn't occur to me to just search his house. The plans would have made my frigates faster and probably cut down on some of the sea battles.If I had to not be paying attention to something, I suppose it was a good thing it was this and not the sandalwood box.In looking over these spoilers, I learned a little about Ultima V: Lazarus, a 2005 remake using the Dungeon Siege engine. Apparently, it greatly expands the dialogue and back stories, and includes extra quests, including more on the Oppression. I had told one commenter that I would check it out while playing Ultima V, but it seems like a game worthy of its own entries, so I've added it to my game list for that year.On to my GIMLET. I would note, incidentally, that my blog is the third entry if you search for \"gimlet\" on Google. The second entry, a Wikipedia page, notes that the term, in addition to the drink, describes a tool, an unincorporated town in Kentucky, a surface-to-air missile, a rocket, a fantasy character, a tree, and a Transformers character. It's a diverse term. Oh, and it was director Ed Wood's favorite cocktail.1. Game World. Large, open, and interesting. The back story of the game is compelling and well-narrated, and the world itself is full of interesting terrain, cities, towns, keeps, lighthouses, dungeons, and other places to explore. Origin's manuals continue to top the competition in  their history and description of the land and its people. It's one of the few games of any era in which the entire world--rather than just discrete pieces of it--is explorable from the outset. I went into this thinking that I needed to exceed my score for Ultima IV by at least one, but I think I rated Ultima IV too high (8). Ultima V's world is fantastic, to be sure, but the game lacks one of my key elements here: \"decisions and actions measurably affect the game world.\" I was a bit disappointed that no one--not even Blackthorn--bothered to notice when I killed the Shadowlords. I have to save perfect scores for games like Morrowind that not only have a large, interesting world but lots of little diversions and a sense of adaptation to my actions. Score: 8.The Book of Lore is well-written and sets the back story nicely.2. Character creation and development. The character creation process is essentially the same as Ultima IV, but the consequences are less noticeable, since no matter what virtues you choose, you end up in the \"Avatar\" class (which is an adaptation of only three classes: bard, fighter, and mage) and you start the game in the same location. While basing characters on virtue is an interesting concept, the rest of the character development system is a bit of a let down. You can progress through eight levels, but you really have to grind to get past six. You only have three ability scores, and a few limited means to raise them. Tying spell levels to character levels does make development a bit more necessary, and the \"karma\" system is unique for the era. Overall, though, I would have liked to see more options here. Score: 4.The paltry selection of character attributes.3. NPC Interaction. The Ultima series continues to blow its rivals out of the water with the number of NPCs and the depth of interaction with them. The dialogue system is almost unique to the series, and talking with NPCs is absolutely essential for both advancing the plot and proving your virtue. The game goes beyond Ultima IV in offering more than just dialogue options during NPC interaction--you follow around suspicious characters, avoid guards, free prisoners from jail, among other things. Certain NPCs join you--Origin was the first for this in IV, I think, and in this game they have another first in that there are more NPCs who will join than you can accomodate, allowing you to choose based on value to the party. Finally, the daily activity cycle kept by the NPCs is a first in this game, and doesn't recur even in a lot of modern games. The only thing it lacks is true \"dialogue options.\" Score: 8.\u00a0 4. Encounters and foes. There are a handful of memorable encounters in the game, with Blackthorn, the daemon guarding Stonegate, and a few others in which you have some role-playing options. Your enemies in the game are well-described in the manual, and they all distinguished by their methods of attack: wisps possess you, daemons summon comrades, squids shoot poison, reapers try to put you to sleep, orcs just charge. I like that they flee when they get to \"critical\" levels, too. Each type of foe carries a different volume of treasure, and I got a real tingle when I found myself facing reapers or dragons (if I knew I could beat them!). Monsters respawn constantly in the world, leaving plenty of opportunities for grinding. But the most original thing about this game is the different types of dungeon rooms, each of which requires a different strategy to defeat and navigate. Score: 7.5. Magic and combat. The Ultima series, while never perfect in either aspect, continues to get better. I covered both magic and combat extensively in related postings. The game added a lot of variety to combat, with multiple attacks, attacks that go astray, the ability to target anywhere on the screen, lots of items to use, and weapons that attack at varying ranges. There were a lot of tactics associated with different terrains and party formation. I still never found it really fun in the way that Pool of Radiance was, but I can't say that it bored me like Ultima IV did, and it was a lot more dangerous. The magic system, with its requirements to mix reagents and its syllable-based spells, is, as I covered, very original and yet almost wholly unnecessary. I wish there had been more mass effect spells at lower levels and buffing spells to increase characters' ability scores. Score: 6.Another member of the Oppression falls.6. Equipment. A huge leap over IV. Instead of just a few weapons and armor, you have a large variety of ranged and missile weapons, helms, armor, shields, boots, rings, amulets, potions, and scrolls. Described well by the merchants, they are ordered in your inventory according to power, so you never doubt which is the best. In addition to the standard combat items, gems, keys, and torches are important for exploration, and there are a host of special items--grapple, sextant, spyglass, pocketwatch, amulet, crown, and scepter--each of which has a special purpose. I also liked that you could find equipment on slain foes; it wasn't just a matter of purchasing it. When every other combat seems to provide something new to don, wield, or use, I have a lot of fun with the game. My only quibble is that every character could wield every weapon and armor; I think some class restrictions would have made it more interesting. Score: 7.Regrettably, I went right to magic axes.7. Economy. For about 8/10 of the game, the economy is perfect. You almost always have an economic goal: buy a skiff, buy a frigate, outfit the party with magic axes, buy magic shields, stock up on reagents, max out on gems, and so on. The game also offers other ways to spend money by donating at shrines (if you need the karma), paying for information from some NPCs, donating to beggars, and purchasing healing. The only downside is that towards the end of the game, you have far too much money, but this does tend to happen very late. All in all, one of the best systems of the era. Score: 8.8. Quests. Like IV before it, Ultima V has a very compelling main quest that, again, does not involve the traditional \"slay the wizard\" trope. Instead, you have to assemble some items and proceed through various challenges to rescue Lord British from the Underworld. It isn't quite as groundbreaking as the Quest of the Avatar, but it's up there. There are some quasi-side-quests, such as joining the Oppression and finding the hidden reagents, but these barely qualify. Score: 7.9. Graphics, sound, and inputs. I loved the graphics in this game: the way the dungeon walls had their own textures, the furnishings and decorations in the buildings, the animated icons for the enemies. There were cute little touches, like the way you were reflected in mirrors and could \"sit down\" on chairs and harpsichord benches. I'm not claiming the graphics stand up to modern games, but all they have to be is \"good enough\" to get the maximum score, and these are definitely good enough. On the sound...well, Origin is trying. They were just a bit above painful, and it was cute how they made the clocks chime and the waterfalls ripple and the harpsichords actually play--even if the sound quality, on DOS machines of the era, is a bit poor (and, yes, I know it was probably better on other platforms; I have to rate what I played). The controls are near-perfect: Mastery is almost instantaneous, with each letter standing for a sensible action, and inventories simply controlled by the arrows. The best controls are the ones you never have to think about, and Ultima V exemplifies that. Score: 6.10. Gameplay. V continues IV's tradition of nonlinearity. Yes, you have to achieve certain things to win the game, but you can achieve them in almost any order, and the sense of openness is very satisfying--witness the way I decided to follow Lord British into the Underworld when my characters were still low levels. The difficulty and pacing are both almost pitch-perfect. I thought it was a little too easy in the final dungeon, but beyond that, it was both challenging (as the number of full-party deaths I experienced can attest) and continually enjoyable. I wouldn't have minded a couple more dungeons, even. It is, alas, not very replayable, unless you want to try different challenges, like completing the game with a single PC. Score: 8.I confess that my final rating of 69 is a bit of a surprise. This makes Ultima V the highest-rated game in my blog so far, beating Pool of Radiance by 4 points and its predecessor by 14 points. Truth be told, I think I enjoyed Pool of Radiance slightly more, but the difference isn't notable enough to revise the GIMLET, and I might have mentally ranked Ultima V higher if I didn't have to take such a long time-out in August. I might also have mentally ranked it higher if it had a better ending--I almost want to subtract points for that. Why do I keep helping Lord British if he's just going to boot me out of Britannia the moment he's done with me?I have seen Ultima V described as the best CRPG of all time. I think you could make a strong argument that it is, at least, the best CRPG of the 1980s. I still like the plot of IV better, but the gameplay experience is far better in V. This makes it all the more surprising that Scorpia gave the game such a lukewarm review in the May 1988 issue of Computer Gaming World [large file]. While noting the graphics and object-interaction innovations, she bemoans the fewer characters found in V--I didn't notice this and don't actually believe it--and the lack of new monster types, which I also disagree with. She calls the combat system \"irritating\" and a \"long drawn-out affair,\" and she spends a long time complaining about trivial omissions from the manual. Nonetheless, her \"bottom line\" is that the game is \"not to be missed!\" so I guess there's that.Moving on, I think I'm going to take a quick \"special topics\" diversion on a little parody called Ultima IV Part 2 before checking out Visions of the Aftermath."}, {"title": "Ultima V: Won!", "date": "Monday, September 12, 2011", "text": "Anyone have Richard Garriott's e-mail?The Dungeon Doom was hard, but not as hard as I expected. I finished it in about 2.5 hours of playing. Among the points that make  it difficult:It's a maze--a complex maze that has you going up and down many times looking for the right path.Once you enter, you can't get out except by dying.Almost every room has some sort of puzzle or set of triggers you need to solve to advance.The monsters are fairly hard, including several rooms of both dragons and sea serpents.Invisibility rings--game breakers in other dungeons--don't work at all. And I had eight of them saved up. Bollocks.A level with no way to go but back up.But there were a few factors that made it not so tough:Most of the creatures are magical, and the crown negates their worst attacks.Many of the rooms start you with barriers between you and the enemies, allowing you to attack them across the barriers with pole-arms.There's no one big \"final\" battle.I over-prepared for the dungeon, loading up with the maximum possible reagents, items, and spells. I only used about 12 of my 99 VAS MANI (\"great heal\") spells.I had half a dozen \"resurrect\" scrolls when I entered.One thing is certain: I didn't need to do all that grinding the other day. I think I could have made it with Level 5 characters.When you first enter the dungeon, it fools you into thinking you're making progress. Adopting the expedient of going down when I could and backtracking when I couldn't, I was on Level 6 in no time. Most of the battles were in rooms like this......where I could calmly take out the enemies across the barriers before dispelling them. However, I soon began to encounter tougher fights. This one introduced me to a new enemy: sand traps. As a golfer, I found it delightful to kill them.You don't like it so much when I shank my magic axe into you, do you?When I initially entered this room, I backed everyone out the door except my Avatar, had him don the ring of invisibility...and promptly got slaughtered. The monsters in this dungeon don't even acknowledge it. I had to resurrect him with a scroll and try again. Dragons and sand traps carry fabulous amounts of treasure, which of course is utterly useless here.In the room directly below the one above, I encountered dragons and sea serpents, and I lost Gwenno in the course of the combat. As you can see from the screen shot, there appears to be no way out of the room except the ladder I came from, but when I attacked the wall in the far northwest corner with my magic axe, a bridge appeared. I don't know what would have happened if I didn't have ranged weapons.Later on, for the first time in the game, some sharks were able to engage me in melee combat.We're going to need a bigger axe.The final combat room (which I didn't know at the time) was swarming with daemons and mongbats, and it seemed quite difficult at first. When my Avatar moved forward, the ground that everyone was standing on changed to lava. I took so much damage that I eventually led them back down the ladder, but I lost both my Avatar and Iolo in the room. Two more resurrection scrolls wasted.On the second try, I avoided the lava-causing spot and opened just a corner of the barrier. Letting the monsters come to me one-by-one, I was able to defeat them handily.This turned out to be the last combat. Just like Ultima IV, it was a little anticlimactic in that regard. (Actually, pretty much every Ultima except the first one is a little anticlimactic when it comes to combat. In II, you spend more time chasing Minax than battling her. In III, if I recall correctly, the final battle is with the floor.) I figured I'd have to fight Blackthorn or someone. I didn't even get a chance to use my glass sword--there's a lesson about saving your weapons too long.Once I realized that was the end of the game, I reloaded before the room so I could video the final combat as well as the endgame. Somehow I hit the wrong key combination, though, and missed the final combat, so the recording picks up just as I'm leaving the room.Essentially, I find myself in nice, well-furnished room, with Lord British in a mirror at the north end. Moving in front of the mirror, each of my characters gets sucked in, to find themselves in a mirrored room on the other side. Lord British, after only a perfunctory greeting, asks for his box.Opening it up, he explains that it contains the Orb of the Moons, an artifact from Earth that opens up moongates. Tossing it on the floor, a gate opens and we both go through. He ends up back in Britannia, and I end up back on Earth.One of the better jokes in a CRPG.I tell you, my Avatar is pissed. I spent all that time rescuing him, and he immediately sends me home? Don't I have any choice in this at all? Could I maybe say goodbye to my friends first? What if I like Britannia better? Could I become the baron of Blackthorn's old castle?Oh, well. At least I get to see Blackthorn's fate. In a dream, I see British confront Blackthorn and give him the choice of a trial or taking the Orb of Moons to a random world. Blackthorn chooses the latter. I have this vague memory that I encounter him again in a later game, but I'm not sure. No spoilers!The problem with Lord British's belief is that Blackthorn didn't become \"good\" once I killed the Shadowlords.Thus, the game is concluded, only a few days after I was thinking I would have to abandon it for later. I'd like to look forward to Ultima VI, but there are more games than I've already played between now and then.On to the GIMLET and then a pair of post-apocalyptic CRPGs!"}, {"title": "Ultima V: Things I Discovered While Replaying", "date": "Sunday, September 11, 2011", "text": "You can't even kill Blackthorn in bed.As I noted in an edit to my last posting, I was able to find a backup of the saved game that I had made on September 1. This meant that I hadn't killed the Shadowlords, visited the dungeons, or explored the Underworld yet, but with the notes I had, these things ended up not taking as long as I thought--especially since I hex-edited my saved game so that my characters would have the same experience as when the file got corrupted. (Thus, the only thing I didn't have to re-do was the long \"grinding\" process.) I took the opportunity, while running around Britannia to solve the game again, to learn a few things I hadn't figured out in my initial play. Most of these involved reloading.Q: What happens if you give Blackthorn the Mantra to the Shrine of Honesty?A: He kills your companion anyway. I feel better about Shamino.Then, when you visit the Shrine of Honesty, you find it destroyed. I'm not sure if there's a way to restore it.Q: What happens if you get caught in Blackthorn's castle, but you don't have a companion for him to execute?A: He just tosses you in his dungeon. The moral: the Avatar should work alone.Q: How does Blackthorn treat you if you show up with the \"black badge\" of the Oppression?A: Supposedly, he treats you nicely and the guards don't seize you. I didn't experience that--I got caught and thrown in jail just like before. Maybe it was because I had already killed the Shadowlords and stolen the crown.[Later edit: As Claus notes below, you have to actually be wearing the badge. Then the guards let you pass (if you give the Oppression password) and Blackthorn is nice to you.]Q: Can you kill Blackthorn, even with the glass sword, magic axes, invisibility rings, and the crown in effect so he can't summon daemons or cast spells?A: Doesn't look like it. However, if you don the invisibility ring, Blackthorn flees from battle and the game tells you that you have achieved \"VICTORY!\" Blackthorn doesn't appear in his castle anymore, even if you leave and return. I don't know if this is permanent.Q: What happens if you attack the Shadowlords?A: I don't know why I didn't try this before. If you engage a Shadowlord in combat, first, he takes back the scepter. Then, you enter combat with your party members divided by magic fields (which you would need the scepter to dispel).He's a little tougher than a daemon, but you can defeat him without too much trouble. The only problem is that when he gets \"critical,\" he retreats to the center of the screen, where you can't hit him unless you have a pole-arm. I did, and was able to kill him (I used the glass sword just for the heck of it), but the game only tells you that he \"vanishes.\" Later, he'll reappear in towns, or Stonegate, just as if you had never fought him.Q: What if you're not on the magic carpet, and you fall down the trap doors in Stonegate?A:  You take a long fall to the center of the world, and everyone dies.Q: What happens if you commit a crime (theft, murder, refuse to give guards their tribute) and \"go quietly\"?A:  You end up in jail in Yew, in a cell next to Jerone. You have all your equipment but no keys. However, you can cast an \"unlock\" spell or wait for Jerone's brother to show up at noon and ask him for keys.I missed another opportunity to use the Avatar's trademark \"SOD OFF.\"Q: Are there any reasons to visit the shrines after you do the shrine quests?A:  You can meditate, and the shrines ask you to donate gold. If you  choose to donate, the game says \"ALAKAZAM!\" and your karma, if it's less than 99, increases.So basically I can just buy my way out of my crimes.Q: What if you ruin your karma through theft and murder?A:  Lord British shows up at night and tells you to get your act together. But he still heals everyone first.I don't want to tell you what I did to get this message. All the gold in the world donated to shrines shouldn't get me out of it.Q: Can you ever get to the point where you can kill guards?A:  Aside from Lord Blackthorn, who is un-killable, guards have to be the toughest foes in the game. The have a devastating missile attack. IN VAS POR YLEM (\"tremor\") does virtually nothing against them, they're very hard to hit, and they attack in waves of 8. I was able to take them out with multiple \"negate time\" spells and invisibility rings, but only with significant losses. They hardly leave any treasure, and at 25 experience, they're not worth the time. Also,  you lose 5 karma for attacking them.I fought the law and the law won.Q: What happens if you go to the Dungeon Doom before killing the Shadowlords?A:  You get lost in the darkness surrounding the dungeon. You don't move  anywhere, and the only possible exit, as far as I can tell, is either to  reload or, if you were unfortunate enough to save in the darkness, keep  holing up and camping until your food runs out and you die. [Later  edit: Okay, this might be a consequence of going without the Amulet.  Now I'm not sure what happens if the Shadowlords are alive.]The \"locate\" spell shows me at the same location even though I moved two spaces to the east.At the end of a long day and a half of gameplay, my party was where it was before my game got corrupted: in the first room of the Dungeon Doom--with, apparently, no way back to the surface.

Suffice to say, I spent about 4 hours killing foe after foe in an attempt to raise my characters one more level before taking on the final dungeon. I'm not sure if it's bad game balance to require so much grinding, or if I just finished the main part of the game much quicker than the creators intended.Donn's clue about being able to attack creatures behind walls with polearms was much appreciated.I couldn't make up my mind whether to do my grinding on the surface, in the Underworld, or in dungeons, so I vacillated among them. I did find one square level in Wrong that seemed to spawn a new foe--often reapers--every time I turned a corner. I stayed there for a good long while. Later, on the surface, I sold my accumulated loot and bought 99 of every reagent (again), mixed 99 \"great heal\" spells, 99 regular heal spells, 99 \"kill\" spells, and a bunch of other spells. I bought 9,999 food, 99 each of keys, gems, and torches, and I still had more gold than I knew what to do with.When I was done, Lord British at last raised my Avatar to Level 7 and all my other characters to Level 6. Getting Level 8 would take exactly double my current experience, and I couldn't see doing that. Thus, I prepared to return to the final dungeon and win the game.I don't even want to tell you this next part.Grinding was boring, see, so I had been watching Scrubs on Netflix Instant Play in one window while I played in another. Well, I'm having this recurring problem where my computer crashes if I'm watching a video in a window and messing around in an application in another. \"Crashes\" doesn't go far enough. The screen goes blank and the computer starts shrieking at me until I hold down the power button long enough to force it to shut off.When I restarted and tried to go back into Ultima V, I got this:My save game is corrupted. And, no, I haven't been making any backups.I'm devastated. I can't not win this game, but the idea of starting over with a new character is too much to think about right now. Suggestions welcome.[Later edit: It turns out my standard backup also backs up my \"games\" folder. This is good news, but I last ran it on September 1. I am currently re-doing all the stuff I did after the \"Finishing up on the Surface\" posting. After that, instead of grinding, I will hex-edit my characters to the experience levels they had when my game got corrupted. Thanks for all your suggestions. While the method I'm following takes a lot more time than a pre-saved game, I just don't feel right completing the game without my \"real\" party.]"}, {"title": "Ultima V: Ars Arcanum", "date": "Tuesday, September 6, 2011", "text": "The party dispels a field--back in the day when that kind of thing was necessary.The magic system in Ultima V  is one of the most interesting of the Ultima series--indeed, of any series--and yet it doesn't feel terribly necessary. At this point in the game, I only have one dungeon left to complete (although I do have a bit of leveling-up to do), and the only spells I have bothered to cast are cure poison, heal, great heal, and dispel field--not counting a couple of light and magic missile spells, but only because they were in my inventory when I started the game.I'll cover the spell system and then explain why I haven't been using it. Over a year ago, I discussed CRPG magic systems in the context of Ultima IV, and I came up with several dimensions of CRPG spells systems:Spell acquisition: Whether you get spells all at once, or are restricted by level, or have to buy them, and so on.Spell limitations: Slots or \"spell points.\"Spell regeneration: How you get your spells back.Spell access: How you actually cast them (type the name, select from a book, etc.)Character limitations: Whether the game restricts certain classes to certain spells, and whether certain characters can cast at all.Physical objects: Talismans, reagents, and the like.Spell stratification: \"Schools\" and such.Custom spells: Whether the character can define his or her own based on effects.Items as spell proxies: Wands, scrolls, and so on.Magic as a requirement: Whether spells are necessary to complete the game.Ultima IV offered 26 spells, each with its own letter, which were immediately available to every character at the start of the game, provided he or she had enough spell points and could mix the right reagents. Ultima V offers 45 spells in the spell book, each vividly described, and at least two others that you determine through dialogue with NPCs. However, they're arranged into eight \"circles\" of magic, and you have to be the same level to cast spells of that circle. You also have magic points, dependent on level and intelligence, and each spell takes a number of points equal to its level. The only way to regain spell points is to rest.Each spell in this game is a combination of between one and four syllables, a system that we first saw, I think, in Dungeon Master. There are 24 total syllables, and they're distinct and sensible enough that I've found it fairly easy to remember them after only one or two viewings. Here are a few of the syllables:AN: NegateCORP: DeathFLAM: FlameIN: CreateKAL: Call or summonNOX: PoisionPOR: MovementREL: ChangeVAS: GreatXEN: CreatureTo figure out what spell you want to cast, you simply have to combine the syllables in a logical order. Want to cure poison? That must be AN NOX. Feel like summoning an undead? String together KAL XEN CORP, but if you just want an animal, that's KAL XEN. MANI does some healing, VAS MANI does a lot of healing, and IN MANI CORP resurrects. Unfortunately, not every possible combination is used: You can't IN NOX to poison someone or KAL VAS XEN FLAM to summon a giant creature of flame. But when a character tells you he's perfected a spell that uses the syllables REL XEN BET (\"change small creature\") to turn a foe into a rat, it makes perfect sense. (This one of only two spells I've found through dialogue; the other is Lord Stuart the Hungry's \"create food.\")The spell seems to have backfired on its creator.As far as I can tell, the only spells that didn't make it from IV are iceball, jinx, and exit (dungeons), the latter of which I really miss.As in IV, you have to pre-mix your spells by selecting the right reagents. The book gives you most of the combinations, but again they all make logical sense. Black pearl is used for missiles, sulphurous ash for fire and energy, nightshade for poison, garlic for warding, ginseng for healing, blood moss for movement, spider silk for binding, and mandrake for that extra oomph of power. If you want to heal with a MANI, you need ginseng for the healing and spider silk to bind it, but VAS MANI needs some mandrake, too, for that extra power. A magic missile (GRAV POR) needs ash for the energy and pearl for the projection.Mixing reagents for a healing spell.Unlike the previous game, all reagents are available for purchase, although nightshade and mandrake are expensive. You can still find them in their spots on the Bloody Plains and Spiritwood, but only at midnight, and you only get a few units each day. I'd rather spend that day killing trolls and just buying the reagents. Also, unlike in IV, the herb sellers aren't blind and don't give you the option to just pay whatever for your reagents. I think this is the last Ultima game to actually make you mix reagents. I seem to remember that you need them in VI and VII, but the game will just take them automatically from your backpack when you cast the spell.I waited all day to find three sprigs, which would have cost me 45 gold pieces in Moonglow.Despite the fact that I like the spell system, as I said, I haven't really used it. There are a few factors that go into this. Primarily, it's that there are objects that do the same thing as the most necessary spells: torches instead of LOR (\"light\"), keys instead of AN SANCT (\"unlock\"), a sextant instead of IN WIS (\"locate\"; although that would have helped me in the Underworld), gems instead of IN QUAS WIS (\"peer\") and so on. Lord British's crown does the same thing as IN AN (\"negate magic\"), which you don't get until Level 6, and his scepter obviates AN GRAV (\"dispel field\"). You also find a lot of potions and scrolls that cast some of the higher-level spells long before you get them. I just realized I'm carrying a pile of both whose uses I haven't even bothered to research.There are a handful of spells that seem somewhat useless. KAL XEN gives you a rat or a snake, which lasts about one round in most combats. REL HUR changes the wind to your favored direction, but the winds are constantly changing anyway. You'd have to be in a real hurry to bother (in Ultima IV you needed it for the balloon). AN EX POR puts a magic lock on a door. Creatures never open doors, so the only use I could see it for would be a guard, but guards don't really chase you more than a few steps anyway. Others, like magic missile and fireball, are probably good at the beginning but are quickly outpaced by weapons; perhaps if the game didn't let any character wield any weapon, I'd find more use for them.There are some intriguing options with the various \"wall\" spells, which allow you to create squares of fire, poison, or sleep. If I was a better battle tactician, or if the battles were harder, I could see using these to channel enemies or force them to fight me while knee-deep in flames. The problem is, most of the really difficult battles are with magic-using creatures, in which you immediately want to don Lord British's crown and cancel all magic, including yours. [Later edit: I was wrong about this--see comments.]Nonetheless, now that my Avatar is Level 6, I can see some use for the charm, tremor, and confuse spells he just got, and things get really interesting at Levels 7 and 8, with poison wind, flame wind, fear, clone, kill, time stop, cone of energy, and resurrect. I'm just not sure I'm going to make it there.As I noted in the last blog entry, I've reached a point where I'm ready for the endgame in terms of plot, but not in terms of levels. I need to do some grinding. I thought I'd use this opportunity to try out the offensive spells that I hadn't already cast. Using the moongate I'd planted there, I took myself to the Underworld next to the egress of Shame, entered the dungeon, and began stalking the corridors for random encounters. Unfortunately, they weren't quite as plentiful as I'd hoped. So I wandered around the underworld instead, attacking roving bands of bats, mongbats, dragons, daemons, and corpsers.I can report:Magic missile and fireball do far less damage than my magic axes.\"Call animal\" isn't worth the spell points, although it is vaguely fun. At best, you get cannon fodder for a round or two. I just wish you could specify where you wanted the summoned creature to appear. If it appears behind the ranks, it's easier to kill it than waste time maneuvering it about.One of the most useless potions that you can create in Oblivion is \"resist poison,\" given that poison is fairly rare in the first place, and you don't generally know when you're going to need it ahead of time. God, do I wish there was a \"resist poison\" spell (IN NOX SANCT?) in this game. I'd use it every time I see squids, rats, or pythons on the way.The different \"field\" spells (poison, flame, sleep, and energy) are fun when the enemy has to come to you through a narrow channel. Unfortunately, they only last a couple of rounds.Bats don't last long in a wall of flames.The \"tremor\" spell (IN VAS POR YLEM, or \"create great movement of earth\") isn't quite the mass murderer that I remember from Ultima IV. It doesn't even kill a majority of a horde of rats.I'm going to keep grinding, and eventually we'll see if the Level 7 and 8 spells are worth the wait. If the grinding takes too long, though, I may just throw caution to the wind and head into the final dungeon without them."}, {"title": "Ultima V: Shards, Shadowlords, and the Underworld", "date": "Monday, September 5, 2011", "text": "You've ruined my last visit to Britannia's towns, Astaroth!\r\rUsually, my CRPG addiction is manageable, but yesterday I utterly succumbed. I played Ultima V from sunup to way past sundown, logging more hours in a single day than I had played in the entirety up to this point. I didn't win, but either I'm very close or insanely far away--more on this at the end.\r\rThe day was taken up by two tasks: first, a systematic exploration of the surface of Britannia, in which I entered every town and building, generally for the second time, and asked every person I could about the Shadowlords and Lord British's scepter. This bore fruit, but it was tedious. The second task was to explore each of the seven dungeons (if there's a dungeon that's the antithesis of humility, I can't find it) and the parts of the Underworld beneath them.\r\rAlthough these tasks were interspersed with each other, let me describe it in logical order. First, my discussions with  NPCs led to some revelations about the Shadowlords and their associated Shards of Cowardice, Falsehood, and Hate. It seems that the shards are actually the broken pieces of Mondain's gem, which I had to destroy in the first Ultima game. I got this from a guy named Sutek on an island I had previously overlooked.\r\r\rAs soon as he said this, I remembered this facet of the game from my previous experience with it, more than 15 years ago, but I had completely forgotten about it until now.\r\rBut why did the Shadowlords so recently appear? Well, it turns out that a ship and its crew got sucked into a whirpool and deposited in the Underworld, where they found the shards. They were so evil that they drove the ship's captain, Johne, to kill his three companions. The three Shadowlords sprang \"from their blood\"--one suspects this is a fanciful way of saying that the shards possessed the corpses of the three murdered crewmembers. I got all this from Johne himself, whom I found living in the remains of his ship beneath the dungeon Despise.\r\r\rThis raises a host of questions. Was Mondain's gem sentient? Are the Shadowlords really facets of Mondain himself? That would certainly explain his hatred of Lord British. How did the Shards get into the Underworld to begin with? (My favorite theory: Lord British gave them to some ship's captain to throw into the ocean, and he tossed them into a whirlpool, assuming they'd end up on the bottom of the sea.)\r\rAnyway, the aforementioned Sutek went on to explain that I needed to destroy the three Shards by casting them in the Flames of Truth, Love, and Courage, which are found in the three keeps (The Lycaeum, Empath Abbey, and Serpent's Hold), but only after calling the associated Shadowlords' names and making sure they were standing on top of the flame when I destroyed the gem.\r\rAll of this, of course, first meant finding the three shards in the midst of the Underworld. This took a lot of time, first in getting to the Underworld from the surface, via the dungeons, and second in exploring the Underworld itself. The Underworld isn't like the surface; it's not a contiguous landmass. Instead, it's a series of \"pockets,\" some of which connect to each other and some of which don't. I had some idea where to find the shards based on visions from NPCs, including detailed directions for one and specific coordinates for the other two--but this was of limited utility, since the sextant doesn't work in the Underworld, so I had to try to find the coordinates by using the dungeons' egresses as relative positions. It took a while. [Later edit: it would have taken less time, as PetrusOctavianus points out in the comments, if I'd noted the existence of a simple Level 2 spell.]\r\r\rBefore I get into the dungeons, I'll just mention that after talking to several characters, I found the location of the Shadowlords' surface keep, Stonegate, where they were keeping Lord British's scepter. After getting past a daemon who offered to let me pass by answering a riddle and then attacked me anyway when I got the answer right, I used my magic carpet to dodge the three Shadowlords and grab the scepter. It came in handy in the dungeons, as it dispels poison, sleep, and energy fields.\r\r\rOkay, let's talk about the dungeons. They're well designed and would have been a lot more fun if I hadn't insisted on exploring them all at once in a marathon session. I technically only needed to explore three to get the shards, but to get the full experience, I traversed each one in turn (and good thing I did, or I never would have found Johne). There are seven--each named something that indicates the opposite of an associated virtue (Deceit, Despise, Destard, Wrong, Shame, Covetous, and Hythloth--yeah, okay, the last one doesn't work). Each one has a sort of \"theme\" attached to it. For instance, Wrong is a prison and has \"cells\" in the rooms; Covetous is a catacomb and is filled with undead; and Despise is more of a cave with few rooms and lots of animal enemies. These variations meant different textures, enemies, and styles to the rooms.\r\rSome varied notes on the dungeons and dungeon exploration:\r\rEach one has eight levels, but none progress directly from Level 1 to Level 8. There are rooms on upper levels only accessible from lower ones, and it's better to think of each dungeon as a unified maze rather than a series of levels.\rGems are vital to get through dungeons.\r\rUUS POR and DES POR--this game's equivalent of the (Y)up and (Z)down spells from Ultima IV--are nearly worthless. They almost always failed on me. And there's no equivalent to Ultima IV's (X)it spell, meaning that I mostly had to retrace my steps from the bottom to the top.There are a lot of pit traps.  You have to check gems frequently or just make a habit of searching squares before going forward.\r\rAs in Ultima III and Ultima IV, some mysterious benefactor has erected healing fountains in many of the dungeons, which fully restore health. There are occasionally poison fountains, too.\r\rThere are chests in some corridors, but nothing like the respawning treasure levels in III and IV.\r\rDungeon rooms do not respawn, not even after you leave the dungeon and return. However, if you leave a room incomplete by failing to kill  all of the enemies, upon return you find the room \"reset\" with all the  original enemies and treasure in place. If I wasn't already getting rich  without cheating, an easy way  to cheat would be to loot each room but leave one enemy alive, leave,  return, and do it again. It would also be an easy way to build  experience.Lord British's crown was vital. Donning it cancels all magic in the area, which means that dragons can't summon daemons, daemons can't possess you, ghosts can't turn invisible, wisps can't possess you or teleport, and gazers and reapers have no attacks. For this reason, reapers became my favorite monster in the game. With the crown active, they can't attack, they can't move, they drop loads of treasure, and they offer a lot of experience.\rReapers are sitting ducks. Sitting ducks with golden eggs.\r\rThe crown is a double-edged sword, though. Very often, a room will have wisps trapped behind the walls. With the crown active, they can't teleport out, and thus you can't kill them and clear the room. However, if you take the crown off, you run the very likely risk of a wisp possessing a party member--a condition that takes forever to wear off. Thus, wisps join my list of most annoying CRPG enemies of all time (I'll update it when I remember to take a screen shot).\rThe most difficult creatures I've found in the game are gargoyles. They divide like slimes every time you hit them, but their attack is far worse than slimes--far worse than most monsters in the game, actually. I lost my Avatar in the battle below and had to flee the screen.\rI would note here that these \"gargoyles\" are clearly made of stone and actually leave piles of stone when they die. This will become important in the next game.\r\rI encountered several rooms, like the one below, that had multiple dragons or daemons, who would have wiped me out if not for my rings and potions of invisibility. Invisibility is almost a game-breaker in Ultima V. Creatures utterly ignore invisible characters, even when they attack. An easy strategy is to have all characters except one flee the room, equip the last with a ring of invisibility, and then just walk around massacring things. It gets even worse, actually--if an invisible character is the only character in the room, the game seems to set all of the enemies' statuses to \"critical\"--one hit kills them. Fortunately, the rings disappear after a short amount of use, so you can't completely abuse them.\r\rThis room would have resulted in a party massacre if not for rings of invisibility.\r\rThe rooms are full of secret triggers that open up new areas. To fully  explore a room and ensure that you've gotten all the triggers, you have  to: 1) step on all the squares; 2) study the walls for secret doors; 3)  (K)limb on any rocks; 4) (P)ush rocks, pillars, and objects; and 5)  attack all walls and objects. Fortunately, it's usually clear when  there's something left to discover.\r\rTo give you a sense of the dungeon rooms and the \"triggers,\" I recorded my progress through one of the rooms below. As I enter, I need to get through it to the ladder at the bottom, and the way seems blocked. The video shows the different things I try to find the triggers, as well as several combats. When the dragon appears, my 57-hp Avatar seems on the verge of death, but I equip my ring of invisibility and am able to take him out. On the second dragon, I get sick of how long it's taking, so I send the rest of my characters out the door and kill the dragon in one hit. The treasure that one of them dropped is so plentiful there's actually a chest within the chest.\r\r\r\rAfter cleaning up from the dragons, I leave, grab my party, and head back into the room, hitting the triggers to take the latter down. After that, I do a little Underworld exploration before I remember I'm still recording a video.\r\rI found the three Shards beneath Covetous, Hythloth, and Deceit. Each took quite a bit of exploration and a lot of gems (fortunately, many of the dungeon rooms had piles of them). My grapple came in handy, but there were a lot of peaks I couldn't cross, necessitating the use of the IN POR (\"blink\") spell to move about.\r\rFinding the Shard of Falsehood.\r\rFinding the Shard of Cowardice beneath Hythloth took about an hour by itself, and I was on my last IN POR when I finally found it. Fortunately, I had capitulated and brought some of the moonstones with me, so I was able to make a gate to get out of there. From now on, poor bastards thinking they're traveling from Minoc to Britain are going to end up in the middle of a dark cave. I hope someone erects a warning sign.\r\rExploring the Underworld took up dozens of gems.\r\rOnce I had the three Shards, destroying them--and the Shadowlords--was fairly easy. I made a short video of it below. I had to walk up to each flame, (Y)ell the associated Shadowlord's name to make him appear, wait one turn so he would walk into the flame on his way to attack me, and then (U)se the Shard to cast it into the flame. Within a few minutes, all three Shadowlords were dead! It would feel like more of a triumph if they'd really been difficult enemies throughout the game, but frankly I was able to avoid them fairly easily.\r\r\r\rMy dungeon explorations made me rich beyond all dreams of avarice. The maximum amount of gold you can carry is 9,999, and I reached this several times. I bought magic axes and magic shields for everyone (about 22,000 gold total); bought 99 of every reagent, mixed a ton of spells, and bought 99 of each reagent again; bought five or six ships to leave scattered around Britannia; and stocked up on more than 5,000 units of food. And I still have a ton of gold left.\r\r\rThe message at the end of the shrine quests told me that the final dungeon is in the Underworld near the exit from Shame. I did explore Shame, and when I got out, I immediately planted a moonstone so I'd be able to travel quickly back to that part of the Underworld when I was ready for the endgame.\r\rSo how ready am I? Well, I certainly have enough equipment, reagents, and money, and I think I've done all the stuff I need to do, and gathered all the equipment I need, to hit the final dungeon. The problem is, my Avatar is only Level 6, and the other characters are only Level 5. That means I'm lacking two whole spell levels. I'm not sure how much experience I need for Level 8, but I think I needed 100 for Level 2, 200 for Level 3, 400 for Level 4, 800 for Level 5, and 1,600 for Level 6. That would suggest that Level 7 comes at 3,200 and Level 8 at 6,400. That's going to take a long, long time. I might just attempt the final dungeon now and see how hard it is."}, {"title": "Ultima V: Violence", "date": "Sunday, September 4, 2011", "text": "This is an example of a pointless battle. I don't need to get \"through\" this room; there's no treasure to find; the enemies--sea serpents--don't drop any treasure, and they do a lot of damage. Fortunately, there doesn't seem to be any penalty for fleeing in this game.\r\rCombat has never been a particular strength of the Ultima series, which I find surprising. In a series that has innovated in so may other ways, it has always lagged behind its contemporaries. The first two games featured the simplest type of combat of any CRPG: hitting (a)ttack and specifying a direction. This was forgivable in Akalabeth and maybe the first Ultima, but by Ultima II, Wizardry had come out and was showing the world what real tactical CRPG combat could be.\r\rUltima III--reportedly influenced by Wizardry--improved considerably, with multiple characters and a combination of melee attacks, ranged attacks, and spells. But it was still a bit repetitive and annoying, allowing no attacks on the diagonal and featuring the same bland terrains. Ultima IV fixed the latter issue--terrain actually became part of the combat tactics--but not much else. Many are the players who lined up their characters and then began mashing (a)ttack/up arrow--with many of the characters attacking empty space--until all enemies were dead. It was easier than meticulously moving everyone around the game map.\r\rUltima V's numerous innovations make combat a lot more tolerable, nuanced, and tactical. Among them:\r\rRather than specifying  a direction, you target enemies. Enemies not slain in the previous round remain targeted the next round.You can specify an active character who will be the only one to act each round until you hit \"0\" and unselect him or her. This not only makes it easier to maneuver through dungeon rooms, it allows you to let one character clean up easy combats.There is a much greater variety of weapons and armor, including spiked shields and helms (which dual as weapons) and some 25-30 different types of melee and missile weapons. The game seems to order them in your inventory based on the amount of damage they do (or, in the case of armor, the amount of protection it offers). You also have rings and amulets to wear, and various potions and scrolls to use.\rEach character can have multiple attacks depending on his or her equipment. A character with a long sword, a spiked helm, and a main gauche in his left hand (or some other weapon, or a spiked shield) gets three attacks. This is annoying, though, when the primary weapon is a ranged weapon and there are no targets in melee range. You have to attack once and then ESC the other two.Strength affects the weight of the weapons and armor you can equip. I don't think much else affects it; mages seem happy in metal armor, wielding swords.Missile weapons have varying ranges. Slings can only attack up to four squares, while magic axes seem to be limitless. Most missile weapons--magic axes are an exception--are dangerous to use if an enemy is right next to you. The foe can \"interfere\" with the attack and you lose the round.\rMorning stars can attack across two spaces, which is handy. It's a little silly, though, that I can use them to reach to the other sides of doors and walls.\rMorning stars attack across two spaces. Somehow, Julia is threading that weapon between Invictus and Iolo.\r\rSome weapons, like daggers and spears, function as melee weapons if you attack a creature next to you and ranged weapons if you attack one more than a space away. In the latter case, you lose the weapon.In addition to simply \"missing,\" attacks can go astray and hit non-targeted enemies as well as your own party members! Just a little while ago, my lead character managed to embed his magic axe in Jaana's back while he was aiming at a daemon. This required yet another trip to the surface to pay for resurrection.You can change weapons in combat, although it costs a round.\rSome things haven't changed from Ultima IV, or have only changed a little:\r\rWhen you hit enemies, their health progresses from \"barely wounded\" to \"critical\" before they die. However, some attacks only graze enemies, which I assume does no damage.Enemies in \"critical\" status flee from the battlefield. Unlike the previous game, though, you don't suffer any loss of karma for killing them while they're fleeing.You can escape combat by moving your characters off the battlefield. Again, unlike Ultima IV, you don't seem to suffer any karma loss for doing so.The character who actually makes the kill gets the experience, no matter how many other characters contributed to the enemy's demise. Thus, I frequently scan to see which character has the lowest experience and make that character the \"active\" one towards the end of battle, or when I have enemies trapped behind objects and I'm in no danger from them. For instance, if I'm attacked by sharks or enter a dungeon room with enemies behind a locked door (through which I can still attack them), I'll equip the lowest-experienced character with the magic axe and he can pick them off.\rSince Dupre can attack through the door (even though it makes no sense) and the spider can't, and he needs the experience, I make him the active character and let him pick off the enemies.\r\rCombat takes place in four types of scenarios: outdoors, water, dungeon, and camp. I mentioned that I don't really like water combat, although  it's becoming more tolerable now that I have a supply of magic axes.  Still, you never get any treasure from it, and you can't flee from it if  things get rough. You have to be careful in dungeon combat. I'll cover  dungeons, including their secret rooms and triggers, in a later posting,  but for now, I'll say it's vital to watch for the \"victory!\" message  after all the visible creatures have been killed. If you don't get it,  it's a sign of a) another brigade of enemies hiding in a secret area; or  b) a mimic.\r\rI find that I get attacked in camp about once ever four times I hole up, which is why it's important to set a watch. Attacking creatures don't necessarily wake you up--apparently my characters are so tired, they can sleep through multiple physical injuries--which I found out the hard way when I was nearly wiped out by a horde of rats gnawing on my sleeping party members. Beyond that, though, camp battles aren't so bad, as the network of defenses we apparently take time to erect every time we camp makes it easy to defend against most enemies.\r\rAttacked by slimes in camp.\r\rTerrain plays a fairly large role in combat. When all my characters had melee weapons, I favored dungeon hallways and open plains for maximum maneuverability. Now that I have more missile weapons, I prefer mountains and tight dungeon rooms, where my enemies have to funnel themselves towards me while I pick them off.\r\rMountainous terrain helps with battles against melee creatures.\r\rOf course, enemies often have missile attacks, too. Dragons are the worst--I lost two characters in the Dungeon Deceit a little while ago and had to get them resurrected, and it only took three or four combat rounds. Sea serpents also pack a wallop, and pythons are annoying because their attacks cause poison. I do like the variety of enemies in the game, too. They come in several categories:\r\rHumans: Guards, NPCs, and pirates. Only the latter category is a \"legitimate\" human to fight; the rest risk damage to karma. The game is notably different from previous Ultimas in that you don't find roving bands of human monsters, like thieves and evil mages, to fight.Goons: Gremlins, orcs, trolls, headless, ettins. They have only physical attacks, attack in mobs, and usually leave treasure chests. Gremlins can steal your food if up close.Animals: bats, rats, spiders, pythons, insect swarms. A lot of these have multiple attacks per round and move quite quickly, although they rarely do serious damage. Rats, spiders, and pythons cause poison, though, which is always annoying to treat.Sea Animals: Sharks, sea horses, squids, and sea serpents. Except for sharks, they're all annoying with their missile attacks.Undead: Ghosts and skeletons. You don't need magic weapons to hit them in this game, but they take some serious damage. Ghosts phase in and out of visibility, and skeletons require a real pounding to defeat. Fortunately, the AN XEN CORP spell sends them fleeing.Magic Creatures: Gazers, reapers, wisps, daemons, dragons. They generally have tough magic-based missile attacks and cast different spells each round. Wisps and daemons can possess party members. Fighting them has gotten a lot easier since I learned how to use Lord British's crown (more in the magic posting later this week), but they still pack a punch. Gazers, for some reason, dissolve into insect swarms when you kill them.Slimes: they're in their own class. I've heard some commenters say they find slimes annoying, but I love them. If you do less than a fatal blow, they divide into two slimes. But they hardly do any damage, so I like to equip a low-experience character with \"fists\" and send him wading into a collection of slimes. It's an experience bonanza.Mimics also deserve their own category. They imitate treasure chests and start blasting you with high-damage attacks the moment you approach. Fortunately, once you know to watch for them, they're not too hard. The range on their attacks is less than a sling, so you just need to stand outside their range and hurl axes or stones until they're dead--at which point they usually drop a \"real\" chest with a lot of treasure.\rThat \"chest\" in the lower right is actually a mimic. Jaana is about to magic-missile him through the window.\r\rThe result of all the different types of creatures is that you need a real strategy for each combat. Tactics that work against one enemy do not work against another. This is the purpose of having different types of enemies to begin with--something that a lot of games (e.g., Times of Lore, Questron II) seem to forget.\r\rSome enemies, like orcs and trolls, usually leave treasure chests behind, which you have to disarm to get at the treasure. Others, like rats and spiders, occasionally leave chests (which makes no sense) but more often leave little splats that you can search and sometimes find gold or food (but more often, you find \"nothing,\" \"guts,\" or \"worms\"). Other enemies, like bats and slimes, leave neither treasure nor corpses.\r\rHow did the corpse get \"worms\" already. I just killed him!\r\rDisarming trapped chests is a little annoying. You have to \"(l)ook\" at it first to discern whether it has a trap, and you can't be sure of the result. Sometimes it says it has one when it doesn't; sometimes vice versa. I usually look five or seven times and go with the most common response. If the chest doesn't have a trap and you try to (j)immy the lock, you break a key, which is kind of stupid. Traps include poison (of course), acid, and bombs. But the chests are so full of goodies that they're usually worth it.\r\rFive chests, some gems, and some food. It's moments like these that I live for.\r\rI tried to find a \"representative\" battle that I could record and illustrate some of the combat features, but nothing really came together, so I recorded a brief video of two battles with trolls. I kept recording in the aftermath to illustrate a few other gameplay elements I haven't covered yet.\r\r\r\rAt 00:05, I start passing time on a bridge until the trolls accost me and demand a ransom, which I refuse to pay, starting battle at 00:16. My three rear characters are armed with magic axes. Invictus, in the front, just has a silver sword, and Iolo and Gwenno both wield morning stars. The three lead characters have to advance before attacking, but the three rear characters can just start pounding away.\r\rAt 00:25, you see that the trolls have missle attacks of their own, and they do reasonable damage. At 00:33, Invictus finally gets next to a troll and can attack, and Iolo, armed with a morning star, can attack at 00:43, even though he's one step away (he misses). At 00:47, Julia hurls her magic axe at the troll but misses and hits Invictus instead, but nonetheless we finish the battle quite easily at 00:57 and Invictus (my character with the highest dexterity) begins mopping up the treasure. Since three checks reveal a trap on the chest, he uses a key to jimmy it and collect the loot. I like it when I get gems; they're expensive.\r\rNothing much different happens in the second battle, but I decide to summon a daemon just for the heck of it, so you can see what it does (01:35). The daemon's attack is devastating to the troll (02:08). Notice how at 02:20, the game tells me that there is a trap on the chest, even though there isn't. Since other checks say \"no trap,\" I take my chances and open it rather than breaking a key.\r\rAt 02:49, we hole up and camp to heal our wounds, and Gwenno--my appointed watch--plays a little tune to put us to sleep. We get no attacks nor any visits from Lord British. You can see the next morning how the visible area expands when dawn breaks (03:13), but disappears as I move into a dark forest. I enter the town of Yew (03:34) with the idea of selling the equipment I just looted, but the Shadowlord of Cowardice is in town. I enter anyway and share some brief words with the evil Judge Dryden (03:51), and buy some reagents (04:15). But because of the Shadowlord of Cowardice's presence, the weapon dealer doesn't want anything to do with me (04:40). Avoiding the guards--who will demand a bribe--I take a look at the Shadowlord (05:18) and lead him into the cemetery, which I proceed to grave-rob for no particular reason, although this doesn't affect my karma (05:48; it was 99 before).\r\rIn plot news, I dumped Sentri and collected Jaana. I wish I knew where I had missed Mariah. spent most of the day exploring dungeons--generally retreating the moment I encountered daemons or dragons at lower levels--building up experience, and trying to earn gold for magic axes and reagents.\r\rIn the next couple of postings--I'm not sure of the order yet--I'll talk about dungeons and magic. To wrap up on combat, I would say that all the improvements in Ultima V still don't quite make it \"enjoyable\" in the way that, say, Pool of Radiance was. I think the key weakness is the inability to move diagonally. This means that when you're attacked in tight dungeon corridors, it takes forever to position the characters to fight. I suspect that I'll actually enjoy combat a lot more when all my characters have magic axes and can just stand in one place to kill the enemies."}, {"title": "Ultima V: Finishing Up on the Surface", "date": "Friday, September 2, 2011", "text": "I am not a fan of sea battles.\r\rEvery once in a while, I get obsessed with the idea that I'm not playing a game \"right\"--that I've broken the natural order. I realize this conflicts with my preference for non-linearity, but there it is nonetheless. The last time I played Oblivion, I was about 40 hours into it before I realized I hadn't gone to Anvil yet. I don't know why this bothered me--there was no role-playing reason why I should have gone to Anvil yet--but it just seemed like in previous games, I had somehow gotten to Anvil a lot sooner. It nagged me.\r\rThere are a few others. Like in Baldur's Gate II, something feels wrong if I don't solve the Copper Coronet slave quest early. In Might & Magic VI, I just have to go to Castle Ironheart within the first few hours. In Morrowind, if you play the factions in a certain order, you can end up on a quest inside the Ghostfence way before it feels like you ought to be visiting the place. Do you have anything like this, or am I just crazy?\r\rIn any event, from the beginning, it feels like I've been playing Ultima V wrong. I tried to role-play it by following Lord British's path early, but I don't think I was \"meant\" to go into the Underworld until much later. Now I've compounded the error by doing pretty much everything there is to do on the surface before really exploring a single dungeon. And I did all the shrine quests at once instead of spreading them out over the gameplay. I've visited every town, but my characters have only risen a couple of levels. I've talked to every person I can find, but I've yet to cast a single spell except for AN NOX (cure poison) and MANI (heal). It's like I ordered a steak dinner, but I ate all the vegetables before eating all the mashed potatoes before eating all the steak. You're supposed to spread it out a little.\r\rSo now I've gotten myself into a situation in which pretty much the only thing to do is go exploring all of the dungeons in succession, with occasional trips to towns for equipment. I'm not complaining, but it just feels...wrong.\r\rFor those not interested in my roleplaying angst, here are the things I've accomplished since I last blogged.\r\rThanks to reader DGM for pointing out that my lost magic carpet re-appears in Lord British's private quarters. I went and got it immediately. I'll just pretend that Blackthorn gave it back to Lord British's steward, knowing that it didn't belong to him. Yeah.\rMy poor party trembled and wailed when they saw the fireplace and the charred remnants of their own bodies within.\r\rI visited Sir Simon's keep, Bordermarch, hidden amidst some mountains west of the main continent. This was a valuable trip for several reasons. First, I learned that I need Lord British's crown, crown jewels, scepter, and amulet to rescue him from the underworld. I have the crown and amulet. I haven't even gotten a clue about the jewels, and the scepter (which dispels fields) apparently resides in the Shadowlords' fortress. Not sure where that is. The crown, incidentally, turns out to negate magic when I put it on in combat. I'm not sure whether this negation stops daemons from summoning each other or possessing my characters, but that sure would be nice.While looking around for Sir Simon's, I found the \"Island of Sherlock the Strange.\" No idea what this is about. I searched it and didn't find anything useful.\rI don't want to look at spoilers, but I would really love to know what this is about.\r\rIn Bordermarch, I also finally found Dupre--I had been wondering where he was--and a character named Sentri joined me. The name seemed familiar, so I searched my notes and found that he's the guy who sold me the Quicksword in Ultima II and was the baron of Serpent's Hold in Ultima IV. Unfortunately, both characters are fighters--including Dupre, who as a paladin had some magic points in IV. My only major character from IV that I haven't found is the mage Mariah. I'm probably going to drop Sentri for Jaana in a bit, because I need more of a pure spellcaster.\rIf only Shamino were here, my party would feel complete.\r\rThere's a store in Bordermarch that has some awesome equipment, including magic shields, magic bows, regeneration rings, and amulets of turning. I know where I'm going after I max out on magic axes.\rI wouldn't mind knowing how, precisely, he knows this.\r\rThe game kind-of screws you over with guards. Several times, in towns, I've been approached by guards who demand a 70-gold-piece tribute. If I capitulate, I'm a wuss. But if I say no, I get launched into a combat that I can't possibly win. I've generally done a good job of avoiding guards (especially with the carpet), but sometimes I've accidentally run into them.The shrine quests were a bit repetitive. Each one required me to first meditate at the shrine, then go to the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom on the Island of the Abyss and read about the associated virtue, then return to the shrine. At this point, I got increases in strength, dexterity, or intelligence depending on the virtue. When I finished the last one, I got a message that: \"Beyond Shame's egress is the center of the Underworld. There is a place of darkness. Beyond this darkness lies the gate to the core of the world. When thou art ready, thou must call forth 'Veramocor' to unlock the gate and venture past ethereal wards and stealers of souls. That which the world has lost awaits thy coming.\"\rAnd I interpreted it without consulting the guide once. I feel like those people who learn to speak Klingon.\r\rI'm not sure the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom really lives up to its name. All that it offers are mediocre platitudes about living a virtuous life, like some alternate-dimension edition of The Eight Habits of Highly Virtuous People.\r\rYoda said it better.\r\rAn urn containing Shamino's ashes apparently has found its way to the Codex, though. It appears there and at every shrine--a constant reminder of my failure. Thanks, Codex.\rI almost want to find out what happens if I keep going back to Blackthorn's and getting characters executed. Do I get a whole line of urns?\r\rI'm getting very, very sick of sea battles. I don't have much in the way of missile weapons, so I have to pelt the monsters with slings or wait  until they deign to come within striking distance of one of the ship's openings. Unlike land battles, there's no way to escape. I've lost a few characters that way, and resurrection is expensive. On the other hand, sharks are an experience gimme. They have no missile attack, so I can hand a sling to my least experienced character and take them out one by one with no danger to myself.\rSharks are an experience freebee.\r\r On some island keep, a Lord Segallion, an ex-pirate, gave me a spyglass so I could track the planets and comets at any time.Like the lighthouse with the two strange keepers, a few of the other keeps have baffled me a bit. One was called Windmere, and seemed to be populated with a bunch of people loyal to Blackthorn, but I couldn't get anything useful out of them. There was a sign outside the keep warning of \"rodents of unusual size.\" I looked it up, and The Princess Bride predates Ultima V by a year. That surprised me. Ultima V feels older.\rWhen I go to healers, they should tell me that my characters are only \"mostly dead.\"\r\r I have information about where to find the Shard of Cowardice and the Shard of Falsehood. I'm just not 100% sure what to do with them when I find them, nor where to find the Shard of Hatred.\rSo I'm still stuck on the scepter and the crown jewels and the shard, but rather than go around asking everyone about them randomly, I'm going to explore the dungeons, gain some levels, cast some spells, and earn enough money for some magic axes. I have three postings half-written about dungeons, combat, and magic, and I want some more experience with all of them before I put them out. After that, I suppose it will be time for a second overland voyage, picking up any clues I've missed and visiting any towns and keeps I haven't already found (I'm sure there are some, but I need more gems to fully explore).\r\rDespite my misgivings about the order in which I've done things, the game really is a joy. As I said in a comment a few days ago, I think it's the pinnacle of the isometric, tile-based genre, in both the variety of terrain (indoors and outdoors), objects, and the ways you can interact with them. [Later edit: my use of \"isometric\" was incorrect here. See comments.] The NPCs are also fairly amazing for the era. In most games of the time, you have barely any interaction with NPCs, and when you do, they're always found in the same place. Here we have NPCs that keep daily schedules and who are crucial to your understanding of the game world and the main quest. Both Richard Garriott and Origin had some clunkers, but they never stopped innovating."}, {"title": "Ultima V: Raid on Blackthorn's", "date": "Tuesday, August 30, 2011", "text": "Absolutely nothing happened to me after this exchange. Maybe I was just too fast on the magic carpet.\r\rI didn't mean to hit Blackthorn's palace so soon, but I was on my way to the Island of the Abyss, and then suddenly there it was. I figured the worst that would happen was I'd wake up in Lord British's castle again. As it turns out, with the magic carpet--which moves faster than the guards--I was able to get in, get Lord British's crown, and leave quite easily. In the meantime, I freed a bunch of prisoners, collected an NPC named Gorn, and talked to Blackthorn himself.\r\rAfter I got through it the first time, I actually quit without saving just so I could do it again and make a video of it. You can see the result below. The video also highlights a bunch of gameplay elements.\r\r\r\rAt the end of the video, I decide to attack Blackthorn just to see what happens. First, when I attack what I assume is Blackthorn sitting on his throne, it turns out to be his jester! Then, when I hit Blackthorn in his chambers, he and his daemons slaughter me almost instantly. I remember from playing previously that he's an unkillable character, so I'm not overly upset; I just wanted to see what would happen.\r\rBlackthorn's chef is unpleasant.\r\rAfter reloading, I skedaddled and went to the Island of the Abyss, where I learned a lesson about honesty--as if I needed it.\r\rAll right, fine. My name isn't really \"Chet.\"\r\rIn quick succession after Blackthorn's, I hit Jhelom, Buccaneer's Den, New Magincia, the Lycaeum, Cove, Empath Abbey (again), Greyhaven lighthouse (again), and Blackthorn's castle (again--I found out a clue later on that the prisoner Hassad had a Word of Power).\r\rSome quests and items along the way:\r\rI now have the names of the three Shadowlords: Astaroth (hatred), Nosfentor (cowardice), and Faulinei (falsehood). Lord Shalineth suggests that knowing these names somehow gives me power over them, although I'm not sure how.Each of the Shadowlords is apparently associated with some kind of shard. I have a line on where to find two of them in the underworld (including coordinates), but not exactly what to do with them if I find them.\r\rI also have the Words of Power for seven of the eight dungeons. I'm not even sure what the eighth dungeon is, frankly. But I got each of them from the associated council members--the last was Hassad, in Blackthorn's castle, who I encountered on my first visit but didn't know he had a Word of Power until someone told me in New Magincia. My return trip to Blackthorn's had some pretty bad consequences, which I cover below.I have the eight mantras (which I still had from Ultima IV anyway), but I still have to meditate at each of the shrines and apparently visit the Island of the Abyss after each meditation. That's going to get tedious.Just as I was wondering where I was going to find the sextant in this game, a guy in Buccaneer's Den told me that David, the lighthouse keeper in Greyhaven, had it. David gave it to me without a fuss after I complimented him on it.\r\rA pirate in Buccaneer's Den told me that he heard of glass swords hidden somewhere in Serpent's Spine, the mountain range north of Lord British's castle. At first, I wasn't sure how I was going to get up on the mountains (there doesn't seem to be a balloon in this game), but then I heard about a grapple that allows you to climb over mountains. Someone told me that Lord Michael in Empath Abbey had it, and in short order I got it from him and, with the help of some gems, found the glass sword. My recollection about glass swords is that they do a lot of damage but shatter on the first hit, so I'd better save it for something special. (K)limbing through mountains with the grapple, incidentally, makes you take damage every move, so I won't be using it a lot.\r\rFrom a mad wizard in Jhelom, I got a clue that when moongates disappear, I can search and get moonstones at those locations and move the moongates to new places. I guess that would help me get out of the underworld or something, although for role-playing reasons I'm wary about moving the moongate locations around. People use those! I don't want some guy traveling from Britain to Moonglow suddenly surrounded by mongbats.\rThis guy has this schtick where he talks backwards.\rIn New Magincia, where almost all the NPCs oddly had Asian names, I found my old companion Katrina. She had been a humble shepherd in Ultima IV before I apparently ruined her:\rViolence begets violence, Katrina.\r\r\rAs I mentioned above, when I went back to Blackthorn's some unpleasant things happened. I got the Word of Power from Hassad, but then I accidentally ran into a guard. Instead of giving me a chance to fight, the game just said I was bound and shackled and blindfolded. Pretty soon, Blackthorn showed up and ordered me released, claiming he was seeking Avatarhood. He wanted to know the mantra for the Shrine of Honesty. I wasn't about to tell him.\r\r\rFurious, he had his guards grab Shamino and put his head on a guillotine or something. Three more times, he demanded the mantra. This was a fairly difficult role-playing choice for me, as Shamino is a good fighter and...well, he's Shamino, for god's sake. He's in every Ultima game. He was one of my original companions in Ultima IV. But I stuck to my guns, hoping Blackthorn was bluffing. Unfortunately...\r\rNnnnnnooooooooooo!\r\rThat unbelievable bastard. Even worse, he stole my magic carpet! Now I have to walk around like a caveman. He tossed my party back in prison, but I managed to pick my way free and get out of his castle, minus one stalwart companion and one handy traveling device.\r\rNice use of a Goethe quote.\r\rMy last \"to do\" before doing the shrine quests and exploring the dungeons in earnest (I still have to save up enough for magic axes) is to visit Sir Simon's place \"west of Spiritwood.\" I couldn't find it in my first pass, but I suspect it might be surrounded by mountains and I need the grapple to get there. I also need to collect two new party members--I'd ditched Gorn at some inn, and of course I lost Shamino. I figure I need at least one solid spellcaster, so I might return to Yew and pick up Jaana."}, {"title": "Ultima V: World Tour", "date": "Monday, August 29, 2011", "text": "Thanks for getting my hopes up, Nikolaj.\r\rAboard my magic carpet, I decided to follow up on my clues, visit the major towns, and see the world, hopefully earning enough money from random encounters to buy a frigate and start hitting the Island of the Abyss.\r\rI started heading for the eastern desert, but I popped into a lighthouse called Waveguide and encountered this guy:\r\r\rNo one who says \"in the name of Mondain\" (the very evil villain from the first Ultima) can be a particularly good fellow. He didn't have much to say except to yell at me, and his wife was practically catatonic, like Chris Cooper's wife in American Beauty. A sad little side trip.\r\rIn the eastern desert, much sooner than I expected, I found the hut of the daemon who supposedly knows something about the Shadowlord of Hatred. I found him working in a field.\r\r\rNow, I want to be clear here because I think Ultima VI or Ultima VII does a major retcon on this character. He's a daemon. There's no question about it. He has the daemon icon. If I attack him, he's capable of summoning other daemons and possessing me. If I (l)ook at him, it says \"thou dost see a daemon.\" Got it? He's a daemon. Not anything else.\r\rAnyway, he says that he served evil until Lord British apparently did a reverse-Stockholm Syndrome on him, and he made his way to the surface to be a farmer. None of my prodding got him to tell me where Lord British actually is. He gave me the name of the Shadowlord of Hatred--Astaroth (which traces somehow to Babylonian mythology)--but warned me not to yell it.\r\rFrom there I went to Moonglow, partly because it's the first city in the order of virtues and partly because I had a clue to ask someone named Malik about swords of glass (\"it was a passable game to which thou didst not give enough of a chance\"). While there, I chanced upon Lord Stuart the Hungry, who had a \"create food\" spell that he gave me. I found Malik, just a kid (not a Sith lord), and he sent me on to a pirate in Buccaneer's Den for the glass sword clue. His grandmother, a fortune teller, told me where to find Blackthorn's Castle, the Word of Power for the Dungeon Deceit, and the Mantra of Honesty. The developers got a little lazy on this one.\r\rA guy in a tower in the center of town cleared up my question about the stars and comets. (judgemonroe gave me the clue in a comment yesterday, too.) The stars represent the eight towns, the three comets represent the Shadowlords, and looking at the firmament tells me which Shadowlords are in which towns. Since the worst you have to do is wait a day if they're present, I'm not sure what this information does for me--unless I need it to go hunting them later. Anyway, when I gave the wizard the Resistance password, he sent me on to a mage named Goeth in Jhelom to ask about a new \"power of the moongates.\"\r\rLeaving Moonglow, I decided to go along the north coast of Britannia, stopping in Minoc before turning south to Skara Brae and Sir Simon (someplace \"west of Spiritwood\"). I'll spare you a blow-by-blow account of all of the towns, but here are some highlights from the cities and my wilderness exploration:\r\rAll of the towns are in the same locations as Ultima IV, but there are a lot more places to explore. IV had eight towns, three keeps, Lord British's castle, and I think three hamlets (oddly, Vesper is gone in V, or I somehow missed it). V has almost all those plus a bunch of lighthouses, huts, castles, and new villages. I like finding new things in familiar territory.The game doesn't do a great job of it, partly because there isn't quite enough dialogue and it's not subtle, but it accurately portrays how some people, even \"good\" people, can come to support tyranny. We have a healer in Minoc, for instance, who praises Blackthorn for instituting martial law--it's cut down on factional skirmishes that leave people injured. A mayor likes the new laws for their unambiguity. Complexity and nuance are the enemies of tyranny.A frigate will run me 1121 gold. I found this out from Captain Blythe in Minoc, who works his two apprentices 7 days a week making sails. One of them gave me the mantra of sacrifice, and her mother Fiona, who runs the poor house, knew the Word of Power for the Dungeon Covetous.\rI pictured her looking like Fiona from \"Burn Notice.\"\r\rA beggar in Minoc, after I gave him a bunch of gold, told me that the armorer had been going about town at noon looking shifty. So I followed him and watched him dither around by a tree. Searching the tree after he left, I found \"5 odd keys.\" Apparently, they open magic locks. I bought 5 more from a chef in Serpent's Hold.Like Ultima IV and Might & Magic, the game map wraps back around on itself, which makes no sense unless the world is a cube (and even then it might make no sense; I'm having trouble visualizing properly).I found Iolo's hut again and talked to Smith, and got the joke where he told me about INFINITY. Dumb horse.\r\rIn Skara Brae, I found Froed, whose father, Greymarch, I had met in the jail in Yew. I returned to Yew to tell Greymarch, who gave me a clue about Lord British's sceptre, which apparently has protective powers. I need to find Sir Simon (who I was already looking for) to ask about it.\rLord British finally showed up at night and raised me a level.\r\rAt some point, I realized that the Ultima IV classes no longer apply. I am an \"Avatar\"; Shamino is a fighter instead of a ranger; Iolo and Gwenno are bards, so that's cool; but Julia is also a bard instead of a tinker.Toshi wasn't doing anything for me, so I dumped him at the inn in Skara Brae. At the same inn, I met Saul, who told me where to find mandrake and nightshade (same places as in Ultima IV). Oddly, though, these reagents are for sale at shops now. You don't have to find them in the wild.I have a pocket watch that tells me the time (it's more precise than watching the sun at the top of the screen). I just noticed.Blackthorn is seeking the mantras to the shrines so he can destroy them. This from a guy named Kindor who was nearly killed by Shadowlords.In Serpent's Hold, I met a manacled prisoner who claimed he helped build Blackthorn's castle. He said it was full of traps.I started hearing about \"shards.\" This vaguely rings a bell from the time I played the game as a teenager. Apparently, there are three of them--one for each Shadowlord--located somewhere in the Underworld. A guy in Serpent's Hold said he had a vision about where to find one of them.\rThat is one specific vision.\r\rMonsieur Loubet, the fencing master of Serpent's Hold, gave me the clue that was probably supposed to start my quest for the magic carpet. He said he arrived in Britannia on one as a child, then sold it to a mage named Bandaii in Paws (who first gave me the clue). He was oblivious to the fact that I was, in fact, riding his magic carpet during the entire conversation.\r\rEventually, I decided I had seen all of the world that I could see from my magic carpet, so I decided to head into the Dungeon Covetous, which is about six steps from Minoc, until I had enough gold to return to Minoc and get my frigate. The dungeon had an undead theme, and it took about two hours to get the necessary gold, but when I was done, the world was open to me.\r\r\rNext stops: Buccaneer's Den, New Magincia, the Island of the Abyss, Jhelom, and that island where Sir Simon is."}, {"title": "Ultima V: You Don't Know What We Can See", "date": "Sunday, August 28, 2011", "text": "Fantasy will set you free.\r\rI did the coolest and stupidest things today. While dithering around trying to think about exactly what to do next, I decided to head back to Lord British's castle and see about that magic carpet I had been told about. I figured it would be in his private chambers on the top of the castle. When I got there, the guard that had thrown me off a few days ago was gone, but I found that the door was surrounded by a magic lock. I read in the manual that the IN EX POR spell would defeat such locks, but although I had the reagents to mix some, I didn't have enough levels to cast it.\r\r\rJust as I was about to leave, I took notice of a cannon on the ramparts south of me. On a whim, I tried pushing it, and I found I could move it away from the ramparts and towards the door. One shot, and...\r\rGod, I love cannons.\r\rEntering the chambers, I was able to (g)et the magic carpet in the doorway, which provides me transportation around mainland Britain faster than any horse, a way across swamps, and coastal transportation easier than a skiff. Awesome! And all because of a chance encounter in Paws.\r\rBut that's not all. Inside Lord British's chambers, I found a harpsichord, and remembering that Kenneth (from the lighthouse) had told me that \"Stones\" is Lord British's favorite song, I looked to my notes for the sequence and gave it a play. This caused the screen to shake and a secret door to open in the northern part of the chamber. Inside was a \"sandalwood box.\" I forgot exactly what it's for, but I do remember I need it for the end of the game.\r\r\rThe fireplace in the room held--predictably--a secret passage behind it, and I decided it wasn't \"stealing\" to take stuff from Lord British's chambers specifically to rescue him, so I got a scroll of AN TYM (negate time) and a black potion (don't know what it does).\r\rJust as I was congratulating myself for a game well-played, guess what happened. I decided to (k)limb up to the rooftop using the ladder. There's a telescope there, and at nightfall I was able to see a bunch of planets and comets or something. I'm not 100% sure what this is telling me:\r\r\rHeading downstairs, I found that...goddamn it. The door is magically locked again. Remember what I said yesterday about levels re-setting when you go up and down? I didn't have a cannon inside the room, and I was no more capable of casting IN EX POR than five minutes earlier. Even if I was willing to reload a saved game, I couldn't--for some reason, I had chosen to save it on the roof.\r\rThus, I made the worst decision for my party that I have ever made in a CRPG: I stood in the fireplace until all of my characters burned to death. Just imagine what that must have been like for them.\r\r\rWe awoke, shrieking and traumatized for life, in Lord British's throne room. Again. Is there any maximum for these things?\r\rBut, anyway, wheee! I have a magic carpet. (It seems a little unfair that I got to keep it.)\r\rSomething...something...calamari...something. Look, I just died in a fire, all right?\r\rAfter that, I decided it was time to spend some serious effort restoring my lost experience (I think I have less than when I started the game), equipment, and food. Xyzzy suggested yesterday that I do that by visiting dungeons instead of grinding against bridge trolls, so I thought I'd give it a try. I had Words of Power for both Despise and Wrong, and I remembered from Ultima IV that Despise was in the mountains north of Britain. With a little exploration and a couple of gems, I found it and (y)elled the Word of Power to open it up.\r\r\rI'll spend more time talking about the dungeons later. For now, I'll just note that the dungeon textures are much better than in the previous game--though still not up to the quality of, say, Dungeon Master. A plaque near the entrance proclaimed that I was in \"THE MAZE OF LOST SOULS.\" Ooooh. Anyway, long story short: the dungeon had virtually nothing in it except pits that I kept falling down, bats (who give you no treasure), and gremlins (who steal your food). No rooms or treasure chests or anything.\r\r\rSo after stocking up on food to replace what the gremlins stole, I took my magic carpet north to the coast above Yew to find the dungeon Wrong. On the way, I popped by the Shrine of Justice and meditated. I didn't realize that this game doesn't require you to find the runes before using the shrines. After meditating, I was given a quest to go to the Codex and \"learn of the weakness of the unjust.\"\r\rI'm the Avatar! Why do I have to prove myself all over again?\r\rThe Dungeon Wrong was completely different than Despise. Instead of a \"cavern\" texture, it had more of a \"dungeon\" texture--bricks instead of cave walls, with skeletons hanging from manacles. There were rooms in this dungeon, and they had a kind-of \"jail\" theme. I soon found that, unlike Ultima IV, dungeon rooms in Ultima V do not respawn--at least, not while you're still in the dungeon. Many of the rooms offered good opportunities for level grinding--especially the ones that allowed me to attack through windows with missile weapons, while the enemies just sat there helplessly. By using the feature to \"set active character,\" I could ensure that the character who most needed the experience points got them.\r\rLike shooting rats in a locked jail cell.\r\rThe dungeon stopped being fun when I nearly got beat up by some ghosts, so I returned to the surface to camp and see if I could increase in levels. I'm pretty sure that the apparition of Lord British takes care of that when he appears, but he didn't show up the first night I tried it.\r\rI might spend a little more time in Wrong and then start making my rounds of the towns and following up on leads.\r\rToday, I did part of my playing on an airplane, and the guy next to me--he seemed about 20--was utterly baffled as to why I would play a game so old. I tried to suggest that it was no different than watching old movies, or listening to old songs, but he clearly didn't do that sort of thing, either, so I had to give up."}, {"title": "Ultima V: Towns and Their Folk", "date": "Saturday, August 27, 2011", "text": "The adventurers arrive in town in time for a Tea Party rally.After my underworld fiasco, I traveled overland to Yew, the City of Justice, to seek out information on the Resistance (I'd received a hint in one of the little Brittany towns). To replenish some equipment, finances, and experience, I ground against some bridge trolls along the way. (The game makes it easy to find combats by just standing on a bridge and holding down the spacebar.) Opening a chest and finding a whole pile of treasure and items, instead of just gold, makes combat in this game very satisfying.Ultima V offers a succinct and perfect description of CRPGs: \"Some torches! A ring of keys! A sack of gold! A weapon! A weapon!\"But when I got to Yew, a Shadowlord--likely whichever one is associated with falsehood--was hanging around, and he chased me as soon as I saw him. I fled the town with the Shadowlord hot on my heels. I figured the Shadowlord wasn't always in town--I would have remembered that from the last time I played the game--so I decided to go wandering around for a while until he disappeared. He was gone by the next morning, but the Shadowlord of Cowardice was there instead. Annoyed, I stalked off for Empath Abbey for the day.Empath Abbey, as you may remember from Ultima IV, is one of three keeps dedicated to the principles of virtue: truth, love, and courage. In the courtyard, one of my wishes came true:One of the few things I remember about this game from childhood.In the Abbey, a small man named Toshi offered to join me; after he did, he turned out to be a bard, bringing my current bard complement to 3. A little while later, I found Julia the tinker, one of my companions from the previous game, in the same place. She joined and brought my party to its maximum of six.A cook named Cory hand-fed me some fried shark and squid au poivre.The Avatar discovers muffulettas.A jester named Hardluck sang a song about Blackthorn, suggesting he was once a good man whose soul was corrupted by Shadowlords, but I remain skeptical. Lord Michael, the castle's ruler, told me that a daemon living in the eastern desert knows of the Shadowlord of Hatred. After finishing my exploration of the keep, I mounted my horse (which made overland travel a bit faster) and made my way to Yew.Yew is the City of Justice and, as such, has Britannia's court and prison. Upon arrival, I was a little distressed to see this sign:Little do they know if they get me dead, I'll just resurrect in Lord British's castle.Blackthorn and the Shadowlords are not happy that my old friends managed to summon me here. Clearly, justice has gone awry in Yew, so I had no compunction using some keys to jimmy the locks on the prison doors and speak to the occupants. Because I want you to continue to have a sense of the dialogue, I'm going to transcribe a couple of conversations:You see a sorely beaten fighter.NAME: \"My name is Greymarch.\"JOB: \"I once sought adventure on the open range!\"ADVENTURE: \"I've been sitting in this cell now for quite some time, with no word from my son.\"SON: \"I fear Froed was killed by the wicked guards that threw me in here!\"FROED: \"My son! Hast thou seen him?\"NO: \"Then why taunt me?\"After talking with Greymarch, I freed the poor prisoner in the manacles next to him, earning me (I  hope),  a boost in virtue.You see a quiet, solitary man. \"I am called Jerone.\"JOB: \"Well, I used to be an adventurer!\"ADVENTURER: \"Now I'm a prisoner!\"PRISONER: \"I was convicted of heresy!\"HERESY: \"I stated my belief that Lord British was alive!\"BELIEF: \"It happened one night when I was camping out on the moors.\"CAMPING: \"A strange apparition arose before my fire!\"APPARITION: \"It was HIM, I swear it!!! Surely thou dost believe me?\"YES: \"Then surely thou must agree, there is hope! If only my brother would hurry!\"BROTHER: \"He is collecting the 500 gold crowns needed for my release.\"RELEASE: \"He used to give me keys, but I kept getting caught!\"KEYS: \"I'm sure if thou woudst ask he wouldst give thee a key. He comes by around ten each morning and evening.\"BYE: \"I'm sure we'll see more of each other.\"Later, I met his brother, Jeremy, donated 30 gold crowns to his cause, and got a key from him, and found that Chamfort knows the Mantra of Justice.A barely-perceptible break in the wall pattern behind his bed revealed a secret door.In the third cell, I met a former Great Council member, Felespar, who had participated in the sealing of the eight dungeons. I asked him about the Word of Power to open it, but when he asked if I was with the Resistance, I had to say no (not yet). On the way out, I encountered the Head Inquisitor, Judge Dryden, who asked if I was here to confess or plead for the release of a prisoner. I gave him the names of each of the prisoners, but he insisted they \"deserve no pity!\" Outside in the stocks was a child named Aleyn, who had been imprisoned such for failing to turn in his father for not donating enough to charity; nearby, his father, Mario, said that he could only afford 40%--the virtues have been twisted indeed. I jimmied the locks and set them free.As in Ultima IV, the towns, the NPCs, and their dialogue serve three major purposes: to inform you about the game world, to give you quests and clues, and to offer opportunities to display virtue (or lack thereof). I'm not entirely sure what role virtue and avatarhood play in this game, but they must play some role, or Lord British wouldn't keep assessing my progress when his apparition visits at night. Examples of \"bad\" things I could do in the towns are: lie about my name when asked, tell the jester I don't like his song, tell Greymarch I'd seen his son when I hadn't, tell Jerone I don't believe him, lie to Felespar about being with the Resistance, steal items from barrels and chests, or attack innocent townsfolk. This is all much like Ultima IV, of course, but this game is more expansive: more dialogue key words, more places to explore (and get in trouble), and more decisions to make.But I really need that potion!On to the main quest. Chamfort, the owner of the Arms of Justice, helped me in a couple of ways. One was to give me the Mantra of Justice (BEH); the other was to tell me of the Resistance. When I asked him, he demanded \"Who told thee to ask me?,\" and I had to consult my own blog entry for the name of the character who had given me that clue. I'm glad I was detailed. Once I convinced him I wanted to aid the Resistance, he sent me on to someone named Landon with a password: DAWN (not \"Dawn is breaking,\" fortunately). I had already met Landon in a secret passage behind the jail cells. There's a whole network of secret passages in Yew, including one behind a fireplace.In fact, there are enough secret passages behind fireplaces that you end up having to walk into every one, just to check.Landon told me that Blackthorn has personally seized Lord British's crown and keeps it in a small room on the top of his castle, and that I should recover it. Its powers apparently prevent the use of magic within the castle. He finished off by saying, \"Seek out Sir Simon on a mountain isle, west of Spiritwood,\" but I'm not sure why. Now, firmly with the Resistance, I returned to Felespar and got the Word of Power for the dungeon Wrong.Also in the Resistance stronghold, I met my old friend Jaana, who couldn't join because my party was full (I'm not really sure how to ditch someone). I finished up my trip to Yew by buying some more reagents at Madam Pendra's (the game doesn't give you the option to pay whatever you want, as in IV), and selling my extra arms and armor. I found a weapon to save up for:My horse had disappeared at some point when I went down a ladder, so I exited Yew on foot and began thinking about my next steps.A few gameplay notes relating to towns and people:You frequently encounter locked doors in the game, which you can open by \"jimmying\" them with a key. If it works, you get to keep the key; if not, the key breaks. The same process works for disarming trapped chests after a battle. I assume success is related to the dexterity of the character. There are also magically-locked doors, surrounded by a blue glow, and I don't know how to unlock those yet.I can see into this cell because the door has a little window. Look carefully in the wall above the pillow on the bed for the secret door. Also note the difference in icon between the unlocked door (in front of me) and the locked ones (on either side). Finally, see the trap door and grating south of me. I can go down through both methods, but only one doesn't hurt.As mentioned above, there are secret doors hidden in walls  and represented by tiny breaks in the brick lines. Sometimes you have to (p)ush furniture or plants out of the way to get to them, and then you have to (s)earch to find them. There are also secret passages behind fireplaces.You can sleep in any bed--it's not like Oblivion where you can't sleep in \"owned beds.\" However, if the bed does have an owner, he'll show up and boot you out at his bedtime.Characters in the towns follow a day/night cycle more complex than in most modern CRPGs. (I was just playing Dragon Age: Origins and noting that it never gets dark, and nothing ever closes.) Not only do NPCs go home at night and then get up and go to work in the morning, they take lunch breaks! Some of them show up at places at very specific times, such as Jeremy, who visits his brother at morning and night and spends the rest of the time in the kitchen of the local restaurant. And some are nocturnal. Functionally, this means that I have to wander around town a few times if I want to be sure I get to talk to everyone. Also, shops close at night and towns bar their entrances--you don't want to get stuck in a town after dark unless you intend to stay.There are multiple levels to most towns and castles, accessible via ladders, stairs, trap doors, and gratings. Leaving one level for another causes the first to \"reset\"--anything you've pushed out of the way gets put back, all unlocked doors are re-locked, and your horse disappears.The game has fun with different viewpoints. Torches cast light only on certain parts of corridors; windows offer views outside or inside, but only when standing next to them; and balconies will show you a snapshot of what's below.Looking out a second floor window onto the courtyard at night.I'm not sure exactly what to do next. It seems a bit early to try to infiltrate Lord Blackthorn's castle, so I suspect I'll start working through the towns in some kind of order. I still have to figure out what role the virtues, mantras, and shrines play in this game, and I still don't know how to level up."}, {"title": "Ultima V: Into the Underworld", "date": "Friday, August 26, 2011", "text": "Yes, I know it's too early for me to be here. It's called \"role-playing.\"\r\rThe Ultima V manual has a journal kept by \"Remoh\" (read it backwards), the scribe to Lord British. It describes the journey that Lord British undertook to the underworld, accompanied by knights named Arinois, Meridin, Geraci, Shaana, Noin, and Roin. The journal describes how they reached the underworld by following a river east of Spiritwood and plunging down a waterfall, and it gives detailed directions of their path once they reached the first underworld cavern.\r\rThe narrative describes assorted horrors that assailed the party, generally accompanied by Lord British kicking some serious ass--something he never does in any of the other Ultima games. One by one, the knights fell until only Lord British, Shaana, and Rehom were left. Then the three Shadowlords arrived, blasted British unconscious, and hauled him away. The fates of Shaana and Rehom are unknown, as is the method by which the journal reached the surface.\r\rThe obvious thing for my Avatar, Invictus, to do would be to retrace the expedition's steps and see if he can find any clues, or even Lord British himself. I don't fancy getting stuck down there, but it'll be ages before I have a character with enough spell points to cast \"gate travel,\" so I'll have to take my chances.\r\rTo follow the path, I first needed to buy a skiff, so I spent a little time grinding against bridge trolls until I had the 175 gold to afford it. Their loot also provided a decent supply of weapons, food, and keys. When I had about 500 gold, I bought the skiff from Hawkwind in East Brittany and stocked up on rations in Britain.\r\r\rI had this idea that I could carry the skiff with me, but I guess not in this game, so I boarded it for a long trip south, around the cape, and back north to the mouth of the River Maelstrom. The skiff, I soon discovered, is only good in light coastal waters. If you try to take it into deep water, the game tells you \"rough seas!\" and you lose a bunch of hit points.\r\rI stopped in Paws on the way south, where I patronized an inn owned by the enigmatic \"Dr. Cat,\" a figure who appears in a little more detail in later games and is based on a real-life programmer. I bought some torches at the guild, but keys, at 3 for 224 gold, were too dear. An adventurer named Glinkie told me that he thought the Shrine of Spirituality was destroyed (in Ultima IV, you could only find it by entering moongates at when the moons were full). Just for the heck of it, I searched a random tree stump and found a ring of invisibility.\r\r\rA mage in a field of horses was looking for Smith, and when I told him that he could find Smith at Iolo's place, he \"rewarded\" me by telling me that I could find a magic flying carpet in Lord British's chambers at the top of the castle (the place the guard evicted me from yesterday). I briefly considered going back and trying it, but I figure I need some more resources for that kind of caper.\r\rThen I made the mistake of stopping in Trinsic, a walled city. The gates closed at night, and a guard demanded a 40-gold-piece tribute to Lord Blackthorn, which I refused. Then he demanded my arrest, which I also refused. That didn't work out so well for my party:\r\r\"You should have paid the fine!\"\r\rWaking up in Lord British's castle again, I vowed to be more careful in towns at night. I walked back to Trinsic, picked up my skiff, and continued south.\r\rUltima V has a lot more little keeps and houses to explore than its predecessor, and I soon found myself in a lighthouse called Greyhaven. A poor confused boy was studying Blackthorn's version of the eight virtues, and when I told him they wouldn't make him an Avatar, he told me to piss off. In the keep was the fugitive royal coinmaker, Sir Arbuthnot, who apparently minted the codex coin that called me to Britannia in the first place.\r\rNamed after John Arbuthnot, or Arbuthnot & Co., a mercantile bank in India?\r\rAlso living in the lighthouse was the court composer, Sir Kenneth, who taught me Britannian musical notation, which is similar to standard western musical notation except that the staff has only four lines. The notes corresponded with numbers from 1-9, and I was able to sit in front of a harpsichord and play a little bit--if you watch the video with sound, you may recognize the tune. Afterwards, I wandered around the lighthouse a bit and then went to bed. Lord British appeared in my dreams and healed everyone, which was nice of him.\r\r\r\rAt last, I made my way around the cape, up the west coast of Britannia, down the River Maelstrom. I plunged down the waterfall shown at the beginning of this screen capture and landed in the underworld, in the middle of a small lake. I ignited one of my few torches, noting that the game started me with enough sulfurous ash for about 6 \"light\" spells.\r\rFrom here, I started following the directions in Remoh's journal. He noted landing his skiff on the western shore of the cavern and erecting a sign, which I soon found:\r\rI'm starting to re-develop the ability to translate runes without referring to the documentation: \"HEREUPON BEGAN THE QUEST OF HIS MAJESTY LORD BRITISH TO EXPLORE AND CHART THE NEW UNDERWORLD ON 11/27/137.\"\r\rI continued following the directions down a couple of rivers, winning battles with sea serpents along the way, though at considerable damage. Other creatures I was able to outrun. My party started to wonder if visiting the underworld was really a good idea, given that, you know, Lord British couldn't make it.\r\rOn the southern shore of a lake, I found Lord British's party's skiff, right where the journal said they abandoned it:\r\r\"If we ever return to Britannia,\" says the journal, \"It will not be by retracing our steps.\"\r\rBeasts began attacking me. Giant rats weren't so hard:\r\r\rBut a group of mongbats was so large as to be ridiculous. I had to flee, probably taking a hit to my valor. I found myself having to camp a lot to heal.\r\r\rI had several fights with regular bats who were as numerous but not so hard, and I dared hope I was racking up experience points (although I don't quite yet know how to level up).\r\rAt length I came to a large cavern in which almost every square was swamp, which of course poisons your characters. Poisoned characters lose 2 hit points with every action. The game started me with a reserve of AN NOX spells, but there was no point using them to cure characters who were going to just get poisoned again two steps later. I carefully made my way across the cavern, using AN NOX and MANI (healing) sparingly, and I reached the other side nearly bereft of mixed spells, reagents, and spell points.\r\rHave I ever mentioned before how I feel about poison?\r\rFinally, nearly out of health and resources, I came to a cavern in which I found the remnants of Lord British's party. They encountered a battle against a legion of mongbats, and only three survived.\r\r\"Today the tree of us remaining buried the valient knights Arionis, Meridin, Geraci, Noin, and Roin, here upon the underground battlefield where they fell. Tomorrow we shall seek our way back to our own world; our disastrous quest here is finished.\"\r\rOn the battlefield was Lord British's amulet, which I took. I have no idea what it does. When I put it on, it made some kind of icon in the middle of the character stat screen. I searched the graves and found nothing. There were no other exits from the cavern.\r\rJust as I was about to start retracing my steps to see if I could find a way out of the underworld, an earthquake shook my characters down to their last few hit points, and I was attacked by dragons.\r\r\rAside from making devastating attacks, dragons can summon demons, who can in turn summon other demons and possess your party members. Moments later, I was resurrected in Lord British's throne room, minus 50 experience points for each character.\r\rI now know Lord British's fate, and I still have his amulet, but I face a difficult journey to restore my experience and repair the damage to my valor caused by running away from so many mongbats and other assorted beasts. Right now, my best bet seems to be to seek out the owner of the Arms of Justice in Yew and find out news about the Resistance.\r\rFrom now on, I'll highlight gameplay innovations as I continue my quest to rescue Lord British. Despite the limited amount of time I have to play it, I'm really enjoying this game."}, {"title": "Ultima V:  Starting Out", "date": "Wednesday, August 17, 2011", "text": "Lord British's castle doesn't just have Britain next door; it's surrounded by three other towns!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a couple of you pointed out in the comments to yesterday's  posting, Ultima V is quite difficult in the opening stages.  Shamino and Iolo summon the Avatar to help find Lord British and/or deal with Blackthorn. But after the initial arrival, there is no particular clue about where to go next. I could head off in any direction. And, as I've found, no matter what direction I choose, difficult encounters await along the way.There are eight major cities in Britannia and a smattering of hamlets and villages. I assume I'm going to have to visit them all eventually, but the Avatar wouldn't know that, and I decided to play it straight. For all my character knows, Lord British has already returned, or at least has sent word. It's not like we have cell phones in Britannia. Thus, the first place to check things out would be Lord British's castle.If you camp and set Iolo as the watch, he plays a little tune while you sleep. Unfortunately, the watch doesn't gain any hit points from the rest.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I played it smart this time and traveled only during the day, camping at night. This healed Shamino's wounds, which came in handy when we were beset by a large party of headless.We won, but at significant hit point losses. Already, this game seems a lot more difficult than IV, where combat was fairly easy and scaled to the level. Don't get me wrong--I like difficulty. I would also point out that enemy treasure chests--which are usually trapped--hold more than gold. I've found weapons, armor, food, gems, and keys in them as well.And the bridge trolls are back! Every time you cross a bridge, there's a chance you will disturb one or more trolls under it. They give you a chance to pay a fee to cross, but what kind of adventurer does that?My trek to Lord British's castle was hampered by my assumption as to my initial starting location. I have no idea why, but I assumed Iolo's hut was somewhere in the left-center of the continent, roughly south of Minoc. It turns out it's more in the western part, south of Yew. What I took for the shores of Loch Lake last night was actually the western sea. Ultimately, I figured it out and made my way to the castle, but by the time I reached it, each character only had 10-17 hit points. Iolo had been poisoned by a trap, but fortunately the game starts you off with enough reagents to mix a few spells, and I was able to cure him with an AN NOX.I explored as much of Lord British's castle as I could, talking to each character. Dialogue is unchanged from Ultima IV, which means I love it. Here are a couple of conversations with key characters.You see a young girl. \"I am called Treanna. What is thy name?\"INVICTUS: \"A pleasure!\"JOB: \"I am the stable girl.\"STABLE: \"Lord British's stables are home to many of the finest breeds in the land.\"BRITISH: \"Alas, he is no longer with us.\"BREEDS: \"We have prime examples of most of the major breeds. What's thy favorite breed?\"PAINT?: Never heard of that one, must be one of Blackthorn's new creations!\"(At this point, I checked out the manual, which actually mentions a number of breeds of horses, noting \"most stables deal in strong plough horses, rugged mountain horses, swift steppes horses, and a few even have Valorian steeds, which are most excellent war horses.\")PLOUGH: \"Well, they're well enough I suppose, but they hath not any true spirit!\"VALORIAN: \"Hey, mine too! Ever heard of a talking horse?\"YES: \"What was its name?\"SMITH: \"That's it! I have heard it lives in Iolo's barn, by his hut in the deep forest!\"I remembered Smith from Ultima IV, when he told me nothing useful. I didn't think to check around Iolo's hut for him before I went wandering out. I'll have to remember to check in on him. Maybe he'll say something interesting this time.Chuckles was dancing about the foyer, but didn't have anything to say but nonsense. Margaret, the upper kitchen chef, thinks Lord British is dead. Her daughter, Desiree, told me about Lord Stuart the Hungry, who travels around Britannia and eats until the castles evict him; apparently, he's working on a magic spell to create food (which of course I should ask him about if I encounter him).The throne room......was distressingly empty. There were several locked doors I couldn't open because I ran out of keys. There were a couple of magic doors that I don't quite yet know how to pass, including one in the Royal Prison, behind which a man named Drudgeworth insisted he \"didn't kill her\" and that Chuckles had him locked up.On the roof, I encountered a guard who threw me off:I will have to come back one of these days.In the basement, I encountered a shifty-eyed man named Saduj sleeping at the end of a maze of barrels. I waited for him to wake up and spoke to him. He insisted he was the gardener, but when I pressed him, he asked whether I was with \"the Oppression,\" but quickly claimed that he wasn't when I said \"no.\" Odd. All in all, an unproductive visit to the castle.Next to the Castle were three little towns named East, West, and North Brittany, along with the city of Britain. I figured I'd explore each and see what I could find out. I also had some troll spoils to sell. There were a lot of characters and shops in each town. Here are the more interesting things I discovered through conversation:Master Hawkins the shipwright has misplaced the plans for the HMS Cape, the fastest ship ever designed. One of his employees, Sir Adam the Torch, has discovered a way using gunpowder, sulfurous ash, and mandrake, to make ships go faster.Thentis, a farmer, questioning whether I liked Blackthorn's new laws, let a hint slip about \"the Resistance\" but wouldn't give me any more. Terrance in Britain also mentioned something about the Resistance and said I should ask the owner of the Arms of Justice. I assume that's in Yew.An adventurer named Grayson in Britain told me that the Codex is now guarded by a pair of winged stone guardians and that you have to be on a sacred quest to pass them and view the codex. Getting a sacred quest means meditating at the shrines of virtue with the mantra. The mantra of compassion is MU.I visited Iolo's bows in Britain, where I thought I might get a discount, considering--you know--Iolo is part of my party. But nothing doing. His wife, Gwenno, though, was happy to join me.In West Brittany, I met someone who deserved a slap, but the Avatar doesn't do such things:The character's name is Christopher, and I note that the author of Times of Lore is Chris Roberts.Eb, a busboy in Britain, who knows about fine glassware, told me to ask Malik in Moonglow about glass swords.Annon, a wizard of the Great Council, said that the Council used eight Words of Power to seal the eight dungeons. Blackthorn now wants to unlock the dungeons and let the evils within spring forth, so he's been hunting down council members. The Dungeon Despise can be unlocked with the word VILIS.None of that left me with much for the moment, so I need to think about my next step. The game manual has a journal from one of Lord British's companions that describes, in significant detail, the location where they descended into the underworld, and I think the Avatar would try to explore this location for clues next.I'll also note before I close that the runic alphabet, laid out in Ultima IV, is used to a much greater extent in this game. Many of the key words in conversation are rendered in the alphabet's code, and in one town, I found an entire graveyard with headstones in runic. I wasn't about to translate all of them.\"Tried to fly did poor young Tim. Fatal choice for a whim.\"The game really is a lot of fun, and I wish I had a good solid block of time to devote to it, but I'm stealing 15 minutes here, 20 there, from my crushing schedule. I'm going to work hard this week to ensure I have a nice long chunk of playing time this weekend."}, {"title": "Game 63: Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny (1988)", "date": "Monday, August 15, 2011", "text": "I'm not entirely sure why my character is wearing a turban, but I'm cool with that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ultima V: Warriors of DestinyUnited StatesORIGIN Systems (developer and publisher)Released 1988 for Apple II, DOS, and Commodore 128; 1989 for Atari ST and Commodore 64; 1990 for Amiga, PC-88, PC-98, and Sharp X68000; 1992 for FM Towns; 1993 for NESRemade and re-released as shareware in 1993Date Started: 15 August 2011\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Starting Ultima V was one of the most satisfying moments I've experienced in months of CRPG playing. It feels like coming home. You would think that it would be boring to play a series of four games (Ultimas IV-VII) in the same game world, but instead I find it enormously rewarding. Each game offers new hamlets, keeps, and dungeons to explore--not to mention cities that change over time--and yet you have comfortable familiarity with the the overall landscape. I don't know what I'm going to encounter in between, but I know how to get from Britain to Trinsic. Sometimes there's as much fun in exploring what's changed as there is in exploring what's new.\"When Britannia first, at Lord British's command, arose from out the azure main...\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is particularly notable given that horrid things tend to happen to Britannia's world in between games. In Ultima I, the world was a collection of islands, but then there was a fused land mass in Ultima III (there was no Ultima II)--a land mass that looks nothing like the Britannia introduced in Ultima IV. The manuals explain these changes via tales of violent earthquakes, upheavals, and tsunamis following the deaths of Mondain and Exodus. (You wonder if it wouldn't have been better--all things considered--if the tyrants had just been allowed to rule.)When we last left Ultima IV, 14 months ago, I had become the Avatar of Virtue, braved the Stygian Abyss, and uncovered the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom--just before Lord British unceremoniously drop-kicked me back through the moongate to my own world. I groused about that at the time, but I suppose expecting a parade or statue or whatever would show unforgivable pride. I'd have lost an eighth, and then Lord British would be back where he started, without an Avatar. This way, Britannia gets to say farewell to its idol before he has a chance to fall.Between the game and the manual, we get a pretty cool main quest setup. On Earth, I awake in the middle of the night to a codex symbol shimmering over my bed, which resolves into an amulet. Figuring this for a sign, I leap out of bed, grab my ankh, and head for the circle of stones where the moongate first appeared prior to Ultima IV. Sure enough, another one pops up, and I jump through, arriving in Britannia looking pretty badass, if I do say so myself.Notice how I don't even turn my head at the bolt of lightning.I end up in a clearing. Shamino--my spiritual ranger companion from Ultima IV--comes dashing up, going on about worrying that the summoning wouldn't work, and someone named Blackthorn. Suddenly, these three guys that looke like Ghosts of Christmas Yet to Come appear. Shamino yells \"Shadowlords!\" just in time to get a magic bolt to the chest.\"I promise I shall keep Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year!\"I show my amulet and they fade away. I carry Shamino to a nearby hut, which turns out to be Iolo's. (This, in the 1980s, was the first time most players realized that Iolo was a man.) Iolo tells me what's going on: After the events of Ultima IV, Lord British had the dungeons sealed and the Codex raised from the Abyss, which apparently caused some kind of cataclysm below, leaving a vast cavernous area populated by horrid monsters. Some explorers came back with tales of dark creatures, so Lord British--for some reason--decided to personally lead an expedition into the underworld, and he was either captured or killed. His regent, Blackthorn, took over and became corrupted by the three mysterious Shadowlords. A tyrant, he has outlawed my companions from the previous game and introduced a perverted, draconian form of the eight virtues, with creeds such as \"thou shalt not lie, or that shalt lose thy tongue\" and \"thou shalt humble thyself to thy superiors, or thou shalt suffer their wrath.\" Shamino and Iolo decided to summon me to rescue Lord British and end Blackthorn's evil reign.This story--told in well-illustrated cut-scenes--is delightfully mirrored at the bottom of the main screen, using the actual icons and textures of the game. It's so cool in fact, that I'm going to let you watch it below.I love the resoluteness with which I head to my chest and grab my sword and shield (00:32), and then pause to check myself in the mirror on the way out the door (00:49). The game is still tile-based, but the tiles are much more artistically composed than in IV (more on graphics later). At 01:28 we get the first hint of the sound in the game--the pattering of the waterfall--and while it's not great, I'm not going to turn it off, either. I'm not sure why Shamino looks like a pirate and Iolo looks like a Sikh, but what the heck, I value diversity.We have to pause here to consider Lord Blackthorn. I didn't meet this fellow in Ultima IV, so it's a little odd that he's somehow risen to become the king of Britannia. I wish the creators had used an established character. Moreover....\"Blackthorn?\" Seriously? Lord British needs to form a support group with King \"Let's-hire-an-advisor-named-Grima-Wormtongue\" Theoden.I wanted to transfer my Ultima IV character over, but since I last played that game, I somehow overwrote the file. No idea how that happened. So I created a new character from scratch. The game takes you through the same Gypsy-fortune-telling character-creation process as in the previous game, this time as a \"memory\" of what happened prior. The Gypsy woman asked slightly different questions, but I still came out with valor on top, which would have made me a fighter. I stared at the screen a bit and then said, \"screw it, I wanna be a paladin\" and re-did the questions, prioritizing honor. In case you're wondering, this is the one where I lied:Despite the way the game words it, I refuse to see (B) as an \"honorable\" choice. It's more like choosing the lawful evil path.Anyway, I finished up and got a quick recap of the previous game......and found myself in Iolo's hut, with a wounded Shamino. The two characters immediately join the party, so there's no opportunity to talk with them about the next steps. After healing Shamino a bit  with a MANI spell (the game gives you a few starting reagents), I decided to head for the closest town to see what clues I could derive.So far, the gameplay in Ultima V is just fantastic. I haven't played it in more than 15 years, and I had forgotten most of the features that make it so good. To recap some of the ones I've discovered so far:You can interact with the environment in ways unavailable in Ultima IV, or indeed any game that I can think of up to this point. You can look at items (\"thou dost see a hot stove\"), take torches off the wall, search chests and barrels, shove furniture around, toss coins into wells, gaze into crystal balls, drink from fountains, and so on. When you move the character icon over beds and chests, the icon changes to represent the character sitting or lying down. If you step in front of a mirror, you see your reflection in the mirror. I love little touches like these. (I just realized that, for all its realism, Oblivion doesn't have any mirrors.)The party moves a chair in front of the door and sits down to wait patiently.The game has a day/night cycle, not just a moon cycle. At night, the game gets \"dark\" by not showing things beyond a certain radius around the party. NPCs have schedules tied to this cycle, going to bed at night and going to work during the day (or, sometimes, vice versa).There are a lot more equipment items in this game. Ultima IV gave you a single weapon and suit of armor. Here, you've got helmets, gauntlets, boots, and the ability to wield a second (smaller) weapon like a main gauche or a spiked shield (doubles as a weapon and armor) in the off hand.The combat screen is virtually identical to Ultima IV except that instead of attacking in a \"direction,\" you actually target the enemy. You can target on the diagonal (thank god!), and you get more than one attack if you're dual-wielding. You can also identify an \"active player\" in combat, so you can move only one character at a time. Finally, in combat, enemies drop individual treasure rather than one group treasure at the end.The party suffers at the hands of some skeletons.The spell system is a little more complicated. You still mix reagents prior to casting spells (many of the combinations are the same as in Ultima IV), but the spells are arranged in eight \"circles,\" increasing in power, and instead of one spell per letter, each spell is a combination of syllables. I'll cover the magic system in a later posting.What hasn't changed is the best part of the old game: dialogue. The system by which you can talk to NPCs and type in keywords is entirely the same as in Ultima IV, except that I think they say more stuff. Also, HEALTH no longer works as a keyword.Unfortunately, my initial gameplay was a bit inauspicious. I stupidly wandered out of Iolo's place in the middle of the night, found my way to what I assume was Loch Lake, and got blasted by a couple of cannonades from a pirate ship I couldn't even see. Retreating, I ran into a party of eight skeletons, who killed all my characters. At least, however, I find out what happens when you die:Lord British rescues you and returns you to his old throne room in Castle Britannia, with all your hit points intact. I'm not sure if there's any disadvantage other than having to find your way back to where you were when you died.That seems like such a lame way to begin, though, that I'm going to start over with a new character (I hadn't made much progress anyway). From what I've seen so far, this game looks like it's going to be great."}, {"title": "Times of Lore: A Quick Rating", "date": "Saturday, August 13, 2011", "text": "My second, ill-fated quest begins.I mustered all the enthusiasm I could for Times of Lore, but the game finally did me in, after about 12 deaths trying to reach my next objective. This game kicked my ass so badly that in more than four hours of playing, I only have one screenshot to show you.I'm not so stubborn as to keep playing such an unrewarding game just because I don't want it to beat me (although I admit it is a bit galling). Part of the problem, I think, is the controls I'm using. The first question the game asks is \"Do you have a joystick?\" Like Wizard Warz, another difficult-to-maneuver game with a tiny window, this game feels like it simply wasn't meant to be played with a PC keyboard.This is going to shock you, but Andrew Schultz did a walkthrough for this game. It promises some semi-intriguing stuff to come, but to be honest, the walkthrough is a bit more rushed and disorganized than Schultz's normal work. It's also filled with phrases like \"annoying\" and \"patience\" and \"obnoxious,\" which makes me feel better about having bailed on it.I also read Scorpia's review in the January 1989 Computer Gaming World [large PDF]. She confirms that there is no leveling in the game, nor any way to purchase weapons (what is all this gold for?) and no armor at all. Give all this, plus the inventory and combat systems, I've basically wasted all this time playing something that isn't even a CRPG by my definitions. Ultimately, Scorpia liked it better than I did, calling it \"a good introductory computer role-playing game.\"Here's my quick GIMLET: The game world is basic high-fantasy stuff with a quasi-interesting quest setup (3), but character creation is a process of simply choosing one of three classes, and there's no development at all (0). NPC interaction is probably the most interesting part of the game, certainly much more than we get in a typical action CRPG (4). The encounters with various creatures are tedious and unimaginative, although different creatures do attack in different ways (2), and combat (there is no magic) is an ENTER-key-mashing chore (1).You can find a few potions and scrolls--only one of each at a time--and that's the extent of the equipment (1). You do find gold, and food and lodging purchases give the game a basic economy, but not enough to rank it higher than (1). There is a reasonably interesting main quest but no side quests and, I gather from the reviews, no role-playing opportunities (2).Graphics are not torturous, but the sound is (except for the introductory music), the controls simply suck, and (as many of you have pointed out) the game window is too small (2). Finally, the gameplay is theoretically non-linear--you could head out in any direction from the first town--although I think you have to do the quests in a specific order. Ultimately, I just found it too hard, which was partly a function of the keyboard issue (2).Final Score: 18. Almost the exact same score as the aforementioned Wizard Warz, to which this game felt very similar.All right. Time to rouse myself back to Sentinel Worlds. Whether I like that game or not, I think I'll at least be able to get more posting material out of it.[Later edit: if you really want to know more about Times of Lore, reader Dave Eaton has a good review and walkthrough on his site here.]"}, {"title": "Times of Lore: A Chore", "date": "Thursday, August 11, 2011", "text": "I've been seeing this screen a lot.\r\rTimes of Lore's CRPG credentials are a bit questionable. Back when I was playing (or, more accurately, trying to get out of playing) War in Middle Earth, I outlined three core characteristics that a game must have for me to consider it a CRPG.\r\rNon-puzzle-based inventories.  This means that you have to be able to find and carry things that  aren't necessary to solve a puzzle, like swords and potions and such.  Adventure games have inventories, but the items are meant to solve  puzzles, so they don't count.Character leveling and development.  This refers to the accumulation of experience points, the ability to  increase attributes, or other types of character improvement other than better inventories.Combat based at least partly on attribute-derived statistics.  Whether you connect with your opponent, how much damage you do, whether  you avoid your opponent's attack, and how much damage you take should  be based on numbers attached to your attributes, not simply on your  chosen weapon and on how fast you click the mouse.\rThere is no character leveling in Times of Lore, which is one of the things that annoys me most about it. I don't know if there are level-ups that accompany quests later on, but you get no experience rewards for destroying hordes of enemies. Much like Legacy of the Ancients and Questron II, I find myself running past them unless they're literally standing in my way.\r\rCombat is based only on how fast you mash the ENTER key and whether you're facing the right direction when you do. I understand there are weapons improvements later, but those wouldn't be based on attribute-derived statistics. There are no attributes. You don't even get to name your character in this game.\r\rThat leaves inventories, and in this, the game barely sneaks by. As I mentioned in my first posting, you can find two scrolls and two potions that you can use when you need them, but you're limited to one of each. Not quite the robust inventory system you would hope for.\r\rI missed the lake on my original pass, which was south of the road.\r\rThe game isn't completely irredeemable. There are a few decent elements. One is the inability to save anywhere except when you rest in an inn. I realize that to many of you, this isn't a \"good\" point, but I like games that force a certain level of difficulty and that really make you sweat when your hit points start to decrease. Boy, did I sweat today.  Thanks to the map that TheAlmightyGuru linked me to on Tuesday, I was able to find the landmark that I needed to find the orc camp. I made six raids on the orc camp before I successfully obtained the urn containing the Foretelling Stones and lived to tell about it. Three times I died before I reached the urn; two more times, I got it but died before I got back to town. There was a lot of screaming, but screaming isn't necessarily bad--it makes the victory all the more sweet.\r\rThis felt really good for about 10 seconds.\r\rThe other aspect of the game I can tolerate is the NPC dialogue system, which feeds you new keywords with each conversation and then lets you use them in dialogue with others. The only problem is, hardly anyone ever has anything to say. As you'll see if you watch the video below, I got somewhat annoyed with a peasant who knew nothing about anything.\r\rHe's talking about the high king.\r\rReturning to Eralan with the urn, I was rewarded with gold from the robed figure who gave me the quest. So far, I haven't found any place (other than the inn) to spend the 371 gold pieces I've amassed, but I hope that changes soon. My benefactor has directed me to the regent's palace for the next quest.\r\r\rUnfortunately, six essays before victory means that I wasn't able to amass enough material for much of a posting. I did make a video of about 4 minutes of gameplay.\r\r\r\rYou see me head out of the inn, leave town, and accost a serf on the road. I get annoyed fairly quickly with his insistence that he doesn't \"know anything useful,\" with unfortunate consequences. Moving on, I accidentally kill another peasant after accidentally mistaking him for an orc. I spend a lot of time navigating a forest maze before finally reaching the goblin camp at 03:30. After a bit of combat, I accidentally waste a scroll and then die.\r\rYou can see in the video how difficult it is to maneuver in the game. You can't move diagonally, and there's a brief pause when you change directions, meaning that you can't move very fluidly. Monsters are a bit more agile and it makes it hard to line yourself up on their vector. Most of the time I throw my dagger, I miss.\r\rThe game is serving its purpose in providing something uncomplicated I can play while on the road. I'll stick with it until I feel I can devote enough time to getting back into Sentinel Worlds."}, {"title": "Written Fantasy and the Malazan Book of the Fallen", "date": "Wednesday, August 10, 2011", "text": "I often can't identify which characters from inside a book are on the front cover, but this is clearly Anomander Rake with Dragnipur.I've said here several times that I don't like Lord of the Rings. Nonetheless, I can appreciate it. To me, Rings is like Wizardry for many modern CRPG gamers: they salute it for its contributions to the oeuvre, but they don't find it particularly enjoyable. In my case, I just think Tolkien was a lousy writer. He created evocative worlds and languages, but he needed someone like Brandon Sanderson to punch up the copy.In discussions of the \"best\" or \"greatest\" fantasy novels of all time, I think we have to exclude writers like Tolkien. He's the source, after all--the ur-writer who established the archetypes, who outlined the tropes. Almost all modern fantasy--novels, games, and films--owe Tolkien some debt. So let's take him off the table. After him, a variety of authors developed the genre, and I think in recent years, we've seen fantasy writing reach a certain peak.I want to make a case for the Malazan Book of the Fallen series as the greatest fantasy series of all time.In yesterday's posting, I made a sly allusion to the series, which Kyle Haight noted that he caught. His comment set me thinking about how I don't write much about fantasy series, even though I consume them in the thousands of pages. I don't know if I'm a naturally voracious reader, but my work/travel schedule, which involves at least two flights a week, has left me with a bonanza of time for reading. This has even affected my CRPG playing, a bit: whereas I would often spend evenings in hotel rooms playing games, nowadays I'm equally as likely to take my Kindle down to the hotel bar and cover a hundred or so pages until the sheer number of gimlets renders further reading impossible.It turns out that such is the best method of reading the Malazan Book of the Fallen. This is not a series that rewards time off. There are too many characters to keep track of, too many plot threads being woven at the same time, that to take a break for a few weeks is to essentially shut the door on the series. This series was meant to be read all at once, without stopping. My Amazon account says that I bought Gardens of the Moon on June 17, and I'm currently on Reaper's Gale (Book 7). (It is my second reading for the first eight books.) I expect to finish Book 10 right about the time I earn Delta Diamond Medallion level status in September. It's going to be a banner month.I will be the first to admit that the Malazan series is a difficult series. Sometimes I wonder how I had the patience to get into it. Gardens of the Moon drops you into a complex world with no explanation whatsoever about what's happening, what the history is, what the politics are, who the competing factions are, and so forth (and you frankly don't get a handle on these things until about Book 3). Primed by Tokien (elves vs. orcs), Jordan (Aes Sedai vs. the Dark One), Goodkind (Richard Cypher vs. Darken Rahl, then later vs...I don't know...some kind of emperor...honestly, did anyone read the series that far?) and so on, you immediately start casting about for the \"good guys\" and the \"bad guys\" and you find no clear delineation. The titular Malazans don't come off as very \"good,\" although there are some noble characters among them. You figure an ominously-named character called \"Shadowthrone\" and the god of assassins, \"Cotillion,\" must be (or \"must needs be,\" as Erikson would say) \"bad,\" but within a couple of books, you develop the distinct impression that these two characters might, in fact, be conspiring to save the world from destruction. Or trying to destroy it themselves. There's no way to know.The books allude to a history that is ancient--ancient cities, enemies, allies, rights, and wrongs. Some of the characters have lived for 300,000+ years, and yet none of them have any idea what the $&#* is going on. It's just like real life, really. You get the impression that Erikson and Esslemont (his co-creator who has written several of his own books in the world) didn't so much create the world as discover it. Both of them are archeologists by trade, and in the novels, you can see an archaeologist's attention to detail in the uncovering of ancient civilizations. Their words are like the brushes that they use to carefully separate bones from dust. But as in archaeology, you can rarely be certain about anything. You get tantalizing hints but have to conjecture the rest. I've read some of these books three times, and I'm still not certain what the relationship is between Dissembelackis, the Hounds of Darkness, the Hounds of Shadow, and the Deragoth. I'm frankly not even sure Erikson does.On the surface, there's no reason why I shouldn't hate this. Why would anyone want to read 5,000 pages about the Seven Cities subcontinent and still be confused about the different tribes and what happened to the First Empire? And yet it's intoxicating, the idea that no one--not the characters, not even the authors--has all the answers. It frees you to watch the scenery go by in a blur, if you so choose, and focus on the characters. And the characters are what make the series.Like real people, they can be grand and noble in some circumstances, and murderous and vile in others. You find yourself rooting for a character like Karsa Orlong and his concern for justice, conveniently forgetting that in his first 50 pages he engaged in a series of senseless rapes and massacres. Kalam Mekhar is a popular character despite the fact that he directly contributed to the tragedy in the second book known as the Chain of Dogs. Why do we just forgive him for this? Two of the most amusing figures are, ultimately, an egomaniac and a near-omnipotent god who nonetheless seems to ignore the suffering around him. But how we delight in their banter! Is the Empress a wicked usurper or a besieged ruler doing her best to save the many at the expense of the few? Or something in between? The books give us every possible answer.George R. R. Martin has been praised for this: characters that seem like antagonists become sympathetic once you get a couple of chapters from their points of view. In The Game of Thrones, Jaime Lannister tries to murder a child who spots him in the midst of a longstanding affair with his married sister, and yet two books later he comes off as a bit of a hero. It's the same here, but tenfold. High King Kallor murders one of the most beloved characters in the series, and a few books later, you're practically crying tears of sympathy for him. I even suspect that the Crippled God--the ostensible antagonist in the entire series--is going to turn out to be a pitiable, decent soul by the end of the last book (please, for K'rul's sake, no spoilers!).Many of the characters are what Erikson calls \"ascendants.\" Those that have worshipers are gods. There are multiple paths to ascendancy, but none of them in any particularly consistent way (there are no \"rules\" that hold through the entire series; every one has multiple corollaries and exceptions). You get the feeling that a host of them are ascendants without even realizing it.  Their approaches to conflict are so varied and unique that you quiver with anticipation when two of them are about to meet. My \"wish list\" of such convergences is a mile long, and I suppose it's folly to expect that they'll ever all happen. But please, please, Steve, put Karsa and Kruppe in the same room before the end. (To me, Kruppe is the most memorable character of any book ever written.) You could sustain an entire novel just describing a lunch at which Iskaral Pust, Tehol, Bugg, Kellanved, Tavore, and Corabb were all in attendance.The morality of the series is also fascinating. Within the first book, you have the annihilation of an entire army only a few chapters from a character worrying about the moral implications of adultery. In Deadhouse Gates, the author graphically describes the rapes and slaughter of thousands of innocent civilians and then somehow brings you to tears over the sacrifice of a horse. But in this, again, the books mirror real life. We grieve deeply the people we know and pause only a moment to consider the deaths of thousands in far-off places. In neither in or out of the books is this hypocrisy; it is enough--it must be enough--to occupy ourselves with those inside our circles of concern and influence.Hood's breath, am I going on. And I haven't even talked about the races. Let's just say that, again, the books mirror real life. There aren't many \"racial traits.\" I haven't ever finished The Lord of the Rings, but my guess is that you never find a fat elf, a good orc, or a temperate dwarf. It is the tradition of fantasy authors--and not to mention CRPG designers--to assign absolute traits (including alignments) to their races. Not Erikson. Humans, Jaghut, T'lan Imass, Tiste Edur...these ultimately just boil down to convenient ways to describe how someone looks. T'lan Imass are supposed to be singularly driven and clan-oriented, but these are traits more honored in the breach than in the observance. The series delights in introducing stereotypes and turning them on their heads. We have immortal races who exhibit shocking short-sightedness, and mortals who have planned and plotted in such detail that in ten books, we cannot see the full scope of their machinations.Most important, since we're with this author for more than a million words, is the language. Erikson is, above everything else, a good writer. This is probably why I stuck with Gardens of the Moon long enough to recognize the fundamental greatness of the series. I have read many fantasy authors that I thought were \"good\" writers--Sanderson, Martin, Hobb, even Jordan despite his frequent repetition of idiotic phrases--but Erikson is the only fantasy writer that I have felt was \"great,\" in a truly Dickensian way. He has that rare art of knowing when to describe fully, and when to describe in sketches. Witness:The Tarancede tower rose from the south side of Trate's harbour. Hewn from raw basalt it was devoid of elegance or beauty, reaching like a gnarled arm seven stories from an artificial island of jagged rocks. Waves hammered it from all sides, flinging spume into the air. There were no windows, no doors, yet a series of glossy obsidian plates ringed the uppermost level, each one as tall as a man and almost as wide.--Midnight Tides, Chapter 6When sober, the sergeant noticed things, in a proper a diligent manner suited to a city guard. And while she was not consistently drunk, cold sobriety was an invitation to hysteria, so Hellian endeavored to proceed steadily on the wobbly rope of not-quite-drunk. Accordingly, she had not known of the odd ship now moored in the Free Docks, that had arrived before sunrise, its pennons indicating that it had come from Malaz Island.--The Bonehunters, PrologueThis kind of prose comes along and swats braid-tugging, crossing-arms-under-breasts, wheels of time turning with ages coming and passing, leaving memories that become legend completely off the competition board. And yet Malazan has sold maybe 400,000 copies and Wheel of Time us up to something like 47 million. Wheel of Time also has an extensive online wiki, while Malazan, which frankly really needs it, has only a couple of half-assed attempts.It all comes back to the complexity of the series, which brings me back to my original point about needing to read it all at once. You simply don't pick up the details if you take breaks. Let me cover one example. In Deadhouse Gates (Book 2), some characters accidentally get pulled into a warren (sort-of like an alternate dimension that serves as a source of magic), where they find a ship called the Silanda. It is crewed by a group of headless, ensorcelled Tiste Andii (a dark-skinned race), and the visitors discover that the captain and his officers, a group of grey-skinned Tiste Edur--have been slaughtered. What happened to them? Even as several of the characters take over the vessel and bring it back to the real world, we never find out.Fast forward to House of Chains (Book 4), where in a prologue set earlier than Book 2, we see the barbarian Karsa Orlong accidentally find himself in the same warren. He comes across the Edur-crewed ship and kills the crew, then just as swiftly departs, leaving it to be discovered by the Malazans in Deadhouse Gates. Aha!, we say. So he's the one who chopped up that ship! But who are the Tiste Edur in the first place? Well, we don't find that out until Midnight Tides (Book 5), but even then, we only discover their backstory. Not until The Bonehunters (Book 6) does it become clear why they were in the warren to begin with, and if you're paying close attention, you have a moment--a real end-of-The Sixth Sense kind of moment--when you realize exactly who the captain was, what he was doing there, and what his fateful chance encounter with Karsa actually meant for another character and, consequently, the overall direction of the series. There's no way you're going to keep all of this straight if you take a nice leisurely break between books.Have you all really gotten this far? Well, I'm sorry; I have no connection between this entry and CRPGs, except to say that I would love to play a CRPG set in the Malazan world--or even one set in a world of this kind of complexity. Only The Elder Scrolls really comes close. I'm writing this longhand on a plane after my Kindle ran out of juice in the middle of Book 7. More on Times of Lore tomorrow.But before I close, let me take a moment for my readers who have read the Malazan series. There is a moment in Book 3 that I find simply haunting, and I want you to recall it to see if you agree. Books 2 and 3 are both set contemporaneously to each other, on separate continents, and both describe armies engaged in essentially hopeless wars. Each makes staggering sacrifices, and in the end, one is victorious (though sort of a Pyrrhic victory) and the other is not.Book 2 (Deadhouse Gates) is simply brutal. Erikson's writing ensures that we reach the end as exhausted as the characters, and some things happen that are jaw-dropping in their cruelty, both to the characters and to the readers who have followed them this far. We close the book and pick up Book 3 (Memories of Ice). And while some awful things happen in this book, they don't seem as fundamentally unfair as what happened in Book 2. The epilogue even seems reasonably happy. And then we get this. I'm not going to set it up because I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't read it. You have to remember who these people are, where they are, and how they got there.\"Sure,\" Spindle snapped, \"A story to break our hearts all over again! What's the value in that?\"A rough, broken voice replied, \"There is value.\"Everyone fell silent, and turned to Duiker.The Imperial Historian had looked up, was studying them with dark eyes. \"Value. Yes. I think, much value. But not yours, soldiers. Not yet. Too soon for you. Too soon.\"\"Perhaps,\" Baruk mummured, \"Perhaps you are right in that. We ask too much--\"\"Of them. Yes.\" The old man looked down once more at the cloth in his hands.The silence stretched.Duiker made no move.Picker began to turn back to her companions--when the man began speaking. \"Very well, permit me, if you will, on this night. To break your hearts once more. This is the story of the Chain of Dogs. Of Coltaine of the Crow Clan, newly come Fist to the 7th Army...\"Those last words have power I've never experienced in another book about fantasy creatures with pointed ears and tusked faces. Tolkien never had this kind of power. Duiker is about to tell them the story of Book 2. And we know what this will do to them. It's truly going to break their hearts--so much that we don't see them again for five books. And at the same time, having read the story of the Chain of Dogs, it breaks ours once more--the last paragraph is both Duiker speaking to the patrons of K'rul's Bar and Erikson speaking to us. This is the greatest fantasy series of all time."}, {"title": "Game 62: Times of Lore (1988)", "date": "Tuesday, August 9, 2011", "text": "Times of LoreUnited StatesORIGIN Systems (developer and publisher)Released 1988 for Apple II Commodore 64; 1989 for Amiga, DOS, and ZX Spectrum; 1990 for Amstrad CPC and NESDate Started: 9 August 2011 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, I know. Don't start, all right? I don't like having three active games on the board any more than you do. But you wanted me to start posting again, right? I've hit a bit of a wall with both Sentinel Worlds and Star Command. They're too similar, for one thing. It was a huge mistake trying to play them both at the same time, because I forget which gameplay elements belong to which game. Anyway, I made attempts to re-start both of them several times over the last two days and found myself watching re-runs of Scrubs instead. My triumphant return was ruined.Times of Lore is a relatively generic high-fantasy game with an uncomplicated quest and interface. It's just the sort of thing I need to get the pump primed again. Let me get back in the habit of blogging, and then I'll go back to the two sci-fi CRPGs. Fair enough?The back story is told in a series of well-illustrated screens at the beginning of the game, accompanied by a quantum leap (at least for DOS) in game music (it's too bad I don't much care about music). The story is set in the kingdom of Albareth, whose king and high mage have mysteriously vanished shortly after winning a ten-year war against a barbarian horde (one suspects they have ascended to rule the House of Shadows). The king's ineffectual steward, Dariel, hasn't been managing things so well. The barbarians are threatening the kingdom again, the lords are squabbling amongst themselves, the wizards have gone into hiding, and a new evil cult is rising.Despite the growing danger in the countryside, my father, a woodsman, has refused to leave his home, and has instead sent me to stay with my wealthy uncle in Eralan, Albareth's capital city. At the same time, the steward has summoned a council of lords, demanding that they bring various magical artifacts with them, hoping to summon back the king and his Medallion of Power. When my uncle suddenly dies, leaving me his gold, I am left to make my way as an adventurer, running missions for the steward and the lords.Basically, I can be a fighter, a fighter, or a fighter.Character creation is a quick process of choosing a knight, a valkyrie, or a barbarian (someone's been playing Gauntlet). I went with a valkyrie because, what the heck, I never play a female PC, and I immediately found myself in a tavern.The game hand-waves how the daughter of a woodcutter ends up a valkyrie.The game's Origin origins show in the graphics but not in the gameplay--it almost immediately revealed itself as an action CRPG, and not a particularly good one. Commands are limited to talk, examine, inventory, pick up, drop, give, and use. There is no diagonal movement. The game supports mouse control, but I found it so wonky that I disabled it and went to keyboard-only. The in-game sound is not up to the quality of the pre-game music.This being an Origin game, though, we have to have some NPC dialogue, and it's fairly extensive for an action RPG. You begin by selecting the \"talk\" icon on the far left (although it looks more like you're about to bite the NPC) and from there have a selection of options. If you don't want to be rude, you begin with \"start chitchat\" and then you can ask for rumors or whatever the other topics of the day are. Speaking to the innkeeper, I got a hint about a sorcerous tower to the north of the city. The game buzzes at you every time an NPC says something that opens up a new dialogue topic.In another room of the inn, I immediately got a quest from a cloaked figure to retrieve the Foretelling Stones--one of the magical artifacts summoned by the steward--which had been stolen by orcs in a caravan raid.I tried exploring the town and immediately found myself out of the town, heading through the wilderness. The game doesn't seem to have any transition between areas. I was immediately assailed by a large number of orcs and other enemies, who I dispatched by facing them and repeatedly hitting the ENTER key.Trying to talk to someone attempting to kill me was a mistake.Enemies drop gold, scrolls, food, and potions. The scrolls and potions have different colors, and it didn't take me long to figure out what they do: blue scrolls freeze enemies, red scrolls kill all visible enemies, blue potions heal a little, green potions heal a lot. I'm not sure, but it might be that you can only have one of each item. I've never held more than one, and I've noticed that if I use one, an enemy tends to drop the same item fairly soon afterwards.I wandered north for what seemed like an eon before I finally succumbed to the wounds inflicted by repeat combat. Hit points are represented by a candle on the right side of the screen. The game announces death by placing a tombstone at the very spot where the enemy slew me--it was nice of the townsfolk to bury my body where it lay and erect a memorial.I set out again and was  a little more careful. At length, I came to a house of a woodsman (not my father, I gather), who was upset about the proliferation of orcs in the area. He told me that to find their camp, I needed to continue on the forest road to a pool, then head north along a winding trail.From the woodsman, I also got a dagger, which automatically throws if I hit ENTER while not right next to an enemy. I have to keep remembering to pick it up after each combat.At this point, here's what I don't know about Times of Lore: whether you gain experience or levels for killing monsters ('cause otherwise, it seems easy enough just to run by them), what happens if I attack townsfolk, whether there's anything to buy with the gold besides food and a night's sleep at the inn, and how, exactly, I save the game (resting in the inn seems to save it, but I don't know if there's any other way).With the basic combat, the large game world, and the various potions and scrolls, I am reminded--unfavorably--of Faery Tale Adventure. As I've said before, action CRPGs don't tend to age very well. Games with interesting tactics (Wizardry), compelling plots (Ultima IV), broad worlds to explore (Starflight), or all three (Pool of Radiance, Might & Magic) never grow old, but games that blow their wad on graphics, sound, and action last only as long as the next better game that comes along.I wanted to at least complete the first quest before I finished posting for the night, but I wandered along that damned forest path for an hour and never found a pool of water. The game world seems quite large and mostly devoid of anything interesting. But it's uncomplicated--thank Lord British for that."}, {"title": "A CRPG Wish List", "date": "Saturday, August 6, 2011", "text": "[Note: All images were removed from this entry five days after the initial posting because something was hosing the RSS feeds. Sorry about the all-text format.]\r\rOne of these days, I'm going to sit down and conceptualize my idea of the perfect CRPG.  Until then, here's a list of things that I rarely or never see in CRPGs (keeping in mind that I haven't played them all; feel free to comment on games I've overlooked) that I would love to see developers include in the future.\r\r1. Adaptive end games based on how long the player takes. In Baldur's Gate II, you end one chapter emerging from the Underdark, hot on the trail of Irenicus. After resting up, you head immediately to Suldanessellar to save it from the mad elf's rampages. Or not. Instead, you can head back to Athkatla and do some more quests. Or just wander around. Or explore Watcher's Keep. You can let literally years of game time pass before going to Suldanessellar. And when you get there, Irenicus and his minions are always in the same exact stage of their invasion.\r\rHow much cooler would it be if every day that passed, you had to face more enemies, and more powerful enemies, when you finally deigned to visit the elf city? What if, enough time having passed, monstrosities started making their way out of Irenicus's now-conquered city and into the surrounding countryside? Yes, it would require more programming, and some modifications of the quests in Suldanessellar, but not as much as you might think. You just have to move your encounters with key characters from houses and outdoor areas to dungeons and modify a little dialogue.\r\rEssentially, I want games to punish me for dithering.\r\rOblivion almost gets there with this, by having Oblivion gates open up around the countryside, but their appearance is based on quest stages and not on the overall passage of time (this strikes me as something that someone ought to be able to mod). Also, Mehrunes Dagon doesn't realize it, but he has the laziest minions in the history of the pantheon. He sends them through the Oblivion gates, and having reached fresh air and grass, they promptly...well, hang around the gate until some adventurer shows up and kills them. If the creators really wanted to ramp up the sense of urgency and danger, they'd have these hellspawn wander into nearby towns and start killing guards.\r\r2. Integrated use of character names. Honestly, why have me go through all the trouble of naming a character if everyone in the game is just going to call me \"The Warden\" the entire time? The ham-handed ways that games find to ignore your chosen name border on laughable. In Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, it turns out that whatever name you use, you're actually an amnesiac ex-Jedi with a curiously androgynous name, which everyone uses after it's revealed. In Jade Empire and Oblivion, the arena masters insist that your real name isn't memorable and have you pick something like \"Flaming Dragon\" that, coincidentally, they have sound files of the announcers using. In Fable, you buy a title like \"Pie Master\" or \"Chicken Chaser.\" There are times in Baldur's Gate in which NPCs use the third person plural pronoun to refer to you (\"Don't annoy the child of Bhaal! They are our only hope!\") because the creators were too lazy to vary the text based on sex.\r\rYes, I know that the main issue here is spoken dialogue. No one wants to play a game in which cinematic-quality voice acting is interrupted by something that sounds like a drunk Stephen Hawking trying to speech-recognize whatever weird combination of vowels and consonants you've given yourself. But here's a secret I don't think most modern game developers realize: Not every bit of dialogue needs to be spoken! Though I picked on them above, the Baldur's Gate games actually strike a good balance. People refer to you by name in the text dialogue, and when the spoken dialogue reaches that point, it just throws in a substitute or stops entirely. I can live with that.\r\r3. Tactical use of the environment. I want to be able to block entryways with bodies, toss rocks and chairs at enemies, shove foes down flights of stairs and over balcony railings, splinter doors with an axe, and pin enemies to the wall with the well-placed shove of a table.\r\rAgain, Oblivion almost gets there. The developers spent a lot of time on realistic game physics--you can even move individual limbs of dead foes--to almost no purpose. Although you can pick up and throw things, there isn't a single place in the game where it's important to do so. And bigger objects, you can't move at all.\r\rThere are non-CRPGs that handle this well. Half-Life 2 comes to mind. It's been a while since I played, but I remember the delight of using the gravity gun to embed paint cans in the skulls of enemy soldiers, or blocking a stairway with a bed while I tossed grenades into the room below.\r\r4. Crippling, disabling, and amputating in 3D CRPGs. I include the last bit because these types of injuries have been possible in some isometric CRPGs going back to Wizard's Crown. But they'd be so much more satisfying in modern 3-D games with better graphics. Why does a sword slash always lead to a little blood loss but never a severed arm or leg? Mind you, I'm not keen on these things happening to me, but the thought of slicing wings off cliff racers excites me in ways I don't fully understand.\r\r5. Temptation to evil. A lot of games let you be evil, some even providing alternate main quests and endings for this choice. But not enough games truly tempt you to evil. You generally end up with the same advantages and disadvantages, the same power and level, no matter which path you choose. In Neverwinter Nights, you can bully people into giving you more money for quests, for instance, but money loses most of its value about 1/4 of the way through the game. Being a thief in Morrowind grants you virtually no advantage since so much stuff is lying around anyway (and there's no karma meter, so evil choices have no real effect). For God's sake, you can spend the entire game of Oblivion as a vampire, and never kill anyone! In a good CRPG, being evil wouldn't be a \"choice\" you make to vary the gameplay, but rather just as it is in real life: a temptation to measurably greater wealth and power.\r\r6. Fire. This is partly related to #3, but I would really like--and please don't infer anything about my psychology based on this--to be able to set things on fire. Like, permanently. I want to hurl one of my torches into a pile of straw and watch the whole barn go up in flames. After all, the Daedra destroyed Kvatch--why can't I do the same to some annoying farmhouse?\r\r7. Graffiti. Swords of Glass remains the only game I know where you can make permanent marks on dungeon walls, and even there you only get an \"X.\" The ability to tag doorways and dungeon walls would help immeasurably with mapping, or even just determining what dungeons you've already explored. I shouldn't have to drop arrows to mark paths already taken.\r\r8. A true split party. I think the first game I played that allowed me to send party members in different directions was Ultima VI. I still remember how awesome it seemed at the time. The Infinity engine games were famous for this, and I used to role-play it a bit, pretending my ranger PC just needed to get away by himself for a while. I'd see how much of a map I could clear before having to call my other party members for aid. In one memorable bit in Icewind Dale II, you can have a thief plundering items from a house while your paladin simultaneously apologizes to the owner.\r\rBut why can't I split my party across multiple maps? Why can't I send Jaheira and her annoying husband to return the cloak to some guy in the Friendly Arm Inn while the rest of the party continues through Cloakwoood? I know the answer, of course: programming limitations. But those should be a thing of the past in 2012. If I have five active quests, I want to be able to send five different PCs off to accomplish them.\r\r9. A modern setting. Look, I like high fantasy and sci-fi as much as anyone, but are there any good, honest-to-god CRPGs set in the real world? I  don't want to play a dental hygienist, of course, but why can't you CRPG a police officer? Or a Navy SEAL? A spy? I'm sure you'll all tell me about games in which you can do this, but you have to admit: they're few and far between.\r\r10. Weapon familiarity bonuses. You begin the CRPG with a sword--a treasured family heirloom passed down through the generations and given to you, in a tearful episode, by your dying father. What do you do with it? Slay a few rats and then sell it as soon as you find a long sword +1. Honestly, CRPG characters have no sentimentality. They're happy to discard any weapon or bit of armor as soon as something better comes along.\r\rI finished playing Dragon Age: Origins a few weeks ago, and I loved how you got bonuses for wearing different pieces of armor of the same style. It makes sense if solely from a fashion standpoint: my Morrowind character looks pretty silly with a leather cuirass, ebony boots, chain greaves, a glass pauldron on one shoulder, and a steel pauldron on the other. Now it's time for weapon familiarity bonuses: the longer you wield a particular weapon, the greater its power. Your original bronze short sword might be a short sword +9 of dragon slaying by the end of the game. This would make you think carefully before discarding one weapon in favor of the latest and greatest.\r\rWhat other desirable features do you almost never see in CRPGs? Discuss while I ease myself back in to active playing.\r\rP.S.: Just got that in under the wire, didn't I?"}, {"title": "The CRPG Addict Will Return...", "date": "Sunday, July 31, 2011", "text": "...on or about Saturday, August 6. I appreciate your patience during what has been an extremely difficult past month."}, {"title": "Star Command: Making the Galaxy Safe for Democracy", "date": "Monday, July 11, 2011", "text": "And I will not be burning it for fuel.Star Command is a fun, fast-paced, uncomplicated, and delightful little game that came along just when I needed it. I'm spending the week in one of my least favorite cities--let's just say it's in the southeastern U.S. to avoid upsetting any of my readers--where it's 100+ every day this week. I've been returning to my hotel room at night after hours of teaching, exhausted, with less than an hour to devote to fun things, and if I had to face Sentinel Worlds during that hour...well, I wouldn't. I'd just watch TV, and you'd all be waiting until next week for the next posting.Star Command is apparently not big on \"due process.\"After my triumph in my first mission yesterday, I immediately headed to headquarters and got another one, to defeat five transports of criminals circling a planet within the Triangle. I decided to postpone this and just explore a little of the galaxy outside the Triangle first. So after upgrading some of my ship's weapons and buying more armor, I headed out. This turned out to be a mistake. First of all, fuel decreases fast as you explore the galaxy, and until I get a bigger ship, I can't go very far from a starport. Second, there's some mean, mean stuff in the area outside the Triangle.The pre-combat screen tells you a little about the terrain you're fighting on and what you're facing.I had some luck exploring planets and retrieving artifacts and biospecimens for later sale (although it turns out you don't really get much money for either). But in the midst of my explorations, I was attacked on a planet by hordes of \"insect hatchlings.\" This was my first experience in squad-based combat (as opposed to space combat), and it was fairly interesting. You begin each combat with a \"communications phase\" in which your codebreaker or psychic tries to speak to the enemy. If this fails, you go  into a tactical combat screen. The game tells you what squares represent good offensive positions, which ones represent good defensive positions, and how many squads of enemies you face. You maneuver around this combat screen, engaging with heavy or light weapons (some neat animation associated with this), until one of you is dead.This is the best depiction of a flamethrower yet seen in a CRPG.Unfortunately, it was me. I faced far too many enemies to even hope to win, even though I enjoyed watching my characters mow them down with flamethrowers. Lesson learned: stay in the Triangle until I'm stronger. There are other combat variables associated with gravity and atmosphere that I still have to learn.So far, lots of armor has saved my ship from serious damage in combat.Reloading, I went out to perform the mission. I found the group of five transports after exploring several planets in the system, and I defeated them all in a very satisfying round of space combat. I had trained a couple of my characters in astro-gunnery, and I had spent money outfitting every angle of my ship with one weapon or another. This allowed me to shoot at enemies no matter what direction they came at me from.And when you defeat ships, they don't disappear, but rather disperse into chunks.After my victory, I returned to the starport for more rewards, promotions, and training. Training and leveling are quite satisfying in the game. You gain one training session for every mission that you complete, and you can purchase additional sessions for 200,000 gold, meaning--and this is a big thing for me--you  never run out of reasons to make money. Each training session raises one chosen statistic by 1-10 points, and it also raises a skill by a half or whole point. There seems to be some randomness associated with this, but it's partly based on the character's intelligence score. I don't know if this is a good strategy or not, but I've decided to have each character specialize in one or two skills instead of trying to create \"well-rounded\" characters that have lots of skills.I've been saving my money for a new ship, so I didn't buy much in the way of upgrades. My third mission asked me to visit a planet just outside the Triangle where some miners were being hassled by pirates. When I encountered the pirates, they were in just one ship, so I took the opportunity to close with it and board:The shipboard combat screen was just like the planet-based squad combat, only with tables and chairs instead of rocks and trees. This time, I won handily and towed the defeated ship back to base for some nice salvage.There are three things that I really like about this game so far:1. \"The Triangle\" helps define a fairly small section of the galaxy, from which you can explore in relative safety. This makes it easy to ease in to the game. Contrast with Sentinel Worlds, where you start in the middle of combat.2. There seems to be a lot of freedom of movement. You can take missions or just start exploring. If you do go exploring, there are lots of things to do, from fighting pirates and aliens to exploring planets. The exploration isn't as detailed or nuanced as Sentinel Worlds (or even Starflight), but it's still fun.To the hypotenuse...and beyond!3. The missions are really well-constructed to introduce you each gameplay element in turn. I know there's a lot more to come because I can buy espionage equipment and environmental suits and such. I haven't even experimented with chemical weapons or explosives or my \"Esper\" abilities. But the game eases you into its complexities instead of throwing them all at you at once.4. Completing missions (at least so far) is fairly fast-paced and immediately rewarding with money (I keep writing \"gold\" and having to delete it) and training.Again, a perfect game to play for short bursts of time. To the extent that I post any more this week, it'll probably be about Star Command exclusively."}, {"title": "Game 61: Star Command (1988)", "date": "Sunday, July 10, 2011", "text": "Star CommandUnited StatesIndependently developed; published by Strategic Simulations, Inc.Released 1988 for DOS, 1989 for Atari ST, Amiga, and PC-98Date Started: 10 July 2011\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I haven't given up on Sentinel Worlds,  but my work has become so busy this summer that I can only play games  in windows of 10-30 minutes at a time. That's no way to play Sentinel Worlds,  whose learning curve--even with all the help you offered in the  comments--is steep enough to require a dedicated day just to get into  it.I itched to jump to Ultima V since I thought I could leap right into it without having to learn the interface, but I figured I'd give Star Command a shot, especially since some anonymous commenter showed up yesterday  to start me off with some hints. I'm pleased to say that it's a much  more accessible game, and I think I can crank out a series of postings  on it while I wait for life to return to normal.Star Command is another SSI offering, developed by the same team that gave us Phantasie I-III, all competent games. Wikipedia says that it was based on a board game. The  game takes place at an unidentified point in the \"far future,\" long after Earth has been destroyed by some \"hostile aliens.\" Humans live in a  region of space known as \"The Triangle,\" so named because it is the shape formed by the three ports of \"Star  Command,\" the military forces of humanity who are fighting losing wars  on two frontiers: the Alpha Frontier, infested with organized pirates;  the Beta Frontier, ruled by hostile insect aliens bent on the  destruction of humanity. There are also rumors of other races and a  civilization of robots.The player controls eight characters who engage in missions for Star Command, \"from  your first anti-piracy patrol all the way through the climactic final  mission to save mankind.\" There is apparently some randomization to the  assignment of missions, which the game touts as allowing extensive  replays.The interesting character creation process hearkens to Space,  one of the earliest CRPGs, which I once played (briefly) on an Apple II  emulator site. Each character has seven attributes--strength, speed,  accuracy, courage, willpower, Esper (psychic skill, basically), and  intelligence--and is assigned to one of four classes: pilot, marine,  soldier, and Esper (of which you can only have one). Each character also  has a rank, from private to grand admiral, each of which receives a  different monthly salary.Private Nesmith's character sheet.After creating the characters, you send  them to basic training for eight years, where they can achieve levels  in any of 12 basic skills, depending on their class. Sometimes they fail  their classes and you lose the year. Other times, they succeed and gain  a level or increased attributes. When they finish training, at the age  of 28, they are ready to embark on missions.A character wastes a year.I had initially rolled what I thought was a really good party, but when I went to save the game, it asked me some copy protection questions and told me I was \"WRONG!\" even when I was sure I was right. It locked up after two failures, and I had to restart and recreate my characters. The second party didn't turn out quite as good as the first. I later discovered a work-around to the copy protection on a message board.Called a \"hornet,\" but looks kind of like a skeleton of a fat guy.After party creation, the first step is to purchase a ship. Ships come  in four varieties: scout ships, escorts, corvettes (I thought corvettes  were Chevrolet models, but Wikipedia tells me that they're lightly armed warships; add another one to the list),  and frigates. Each model has multiple classes. The only ones I could  afford at the beginning were hornet- and wasp-class scout ships. The  game manual indicated that they had the same stats but that the  hornet-class ship cost a lot less, so I bought that one. I christened it the ISS \"Protector.\"After making the entire character- and ship-creation process a Galaxy Quest homage, I realized I was thinking of the wrong Tim Allen movie.After the ship, I purchased  a bewildering array of weapons, armor, and other equipment, both for the ship and for each crewmember. The manual had a table with the relative damage done by all the weapons--which come in multiple varieties--but I got sick of consulting it constantly and ended up buying largely random stuff.I have no idea what the differences between all these things are.When I was ready, I visited headquarter for my first mission, which turned out to be making a scientific survey of all the planets at a certain pair of coordinates and bringing back anything I found. I headed out of spaceport.Sounds like the stuff legends are made of.Exploration of the galaxy is through a tactical space map, not so far removed from either Sentinel Worlds or Starflight. There are different map levels, from entire-galaxy to individual-planet, and you move your ship throughout the region, keeping a careful eye on fuel (apparently, running out of fuel really, really sucks). You have a landing craft for descending on planets for espionage missions, scientific missions, or simple exploration.The crew of the ISS Protector opens a pawn shop.Shortly after arriving in the exploration area, I encountered a trio of spacecraft and hailed them. Star Command doesn't give you the dialogue options of Sentinel Worlds but is closer to the \"postures\" that you can adopt in Pool of Radiance. You can bribe or beg your way out of a fight, ask the other ships for favors, try to intimidate them into giving you things, or \"impersonate a diety\" [sic]. I asked for a truce, but the other ships laughed at me and we entered combat.\"Aliens! I am Richard Simmons! Bow before me!\"Combat is blessedly turn-based rather than real-time (as in Sentinel Worlds) and it involves several movement phases followed by a fighting phase. It isn't terribly hard; you try to take on the ships one-by-one and maneuver in such a way that your weapons outgun theirs and your armor outlasts theirs. I'll post a video when I get more experienced at it. Apparently, you can also attempt to board the ships, defeat the occupants in hand-to-hand combat, and tow the ship to spaceport as salvage, but I haven't tried that yet.Enemy counters with Ritalin missile.Later, when I returned to a Star Command station, I was told that the ships I had defeated were civilian ships and that I would be getting no credit for that. I don't know why they attacked me in the first place, then. The manual seems to suggest that once you encounter an enemy ship, there's essentially no way to avoid combat, although I guess you could just fly away without fighting after combat begins.I was rewarded for completing the mission--rewards are based on rank--and given some extra credits. I'll see about buying some new stuff and heading out on the next mission!Before I go, though, it's worth pausing to note the difficulty that both sci-fi games and sci-fi films have with three-dimensional space. This is the third space-oriented CRPG I've played in which navigation takes place on a two-dimensional map with two-dimensional coordinate systems. I realize the technological limitations of the era, but Star Command compounds the era with the designation of the \"triangle\" and its mention of linear \"frontiers.\"What's even more surprising is that sci-fi films and TV shows suffer the same two-dimensional thinking. One of the most absurd moments in sci-fi, in my opinion, comes in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Kirk and Spock are talking about how they're going to defeat Khan in a crippled ship, and Spock notes that, \"[Khan] is intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two-dimensional thinking.\" Kirk has an \"aha!\" moment and realizes that they can out-navigate Khan and come up behind him. And what do they do? They manage to get into a position in which Khan passes over them, and then they sneak the Enterprise up behind him by descending out of the Nebula onto his plane of movement! They don't start shooting until they're perfectly lined up with him. For thinking, you can't get much more two-dimensional than that! How about firing at his underbelly? How about coming at him in such a way that you have a clear view of his saucer section and thus are less likely to miss?But this, of course, is par for the course in Star Trek. Ships are always encountering each other while on the same plane. Never is one \"upside-down\" or \"sideways\" in comparison to the other. There's the absurd \"Neutral Zone,\" which is presented on maps like this......as if you couldn't just, you know, fly over or under it. Star Trek VI has the \"shock wave\" that shoots out from the destruction of Praxis and buffets Sulu's ship when a couple of maneuvering thrusters should have put them over or under it.Other franchises aren't immune to this. If Moff Tarkin had maneuvered the Death Star from a slightly different trajectory, they wouldn't have to \"clear\" Yavin before they could fire on the rebel base. I seem to recall that the \"blockade\" in The Phantom Menace is very planar, too. Only in Farscape and Battlestar Galactica do we start to see battles in which the creators seem to realize that space is three-dimensional. (After writing all of this, I found that TVTropes has a page about this: \"Two-D Space.\")I wish I could say that I've \"returned,\" but my postings are going to continue to be erratic for the next few weeks. Real life won't stop getting in the way. I appreciate your patience in the meantime.Don't let Gary Larson get any ideas from this screen.

Basically, he sat a bunch of people around a table and told them he was going to give them a vision test. In reality, all but one (the subject) of the participants were his confederates. Asch might show two lines, A and B, and ask the participants which one was longer. If everyone else at the table (at Asch's direction) said that Line B was longer than Line A, the subject was also very likely to say so, even if it was patently absurd. The experiment illustrated the enormous pressure to conform with prevailing opinion. However, if even one of the other participants disagreed with the group's consensus, then the subject was also much more likely to disagree and give the correct response. This same phenomenon is illustrated fictionally in Twelve Angry Men, where the dissent of a single juror causes other jurors who had been wrestling internally to voice their doubts.What I would like, right now, is for one person who has played Sentinel Worlds I: Future Magic to post a comment opining that the game sucks.I got into this blog for myself, and yet I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel a certain obligation to my readers. Your comments keep me going. Many of you are very funny, or knowledgeable, or insightful, or all three. I don't want to let you down. So when I get comment after comment, for weeks, telling me how great an upcoming game is, I feel particularly compelled to like it--compelled to conform. Thus, just one of you, confirming my opinion that this game blows goats, would make me feel ever so much better.Oh, I admit that on the surface, Sentinel Worlds seems to have all the elements of a great game. First, it is a spiritual descendant of Starflight, which I loved. Both were by Electronic Arts, although Worlds is clearly set in a different universe. Many of the gameplay elements from the earlier game are here: space exploration and combat, planetside ATV landings, mining for minerals, dialogue options. The game adds a lot of new features to this mix, including Pool of Radiance-style adventurer's journal entries, ground exploration and hand-to-hand combat, and character-based statistics and inventories that make each of the PCs seem like individuals rather than (in Starflight) just parts of the ship.My complaint isn't with the gameplay elements, but rather with the interface. I don't know how anyone stood it long enough to get through an entire game. Let's start with the space navigation screen:You do your flying around in the upper-left-hand corner. See how narrow it is, top to bottom? When you're moving at a decent clip, you're off that screen in a half second. The other ships, which are suspiciously far more maneuverable than you, fly circles around you while you cumbersomely turn and try to see where they're going as they blip off the screen.Ship-to-ship combat is just as bad as Starflight (it was the worst part of that game). Instead of having to face the enemy and shoot, you simply arm lasers and the computer shoots for you--from any angle. That doesn't sound so bad except that you get about three shots before the enemy has sailed off the edge of the screen and you lose the laser lock. Then you have to go hunt him down, hit SPACE to lock on, hit ENTER to arm the lasers, and--whoops! He's off the screen again!Now, when the enemy leaves the screen, you should be able to use the little long-range navigation box to find him. Of course, you have to pick him out from a bunch of other ships that might be in the area. Fortunately, the game helpfully distinguishes enemy ships from friendly ships by color. Red ships are enemies, purple ships are other (friendly) interceptors, and maroon ships are cargo transports. That doesn't pose any problem at all for a color-blind person, especially when each ship is about one pixel in size.Fun with color doesn't stop with ships. You also have to use it to identify the type of terrain in the orbit maps. Irene tells me there are like eight colors represented on this map, and I can see three, maybe four if I squint.Okay, fine, so Electronic Arts couldn't anticipate the needs of colorblind people. This was before computers got all touchy-feely with accessibility. But that still doesn't excuse the indoor navigation maps, which try to combine 3D wireframes and top-down navigation on the same screen and end up making me seasick.Nor does it excuse the hand-to-hand combat system, by which you hit ENTER and watch your crewmembers fight, unable to pause or engage in any specific tactics.Add to this an inability to find mineral deposits on any of the planets I visit, a lack of any direction on the main quest, and a game opening that tosses you in the thick of battle with raiders before you've even had a chance to investigate the interface, and you've got a relatively unpleasant introductory posting to get out of the way. My absence over the last week has primarily been because of work, but it has also been because I was hoping that if I kept playing, I would start to like the game enough that I wouldn't write a posting like this.All right. Let me back up and cover the basics.The plot isn't bad. Set in  2995, the back story is that a trade route between a group of merchant  planets has been beset by mysterious raiders who simply destroy ships  without attempting to contact or loot them. My crew of five......has  recently completed a training program and has been sent to the troubled  area to learn what we can about the raiders and destroy them.Much like Starflight, the crew consists of a pilot, a navigator, a communications officer, an engineer, and a medic. Each has scores for strength, stamina, dexterity, comprehension, and charisma; and each starts with 3 of 12 skills: contact (blunt) weapons, edged weapons, projectile weapons, blasters, tactics, reconnaissance, gunnery, ATV repair, mining, athletics, observation, and bribery. Unlike Starflight, PCs have individual inventories, including weapons and armor. Regrettably, \"budget cuts\" have meant that the federation depending on  the success of my mission could not afford to outfit my crew with basic weapons or anything.I began the game, as I said, in the middle of combat with raiders. At first, I trusted the game's mercy on a new player and assumed I would be able to defeat them.I was wrong.After several restarts, I decided discretion was the better part of valor, and I fled the opening fight, only to return and pick off one of the raiders on the fringes of the battle. I can't emphasize enough how tedious space combat is, as you circle around the enemy, desperately trying to keep him on the screen, as the computer fires your lasers at him. Theoretically, you can target certain parts of the ship (e.g., knock out the engines) and try to board it, engaging with the crew in hand-to-hand combat, but I haven't attempted that yet.It appears that you can get quests from the Federation--ships that need to be escorted, ships that are under attack, and so on.I tried a few of these, but by the time I got to the coordinates, the ships were gone or the attack was over. So instead, I went to the nearby Norjaenn Spaceport (this involves flying over the planet and activating the navigation menu) and got a mission from the Science Foundation to deliver some equipment to another planet.There are only four planets in the area of the galaxy I'm in (I'm unclear whether this is the only area of the game or not), so it didn't take long to find the planet, at which point I simply set down at the indicated coordinates, dropped off the equipment, and made a cool 700 gold pieces.ATV navigation is from a top-down perspective, and is very much like Starflight but with better graphics. You run into animals all over the planet, although you cannot collect them as specimens. The game manual suggests that killing them is bad and healing them (assuming they need it) is good. The ATV breaks down periodically for no reason that I can see except to make you wait while one of your crewmembers fixes it.Some of the planets have \"beacons\" which alert you to the presence of towns. One such planet had a sort of western theme going, with farms and a saloon. Conversation with the patrons in the saloon (you can talk to individuals on the surface as well as other ships) suggested there was some tension between farmers and ranchers.Finding a saloon on a planet gives me a Firefly-ish tingle.Conversations usually offer two or three dialogue options. Unlike modern games, these options aren't so much about role-playing as prioritizing the information you want to collect. The other person eventually cuts off dialogue after a few questions (the same thing happened in Starflight) so you don't want to waste time asking about the weather.So far, most people have been yelling at me to go fight the raiders instead of asking questions about them. My conversations haven't produced any useful intelligence yet, but I've only been to one planet.Thanks, Tasha. Is everyone here as bright as you?I eventually made my way to the planet of Caldorre, where I found three towers of dungeon-crawling fun, each with multiple levels. I really can't see why anyone thought this interface was a good idea.So that's about the thick of it. I took a peek at Barton's review in Dungeons and Desktops, and he says that the game has a \"steep learning curve.\" I really hope that's all it is. I want to like the game, and I've yet to get one of the adventurer's journal entries, so I'm assuming there's a lot of stuff I've yet to explore. Perhaps by the end of my initial six hours, the game and I will have come to some kind of agreement."}, {"title": "Hey, Everybody", "date": "Tuesday, June 28, 2011", "text": "Sorry for the lack of postings lately.

By the way, it turned out to be a weapon. That's so wrong.It would be such an incredible waste of time to continue playing Scavengers of the Mutant World that, for all our sakes, I'm going to stop. But man does it grate to have this game beat me.As I noted in previous postings, the game's primary objective is to return various scavenged goods back to the vault at the city of Lau. Well, I've done that. I've stocked the larders, armory, and tool shed:Yeah, that's a shotgun and a .45 in the shirtless guy's possession.But I still don't have enough parts to build a car or boat, which I think--actually, I know, since I read Scorpia's review after I decided to stop playing--is the key to \"winning\" the game. Apparently, just before the nuclear war, there was only one car and one boat in the immediate area, because each permutation of the game features only one battery, one motor, one exhaust system, and so on. I've collected most of these parts. For the car, I lack gasoline and an axle, and for the boat, I lack gasoline, a propellor, and patches. Meanwhile, I do have all kinds of extra parts: pedals and chain, liquid oxygen, a heater, uranium, an ivory rod, thumb tacks, handlebars, and a hubcap. Clearly, there are some blueprints for a nuclear-powered, pedal driven space shuttle that I've yet to stumble upon.(Oh, by the way, correctly identifying the parts in the blueprint depends on the character's intelligence attribute, which is why Homer thought my car needed an anchor.)You'd think I could just keep exploring ruins until I find the missing items, but there are a couple of reasons why I would go insane first. The primary one is that instead of a character development system, this game features a \"punish-characters-for-developing\" system. You see, it turns out I was wrong about no levels or experience. You don't see those things, but your characters apparently do increase in levels as you slay mutants and monsters; this is evidenced by slowly increasing maximum hit points and radiation points. As you increase levels, however, the game starts throwing harder and harder monsters at you, including some who irradiate you with every attack. You eventually get to the point where it's easier to return to base and dump your high-level characters in exchange for low-level peons just so you can go back to fighting rabid bunnies again.Wasn't kidding.The monsters don't just get harder in the amount of damage they do; they also get more annoying. They eat my food, leaving me to starve, steal my items, and poison me. You can't escape them; they move faster than you, and even fleeing combat just puts you five or six spaces away from them, and they promptly attack you again.Second, the further you get from home base, the more the ruins suck. Many of them are completely dark and require lamps to navigate--lamps last about 10 moves. Some are filled with radiation zones. I've counted about 19 ruins in the game map I've already explored--you have an automap, incidentally.......and since each part exists only once, in one square (possibly darkened), in one ruin, it'll take me many hours to explore them all, even with the occasional dungeon map that you find:This would be the one ruin I didn't really need a map for.I'm not sure I have hours and hours, because I only have about six scavengers left. The others have all died from monsters, radiation storms, starvation, or poison. I don't miss them. This game teaches you to not think of your characters as a real \"party\" but as interchangeable bags of meat that you simply send out to find loot. However, none of the remaining characters have a very high intelligence score, and I suspect this is necessary to correctly assemble the parts, should I manage to find them all before the rest of my characters die.I have found some reasonably cool weapons, including handguns, shotguns, and spear guns. But missile weapons are hardly worth it because they burn through your minimum supply of ammo so fast. You have to keep a backup hand weapon and notice when your ammunition runs out in combat.I've also found a lot of tools in the game, and I wish I could figure out how to get most of them to work. Jackhammers bore holes through walls--that's easy enough--and teaching machines raise your stats. Decontamination and healing kits do the obvious. I wish I knew the purpose of ladders and shovels. Late in the game, I found a couple of \"flying mounts\" which refuse to fly over anything.Anyway, I'm not starting with a brand new party and map, so I'll play these characters to victory or death. But I'll give you a quick final rating now in case it's death [later edit: yep.].In my first posting, I talked about my visceral reaction to the game world, but I can't deny that it's fairly original--this might be the first post-apocalyptic CRPG (I don't know if Wasteland from the same year is before or after). The state of the land and your quest is fairly clear (4).For a game with such limited character creation--the game rolls their stats and picks their portraits and names when it generates the world, although you can change them--it's funny how this game gives you the option to edit the portraits pixel by pixel. Hardly any other game offers this level of visual customization, yet it's hard to imagine anyone taking the time to do it. Character development, for reasons I've said, is maddening (3).There are no NPCs in the game (0). Encounters feature foes with different strengths and weaknesses (3), but there are far too many of them, and combat offers so few tactics that you can't really adjust well to specific enemies. The combat mechanics are quite awful, with all of the turning and advancing--one turn or step per round--that you have to do (3).The various types of equipment--weapons, armor, food, tools, and parts--that you can find, wield, and use is probably the game's strong suit. A numbering system suggests which weapons and armor are better (4), but there is no economy in the game (0).The game fakes you out a bit on the quests. The manual suggests that you'll be rewarded for returning food and weapons and such to the vault, but I saw no sign of this, and the only real quest seems to be the collection of parts for a vehicle. I wish I knew what happened after that--does building a car end the game?--but I doubt it offers any role-playing options. Still, it gets one point for originality (3).The graphics, as you see, are pretty terrible. Aside from the colors, there are only four or five monster icons; one for water creatures, one for insects, one for humanoids, and so on. There is some bloopish sound that you immediately turn off, and the keyboard commands are cumbersome. There are only 29 possibilities, and I suspect through consolidation they could have mapped each one to a letter (like Ultima IV) instead of requiring me to type D-A for \"date,\" D-F for \"distribute food,\" D-I for \"dismount,\" D-O for \"don armor,\" and D-R for \"drop\" (1).I suppose in the gameplay category, I should give some credit for replayability. If you really love this game (you loser), you could keep generating new maps and play all 4 million possibilities. And I allow that movement is fairly linear throughout the game world. But, man, does it drag. If they'd just put two of each part on the map--and maybe made the encounters a little harder to compensate--it would go more quickly and be more tolerable (3).Against my better judgement, I'm going to add two bonus points to the final score to reward the game for its original use of radiation. Whether through storms, walking through radiated areas, or fighting radiated monsters, it's fun to see the various negative (stupidity, blindness, instant death at the next irradiation, attribute drains) and positive (laser eyes, attribute increases, double speed, radiation immunity) effects that radiation confers in the game:This brings the final score to 26, the same as Questron II, which was bad for different reasons.Word from reviews at the time suggests that Scavengers was originally designed as a board game. It feels a bit like that. Barton (p. 122) says that \"it's almost worth seeking the game out just to see how badly developers can bungle a promising concept.\" True words. I'm glad I sought it out, wish I could have finished, but not enough to roll a new game world.If one of you would like to download and play the game until you can assemble the vehicle, and send me a screenshot and description of the ending, I'll give you 1 million points and the right to name my next main character or party leader. In the meantime, I'll be playing Sentinel Worlds I: Future Magic."}, {"title": "Well, I Don't Know What I Expected", "date": "Wednesday, June 22, 2011", "text": "Every bloody online review that I read mentions being able to use stop signs as shields. I don't think any of these people have actually played the game. As far as I can tell, this occurs only on the cover. I have yet to find any shield--stop sign or otherwise--in the game, and the manual doesn't even mention shields.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Fair warning: this is a light one.

If it drags on much longer, I'll start Sentinel Worlds.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I thought every famous TV clip was posted to YouTube, but I guess the producers of Arrested Development have issues with that, because I couldn't find the clip I really wanted to lead this post with. In it, Michael opens up his refrigerator and finds a bag with \"Dead Dove. Do not eat!\" written on the outside. Curious, he opens it up, looks inside, grimaces, and says, completely deadpan: \"Well, I don't know what I expected.\"TVTropes.org calls this trope \"Exactly What It Says in the Tin.\" The entry leads off with a great quote from Roger Ebert:Moviegoers who knowingly buy a ticket for The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor are going to get exactly what they expect: There is a mummy, a tomb, a dragon, and an emperor. And the movie about them is all that it could be.Other famous examples are, of course, Snakes on a Plane, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, and my favorite, The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies.They have a few entries for video games, but the best possible example--Scavengers of the Mutant World--isn't one of them. This is an outrage, really. You don't get any more literal than that: in the game, you play a bunch of scavengers, who--and this comes as no surprise--live in a mutant world. It doesn't try to fool you like, oh, Star Command. What the hell is that about? Do you get to boss Bruce Willis around? Are you the head of a public works team on Hollywood Boulevard? Do you utter lines like, \"Evacuate?! In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances\"? Ultima? Isn't that a Nissan model? Phantasie--oh, that helps. You jackasses can't even spell it right. But this game: It's set in a mutant world. You scavenge. Don't like the sound of it? Don't buy the goddamned game.I could go through the list and identify games that are good examples of this trope (Rogue Clone is particularly notable), but I was actually more interested in the opposite: games that have utterly baffling or inappropriate names. Here's a sample:Baldur's Gate II: Sure, it's a sequel to Baldur's Gate, but it doesn't take place anywhere near the city of that name. The Elder Scrolls: Arena is notable for not having an arena, nor having anything to do with an arena (not to mention any scrolls). The story, apparently, is that the game was supposed to be about gladiatorial combat but it changed in the development stage. No one told the marketing department.The cover even has a bunch of warriors in an arena. I'd like to see someone try to battle in that outfit, incidentally.Pool of Radiance: As I noted in my review, the eponymous pool is never well-explained and really plays no role in the game. As in Arena, one senses changes between concept and execution.NetHack: Doesn't it sound like a game about, I don't know, hacking? Over a network? Yes, I understand the history of the name, but that doesn't make it any more sensible.Neverwinter Nights: The first word has no problem--it's definitely set in the city of Neverwinter. The problem is the overall title, which sounds like it's suggesting you get to explore the seamy underbelly of Neverwinter when the sun goes down. Instead, the city is in the grip of a plague, and there's nothing special about the nightFaery Tale Aventure: Book I. Awfully cocky, weren't you?Yeah, so I didn't really have a lot of time tonight. What are some of your favorites in either category?"}, {"title": "Scavengers of the Mutant World: Flying Fish and Laser Vision", "date": "Tuesday, June 21, 2011", "text": "Nice outfit, gimp.Scavengers of the Mutant World is not a good game--I know this without question--but somehow it's got me in its vise. God help me, I want to win this one. It feels like it shouldn't take that long, either. It's just hard. I've restarted three new games since I last posted (and no more naming my own characters or swapping portraits--it takes too long).My understanding of the \"quest\" is that I need to bring various items and parts back to Lau and to assemble the parts, using sets of blueprints, into working machines. I don't know how many items, parts, and machines I need to collect, but I've barely gotten started.Note the wheels and the drive axle in the storeroom.In two of the scenarios, I found some blueprints early on that listed the parts needed for a car:An anchor?The parts are scattered about the different ruins, and I don't know if they're randomized or fixed in the game world. I also don't know if there's just one of each or more, but I've only found one of each so far. In my last scenario, I had the shaft, oil, axle, and exhaust system, but my main party died in a radiation storm--a bolt of lightning killed them instantly--and my relief party was slaughtered by junkyard dogs while trying to retrieve their stuff. I could have continued, but I had lost 8 out of 20 scavengers, and since I was still mostly just exploring the game, I decided to start anew.Frermynd gets her hands on a shaft.In addition to weapons, armor, parts, and food, you find several usable items scattered about the world. One, a \"teaching machine,\" increased attributes for my characters the two times that it worked. Another, a \"decontamination unit,\" was helpful for restoring my radiation points.I'm not sure how a \"teaching machine\" increases strength. Perhaps it's a shake-weight.The manual had warned about radiation storms. Generally, they're dangerous and cause loss of attribute points, or death. But in one memorable storm, one of my characters mutated to shoot laser beams out of her eyes. It was useful in the next few combats. If The Day After had featured such plot points, I'm not sure I would have feared a nuclear holocaust so much.Knowing the exact distance and direction to the nearest ruin is important for when radiation storms come along.The monsters turned out to be the type you would expect in a post-apocalyptic nightmare: mutants, scavengers from rival tribes, giant spiders, insect abominations. They seem to start off easy and get a lot tougher as the game progresses. I'm not sure if this is because I'm getting farther from Lau, or because the game senses you're approaching the completion of a goal and ramps up the difficulty.I took video of a brief bit of gameplay below. Despite its brevity, you see a lot of gameplay here: wandering around Lau, engaging some mutant fish, finding some food, weathering a radiation storm and getting laser vision, using a decontamination unit, and starting to explore a new ruin called Ceniste.The game, I should also mention, automatically saves every couple of  turns. There's no quitting and reloading if something unpleasant  happens.I'm determined to keep at it until I can at least put together a car. I've also noted, in my quest for original reviews and ads for the game (mentioned yesterday), that there are few sites that have any detail about Scavengers. No matter how much I write, other sites will probably always have more information about Ultima IV and Pool of Radiance, but I can still be the authoritative source on obscure games like Scavengers."}, {"title": "Game 59: Scavengers of the Mutant World (1988)", "date": "Monday, June 20, 2011", "text": "Scavengers of the Mutant WorldUnited StatesInterstel Corporation (developer and publisher)Released 1988 for DOSDate Started: 20 June 2011\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Post-apocalyptic films and games have always held a certain joylessness for me. I grew up in an era in which the threat of a thermonuclear war, while waning, was very real. No film has ever scared me as much as The Day After, which I saw when I was 11. I remember a teacher speaking about the TV movie afterwards, and his basic thesis was that a) having already discovered and built nuclear weapons, the world would never not have them again; and b) although the odds were low in any given year that a nuclear missile would be launched, every passing year increased the cumulative probability, making it ultimately inevitable. (My schooling in these years, if it is not immediately clear, was in Texas.) Thanks to him and the movie, I was not only convinced that a nuclear war would happen in my lifetime, I desperately hoped I would die in the initial blast. Other films like Def-Con 4, The Road Warrior, and The Terminator were equally bleak in their promises of a a grimy, radiation-poisoned, brutish aftermath.For years, thinking about nuclear war was my personal version of The Game (sorry, everyone). I would go as long as possible, try to muster some enthusiasm about life, make plans for my future, but ultimately my brain would remind me, \"Oh, hey--nuclear war!,\" and I would descend into a depression that might last several days or several weeks. Fortunately, when I was a sophomore in high school, I read a horribly uninformed newspaper column about why we shouldn't worry about nuclear war, and it was somehow enough to convince me to stop thinking about it long enough for the Soviet Union to collapse. I now occasionally worry about a terrorist using a nuclear bomb, but I no longer worry about dozens of ICBMs cris-crossing continents. It would be kind of you to refrain from postings explaining why I should, in fact, still worry about such things.Anyway, this is hardly the stuff of fantasy, and the last thing I ever wanted to do was play games set in such worlds. I'm just coming to realize this now. Some remnant of the horror of The Day After must have always stuck with me, because I never bothered to play any of the Fallout games (despite liking Interplay's and Bethesda's other titles) or Wasteland, or any post-nuclear CRPGs. (I did play the strategy game Roadwar 2000 as a kid, but that occurred after a plague, not a nuclear bomb.) This is my first.I typed much of the above while I was waiting for the game to create a \"world disk.\" The manual says that it randomizes the world (choosing from among more than 4 million possibilities) each time you start a game.Scavengers takes place after a nuclear war destroys most of humanity and leaves the surface world a mutant-ridden, radioactive wasteland. Descendants of survivors live in an underground city called Lau, actually the remains of a fallout shelter. Its founding documents note, mythologically, that \"the First Ones, having a considerable source of wealth known as 'Government Funding,' built this shelter.\"Every year, a group of colonists--winners of a contest--journeys to the surface world to scavenge for loot for the colony. Battling mutant creatures and radiation storms, they hope to return with furniture, armor, weapons, food (?), and pieces of vehicles. I am to lead such a party.The manual is quite extensive, 60 pages long, and it meticulously describes the types of weapons, armor, terrain, medical issues, and creatures you're likely to encounter on the surface. In an amusing bit of tautology, the manual warns of ants large enough to eat oxen. Then, in the mammals section, it notes that there are few mammals left and hardly any have been seen. But, it reasons, \"if there are ants that can eat oxen, there must certainly be oxen, too.\"Editing and selecting characters.The game vaguely reminded me of Dungeon Master in the opening stages. You command a party of four characters, but you don't create them yourself; rather, you choose from a list of 20 pre-generated shelter-dwellers. You can modify each character's portrait (with a pixel-editor, even!) and name, much as you can when you \"reincarnate\" a character in DM, but you're stuck with the attributes. These are the standard D&D  list, minus constitution and plus \"observation.\" In addition to hit points, you have \"radiation points\" that you want to keep above 0, else you suffer disease and mutation--although some mutations, apparently, can be helpful.In naming my characters, I chose two commenters, a fictional reference, and one name from Karnov's random name generator.The game starts you in the ruins of Lau and allows you to scavenge some items nearby, including weapons, armor, parts, and blueprints (I got plans for a car, for instance). Right away, it hurts its own mythology by having you find bows and armor like chainmail--where would this have come from, either pre- or post-apocalypse?The number pad moves you around, but other commands are chosen from a list of 29 through a somewhat cumbersome means of typing the first two letters, then hitting ENTER, then specifying the character to perform it. So picking up an item requires a sequence like: G-R-[ENTER]-3 (the \"GR\" is for \"Grab\"). There are shortcuts but they work in combination with CTRL, SHIFT, and the function keys, which doesn't work so well in DOSBox.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fighting \"Walking Grass,\" which looks like a mutant dandelion.Combat takes place on a tactical map that initially seems a little like Pool of Radiance. Each character becomes a distinct person and moves separately from the others. But the differences soon become apparent. First, there are only four options in combat: move one square, turn and face a different direction, attack, and parry. Second, you can only do one of these things each round, so getting from the starting location to actually stand face-to-face with the enemy might take five or six rounds. After combat, hit points regenerate fairly quickly.Today, I explored Lau and a little of the environs, but almost immediately I ran into a radiation storm and one of my characters got slaughtered:Radiation storms have both positive and negative effects.You do have some warning of said storms, so I guess the trick is to  always know where the closest shelter is.This game could go either way, but I'm leaning on the side of not liking it much. There doesn't seem to be any character development in the game; battles don't get you experience and there are no \"levels\" (at least, the manual doesn't mention either). You're not limited to sticking with the original 4 party members, and there is some suggestion in the manual that you will eventually have to use all 20 for various purposes. But I am interested in finding out what all these parts and blueprints do, so I'll stick with it for a while longer.In the meantime, I'll owe a drink to anyone who can find me either an original ad or an original review for this game. I want to start looking these up for each game that I play, but Computer Gaming World doesn't seem to have reviewed it, and the game doesn't otherwise have much of an online presence.\"Radiation storms\" are just the kind of thing I used to fear. If I really \"role-played\" this one, I'd just have my characters opt for a blissful death in the sea."}, {"title": "Questron II: Final Rating", "date": "Sunday, June 19, 2011", "text": "This game has the least effective copy protection of any game I've ever played.

The time-travel angle is also unusual, but again poorly implemented. The world itself is a collection of towns, castles, and terrain features no different from Britannia or Ymros. You do have a lengthy history and lore in the manual, they're just not all that interesting; \"stop the evil wizard\" had already become a cliche by 1988. And the looting castles and slaughtering guards bit bothers me. Didn't Ultima IV teach us anything? Score: 3.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 2. Character Creation and Development. The only real option you have when creating your character is the name. Leveling occurs at fixed intervals and in response to progress on the quest, not slaying monsters or building experience. You have no choices when leveling. You can increase some of your stats in dungeons or by purchasing training in castles, but basically every player ends the game with the same character as every other player. Score: 2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3. NPC Interaction. No games are really rocking us yet with NPC interaction, but Questron II still feels like a throwback to a few years prior, when NPCs gave a single line of exposition. It's even worse here because most wandering NPCs say something worthless (\"Me not like you\") as if they were straight out of Ultima II. You do get some plot points from barbers, innkeepers, and publicans, but not enough to really advance the plot--most of the stuff they tell you, you'd figure out anyway. There are no dialogue options, not even when dealing with the main quest NPCs. Score: 2.And if you're going to make a Treasure of the Sierra Madre reference, at least put it in some kind of context.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 4. Encounters and Foes. We just came across a game--Pool of Radiance--that advanced the concept of \"encounters\" light years, and in this game, we might as well still be playing Akalabeth. Despite descriptions in the manual and interesting names, the monsters are utterly unmemorable, and there are no episodes in which you have to make any kind of real decision. Usually I like games that offer random encounters and respawning, but only when there's some point to fighting, and there's no point to fighting in this game: you don't get any experience, and you get more gold from gambling and dungeon exploration. Score: 1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This kind of encounter wasn't even fun the very first time.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 5. Magic and Combat. Combat consists of hitting \"F\" over and over, and the magic system offers exactly four spells. I'm seriously contemplating giving this game a 0, but the only game I've done that for is Braminar in which you literally make no decisions in combat. I guess that here, you at least have to pick the best out of four spells. Score: 1.6. Equipment. We've seen lots of games with limited equipment, but this is the only game I've played in which your available equipment is tied to your character level, which makes no sense even on the surface. The best I can say is that at least you can tell, based on the price, when you're getting an upgrade. If I consider transportation as part of equipment, though, I have to give the game some points for the flying eagle. Score: 3.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Keeganac's gear at the end. The game's best weapon, as far as I can tell, is the broadsword.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 7. Economy. There are quite a lot of things to buy in the game--stat upgrades, healing herbs, weapons and armor, spells, hit points, food, transportation, information. And I like the gambling mini-games; there aren't many games that feature mini-games in this era. But the game unbalances itself with high returns on gambling, making it pointless to accumulate treasure through combat or dungeon exploration. Having tens of thousands of gold pieces likely made the end game much easier for me than the creators intended. Score: 5.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Gambling is not supposed to absolve you from actually playing the game.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 8. Quest. There is one relatively boring main quest but no \"side quests.\" There is only one outcome to the main quest, and no opportunities for role-playing at all. Score: 2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 9. Graphics, Sound, and Inputs. I'm almost scared to rate anything in this category now. The graphics are a nice upgrade from Questron and Legacy of the Ancients, but the sound is still primitive and I mostly kept it off. The keyboard commands were mostly intuitive enough, but there's no excuse, in this era, for disallowing diagonal movement--especially when your enemies can both move and attack you on the diagonal. I'm going to give it an extra point for the automap, probably the game's only innovative feature. Score: 5.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 10. Gameplay. Questron II is completely linear. You have to visit each dungeon and castle in a particular order. Towns are an exception, but the game's dozens of towns are essentially interchangeable. Although I admire its quick resolution (again, I think the creators intended more monster grinding and less gambling), the game is a bit too easy. (Among other things, resurrection is immediate and guaranteed upon death.) There would be absolutely no reason to replay it. Score: 2. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The final score of 26 almost seems too high. I think I might revisit my system soon to allow for a \"discretionary\" category where I can add and subtract points based on particularly well-done (or hated) features. It's time for an updated GIMLET review anyway; the one I keep linking to is from over a year ago and it talks about The Bard's Tale in the intro.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Note: Nothing this ad says is actually true.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Earlier today, reader Macnol was kind enough to link to the issue of Computer Gaming World in which Questron II was reviewed. The review's last sentence (p. 50) sums up the game perfectly: \"Bottom line: Not equal to the original; best for the beginner, not the experienced.\"Next up: I couldn't find a working version of the 1988 edition of Rogue Clone (which, by all descriptions, was pretty much a clone of Rogue; who would have guessed?), so it's on to Scavengers of the Mutant World."}, {"title": "Questron II: Won!", "date": "Saturday, June 18, 2011", "text": "And boy are they happy about it!Well, I'll give Questron II this: it doesn't wear out its welcome. It's the first game I've played since Akalabeth in which I won before hitting my six-hour minimum. It never got a lot better, although it did unveil some interesting features towards the end. Let me take it chronologically.When we last left the game, I had been transported to the other continent on the planet of Landor, called the Realm of the Sorcerers. It wasn't much different from the first continent except that the random encounters in the wild were more frequent and did more damage. Fortunately, this didn't last long.I set out exploring the continent--I already had a rough map from the Room of Maps in Castle Redstone--and got some slightly better weapons and armor. One of the \"travel\" shops had a boat for sale, which I bought and sailed back to the first continent to make sure I wasn't due a level up from Mesron. The boat, oddly, didn't seem to have cannons, so when I met a creature I was still attacking it with my melee weapon.Presumably, I'm hanging off the side or something.It was a good thing I returned, because I was due a promotion, which got me some stat bumps and a new key:As before, when I reached the new level, I not only got a new hit point maximum (600), but new weapons (axe), armor (chain mail), and transports became available to me.What a \"camalon\" is will have to remain a mystery.One of the transport options was a \"trained eagle,\" on whose back I soared! Not only did this take the place of the boat, but it prevented me from having any random encounters in the wilderness. That fact alone did a lot to get the game back into my good graces.The Realm of the Sorcerers turned out to have four places to explore: a tomb in Twilight Cathedral, a \"great fortress,\" an unnamed dungeon, and the Dungeons of Despair. At first, I thought the game was opening up its linearity, but it turned out I needed keys to enter both the tomb and the Dungeons of Despair, and my initial raid on the fortress was aborted because I couldn't get through locked doors, so it really turned out that the map was completely linear, requiring me to visit the unnamed dungeon, the fortress, the Twilight Cathedral tomb, and the Dungeons of Despair in that order. Fortunately, at least, there wasn't a lot of backtracking.Who is actually telling me this?The dungeon was three-dimensional, and exactly as I remembered from Legacy of the Ancients. There are traps, and you have to search every hallway to make sure you don't hit them. Chests provide food, gold, and items. Occasionally, you find a healing potion or a coffin that effects a statistic increase. And of course there are monsters, but far fewer here than I remember from Legacy.For god's sake, just call it an \"umber hulk.\" That's clearly what it is.Then something unexpected happened: I found something called a \"Scroll of Scalna,\" which provided an automatic automap on the right side of the screen. It's the most sophisticated automap I've seen in a CRPG so far, showing doors, traps, coffins, and potions (if you don't pick up the latter two) as well as pits to go up and down. And it's integrated to the main screen--you don't have to call it up with a separate command. It remembers levels (which do not respawn items) after you leave. Well done, Questron II!The Shape Shifter, oddly enough, does not actually shift his shape.Anyway, I found an Agate Key and an Onyx Key during my exploration of the eight levels of the dungeon. It wasn't a tough dungeon to explore. There were a few areas inaccessible unless you went down and back up again, but nothing tough, and rendered all the easier by the automap. When I got out, I headed for the fortress and, resignedly, launched into an attack of another castle's worth of luckless guards.Looting the castle gained me some other keys. I left and returned and was able to march on in to see the king. I was about to remark that the guards have very short memories--they don't attack if you just leave and return--but I guess since I slaughtered them all, the more remarkable thing is how fast the castle is able to replenish its staff.Just as in the first Questron, instead of ordering me executed for my needless massacre, the king--Kelfar, which is one letter off from Legacy's Kelfor--respected my power, increased my stats, gave me 5000 gold, and appointed me his champion.I meant to reload and find out what happens if you say \"No.\"I figured that meant yet another level bump, so I got on my eagle and returned to Castle Redstone. There, an interesting thing happened: Mesrom told me that Mantor was attacking one of the cities.I couldn't remember where Cramford was, so it took a while to find it. When I did, it was properly destroyed. All the people had turned to piles of bones, and the whole place had a red tinge. It reminded me how the sorceress had destroyed towns in Shard of Spring, and I wonder if, had the game taken me longer, Mantor would have hit other towns.With the key from Kelfar's fortress, I entered the Twilight Cathedral tombs, which were almost exactly like the tombs in the other continent. Fortunately, I had that map, which made the exploration of the very maze-y (but curiously monster-light) dungeon much easier. The only plot item was the discovery of the Black Key.I read this as \"ASS OF PAIN\" at first.Returning again to Redstone, I was informed Mantor was attacking another city--Seaside--which, fortunately, I remembered where it was. When I got there, Mantor sicced the guards on me, but all I had to do was fling one fireball at him, and he fled like a bitch. The town reverted to normal and everything was cool.Mesron promoted me to knight and sent me on the final quest to the Dungeons of Despair.Before heading into the dungeon, I went shopping and found I could buy 2000 hit points! (More on this in a minute.) I got a fauchard as a weapon and ribbed plate mail for armor. The Holy One at Twilight Cathederal sold me 30 loaves of that healing bread. I loaded up on spells and headed into the Dungeons of Despair, which were also 3D.As I explored the dungeon and drilled downward, I noticed that the healing potions I was finding kept adding to my hit points. Before, they wouldn't allow me to go over a maximum, but at this level, I kept going up--3000, 4000, 5000--and so I wasn't even particularly worried when a trap destroyed my armor and I started taking massive damage from monsters.I got all the way to the bottom and into a fortress (no longer 3D) where Mantor and the sorcerers were creating the book. But the damned place hit me with 40-50 hit points damage for every step, not to mention what the guards were doing. I soon died.This shot is from my second visit.I realized the game had changed the rules on me. Where before there was a hit point maximum, in the endgame, the goal was to get to Mantor's place with as many hit points as possible. With that in mind, I reloaded and checked out the hit point store again. It turned out that the 2000 hit point offer wasn't a one-time thing. Every time I entered the town, I could go to the store and buy another 2000. I spent all the rest of my gold.In the dungeon, I cast \"Time Sap\" every time I saw a monster and killed him before he could even hit me, and I took advantage of every potion I could find. By the time I reached the bottom-level sanctuary again, I had over 15,000 hit points.The video records the last couple levels of the dungeon and my assault on the wizards in Mantor's sanctuary. When I reached Mantor and the Evil Book of Magic, I was able to kill the six insane sorcerers, but none of my attacks or spells would do anything against Mantor himself. Nor could I pick up the book. I bumbled about a bit, trying to use different objects I had aquired (I still have no idea what the Unicorn's Horn or Crystal Goblet were about) before I finally hit upon using my copy of the Evil Book of Magic, in which there was now a \"Destruct\" spell.Mantor \"flickered and vanished\" despite the game's assertion that destroying the book wouldn't change the past.The end game sequence wasn't as good as I remembered in Questron, but I did get a nice promotion on both planets.And the last screen promised a sequel that never materialized:I'm glad it didn't, because the plot already sounded stupid--why is a child playing in dungeon ruins?This posting is already too long to do the GIMLET here, so look for that tomorrow. For now, I'll just say that Questron II helped cure my guilt for not playing Questron last year, since it's pretty much the same game. It's harmless enough, I guess--a good option for beginners--but I'm looking forward to moving on to something meatier."}, {"title": "Questron II: Massacre", "date": "Friday, June 17, 2011", "text": "How dare these guards do their jobs by stopping me from looting their liege's estate?We need to consider what the creator of the Questron and Legacy of the Ancients series has against castle guards. Was he sodomized by Beefeaters as a child? In all three games, you are forced to advance by going on murderous rampages through castles whose denizens are actively helping you. This one goes even further by actually leaving visible corpses in your wake.Ah, my old nemesis, Locked Door, we meet again. Clearly, none of my fireball spells will do anything against you.The game follows the general schtick of its predecessors by having only a couple of locations and forcing you to travel back and forth between them multiple times. In Legacy of the Ancients, I complained about making repeated raids on Castle Kelfor, each time picking up something that I had to take to another location to get something that would take me back to Castle Kelfor. In this game, the linear dependencies were between Castle Redstone, Rivercrest Cathedral, and Rivercrest Tomb. Let me see if I can remember the specific steps:In Rivercrest Tomb, I found a Moonstone Amulet that let me through a mystical barrier in Rivercrest Cathedral and speak to the \"Holy One,\" who sold me the \"Bread of Life\" (basically healing potions) that made it possible to survive a long trip through the Tomb. (Later, I found a chalice that, when given to the Holy One, increased the amount of bread he was willing to sell.)The \"help\" turned out to consist of getting out of the way.Returning to Rivercrest Tomb, I found a Brass Key.The Brass Key opened a door in Castle Redstone, leading me to various treasure chests. Looting these chests roused the ire of the guards, leading to the aforementioned slaughter.Some of the chests in Redstone contained Iron, Brass, and Copper keys.Apparently, the copper key was very heavy, and I picked it up and put it down 300 times.The Emerald Key opened a heretofore impassable door in Rivercrest Tomb, beyond which I found the Wand of Power. The Wand of Power, shown to Mesron in Castle Redstone, got me elevated to \"scout.\"Being a scout was enough to take the Orb of Enchantment from Castle Redstone (before, it kept saying, \"Come back when you are better!\").Bringing the Orb to Morle the Magician in Rivercrest Tombs, I was transported to the Realm of Sorcerers, the second continent.As you can see, this required me to go back and forth between these two locations about six times, making Questron II a rare game that both is completely linear and involves a lot of backtracking.I videoed some of the game and uploaded it below, so you can see a little of what it's like to play it.In the video, you can see me check my inventory, enter a town, play a few hands of blackjack, check out the armor shop, buy some spells and food, get a tip at an inn, donate at a temple, enter the Tomb, and blast a few monsters with fireballs. Note how quickly my food decreases as I walk through the dungeon. Either each food unit represents, like, one Cheerio, or my character is a real glutton.Oh, a few other notes while I'm in the mood for bullets:You can't just go charging down dungeon corridors by holding the arrow keys. Monsters appear very suddenly, and then can get 5 or 6 free whacks at you while the buffer clears.They also tend to appear in large batches.Monsters are basically indistinguishable. Yes, each one has a little icon, but all they do is hit you. There might have well have just been one creature called \"monster.\"A guy in Castle Redstone sold me stat upgrades--one per level--for a lot of money, but with my knowledge of gambling, money is no object.A hideous pluck! Am I getting attacked by a giant chicken?In the castle was a \"Hall of Maps,\" where I was shown screenshots of two continents and a dungeon for 1,000 gold pieces. I don't know if this means there are only two continents in the game or what.I do suspect this screen shot is going to come in handy.Possible inventory is tied to your level. Only after I became a scout did I gain the \"ability\" to buy \"bar armor,\" a mule, and time sap and sonic whine spells.So now I'm on a second continent, with a bunch of towns and stuff that seem rather the same as the first continent. Is it too much to hope that I'm halfway through the game?Wasting time killing monsters outdoors remains pointless with the imbalanced gambling systems.  But I regard this as a good thing: Honestly, I can't imagine how much I'd hate this game if I had to spend hours grinding against Vivid Fishes and Boring Shrubs (thanks!). I can't say that I haven't died a few times, but this is still fundamentally an easy game. It is devoid of complexity in mapping, tactics, puzzles, NPCs, encounters, magic, or role-playing.

(publisher)Released 1988 for Apple II, Apple II GS, Atari ST, Amiga, and DOSDate Started: 12 June 2011\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Questron II is a sequel to a game that I didn't play as part of this blog, but it was the first CRPG that I ever did play, way back in the mid-1980s. [Ed.: I later rectified this mistake and played it.] When I started playing, I didn't even own it. I'm not sure I even had my own C64. But I was over at this other kid's house and I saw him playing it, and somehow I managed to convince him to leave me alone in his room while he went off and did something else for the afternoon. I was hooked.Later, I must have gotten a C64, or gotten this particular game, because I have a vivid memory of playing the game in my room and winning a boatload of money at roulette. I was so excited, I ran out of the room to tell my mother. I remember shouting something like, \"Mom! I'm playing this game where the most money you ever have is like seventy-five gold pieces, and I just won two thousand!\" She said something like, \"Uh....great, honey!\" while doubtlessly contemplating the likelihood that she would never have grandchildren.I'll also forever be grateful to Questron for teaching me what a \"mace\" is. When I first saw that you could buy \"mace\" in a weapons shop, I imagined you were buying the chemical spray. It kind of spoiled the immersion for me. I mentioned this to my friend and he called me a \"retard\" but fortunately explained what it really was.There are three other things I remember about the game:Your character is a peasant who works his way up in the world.Different weapons are good for different monsters.When I won, there was an extended end-game sequence that showed you paraded through a castle and being lauded by the king or something. For me, this set the bar for end games, and I was usually disappointed in future games by how little they gave me.Writing all of this, I again feel like a bit of a berk for not playing it on this blog. What was my excuse? It didn't have a DOS release? I wish I could go back in time and slap the me of February 2010. (Though it turns out if I did, I still wouldn't have played Questron--see below.) For now, suffice to say that Questron was based on the style of Ultima (Barton says they even licensed the \"style and structure\" of Garriott's game). In the casino games and stat upgrade games, it featured the first mini-games of any CRPG, I think. These are all things that carried over to Legacy of the Ancients, which I did play here.The plot of Questron wasn't all that compelling. You have to build up your character so you can take on the lamely-named Mantor, who rules over the even-more-lamely-named Land of Evil with his epically-lamely-named Evil Book of Magic. When licensing the \"style and structure\" from Ultima, the creators apparently decided this included the needless slaughter of dozens of hapless castle guards, because such massacres feature prominently in both Questron and Legacy. In Questron, the castle's king even knights you for it.As Questron II opens, a wizard named Mesron is telling me that yeah, Mantor is dead, but his Evil Book of Magic is still around, and it's \"so evil that it cannot be destroyed by normal means.\" Moreover, \"its very presence, anywhere in our continuum, poses the threat of corruption and doom to all civilizations.\" That's some evil. His solution? Send me back in time to the planet of Landor, where the book was created by six \"mad sorcerers,\" and stop its creation. Unfortunately, like the Terminator, I can't take any weapons with me, and the trip will \"cause the loss of some of my Questron-renowned power.\" This is the game's way of saying that I'll get kicked back to Level 1.We have to pause to consider the game's understanding of time travel, which according to Morle the Magician is quite common among sorcerers. I was a bit worried that if I stopped the creation of the book, Mantor would never rise to power, and I'd revert to a poor peasant. But according to Morle, \"Going back in time to prevent an event can do nothing to alter the years between the event and the moment you move back through time. Only the future after your departure will be altered.\" Right. So let's work this out. Someone invents a time machine in 2012. You jump in and go back to November 22, 1963, run up to the sixth floor, and wrestle Oswald to the floor before he can shoot. But Kennedy still dies because, after all, you can't change the past. You return to 2012, and then, suddenly, Kennedy is alive. Only he's 95, so he probably just keels over.So if I could go back 16 months and convince February 2010 me to just get a C64 emulator already and play Questron, I still wouldn't play it, but returning to June 2011, I would suddenly find a saved game on my hard drive. Man, time travel messes with the mind.There's other stuff about the back story that we need to talk about, but you've all suffered long enough without any screen shots. Character creation consists of nothing more than giving your character a name, after which the game kindly recounts the story from the first Questron:A disembodied voice explains that I'm on my way to another planet, Landor. \"Although you are now a baron on Questron,\" the voice tells me. \"You will have no title on Landor. Gather your strength. Marshal your allies. Learn where the sorcerers are and how to attack them. Remember your people and good luck.\" I wake up with a dagger, a suit of rawhide armor, a gold key, and the Evil Book of Magic, which for some reason they have sent with me. I am immediately attacked by something called a \"Mavin,\" which the game manual describes as an ape-like creature.Killing it with my sword takes a quarter of my hit points, so I duck into the town north of me.Aside from better colors and graphics, the game is essentially identical to Legacy of the Ancients:We've got the same top-down interface, the same keyboard commands listed to the left, the same statistics (hit points, food, gold), and the same message box at the bottom. I'm not exactly complaining; this is a game I can immediately start playing without messing around figuring out the controls. But I'm disappointed that combat in this franchise still hasn't advanced beyond hitting \"(F)ight\" until the enemy is dead.Here's Keeganac's character sheet:I note that there's no \"experience\" statistic, and that killing the Mavin got me some gold, but it didn't say anything about experience. One of the things I hated most about Legacy of the Ancients was that all the combat got you nothing but a few paltry gold pieces. Leveling occurred at fixed intervals and was tied to solving quests. It doesn't look like they've changed that in Questron II. They also haven't changed the annoying way enemies can attack you on the diagonal, but you can't.The nearby town--Folman--has a food shop and an armor shop and a few little NPC villagers who all say one line when you (S)peak next to them, although nothing terribly useful so far.Not really knowing where to go--the game manual suggests a first step is to seek the \"Hall of Visions\" so I can communicate with Mesron--I start exploring and find another town shortly to the south. When I enter, the game throws a copy protect question at me:These are all monsters in the game. If there's one thing about this series, the creators did come up with some original monster names. Questron had pit screamers, dirt weirds, and Irish stalkers. Legacy  had mime ghouls, venom floaters, and ventro flailers. This game, in addition to the ones above, has brawn warriors, snooper slinks, and jelly nymphs. Unlike the previous games, this one comes with a manual that fully describes each of them.Anyway, in the second town, Ontaga, I found that old Questron staple:They had two games: blackjack and high-low. Even better, they haven't changed the rules on blackjack since Legacy: winning pays even money, and 21 gets you double. Settling in for 20 minutes of 'jack, I turned my 203 gold into 1,290. But I noticed a curious thing: it was harder and harder to win towards the end. With those rules on payouts, I should have been able to keep going indefinitely (Legacy had you break the bank if you won too much, and then the guards chased you out of town). The dealer was getting a lot of 20s and 21s when I had 18 or 19. I wonder if the program is specifically designed to cheat if you win too much.I kept moving on and found a couple other towns. The only weapons anyone will sell me are daggers, oddly enough, and the only armor I can buy is leather. One armor shop didn't even have anything! (And I don't think it's a Demon's Winter-style thing where you have to cycle through items.) I did buy some rope & hooks for crossing mountains and a bunch of food. It turns out that tavernkeepers give hints when you tip them, and one of the tips was germane to my quest:Now if only I knew where Redstone Castle was. Also, I think it's \"soothe.\"The third town--I forgot to note the name--also had a magic shop where I can buy magic missile, one of the game's four spells. The others are fireball, sonic whine, and time sap (ironically appropriate).My reactions after playing for about 45 minutes are: this is it? The same old game--from the gambling, to the combat, to the rope 'n' hooks, to the dumb leveling system, to the useless one-line NPCs--with slightly better tiles? My nostalgic fondness for my first CRPG doesn't extend to wanting to play the exact same game, especially not in the same year that Pool of Radiance blew all of this (seriously? Only four spells?) out of the water.I decided to take a gamble. I would return to Ontaga and lay all the rest of my 1000 gold on one game of blackjack. If I won, I would keep playing to the end. If I lost, I would do my six hours as quickly as possible (yes, I know, shut up)--probably with a new character, because I'm only at 58 hit points and I can't yet figure out how to heal in this game.#$)(*&.The dealer busted spectacularly.

I knew it would be from the second or third day. The variety of encounters is rivaled only by Might & Magic, and the tactical combat system is unparalleled. I loved it.Here's the GIMLET. Incidentally, I'm drinking an actual gimlet right now--a tradition I will continue when writing \"final rating\" postings from now on.1. Game World. It's tough to evaluate this, because Pool of Radiance is part of a larger Forgotten Realms campaign setting that has more history and lore than I will ever read in my lifetime. I grant you that it is not the most exciting of D&D campaign settings. It's a sort-of generic high fantasy realm, large enough to include derivatives from almost every mythology. Dark Sun, Ravenloft, Planescape, and other settings are more interesting (if more confusing sometimes!).Even judging solely by what is presented in the game, however, the game world is evocative, thorough, and well-built. At the outset, the player knows the important history around the Moonsea and the circumstances that have led to the party's immediate quest. As the game moves forward, the player learns about the land and its lore through conversations with NPCs and entries in the Adventurer's Journal.Particularly notable is the way that the game responds to character actions. Once cleared, areas remain clear. If you kill Yarash, the land around the Barren River stops being polluted (the game even changes the look of the map). Break cover after sneaking, and the entire area is on alert for you--even after you leave and return. Once you solve quests, you can't do them again. If you make friends with the nomads, they stop attacking you in the wilderness. This sort of dynamic game world is rare in the era. Heck, it's rare even now--most games deal with this issue by constantly propelling you forward and refusing to let you re-visit older areas, where they'd have to program new reactions from NPCs. It's satisfying to reclaim the blocks of Phlan, one by one, and see signs that the entire city is improving from the effort. One quibble: I never did get the guards next to the gates to the slums to stop looking at me suspiciously.The contrast on these two screens, one from the beginning of the game and one from the end, epitomize the game's attention to an evolving game world.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I can hardly think of anything negative to say about this aspect, but I want to reserve 10s for games that offer a truly original experience and really pack it full of lore (e.g., Morrowind, Dragon Age). Score: 8.2. Character Creation and Development. The first edition AD&D rules didn't offer a lot of customization, and this game strips it down even more. You have your basic set of six attributes, and a standard selection of races and classes. The level caps on certain races are annoying and simply discourage use of those races, and the level caps on mages and clerics--which you reach well before the end of the game--are infuriating. But overall leveling is well-paced (barring setbacks from level-drainers).My biggest complaint is that the game doesn't use any of the races, sexes, classes, and alignments in a way that changes the game encounters. Perhaps the only exception is that if you have a thief, there's one section where some other thieves show you a shortcut. That's about it.To make up for the lack of character customization in the adaptation of the AD&D rules, the creators did allow some customization of appearance, which is rather rare even today. I thought the character portrait choices looked silly, but I did appreciate the ability to customize the icons. In games that give you a standard icon, like Demon's Winter, I often forget who's who. And appearance can be an important step in role-playing, allowing you to create (literally) a white knight or an assassin dressed in black. Score: 6.3. NPC Interaction. Although the game doesn't go so far as to offer \"dialog options\"--the only game to really offer that so far has been Starflight--it does offer various options at certain NPC encounters. Sometimes these are basic--\"talk\" or \"attack\"--and other times they are quite extensive--as when I had dinner with the Zhent commandant and had options to talk about politics, magic, the city, and so on. NPCs like the dutiful clerk, the traitorous Cadorna, and the pious Dirten are memorable even if you don't get to talk much with them.The ability to take on NPCs in your party is a fun addition. Might & Magic offered it, but once you hired them, they essentially became part of your party. In this game, they still have minds of their own--as the final battle with Tyranthraxus made all too clear. Score: 6.4. Encounters and Foes. Both rock. I can't think of any other game so far with so much variety in the types of encounters that you face. There's a traitor chained to the wall: do you free him, kill him, or interrogate him? Your mission is to stop the lizard man menace: do you do it by championing the old lizard man against his rival, or by just killing them all? You need to rescue a little boy from the buccaneer den: do you pick the lock and sneak out with him, free some nearby zoo animals to create a distraction, buy him from his jailers, or just kill all of the slavers? This is one of the only games to allow real role-playing options in the way you handle encounters, both quest-based and non-quest-based.At the same time, the foes are well-described in the game manual and have satisfying variations in strengths and weaknesses. It's hard to call them \"unique,\" because Dungeons & Dragons is the template on which all other games are based, but the creators did do a great job including each monster's unique characteristics. Trolls regenerate and get up if you don't finish them off quickly. Phase spiders are un-hittable every other round. Fire giants shrug off fireballs. Basilisks and medusas turn you to stone--unless you have a mirror. This, admittedly, is no different than Might & Magic. But the tactical combat grid offers you the additional advantage of seeing each foe as a distinct creature instead of \"16 skeletons.\" [Later edit: As Petrus points out below, the encounters in this game are also somewhat unique for the era in that they make sense both internally and externally: you don't find parties consisting of elves, mummies, and trolls strolling together down the Phlan waterfront.]The ability to parlay with most sentient monsters is a great inclusion, rendered even better by how different creatures react to different options. I loved watching kobolds run in terror when I yelled at them, but I was careful to be \"sly\" with ogres and \"nice\" to nomads--at least, if I wanted to avoid a fight. This game ties with Starflight as the highest-rated so far: 8.5. Magic and Combat. I honestly can't think of many games in the 30-year history of CRPGs whose combat systems I like better than the Gold Box series. It is hands-down the most tactical system I have encountered--a perfect blend of CRPG and strategy game. It only gets better in future games as the number of spells increases and give you more options. Because you can only recover spells by sleeping, and because you can't go to sleep in most places until you've cleared them, the game strikes a good balance between individual-combat difficulty (as in Might & Magic) and accumulation-of-combats difficulty (as in Wizardry). The times that I died in combat, I never thought that my failure was random; rather, I could see how a specific change in tactics would turn a battle in my favor.Duskfire's end-game spellbook.The magic system is inextricably a part of the combat system, from the buffing spells you cast before a big encounter to the offensive spells you cast during combat. Although I thought some of the spells were useless, they all work as advertised.  I've never quite understood the rationale behind the \"memorization\" system of Dungeons & Dragons spellcasting, but neither do I mind it. Yes, repeatedly resting and casting \"cure light wounds\" was annoying at times, but that's my only real complaint.The turn-based, tactical nature of the combat allows you to really role-play in combat, something you can rarely do in other games. If you decide your lead fighter hates giants, you can have him recklessly charge ranks of them without waiting for support. You can play a mage who fancies himself a melee fighter, or a scared cleric who likes to hide in the rear. You can attack in formation--lining up and moving relentlessly down a hallway--or make it a free-for-all.A line of fighters blocks the entrance to the hallway to protect the cleric.I allow, of course, that many later games improve upon combat by offering more interesting and advanced spells and character-specific abilities, liking hiding-in-shadows, setting traps, summoning monsters, shapeshifting, special attacks and defenses, and so on. Yet how many of these later games have a \"guard\" option, or let you take a swipe at a fleeing enemy's rear, or allow enemies to flee or surrender if their morale gets too low? There are hardly any other games--ancient or modern--that achieve such a perfect blend of melee combat, spells, item use, morale, and (albeit limited) special abilities. Score: 8.6. Equipment. Not bad but nothing special. There are the standard D&D selections of weapons and armor, with various pluses, and some special items like the \"flame tongue\" long sword. There are a few magic rings, potions, wands, and such. A couple of cursed items. For me, D&D won't start getting very high scores in this area until the Infinity engine games introduce detailed item descriptions, and even they don't score that high because the location of each magic item, as in this game, is entirely fixed.Karnov's inventory at game's end.I did think it was odd that my multi-classed mages could use any weapons and armor, but I don't know whether to regard that as a positive or negative. Ditto the game's odd compulsion to introduce literally every obscure pole-arm. Score: 5.7. Economy. Oh, dear. The creators did such a good job with almost everything else in this game--how hard would it have been to program a decent economic system? Some of my commenters have opined that the basic problem was that experience rewards were tied to cash rewards, so you had to get a lot of money to get a lot of experience at higher levels. I say: would that have been so hard to change? Or try this: keep the absurd cash rewards, but give me something to buy with it! Why don't any of the shops sell advanced magic weapons and armor? (Magic ammunition would have been particularly welcome.) Why aren't there more encounters where I have to pay someone off? Why don't the temples have a \"heal all\" option? (The reason I didn't use them for regular healing wasn't the cost, but rather that casting spells individually on each character took as long as memorizing them and casting them myself.)Just for fun, at the end of the game I sold every piece of jewelry and every gem I had. Since platinum pieces are worth 5 gold, I have 588,409 gold pieces. And that's without even trying--I left most treasure where it lay. To put this in perspective, I could enter Candlekeep 59 times. I could pay 30 thieves' guilds to tell me where the Cowled Wizards were keeping my sister. I could buy Rosethorn Hall in Skingrad 12 times and still have enough left over to furnish it.The game gets unbalanced economically very fast. I stopped bothering to collect money from corpses before I had even cleared the slums. I left heaps of gold and platinum sparkling in the sun, because they weigh you down.I don't even think the game gained a lot by incorporating D&D's full selection of coin types. Aside from the beginning stages, the economy is just one big fail. Score: 3.8. Quests. Quests in this game come in the form of a series of progressive \"missions\" from the City Clerk, culminating in the main quest to overthrow Tyranthraxus. The precursor quests seem like steps in the main quest but they're not, really. Other than your level, I don't think there's anything to stop you from marching on Valjevo Castle the moment you arrive in Phlan. There are even quests, like slaying Norris the Gray, that never come up as an official mission. There are a couple of quests that you don't get from the City Clerk, but I actually wish there had been more of these. Again, CRPGs won't start to get perfect scores here until they feature multiple quest endings and better roleplaying opportunities, but this game is second only to the Might & Magic series in its variety in this era. Score: 7.This was before she liked me.9. Graphics, Sound, and Inputs. This is an era in which the best we can usually say about sound is \"I didn't turn it off.\" I'm not claiming the sound in Pool of Radiance is good, but at least I didn't turn it off. There aren't many sounds, but the footsteps are inoffensive, the sound that melee weapons make when they connect is actually fairly satisfying, and fireballs actually sound a little like big balls of fire. The graphics aren't beautiful, but they're quite good for the era--especially the animated monster portraits (apparently copied from the Monster Manual of the time). Characters and monsters are easily distinguishable by icon. The outdoor terrain actually verges on pretty, although the indoor areas--despite having a lot of textures--suffers from a certain barrenness. It's evolving.As for the controls (all keyboard), I picked them up almost immediately and never had to think about them after that. This is good. Score: 6.10. Gameplay. The game is well-balanced between linearity and nonlinearity. When you first arrive in Phlan, you can pretty much only go to two places: the slums and Sokol Keep. After that, the game world opens up. Although levels and monster difficulty (not to mention the order of quests) keep you on a somewhat limited path, you do have quite a bit of freedom.I thought the difficulty was just about right. I want to say maybe a little on the \"too easy\" side, but I think my own CRPG experience might be showing here. I only had to raise dead three times (and once was because of an ill-advised duel), and I only suffered full-party death five or six times. The game was certainly perfect in length. You can tell when I'm ready for a game to be over because I stop making meticulous maps and notes, and I didn't start doing that until literally the last map area. The only thing keeping it from getting a perfect score is that it's not really \"replayable\": different character choices would still offer the same basic experience. Score: 8.The final score of 65 puts Pool of Radiance at the top of the heap, 5 points above its next-nearest competitor (the first Might & Magic). We won't be away from the Gold Box series long: Curse of the Azure Bonds comes up in less than 20 games. I remember it even less than Pool of Radiance--I'm not sure if I ever finished it as a youth--so I really look forward to it.Next up is a sequel to a game that I didn't play on this blog: Questron II."}, {"title": "Pool of Radiance: Won!", "date": "Friday, June 10, 2011", "text": "A gaze in your eyes is all the reward I require, you high-cheekboned vixen.The Moonsea is safe for democracy.The end game came surprisingly quickly after my last posting, partly because I started to wane in my commitment to drawing a full map of each level. The last two areas--Stojanow Gate and Valjevo Castle--were both laid out as a series of buildings ringed around a central hub. It was easy to ensure that I explored the entire area without having to draw anything.The moment we wandered into Stojanow Gate from Podol Plaza, some beatnik stopped us and divined that we wanted to buy his wagon even though we hadn't thought of such a thing for a second.This screen is funny if you imagine that \"sell you my wagon\" is a metaphor for prostitution.By this time, though, we had so much gold that we probably could have just paid Tyranthraxus to leave, so we were desperate to spend money on something. We bought the cart, which I gather was to serve as a disguise so we could get through Stojanow Gate. We hadn't taken five steps, though, before a bugbear patrol determined us \"imposters\" and attacked us. We'd been hearing about bugbears since we first stepped off the dock, but this was the first time we actually encountered any. They went down easily, but then an alarm sounded and our 250 GP cover was blown. We said \"screw it\" and launched a frontal assault on the gates, battering our way through while the enemy tossed rocks and arrows at us.On the other side was a reasonably tough crowd consisting of six ettins, two Level 6 mages, and two Level 4 fighters.You want to achieve CRPG bliss? Toss a fireball in the middle of a group like this. Watch some of them die and some of them just burn--and then hit them with another. Then send in your fighters to slice the throats of anyone who's still limping along with their third-degree burns.With that one battle, the gate was ours, and there was literally nothing else to find in the entire 256-square map area. We marched forward to Valjevo Castle.The Castle was actually four 16 x 16 maps mushed in several concentric squares. The castle itself was in the center (quartered among the four map areas). It was surrounded by a hedge maze, which in turn was surrounded by a ring of outbuildings. Though we ached to head right for the castle and kill Tyranthraxus, we forced ourselves to explore the outbuildings first. The encounters included:A group of laundresses who, angry that Tyranthraxus had conscripted their husbands, gave us some disguises. Like the cart, they didn't last long.A smith with three fire giants who saw through our disguise. Once they were dead, the game gave us an option to take from the smith's treasure cache, which included every non-magical weapon in the game--just in case I wanted to change my mind on the guisarme-voulge at the last minute.Wand of Lightning: For when your enemy is immune to fireballs.Lord Porphyrys Cadorna the Traitor was chained in a small room, having been beaten--I guess the enemy blamed him for the failure to kill us at the Zhent outpost. He plead for his life, but we killed him like the Clerk demanded.What happened to your hair, mustache, and beard?A room full of giant snakes! I was so delighted I almost wet myself. I'd been carrying around that damned snake charm spell for days--ProphetSword insisted it would come in handy--and damned if it didn't put them all to sleep. I need to have more faith.I'll be damned.We started encountering random patrols who, when we spoke to them abusively, asked who sent us. When we told them TYRANTHRAXUS, they just bowed their heads and let us move along. Are the coalition forces even trying this in Afghanistan? \"American! Who sent you?!\" AYMAN AL-ZAWAHIRI. \"A thousand apologies! Please pass!\"A building full of records. Different files indicated that the Wizards of Thay were allied to Tyranthraxus and that his ultimate goal is to \"conquer all lands south of the Moonsea.\" Why he's not interested in lands north of the Moonsea, given that's where Phlan is, remains a mystery.A gnoll overseer with some human slaves. One of them had overheard the password RHODIA to get through the inner castle gates.A mage in a tower who gave some notes on Tyranthraxus in exchange for his life. The notes said that Big T was \"definitely a product of immersion in the Pool of Radiance,\" which granted him special abilities. They also suggested that he somehow brought the pool with him from the mountains to Phlan.A group of giants (the castle area had a lot of hill giants and fire giants) arguing about whether frogs and toads were the same thing. We tried to explain the difference, but I'm afraid we just ended up killing them.The giants are giving ridiculous amounts of gold. Look at all this treasure we're leaving behind after each battle:I could buy 61.1 carts.As I said, the castle itself was surrounded by a hedge maze. Navigating it was rendered a little easier by some maps we had found in the Koval Mansion, but it wasn't very big and probably would have been easy anyway. When we walked through the door of the inner keep, we encountered someone calling himself \"Tyranithraxus, ruler of Phlan\" (that's not a misspelling; he had a \"i\" in it). If that wasn't enough to suggest he was a fake, the fact that he had only two fighters with him and he went down in two hits would have been.At this point, we returned to Phlan to get our last level-ups and to identify some of the equipment we'd found. Somewhere, we picked up a long sword +5 and a long sword +2 flame tongue, but I confess I don't know what battles got us which. The Clerk didn't have anything to say about the death of \"Tyraninthraxus\" so we returned to the castle.Uh...don't medusas slither?Some stairs up behind a secret door took us to a medusa. Fortunately, my characters had the initiative and killed her before she could gaze. Finding some other stairs behind a secret door, we went up a level, through a door, and found a wizard who was all-too-ready to betray his master and join the party. For some reason, we let him.The rest you can watch on the video below.If you don't feel like watching, I spend quite a bit of time casting every buffing spell I can think of, scouring my scrolls for more, and drinking my potions. At 02:50, we finally march down to Tyranthraxus's chambers in which, apparently, is the fabled Pool of Radiance. The demon's personal guards--10 powerful Level 8 fighters--attack, and thank god for \"Hold Person,\" or we would have ended up a lot worse.After battle, we spend some time healing, and then exit to face Tyranthraxus himself. He is, like the rumors say, a bronze dragon (the thief captain had noted that this was unlikely, since metallic dragons are usually good). Tyranthraxus gives each character the option to join him, and of course they all said \"no.\" (Later, after I had won, I reloaded to see what would happen if we all voted \"yes,\" but it just brings up the standard \"party death\" screen: \"The monsters rejoice for the party has been destroyed\"; I had been hoping for a cool alternate ending.)Battle begins at 10:00, and Tyranthraxus is the only opponent. Koren charges him and--what the hell? Why is my swordsman hireling attacking Koren from behind?! The bastard chose to join Tyranthraxus! I've never felt so betrayed. He's been with us since the troll battle in the slums. I personally paid for him to rise from Level 3 to Level 8. I outfitted him with the best equipment I could find--well, no, granted most of it was cast-offs from my PCs, but it was still a lot better than the non-magical long sword that he started with. Do I have to mistrust everyone whose disposition is \"evil\"?!My strategy for Tyranthraxus is to surround him and pummel him, which works out well, except that he kills Octavianus with his lightning breath (11:09); incidentally, who has ever seen lightning bounce off walls in real life? Duskfire strikes the killing blow (11:26), but then the stupid mage I picked up nearly kills Duskfire and Koren with his wand of lightning. At first, I figure he's with Tyranthraxus, too, but then I realize no, he was just aiming it at the swordsman and not bothering to notice that my two PCs are in the bolt's path. I get them out of the way and Lame Brain has the pleasure of chopping the traitorous dog's head off (11:47).Tyranthraxus the demon escapes the dead dragon's body and gives a villain speech. I imagined I was in for yet another battle, but I guess Bane doesn't abide failures. Big T gets sucked into his own pool and it's all over. The game kindly auto-transports us to Phlan, where I raise Octavianus and for some reason I waste time leveling my fighters before going and getting the clerk's congratulations.I had some fun paging through the Adventurer's Journal and looking at the entries that I didn't find. Most of them were deliberate misdirection aimed at players who cheated and read ahead. There was both a fake proclamation and tavern tale having to do with a woman kidnapped by ogres to the east of Phlan; they don't exist. There are three or four fake X-marks-the-spot maps that start at real reference points. One can picture puzzled players wandering around the area trying to find the hidden treasure that isn't there. There was a journal entry suggesting that Mace the cleric betrays Tyranthraxus, which never happens.One fake journal entry, supposedly written by one of Tyranthraxus's servants, says that the evil lord is really Maram of the Great Spear, and he's just using Tyranthraxus's name. I've seen this \"theory\" pop up on some web sites, including the Forgotten Realms wiki, but I think these are based on people reading this false entry and not knowing that it's false. At least, I assume it's false--I never got this journal entry.These maps lead to nothing.There was a fake letter indicating \"happy, prosperous people\" in a castle in a swamp--this is really the lizardmen's castle. Another insists that the Pool of Radiance is in the Dragonspine mountains. There's a couple of paragraphs that would lead the careless reader to assume the nomads are evil, and attack them. The Adventurer's Journal's writers were good at trolling.A few thoughts before I start getting my GIMLET together:1. I  could swear that the end fight in this game is different than when I  first played it on the Commodore 64. I remember Tyranthraxus fighting with his minions.2. Given that the game's name is Pool of Radiance,  the pool itself plays a minor role. I'm not really even sure what it  is. The various journal entries suggest that it was in the mountains,  but Tyranthraxus somehow brought it into his chambers in Phlan, and it's  not so much a pool of liquid as one of magical energy, and whatnot.  Anyway, aside from seeing it from a distance when I enter Tyranthraxus's  chambers, I don't get to do anything with it. It's certainly not the  focus of the game.3. So what happens if you return to the castle  after the end game and check out Tyranthraxus's chambers, maybe get a  look at the pool up close? Tyranthraxus re-appears and gives his villain  speech again! Very disappointing, Pool of Radiance. I guess the developers figured no one would want to do this, so they didn't need to make a permanent change to the game map.4.  I'm still a little confused about how Tyranthraxus became a dragon. I  guess he was just possessing a dragon's body (which is how he got around  the whole metallic=good thing), but I feel like I missed some  explanation somewhere.I thought the ending was a tad anticlimactic, but overall a great game, and I look forward to doing the final review."}, {"title": "Pool of Radiance: Cleaning Up for the Show", "date": "Thursday, June 9, 2011", "text": "That's quite a revelation! Or at least it would have been if we'd ever heard of \"Tirantikus.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When last we met, I had three quests: stop the lizardmen from joining Tyranthraxus, rescue the \"heir to House Bivant,\" and deliver Lord Cadorna's message to the Zhentil outpost.The lizardman quest, which I did first, was the easiest. I had freed some poor lizardmen from the clutches of Yarash, and they had given me a password (\"SAVIOR\") to use with others of their kind. When I returned to the ruined castle that lizardmen call home, I was greeted by the old lizardman chief, who was having trouble with a young upstart.I agreed to fight the challenger, who was pitiful and went down in a single string from my two-handed sword +2. I got what I wanted:This is where I wonder what would have happened had I refused. I suspect I would have ended up fighting the entire castle of lizardmen and ensuring that they didn't follow Tyranthraxus via genocide.At last, I can finally buy a sextant!I had no idea where to find the \"heir to House Bivant,\" so I decided to head off to the Zhentil Keep outpost to the west, but on the way I ran into a \"buccaneer base.\" Inside, my blood boiled to find slave pens full of men, women, and children.As I was exploring, a shady character who looked exactly like Norris the Gray sold me a pass so I could get in and see the captain of the base. I asked the captain about the boy--who I assumed to be the missing heir--and he offered to sell him.The slavery had already tried the patience of my mostly-good party, but the captain's use of \"alot\" sent it over the edge. I attacked him. He was a tough character, with 110 hit points, but he went down eventually. They all do.Killing the captain put the base on alert, and in a nearby barracks, I was confronted by five waves of dozens of soldiers each. I fought five battles that basically looked like this:There's another entire screen of these guys off to the right.But most of them were low-level buccaneers, and it was fun to wade through them, using \"sweep\" to cut down swaths of them in a single attack. In the end, I had the base to myself, and I was able to free the slaves.After a little time resting and healing, I continued west to the Zhentarim outpost. You run into Zhentarim or \"Zhents\" in numerous Forgotten Realms games, but I had never been quite sure what they were. Thanks to the Forgotten Realms wiki, I now know that they're an evil mercenary company headquartered in Zhentil Keep, and more than once they've plotted to take over kingdoms.They greeted me as \"diplomatic envoys\" and I had dinner with the commandant after delivering to him my letter from Cadorna. During the meal, he tried to pry me for information about Phlan, and one of his aides told a story about Dirg, a barbarian hero who did battle with a demon of fire who could possess bodies and lived in a magic pool. Dirg was able to trap the demon on a \"triangle of power.\" This sounds like Tyranthraxus, but I otherwise don't know what to make of the story.After dinner, I went to bed. To absolutely no one's surprise, a bunch of Zhents burst into my room and tried to kill me. They failed, and the entire keep went on alert. I kept encountering random patrols, so eventually I just set up in a narrow corridor and let them come to me. After six or seven battles with random fighters, the commandant attacked me personally.He was pretty tough, and he had a high-level mage with him, but to my astonishment, \"Hold Person\" worked on both of them. I still had both my fireball spells, too, so I made quick work of this battle.Returning to Phlan, I was rewarded for the three quests and I got a startlingly frank and cold directive from the Clerk:I love it when she talks like that.The Clerk had no new quests for me, but she asked me to meet with the head of the Council, Lord Urslingen, who gave me what amounts to the final quest: storm Stojanow Gate and take the castle!Two quick items of note:1. My swordsman hireling--whom I've brought all the way from Level 3 to Level 7--is starting to annoy me. I spent 25,000 gold pieces on a \"fine long bow\" for him, and he refuses to use it. Since you can't trade FROM NPCs, I had to have him drop it and equip him with a long bow +1. Then, in the last battle, when his hit points fell to 8, he actually surrendered! What kind of loyalty is that? After the battle, he just waltzes into my party again like nothing's happened--he even had the gall to take his share of the loot!2. The only proclamation outside City Hall is the one that was there when the game started: reclaim the old sections of Phlan.My two mages just hit their max levels and get a second fireball spell. Karnov got some gauntlets of ogre power and a long sword +4 at the Zhent outpost. I've got more magic items than I know what to do with, including two wands of magic missiles, a wand of lightning, a wand of paralyzation (yes, that's what the game calls it), a potion of giant strength, a javelin of lightning, and two potions of speed. I think I'm ready!"}, {"title": "Turn-Based vs. Real-Time Combat", "date": "Wednesday, June 8, 2011", "text": "Which is better? If you automatically choose left, you're probably on the wrong blog.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Although I'm only blogging about one, I am currently in the midst of two CRPGs: Pool of Radiance on my PC, and Dragon Age: Origins on my Xbox 360. The latter was my wife's suggestion, after she had read some reviews online. We've been playing for a couple of hours maybe three times a week. Mostly, I play the game and she tells me what dialogue options she wants me to choose.I confess I am a bit of a sucker for games with good conversations, and Bioware games (Baldur's Gate II, Planescape: Torment, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic) do it best. [Later edit: mea culpa. PS:T wasn't a Bioware game. I should have said, \"the series of interrelated games by Bioware, Black Isle, Interplay, and Obsidian, starting with Baldur's Gate.\" Even then, I probably am somehow technically wrong, so if someone can come up with a better term, please offer it.] If the characters are well-drawn, it's fun to learn their back stories, and dialogue options give a lot of room for roleplaying. Dragon Age is very dialogue-heavy, but the responses are interesting and the voice acting is top-notch.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I prefer Aeryn Sun, but Irene wants me to romance this chick.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nonetheless, between Pool of Radiance and Dragon Age: Origins, I can honestly say I'm enjoying the games about the same, and I enjoy Pool of Radiance a lot more when it comes to combat.Dragon Age's real-time combat system gives a lot more combat options, of course. You've got missile weapons, melee weapons, and spells. You've got traps, and poisons, and acid bombs. Each of your four characters has a plethora of special attacks and defenses that you choose as you level up. (Some are passive and happen naturally; some you have to choose.) The animation is beautiful and the sound realistic. You can line up different \"tactics\" for specific scenarios (e.g., when an enemy gets in melee range, switch to a melee weapon; when a party member falls to 50% of his health, heal him) so you don't have to micromanage each character in combat.But here's the difference between the two: in Dragon Age, most of the time,  I have no idea what the #&*$ is going on. Seriously. Combat begins. My party members go into their tactics. I select one of the foes for my lead character to fight. I start using his special attacks. Meanwhile, there's a cacophony of sound as friends and foes meet each other and cast spells. Colors streak across the screen. My character starts sparkling for reasons I don't understand--am I being affected by an offensive spell, or did one of my party members cast a buffing spell? Sten starts calling for healing but then suddenly he's at full health even though I didn't heal him. Liliana starts saying \"trap, trap, trap\" even though we're in combat and it's unrealistic to disarm traps. My character is suddenly paralyzed and I don't know why. The screen shakes and I go sprawling against a tree--what hit me? Then, all at once, it's over, and apparently we're all alive.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, it looks cool. I just don't know what's happening. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oh, look, honey, it's 10:00 p.m.! You toddle off to bed while I head over to my computer and enjoy the relative tranquility of turn-based tactical combat.Turn-based combat is dead. I know it. I can't even remember the last game that featured it. Pool of Radiance: The Ruins of Myth Drannor, probably, which was boring beyond belief, but not because of the combat. I actually really liked that part. Anyway, here, in these older games, I can still enjoy it.These are what I see as the relative advantages of turn-based combat.1. I know exactly what each character and enemy is doing. When a foe casts a spell, I can see what the spell is, and I know how to counter it. I never wonder why I suddenly got paralyzed, or knocked down, or killed.2. You notice details. In turn based games, when a PC gets an extra attack, you actually notice it, and it makes the battle measurably easier because of it. I can pay close attention to how much damage various weapons are doing. The effects of special attacks are very apparent. Check out my fighter performing a \"sweep\" in the video below. Notice how satisfying it is to see all the enemies fall, one by one. In a real-time game, you'd blink and miss it.3. In turn-based games, you can fight armies. I don't think the Xbox processor would handle all the AI necessary to plot a battle against four dozen kobolds, five trolls, two fighters, and a wild boar. 4. Turn-based games are more tactical. When each character's turn comes up, I can pick the best strategy based on the  totality of the battlefield, not the one foe that happens to be in front  of me.Now, I've given plenty of high praise to real-time games. The Infinity engine games (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale) were real-time. But they also had a couple of features that games like Dragon Age lack. First, you could set the game to pause when certain things occurred, like a character dying or an enemy casting a spell. This allowed you to check things out, re-evaluate, and issue a new set of orders. Second, the relatively large scale of the map let you see most of your enemies at once. In Dragon Age, the scope of what you can view is very limited, and it's almost impossible to get a sense of the entire battlefield. [Later edit: I just watched a video of the PC version of the game, and there are more camera options there, and you're not quite as close to the action, so perhaps my argument is more valid for the platform than the game.]The battles I fought yesterday in the kobold caves produced some of the most satisfying, exciting, edge-of-my seat moments that I've ever experienced in a CRPG. I wish I'd saved my big \"combat\" posting for this battle. It was pitched at just the right amount of difficulty, and it came when my characters were at the sweet spot of character development--that point when you've raised enough levels to have a fair number of attack and spell options, but before you have so many that you get paralyzed with indecision and just rely on the same old standbys over and over. It came at a point when I had cool spells like \"fireball,\" but not so many that I could just waste them.Part of the source of the difficulty is that there are actually three battles back-to-back with no time to rest and heal (or save) in between. Then, shortly after, just when you think you're out of the woods, there's a fourth one of equal difficulty. During my first exploration, I blundered into them unprepared with low health, and I got killed in the second battle. Because I have a limited save policy, I had to start the caverns over again, but I knew enough to record it the second time.The setup of the battle is that I'm exploring a series of caves that form a kobold kingdom, with the intent of stopping the kobolds from joining Tyranthraxus's minions. The video starts when I encounter a fighter named Fatima--a runway from a nearby barbarian tribe--who was a prisoner of the kobolds but had just escaped when I ran into her. She joins my party before the big fight.Here are the highlights from the battle:01:14: I know I'm about to go into battle, so I cast my available buffing spells.01:50: Tyranthraxus's emissaries convince the kobolds to attack. Note that I'm facing dozens of kobolds, a handful of kobold leaders (they have bows), and four trolls.01:58: First fireball (each mage can only memorize one). I accidentally cast it a little too far to the left, but look how awesome it is, clearing out that huge swath of kobolds and damaging the trolls.02:52: See how Karnov's \"sweep\" clears out an entire front rank? Doesn't get much more satisfying than that. Octavianus has his own at 03:21.04:03: I probably didn't need to use my second fireball here, but I was worried about killing all the trolls before the first ones started to regenerate and get back up.04:34: Zink is a little sick of those two yipping bastards sniping us from the left, so he darts around the troll, behind their backs, and clears them out.04:58: Karnov's backstab works perfectly on a troll!05:06: They're surrendering, but Lame Brain isn't about to let them all get away.After the first battle, there's nothing worth taking. Before I can do anything, the king fires some kind of missile weapon at us, causing pretty serious damage, and the second wave of kobolds attacks, this time pushing wild boars. The boars, note, have an annoying trait of getting back up after you've killed them.06:40: What do we do with a front rank all lined up like that? Time for a wand of lightning bolt! (I should have started it with the boar instead of the kobold.)07:17: The smug little dogs think I'm out of fireballs. Little do they know: I have fireball scrolls! Just look at that destruction.09:20: A second lightning bolt (it turns out there were only three in the wand) finishes off two of the remaining three boars.10:08: Lame Brain sucks up a backstab from a kobold so he can get into position to take out more of them with his sweep.10:44: The AI has Fatima running around uselessly in a corner, which is probably good since she only has 4 hit points.10:53: I fully intend to hit \"YES\" here and continue the battle so I can heal everyone before the third one starts. Lame Brain and Fatima are dangerously low. But I'm so used to hitting \"NO\" on this screen that I do it out of force of habit and lose my chance to heal before the third battle.Tyranthraxus's emissaries are now thoroughly disgusted with the kobolds and join the third battle themselves. There are more trolls, kobolds, and boars.11:30: Fatima goes down with a magic missile. I don't bandage her until 12:38.11:43: By now, I'm fairly terrified of losing. I don't want to waste what I think is my last fireball scroll, but I don't see any other option.12:11: \"Hold Person\" surprisingly works on one of the fighter/mages.12:24: Sometimes I love my NPC swordsman.13:05: Okay, I take it back. I don't always know everything in turn-based combat. I have no idea what that spell just did.13:31: When this battle began, did you imagine that it was Zink who would go down? Lame Brain has been darting around trolls and boars with single-digit hit points for the entire battle. With 2 hit points left, he takes down the last troll at 13:51.The battle is over. My party is bruised, and Zink is unconscious, but otherwise I came out pretty well. I use my \"cure light wounds\" spells to get everyone on their feet.I want you to notice at this point that I don't save it. That's right: even after all that, I'm sticking to my one-save-per-map rule--a rule I have never regretted more than at 15:03. That pause you see just after the battle starts is me swearing and yelling at the walls. I'm sure I'm going to die here and have to do it all over again.15:44: Thank Tyr. I have one fireball left. Most of the kobolds die in flames.16:25: I hate to waste Lame Brain's turn, but he's almost dead. I quaff a potion of extra healing.16:34: Lot of good that did.17:03: The third and last lighting bolt is put to use. I feel like maybe I wasted it.17:58: Koren, who usually sucks at this, triumphantly takes down a boar with a thrown hammer, and then because I forget to re-arm her, at 18:30 she takes down one of the last kobolds with her bare hands.I made it through another one. I have no more healing spells. I have to use a potion just to revive Lame Brain. And I still haven't killed the kobold king! For all I know, he's hiding around the corner with another army. And I still don't save. Saving is for the weak.19:56: I am sure I'm about to face another battle. I march grimly to my doom.19:59: Ha! I'd normally consider this a \"let down,\" but in the condition my party is in, I'll take it as a gift from the gods.20:17: Interesting encounter. I guess I could have used him in the graveyard, but frankly the vampire wasn't all that hard.20:33: I come across the kobold king's mostly-useless treasure horde. There's no way I'm trying to lug all that copper back to Phlan, let alone 50 chains of bones, 6 fungus-covered tapestries, and so on.21:15: The pause is me consulting my map for the quickest way out of here.21:57: Fatima takes off just as she was beginning to grow on me.I emerge to the fresh open air and promptly save the game before resting and healing.I say this without hyperbole: that is the greatest 20 minutes of CRPG playing that I have experienced since starting this blog, rendered all the more satisfying because I resisted save-scumming. You can argue about my tactics--I don't know why I didn't try \"stinking cloud,\" for instance--but you can't argue with the results. And I don't think I will ever have a battle that sweet in Dragon Age.I'm guessing one more posting to mop up the rest of the quests, and then one as I storm Valjevo Castle. I'm not looking forward to the ending of this one."}, {"title": "Pool of Radiance: The Great Outdoors", "date": "Tuesday, June 7, 2011", "text": "Tip: Your Level 6 party will not slay a silver dragon.The game world in Pool of Radiance is much larger than I remembered. I had forgotten about the outdoor area entirely until I took a boat from Phlan to the north part of the city to deal with the graveyard and Temple of Bane. Apparently, I could have left the city at any point after clearing Sokol Keep.Moving around the outdoor map is done from an isometric viewpoint--the  only time in the game, other than combat, that you see your party  top-down. They somehow acquire horses the moment you step outside. The  boundaries are somewhat arbitrary, but the coordinates go from 2,2 in the northwest to 41,29 in the southeast, suggesting a total map area of 1,053 squares (although some of these are blocked by water).And I was determined to explore every one.When I left town, I knew of three things I needed to find and do in the outdoor map: stop the kobolds from joining the enemy, find the source of the river's pollution, and stop the nomads from joining the enemy. But I wasn't sure where to find any of these things except a vague idea that I should probably investigate the large pyramid upriver. Still, paranoid that I'd miss some vital encounter on the north side of the Moonsea, I went as far east as the map would allow me, and started methodically traveling north and south, looking for anything interesting.What I found were random encounters. Lots of them. And with enemies that I haven't encountered anywhere in the game so far: driders, wyverns, phase spiders, stirges, tigers, centaurs, nomads, displacer beasts, thri-keens. Many of them poison, which absolutely sucks in this game, because you have to hustle back to town and neutralize the party member to revive him. I generally find that the same strategies that work in town (e.g., being abusive to kobolds) just instigate fights here. Of course, you can't parlay with non-sentient creatures. I find that \"flee\" hardly ever works.Fighting wyverns around stumps and logs.Outdoor combat differs a little from indoor combat. First, you tend to start far away from your enemy. This is great if your enemies are melee fighters and need to come to you, but bad if they're spellcasters and missile fighters, and you need to trek to them. It can take two rounds just to get next to your foe. Second, there are a lot more terrain features in the outdoor map--logs, stumps, felled trees, shrubs, rivers--and you can use these to your advantage to protect certain party members or funnel your enemy to a particular position.Fireball comes in handy outdoors as well as indoors.In the exploration pattern I followed, the first fixed encounter that I came across was a ruined castle surrounded by a drawbridge. Immediately upon entering, I was greeted with an \"anti-magic shell,\" and I was grateful I had multi-classed my spellcasters as fighters. Inside, I found a host of lizardmen and giant lizards, and something tickled my memory saying that I wanted to do something else before I explored here, so I kept going.\u00a0 \u00a0 High in the mountains, I entered the cave of a silver dragon, and I chose the option to \"challenge the evil leader of Old Phlan.\" The dragon responded with the screen at the top of this posting, at which point I apologized. The dragon accepted my apology and gave me this:Bollocks. I knew I did the cemetery out of order. Continuing on, I came to a \"small, dark cave\" that turned out to be occupied by two wyverns and a little bit of treasure. Near that was a camp of nomads.\u00a0 \u00a0 They turned out to be friendly chaps who threw me a party before asking my help defeating marauding bands of kobolds. The three battles that followed were embarrassingly easy, and at the end, the nomads promised not to join Tyranthraxus.I agreed, and he said he was leading me to the treasure chamber, but he actually led me to the location of a wyvern, which he expected to kill me. Unfortunately for him, I had already dispatched the wyvern. He lasted only moments longer.I tracked down the kobolds themselves to a cave to the southeast. There, I fought a series of epic battles that left the kobold king and two of Tyranthraxus's envoys dead. I videoed all 25 minutes of it, but I'm going to make you wait for that until tomorrow, when I post again about turn-based tactical combat.It's worth noting that by this point, I've stopped bothering to pick up coins. I only take jewels and gems, and even those I'll probably never cash in. I'm far too overloaded with wealth.I could have returned to Phlan at this point and gotten a nice reward, but I figured I'd clear up the third of my outstanding quests, and I headed upriver from Phlan to the location of an odd pyramid--the likely source of the Barren River's pollution. The nomad king had referred to it as a \"Pyramid of Evil.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The pyramid was one of the most difficult levels so far in the game, partly because of the tough encounters with high-level fighters, lizard men, driders, displacer beasts, and other creatures, and partly because it was composed of a series of teleporters that made mapping difficult (there were also no coordinates and no area maps). This message was frequent:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The secret was that each teleporter had two potential destinations, and I just had to map everything methodically.Destroying the river's pollution.I had to translate some dwarven runes (this game really gets a lot of mileage out of the codewheel) to get the password to the inner keep: NOKNOK. There, I found the mad sorcerer Yarash, who has apparently been experimenting on lizardmen in an attempt to create a sahuagin.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He wasn't hard to kill, and a search of his papers afterwards showed that Tyranthraxus had tried to force Yarash to join his forces, but Yarash refused and swore to \"send an army of unstoppable aquatic creations down the Barren River and sink your precious castle\" if Tyrantraxus bothered him again. Other notes indicated Yarash was aware of the silver dragon to the northwest and the kobolds to the east.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In another room, I freed some lizardmen who, in gratitude, gave me a password should I encounter other lizardmen. It translated as SAVIOR. I'll head back to their castle later and try it out.As I left the pyramid, the effects of my environmental crusade were immediate:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 What was kind of neat, too, was that back in Phlan, a message on a square next to the river which had previously said, \"You walk near the polluted Barren River\" now says, \"You walk near the beautiful Stojanow River.\" I guess fixing the pollution problem not only cleaned up the river, but changed its name!I got my three rewards from the clerk and was, of course, given three new quests:Lizardmen are preparing to join the enemy. I need to stop this. That one should be easy.The \"heir to the house of Bivant\" needs to be rescued. She doesn't say from whom. I'm not really sure where to find him.The third quest came from my old friend Lord Cadorna, who wants me to deliver a message to a Zhentil Keep outpost to the west.Lord Cadorna assumes I've never read Hamlet.As I close up for the day, Octavianus is a Level 7 fighter--he only gets one more. Karnov is Level 6 in both fighter and thief, so he has a little ways to go in both (thieves max at 9). Zink has hit his level cap as a cleric (5) and is a Level 6 fighter. Lame Brain and Duskfire are both Level 6 fighters and Level 5 mages--they get one more mage level. Koren, as I said last time, is maxed as a Level 6 cleric. My best weapon is a bastard sword +3, and my best armor is leather +4. I've got quite a large selection of wands and scrolls.Again, big kobold battle coming tomorrow. I think I'm getting fairly close to the end."}, {"title": "Pool of Radiance: Holy and Unholy", "date": "Monday, June 6, 2011", "text": "And a very stereotypical cape.The first time I played Dungeons & Dragons as a pen-and-paper game, I remember spending a long time rolling dice, naming, and coming up with a background for a thief character. I seem to recall he was a halfling, although I can't think for the life of me what made me want to play a halfling. Probably my companions told me they made better thieves. I had a handful of starting gold, and I equipped the character. I remember being confused about why he'd want a 10-foot pole (especially when he was only about three feet high), but my companions assured me I needed one.After maybe an hour of character creation, we began exploring the dungeon. While my memory is probably off that I died in the first room--it may have been the second or third--I do remember what killed me: a ghoul. I was exploring a cabinet and a ghoul came out, paralyzed me, and ate me while my comrades were searching another corner or something (I remember the DM whispering to me that they didn't know what was happening just yet). That added insult to injury: I got eaten by a ghoul, and no one noticed.I don't think I had even heard the word \"ghoul\" up to that point, and I certainly didn't know they could paralyze on touch, which seemed horribly unfair to me. Even now, when I encounter a ghoul in a CRPG, I have this ingrained sense of dread and I concentrate all my attacks on it until it's dead. Nothing worse than getting paralyzed and eaten.Valhingen Graveyard featured eight types of undead: skeletons (including a giant one), zombies (including a \"juju\" variety), ghouls, wights, spectres, wraiths, mummies, and a vampire. Probably no list better exemplifies the amalgamation of mythology in modern high fantasy. Skeletons are pan-cultural, but zombies (as we think of them) are west African in origin, as is the term \"juju.\" (The Forgotten Realms wiki says that a juju zombie retains its consciousness and knows that it's dead and is thus \"horribly vicious and cruel.\") Ghouls are Arabian. The term \"wight\" was used in Middle English synonymously with \"man\" and only became attached to the undead, I think, in Lord of the Rings. \"Spectre\" has long been used as a synonym for \"ghost\"; the word itself is French in origin. Wraiths come from Scotland, mummies from Egypt, and vampires from eastern Europe.In the game, all but skeletons and zombies are hateful, hateful things. I don't know how much the creators of D&D relied on folklore in crafting the effects of the undead, but that list of eight creatures can inflict your characters with just about every harmful effect except poison, including paralysis (ghouls), disease (mummies), fear (mummies), level drain (wights, wraiths, spectres, vampires), and charm (vampires). I suffered all of them in my quest to clear out Valhingen Graveyard.The cemetery was appropriately gothic. Valhingen Graveyard took me several hours and featured some jaw-dropping experience point rewards.  My first major battle, with a spectre (fortunately, I killed him before  he could drain anyone) was enough to get 1,900 experience points. (Part  of it must have had to do with the large amount of treasure I found on  him.) I think my top XP reward up to this point was around 400. Just as I  was basking in that, I defeated a giant skeleton nearby (38 XP) and  opened a marble chest he was guarding, receiving 4,367 XP!This was enough to send Koren, my pure cleric, to Level 6--the top level  she can achieve. Think about that for a minute. I haven't even begun to  explore the outdoor areas yet. I can't be even halfway through the  game. Yet one of my characters is already maxed out. If I had any pure  mages, they'd be in the same boat.There were some nice illustrations in the graveyard. This one was animated with flashes of lightning in the background.I thus decided to use Koren to help with the graveyard and then dual her  to a fighter. Dual-classes, for those uninitiated, are available only to  humans in the first and second edition of D&D rules. Once they switch, they lose the abilities of their first classes  until they achieve one higher level in their second classes. I'd dual her  to a mage except mages also max at Level 6, so I can't get her to Level 7  in this game. Fighters can go up to Level 8. With luck, I thought, by the end of  the game and the big battle with Tyranthraxus, she'll receive her cleric  abilities back again. If not, I always have Zink, and I can get a  cleric NPC. More on this at the end.The good news was that at Level 6, Koren has the ability not only to just turn, but also to destroy skeletons and zombies. Very satisfying.The turn didn't work so consistently on wights and spectres, who swiftly became my most hated nemeses because of their level drain abilities. The infuriating thing about level drain is that although it can be  undone with a \"Restore\" spell, the spell only restores as many  experience points are necessary to achieve the minimum of the level. If  your Level 6 fighter has 58,000 XP, about halfway to Level 7, and he  gets level drained and restored, he'll have 35,001 XP. This means that a  good time to fight level-draining undead is immediately after you've  gained a level, or if you've already maxed your levels. Thus, Koren made  an ideal melee fighter against wights here. I orchestrated it so that  she and the NPC swordsman took most of the damage. Unfortunately, they  didn't take all the damage.  Lame Brain got knocked down to the bottom of Level 4 magery when he was on  the cusp of obtaining Level 5, and Octavius lost about 3000 XP (he had recently achieved Level 6 as a fighter). The one saving grace is that the game equips you with a metric ton of scrolls of restoration.Evil, evil bastards.Unfortunately, wights appear as random encounters in the graveyard, so I had to flee a lot.  Fleeing generally takes you back to the entrance. From there, I'd  retrace my steps only to encounter wights again and have to flee. It was  slow mapping.The graveyard had a lot of fixed encounters with spectres creating skeletons, zombies, and wights. Killing them knocked down the number of random undead and was key to clearing the entire area. I faced three mummies in a stand-alone crypt with no treasure. Oddly, I finally got Karnov's backstabbing skill to work, although it shouldn't have worked on undead. Not that it worked all that well.There were a couple of caches of arms and armor that had once belonged to paladins, one guarded by a wraith, but the other simply handed to me by a kindly spirit. In one or the other, I found a sword +2 that, although not explicitly cursed, severely wounded any character I tried to have equip it. Finally, I figured out it could only be carried by someone who was lawful good. Fortunately, I had one lawful good fighter/mage, Duskfire, and she's got it.  I think it would have been funnier if the choices at the bottom had been \"leave\" and \"suffer.\"The big bad in the cemetery was a vampire. I found his coffin before I found him, and in it was an account of previous adventurers who had slain a vampire. It noted that the first time, he didn't \"die\" but rather retreated to his coffin, where they had to kill him again. This clued me in that I needed to do the same. Octavianus lost levels again fighting the creature, but none of his \"charm\" spells worked and neither battle with him was overly hard. I'd rather face him eight times than any more wights.So I got back to Phlan and decided I'd better dual class Koren before I  get all my experience rewards from the Clerk. I went to the training  facility and...ha ha, joke's on me. Pool of Radiance  didn't implement dual classes. I don't know what gave me the idea that it did. I guess Koren will just have to go through the rest of the  game having already reached her potential.The experience rewards were considerable, and they enabled both Lame Brain and Duskfire to get Level 3 spells. You know what that means: fireball!Mage spells tomorrow, though. Now that both of my clerics have Level 3 spells, let's take a look at them. The creators carefully imported all the pen-and-paper spells for each level whether they made sense or not. The first issue is that the game has no source of healing that doesn't involve paying absurd amounts to the temples. Resting only heals one hit point per 24 hours--a very literal adaptation of the D&D rules. The only healing spell in the game is \"Cure Light Wounds,\" which means that you have to assign this spell to almost all your clerics' Level 1 slots. Healing after  a tough battle, or tough series of battles, is a long process of memorizing the spells, resting, casting, and memorizing again.With most of the Level 1 slots needed for healing, it's tough to imagine ever using some of the other spells. \"Curse\" lowers the THACO and morale of enemies by 1, but it only lasts six rounds and is hardly noticeable. \"Detect Magic\" puts a little * next to magic items in your inventory, but usually you know when something is magic; you just don't know what it does (for which you need to have it identified at a shop). \"Protection from Evil\" only affects the caster, which doesn't make it worth the slot. \"Protection from Good\"...does anyone deliberately fight good characters in this game? \"Resist Cold\" would be helpful if I ever met a monster that did cold damage.There are some other mysterious ones in Level 2 and 3. I've never gotten \"Find Traps\" to work, and I haven't found any snakes on who to cast \"Snake Charm.\" \"Animate Dead\" turns one of your dead PCs into a zombie NPC--wouldn't it be better to raise him? I haven't needed \"Cure Blindness,\" and the effects of \"Cause Blindness\" don't seem to be enough to waste a Level 3 slot. \"Cure Disease\" is helpful when you have it, but \"Cause Disease\" takes more time to do any damage than you'll ever spend in combat. \"Bestow Curse\" has \"variable effects determined by the computer.\" Uh-huh. Finally, anyone who goes around equipping items without identifying them first deserves what he gets, but otherwise \"Remove Curse\" works here.Essentially, I go through the game using five cleric spells out of 24: \"Cure Light Wounds,\" \"Bless,\" \"Hold Person,\" \"Prayer,\" and \"Dispel Magic.\" If anyone has honestly found the other spells valuable in Pool, please tell me how.The Graveyard was my last city area, aside from the castle itself, to take care of. Tomorrow, I head into the wide open wilderness to solve the quests involving kobolds, nomads, and the source of the river's pollution."}, {"title": "Pool of Radiance: Clearing the City", "date": "Sunday, June 5, 2011", "text": "The world at last! A find in Mendor's Library allowed me to look at a general map of the city and game world.A few days ago, it took me one and a half postings to cover a single map area (the slums), and now I'm going to cover seven in one. I'm afraid my playing has been outpacing my blogging. These are the seven map areas that I've explored and cleared, based on their names on the map above.Kuto's WellThe main part of Kuto's Well offered combats with hobgoblins, orcs, goblins, and kobolds, no different from the Slums. There were only a couple of fixed encounters. In the southern part of the map, I found a door guarded by some lizardmen with giant lizards. Defeating them allowed me to bust open the door and release a mysterious female prisoner, who warned me that \"an evil spirit from an unholy pool\" is behind my enemies (clearly Tyranthraxus and the Pool of Radiance). After she fled, I found a nice cache of arms and armor beneath a rug.She follows this with: \"An evil spirit from an unholy pool guides your enemies. It hides behind a fair countenance. Be not deceived.\" Wouldn't it be cool if Tyranthraxus was disguised as the City Clerk? I know that's not the case, but I think the creators missed a great twist ending.There was a eponymous well in the area, though, and descending it led me to the secret caverns of the bandit Norris the Grey. This was a another maddening area to map, because most of the 16 x 16 grid wasn't used, and I was sure I was missing secret doors somewhere. The one secret door that I did find led to an area with nothing in it.\u00a0 Norris had a letter on his body (recorded in my journal) in which someone called \"The Boss\" demanded he assemble his men and follow a hobgoblin on an unspecified mission in exchange for \"food, treasure, and many slaves.\" Norris had drafted a reply in which he told the Boss that: \"I will never follow the orders of a hobgoblin. I don't go on missions until I know exactly what we're supposed to do. And I don't go on missions for an unknown amount of 'food, treasure, and slaves.'\" I like this Norris fellow; I'm sorry I killed him.And what the hell was he, anyway?In general, this journal entry does a good job illustrating how the game fleshes out its NPCs, even if you can't interact with the NPC or use this information to any real degree.Podol PlazaThese role-playing choices aren't outstanding for the modern era, but no other game of this age offers such a variety.Podol Plaza is where I was sent to find out what high-level item \"the enemy\" was selling at an auction. The area was crawling with monsters, and when I entered, the game gave me a nice roleplaying choice about whether I wanted to \"stride boldly forward,\" disguise my party as monsters, or sneak around. I chose the disguse, and it held through much of the area.\u00a0 The auctioneer was in the middle of the area, and there were a couple of ways to play the encounter, including trying to listen to rumors in the crowd, bid on the object, push your way forward to get closer, and so on. The auction ended with one of the bidders (called \"Garwin\" by the auctioneer) creating a distraction, snatching the item (some kind of wand), and running off. I don't know if there was any way to play it so that I would have gotten the object, or fought the auctioneer, or whatever, but the Clerk did reward me for the limited intelligence I returned with.They were full of lies.On the eastern side of the same area was a building that had been converted to a temple to the god Bane, who is tied in some of the literature I found with Tyranthraxus. I pretended that I wanted to join, but the orcs in charge saw through it and I fought a protracted battle. On the west side of the Plaza was a monster bar called the Pitt. The moment I walked through the door, a mercenary challenged me to one-on-one combat, which I won, but then the whole place erupted into a brawl. Oddly, I had a pack of hobgoblins fighting on my side, which is another nice combat feature that I forgot to mention yesterday. It occasionally happens that NPC squads join you in battle. Since your characters are in the front ranks, they often end up dithering around ineffectively in the back, but it's still a first, I think, for a CRPG.The hobgoblins behind me are actually behind me!Textile HouseThe Textile Complex was the most maddening of the areas in the game so far, featuring enemies that caused poison (frogs, lizards) and level drains (wights). The presence of huge packs of undead in the area is never really explained. The lower half of the map featured a sort-of hobgoblin town, complete with kitchens, dining rooms, and a nursery. A lot of these rooms had basic descriptions when I walked in (e.g., \"a dilapidated former mansion; the tapestries on the walls are rotted and tattered\") that gave a nice pen-and-paper-style RPG feel. Such depictions are scattered throughout Pool of Radiance, but they seem more densely concentrated in this area.Well, now I feel like a dick.I kept finding slaughtered hobgoblins with blood graffiti on the walls indicating that \"Skullcrusher was here.\" Skullcrusher happened to be in the literal last square I searched on the map, imprisoned in chains. Apparently, he was a servant of Councilmember Cadorna, sent to the complex to retrieve the same heirloom box that was the object of my quest. I guess I could have taken him as an NPC if I'd had a slot free, but I didn't, so he happily went back to his master.Mendor's LibraryI originally attempted Mendor's Library after Kuto's Well, but no picking or bashing in the world would get me through the locked main door, so I had to wait until one of my mages had the \"Knock\" spell before I could return.A basilisk was unexpected at Level 3.In the library, I found four rooms containing stacks of books. One of them was guarded by a basilisk, which seems like a slightly unfair fight for my level, except fortunately I was able to overwhelm him and kill him before he could gaze (that must be what the mirrors in one of the shops are for). \"Searching\" the rooms seemed to have a random chance of producing a useful book. A couple times, I was about ready to give up when I suddenly found another book. This uncertainty led me to search each room about 100 times before I was sure I'd found everything.This game and I have a philosophical disagreement about what is \"useful.\"There were five useful journal entries here. One was the map that starts this blog entry. Others gave me insight into the Pool of Radiance and Tyranthraxus. Apparently, the Pool of Radiance is one of many such pools throughout the realms. By immersing oneself in the pool and performing a certain ritual, one can gain great powers, including immortality. The book notes that the pool is not necessarily tied to a single physical location.Presumably, Tyranthraxus the Flamed One did use, or is using, the Pool to achieve his powers. One of the books listed him as a \"lesser power\" among the god Bane's \"hall of Minor Courtiers.\" Others in his group are given as Maram of the Great Spear, Haask, Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud, and Camnod the Unseen. I looked these folks up the Forgotten Realms Wiki, and I can't claim to understand all the history that goes along with their stories, but the upshot is they all seem to be quasi-deities defeated by the \"Dead Three\"--Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul--in their quest for godhood. It's neat to see a tie-in with Bhaal at this point in the D&D CRPG oeuvre.Another book suggested that Tyranthraxus was once a powerful mortal general who waged a scorched earth campaign across kingdoms called Barze, Horreb, and Vane. He was wreathed in some kind of magical flame, which eventually destroyed his body, setting his spirit free to possess other mortals. Someone named Baron Schodt was able to imprison him in a vial of water and toss it into the depths of a lake. Presumably, after that, he got free and somehow ran into Bane and . . . hell if I know. He's back, anyway, and probably the \"Boss\" that everyone's going on about.I like games that feature this kind of in-game lore. Morrowind probably does it best: through various books, notes, and recollections of characters, you try to piece together what really happened to Nerevar all those years ago, and you never really get a final \"answer.\"Mendor's spectre attacked me on the way out. He was capable of draining two levels in one hit, but fortunately he went for an NPC first.Someone needs to introduce Mendor to rubber stamps and overdue fees.Kovel MansionI was directed to the Kovel Mansion area by the Clerk, saying it had been infested with thieves and she wanted me to rout them. The mansion was full of traps, locked chests, locked doors, and so on, and I seem to remember from my last playthrough (admitted, a long time ago) that it was the only part of the game in which a thief was really needed. Well, boy did my thief fall down on the job. I guess by multi-classing him, I ensured that he wasn't a high enough level to do any of the necessary tasks. We tripped every trap, and every lock required bashing it or using a \"Knock\" spell (I think I encountered a game bug here, because I was able to use \"Knock\" multiple times even though I had only memorized it once).There was quite a lot of treasure to find, though, including some relatively high-level magic items (leather armor +4 is the highest plus I've received so far). Lone thieves kept attacking me, and I'm not sure of the purpose of that. There was only one big battle, with a group of thieves, some high level, but it wasn't too tough.These thieves seriously need to put some shirts on.The neat thing is that the bandit leader seems to have been collecting intelligence on Phlan, Tyranthraxus, and the surrounding area. There were several notes full of bulleted items meticulously organized as \"facts,\" \"strong rumors,\" \"rumors,\" and \"vague rumors.\" A whole set concerned Councilmember Porphyrys Cadorna, who lately sent me on a quest for a family heirloom. He is a \"rising star\" in council politics, rumored to be charming but vindictive, and apparently he contacted the thieves to get information about the Pool of Radiance, and is hiring mercenaries. Something tugs at my memory here, but I can't quite place it.Another set of facts and rumors concerned Ulrich Eberhard, the leader of the expedition to retake Phlan. I haven't run into him yet. There's a vague rumor that he's actually bought by \"The Boss.\" There were several maps whose labels indicated they were part of a maze in Valjevo Castle, which I'll have to storm eventually. One of the thief's notes indicated it was a \"fact\" that \"The Boss\" holds audiences in Valjevo Castle. He is apparently trying to recruit tribes of monsters in the surrounding area to re-take Phlan, and he is rumored to be a \"dragon or a human who can take the form of a dragon,\" perhaps even a metallic dragon (which would be abnormal because they are usually \"good\").Wealthy AreaThis map, lying in between Kovel Mansion and the Temple of Bane, essentially served no purpose. There were endless random battles with orcs, goblins, hobgoblins, and ogres here. In all other maps, after I've fought enough battles, I've \"cleared\" the area and they've stopped. But I never cleared this one.Those sigils become important.There wasn't much to find: some orc living quarters, a cryptic message on a wall (see below), and a single journal entry that listed some numbers of creatures (\"Ogres--1, Hobgoblins--40,\" etc.), but I don't know where. I've certainly killed more than those numbers here. The primary purpose of the area seems to be to ensure that you meet groups of orcs carrying leather holy symbols of Bane, so you can use them in the Temple of Bane area. If this wasn't clear, letting some goblin slaves go free gets you a warning to the effect that \"to enter the Temple, you need a holy symbol of Bane.\"Letting them go got me a hint, albeit a useless one.Although the random encounters never stopped, I did find that my higher-level party was much more intimidating. Parlaying with the creatures in an \"abusive\" tone generally caused them to flee or to give me an anemic warning about \"nonbelievers\" needing to \"hit the road, ya bums.\"Satisfying.Temple of BaneI had picked up Dirten a long time ago after the Clerk told me to go see Bishop Braccio at the Temple of Tyr. Dirten had a mission to clear out the profane temple and restore it to its rightful god.Keeping hidden treasures is what we call a \"given.\"The Temple of Bane had an interesting geography. The 16 x 16 map was dominated by the large temple, surrounded by a series of outbuildings. It had more random encounters than even the Wealthy District, and even though I tried to parlay my way out of most of them, I kept getting surprised by unbelievable hordes of goblins.\u00a0 At the entrance, the orcs, seeing my holy symbols, stood aside to let me in. I looted the temple of a couple of treasure caches before facing a major choice:\u00a0 My Level 4 characters, undoubtedly egged on by the NPC Dirten, decided they had no fear of inciting the wrath of a god.  I destroyed the temple and was attacked by a horde of orc fighters and bowmen led by an orc cleric named \"Mace.\"\u00a0 It was a long battle, but it's been a long time since orcs were a serious challenge. Between \"Sleep\" and \"Hold Person,\" I took care of a bunch of them--including Mace--in the first round. The rest of it was just mop-up, and I have to hand it to the orcs: they held on, not one surrendering, until the last one fell. On the leader's body was a set of orders from Tyranthraxus telling him to investigate the source of the undead menace in Valhingen Graveyard, so apparently Big T isn't behind it.Dirten left me at this point to take care of re-sanctifying the temple, and I returned to Phlan for my \"reward\"--nudge, nudge--from the Clerk.I'm a sucker for pouty lips and high cheekbones.Having completed these areas, Octavianus is a Level 5 fighter, Karnov is a Level 4 fighter and a Level 5 thief, Zink and Duskfire are at Level 4 in both fighter and mage classes, Lame Brain is Level 4 in both fighter and cleric, and Koren is a Level 5 cleric. My swordsman NPC is also a Level 5 fighter. He's risen twice, and I've had to front him the gold both times.I'm getting to it!My outstanding quests from the Clerk are:A number of interrelated quests having to do with Valhingen Graveyard. I'm dreading this. I'm sure it'll be full of level-drainers. The Clerk gave a Two Handed Sword +1, +3 vs. Undead to help me out, along with a bunch of restore scrolls.Find a tribe of kobolds and stop them from joining with the enemy.Find a tribe of nomads and stop them from joining with the enemy.Figure out the source of the pollution of the Barren River, which runs alongside Phlan.You might note that some of these quests seem to require me to leave Phlan proper. I haven't mentioned this yet--mostly because I forgot this from my previous times playing the game--but Pool of Radiance boasts an extensive outdoor map!Not all of the game's exploration is first-person.More on that next time, but for now, see if you can help me solve some outstanding mysteries. No outright spoilers please, but I'd appreciate some hints (use ROT-13 if you're unsure).1. In Mendor's Library, I came across three caches of gold foil. They don't seem to do anything (although they are equippable), and they sell for 0 gold. What are they for?Mendor's Library left me with two mysterious items.2. Also in Mendor's Library, I found a Manual of Bodily Health, which in other D&D games raises constitution. When I equip and read it, nothing happens. Just a programming mistake, or am I missing something?3. Scrawled on a wall in the Wealthy District was this message: \"NORTH WALL. RI__T FRONT GLAS_.  __SE.\" There's nothing on the north wall of this district, and I can't think of anything it would apply to. Any ideas?4. One of the items I found in the Temple of Bane was a ring of feather falling. Does this help anywhere in this game?"}, {"title": "Pool of Radiance: Combat", "date": "Saturday, June 4, 2011", "text": "Have I ever mentioned how much I hate level draining?The combat system developed for Pool of Radiance--and consequently used in all of the Gold Box games--is one of its greatest features. I've been waiting for a properly epic battle in which I can describe all of these features in detail, but since the troll fight, none of the combats have been particularly difficult. I'll do the best I can with what I have.The system is the culmination of many years of experience at SSI. They first introduced ultra-tactical combat in Wizard's Crown. I blogged about it almost a year ago. If you look at the screen shot from that game, you find that it's strikingly similar to the shots you've seen in Pool of Radiance:This was before I knew how to use the DOSBox screen capture command. God, I was so young.At the time, I noted that \"there are no less than 20 actions that each of your characters can perform\" and that the sheer number of statistics would \"give a migraine to Sun Tzu.\" Apparently, I wasn't the only one to feel this way, because they greatly simplified the combat system for Shard of Spring and Demon's Winter--where you had the same sort of screen, but only the abilities to move, attack, cast, and use an item.Pool of Radiance errs more towards Wizard's Crown tactical complexity, while removing many of its annoyances. Chief among them is having to be concerned about which way the character is facing. In Wizard's Crown, you had to be facing your enemy's specific position to attack him, and turning was an annoying process that took a weird key combination. In Pool of Radiance, the facing direction does matter, but the game just automatically adjusts it when you choose to target a particular enemy.The second thing I like about the Gold Box games is the use of movement points. In previous SSI games, the character's movement points (dependent on speed and encumbrance) dictated both how far he could traverse the battlefield and the number of attacks. In adapting this for POR, SSI realized they had to follow D&D rules about number of attacks, so movement only determines how far you can go in charging your enemies or fleeing them. Once you actually stand face-to-face with a foe, even if you exhaust all your movement to get there, you get all the attacks your character class and level warrant. This perhaps makes a little less logical sense, but I confess I like it better.A high strength and dexterity, and a low encumbrance, gives Duskfire a lot of movement.Combat tactics start before the battle. If you are lucky enough to \"surprise\" the enemy, then you get a free round of attacks before they can react. If neither party is surprised, you have the option to flee or parlay, which I talked about a few postings ago. If you know you're going to fight, the more important pre-combat consideration is the distance from the enemy when the combat begins. Consider the screen shot below:The enemy is about 30 feet from me. If I choose to enter combat at this point, we will face each other across an expanse of empty room. This can be a good thing if the enemy consists primarily of melee fighters (as ghouls are) I can line up my characters and either \"guard\" or try to pick them off with arrows and spells before they get in combat range. If the enemy consists of fighters with bows and spells of their own, I probably want to close the distance (with the \"advance\" command) before entering combat. This level was infested with poisonous lizards and frogs--many of which necessitated a hasty trip to a temple--so any time I could start combat at a distance was a good time.Once you enter combat, there is a certain terrain based on the surrounding walls (which are based on the map area you're in when you enter combat). You can't quite use the environment to funnel your enemies the way you can in Ultima IV, but you can try to use it to your advantage. If you face multiple spellcasters, for instance, you might try to get all your characters out a door and around a corner so they can't see you and have to come to you one-by-one. This is very hard, though, and it's very frustrating when you have half your characters around the corner and two of them get hit by \"Hold Person\" spells while they're out there on their own. If I'm facing a lot of melee enemies, I prefer a narrow corridor. I can draw clear battle lines, face only four enemies at once, and protect my spellcasters.Narrow corridors make it easier to line up and wait for your opponents, perhaps while \"guarding.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The order in which the PCs and enemies attack is based on \"initiative.\" I guess this is based partly on the character's dexterity score, but there must be some randomness to it because it's not the same order every time (unlike in, say, Might & Magic). Going first is usually best, but there are times in which you want a character to move later; for instance, you might want the cleric to hang back in case someone gets injured during the round, or a fighter might be blocked by someone else who should move first. The game allows you to \"delay\" the movement of any character to the end of the round, and I find I use this a lot.If you want to wait for the enemies to come to you, you have the option to guard. Guarding means that as soon as the enemy gets within melee range, you get a free swipe at him, with an attack bonus. I use it a lot when facing melee fighters from a distance--it has a better chance of connecting, and does more damage, than missile weapons.Once combat is joined, the first consideration is who to target. Spellcasters are naturally a priority. Under this game's rules, spellcasters cannot cast if they take damage before or during the casting. So if there's an enemy mage and you can hit him with an arrow, you don't need to worry about him until the next round. There are also enemies that drain levels, poison, and paralyze, and I often target them even ahead of spellcasters. I particularly hate level-drainers. I met a lot of wights in the Textile Complex, and they got me a few times. You can restore drained levels with the \"restore\" spell (on scrolls or at temples), but it doesn't restore all the experience points that you had gained towards the next level.The way this game implements poison is particularly galling. In later D&D rules, poison causes attribute drains or continual health loss, which is bad enough, but in this game, a poisoned character \"dies\" instantly. You have to drag him back to a temple for healing, or you have to take a chance with the second-level \"slow poison\" spell, which brings the character back to life for a few hours, but if you can't get to a temple fast enough, the character dies for real. In my opinion, \"slow poison\" isn't worth it.Anyway, back to melee combat. Barring spellcasters and enemies that drain levels, paralyze, or poison, I vacillate on whether it's best to target the toughest or weakest enemies first. To the best of my ability, I concentrate my attacks on a single enemy until he's down, since a wounded enemy hits as hard as a hale one. Better to face three gnolls at full health and three dead than six at half-health. I generally slaughter the low-level enemies first, but I'm not sure it's the best way.As in all D&D games of the era, whether you connect with an enemy depends on your THAC0 (\"to hit armor class 0\") score, which in turn depends on dexterity, strength, the weapon wielded, and the way the enemy is facing. This is a bit of a neat implementation of the rules. The first character to attack an enemy attacks head-on (if the enemy was facing away when the attack starts, he turns to face the attacker). All subsequent characters strike at the enemy's side or rear, with consequent THAC0 bonuses. If a thief attacks from the rear, he has a chance of backstabbing the opponent, but I've yet to get this to work in this game.As fighters advance in levels, they get a couple of useful abilities. One is naturally a lower THAC0 (like armor class, lower is better). Another is the ability to make multiple attacks per round. A third is the ability to sweep low-level enemies. This third skill is so much fun it makes it worth it to attack parties of kobolds. With \"sweep,\" the fighter can attack every adjacent enemy in the same round. Nothing like wading into a mass of goblins and clearing out seven of them with a single attack.I only got two this time, but if Zink goes next, he has the opportunity to get four!Spells add a whole new dimension to combat, and fortunately you learn them slowly, because at these levels you don't have that many spells. \"Sleep,\" which saved my tail numerous times in the slums, is starting to lose its potency against higher-level foes. \"Hold Person\" works okay, but only for humanoid creatures. I don't have any cleric spells past Level 2 yet, nor any mage spells past Level 1, so I'll cover spellcasting in a later posting. Mostly, I find, you have to get a feel for what works and what doesn't. \"Charm Person\" seems like an awesome spell--it instantly converts an enemy to your team--but I find that it fails so often I hate to waste a round casting it.You can flee combat by moving to the edge of the map and making a getaway. If you're facing a melee enemy when you try to flee, you can say sayonara, because they get a couple of free sweeps at your exposed backside, and I find that they almost always connect. I hardly ever flee, but enemies often do, and I find it's a good tactic to get as many characters as possible within melee range before they turn tail. This is especially true with undead. I try not to turn undead until the end of the round, when all of my fighters are next to them and will have a chance to hack at them as they flee. Sometimes enemies feel so overpowered that they just surrender. Whether enemies flee or surrender, you don't get experience points for them, and I'm not sure you get their items, either, so I prefer to just kill them.That sweep took all the fight out of him.Now, if a character's hit points go to 0, he doesn't die immediately. Instead, he gets knocked unconscious and loses one point per round until he reaches -10, at which point he dies. I guess he can die immediately if he gets walloped by someone and immediately goes to -10, but I haven't faced enemies that tough yet. Stopping the bleeding requires taking a round to bandage the fallen comrade.The aftermath of a battle with ghouls.Finally, if you're sick of fighting manually against low-level enemies, the game offers a quick combat option for each character in which the computer controls him. The AI is fairly simplistic: characters use missile weapons until they run out of ammunition or until an enemy comes into melee range, and then they use melee weapons. Even this isn't consistent, though, because my dwarf fighter never uses his crossbow in quick combat. Sometimes a spellcaster under computer control casts, but I can't figure out the specific rules on this. Computer-controlled characters never guard, use items, or backstab, and the enemies that they target seem completely random. You only want to use it when facing low-level melee creatures. I did use it a bit in the Podol Plaza area, which featured battle after battle with orcs and hobgoblins. I let my characters swing away while I wrote my blog.He doesn't quite look 10 feet tall, does he?Again, I don't have a great model battle, but below you can see one between me, a bunch of hobgoblins, and an ogre. This was the boss battle in the Textile Complex area, and I needed to win to recover councilmenber Cadorna's family heirloom. At some point prior to the battle, I picked up another NPC, a cleric named \"Dirten\" who wants my help clearing out the Temple of Bane.Knowing I'm about to fight a battle, I cast \"Bless\" and \"Prayer\" (Dirten has Level 3 cleric spells), which give combat bonuses. Battle begins at 00:57, and note how the 3D corridor--door to the right, narrow corridor ahead opening up to big room--is reflected in the walls on the combat screen.I forgot I had the characters in quick mode, so Zink immediately goes charging at the lines of hobgoblins. This is fine, though. There a lot of hobgoblin leaders, which means they have bows. I couldn't have hung back and let them come to me. I stop quick mode before Zink reaches them, and I use him to cast \"Hold Person\" on three of the front-rank hobgoblins. This means that not only will they stay put for a few rounds, but their fellows behind them won't be able to move either.Lame Brain heads down at 01:45 and casts \"Sleep\" on a batch of the little buggers. Now take a look at Karnov, who only has 3 movement points as he begins his round. I have him loaded up with found equipment, and he can barely stumble a few steps towards the battle. I have him take out a hobgoblin with his crossbow, just to damage the enemy's morale.Koren comes down and holds another trio, and Duskfire puts another group into the land of Nod. Computer-controlled Dirten also casts \"Hold.\" By the time the round is over, over half the enemy is held or sleeping. (Notice in later rounds, like at 04:18, the computer has him try to cast \"Hold\" again, before checking whether he can see any un-held enemies.) After that, it's a total mop-up operation. Normally, I'd take out the ogre last, but I'm a little worried he'll surrender, so I get him early in the combat. At 07:55, I get my reward, and have the option to open Cadorna's secret heirloom, or take the box to him intact. I opt for the latter.I hope this wasn't too much detail. I really love this level of strategy in combat, and it's especially exciting when you adopt a \"limited save rule\" like I do. I'll lose a lot of gameplaying time if I die, so I carefully plot most battles. I love it when a single character saves the day--and then somehow has to get his party back to safety. You can even do some role-playing in combat. When I was a kid, I'd pretend that my lead character was shouting orders to the others (\"Lame Brain, cast 'Fireball' on that rank! Quickly!\"). Then, maybe a character would go down, and my mage, enraged, would charge a rank of enemies with his quarterstaff as his companions shouted \"No!\" and looked on in horror. Now that I'm an adult...well, of course I don't do that any more.I have to catch you up on a lot of plot-related stuff, as I've cleared four more maps since yesterday. This is the kind of game that I like to play so much, it annoys me to have to take time out for blogging."}, {"title": "Pool of Radiance: Heroes!", "date": "Friday, June 3, 2011", "text": "The first in-game mention of the Pool of Radiance and the big bad.As we prepared to return to the ruins  the next morning, Karnov took me aside and asked what I thought about  supplementing our party of six with a hireling.\"You mean a mercenary?\" I said.\"Call  it what you will,\" he said. \"There's a whole bunch of them--wizards,  clerics, fighters--over at the guild, just waiting for a party to take  them along. Imagine what we could do with a few more healing spells, or  another sword in the front ranks.\"\"And another share of the treasure,\" I pointed out.\"Which we have plenty of!\" he retorted. \"If I suggest it to Octavianus, will you back me up?\"I  reluctantly agreed, but fortunately it didn't take a lot of persuasion  on our part. Octavianus was cautious but open-minded. \"Let's check them  out.\"We returned to the arena and met with the Arena Master, who  could have been Octavianus's cousin. At first, he tried to interest one  of us in a one-on-one duel, but we declined. After that, he was willing  to talk about the mercenaries.Mercenaries turned out to be  relatively expensive. A competent swordsman wanted a share of the  treasure equivalent to three of us, and a decent cleric wanted four  shares! Some of the potential hirelings wanted their pick of any magic  items we found, which Octavianus called a \"dealbreaker.\" Ultimately, we  decided to hire a fighter to sit in the rear ranks with a bow. The  swordsman made no secret that he was only with us for the money, and he  declined even to tell us his name!And he's evil!Party NPCs have been available since The Bard's Tale, where you could summon monsters but not control what they did in combat. Ultima IV, of course, had NPCs that would join you, but once they did they were under your full control. Might & Magic II was the first game in which the hirelings demanded payment, but you could still control them. Pool of Radiance is the first game that has hirelings that a) take a share of the treasure, and b) perform their own actions in combat.The city council thinks of Old Phlan as an orc-infested ruin that needs to be reclaimed. Orcs just think of it as their home.Hell, no, that's not acceptable. Has anyone ever chosen a hireling who gets to take the magic loot?At first, I thought to hire a mage so I wouldn't have to dump one of my multi-classed mages for a \"pure\" one, but I realized that without the ability to control when and where offensive spells were cast, the usefulness of the NPC was in question (I might still try it later). A cleric would be a good idea because you can control hirelings outside of combat, when most of the cleric's spells are needed, but I already have two of those. So, for now, I just went with a fighter.Returning to the ruins, we  cleared out a houseful of orcs before finding another strange encounter:  an old fortune-teller living in a small hut in the middle of  monster-infested ruins. We paid her small asking price. In a trance, she  informed us: \"Blood and violence are writ boldly in your future. Look  for friends where you expect enemies and enemies where you expect  allies.\" We agreed that it was worthless but also harmless.Just as an aside, you can choose to attack the old woman, in which case this is what you get:I reloaded, of course, although I was mildly curious to see if anything developed out of the gods noting my actions.After a few more hours, it seemed we had explored every inch of the slums except the southwest corner, where we had heard ominous noises inside a section of the Old Rope Guild. I suggested to Karnov, our thief, that he might \"sneak\" into that area to see what kinds of monsters awaited us, but he gave me a strange look and responded cryptically that he wouldn't be able to use his ability to hide in shadows for \"a few more years at least.\"When we rounded the corner, we found a group of trolls and ogres tossing a sack of grain around. Startled, they dropped the sack and then looked greedily to our heads as substitutes. The battle was joined. After a long fight in which both Duskfire and Lame Brain nearly died, we were victorious!I recorded this battle below. I'm still not going to go into a lot about tactical combat just yet, but the recording should give you a sense of how it works.If you know you're about to fight, the first thing you want to do is cast any buffing spells (making sure to turn off \"search\" first, since having searching on causes 10 minutes to pass every time you take a step), so at 00:30, I cast my one buffing spell: \"Bless.\" We wander in to combat, which starts at 00:53. Note how the narrowness of the corridor prevents my three rear characters from attacking in melee. It starts with one of them, Koren, whose turn I decide to delay in case someone needs healing at the end of the round.Duskfire attempts a \"sleep\" spell--sometimes you get lucky--and it does put one ogre to sleep. I immediately have Octavianus slay him (01:04), because the more monsters you kill, the greater chance that the remainder will suddenly decide to flee. Lame Brain, as usual, goes down almost instantly (01:07), and I have to waste Zink's turn bandaging him so he won't die.The rest of the combat shows me slowly picking away at the trolls and ogre, and even watching it now, I'm not sure how I survived. I got some lucky hits. I lose Duskfire at 03:40, which means neither she nor Lame Brain will get experience from this combat (more below). Trolls regenerate and pop back up if you don't finish the battle quickly, so I was in danger of losing until the last moment. Note how the NPC fighter insisted on using his ranged weapon, effectively blocking my two rear PCs from fighting until late in the combat (Koren somewhat ineffectually flings hammers at the trolls). You can see the somewhat annoying process of switching from melee to ranged weapons here.The tide turns at 4:47, when the remaining trolls decide to flee for the hills. This is good news for a couple reasons. First, fleeing enemies expose their backs to automatic attack, and you can see Zink take down one at 04:53 without any extra effort on my part. Then, because the corridor is blocked, I can calmly finish off the second one with missile weapons.The potion I loot at 05:40 turns out to be a potion of speed. I kept the video going for a while, showing the process of healing the downed characters (05:50), memorizing spells again (06:13), walking back through the slums and returning to town (07:40), walking about town, checking into an inn to rest (08:33), and returning to City Hall for my reward (09:06) and a new quest (09:25).After which she proceeded to unlace...the strings on a fat purse of gold.Of three outstanding quests--clear Sokol Keep, find books and tomes relating to Phlan, and figure out what's being auctioned a Podol Plaza--I decided to go to Sokol Keep next, mostly because I know where it is. (Podol Plaza might be the map adjacent to the old city, but I'm not sure. Maddeningly, there is a map of all the areas in the Adventurer's Journal, but I'm forcing myself not to look at it until I get that entry.) I took a boat from the Phlan docks to the island fortress, a former Temple of Tyr that had been overrun by monsters about 50 years prior.In the courtyard outside the main keep, shortly after stepping off the boat, I found the remains of a dead adventurer and a note:I remember encountering this screen the first time I played Pool of Radiance, back when I was 14. I had played Questron, Ultima IV, Might & Magic, The Bard's Tale, and perhaps a few others, so I wasn't a CRPG infant, but thinking of this screen always gave me a bit of a tingle for years. When I thought of CRPGs, and how much fun I had playing them, I thought of this skeleton outside Sokol Keep. With more experience under my belt, I think I understand why: this is one of the few times in a CRPG (up to this point) in which you encounter something that 1) does not involve combat; 2) gives a sense of what it's like to play real RPGs; 3) tells you something about the game world; and 4) makes thematic sense. It offers a tantalizing sense of history and lore to the game that you don't get from just reading the manual. It would be overstating the case, probably, to suggest that the transition from the Silver Age to the Golden Age of CRPGs hinges on a skeleton in a courtyard...but it at least does for me.I just want to say that I think that's a nice picture of a skeleton.Anyway, the note turned out to have three words, which I had to translate from Elvish laboriously with the codewheel: \"Lux,\" \"Samosud,\" and \"Shestni.\" The keep inside was crawling with undead, but after a few battles, I realized I could parlay with them and use the word \"Shestni\" to make them back off. \"Lux\" turned out to pacify a few fixed encounters with undead, and \"Samosud\" got me out of the keep after the last encounter. Fighting undead is a pain right now because my clerics aren't high enough that \"turn undead\" destroys them--it just causes them to flee. Likely as not, they encounter an obstacle in their flight and I have to go chasing after them to end the battle.In one of the rooms, I found some ghosts who, pacified with \"Lux,\" gave me some gems and a leather-bound journal that told me of the fall of Sokol keep. This was the first time I had to look up something other than a \"tavern tale\" or a City Hall proclamation in the Adventurer's Journal. I'll reproduce it below to give you a sense of the quality of the writing and how the journal integrates into the gameplay:An old leather-bound book, written with a small, firm hand.\"The hordes came again last night. Their coordination was frightening. Under the cover of darkness, goblins and kobolds pushed bundles of sticks to within bow range. These bundles formed a wall that protected the small ones from our archers. Once the wall was erected orc archers took up safe positions there and begin pelting the castle walls with arrows.\"We tried shooting flaming arrows at the wall of sticks to set it afire. Monsters are normally afraid of fire. But these monsters showed no fear. They simply scooped dirt on the flames to put them out. Before all the fires were out they had resumed firing at us. Surely, some unnatural force must have been at work to weld these quarrelsome beasts into an organized fighting force.\"I do not know if we can combat the monsters onslaught much longer. We lost 12 more men last night. The monsters seem to have an unlimited number of reinforcements. The Last Priest of Tyr, Ferran Martinez, says he has a way to protect the keep, but he says that it's so terrible that it may only be used as a last resort. Unless we receive reinforcements shortly, Ferran Martinez is our only hope.\"  Any chance that means that they're trying to join my fraternity?Inside the main keep was a large battle with orcs and hobgoblins that I won only through perseverance and effective use of \"sleep\" spells. Half my characters were unconscious at the end of it. On the hobgoblin leader's body was a piece of parchment with his orders (delivered in another journal entry). The orders refer to a \"party of invaders\" (us!) against whom he was to assemble \"a force of no less than three squads\" (not enough!) and to \"kill them before they can return to the city council with information about the true situation at the keep\" (they failed!). It is signed \"The Boss,\" which is the first clue (aside from what the orcs say during parlay) that there's an organization behind all these monsters.This battle took almost 30 minutes.Finally, the Sokol Keep temple, I met the spirit of Brother Martinez, who credits a \"magical pool\" (clearly the Pool of Radiance) with the force behind the successful monster invasion of Phlan. He also names three \"chiefs\" of the monsters: Torath, Edranka, and Tyranthraxus. I can't pretend not to remember that Tyranthraxus is the \"big bad\" of this game, but I don't remember if we learn anything more about Torath and Edranka.Again, note the role-playing options here.I returned to the City Council for more rewards for clearing the keep. Ironically, the proclamation announcing the quest to clear the keep was posted outside (the proclamations and the City Clerk's quests don't seem to be in sync). I was told to visit a city councilor for another quest. The councilor, Poryphyrys Cadorna, asked me to recover a family heirloom from the Textile Complex, which I assume is another area to the west of the old city.Is it just me, or does he look like Commander Riker?At the end of this entry, as you may have noticed in the screenshots (check the hit points above),  I'm facing a serious experience imbalance. Characters who are  unconscious or dead at the end of a battle (the latter hasn't happened  yet) do not gain experience, which means they do not gain levels, which  means that they're all the more likely to go unconscious in the next  battle. Lame Brain and Duskfire, who aside from always getting conked on  the head are splitting their experience between two classes, only finally hit Level 2 when I got back from Sokol Keep, while Octavianus and Koren--my two \"pure\"  characters--are on Level 4. Clerics only get six levels, so I have to  remember to dual Octavianus after he hits level 5 (more on that later).A few final stray thoughts:The game has a fair number of unused squares. There was an entire section in the northwest corner of Sokol Keep (below) that drove me crazy. I figured there must be something back there, but no amount of beating at the walls would let me through. Unlike Might & Magic and The Bard's Tale, there is no teleport or etherealize spell in D&D, so these squares will remain forever unexplored.I think of this every time I play a game based on AD&D's first or second editions (which includes everything from here all the way through Baldur's Gate II): second-level cleric spells suck. Every other spellcasting level for both mages and clerics has spells that you use throughout the game, no matter how powerful you get. The first-level cleric spells \"Bless\" and \"Cure Light Wounds\" never stop being relevant. Mages have the workhorse \"Magic Missile\" at Level 1, and some useful spells like \"Stinking Cloud\" and \"Acid Arrow\" at Level 2. What do clerics get at Level 2? In this game, it's \"Find Traps\" (useless here), \"Hold Person\" (hardly ever works, and only on humanoids), \"Resist Fire\" (useful only in certain situations), \"Silence\" (usually fails, doesn't last), \"Slow Poison\" (useless), \"Snake Charm\" (I'll let you know if I see any snakes), and \"Spiritual Hammer\" (which does the same damage as a normal hammer, which I have).When you think about it, second-level cleric spells are everything a married man needs.The one disappointing thing about the game, as you see in the video above, is the graphical spareness of the game. Corridors and rooms are completely featureless unless you trigger a special encounter. You have to envision tables, chairs, beds, wall hangings, and other physical features.As graphics improve in CRPGs, they show, rather than tell, these things. Oh, there was a battle with giant frogs at one point. I never found a good place to bring it up.So I still have three open quests: find books and journals about Old  Phlan (Martinez told me that Mendor had collected these things in his library), figure out what's being auctioned at Podol  Plaza, and recover the heirloom from the Textile Complex. I don't know  precisely where any of these are, so I'm going to head west out of the  slums and see what I encounter first."}, {"title": "Pool of Radiance: First Expedition", "date": "Thursday, June 2, 2011", "text": "Because of your level when you stumble into it, I think this is one of the toughest encounters in any CRPG. I died. Almost instantly.We stepped cautiously past the suspicious guards, through the archway, and into the old city, kicking our way past debris and rats. Some kind of alarm blared in the distance. The hallway ended after about 30 feet with a closed wooden door on the left. Opening it, we entered a large chamber, likely the ruins of a barracks or inn.I have no idea what the alarm is about.We had taken no more than a few steps when an orc patrol entered from a doorway to the south. Filthy, snarling creatures, they spotted us immediately and began muttering excitedly to each other. Most party members prepared to draw swords, but Octavianus held out a cautioning hand.\"No matter what breed of monster we encounter,\" he said firmly. \"We do not attack unless we are attacked. Every creature deserves a chance to leave voluntarily.\" I could see Karnov struggle with this. Orcs had massacred his clan, but his strongly individualistic nature made him loath to put the blame for the actions of some creatures on an entire race. Ultimately, he bowed to Octavianus's leadership, but his hand never left his axe.We approached the orcs cautiously and with as much friendliness as one can muster with orcs. To their credit, they did not immediately attack. The largest--the leader--stepped forward but said nothing.\"Ho, orcs!\" Octavianus greeted. \"We come from the city of Phlan. It is the intention of the City Council to clear these ruins and make them safe for human habitation. We invite you and your fellows to withdraw and return to your lairs in the mountains.\"The game introduces some role-playing possibilities, first with the options to flee, fight, or parlay when confronting an enemy, and the with various options associated with speaking: haughty, sly, nice, meek, and abusive. I like to envision specific words associated with these selections as I play, as I did for \"nice\" above. Other options:Haughty: \"Oh, look. It's some filthy little orcs. I'm so scared. Comrades, if these mangy beasts don't flee within 10 seconds, we'll teach them a lesson about messing with the citizens of Phlan.\"Sly: \"Ah...orcs. I'm guessing you're not here by your own will any more than we are. What do you say we forget we saw each other and let our masters fight each other if they want to fight so badly?\"Meek: \"Hey, orc friends! I hope we haven't stumbled into the wrong place. We'll just turn around and head out that door there, if that's okay with you.\"Abusive: \"What the hell is this?! Orcs?! Get the %$^&@ out of our way!\"The monsters also have different dispositions. For instance, \"angry-looking\" monsters attack immediately, while \"seedy-looking\" ones are generally more willing to talk.Isn't this redundant?At my current level, none of the options do much to avoid battle. A couple of times, the monsters have offered to let us go for a bribe, but once you do that the first time, you never regain your self-respect. Thus, although the encounter almost always ends in battle, it's still an interesting set of options, and a definite step towards the more nuanced dialog and role-playing options available in later games. Plus, once the party levels up a few times, I think monsters become more willing to listen.The orcs exchanged glances. Probably they had only understood a few words, I thought, but then the leader turned out to be surprisingly articulate.\"The boss doesn't like your kind around here,\" the leader finally said in that strange, mucusy Orcish accent. \"But we'll forget we saw you--for a price.\"I heard Duskfire whisper to Lame Brain behind me: \"Who is the 'boss'? Some orc chieftain, or is there a greater power behind the Phlan infestation?\"\"We will pay nothing,\" Octavianus said. \"But we--\"It was all he got out. At his initial words, the leader gave a signal, the orcs unsheathed short swords, and before I knew what was happening, I was between Duskfire and Zink, stabbing at the furry monstrosities with my long sword. Ahead, I saw Karnov swinging his axe with a particular glee.I would like to say that we covered ourselves in glory, but both Duskfire and Zink took wounds that left them unconscious. Still, we slew them all--our first real battle against a monstrous foe--with none of our lives lost. We resisted the urge to retreat to the safety of the town. As Koren healed the fallen party members, I scavenged a handful of copper pieces and a couple of usable short swords from the corpses of our enemies. The swords would't sell for much back in Phlan, but every copper piece counts.The next ruins held similar encounters with patrols of kobolds and goblins. In each case, we offered the opportunity to flee, and in each case they attacked or tried to extort money from us. Lame Brain's and Duskfire's sleep spells proved invaluable against these base creatures, sending them into a magical slumber long enough for us to administer coups-de-grace. We took wounds but nothing serious.Unlike most D&D games I can remember, the \"sleep\" spell is quite valuable here, usually affecting all enemies in its 9-square radius.I owe you all a full posting on the tactical combat system, but I'm waiting until I level up a few times and have more options to write about. For now, suffice to say that my Level 1 party misses a lot, but so do the monsters. However, when they hit, it's usually enough to obliterate my five or six hit points and send the character unconscious immediately. I would also note that the random encounters tend to offer between 8 and 20 experience points each. With the next level requiring between 1,250 and 2,000 experience, and with most of my characters multi-classes, leveling up is going to take a while!Yay! 1/375th of the way to Level 2!The game has two options to search a room: \"look\" and \"search.\" \"Look\" does a one-time only scan that takes 10 minutes, while the \"search\" option stays on and causes you to run a \"look\" every time you take a step. I have just been leaving it on. There doesn't seem to be any penalty for the passage of time (your characters have ages but do not age in the game), and it doesn't seem to greatly increase the odds of random encounters.A bag of gems found in a stable.We moved through the ruins slowly, taking time to search for secret  doors, traps, and hidden objects. Although we rarely found anything, the  few times we did, we were grateful for having taken the extra time. One thing was certain: the City Clerk had greatly understated the extent of the monster infestation. Almost every room held a patrol, and a few rooms were clearly serving as temporary monster headquarters. In one room, for instance, we found a group of orcs sitting around a desk, arguing over some documents. They attacked us immediately and fell to our blades.The \"papers\" turned out to be a clerical scroll with cure light wounds spells.The game has a nice balance of random encounters and fixed encounters in the various game maps. The fixed encounters are usually more difficult and offer a greater experience reward, as well as a greater chance of finding magic items. I suspect that solving the quest to \"clear\" the slums involves finding and winning all of the fixed encounters.I should mention that unlike Might & Magic, The Bard's Tale, and even Ultima IV, Pool of Radiance remembers all of the outcomes of your fixed encounters even after you leave the map and return. Fixed monsters do not reappear, and you cannot find the same treasure more than once. This was true in previous games for some specific encounters, but this is the first game to implement this kind of permanence on a game-wide scale.Eventually, so loaded with copper and salvaged weapons that we could barely move, and bereft of spells, we decided to return to the city. A chance encounter with kobolds on the way left Lame Brain unconscious, but we managed to improvise a litter and drag him to the city. There, we checked into the inn and healed our wounded party members. [More on magic and memorizing spells in a later posting.] Unfortunately, all of the equipment we had brought back sold for a pittance. We had not amassed enough money to buy even a single armor or weapon upgrade. We grimly returned through the archway and retraced our steps.Carrying all this extra stuff got me about 5 gold pieces.We battled past several more patrols as our exploration took us to the southeast quadrant of the old city. By this time, each of us had several kills to our names, and Octavianus remarked with a combination of wonder and disgust how quickly we become used to the feeling of our swords and axes plunging into living flesh. As we uncomfortably pondered the implications of this, we came to a locked door. Karnov tried to pick it and failed, so Octavianus bashed it down.Against all probabilities, we found ourselves in the tidy home and laboratory of an old wizard who introduced himself as Ohlo. Without indulging in many pleasantries, he asked me to fetch a potion from the Old Rope Guild somewhere south of our location. Partly stunned by the encounter, we stammered out agreement and he sent us along, refusing our offers to fix his door.This was the first \"side quest\" in the game, and again we must note certain roleplaying opportunities, even if they are light ones. I had the option to attack Ohlo, for instance, although it would have certainly ended badly, and I had the option to reject the quest. Later, when I did return with the potion, I had the option to refuse to give it to him. The fact that an impossible battle happens if you do that...A high-level magic user and a horde of hobgoblins....doesn't change the fact that this is a real role-playing option, something we hardly ever see in quests in CRPGs of this era.The Rope Guild, occupying the southern part of the ruins, was a twisted maze that ultimately led us to an unlikely shop on the far eastern end. There, a friendly young alchemist--without explaining anything about what he was doing there or how he survived the monster infestation--gave us Ohlo's potion. Returning to him with it, we were rewarded with gold, several gems, and an enchanted long sword. Not bad for a simple fetch-and-carry job!This was a little unfair given that the game offers you no ability to avoid it.On the far western end of the Rope Guild area is the encounter whose screen shot starts this posting--a battle with three trolls and two ogres that is impossible to win with Level 1 characters. It would be hard even with Level 3 characters. I remembered it immediately when it commenced, even though the last time I played the game was about 17 years ago. My entire party was wiped out in the first round of attacks. This is the \"you all died\" screen, by the way:I hadn't saved since entering the ruins for the second time, so I had to reload and do Ohlo's quest again. Later, I encountered some battles with large groups of goblins and orcs that also left me dead. There are certain parts of the old slums that are very unsafe to enter.As we left the wizard's house for the second time, we noted that the ruins had gotten quieter, and that we were encountering fewer wandering parties of monsters. Were our efforts already making a difference in the old slums? Just as we started to think that we might be on the verge of clearing the area, we opened a door and blundered into a large, outdoor town square, and our illusions were disabused immediately. The square was swarming with orcs, hobgoblins, kobolds, goblins, and even some human mercenaries--which we must have looked like, since the monsters did not attack us.Wandering through the old Hemp Market, as the square was known, we overheard a hobgoblin taking about the \"hot-shot orc\" in charge of the enemy forces at \"the temple over the river.\" This was good intelligence to discover. From the Hemp Market, we could see a gate into other sections of Old Phlan, but after a quick conference, we decided to save the exploration of those ruins until after we cleared the immediate slums.Growing bolder in our explorations, we cleared out an ad-hoc goblin training school and slew a group of hobgoblins arguing over a pile of gold. A little battered, we longed to return to the comfort and safety of a Phlan inn, but in the interests of time, we decided to hole up and heal in an old storage room we found towards the northwest corner of the ruins. The next morning, nearby, we found walls completely surrounding a section of the city. Figuring there must be something inside, we tested the exterior walls and found a concealed door! Within the room, under the floorboards, was a fortune in gold and jewelry.The game gives experience rewards for just finding treasure. This is far more than I've received from any battle in the game.After this discovery, we were so laden with treasure that, although we had not finished our task of clearing the slums, we thought it would be prudent to return to the city. Octavianus suggested that, based on the experience we had gained battling monsters, we might stand to learn a few tricks from the trainers at the guild. The trek back was mercifully free of encounters.Guild training, it turns out, requires an absurd fee of 1,000 gold pieces per person! At first, we balked at this figure--far more than we had ever seen since joining together as a party. But then we visited a shop to sell our collected jewelry and gems and found, upon leaving the establishment with our jaws open, that we had more than 15,000 gold pieces together. One expedition has made us wealthier than we had ever imagined. If the city of Phlan did not need us, we might actually retire! At the very least, we no longer have to collect short swords from slain kobolds.My riches before pawning and consolidation.We went back to the guild and paid their usurious fee, but our visit seemed a bit premature. Octavianus learned a few fighting strategies from a trainer, and Koren, studying with a cleric, advanced her ability to cast spells. No one else was quite ready for new techniques.Yeah, so I had forgotten that with multi-classed characters, they were splitting their experience. I needed about 500 more experience points before everyone could advance. Leveling up, I should mention, requires visiting the guild and finding the right \"room\" for the class. It's interesting that Pool of Radiance implemented the pay-a-trainer method of leveling (much like Might & Magic) which I don't think is required by D&D rules.Returning to the shop, we had the shopkeeper appraise and identify all of the magical items we had discovered during the expedition, and we converted some of our gold to better equipment from the armory and the silver shop. When all was done, Octavianus the fighter was clad in plate mail and wielding a silver two-handed sword. Karnov the fighter/thief had leather armor +1, a silver long sword, and a ring of protection +1. Lame Brain was wielding a long sword +1, Zink and Koren had silver maces, and all of our party members with archery skills had short bows +1. [The magic items were all found in the ruins; the shops don't sell any magic items, which is a bit of an annoyance.]Karnov's inventory.We rested that evening content with our success, and eagerly plotting strategy to finish clearing the slums the next day.The game is still enormous fun--even better than I remember. I like the way it rewards you incrementally for clearing out small sections of an area, and that the fixed encounters are distinguishable (though subtly) from the random ones. I don't like leaving one area for another before fully exploring the first, though, so now that I have a couple extra levels, I'm going to take on a hireling and try the trolls again. More on that tomorrow.Before I go, I want to refer you to an amusing comic I've been reading online since one of the authors e-mailed me: \"Hi-Res Heroes.\" The opening strips poke fun at the Pool of Radiance codewheel, and the characters in the strip are drawn based on the \"Gold Box\" character combat icons. This one is my favorite so far, although I wish he'd used a \"wyvern\" instead.[Ed. I have kept this entry up for legacy reasons (there are a lot of comments), but I'm closing commenting as I've changed my policy on accepting recommendations for new games. Discussion of the master game list has moved to several subsequent entries.]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Just a quick note in advance of my next Pool of Radiance posting later: I have converted my \"game rankings\" Excel sheet to a Google spreadsheet (thanks to Canageek for showing me how easy it was, and to Wolf for giving me some particular motivation), and I have added a separate Google spreadsheet for my master game list.Some points on the second one:1. Please note that the list is current only through 2002. I have not fully reviewed the MobyGames databases for the years after that, only the Wikipedia list.2. I welcome your comments and corrections, particularly on the original release date vs. the DOS/PC release date. I don't know if I have that right for all of the games on the list, and it's important since I'm playing in order of the DOS/PC release date.3. Compilation packages should not appear on the list, so please let me know if you see one.4. Multiplayer games should not appear on the list unless they also have a single-player mode, so please let me know if you see one.5. For games that have undergone continuous development (e.g.,  many roguelikes), I will probably break them up into version categories and visit them multiple times. I need your advice on this, so if you know a game particularly well, please comment. I have already done this for NetHack.6. As we get into more modern times, I'll have to make a decision between treating expansion packs as new games or as sequels. I'm leaning towards treating them as new games if they occur within the game's main plot (e.g., Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast) but as separate games if they occur after the game's main plot (e.g., Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal).7. It's not that I don't care about your opinion, but please, if you see something that you think is not a CRPG, don't bring it up now. I'll deal with that when I get to the game. I have my own method for evaluating that. If, however, my list misses something that is a CRPG, please do respond.In any event, I'm sure I have a lot of errors and inconsistencies here, so please discuss."}, {"title": "Pool of Radiance: The Story Begins", "date": "Wednesday, June 1, 2011", "text": "The party in camp.\u00a0\u00a0 We met on the ship: six rank amateurs who, for one reason or another, couldn't return to our homes. Octavianus was the son of a noble from Cormyr who fled his home after his father led an unsuccessful rebellion against the king and was executed. Karnov was a blacksmith whose clan had lived in the Thunder Peaks. He had gone trading in Tilverton and returned the next day to find that orcs had risen from the depths of the mines and slaughtered every dwarf in the city.Lame Brain's merchant family had kicked him out of his native Sembia--and had given him his unfortunate nickname--after a mistaken punctuation mark on a contract forced them to trade six ships full of fabric for 13 silver pieces and a cursed girdle of femininity. Beautiful Duskfire, a shopkeeper, had fled Neverwinter ahead of a plague only to be picked up and sold into slavery by pirates. She was eventually bought by a kind wizard who taught her a few tricks before dying of old age. Zink was an acolyote at a temple of Waukeen in Amn who had been accused (falsely) of stealing church funds. Finally, Koren was a descendant of Phlan's original settlers. Her family owned an inn in Hillsfar and, growing up, she listened to them talk and talk about someday reclaiming the city. She decided to do something about it.One by one, we made our way to Hillsfar, picking up a few skills and bits of knowledge along the way and choosing the paths that would become our professions. In the city, we encountered--on every street corner, it seemed--posters proclaiming riches and glory in Phlan, and each of us sold the last of our possessions--horses, jewelry, heirlooms--to procure passage across the Moonsea and to buy arms when we arrived. The ship was crammed with adventurers like us, and I know not what caused the six of us to find each other, recognize something different, and take each meal together. Perhaps we all recognized that none of us had anything to lose; that we had no other place to go. Whatever the cause, by the time we stepped off the ship at the docks and encountered a tiresome local named Rolf, we had become a party.The civilized section of Phlan.The maps in Pool of Radiance are 16 x 16, and almost all of the squares are used. The civilized section of Phlan was fairly easy to map, as there were no encounters, and many of the shops were clones of each other. Between the six of us, we had almost 550 gold pieces, and it was a measure of the bond we'd already established that no one objected to simply pooling our gold to make our equipment purchases. Octavianus bought a wicked-looking great sword, Karnov went with a battle axe, Lame Brain and Duskfire both outfitted themselves with long swords, and Zink and Koren hung maces on their belts. With the remaining gold, we bought what armor and missile weapons we could afford.The creators of the game took pains to ensure that every non-magical weapon from the AD&D rules was included in the shop. I could be wrong, but I don't think any other D&D-based game features glaive-guisarmes, fauchard forks, and becs-de-corbin.This is too bad, because becs-de-corbin rock.I suspect you could count on one hand the number of players who have ever bothered with these more obscure weapons. There's hardly any reason to. The game's own manual says that the long sword does the most damage of any one-handed weapon, and a two-handed sword does the most damage of any two-handed weapon. For clerics, the obvious choice is a mace or flail. You have to admire the attention to detail but wonder at the waste.I'm pretty sure the game was based on the first edition of the D&D rules, which had the race level caps (as we discussed yesterday) but also had fewer equipment restrictions on multi-classed characters. My fighter/cleric cannot equip bladed weapons (oddly, he can't equip a morningstar or sling, either), but my fighter/magic users are happily wandering around in long swords and mail, and my fighter/thief seems to have no problem with metallic armor.Although you find coins of all denominations in the game--copper, silver, electrum, gold, and platinum--when you make transactions at stores, your money automatically gets changed to platinum pieces, which prevents you from having to lug around too many coins. Coins and items have weight, and they limit the number of moves each character can make in combat. I remember abandoning heaps of coins in previous plays just so I could effectively fight.Thus equipped, Zink insisted that we check out the nearest tavern. I thought it an odd suggestion for a priest, but he pointed out that taverns are usually the places for the best local intelligence. The common room was dominated by an anglish lord, boasting at the top of his lungs about his adventures, but we ignored him and pressed into the back rooms. In the midst of gambling and winning several platinum pieces, we heard that a group of ogres east of Phlan were holding a princess captive. Somebody also mentioned a silver dragon living in the Dragonspine Mountains. But a crazy man screaming about a man called \"Turtle,\" walls that weren't there, and living daggers drowned out any other attempts at intelligence-gathering.In other words, even odds.Unfortunately, we had only been in the tavern a short time when the tensions caused by the huge influx of adventurers arriving on our ship erupted, and we found ourselves smashed between eight armed and drunken mercenaries and a company of the city guard. With no other recourse, we took the side of the guard. The mercenaries gave us no chance to offer them quarter. Karnov took a blow to the head and fell unconscious. With no other options, we grimly felled them and then suffered the added indignity of fleeing from the city guards, who apparently could not tell aggressor from defender. Lacking the funds necessary to pay for Karnov's healing, we rented a room at an inn, and over almost nine hours of resting, Zink and Koren memorized and cast \"Cure Light Wounds\" until our party was hale again. The magic users also took this opportunity to memorize sleep spells.Facing down a group of brawlers. I'll talk more about combat--including the fact that NPCs sometimes fight on your side--in a future posting.Taverns are deadly to first-level adventurers. Every few steps, a brawl breaks out for one reason or another. I stopped visiting after I fought two of them.One of the great things about playing this game in the Internet age is that I can use the Forgotten Realms Wiki to look up things about deities, cities, races, monsters, and other aspects of D&D lore that the creators of Pool of Radiance simply couldn't fit into the game. I wish I'd had this when I was a kid. I've always been confused about how the god pantheon is organized in Faer\u00fbn, and now I know.Resuming our exploration of the small city, we found temples dedicated to Tempus, the god of battles, Sune, the goddess of love and beauty, and Tyr, the god of justice. In addition to several arms and armor shops, there were stores selling silver items--handy if we need to face undead--holy relics, and expensive jewelry of all things. The city park was drab and lifeless, and the Barren River to the north of the city was foul and poisoned.I think the only use for this stuff is to tie up large amounts of gold in less-weighty items.When we felt we had a strong sense of the layout of Phlan, we decided to approach City Hall about our first commission. There were four proclamations posted outside. Three of them concerned the Valhigen Graveyard: the Council wants to know about reports of undead roaming the graveyard, and wants a report on previous missions and mercenaries sent to inspect it. The fourth simply asked interested adventurers to clear out the monster-inhabited sections of the old city. I consulted with my fellows. Zink, who bears a special hatred for undead, wanted to stalk out for the cemetery at once, but the rest of us persuaded him that a little experience with less dangerous enemies was probably best for the time being.The screenshots below show the in-game proclamations and the related text highlighted in the Adventurer's Journal. It's odd that the quest for Valhigen Graveyard--which I think is a fairly high-level quest--is showing up in the proclamations so soon:We stepped inside the building and paid a visit to the pleasant but dutiful city clerk. She reiterated that the old city needed to be cleared of monsters but also gave us two commissions that were not listed in the proclamations: the scouring of Sokal Keep on an island near Phlan, and a general quest to find any maps, books, or other materials that provide information about the city before its destruction.We left City Hall and stepped into the bright sunshine and looked nervously at each other, as if wondering which of us would be the first to fall. Duskfire half-heartedly suggested that we spend one more night resting up in the inn before taking on the monsters, but even as the words left her lips, she knew what we all knew: there was no use waiting any longer. Not knowing whether we'd find bugbears or beholders on the other side, we marched through the gate and into the old ruins.They won't be suspicious when I return triumphant!I can't say for sure that I'll keep up with all the storytelling, but I can say that this is one of the few games that makes me want to tell it like a story. This game and Ultima IV offer the first game worlds, so far, that are large and yet maintain thematic integrity. The two Might & Magic games I've played so far are great games, no doubt, but the sci-fi angle doesn't work very well, and both have assorted goofiness that distract you from the plot and story. Most of the other games I've played are simply too limiting in their scenarios or role-playing options to be great \"stories.\"I don't want to suggest that Dungeons & Dragons is the end-all, be-all of roleplaying. There are plenty of great franchises out there. But the D&D games do benefit from a familiar world and a consistent set of rules and expectations. Because the Forgotten Realms has so much existing lore, the game world feels a lot larger than the extent you can travel in the game itself.None of this quite explains why setting out on a quest to clear ruins of monsters feels somehow more heroic than saving an entire planet, which is what most CRPGs ask you to do. Perhaps the unpretentiousness of the task makes it easier to view the PCs as real characters with a real story to tell.To make the game as fun and challenging as possible, I'm going to follow my usual rules. Only one save per game map, and reloads are only permitted in cases of full-party death (barring cases in which I want to explore an alternate path for purposes of the blog). Slain characters must be raised or replaced.Off to the ruins!"}, {"title": "Game 57: Pool of Radiance (1988)", "date": "Tuesday, May 31, 2011", "text": "Pool of RadianceUnited StatesStrategic Simulations, Inc. (developer and publisher)Released 1988 for DOS and Commodore 64; 1989 for Apple II, Macintosh, PC-88, and PC-98; 1990 for Amiga and Sharp X1, 1991 for NESDate Started: 31 May 2011\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I only ever played about eight or ten sessions of pen-and-paper Dungeons & Dragons, and those were enough for me. On paper, there's no reason I shouldn't love it. I've played hundreds of hours of D&D-themed computer games. I love fantasy novels and fantasy movies. I really enjoy reading D&D rulebooks and modules. I just don't like playing with a real dungeon master and real players.I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why, and these are the best theories I can come up with:Pen-and-paper roleplaying takes too damned long. By the time you get to the location, get settled, open the chips, pour the drinks, get out the paperwork, roll characters for the new players, set up the campaign, and generally stop screwing around, hours have gone by. You can easily spend half a dozen sessions getting through a simple module.Because you're playing with other people, you can't just get up and leave whenever you want. And you have to mesh your schedule with theirs. There's no suddenly deciding to play at 01:00 when you can't sleep.It's tough to find a talented DM. If he's too imaginative, the game feels more like he's telling a story than you're playing. If he's too lenient, there's no challenge. If he's too inflexible, say goodbye to your character.There are a million rules and calculations, and the game comes to a standstill every five or six rounds as you roll dice and try to figure out whether your saving throw really applies to this particular use of poison or whatever.If you don't have three or four friends who like D&D, you end up playing with strangers. If you do have three or four friends who like D&D, you start to wonder about the choices you've made.For all these reasons, despite its long history as a paper game, D&D has always struck me as a natural computer-based game system. A computer can do the calculations. You don't need friends with a computer. You can play with your computer any time you want. Your computer is an impartial DM. The only thing lacking with CRPGs over regular RPGs is a certain amount of open-endedness and flexibility. I can't suddenly decide to abandon Baldur's Gate and stalk off towards Silverymoon. But many CRPGs offer worlds that are enormous if not boundless, and this is usually good enough for me.The game's first quest.Pool of Radiance isn't the first D&D adaptation for the computer. Wikipedia says that was the PLATO-based dnd, followed by the PDP-10-based Dungeon, two handheld games from Mattel, and an Intellivision game. To a lesser extent, of course, practically ever fantasy CRPG listed on this blog is a D&D adaptation--just not an officially-licensed one. But Pool of Radiance was the first true CRPG adaptation of the specific D&D rules. (Heroes of the Lance, released the same year, was a side-scrolling action game.) It showed that D&D-style gameplay, character development, NPCs, and tactics could be adapted to the computer, and it introduced the idea of the \"campaign setting\" to CRPGs; games don't have to be direct sequels to each other to be set in the same world. Pool of Radiance and its three sequels are all set in the same realm as Eye of the Beholder, Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Neverwinter Nights, and once you know the geography, races, magics, religions, monsters, and politics of one game, you can use that knowledge in others.None of this would be particularly interesting if the gameplay didn't work, but a few hours with Pool of Radiance confirms what I remember: this is an awesome game. It has a great plot, an extensive game world, and a lot of lore. It is tactically challenging and reasonably fast-paced. There are a few things not to like--sparse first-person graphics and a tiresome healing process among them--but they're certainly sufferable.The Gold Box series perfects SSI's tactical combat system.Part of the game's charm is the back story, which is satisfying in its own modesty. You're not out to save the world or become a god or anything. Rather, your job is to help restore a ruined city called Phlan, a minor port on the Moonsea. Once prosperous, it was overrun by monsters a few hundred years ago and fell into disrepair. But descendants of its old inhabitants have now reclaimed it, set up a City Council, hired guards, and walled off a \"civilized\" section, and they are now soliciting for mercenary bands to start cleaning out the monster-inhabited sections of the city.An advertisement for mercenaries, from the Adventurer's Journal.One of the satisfying things about replaying this game in the Internet age is that I can finally see where the Moonsea is, relative to other lands of the Forgotten Realms (technically called \"Faer\u00fbn\"). The Forgotten Realms Wiki has a full map, which I've included below along with some annotations as to the (rough) relative locations of certain games.\u00a0\u00a0 You begin by creating a party of six characters from all six core D&D races (human, dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, halfling), both sexes, nine alignments, and four classes (cleric, fighter, magic user, and thief). Normally, I would set out to create a set of characters that I could use throughout the four \"Gold Box\" games, but a somewhat clumsy implementation of the D&D rules in this first game means that I'll probably create a new set of characters for the next game, Curse of the Azure Bonds. First, there are no paladins or rangers in this game. Second, non-human races have level maximums and I have to make sure they aren't lower than the maximum level in the game. Third, there are maximum levels in the game, ranging from Level 6 for wizards and clerics to Level 9 for thieves. But these are level maximums, not experience maximums, so it makes sense to use multi-classed characters, thus ensuring that you never have the infuriating experience of not earning any more experience.Thus, my party:Octavianus: chaotic good male human fighter (possibly to dual to cleric later)Karnov: neutral male dwarf fighter/thiefLame Brain: neutral good male elf fighter/magic userDuskfire: lawful good female [sorry about that man, but I needed another female, and frankly it sounds like a female's name] half-elf fighter/magic userZink: lawful neutral male half-elf fighter/clericKoren: neutral good female human cleric (possibly to dual to fighter later)This leaves no halfling, but they suck at everything but thievery and I don't recall thieves playing a large role in this game.Octavianus, I hope that works for you.As you create your character, you get to select from a number of heads and bodies to create your character portrait. Most of the portrait choices look pretty dumb, and I think this is the only Gold Box game to include them. You also select from various colors and styles to create your character icon. I'm colorblind, so I usually just focus on the weapon and head style and randomize everything else. I'm sure it looks stupid.\u00a0\u00a0 Right at the beginning, the game gives you the ability to cheat wildly. After creating your characters, no matter what attribute statistics they originally received, you can choose to \"modify\" them and change the statistics to whatever you want. The ostensible reason for this, given in the manual, is: \"You may want to bring your favorite AD&D character into Pool of Radiance. Create a character of the same race and class and then modify it to match your non-computer AD&D character.\" Sure. All around the world, Pool of Radiance players suddenly had paper D&D characters with every attribute set at 18.When I played Pool of Radiance the first time, in 1988, and the second time, in probably 1995, I happily engaged in this type of cheating, but not this time. It's hardly necessary anyway. Rarely does the game offer you single-digit attribute statistics. These were the numbers I got for Lame Brain after only three or four re-rolls:His intelligence belies his name. His face does not.Your characters start with no equipment and roughly 100 gold pieces per person. The game begins on the docks of Phlan, your mercenary ship presumably having just arrived. You are greeted by a townsman named Rolf who proceeds to give you a quick tour of the city and the major edifices.Hey! We must be related!Rolf shows the Temple of Tyr, the docks, the training facility, City Hall, Sune's Temple, City Park, and the entrance to the \"monster-ridden areas of the old city.\" He then leaves the party alone to begin its adventure. This posting is already getting long, so I'll get into the real meat of the gameplay tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0 Before I go, though, we must discuss the game's documentation. The game comes with an interesting construction called a \"codewheel\" that serves as both a copy protection device and a translator. The codewheel has two overlapping rings--one inner, one outer--and at the beginning of each session, the game asks you to match up two runes and tell it what word is found along one of three paths.\u00a0\u00a0 Lacking a physical copy, I was in the middle of creating a complicated PowerPoint-based solution when it suddenly hit me that someone must have programmed a little applet for this somewhere. Sure enough, I found a web site that allows you to do the selections quite easily. And guess who created it. That's right: Andrew freaking Schultz, the \"king of classic CRPG walkthroughs\". Did this guy do everything? It's actually not hosted on his own site any more, and the current hosts note that they can't reach him. I couldn't reach him, either, when I wrote about walkthroughs. Where did he go?The second piece of important documentation is the Adventurer's Journal, which is almost unique in CRPGs of the era, although the concept was seen first way back in Temple of Apshai and taken to something of an extreme in Star Saga. To account for the limitations in on-screen text and cut scenes of the era, the creators described key encounters, including visuals such as maps and diagrams, in a 57-entry Adventurer's Journal. At key points, the game cues you to open the journal and read one or more of the entries. Lest you be tempted to read ahead, they randomized the order of entries and included several red herrings among the real ones.A random journal entry. This is the last time I look one up before the game tells me to.The Journal also contains a collection of 23 \"tavern tales\" that you hear in bars. My first tavern tale was that \"buccaneers operate a slave auction out of a hidden camp near Stormy Bay.\" Finally, it contains the quest proclamations that you find outside City Hall.My characters have just arrived in town, so my first goal is to get some equipment. I still remember the first time I played the game, when I got embroiled in a huge tavern brawl before I had any weapons, and all my characters died. After that, I'll map the town and see what quests await me at City Hall. A warning for the next few weeks: I'm probably going to drag this one out."}, {"title": "Advertisements on the CRPG Addict. And Pizza.", "date": "Monday, May 30, 2011", "text": "Readers,On May 30, 2011, I decided to explore adding advertisements to the CRPG Addict. I had promised my wife--who didn't know about the blog for its first year of existence--that I would at least try to get some revenue out of it, so we could have dinner once a month as some compensation for all of the nights I was blogging instead of sleeping next to her. (Though to be fair, Irene, when you read this: I do lots of other work in the middle of the night, too. I have the e-mails to prove it!)This being a Google-hosted blog, the ads come from Google AdSense. AdSense had a set of terms and conditions so long that I suspect I may be violating them by even talking about them. (I suspect I may be violating them when I brush my teeth or feed my cat, too.) AdSense, as I understand it, scans the blog for keywords and tries to target ads to the blog's likely audience. A fair number of game and MMORPG ads seem to show up, for instance. In the first 24 hours, there have also been a lot of ads for the Geek2Geek dating site. Can't imagine what on my blog must have triggered those.It's important to understand that I don't have direct control over what ads appear. It draws them from a pool. I can make some tweaks, but I can't say that I don't want to see any more from a specific company, or that I don't want to see any more with scantily-clad elves. At that same time, my understanding is that Google polices these companies very well, so you should never see overt pornography, ads for anything illegal, or ads that take you to malware sites. If you do experience any of these--or anything else offensive--let me know (best to take a screen shot, too, since the ads change on every reload). One thing I can do is switch to text-only ads, but I actually think they look worse against my site background, so I only want to do that if the images are problematic.My primary purpose in writing this blog is to write about something I enjoy, so I'll dump the ads if they cause problems or if too many readers complain. The initial reaction to my announcement (see the note below and the comments attached) were mostly supportive, and I've taken the comments received so far as an a-okay. But keep using this posting to comment about your concerns or problems with the ads (I read every comment, no matter how old).Finally, I appreciate if you turn of Adblock for my site, but of course I understand if you don't. Please click on the ads if you're honestly interested in visiting those advertisers, but please do not think you're doing me any favors by clicking on ads that don't interest you. Google has algorithms that seek out \"click fraud,\" and the amount of money I stand to make from ads is not worth any associated legal issues.As always, thanks for your readership and support.Best,ChetNote: This posting originally announced my intention to try ads and asked if the readers were okay with that. I know it's not usually kosher to modify a posting so much after people have commented, but I didn't want this topic to take up multiple postings on the blog, and I wanted to have a posting I could link to permanently.Note 2: Ignore this paragraph below, and the title.  I'm testing out a hypothesis.Pizza! Boy could I go for a pizza right now! A nice, thick-crust, hand-tossed pizza, maybe with mushrooms and black olives, or maybe ham and pineapple. Yes, sir, I sure am in the market for a good pizza!I did something better than winning. I \"achieved maximal entropy.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I know that when I last blogged about Omega, I was still trying to win for real, but the corruptions kept piling up on themselves, and pretty soon I couldn't recognize half of my equipment. The final straw came when my save game got corrupted. I had some other backups from a couple hours earlier, but I would have lost a lot of playing and I couldn't guarantee that it wouldn't happen again.Part of me wants to keep playing. I found a later version on a different web site, and there's a chance that it fixes a lot of the bugs I encountered. It also has color!\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But I can't see investing the kind of time it would take to rebuild a character right now, especially with Pool of Radiance waiting for me. So I'm going to do my GIMLET and see if I can find an excuse to be pulled back to Omega later. Keeping that possibility open, I've avoided looking at any walkthroughs or spoiler files.If you have to go...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. Game World. The world of Omega is extensive if not terribly well-described. It has a major city (Rampart), several towns, castles, dungeons, mountains, forests, and other features. More important is the struggle between order and chaos that is present in every aspect of gameplay. This lore is found in the scrolls of Rampart's library and in clues you pick up throughout the game. This is the only roguelike I've played that has bothered to create a backstory and lore for its world. Score: 5.Studying in the library.2. Character Creation and Development. Omega allows a fascinating type of character creation in which you can \"play yourself,\" answering questions about your own lifestyle and attributes to generate your character. Naturally, there is a temptation to lie during this process (warning: the game notes the most outrageous ones), but it's still exceedingly clever, and the most original system this side of Ultima IV. The development process is also satisfying: there are various ways to increase your attributes, and lots of quests, battles, and special encounters to increase experience and levels. The \"guild\" system is a nice touch--I think this might actually be the first CRPG to allow membership in multiple competing guilds, especially based on alignment. And it's satisfying how you can level in both experience and guild memberships, obtaining items, skills, and spells as you do so. Your alignment and guild memberships affect how others treat you, and this is one of the first games to really allow \"role-playing\" by alignment. My score of 7 for this category has this game tying with Dungeon Master with a high so far.Some of the game's character development questions.3. NPC Interaction. There are NPCs in the game--guards, the Oracle, the Archdruid, the Duke, the Archmage, wandering merchants--but conversation is one-way. The ability to intimidate, bribe, or pick their pockets is an interesting addition but not the same thing as having dialog options. Score: 3.Intimidating a guard.4. Encounters and Foes. The game is similar to Rogue or NetHack in its wide selection of monsters, each with different strengths and weaknesses. Most of the encounters are random, and levels do respawn when you leave and return. I didn't find any scripted encounters, but the game does offer role-playing choices in regular encounters. There are non-hostile monsters, for instance, and attacking them moves you towards chaos, while attempting to talk to hostile monsters (I think) moves you towards law. The game makes clever references to other fictions and mythologies without being goofy about it. Score: 6.5. Magic and Combat. Omega does one better than traditional roguelikes by giving you multiple attacks per round and letting you set a \"combat sequence\" of high, medium, and low slashes, thrusts, lunges, or blocks. It's not as detailed as Might & Magic but it's better than Rogue. The layout of dungeons adds tactics to combat as you try to position yourself in the best locations, and you can try to escape by vaulting or tunneling through walls.  Spells are acquired slowly and cast with a \"mana\" system. This was one thing I didn't understand: my spell points kept draining when I rested, and I have no idea why. Score: 5.Kibfizma's selection of spells.6. Equipment. Like other roguelikes, this game excels in its large selection of equipment: weapons, armor, rings, accessories, cloaks, boots, wands, potions, scrolls, food, and other items. The locations of most are randomized, and the + levels and relative costs, plus the changes they make to your hit, damage, defense, armor, and speed scores, makes it easy to weigh one item against another. What I like about Omega in contrast to Rogue or NetHack is that you can pay to identify your items in town, or by spell, instead of having to figure them out through trial-and-error and the occasional rare scroll. I have to give it a high score here: 8.7. Economy. Simply put: one of the best I've seen. Gold is hard to acquire and easy to spend, just as it should be. Even advanced characters will still find use for gold in buying the condo, using the gym, studying at the library, recharging mana, or just donating to the orphanage. If you really ran out of things to do, you could keep making repeat visits to the brothel (500 gold) for 100 experience points each. Score: 8.The gym gives you the option to build your attributes for 2000 gold a point.8. Quests. I never quite got a handle on what the \"main quest\" was supposed to accomplish, but there are a number of side quests, for guilds, the duke, and the oracle. They're mostly kill-and-fetch endeavors, but still more than most CRPGs of the era offer. The main quest seems to offer several pathways to the end, which is another first. Score: 5.9. Graphics, Sound, Inputs. This is the game's weakest area. I realize that many roguelike fans find a certain noble purity in ASCII graphics, but I would have enjoyed the game all the more if it had featured real graphics and animation. There is no sound. I found the controls to be less intuitive than some roguelikes, especially as regards the complexity of the inventory system. Score: 1.10. Gameplay. This is one of the only games of the era to encourage such replayability, both in alignment and in the guilds that the player joins. Again, it allows multiple paths to victory, and it is fairly non-linear. On the negative side are the difficulty (permanent death is a little untenable) the unnecessarily large dungeons, and the whole wilderness/food headache. Even though I enjoyed playing it, it was starting to drag a bit, and I suspect I might have gotten a little tired of it before it was over. Score: 5.The final score of 53 ties it with Starflight and Ultima IV in third place of all the games I've reviewed so far. Only the time factor keeps me from launching into a new game with different guild choices. I still might, after Pool of Radiance. I'm sure I haven't even scratched the surface of what's possible in this game, especially as regards the religious system. I'll do an update if I play again later. Or perhaps some of you who play Omega can share your experiences.In our e-mail exchange, Mr. Brothers notes that he only ever received around $200 from dedicated players. Well, I certainly enjoyed myself enough to increase his earnings by about 12.5%. There's an Amazon.com gift card coming your way, Laurence--thanks for such an innovative and enjoyable game."}, {"title": "Omega: Sort-of Won!", "date": "Sunday, May 29, 2011", "text": "Not a terribly exciting winning screen. But then, I didn't win in a terribly exciting way.Unfortunately, Omega has a few bugs. It happens even with the best software. They started creeping into the gameplay shortly after I finished the Goblin Caves. Items got renamed with nonsense characters. When I hold a two-handed weapon, the game sometimes thinks it's two separate items and assigns me the weight of both. I deposited 4,000 gold in the bank, and it was gone when I returned. An outdoor fight went bad, and all my commands just made nonsense characters appear on the screen.I am actually armed with an Axe +6, not \"gold pieces +6,\" and I am wearing a ring of strength +2, not an \"0^C^A)F&&\\%fuX&&\\^A +2.\"But not all the bugs are bad. I went to the pawn shop and asked for an item letter that wasn't being displayed. I was told that that item (another random string of characters) cost -67,348 gold. I bought it, and suddenly had over 70,000 gold pieces. With this money, I bought a condo and retired--the game's least satisfying way of winning.I'm not actually going to end the game here. I restored an earlier save from before I made the transaction. But it might get to the point where there are so many bugs I can no longer play. We'll see how long I can go on.On the real main quest, the sewers beneath Rampart were rendered a bit faster by a series of elevators. In only about an hour, I was exploring Level 18, where I found the Great Wyrm. It took me three or four reloads to kill him, but ultimately I got his head and the duke's sword, and I headed for the surface. I didn't find any elevators on the way back, so getting out took considerably longer than getting in.Returning to the duke, I was congratulated, promoted, and asked to kill a dragon and get some dragonscale armor. I have no idea where to find it. Meanwhile, the Oracle wanted me to find the ArchMage's Castle.More references discovered: Occasionally, you encounter a parrot in the dungeons. If you kill it, the game says \"the parrot is dead!\" in a probable Monty Python reference. (I've already risked your disdain by telling you about my dislike for anime and Lord of the Rings, so I'll also confess that I can't stand Monty Python.) If it's not, the \"holy hand grenade\" I discovered in the ArchMage's Castle certainly is. In the sewers, I found a \"rodent of unusual size\" from The Princess Bride. There were banshees, but spelled sort-of like the original Gaelic way, \"ban-sidhe.\" There were also some Tritons from Greek legend.With no particular idea where to go next, I began exploring the outdoors. As I said early in posting about this game, wandering the wilds is annoying because you get hungry every two or three steps. You have to carry dozens of buckets of food with you to keep from starving to death. Aside from that, the outdoor area seems quite large. I found a few towns scattered about, and each helped me with a map shop that gave me a map of the surrounding area.This would be a good time to mention the economy, which is excellent in this game. As I discussed long ago, I like the process of collecting gold and spending it, and I don't like games that leave you with nothing to do with your riches. I don't think that's a problem here. Between the condo at 50,000 gold, working out at the gym, buying things in the pawn shop, recharging spell points, buying maps, and donating to charities (if you're lawful), I don't think there's any way to have too much money.The outdoor map is large, and all kinds of things can happen on it, including \"chaos storms\" that either kill you or leave you having \"learned something\" and thus with more experience. There are also random encounters that take you to a \"tactical map.\" With all of the difficulties, it would be nice if all of the dungeons and castles were visible on the map, but they're not: you have to \"search\" for them, and with such a large map it's hard to imagine searching every step. Fortunately, in the case of the ArchMage's Castle, I found a secret mountain pass that obviously led to something, and so I knew enough to search at the end.Finally, as I close for the day, on Level 2 of the ArchMage's Castle, this might be the truest-to-life experience I've ever had playing a CRPG:Casa Mia, Kennewick, WA, 2002. Trying to impress a girl. Ended up at Kennewick General Hospital instead."}, {"title": "Omega: Low Expectations, High Satisfaction", "date": "Saturday, May 28, 2011", "text": "My current status in the sewers of Rampart. Note that the corridors are thin and long, as you might expect in sewers.My e-mail exchange with Laurence Brothers, recounted yesterday, had me feeling bad about cheating in Omega. After all, he had a good point: the game is not impossibly difficult if you take care and make smart choices. Allowing myself to save once per level, I caught myself following the letter rather than the spirit of my own rules. Sure, I can't reload after I accidentally don a cursed set of armor, but that doesn't mean I have to try my best against the next goblin chieftain I encounter. Oh, look at that: he killed me. I guess I'll have to reload.So I started thinking that I should stop backing up my saves. And then this happened:I was doing nothing more risky than walking down a hallway, when suddenly a hole opened up beneath me and I was--let me quote the game--\"killed by warping into magma from the infinite abyss.\" Huh?This game was developed in the tradition of Rogue, but a complete game of Rogue, if you don't die, takes only a few hours. Omega is looking like it's going to take days to win, even with backing up my saves. So I once again reject permanent death: I will continue to backup my save files, and you'll hear no more about it.I played for a number of hours today, exploring both the Goblin Caves and the sewers beneath Rampart. Here are some new developments and discoveries.Ages before Neverwinter Nights would do it for what I thought was the first time,  Omega allows you to buy and find trap components, and set up your own traps to ensnare, bomb, poison, pierce, slash, and otherwise kill your enemies. Sometimes, when you disarm a found trap, you can preserve the components and later set up your own--again, just like Neverwinter Nights. Unlike NN, though, Omega allows you to accidentally blunder into your own trap.Occasionally, I find a \"Scroll of Hint\" that tells me something about the game world. One of them told me that \"only a master of chaos would kill all the city guards!\" I guess this is a title I could strive for. This game clearly equates chaos with evil.One of the monsters I fought was a \"pencil-necked geek.\" I vaguely remember a song of this title on the \"Dr. Demento\" radio show in the 1980s, and it turns out I was right. It was sung by Johnny Legend.Another monster was an \"etheric grue,\" an obvious homage to Zork. I found a Wand of Summoning that I figured would summon monsters to fight for me. Instead, they just attack me. One of my more memorable deaths is when I used it and it summoned an Archangel, who in turn summoned three or four more Archangels, and they killed me in one round. There are a couple of helpful teleportation spells in the game. I stumbled upon the Explorer's Club in Rampart fairly late, and was given a spell called \"Return\" that takes me back to the lowest-explored level after I leave a dungeon and return. Another spell called \"Warp\" (which I don't have, but have found on a scroll) takes me to any dungeon level. Between the two of these, I can get in and out of a dungeon quickly. Unfortunately, I didn't have them while exploring the Goblin Caves, and it took me forever to get to Level 10 (where the king was) and back.In the Goblin Caves, I found the Amulet of Yendor! I assume it must be a joke, as it doesn't do anything and it sells for 0 gold pieces.For a moment, I thought I won the game.An awesome scroll I found educated me about all other scrolls. This means I no longer have to identify them. Of course, this isn't a big deal any more because I learned the \"Identify\" spell at the Collegium Magii.Hopefully, Jane also published guides to potions, rings, and wands. I don't know what the reference to Jane is, but I strongly encourage you not to Google \"Jane's Guide.\"It turns out the brothel imparts 100 experience points for the 500 gold you spend there. After a long series of progressive raids on the Goblin Caves, I found the Goblin King on the 10th level, killed him, and took his head. A \"far-off woman's\" voice said, \"Well done! Come to me now...\"When I returned the head to the Duke of Rampart, he gave me another quest to find a sword in the city's sewers. The Oracle also told me to head down there, so that's what I'm doing next. I've explored nine levels and nothing so far.How about now that I've proven myself true, a comfortable retirement in the country?The Goblin King had a weapon called the \"Goblin's Hewer +6,\" which does massive damage but is two-handed, so I can't hold a shield. My character continues to develop. Various scrolls, potions, trips to the gym, and other bonuses have attributes fairly high (my intelligence somehow went from 12 to 19 in a couple of hours without my noticing), and I have some cool items, including a ring of regeneration +7.I really didn't expect to play Omega this long, but the dungeons are quite large, and for a roguelike of the era, it has an enormous amount of plot. (If it lasts too much longer, I might save the rest for after Pool of Radiance, because I'm really eager to get to that game.) I can't think of many other games for which I had such low expectations (\"ho, hum: another roguelike\") and such a high level of satisfaction once I actually started playing. What are some of your favorites in this category?"}, {"title": "Omega: Everything is a Reference", "date": "Friday, May 27, 2011", "text": "The stuff that dreams are made of. (Incidentally, it turned out to be worth 0.)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Okay, first off: I didn't \"interview\" Laurence Brothers. I don't know how to properly conduct an interview. I did trade some e-mails with him and got some background information on the game. I'll drop in his quotes when appropriate. His most important insight was that \"almost everything in the game comes from some fictional reference,\" including mythology. I'm catching some of them. There's The Maltese Falcon above, and I found a (useless) \"sword that was broken\" that I imagine is a Lord of the Rings reference (I also have some  lembas wafers). Is the Goblin King a reference to Labyrinth, or is that too generic? We have deities from different pantheons: Odin (Norse), Athena (Greek), Set (Egyptian), and Hecate (Roman), and of course the Oracle is Greek. The \"Lords of Destiny\" might be a reference to a 1985 Dr. Who roleplaying game. The curse in Romani, which an anonymous commenter translated a couple of days ago, comes from a book by Charles de Lint (\"yeah, it turns out that curse is a lot more vile than I thought\"). I've probably missed a million others.I don't think Mr. Brothers looked at my blog even after I invited him to, but it's funny how similarly we write and think about games. \"One of my proudest achievements in school,\" he writes, \"was winning a Rogue game fair and square without hacking it at all.\" Indeed, this is what started my blog! He notes that when you die in Rogue, \"you just gnash your teeth and start a new game,\" which I had phrased as, \"dying, screaming, and reloading.\" He does say that he intended Omega to be as hard as it is, and he deliberately implemented permanent death with Rogue-style difficulty in mind.However, he notes that, \"Omega is actually not that hard if you know all the tricks and secrets,\" and he suggested that one of them was hacking the ATM machine in Rampart for some extra cash (I haven't done this yet). Ironically, since I announced a couple of days ago that I would be cheating at Omega by backing up my saved games, I have only died twice. An anonymous commenter wrote yesterday that once you gain a few levels, \"your character becomes much more durable,\" and I'm finding that to be true.Let's talk about the things I've done and discovered since the last posting.I owe a debt to yet another anonymous commenter (what's with all these anonymous folks lately?) for explaining the \"Combat Maneuver Sequence.\" Not only was I being inefficient in my combat, I also wasn't using all of the actions that I could have taken. No wonder the fights were so hard.I got down to Level 6 of the Goblin Caves. I still haven't found the king yet. I keep returning to Rampart every time my pack is full, where my kind associates at the Thieves' Guild identify all my items for 5 gold pieces each. Man, I wish there was a similar option in NetHack. On my first trip to the caves, I realized belatedly that I had wandered over there with just a club. I got a great axe from a goblin chieftain, but Kibfizma turned out to suck with it for some reason, and I ended up using a dagger until I found something better.The best advantage I've ever gotten from a guild.I've joined two more factions. I became an acolyte of the Lords of Destiny and an associate of the Sorcerer's Guild. It appears that as you gain experience, your various guilds promote you and give you new advantages (the Sorcerer's Guild gives spells, for instance).I've won maybe eight combats in the arena (where I am a gladiator). These winnings entitled me to credits at a local gym, where I find that working out buffed up my statistics considerably. I went from 15 strength to 18 after a few turns on the weight machine. I'm guessing that the Collegium Magii (which I have not yet enrolled in) does something similar for intelligence and power.Slightly higher prices than Planet Fitness.As I said, I've died twice. Once was in the arena, when I faced Tyron the Apprentice Ninja. I was confused when I couldn't see my opponent at first. It dawned on me that he's a ninja  just as he disemboweled me.You don't see ninjas until they want you to see them.That freaking ghost continued to chase me around town for ages, immune to melee attacks, immune to magic missile. It wasn't until I got firebolt from the Sorcerer's Guild that I was finally able to kill the bastard.I won a fair amount of money at the casino. The slots advantage the house as bad as in Vegas, but roulette seems to offer roughly even odds.The roulette wheel is obviously a reference to The Pickup Artist.I found a brothel in town and paid a few hundred gold for the night. It wasn't really worth it.\"Honey, I swear! It was just 'educational'!\"I took a break from the Goblin Caves to go find the Archdruid. It was a bit anticlimactic. He lives in a forest hut surrounded by priests, angels, and demons, and the only thing he did for me was to offer a \"ritual of neutralization\" that recovered my alignment from chaos. Returning to Rampart, the Oracle now tells me to check out the Goblin Caves. Great! I was already on that.Finding the ArchDruid's hut in the forest. You get hungry absurdly fast in the game. To make it here and back, I had to carry 25 buckets of fried lizard parts (from Chronicles of Amber?).I'm developing a reasonably good inventory. A cutlass +2 for my primary weapon, a blessed round shield +2 and blessed soft leather armor +5. I got some boots of agility and a \"ring of brass and glass +4\" whose purpose is actually slightly confusing to me.I thought the moon's phase as \"gibbous\" must be another fantasy reference, but it turns out that's a real word, meaning between half and fully illuminated. Another thing I learned from CRPGs.For his inspiration to write the game, Mr. Brothers credits the \"obvious\" realization that Rogue-like gameplay \"could be expanded out of its one simple dungeon to...a larger world.\" However, he says that the real reason was \"mainly to avoid working on a Ph.D., which I in fact never got, so it was a successful project from that point of view.\" Ironically, I am blogging about Omega to avoid working on a Ph.D., but Mr. Brothers consoles me that \"you can stay ABD forever if the chairman likes you.\" I guess I'd better stop playing so many games or start sucking up."}, {"title": "Omega: Succumbed to Cheating", "date": "Wednesday, May 25, 2011", "text": "The game is not insulting me. My character's name was \"Bozo.\"Shortly after I began this blog, it took a turn that I didn't expect, and didn't even really notice at the time: I began playing a lot of independent CRPGs. About one-third of the games in my blog (if you count the \"backtracking\" postings from last July) were developed as what we would now call \"shareware.\"Independent games tend to lack the bells and whistles of commercially-developed CRPGs, but they often have more intriguing gameplay, as we find with NetHack, and certainly a much greater challenge. But here's the essential \"problem\" with them, coming from the perspective of someone who has in front of him a task to play thousands of games and is only at Game 56: commercial game publishers have to worry about the market, and so they tend to avoid releasing games that are @#!@%&ing impossible. With independent games, on the other hand, you are often at the mercy of a single soulless, basement-dwelling sociopath. I'm not saying that Laurence Brothers is such a person, but I'm frankly beginning to suspect that he at least was.[Later edit: the day after this was published, Rampant Coyote did a great job turning my snarky comment into a thoughtful posting on his blog.]There's so much great stuff in this game that it deserves multiple postings on this blog, but I'm never going to get to them because I can't live long enough. Omega would be pretty bloody hard without permanent death. With it...it's untenable for me to keep playing without cheating.\"Cheating\" in this context--in any context, really--is when you subvert the intentions of the game designer in order to reduce the intended difficulty of the game. I can say it's not fair, but Mr. Brothers intended this game to be very hard; if he hadn't, he wouldn't have written the game to delete the save file after you load it.So: I'm going to keep playing, but I'm going to allow myself to backup the save game file once per map (dungeon level, town, etc.). I can only restore and reload if I die, not if I just don't like the outcome of equipping a particular item or drinking a particular potion. With this limited cheating in place, I hope I can get further in the game and uncover some of its mysteries.Sitting in a class today, I idly wrote a series of Excel formulas to automatically generate a random sequence of letters for my character name (I don't know any actual programming). The result is \"Kibfizma.\" Kibfizma is going to tend towards the side of chaos. The first thing I had her do, after arriving in town, was break into a house. It turned out to be occupied by a ghost who...well, you need to see it:Ghosts are scary. Clowns are scary. The ghost of a clown is terrifying.Yep. It's the ghost of my most recent adventurer. The ghost and a separate haunt attacked me, and the game said I was too terrified to fight, so I went screaming back out onto the street.Seeking to redeem my inauspicious start, I bashed down the door to a mansion across the street, set off an alarm, was taken to jail, and got probation.Rampart is controlled by liberals.Okay. Something new. Next door to the jail was the arena, so I signed up as a gladiator and got a wooden sword and shield and a 5000 gold piece credit at the gym. I entered a match, killed Ebeneezer the Goblin, and won 100 gold.The paladins called me a \"minion of chaos\" and told me to get lost, and the castle said I wasn't famous enough to visit the duke. At the casino, I lost two rounds and won one, leaving with about 100 gold more than I started with. Found a pawn shop but couldn't really afford anything good. Found a place that sells and rents apartments for when I have more money. Bought 20 buckets of fried lizard for the road.One of several guilds to join in the game.I tried to join the mercenary guild, but it appears that they don't want me since I'm a gladiator. This confirms my previous experience that membership in certain guilds bars you from others. Damn. I didn't want to be a gladiator that badly, but I'll play it out and see where it goes. It looks like the Circle of Sorcerers might have me, but I need to raise 1,800 gold first. Similarly, the Collegium Magii wants 1,000 gold for enrollment.I wandered into a temple and became a \"lay devotee\" after praying at a statue of the Lords of Destiny. Bought some ring mail at Julie's. The town is so big that it would be hard to remember where the various stores are, but there's a neat (M)ove command that allows you to return to any facility that you've visited.Near the temple, I tried a closed door and discovered the Thieves' Guild! That's more like it. I waited a couple of hours until nightfall, when they were open, but didn't have enough gold to join. I went back to the arena, won two more battles, and then joined the guild, for which I got a lockpick and the spell Object Detection.By this time, I had gained enough levels to visit the palace and get the quest to kill the Goblin King from the duke. I'm being chased around town by a ghost that I picked up in the cemetery. Every time I get close to it, it \"terrorizes\" me and renders me incapable of attacking until I flee for a few squares. Leaving town and coming back doesn't help. I tried to avoid him to get to the Oracle (who again suggested that I visit the ArchDruid) but I found the ghost blocking the path back. I had to cut my way through a hedge to evade him, which poisoned me. The poison nearly killed me, but it wore off just as I was on my last hit point.I left town and I'm now attempting the goblin caves again. I've risen to Level 4, which is a \"peregrinator.\" I figured this had something to do with a falcon, but I looked up the word, and it turns out \"peregrinate\" is simply a synonym for \"migrate\" or \"wander.\" A \"peregrine falcon\" is named because it migrates over a wide territory. So chalk up another one to \"what have you learned?\"All right. Sorry to go into such detail about the town, but it's a good illustration of how much variety is in this game. Here are a few miscellaneous points and questions:What the heck is \"grot\"? I keep finding it, but if I use it it doesn't seem to do anything.Occam's razor: I'm probably just picking up piles of garbage.The game has a \"(T)unnel\" command that lets you carve holes in dungeon walls. Sometimes you do this to avoid something blocking a passage, sometimes to get to some treasure, and sometimes just to make a shortcut. Tunneling creates rubble, and there's a chance you'll get injured or stuck for a few turns when you try to cross it.Among the many commands I've yet to try in the game: cast a spell, pick someone's pocket, \"vault over a few intervening spaces,\" rename an item, set a combat \"action sequence,\" or hunt for food. This game is very NetHackian in the complexity of its uses of commands and uses of objects with each other.You can eat corpses in the game--I just ate a goblin--but it doesn't seem to have much of an effect. It didn't even cure my hunger. The next time I found a corpse, I picked it up and tried to throw it at my next enemy, but the game said that the goblin \"didn't accept my gift\"--I guess if you hurl a non-weapon at a foe, the game treats it like you're trying to give him something. Interesting. I wonder what uses it has.The game is full of references to other media, half of which I'm probably not getting. Here's one that I do know, even though I dislike this show for purely irrational reasons that I'll discuss when I get to BattleTech (there's a connection):Now, here's some exciting news: One of my readers, Eugene, gave me the current e-mail address for Laurence Brothers, and Mr. Brothers has been kind enough to share some of his recollections about the development process. (He didn't know I was about to refer to him as a \"basement-dwelling sociopath.\") I've never interviewed a CRPG developer before, so I'm probably asking all the wrong questions, but assuming he's okay with my publishing his quotes to the world, I'll have some more information for you tomorrow."}, {"title": "Paladin: Two Quests Down (with Final Rating)", "date": "Tuesday, May 24, 2011", "text": "The adventurers find an armory. That's a secret door below the active character.\u00a0\u00a0Paladin United StatesOmnitrend Software (developer and publisher)Released 1988 for Amiga, Atari ST, and DOS\u00a0Date Started: 22 May 2011Date Ended: 24 May 2011Total Hours: 6Difficulty: Moderate (3.0/5) Final Rating: 21Ranking at Time of Posting: 7/56 (13%)Ranking at Game #453: 162/453 (36%)Determined to get at least one quest finished before I called it quits on Paladin, I kept assailing the house and finally won. In doing so, I learned a little bit more about the game's tactics, although I still maintain that they're not significant enough to hold my interest.The most difficult aspect of the game is that if one fighter (either one of yours or an enemy) faces the other with his full movement strength, he can almost always slay that enemy during the round. Full movement grants between 8 and 10 swings, and it only takes 3 hits to kill most foes (including your characters). Thus, if you are unlucky enough to end the combat round with the enemy right in front of you, you will almost certainly die.This leads to a little bit of tactical maneuvering, in which you try to get your enemy to come to you. If they refuse to budge, you have to assemble your party at a staging point (for instance, just outside the door to a room), and then charge when you're sure you have enough movement points to reach the enemy and engage him in the same round--or when you know you can blast him from afar with bolts or fireballs.Assembling outside a door before charging a room.Fireballs, incidentally, turn everything in a 3 x 3 square to rubble, so you have to be careful using them around objects that you might want to pick up. I lost the quest once when I cast it too near a quest item and destroyed it.A room blasted by a fireball.I won the scenario on perhaps my sixth attempt, mostly by exercising more tactical caution. The goal again was to find the deed and the land grant for the house. One scroll was in the sub-basement, and the other was naturally in the attic. To get them, I had to slay rival fortune hunters and several ghosts.A ghost keeping me from the deed.Exiting the level involves marching back to the \"exit pentagram\" and ending the turn:At this point, the game gave me a simple message that \"you have completed the quest\" and told me that my paladin's accuracy had improved:The quest is then over, and the game saves my improved paladin file for use in another scenario. This is the only thing that really qualifies Paladin as a quasi-CRPG.Knowing this entry wouldn't be long enough at this point, I started another scenario, called \"Trojan Hoax,\" and was put in charge of two swordsmen, two mages, a ranger, and a thief.The paladin is the only character that you get to name. Apparently, I have a significantly handicapped thief.The quest in this scenario sounds a bit dumb, but here it is:I stormed the castle (not a good tactic) and found a the entryway full of guards who slaughtered half my party in about two rounds.A mage and a swordsman stood where this rubble is now.The entry hall was a dead end, but I found a teleportation pentagram that took me outside the tower, where my party was attacked by dragons.The dragons fell surprisingly easily given that they were dragons. Making my way around the tower the long way, I finally made it to the tower's upper levels, where I found the princess surrounded by monster guards:I managed to kill them, losing all but my paladin himself in the process, but then I ran afoul of the game's extremely short time limit for this quest.The second time around, with some foreknowledge of the layout, I was able to rescue my beloved and once again given the game's wonderfully rewarding quest completion message:I got another message that my accuracy increased.I admit that I found the game slightly more enjoyable today than when I first posted about it, but not enough to complete a bunch more missions. The game would be more interesting if the quests were unified under some kind of general theme. Fractured as they are, playable in just about any order, some of them not particularly chivalrous...Ah, a noble quest for wealth and power....the game doesn't have a very good overall game world (1). Compare this to Sorcerian, which had the same sort of quest-based structure but tied it together with a kingdom and town that you visited between quests. Paladin doesn't even tell you the name of the world in which you're operating.If the game didn't allow some basic character development, it wouldn't have any CRPG credentials at all, but it's very basic character development. When creating the character, the only option you have is the paladin's name, and the attribute increases you receive at the ends of quests are determined by the game, not anything you decide (2). There are scattered NPCs, usually there to greet you at the beginning, but they tell you nothing interesting and you have no dialog options (1).Good one.There are a handful of monsters that the game uses over and over, not even bothering to tell you their names, and no way to role-play encounters, although the monsters do act differently depending on type (2). Combat is tactical, which is the purpose of the game, but you have fewer options than in most real RPGs and the selection of magic spells is paltry (4).There are some scattered bits of equipment--potions and missile weapons, mostly--around the levels, but in general you don't get to upgrade your weapons and armor, and the game barely meets my rule or CRPG minimums here (1). There is no economy at all (0). The game has no main quest; it's composed of various limited-duration side quests that have varying levels of interest and difficulty, but only one outcome (3). The graphics and sound  are reasonable enough, but whether you use the mouse or keyboard, the controls are horrible (3). Finally, the gameplay within each quest is very linear, but the quests have the virtue of brevity and the overall difficulty is balanced well for a strategy game (4).The final score of 21 puts it on the lower tier of games, but of course I'm rating it as a CRPG, not as a strategy game, which is closer to its correct category.I have to figure out what I'm doing with Omega before moving on to Pool of Radiance.

The world seems to be torn between the forces of law and chaos, each with its pantheon of deities. The Gods of Law include Odin and Athena, and the Gods of Chaos are Set and Hecate. Nice blending of mythologies there. There are also Druids, who seek to maintain a balance and some mysterious beings called Lords of Destiny, who arbitrate between the two forces.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 There was a \"mysterious document\" in the library, heavily annotated by the librarian, which suggested something about the main quest: basically, character improvement to the level of Adepthood. It ended with the statement that \"the final test of an Adept is Mastery of that Void which lies both within and without the self\" and that \"only an Adept can become a Total Winner.\"Determined to fully explore Rampart before setting out and dying again, I found a few places I had overlooked in my previous games (some of the city is randomized with each new character, too). Among my deeds:Slew two haunts in the cemetery and rose a couple of levelsTried to bash a statue that was in my way and had it turn into a \"catoblepas,\" which I killed and then salvaged its eyes.You didn't think it was a real word either, did you?Explored a hedge maze, killed several monsters, found several treasures, and found the entrance to a sewer (didn't go down just yet).Found the Oracle in the center of the hedge maze. All she told me was \"The ArchDruid speaks wisdom in his forest shrine.\" The Oracle's mirror also tells you your alignment; it gave mine as on the \"chaos\" side of \"neutral,\" which surprised me. I wonder if attacking creatures that weren't attacking me is to blame.Visited a tavern when it opened (hours, days, and months pass in the game) and spent 100 gold on a round for the house.Grateful NPCs.Spent 900 gold on a partial suit of plate armor.Got refused by the Mercenary Legion because of my paladin membership.Joined the \"Explorer's Club\" and was taught a spell that would automatically teleport me in dungeons.By this time, I had gained enough levels that the Duke granted me an audience and gave me a quest to bring him the head of the Goblin King. The manual says that the Goblin King's lair is due south of Rampart but I'll have to search for it. I found it almost immediately, about three squares south of the city. The game forced me to let my horse go free, unfortunately.The Goblin Caves turned out to be large and multi-leveled, and as I sign off for the day, I'm in the middle of them. I'm very worried about survival. Permanent death is one thing in a game like Rogue, where nothing much changes from one game to another, and the point is not to \"win\" the game so much as see how close you can come. It's another thing in this game, which is more like a traditional CRPG. Imagine if every time your character died in Baldur's Gate or Morrowind, you had to start completely over from the beginning.Tomorrow, I'll let you know if the episode left me victorious, or howling at the walls in frustration. It's a roguelike, so do you want to lay odds?"}, {"title": "Game 56: Paladin (1988)", "date": "Sunday, May 22, 2011", "text": "Note: I'm not done with Omega, but I needed a break from the game's ruthlessness, so I thought I'd explore another game. I wish I hadn't.To me, certain computer game genres age better than others. I think CRPGs age very well, which is really the entire point of my blog. The stories, gameplay, and challenges found in titles like Ultima IV and Might & Magic rival or exceed most current releases. Adventure games, too, can provide delight well past their shelf lives because of the richness of their plots and the challenge of their puzzles. Anyone who eschews Zork or King's Quest just because they're \"old\" is as characterless as someone who refuses to watch Casablanca or listen to Benny Goodman for the same reasons.But it's also true that other genres struggle to find relevance with age. First-person shooters are a good example. Doom was groundbreaking for its time, but it's hard for me to imagine finding a lot of fun in it now, with other shooters on the market that offer the same basic experience but with better graphics, sound, and controls, and the ability to look up and down. [Later edit based on comments: Oh, for #$*%s sake, people. Fine. Doom is the greatest game ever made. All hail the glory of Doom.] I imagine simulation games suffer some of the same problems, when each new release offers even more realistic simulation. I don't play many simulation games, so I could be wrong, but would anyone really enjoy the first version of Microsoft Flight Simulator today, knowing that a more recent version would offer a more realistic experience, more aircraft, more locations, hardware acceleration, and so on?Even within the basic genres, certain sub-genres age better than others. When I was playing Sorcerian, I noted that action RPGs tend to age worse than regular RPGs, simply because action RPGs are more \"about\" graphics and animation.Strategy games fall somewhere in the middle. Strategy games are fundamentally about variables, and if you really like strategy games, you enjoy weighing the probabilities associated with power, movement, and resources--just like a real war theater. The best strategy games are those that give the most useful and interesting variables, and this isn't necessarily dependent on age. I remember playing a Civil War strategy game when I was a kid that would have given Einstein a migraine. It took me months to figure out what I was doing, but once I had a handle on it, the game was a joy. Graphics are secondary in strategy games; some great ones (Reach for the Stars,  Roadwar) barely have any graphics. I thought Warlords took a significant step backwards between III and IV because the latter jettisoned many of the strategic variables in favor of better graphics and animation. Did any Warlords fan really want that?This brings me to Paladin, which is a strategy game without a lot of variables, which means that it didn't age very well. The game is a quasi-CRPG, and I admit that it satisfies all three of the core criteria that I establish in Rule #1. But I find it so little fun that I'm almost moved to spend the rest of my six-hour minimum staring at the opening screen rather than actually playing it.Paladin has the least intuitive controls, of any game I've played so far. The game follows the opening screen above with a partially-rendered screen that makes it look like the game has frozen. No amount of clicking or typing seems to help. Only by a careful reading of the manual do you determine that the function keys are the way to control the game, and only by a more careful reading do you realize that the process of creating a new paladin involves opening up a different program and using more arcane function commands.You control a party of characters moving through one of several scenarios or \"quests,\" each with a different set of objectives. Only your paladin, the leader, can move from quest to quest, and as he does, his statistics improve. Each quest is made up of turns alternating between your characters and enemies, much like in Warlords, Heroes of Might & Magic, or any number of similar strategy games.10 quests come with the basic game, but the publisher, Omnitrend, released Paladin Quest Disk: The Scrolls of Talmouth later the same year. The game also came with a construction set, and the version of the game that I downloaded contains several files that I can only imagine were constructed by fans.The first quest I tried was called \"House\" and the game put my paladin (Drust) in charge of a swordsman and two mages. The quest instructions told me the back story:A holy quest for real estate!The \"victory conditions\" tell me that I have to find the scrolls and get off the combat map within an hour (all quests are timed).During your turn, each character can move, attack an enemy, pick up an object, use an object, unlock a door, or cast a spell. Total actions and movement are limited by \"movement points.\" In many ways, playing the game is like being perpetually on the combat screen in Demon's Winter or the D&D \"Gold Box\" games (which, incidentally, Paladin is keeping me from), except that I think you have fewer options in Paladin. You certainly have fewer spells: rangers can cast confuse, speed, invisibility, and detect door, and mages can cast those plus fireball and mind stun.Targeting an enemy in a basement.The biggest problem with the game is that without the ability to move diagonally, it takes forever to get around the game map, especially when you're walking through corridors and your characters can't get past each other. I also lost patience when the game decided that the SHIFT key was being held down permanently, and every time I tried to move to the next character (N key), it insisted on ending the turn (SHIFT-N).Three characters trying to pile through a doorway.I made three assails against the house, and did find one of the scrolls one time, but you lose the game if your paladin dies, and that kept happening to me.Sigh. I suppose I can't leave this game until I win at least one of the quests, but I promise you, this game is tedious and boring. Don't look for a lot of postings here."}, {"title": "Game 55: Omega (1988)", "date": "Saturday, May 21, 2011", "text": "OmegaUnited StatesIndependently developed and published as freewareFirst version released in 1988 for DOS; continually updated to 2010Date Started: 21 May 2011 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Within about 10 minutes, Omega went from being a game that I was going to blow through to get to Pool of Radiance to a serious contender for the most intriguing discovery since I started this blog.This quasi-roguelike was written by Laurence Brothers, apparently while he was at the Rutgers University Department of Computer Science (that's where he wants me to send his check). It's \"roguelike\" in its basic appearance, with ASCII symbols representing the game world and its denizens, its use of upper- and lower-case keyboard commands, and its permanent death. It isn't a roguelike in its complexity. This is a game with multiple dungeons and villages, quests, guilds, shops, locked and unlocked doors, alignments, dialog with NPCs, houses you can burglarize, and a ton of other features I've barely scratched.Exploring a small village and talking to a guard.Where the game really won me over was the option, at the beginning, to create a character or \"play yourself.\" This is the most original character creation process I've seen outside Ultima IV. The game proceeds to ask how many pounds you can bench press, what you got on an IQ test, what percentile you scored on graduate and undergraduate entrance exams, whether you have training in martial arts or play a field sport, whether you can dance, what your other hobbies are, whether you're \"accident prone,\" whether you \"play video games\" and, if so, whether you get high scores, whether you can cut a card deck with one hand, whether you get sick frequently, whether you smoke or have high blood pressure, and a host of other questions. My favorites were: \"Do animals react oddly to your presence?\" and \"Do you have ESP?\" The game also wanted to know, for some mysterious reason, whether I'm Irish.After you answer, the game has you sucked into your computer a la Tron:I don't want to reveal too much about myself, but suffice to say I got an intelligence of 15, a constitution of 14, strength and dexterity of 11, agility of 10 (I shouldn't have said I was \"accident-prone\"), and virtually no magic power--this is the first CRPG to punish me for being an atheist. Statistics matter, as I soon found out with another character:Ouch.If I had known that my first character would last only minutes, I wouldn't have spent so much time creating him, though. The game is mercilessly lethal. Within the first few hours, my handful of hapless adventurers had died by trying to crawl through a hedge, drowning while crossing a small pond, accidentally attacking a guard, rupturing a hernia while trying to lift a portcullis, starving, getting blasted by a priest the moment he walked into an abandoned temple, falling from a mountain, getting brained by a \"ricochet,\" and half a dozen other ways. Half of the time, I'm not quite sure why I just died.What is that supposed to mean?The game starts in the City of Rampart, a large town with an arena, a jail, a palace (I am told to return when I am famous), several guilds, a library, an apartment building, a casino, a Colosseum, restaurants, shops, a Department of Public Works (where you can \"go on the dole\" if you're poor enough), a bank, a cemetery, mansions to burglarize if you feel like it, a poorhouse where you can donate gold, and lots of other buildings I haven't explored.Orgullous joins a mercenary legion.My first character, Orgullous, joined a mercenary guild and got a short sword and some leather armor; entered a match at the Colosseum and defeated \"Federico the pencil-necked geek,\" winning 50 gold; bought a suit of chain mail at a shop called Julie's; bought some fried chicken to take on the road (exploring the wilderness requires a lot of food), and got killed a few steps after he stepped outside by a storm.Fighting in the arena.My most successful adventurer, Cauthon, joined the order of paladins, who decided he was good after he donated some money to the orphanage. They gave him a spear and a horse to ride. He bought some armor at a shop, some food, and headed out. Within moments, he got stuck in a \"chaos storm,\" which had killed one of my previous characters, but Cauthon survived it. The game told me this was a \"learning experience\" and advanced Cauthon several levels. A weird voice on the wind said, \"The Eater of Magic can be found on an island.\" I wandered east, having to eat every few steps, and then suddenly, in a forest, something cast a spell that caused me to go blind and I was killed by a brigand.Outdoor combat on the \"tactical map.\"Aside from the overall peril, the most difficult part of the game is the inventory, which is divided between stuff you can carry or wear and your pack. Transferring stuff around is a bit cumbersome. When you first pick up an object, it is \"up in the air,\" and you can determine whether to put it into your pack or equip it somehow. If you put it in the pack and later want to use it, you have to first take it from the pack, after which it returns to \"up in the air,\" and then put it in your \"ready hand.\" This translates to about eight keyboard commands just to eat a piece of chicken.The second difficulty is that I really have no idea what to do. In my explorations of the outdoor area, I've encountered a couple of villages and a temple, but no hints as to the main quest or even side quests. The game documentation says that there are a number of ways to \"win\" and that consulting the oracle is a key to one of them, but I haven't found the oracle yet. Hints (but light hints) from anyone who's played the game would be welcome, 'cause I'm getting slaughtered here.Still, I want to fully explore this one. I realize that the later versions of NetHack transcend what is normally thought of as the limitations of a \"roguelike,\" but this is the first game that has really made me feel it's possible to create a full and interesting world without anything we'd think of as \"graphics.\"My new character, Steevil, is created, and I'm going to try to make it alive long enough to explore the Goblin Caves the manual insists are just south of the starting city."}, {"title": "Game 54: Moraff's Revenge (1988)", "date": "Friday, May 20, 2011", "text": "From the last 50 games, I have determined that there is no correlation between the quality of the game and the elaborateness of the first screen.

Right now, I guess you can still buy games that were issued in 2002, but by the time I get to 2002, it'll probably be 2018, and those games will be long out of circulation. I figured I'd always be scouring for abandonware or depending on sites like Gog.com.Well, I'm pleased to admit I'm wrong: Moraff's Revenge, an independent 1988 game, is still being sold for $10 by the author, Steve Moraff. I tried to buy it, but it looked like the only option was to buy it on CD, not to download it. Given my travel schedule over the next few months, I don't have any idea where to ship the thing that will ensure that I actually get my hands on it. Right now I've got a free shareware version that only goes up to Level 17; the $10 version goes to Level 70. [Ed.: Within a few years, the site had stopped offering this game for sale.]Exploring Moraff's dungeon.Whether I care to go even to Level 17 (or 7, for that matter) remains undecided. The game is a passable dungeon crawl with some original elements, which I will cover anon, but not much in the way of plot, story, NPCs, or anything to break up the overall monotony. The introduction is actually straightforward about this:This is a role playing game...Each time you kill a monster, you will obtain experience. When you have enough experience, you will get more power. The more experience you get, the more powerful you become.The game freezes you on this screen for about a minute, refusing to let you progress until it's convinced you've read everything (it does this with every text screen, actually), so I had lots of time to contemplate. This really is the quintessential definition of a \"role playing game,\" isn't it? An endless cycle of killing and leveling. What does it all mean? Why have I locked myself into it? Perhaps I should give up this playing and blogging nonsense and go teach...Oh, good! It's letting me into the game!A pop-up ad for the next game in the series, which I can't dismiss until \"Please read this\" turns into \"Hit any key.\" This sounds like a pretty cool game, but...God almighty, $195?!Character creation is a simple process of choosing a race and then rolling random sets of standard D&D statistics (strength, intelligence, wisdom, health, and agility) until you get the numbers you want. Unique in the game is the \"laziness\" statistic, which, according to the game's help file, \"wastes some of the limited points that could be part of other important characteristics and serves no purpose whatsoever.\" I think I like this guy's sense of humor.You then choose between fighter and wizard classes (I went with the game's suggestion to make the first character a fighter) and give yourself a name.If you reversed the order of these statistics, it would be a perfect real-life set of attributes for The CRPG addict.Starting in the town, with the dungeon gaping below me, I find myself wanting to know a little bit more about the game's back story and main quest, so I bring up the help file and ask for the \"Objectives.\" It begins helpfully, \"Like life itself, this game has no single simple object.\" Damn, this game is philosophical.Life actually has three objectives: vodka, girls, and jazz.Read deep enough into the narrative, though, and you find that, \"the most exciting goal is to find the fountain of youth on the 70th level,\" so I'm going to regard this as the \"main quest.\" I'm a little wary of the game's statement that reaching it \"may take months of play,\" but reassured that, \"if you are very clever, you will find a way.\" The CRPG Addict is very clever.I'm making a lot of fun of the text--which Mr. Moraff probably intended, frankly--but let's talk about what's good about this game, because there's plenty. First is the rather original mapping and exploration system (\"the mapping system of the game is perhaps its greatest feature,\" the manual crows). On the left of the screen, you see a bird's-eye map that slowly fills in its passages and rooms as you explore, saving your progress with your game. This is rare in CRPGs of the era (I think only Might & Magic II and Phantasie have functioning automaps so far) and almost unheard of in an independent game.Tooling about town.On the right side of the screen is a not-quite 3D view of what your character sees in front of him. Rather than actually rendering a 3D wire-frame view like the Ultima series, it instead shows four \"panels\" representing what you see in four directions. I actually find it much easier to navigate on the bird's-eye map, although you can only see enemies on the right-hand map.There are a number of other original features in the game:You gain experience when you kill monsters in the dungeon, but you have to rest at an inn to \"absorb experience\" and thus gain levels. There are three inns in town, and they vary in quality and price. The higher-priced ones restore more hit points and grant more experience when you rest there. The cheapest one (\"The Fleabag Motel\") carries a risk of disease and theft.The primary currency of the game is \"jewel pieces\" (JP). In the dungeon, you find coins of various denominations, but you have to bring them to the bank and convert them to JPs in order to use them. There's a bit of strategy associated with picking up money from slain foes. You have a max carrying weight, and if you waste it all picking up copper pieces, you won't be able to take gold or platinum from the next combat (the game allows you to abandon all your coins, but not to swap cheap coins for the good stuff).At the temple, where you can go for healing, you have the option to pay 500,000 JPs for an extra level. The game thus satisfies my rule that there ought to always be some reason to collect money.Only 499,980 to go!In an echo of Rogue, you sometimes find pills and wands in various colors. The only way to figure out what they do is to use them. The colors remain consistent across items that do the same thing. If the blue pill heals, all blue pills will heal.The game makes a cute use of music. When you check into the inn, it plays \"Rock-a-Bye Baby,\" and when you visit the temple, it plays \"When the Saints Go Marching In.\" Upon death, it naturally plays Chopin's funeral march.The game occasionally throws hints at you, like \"Go to the bank to cash in treasure\" (when you're reaching your max carrying weight) and \"You should stay at an inn\" (when you have enough experience to level).While these features are fun, the basic gameplay is somewhat boring. Combat consists of repeatedly hitting your foe with your chosen weapon until one of you dies. There are a handful of spells for wizard characters, who face a tough beginning, as they cannot wield anything but knives or wear anything other than armor; at higher levels, they are apparently much better than fighters. Inventory is similarly banal: you can carry knives, swords, and maces, and wear one of four types of armor; if you find or buy better items, they automatically replace what you're already wearing or wielding.Shopping. Does the distinction between \"plate armor\" and \"field plate armor\" come from Dungeons & Dragons?Monsters are relatively unmemorable. In my gameplay so far, I've fought vampire bats, centipedes, skeletons, hobgoblins, zombies, half-orcs, armored fighters, flying stirges, flesh eaters, gnolls, trolls, giant ants, and giant ticks. Foes have levels, too; a Level 1 half-orc might die in one hit, but a Level 8 half-orc will kill lower-level characters just as quickly. Death, when it comes, is both permanent and insulting:This was before the \"LOL\" era.There is a chance of an adventurer finding your body and raising you, but if that happens your attributes suffer significantly, and it's generally best just to restart.In short, Moraff's Revenge is a  single-character, permanent-death dungeon crawl with limited tactics  and almost no story, but with some decent programming innovations. I'll finish up my six hours and see if it delivers anything more. I should note that many of you have been leaving positive comments about this game over the last few weeks, but judging by the contents of the comments, I think you're thinking of Moraff's World, which doesn't come up until 1991.Before I go, I have to ask: Since Moraff's Revenge is obviously named after the author, Steve Moraff, exactly who is he getting \"revenge\" on, and why? I can just see him in 1988: \"Smart kids at this university are screwing up the bell curve! I shall introduce this game to the servers and make them waste hundreds of hours of studying time trying to find a fountain of youth! Bwu-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!\"Later edit: The game didn't really offer anything new for the rest of my playing time. As I departed it, I read a review here, which notes that if you make it to the Fountain of Youth, \"drinking from it will basically start a new cycle of the game where your character goes back to level 1, but with better stats and stat growth than before, and a newly randomized dungeon to try [to] beat.\" That's not much of a reward. The review also notes favorable things about the two successive Moraff games, which are on my list."}, {"title": "Might & Magic II: Final Rating", "date": "Thursday, May 19, 2011", "text": "The results of attacking 65 Devil Kings. Each one has 5,000 hit points and is worth 30,000,000 experience points. I would wager that this battle is impossible even at the highest levels. I couldn't even kill one.Well, I really stretched that one out, didn't I? 53 days from the first post to \"Won!\" Of course, I wasn't playing during this entire stretch, but that's a long time even to have a single game on one's mind.Might & Magic I remains my highest-rated game so far, largely because of the variability in equipment, the strong economy, the variety of quests (it was the first game to feature real \"side quests\"), and the overall quality of gameplay. The gameplay in Might & Magic II is largely identical to MM1, but with a different plot and better graphics. (It would be a good idea to review my rating for that game before reading this.) Hence, I wouldn't expect the score to be a lot different. Let's see.1. Game world. The game benefits from a large world, many dungeons, varied terrain, and terrain-specific encounters. Its backstory is interesting, although the plots of the main villain are not well integrated into the game itself. I dock a point for basically repeating the first game's twist (the world is really a spaceship) and for featuring the same villain (but without providing much more information about him), but I have to add some points for doing a better job reacting to the player's actions: NPCs remember your deeds and react accordingly. The blend of sci-fi and fantasy remains unusual, and I still don't find it very convincing--see my questions at the end of yesterday's posting. Final score: 6.2. Character creation and development. The Cuisinart thing really bothered me. Most of the game, you're struggling for each experience point, and battles in which you net 50,000 or 75,000 experience are a real reward. Then, suddenly, you face a foe that earns you 7,500,000 experience, and sends you up several levels every time you fight him. It makes slogging through dungeons much less rewarding when you know you could just skip all that, pound the Cuisinarts a few times, and get the same result. The selection of races and classes are nothing special, but aside from the Cuisinarts, leveling is swift and satisfying. The class-specific quests are also a welcome touch, although the developers removed any role-playing based on alignment (as in the first game). Final score: 5.[Later edit: I realized I neglected to talk about the skill system here. It's a good step for the series, but it's not implemented very well. The reason I forgot about it is that you generally select your skills early in the gameplay and then never really think about them again. There is nonetheless some strategy associated with the choice of skills, and while it's not enough to advance the score, it's worth a mention.]3. NPC Interaction. Still the weakest part of the series. You encounter kings, lords, merchants, and other NPCs, but none of them offer dialog options or any real opportunity to role-play. Interaction is all one-way. Final score: 3.4. Encounters and foes. Andrew Schultz's walkthrough of the game lists an unsurprising total of 255 different monsters. They were extremely varied in their attacks and even more so in their resistances. Some are resistant to certain sexes, some to various types of magic, some to melee weapons. A good player needs to take careful notes or have a good memory. I wasn't a good player. I kept forgetting if it was the Cursed Corpse or the Coffin Creep that drains your magic, and whether it was the Iron Wizard or the Warbot that casts \"Eradicate.\" It doesn't help that many use the same icons. The game allows you to encounter up to 255 enemies at once, which is a lot more than the first game and provided a unique challenge in the beginning stages. In later stages, mass encounters were generally fodder for the CTRL-A combo, although going back to the Tundara dungeon and casting \"Holy Word\" on 200 Killer Cadavers was definitely a high point. There's a good balance between random encounters and fixed encounters, and rarely did it seem (unlike The Bard's Tale III) like there were too many encounters. Final score: 6.\"Revenge is a dish best served cold*.\"*This is funny because it takes place in the Tundara dungeon.5. Magic and Combat. I detailed the combat system in a posting in March an the magic system a couple of days ago. Since you only have to survive one combat at a time, it's not quite as tactical as Wizardry. I actually liked it better in the beginning stages, when every passage felt potentially dangerous, than in later stages when I was CTRL-A'ing my way through battles with demons. There are plenty of combat options, though, from different types of attacks to spells to uses of magic items. What I didn't like was the imbalance between outdoor combat (which became laughably easy towards the end, thanks to Moon Ray and Starburst), and indoor combat, in which you never get a mass healing spell. Final score: 5.6. Equipment. Largely unchanged from MM1, but still very good. You can equip six items and carry six others, and there are many, many types of items to find, some of which provide attribute increases, cast spells, provide resistance bonuses, or just do mad damage against your foes. There seemed to be no upper limit to the +s that a weapon or armor could achieve. I liked that even non-spellcasters could use magic items, turning my thief into an emperor of electrical destruction when I filled his pack with Storm Wands. The \"Specials\" at shops always provided a good selection, even at high levels. I also liked that items were mostly randomized within the game world, but there were some fixed item locations. One of the best CRPGs of the era when it comes to equipment, the game lacks only descriptions. Final score: 7.Quick rundown: the Stealth Cape, Thief's Pick, and Looter Knife increase thievery. The Sapphire Pin increases luck by 15. The (B)ronze Chain Mail boosts fear resistance (as well as armor class). The Storm Wands cast Lightning Bolt, the Flaming Sword and Fireball Bow cast Fireball, and the Freeze Wand casts Fantastic Freeze.7. Economy. Until I found the magic well in the Luxus Palace that converted gold to experience, I thought the economy was horribly imbalanced. It still is, really. Except during the first town, you almost never hurt for gold. The game could have done a better job with this, offering lower gold rewards and making things like NPCs, healing, and blessings cost more. As it was, the only time I worried about money was when a Leprechaun (nasty bastards) zapped it all away, but even then it only would take me 20 or 30 minutes to recover millions. The first game was a little tougher and more fun. Final score: 6.8. Quests. The Might & Magic series continues to shine here. It remains the only series in this era with a strong selection of side quests as well as a compelling, multi-stage main quest. The main quest was slow to reveal itself, just like in the first game, but it was one of the more interesting main quests of the CRPGs I've played, and it fit well with the game's back story. Every map featured a side quest or two, and the class-specific quests were a very nice addition. My only complaint is that many of the quests relied a little too much on notes scrawled on dungeon walls. Still, in my opinion, this is the best aspect of the game. Final score: 8.One of many side quests and special encounters.9. Graphics, Sound, and Inputs. The graphics are much improved over MM1. They are detailed, animated, and nice to look at. Nothing like modern games, but certainly not distractingly bad. Sound continues to consist of bloops and overly-repetitive victory music. The set of keyboard commands is probably the best of any game I've played: quick and intuitive. Final score: 5. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 10. Gameplay. Another way in which the series excels is its nonlinearity. In fact, one might say that the game is nonlinear to a fault: you have to explore extensively before you even realize what you're supposed to do in the game. Towards the end, the game started to feel a little easy, but most of the time it felt just right. As in the first game, a new selection of transportation spells deliver themselves every time you start to feel like exploration is a drag. I personally felt that it lasted a bit too long, but I think that had more to do with my erratic playing schedule than the fault of the game. The only serious drawback to gameplay is a lack of replayability. Final score: 7.The final score is 58. That's two points lower than I ranked Might & Magic I. If you want to howl in protest, believe me, I understand. From a purely objective standpoint, it seems like II should be better than I--if only for the graphics alone! But, to be perfectly honest, I enjoyed the first game a little bit more. I think the quests had a little more depth, the game was better balanced, and the plot was more original back then. It's still the second-highest ranked game in my blog, though, and I did have a lot of fun playing it.I spent some time tonight reading Schultz's walkthrough to see what I missed. In case anyone is interested:The different meals you can purchase in the tavern do a lot more than I gave them credit for. I knew that eating roast peasant and cream of kobold soup led to some encounters with angry relatives, but I didn't realize that other meals were necessary to get NPCs.Finishing the Gourmet's quest (you have to eat every item in every tavern) apparently clears your palate, and makes sure the aforementioned peasants and kobolds stop attacking you. I must have eaten again after I finished this quest because they were still attacking me at the end.I forgot to tip the bartenders at each tavern, and it's from the tavern tips that I would have learned when the circus is in town (Days 140-170, apparently; I ended the game at Day 93, so it would have been a long wait).Drinking in the bars provided attribute boosts. I never noticed.In some of the dungeons, there are places that boost your attributes by 10 points permanently. I didn't realize that you could keep returning to these locations and get more boosts. It seems like cheating.I completely ignored skill potions because I didn't understand what they did. Apparently, they increase your level and cause you to do a lot more damage and make it more likely that enemies will flee. You can use them multiple times to really pump yourself up. Whoops.The guardian pegasus's name was Meenu. Solving the quest would have netted me 100,000 gold. Hardly worth it.Killing the elemental lords wasn't necessary.Apparently, there really was no other way to get the Orb out of Dawn's Mist Bog. Schultz was aghast at it, too.The reward for completing the Dragon's Dominion (which I didn't) was an extra 1,000 hit points. Wow. Turned out I didn't need them, I guess.I think it's actually cool that there were some things I never found or finished. It's a sign of a complex game.I don't know what Moraff's Revenge is, but it's up next!"}, {"title": "Might & Magic II: Won!", "date": "Wednesday, May 18, 2011", "text": "\"One of the most accomplished game players around!\" You read it here, folks.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The ending of Might & Magic II raises all kinds of implications that we must discuss, but for now, suffice to say that I've saved CRON.Before I go into the specific endgame steps, I'll point out that thanks to a comment from Ziad, I picked up a final quest before the end of the game. It involved going to two previous centuries, killing the ancestors of Lord Haart, and retrieving artifacts from each of them. This was worth 250,000 experience. I had found clues on dungeon walls as to their locations. Neither was hard to kill.It takes guts to send someone back in time to kill your own ancestors.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As far as I can tell, this quest and giving King Kalohn the Orb are the only reasons to time travel. I tried going back to the first century to see if I could catch the elemental wars, and to the seventh century to see if I could see Kalohn defeat the elemental lords in the Dead Zone, but no luck.Thanks also to Ziad's hints, I know the Circus only appears late in the year, and I don't need the attribute boosts enough to wait around for it. I also declined to finish the dragon caves, mostly because I was on a roll and wanted to finish the game tonight.Now, on to my issue at Dawn's Mist Bog Cavern. The solution was so idiotic that I hate to write it. When I first hit upon this solution, I actually thought I was  cheating--exploiting the way the game deals with NPCs to avoid finding  the \"real\" solution. But, nope, it turns out this is, in fact, the  \"real\" solution.Ready? I had to give the Orb to an NPC, \"dismiss\" the NPC from the party, and go pick him up back in town. How much sense does that make? If my PCs couldn't get out of the cave with the Orb, how did the NPC manage to do it? At least MM2 isn't alone in this foolishness: in Baldur's Gate II, your NPCs always manage to find their way back to the Copper Coronet no matter how remote a place you ditch them.With the Orb in hand, I took Lord Peabody's time machine back to the 800s and returned to the location where King Kalohn fought the Mega Dragon. This time, my arrival actually did some good:Would it have been too much to show a cut scene of this \"epic battle\"?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Returning from the ninth century (\"returning\" simply involves resting until you get kicked back to your own time; I guess time travel is a temporary condition), I visited the Luxus Palace Royale and found King Kalohn on the throne instead of his daughter. Hell, for all I know, he doesn't even have a daughter in this timeline.But if he's king, then who sent me back in time?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Below I've pasted a video of the part of the endgame described above. It bogs down a bit in the middle because I got attacked by a horde of goblins. I tried to show some other features of gameplay, such as inventory and mapping, at the same time.Square Lake is just outside Middlegate. It was inaccessible until Queen Lamanda named me the \"chosen one.\" It's a very linear dungeon, greeting you with this sign upon entrance......and throwing a tough combat at you every 15 steps. I got through it without too much difficulty, although I had to flee combat a few times and raise dead characters five or six times. After about 15 combats, I made it to the final corridor. I was greeted by 66 devil kings, who \"bowed down\" to me as the \"chosen one.\" The game gave me the opportunity to attack them, I guess as a kind of last epic battle, but I declined.Devil kings also show up again in Might & Magic VI. They don't bow, though.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Beyond the devil kings was my old nemesis from MM1: Sheltem. He was surrounded by some other demons and devils, but he went down surprisingly quickly.Apparently, Sheltem had been up to some mischief, because beyond the battle was a computer monitor that informed me CRON was about to collide with a sun. I stopped this using the WAFE password that King Kalohn had given to me.But WAFE only got me into the computer. At that point, I read Sheltem's message and got one of the most unique end-game challenges I ever experienced:That's right: not only a cryptogram, but a timed cryptogram. I didn't even notice the \"timed\" part until it was too late. I was messing around taking notes for this entry, and by the time I got to trying to solve it, I only had three minutes left. Moreover, I had absolutely no idea what the thing was asking of me. How does a cryptogram have a single-word \"answer,\" and what \"code\" is it looking for?Ultimately, I figured it out: the game wanted me to spell \"Preamble\" using the cryptogram's own code. But to do that, I would have to crack the cryptogram first. I couldn't do it in three minutes and CRON was presumably destroyed just after I was.I reloaded and fought my way through Square Lake again, resolving to use the full 15 minutes. It turned out that I didn't need it. \"Preamble\" had put the preamble to the U.S. Constitution in my mind (for my non-U.S. readers, most U.S. high school students end up memorizing the preamble at some point), and I realized almost immediately that this was the preamble to the U.S. Constitution (\"We, the people of the United States of America, to form a more perfect union...\"), but with \"United States of America\" replaced by some other five character word (represented above as \"Gqlli\").So to render the word \"Preamble\" in code, I simply had to find the first letter of the third word (\"people,\" as in \"We, the people\"), the letter that corresponded with the third letter in \"perfect\", the second letter of \"We,\" and so on. Getting it right produced the screen at the top of this entry. I got enough experience to raise my characters to around 75, and the game let me continue playing. A return visit to Kalohn showed that the game world did acknowledge my victory.Okay, let's ponder the implications of what we've learned. CRON, like VARN in Might & Magic I, is actually a space ship. The winning screen says that I saved \"CRON and all of its VARNs,\" so the VARN (Vehicular Astropod Research Nacelle) must be a part of a CRON (Central Research Observational Nacelle). CRON had been created by the \"Ancients\" to populate a distant planet, and it looks like we've just arrived.What is the name of the planet? Well, it's contained in the cryptographic preamble above. \"Gqlli,\" based on the other letters, resolves to \"Terra.\" And Might & Magic III is subtitled \"The Isles of Terra.\" Pretty cool!But none of this makes sense. If the Ancients created CRON, then what is the relationship of the elementals to the Ancients? The game's backstory (covered in the first posting) isn't simply mythology: I've been to the elemental planes and battled the elemental lords. Did the Ancients create the elemental lords? Are the Ancients the elemental lords? \"Terra\" is the Latin word for \"Earth\"--am I supposed to have just witnessed the original population of Earth?Even more mysterious, the same elemental planes and lords show up in later Might & Magic games set on different worlds, but it's pretty clear to me that in this game, the elemental planes are part of CRON.Also: how, precisely, did I get from the VARN in MM1 to CRON? How do we explain things like magic and undeath in the context of science fiction? How did King Kalohn know the password to the computer in Square Lake? Was my time travel just limited to this CRON, or could I have traveled back to meet the Ancients? Who, precisely, are Corak and Sheltem? Are they Ancients?I'd see if any web sites answer these questions, but I don't want to see spoilers for later games (I played III-V so long ago I barely remember them). Feel free to discuss in the comments. In the meantime, I'll put my GIMLET together."}, {"title": "Might & Magic II: Magic", "date": "Tuesday, May 17, 2011", "text": "Uck. I'm never eating anything in a CRPG again.I'm going to do something a bit odd here. I'm in the last dungeon of the game (I actually got all the way to an end but got screwed up by a cryptogram, of all things), but I'm going to save the recap of what I did to get here for the \"Won!\" posting later. Instead, I want to take some time to review something I've only glossed over in previous postings: the game's extensive magic system.The Might & Magic series has one of the more detailed magic systems of this era. While it does not have as many spells as The Bard's Tale III, nor the same creativity in spellcasting as Dungeon Master or Ultima IV, nor the same tactical intensity as Wizardry, the game does strike a nice balance among all of these favorable attributes.The basic facts about the Might & Magic II spell system are these:There are 96 spells in the game--48 cleric spells and 48 sorcerer spells--organized into nine levels. Clerics and sorcerers gain one spell level for every two character levels; they have the full set by Level 17.Archers gain sorcerer spells starting at level 5, and paladins gain cleric spells starting at the same level. Both classes can only go to spell level 7.Some spells are awarded immediately upon achieving the spell level. Others have to be bought in temples or magic guilds, and still others must be found. Late in the game, I found a wizard who sold me all available spells for 2 million gold.Defeating the Mist Warrior nets you one of the most useful spells in the game.Each spellcaster has a number of spell points dependent upon his or her prime attribute: intelligence for sorcerers and archers, personality for clerics and paladins. There are fountains in the game that can temporarily raise the spell point maximum. Resting recovers all spell points.Some spells have a fixed cost; others have a spell point cost dependent on the character level (these typically do more damage).Some spells require only spell points; others require gems. Gems are plentiful throughout the game. If the game had made it more difficult to find them, it might have led to some more strategy as the player tries to conserve them, but I was never in danger of running out.Towards the end of the game, my sorcerer had a maximum of 440 spell points and had a comfortable 1,224 gems.Most monsters have some type of spell resistance or immunity. Some are immune to all spells.Some monsters drain your spell points. Phase Spirits and Coffin Creeps can drain all characters' spell points in a single attack. With Phase Spirits, this is particularly bad news because they cannot be hit by melee weapons and they are immune to most (all?) damage spells. I honestly don't know how you defeat Phase Spirits if you don't manage to kill them all in the first round.You find many objects in the game that take the place of spells. For instance, the Ray Gun, in addition to raising your accuracy, casts Energy Blast. A Witch's Broom casts Fly, and a Super Flare casts Lasting Light. All characters can use objects. I loaded up my robber with Storm Wands so he could cast Lightning Bolt round after round.The Lich's Hand casts spell 5-2: Finger of Death.96 spells is a lot to keep track of, and looking over my usage, I think that I could have gotten through the game with only 9 spells: the cleric spells of Power Cure, Moon Ray, Raise Dead, and Town Portal; and the sorcerer spells of Lloyd's Beacon, Fly, Lightning Bolt, Teleport, and Dancing Sword. These probably account for 80% of my spell usage. The rest fall into one of nine categories:1. Spells that cure conditions you rarely experience. These include Awaken, Cure Poison, Cure Disease, Restore Alignment, Uncurse Item, and Remove Condition. I think that during the game I was poisoned maybe once, I never suffered a disease, and I never came across a cursed item. My alignment never slipped. Remove Condition came in handy for a couple of paralysis fixes, but nothing beyond that. There's a spell called Shelter that supposedly prevents you from being attacked while you rest, but I was never once attacked while resting.2. Spells that never work. Top contenders are Apparition, Silence, Sleep, Web, Finger of Death, Feeble Mind, and (for me) Turn Undead. The failure rate on these is so high that it's hardly worth wasting a round to cast them.Finger of Death fails again.3. Spells that are useless after Level 3. The sorcerer spells of Flame Arrow, Electric Arrow, and Acid Spray, and the cleric spells First Aid, Cure Wounds, and Pain. These are useful in the beginning stages when you need to damage low-level creatures or heal a few hit points, but they soon fade to the back of your mind like cantrips you learned as an apprentice. Similarly, Location is only valuable until you have a character with the cartographer skill.4. Spells that make me suspicious of their effects. There are a host of spells that sound like they do good things, but that don't show any visible effects so you have to discern them from the amount of damage you do or take. I'm talking about Bless, Heroism, Shield, Weaken, Holy Bonus, and Invisibility. These sound like spells I should cast to gain a combat advantage, but I'd rather save my round for things that I know work.5. Spells that duplicate what the temples do for you. The protection level offered by Protection from Magic and Protection from Elements depends on the level of the caster. As I finished the game, I had only just reached the level in which my casting those spells gave me more protection than if I went to a temple and kept donating 100 gold until they cast the spell for me. The temple blessing also gets you Walk on Water, Guard Dog, Eagle Eye, Wizard Eye, Lasting Light, and Levitate. Since I always got a blessing before venturing out, I rarely had to cast these spells. (Wizard Eye, oddly, takes a ridiculous number of spell points--almost 1/3 of the characters' total.)Temple blessings give you the full complement of protection spells you see to the right.6. Spells that come with too high a cost or risk. Resurrection heals eradication but at a cost of 1 endurance point to the raised character, 5 years of age to the raised character, and 1 year of age to the caster. Better to take the character to a temple. Divine Intervention ages the caster 5 years. Rejuvenate backfires and ages the character as often as it works. Duplication, Recharge Item, and Enchant Item might end up destroying the item. None of them were worth the risk to me.7. Mystifying spells. This category deserves its own sub-bullet list, because I could never figure any of these out.Entrapment: \"Surrounds the battle with a magical energy field preventing all from escaping.\" The problem is that enemies don't try to escape unless they're ridiculously overmatched, in which case the experience reward you get from killing them is negligible.Prismatic Light: \"A powerful but erratic spell that has completely unpredictable effects.\" All this spell does is randomly choose some other group-effect spell to cast, like Sleep or Paralyze. Why would you cast Prismatic Light instead of just targeting them with a specific spell you know will work?Nature's Gate: A spell that just teleports you from one outside location to another one, seemingly at random. One level later, you have Fly and can go exactly where you want. I think it's only useful on the one day you can get the Starburst spell with it.Air/Earth/Fire/Water Transmutation. The spellbook suggests that you need to cast these spells to explore the elemental planes, but I never did and I was able to explore just fine.8. Spells that only work on one creature. At higher levels, targeting a single creature always seems to be a bad use of spell points. Most individual creatures that you're really keen to kill have spell resistances anyway. I never used any of the Encasement spells, for instance.9. Overpowered spells. I hardly ever used a large selection of higher-level damage spells: Fiery Flail, Mass Distortion, Implosion, Inferno, Star Burst, Mega Volts, Incinerate, and Meteor Shower. A lot of them only work outdoors, and by the time you're high enough level to get these spells, you can handle almost any outdoor enemy with melee attacks and castings of Moon Ray (simultaneously heals the party and damages enemies) every round. Others only work on a single creature, with the same problem as above. Sorcerers already have a spell called Energy Blast which scales with the level and seems to do almost as much damage (when it works). Mostly, it comes down to the lack of a need to be very tactical in combat (which I covered in a March posting); once you get a selection of spells and combat tactics that generally work, it doesn't pay to get creative.Meteor-showering some goblins just for fun.There are a handful of spells that are occasionally useful for specific purposes: Surface to get out of a dungeon; Create Food in case you forgot to buy some; Identify Monster to see how many hit points your foe has; Jump to get over a trap; Time Distortion to escape combat; Etherealize to get through a wall; Holy Word to kill all undead; and so on. If the nine spells listed above make up 80% of my casting, these addition spells account for another 15%. What do you think: is this common among CRPG players? I'll bet 75% of the wizard spells I cast in Baldur's Gate are Fireball, Magic Missile, and different levels of monster summoning. What I can't decide is if this is just laziness or if the games really are unbalanced towards certain spells.One thing is certain: Without the large selection of navigation spells, including Fly, Town Portal, and Lloyd's Beacon, gameplay in the later stages of Might & Magic II would be somewhat excruciating.One final note: the names of these spells, and their effects, remains unchanged throughout most of the Might & Magic series. Almost all of them appear in VI-VIII, although separated into categories. In those games, I found Starburst and Meteor Shower a lot more handy.We've been on this game long enough, wouldn't you say? Time for the winning posting."}, {"title": "Might & Magic II: Stuck in a Bog", "date": "Monday, May 16, 2011", "text": "A childhood dream fulfilled.Well, I was a little cocky last night. Not only am I not at the winning stage yet, I'm a bit flummoxed about how to get there. First, let's deal with the stuff I got right.On the elemental planes, I got a series of red messages. I already had the yellow messages. The interleaves were very complicated: I had to put the messages in a particular order, then take differing numbers of letters from each one before it all came together. The yellow messages finally spelled out:If personal statistics you'd like to enhance, with circus games you should take a chance. Win dumb prizes, but don't feel bad. You can offer these toys to an old man who can be had. His hut is in the wilderness dwarfed by a tree. For the toy, he gives you a tip for free. Drink from the inner limits pool. Though once it was acid, now it is cool. With thirst now thoroughly sated, go back to the circus and play games to raise those statistics which you truly hated.Very interesting, but as I covered yesterday, I can't seem to find the circus in session. Let's look at the red messages:To right ancient wrongs, the solution is very long. The Triple Crown must first be done, with Arena, Monster Bowl, and Colosseum to be won. Next, the party must split individually so that each may fulfill their personal destiny. Request an audience with the Queen so the Chosen One can be seen. Travel through time with Talons and Orb. Save the dead king from destruction and get the password. Then visit the lake geometrics to find the passage to that which you must hurriedly fix. JVC.Once again, JVC has a gift for the obvious. Obviously I needed to have figured out most of this to even get to the messages in the first place. Nonetheless, it does tell me something about what happens after I save Kalohn. I'm sure the \"lake geometrics\" refers to a dungeon near Middlegate that won't open for anyone save the \"chosen one.\"All right. Let's talk about Dawn's Mist Bog. This evening, I explored it from top to bottom, slaying legions of creatures and resurrecting my party members as they (frequently) died. I defeated some Lucky Dogs and rolled in Lucky Charms to get a permanent luck increase. I rescued two NPCs named Holy Moley (I'm immune to this by now) and Slick Pick. I defeated a party of 200 greedy snitches.At last, I assaulted Dawn herself, along with two enchantresses. She fell a little easier than I expected: her minions were much tougher than her.Nice outfit, though.The Orb turned out to be hidden behind a secret door. Approaching its chamber, I was met by a party of four Orb Guardians. The battle with them was apparently in an anti-magic zone, because none of my spells (including healing) would work. But they fell fairly quickly to my weapons.At last, the Orb was in my clutches! I took it from its pedestal and put it in my pack. Now, armed with this and the Talons, I can travel back in time, save Kalohn, and win the game! I triumphantly made my way to the exit, and:What the hell? Why would the Orb want to do that? Well, it doesn't matter, because I found that Dawn has a secret portal to Murray's Resort Isle. Clearly, I'm supposed to take that. I make my way over to it, only to get the same message as above. Okay...I'll just use my \"Town Portal\" spell. Nope, that failed. How about \"Lloyd's Beacon\"? Failed. \"Surface\"? Also failed.I wandered around Dawn's for an hour, trying to find an alternate exit, but I can't find anything. The only way it let me out was to drop the Orb. When I then went back in to try again (thinking maybe it was a game bug), I realized that snatching the Orb meant sacrificing my todilor, capitor, fluxor, and radicon, so now I have to go get those from their castles again. Aaargh!Well, at least Murray was happy with me:Now I'm scouring my notes to see what I was missing. Maybe I was supposed to pick up another clue somewhere. The only dungeons I haven't explored fully are the basement of the Luxus Palace Royale and the dragon caves. I guess I'd better go through them and see if there was an object or message that I needed.If this turns out to be something stupid, I'm going to be very angry. No spoilers! I need to figure this out myself. (If you want to leave a message for posterity in ROT-13, feel free.)"}, {"title": "Might & Magic II: On the Main Quest", "date": "Sunday, May 15, 2011", "text": "This is what happens when you try to jump steps in the main quest.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When I last wrote, I was about to visit Dawn's Mist Bog Cavern. But it looks like I can't get the Elemental Orb from her place yet anyway, so I retreated and started cleaning up other bits of the map and leftover dungeons. Here are a few final discoveries:I mentioned in an earlier post that there are \"message posts\" all over the world's surface that give you nonce strings of letters and punctuation. I've found two colors of messages: green and yellow--specifically 4 green signposts and 9 yellow ones. A clue in a dungeon told me how to interleave the characters on the green messages, and they produce the following:For each individual to become true, see the jury which resides at Mount Fairview. Travel in groups of appropriate class. A robber can aid all others with their task.Oh, dear. Leaving aside the abysmal meter, the substitution of assonance for real rhymes, and the poor grammar in the final sentence, the real problem with this message is I already knew this! Hell, all of my characters but one already have their promotions! MM1 did this to me, too. These messages are useless. I don't have the interleave code for the yellow yet (I hope I didn't miss it somewhere), and I can't figure it out just by looking at it, but I hope it tells me something better than this.One of my unsolved mysteries was on Map C3, where a voice kept asking  for a password. I later realized the password must be \"DRUIDS,\" since  letters on the rocks in the surrounding area spelled this word.  Sometimes I wonder how I ever finish a CRPG. Anyway, in the dungeon, aside from a bunch of traps, I found some cans of spinach that permanently increased my strength. I also solved a quest for the head druid, but all it got me was the Divine Intervention spell, which I already had.This is one password that ought to have special characters.In the dungeon of Castle Hillstone, I found a magic pool that, when I drank it, turned all my characters male--permanently. This is not good because there are some creatures that males can't damage. I was trying to figure out how to reverse this when the game solved it for me by having my party slaughtered by warbots (yes, hostile robots are among the monsters you face). When I returned, I didn't drink from the pool again, but I did find a magic well that accepted my gold in exchange for experience. There was one of these in MM1, too. I love this. Now I have an excuse to keep getting rich.It is hard to imagine real-life adventurers doing this.In a volcano named gemmaker, I found a lot of gems, and not a single combat.I finished the quests for Lord Slayer and Lord Wood. At the highest levels, Slayer wanted me to kill a bunch of monsters around the various maps, and by the time he gave me the quest, I'd already done it. Similarly, Wood wanted me to recover three antique swords, and I already had them in my possession. Easy experience.There are still a few quests open that I can't figure out or finish right now. There's a location on map B2 where a sign promises a circus, but the circus is never there. A guy on another map wants a cupie doll, and I suspect I need to get it at the circus. A dungeon full of dragons is too tough even for my high-level characters. Finally, I still haven't figured out the name of the guardian pegasus, and I have no idea how to find it.On to Queen Lamanda. She wouldn't speak to me until I dismissed my ninja hireling--the only character not to get his + yet. After dismissing him, she gave me what amounts to the game's main quest (I think).I took a look at the backstory in the game manual again. In the mid-ninth century, King Kalohn went to battle the dragon created by Acwalandar, the water lord. Kalohn had previously used the Orb of Elements to defeat and imprison the elemental lords, but apparently by the time he had to face the dragon, the Orb wasn't at full power. I'm guessing I need to retrieve it from Dawn's cavern and bring it back to Kalohn. But first I thought I'd just pop over and see if I could help him defeat the dragon, Orb or no. I used Lord Peabody's time machine to go back a century. I trudged around the Quagmire of Doom until I found the location of the battle. Alas, I was too late:\"If only you had the Elemental Orb of Talons,\" the game continued.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I then got slaughtered by the \"Mega Dragon\" (none of my attacks or magic could damage him) so clearly I need the Orb.From a message in Vulcania, I know I need the four elemental talons before I can get the Orb, so I headed for the first elemental plane: Air.  I wandered around for a while, killing elementals, before I found the talon I needed, but I was missing something:Okay. Searching through my notes again, I see that I forgot a message from the Tundara dungeon: \"The four discs are needed to get the corresponding talons.\" Messages scattered about other dungeons tell me that the four discs are in various locations in Castle Xabran, which is in...well, I can't find it on my maps. Ah, but here's a message from a cave in Map E3: \"Mystic Castle Xabran, holder of secrets, lies unknown in the 9th century at C2 at 14,8.\" Thank god I took good notes.Returning to Lord Peabody's machine, I travel again to the 800s (I wonder if there's any point traveling to the earlier eras), and I find Castle Xabran at the given location (it's just a pile of ruins in modern times). Aside from the four discs (which I found quite easily), Xabran had an interesting \"hall of spells,\" which told the locations of all of the spells in the game that you need to \"find.\" How someone from the ninth century knew where spells would be found in the tenth, I have no idea. I also found the interleave codes for the yellow and red messages, which I started finding in the elemental planes (before, I thought there were just yellow and green messages), and a list of all the locations where I can find hirelings (again, in the next century!).Acquiring the fire disc.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I was wondering how I was going to get out of the ninth century, but as soon as I left Xabran, for some reason I was back in my own time. That was convenient. Armed with the four discs, I made my way to the four elemental planes, slaying each of the elemental lords (I'm not even sure this was necessary)......and recovering the talons...This took several hours, so I'm wrapping up here for the night. Tomorrow, armed with the four talons, the todilor, the fluxer, the radicon, and the capitor, I need to storm Dawn's Mist Bog and get that Elemental Orb.

They were filled with monsters and mysterious messages that I need to solve the game's various puzzles and quests.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A primary point of dungeon exploration is to get clues like this.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 All of the castles have two dungeon levels below them, none seeming to have anything to do with the castles themselves. Inexplicably, most of them offered the ability to travel via portals to the others.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 A lot of the dungeons feature areas in which certain races and classes are banned, for no reason (it seems) but to make things a little more difficult. Generally when I encounter these, I cast \"Lloyd's Beacon\" to mark the location, \"Town Portal\" to one of the towns, remove the unwanted character or characters at an inn, and \"Lloyd's Beacon\" back to the original location. It doesn't add much to the game experience except time.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In this example, I found an artifact only usable by humans, ironically.\u00a0In the Castle Pinehurst dungeon, I found this wizard, who offered every spell in the game for 2 million gold. I had almost all of them by then, and knew where to get the rest, but I also had plenty of gold. It still seemed like a bit of a cheat.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Interspersed with the dungeon explorations, I started to do the character-specific quests one-by-one. At my level, they haven't been terribly hard. The most difficult part has been getting to and from them. Since each character must go alone (or accompanied by a robber), I don't have my full complement of traveling spells. But between roads and NPCs (who I can dismiss once I find the location), it hasn't been crushingly difficult.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Mistress Quickly earns her plus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of the character quests I've finished so far, the sorcerer quest was by far the most difficult, but also the most fun. I had to navigate two castles (good and evil) full of word puzzles. The evil castle, for instance, began with a message that said \"All that are even are less but odd. All that are odd become more odd.\" The first room had two doors, marked #1 and #2, with a message that said \"It's not one,\" meaning that it's 2. But since \"all that are even are less but odd,\" I really want Door #1. Similarly, the next room had four doors with the notation that \"it is one.\" But since \"all that are odd become more odd,\" I really want Door #3. Fun stuff.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After navigating my way through these doors, I encountered the evil wizard Ybmug in a stasis field with two sets of codes on the walls on either side of him. I couldn't figure out which ones to enter at first, but searching my notes I found a message from the Vulcania dungeons: \"To unlock the frozen secrets of Evil, try Right 46 and Left 23.\" A lot harder than just killing things, which is all the other characters had to do.My cleric got her + by restoring Corak's soul to his body. I rather thought that when this happened, he might give me some hints as to the main quest, or otherwise tell me anything about CRON, Sheltem, and so on. But he just thanked me, gave me some useless advice about where to find the encasement spells (I already have all of them), and disappeared.In some dungeon, I finally encountered a Dagger Jaw, got that reward from Lord Slayer, and was given a third quest to slay a Fire Faery.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Finally, in my explorations, I encountered one enemy so bafflingly evil, it's hard to believe it actually exists: the Phase Spirit. They are utterly immune to melee damage, and a single one can drain every character's hit points to 0 in a single attack. Unless the sorcerer or cleric can kill them all in the first round, there is effectively no way to win against them.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Somewhere along the line, my \"Turn Undead\" spell stopped working completely. It fails every time, for both my priest and my paladin. Their alignments haven't slipped, and I otherwise can't figure out what could be causing it. Other spells seem to work fine. Any ideas?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 One dungeon I've yet to explore is Dawn's Mist Bog Cavern. I know where it is. It seems a lot of things are riding on this dungeon. My ninja needs to kill Dawn to get his plus; some guy named Murray wants me to kill her; I need to free a couple of NPCs; and per the message above, the Elemental Orb is there. My guess is I'll go there next."}, {"title": "Might & Magic II: The Land Explored", "date": "Friday, May 13, 2011", "text": "A composite map of CRON, pieced together from 20 screen shots.First off, I know I haven't been great at keeping a solid posting schedule lately, but the last two days isn't my fault: Blogger has been down. It was rather infuriating having something to publish and not being able to publish it. It also looks like Blogger's problems caused a lot of your comments to get deleted. I have a number in my e-mail from May 11 and 12 that don't appear in the threads. They're not in the spam folder, either. But we'll just have to grin and bear it.I've already covered the major outdoor features in a previous posting, but the other day I  finished my exploration of the surface of CRON, minus a 3 x 3 square on one map (upper right) that contains a \"Dead Zone\" which melts the skin off my characters every time I enter it. This must be the location where Kalohn defeated something (see the back story in my first post on the game). You can see the elemental plains in the four corners, the ice tundra in the northeast, the desert to the east, and the major roads that connect the cities.Might & Magic II joins other games like Ultima IV on shaky cartographic grounds. The game world wraps around itself, so that if you go off the map's north edge, you find yourself on the south edge. You don't have to have training in geography and map projection (and I do) to know that this simply doesn't make sense. The only way to render a spherical surface on a two-dimensional map is to generate significant size distortion at the poles, much like the Mercator projection of the Earth:Hint: Greenland is not actually as big as Africa; Africa is 14 times larger.But this doesn't work on the MM2 map, because the four elemental planes are clearly supposed to be in the \"corners\" of CRON; it makes no sense that I can hop from the Plane of Fire to the Plane of Water in one move, and yet I can. It makes even less sense given that CRON really isn't a planet, but rather a bioengineered spaceship.The \"Eagle Eye\" spell in the upper right shows the \"Four Corners\" of the elemental planes.Suspending disbelief and moving on, though: The furthest corner square in each of the four corners contains a portal to the \"Time\" of that element. I expect I will have to journey to these locations to get the four talons that make up the Elemental Orb, but I haven't precisely been given that quest yet. In the meantime, wandering around these four areas leads to encounters with air, earth, fire, and water elementals, who are reasonably tough customers.Fortunately, however, on one of the maps is a fountain that raises all your attributes to 200 for the next battle. Although it's surrounded by difficult combats, it's a fairly simple matter just to fly to the map and teleport to the precise location of the fountain. If I use this to buff before combat (often in conjunction with \"Lloyd's Beacon\"), there's almost no combat that I can't win.This resulted in a severe game imbalance with a trio of foes on Map B2 called \"cuisinarts\" (presumably because they slice and dice you; I believe the enemy makes a re-appearance in Might & Magic VI). They do devastating damages to my characters--more than 1,000 hit points each. But here's something about combat in Might & Magic that I'm not sure I made clear: when a character is knocked down to 0 hit points or less, he doesn't die; instead, he is rendered \"unconscious.\" If at that point he takes any more damage, he dies, but melee opponents don't target unconscious characters. Thus, the only real danger is 1) if all the members of your party are knocked unconscious; or 2) if your foes have a \"party effect\" attack like fire breath or acid spray, which will turn unconscious characters into dead characters.Thus, as long as I can keep healing unconscious characters at the end of each round, I can keep my party alive no matter how much melee damage the enemies do. Since I got the \"Moon Ray\" spell (which heals all party members, as long as they're outdoors), I can do this. In consequence, staying alive against enemies as tough as cuisinarts is simply a matter of killing them before they can knock my entire party unconscious, which is basically only possible if they get both of my healers in the same round. With the aforementioned attribute boost to 200, that isn't possible even for them.Killing the cuisinart trio nets me 7,500,000 experience points. To put this in perspective, the highest experience point award that I typically got before defeating the cuisinarts was about 50,000. In four combats against them, my characters went from Level 20 to Level 36. All my characters have max spell levels and my fighters have multiple attacks per round, doing serious damage. This is not very good game balance, and I've resolved to leave the cuisinarts alone rather than make it worse.I would never have solved these two encounters, on different maps, if not for meticulous notes.In other outdoor news, Might & Magic II has a lot of special encounters on the game maps, just like the first game. I still haven't solved them all. I don't know the name of the guardian pegasus, and somehow I need to find a cupie doll to give to a raving old man. One notable map location was Murray's Resort Isle in the southwest. I first encountered it just exploring the map and nothing happened for me there. But I later found if I purchased a ticket from the travel agent in Middlegate, it led to a series of attribute-boosting encounters.All right. Based on my notes taken over the last couple months of game play, this is what I know: I now need to complete each of the character-specific quests to get my characters their +s and thus obtain an audience with Queen Lamanda in the Luxus Palace Royale. From there, I'm guessing I'll have a quest that involves time travel (I've gained access to a time machine and have various notes about where people are in previous centuries). I assume that I will have to eventually visit each of the four elemental planes, get the four talons, assemble the Orb of the Elements (or whatever it's called), and defeat....what? That's the real question. Other than some vague notes about Sheltem (the villain from the first game), I'm not really sure what the threat to CRON is.Unlike my gameplay in I, I have mostly not been exploring the various caves, castles, and dungeons as I come across them. My intention at this point is to map all of the indoor and underground locations, complete the character-specific quests, and then get on to the main quest.If I have any readers in the Kansas City area, you have the opportunity to achieve your quest to buy me a GIMLET on Monday or Tuesday nights next week. (This is a quest you all assume by reading this blog in the first place.) E-mail me if you want to give it a go."}, {"title": "Might & Magic II: Castles and Quests, Part II", "date": "Tuesday, May 10, 2011", "text": "Thanks for making that clear, strange person scrawling oddly detailed message on the wall of a random dungeon, trusting that the social institutions you reference will remain active at the point that another stranger comes along and reads this message, and that by then the bishops will not have already died or have been freed.When I last posted about Might & Magic II, I was hanging around Castle Hillstone, trying to slay all of the various creatures that Lord Slayer wanted. Eventually, he gave me a quest to kill a Dagger Jaw, which I've never even seen in the game, so I decided to try some other castles.In Pinehurst, I found the answer to some confusion with a message on the wall:The \"Triple Crown\" doesn't just mean winning three battles of each of the ticket colors; it means winning a battle in each of the three arenas. With that knowledge in hand, I bought three tickets of each of the four colors and went back to each of the arenas. In fairly short order, I became a \"Triple Crown winner\" for each of the colors, and now when I free the bishops in the castles, I'll get a lot more experience. Plus, based on a message I received in a dungeon, I'm \"halfway to an audience with Queen Lamanda.\"In Castle Pinehurst, I found an J-26 Fluxer, bringing the number of oddly-named objects that I carry to three. Per a message in a dungeon, \"Fluxer, Radicon, Todilor, and Capitor are essential to gain the Element Orb.\" I still lack the Todilor.Also in Pinehurst, I found the most B.S. trap I've ever encountered in a CRPG:I ran afoul of these traps twice, meaning it's suddenly the year 902 and all my characters are 20. A message around the door frames in the castle warns that the world will end in the year 1,000, so I have to be careful with these traps. I'm making a note, though, to see what happens in the year 1,000 after I win the game.Lord Peabody, of Castle Pinehurst, gave me a quest to find his servant, Sherman. I had a previous message that he was being held captive in Native's Cove. After searching the area fruitlessly, I discovered that I had already freed him and he was waiting for me in Atlantium, so I temporarily dumped Harry Kari and added him to my party. Lord Peabody was suitably grateful:I don't know quite what to do with the time machine yet, aside from a few scattered notes, so I think I'll leave it alone for now.The last castle I explored as part of my overland exploration was the Luxus Palace Royale, which turns out to be the castle of Queen Lamanda. Unfortunately, she can't give me a quest, but what she says tells me something about what I need to do next:I have gained the Triple Crown, so what I'm lacking is the \"plus.\" Based on a message I found at Mount Fairview, I know that the \"plus\" is the advancement my characters get when they complete the character-specific quests that were outlined on the statues in Atlantium.The plaque outlines all of the character quests:Knights must defeat the Dread Knight of Jouster's WayPaladins must defeat the Frost Dragon who resides in the dungeon beneath the Forbidden ForestArchers must stop Baron Wilfrey from terrorizing Falcon ForestClerics have to reunite the soul of mighty Corak with his bodySorcerers must release both the Good and Evil Wizards from the Isle of the AncientsNinjas must assassinate the chaotic Dawn of Dawn's Mist BogBarbarians must defeat Brutal Bruno, the Barbarian ChieftanRobbers must accompany at least one other class on their missionsAside from the robbers, the classes have to do these quests alone, which poses some problems. Aside from the obvious drawback of not having a full complement of characters to help in the fight, cast spells, heal, and so on, there's the difficulty associated with getting to each of the quest locations without the sorcerer's ability to cast \"Fly\" or \"Lloyd's Beacon.\" However, judicious use of NPCs is probably the answer: I can have as many NPC paladins as I desire accompany my PC paladin. Moreover, since you can \"dismiss\" NPCs whenever you want, I could have an NPC sorcerer get the party to the right location and then send him packing back to town.My characters are still getting their butts kicked on a semi-regular basis, though, so I think I'll finish my general exploration of CRON's surface before attempting the class-specific quests.Some other scattered notes:I have far too much gold: more than 7 million. The NPCs are starting to cost a bit (more than 1000 a day for each), but that's still a drop in the bucket. The shops have stopped selling things powerful enough to interest me. I pay for temple blessings before setting out on each quest, but other than that, I have no idea what to do with all this gold.Equipment progression is still reasonably solid. On every map, I pick up two or three items more powerful than something that one of my characters is already carrying. Powerful items are tied to alignment, so if I find a Fiery Spear +11 that only evil characters can use, I either need to ditch it or save it for an NPC I don't normally travel with. I don't know how high the +s go; my highest right now is 15.This dark trident rocks.As in the first game, there are fountains that temporarily raise statistics and special encounters that raise them permanently.My primary spellcasters have achieved Level 8 and, consequently, some excellent spells. The cleric spell \"Moon Ray\" simultaneously heals PCs and damages enemies, which is enough to keep my party alive round after round in tough outdoor battles--but it only works outdoors. The sorcerer spell \"Dancing Sword\" does some significant damage to 10 monsters at a time, but I can only cast one or two before my spell points are gone.Alas, I helped the village achieve its destiny.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm encountering a lot of battles in which I get attacked by 255 of something. Hardly ever are these monsters particularly difficult. There are no spells that affect all foes--only those on the visible screen--so defeating them generally involves holding down CTRL-A while I browse Reddit on my iPhone.It's good to be blogging again. In my next post, I'll finish up with the outdoor areas and move to the underground."}, {"title": "CRPGs, Blogging, and Time Management", "date": "Tuesday, May 10, 2011", "text": "Note: I wrote the following on April 17 (hence the reference to \"home in front of my computer all week\"). I didn't post it at the time because it didn't seem like a good blog entry, and I couldn't figure out a way to incorporate images. I still have the same concerns, but I'm offering it now as a precursor to the rest of the week. I'm playing MM2 again but I need to rack up some playing time before I can issue the next post. Thanks for bearing with me.As I've probably mentioned before, I'm a pretty busy guy. So I've read a lot about time management, and I try to dedicate a good portion of every day to tackling the priorities on my \"to do\" list. However, it has been literally years since I had the capability to focus on a single task for more than an hour at a time--and an hour is really stretching it. Thus, I have an odd system by which I do things in 15 minute chunks. Every morning, I sort my to do list by a formula that takes into consideration the start date, the due date, the priority, and the number of hours it will take me to complete it. I work on Task #1 for 15 minutes, then work on Task #2 for 15 minutes. Then I spend 15 minutes each on #1, #2, and #3, then 15 minutes each on #1 through #4, and so on, until the end of the day (I rarely get past Task #8). The virtue of this system is that Task #1 always gets the most attention, but I never have to do it for more than 15 minutes at a time. The only rule-breaking I allow myself is that if the mood strikes me, I can continue working on Task #1 for as long as I want. But everything else has a 15 minute limit.This has worked out pretty well for me, but it was only recently that I realized another strategy that should work for you no matter what time management system you use. It seems natural to work on something until you reach a good \"stopping point.\" That's what most people do. Finish reading this chapter, finish writing this paragraph, finish this e-mail, finish this presentation slide. While this brings a certain sense of accomplishment, it makes it harder to re-start the task or project after you've taken a break. Think about it. Say you're writing a term paper, and you promise yourself you can take a break once you finish the literature review. So you write and write and finally reach the end of the section and triumphantly close the document. Feels great. But then, the next time you open it, it's like you're starting a whole new project. You have to type the next section heading, figure out how to begin the first paragraph, sketch a rough outline for what you want to say in the section. It's like jumping right from your bed into the busiest part of the day without your shower and breakfast first.Thus, my new strategy: don't wait for a good \"stopping point\"; instead, stop working at a moment when you know exactly what the next steps are going to be. Stop in the middle of a paragraph--the middle of a sentence, even. Most people don't like to stop when they're \"on a roll,\" but \"on a roll\" is exactly when you should stop, because it makes it so much easier to get the roll going when you pick up the task again. You finish the sentence, finish the paragraph, and by then the pump is primed and you can move on to the next step much more fluidly.Looking back through my blog, I can see the same principle applying. When am I most prolific? When I'm at the transition point between games. You can see why. The \"won\" posting is usually fun to write, and then the \"final rating\" posting writes itself. After that, my next posting is always the beginning of a new game, which is usually fairly easy. That's three postings in a row in which I know exactly what I'm going to write. Sometimes I write them all on the same day and space out their publication. When I hit on a string of short games, I might have two or three weeks of uninterrupted blogging, as I did in January this year, despite the fact I was traveling for most of it.When do I take the longest breaks? When I'm in the middle of a particularly long game. Right now, in the middle of Might & Magic II. I took long breaks during both The Bard's Tale II and Demon's Winter. Last December, in the intermediate levels of Dungeon Master. Last May, in Ultima IV. I don't know how I missed this pattern before. I've been telling myself that it's my travel and work schedule, but the truth is, I've been using my travel and work schedule as an excuse to avoid playing games. Isn't it supposed to be the other way around?The middle of a game is where I find it the most difficult to structure entries. After my last Might & Magic II posting, I thought I had a plan: I'd do my next three postings on dungeons, quests, and spells in that order. I even started three separate blog drafts where I could plug in screenshots and tidbits as I encountered them. But the whole thing became so complicated that, even though I've been at home in front of my computer all week, I've actually procrastinated on playing games because without knowing exactly how I was going to write the next posting, it seemed like too much of an effort.Therefore, I'm going to apply my general time management strategy to blogging. No more calling it a night at the end of a posting. Instead, I'm going to force myself to start the next posting right after I finish the current one. That should make it easier to get back into it when I return."}, {"title": "The CRPG Addict Isn't Dead", "date": "Monday, May 2, 2011", "text": "Readers,I can't tell you what's been going on without revealing more of my personal and professional life than I want to reveal on this blog. Suffice to say that none of your amusing suppositions--that my wife has forbidden me from blogging, that I have gotten a divorce, that I am dead, that I am either bin Laden or on the SEAL team that killed bin Laden--is quite true.The bottom line is that the first line of my first posting turned out to be prophetic, but things are getting better. In fact, I had something of a revelation a few weeks ago when I realized that I enjoy CRPG blogging more than most things I do professionally. I've spent some time recently jettisoning some of my roles to make sure I have more time for my hobbies (my CRPG playing isn't the only thing to have taken a hit lately) and that I can keep a more regular posting schedule.I've finally emerged from the weeds this week...just in time for JazzFest in New Orleans.

On every map, I kept stumbling into fights that were way beyond my ability, whether a trio of Cuisinarts, 250 cat corpses led by a \"Cat from Hell,\" various high-level elementals, impossible-to-hit undead, or a pile of \"cosmic sludge.\"My characters experimented briefly with L.S.D.Ultimately, I decided I was approaching it the wrong way. Working my way systematically through each map, in order, was poor role-playing. The thing to do, rather, was to explore the game world by terrain feature. Naturally, real characters would walk the roads and visit the various towns and castles first. Thus, after a particularly hard battle with a \"Jouster\" that left my party slaughtered, I shook myself off, re-started in Middlegate, and headed out the front door to fully explore the road network.The path east from Middlegate took me to a ferryboat crossing, which I paid even though I could have used \"Water Walk.\" It ultimately worked its way south, through maps I had not yet explored, where the path forked, with the easternmost heading towards Sandsobar (where I had been) and the southermost towards Castle Hillstone (where I had not).My normal inclination was to explore the castle much like any dungeon, following the rightmost path and mapping in detail. But I decided to do this one in more of a role-playing spirit, and thus when I saw two doors, one which said \"No entry!\" and one which said \"Slayer's Palace,\" I took the latter. I worked my way down the corridor that seemed most likely to lead to the ruler's throne room, passing a horribly unfunny jester along the way.I actually miss Chuckles.In no time, I was before Lord Slayer in his throne room. \"Heads of monstrous beasts\" adorned his walls, and he wanted me to collect more. Offering me a choice of quests at four levels (page, squire, knight, lord), I got a quest to find and destroy a Crazed Dwarf. That shouldn't be too hard. Although I don't know of any certain location for them, I remember encountering them in Middlegate's dungeon.Of course, I couldn't leave it at this: I needed to fully explore the castle. And this is where the role-playing broke down a bit. In corridor after corridor, I encountered packs of Castle Guards and mercilessly slaughtered them--they left me no choice, attacking the moment I stepped into their squares. But it was important to explore, because at one point I found a N-19 Capitor, which I need for...something.Oddly, this didn't seem to affect the lords' dispositions towards me.Let me back up on quests. This was the first official quest I had received, and this is only possible because one of my characters has the \"crusader\" skill, which allows quests to be bestowed upon the party. One of the oddities of both this game and its predecessor is that once you have been awarded a quest, you can't accept any others until it is completed. Fortunately, if you get a quest that proves too difficult, helpful guards in each of the castles......sell \"Uncle Spudly's New and Improved Quest Removal Elixir,\" which does what it suggests, allowing you to get a new quest from the same lord or a different one. This would be helpful if, for instance, I had trouble tracking down a crazed dwarf. From a story standpoint, it makes no sense, of course, and this gets back to what I was saying in my third posting about the game about it not taking itself seriously. While I welcome humor in games, I don't welcome goofiness, and Might & Magic II, while offering excellent gameplay, is simply full of goofiness like this.I just hope he didn't mount the head on the wall.It didn't take me long to find and kill a crazed dwarf, and when I returned to Lord Slayer, I got 4000 experience and a new quest to find a Bonehead. I know I've encountered them before, but I can't remember where, so I just continued exploring.My travels also brought me to a different castle, Woodhaven, and it was much the same. There, the lord also offered four levels of quests, only in his case it was to retrieve specific items, not to kill monsters. In both castles, I found an imprisoned bishop, and the colored keys I'd bought in towns freed them from their chains. Although both granted me experience for freeing them, a note indicated that I'd have a lot more experience if I'd been a \"triple crown winner\" of the bishop's color. I expect this means I have to win three arena battles of each color. I hope the bishops are re-imprisoned when I return; otherwise, I've missed out on a lot of potential experience.Each castle also had a dungeon that I haven't yet explored.At one point, in Castle Hillstone, I fought my way through an entire hall of monsters and got this cryptic message. I have no idea what it means, but I think I got it, under similar circumstances, in other Might & Magic games. I'm afraid of spoilers if I try to confirm.More goofiness."}, {"title": "Might & Magic II: Touring the Countryside", "date": "Sunday, April 10, 2011", "text": "Not quite as picturesque as the Andes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over the last 10 days, I have been traveling constantly through South America and, at the same time, fitfully through the land of Cron. Travel through Cron is rendered easier with a number of spells, any of which I would have liked to cast in real life. Consider:\"Water Walking,\" obtained in MM2 from a man walking on a river near Middlegate, allows exploration of oceans and lakes. With it, I could have strolled across Rio de La Plata between Buenos Aires and Montevideo, instead of taking a noisome ferry.\"Fly\" instantly whisks you to one of Cron's 20 maps, dropping you in a safe zone (unless you've eaten peasant). The real flight from Boston to Buenos Aires was interminable, and I would have appreciated a quicker method. I'm pretty sure I haven't eaten any Argentinan peasants, although a hamburger I had on the edge of the Palermo District definitely wasn't beef.Lloyd, who was in Corak's Cave just as the message in the Middlegate dungeon said he was, taught me \"Lloyd's Beacon,\" which allows me to mark a spot and recall myself to it later. This would definitely be useful for returning home each evening, where my air conditioning actually works.\"Surface\" provides a quick escape from dungeons. In real life, I'd use this to avoid the two-mile walk and four-hour wait at customs in Atlanta.\"Time Distortion\" provides quick escape from encounters, allowing you to regroup and try again before re-engaging 3 GATE AGENTS or 17 COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO THINK IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO WEAR PAJAMAS TO THE AIRPORT.This is either a screenshot or a photograph I took outside San Esteban in Chile.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Teleport\" moves you up to 9 squares in any direction, thus bypassing long security lines and fellow travelers seeking to shove piano-sized suitcases into overhead bins.I don't have \"Town Portal\" yet, but this would be the best real-life spell. Travel between Boston and Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires and Santiago, Santiago and Bogota, with the ability to go home every night. I won't bore you with anything else about my South America excursion except one tip: La Avenida 11 de Septiembre in Santiago does not commemorate the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, and if you suggest as much to your attache, you will wish for simultaneous castings of \"Time Distortion,\" \"Erase Memory,\" and \"Instantaneous Death\" (on yourself).The availability of so many spells means that  towns, and safety, are usually a short jaunt away. I am suffering fewer  full-party deaths than I remember in the first game. If a single  character survives, I can usually limp my way back to a town and heal.  If I run up against a group of foes I know I can't defeat, \"Time  Distortion\" usually works to get me away--I just need my sorcerer to  survive the first round.The overall MM2 game map. The elemental bits in the corner aren't just decorations; you actually find the elemental planes in those corners.The outdoor world of Might & Magic II consists of 20 maps arranged in a 5 x 4 grid. Each map, like the dungeons, is 256 squares, and each is easily accessible with the \"Fly\" spell. The maps quite notably correspond with the pictures on the game map. So in the lower left, where you see water and islands and such, the 16 x 16 map looks like this:The lower left corner isn't exactly the Elemental Plane of Water, but rather an issuance from it. In the far corner of each corner map is a portal to the related elemental plane. I'm not strong enough to begin to explore these.Exploring randomly in Might & Magic II is just as dangerous as in the first game. Difficulty varies considerably even on the same map. On one square you're fighting a gathering of orcs, and on the next you run into one of the most difficult monsters in the game.And you die.Aside from the dangers, moving around the game world in MM2 is fundamentally different than MM1. Outdoor areas in the first game were essentially dungeons with different textures. Forests and mountains formed \"walls,\" and there were even secret passages through them. In contrast, in MM2, there are no \"barriers\" to your progress through the outdoor maps (as long as you have the pathfinding and mountaineering skills and the \"Water Walk\" spell, anyway). Forests, mountains, water, and other landscape features form the texture of the squares themselves.The Might & Magic series is known for the depth of its quests and special encounters, and this game is no exception. Special encounters in the outdoor maps take several forms:Difficult, fixed monsters. You see my ill-fated battle with the Cuisinarts above. Other fixed battles have included an impossible-to-hit \"Mist Rider,\" a convention of 250 orcs, a group of \"white knights\" that only males can damage, a \"Mist Warrior\" who gave me the \"Dancing Sword\" spell; a group of high-level undead at a shipwreck; and some \"cosmic sludge\" dripping from the sky. Most of these enemies I have been unable to defeat, but my prowess is growing.I disrupted their convention.Fountains. All the Might & Magic games seem to feature fountains that temporarily boost your statistics. I've found several that boost one statistic, and one, near Atlantium, that boosts all seven of the stats to 100. It's only good for one battle, but it has been useful against the water elementals on the same map, which offer high experience. In conjunction with the \"Fly\" or \"Lloyd's Beacon\" spells, the fountain serves as a useful shot-in-the-arm before particularly hard battles. Some fountains poison or kill you, though.Castles and Caves. Each map has two or three entrances to castles, dungeons, and other indoor maps.Pinehurst and Peabody are both communities in Massachusetts, fairly close to each other. Coincidence?Natural disasters. In the four \"elemental\" maps, and those adjacent, you run into blizzards, earthquakes, tidal waves, and other natural disasters that do significant damage and sweep you to some other square on the map, making mapping difficult. At first, I thought these were random, but later I realized they always occur on certain squares.Messages. I keep encountering signposts like this one, which ultimately will reveal a message once I figure out the interleave. As I said last week, this breaks the immersion of the game a bit. It's hard to imagine someone taking the trouble to make these posts and stick them around Cron, and that no one damages or removes them. You can just imagine a farmer finding this in his field, scratching his head, and chopping it down for firewood. Other signs indicate routes to castles and towns.\"Wat\" was my reaction, too.Spells. You \"find\" spells in abandoned keeps and ruins sometimes, rounding out those you get automatically when you advance. Incidentally, my paladin and archer are starting to pick up spell levels, making them more useful.Other special encounters include a test of strength with some lumberjacks; a \"gourmet\" who wants to speak to someone who has tried every meal in every tavern; prisoners staked to small islands; a \"guardian pegasus\" who wants me to find her name; a \"magic monster pit\" that produces random encounters; and a sparkling pool, bathing in which melts all of the objects in my backpack.As in dungeons, the way you're facing sometimes determines whether you find the encounter on the square or not. It's important to look at the map and make sure you're facing north when the path ends at a north-facing dead end. The only other option is to literally approach every square from all four directions.As I explore outdoors, I'm also popping into some dungeons (which I'll write about next) and trying to figure out the main quest (which I'll write about in two postings). Right now, my only real complaint about the game is that I have nothing to spend my rapidly-accumulating money on, but we'll see if that holds."}, {"title": "Might & Magic II: Anatomy of Combat", "date": "Wednesday, March 30, 2011", "text": "RE: my comment yesterday: Apparently, \"roasted peasant\" wasn't just a bad pun. This is also on the \"safe\" square of the map, so every time I \"Fly\" to this map or flee combat while on it, I end up back here facing mad peasants.When it comes to combat tactics, it still seems to me that Wizardry--one of the very first CRPGs--did it best (I wrote about it a year ago). Not only were there a lot of things to do in combat (attacking, blocking, casting, fleeing) but the nature of each foe demanded a unique strategy. Moreover, since you couldn't just rest, heal, and regain your spell points immediately after combat, the game required efficiency: you had to save your best spells for the times you really needed them. Every battle was a balance between sacrificing too many hit points and sacrificing too many spells, and every exploration was a balance between mapping just a few more squares and returning to the safety of the surface. Oh, and with quasi-permanent death, battle had real consequences. I felt real fear and tension exploring Wizardry's dungeon.Might & Magic II, while very similar to Wizardry in combat options, is very different from the earlier game in its overall tactics. First of all, full-party death isn't permanent; your party gets restarted at the last inn if they all die. While it sucks to lose whatever amount of exploration you'd accomplished since that last save, it's not as taking-a-golf-club-to-your-monitor-inducing as having to re-generate an entire party. This translates to a lesser, shall we say, \"investment\" in combat--with both good and bad consequences.More important, in MM2, you can rest in almost every square and get all your hit points and spell points restored. There are exceptions, and they add an extra level of tactical difficulty, but they are rare. This means that you might as well throw all your best spells and attacks at every foe. Combat tactics--and I know I've said this before, so I apologize--are about individual battles rather than the accumulation of battles. The question of whether to prolong an expedition and risk losing your progress, or whether to return and save, still applies, though less pressingly once you acquire the \"Lloyd's Beacon\" spell (see below).This isn't to say that I turn battle into a cataclysm of fire and lightning for each group of kobolds I encounter. In fact, quite the opposite. While the ability to rest and heal means that I don't have to worry so much about spell points, it also means I don't need to worry so much about hit points. There's no sense in wasting too much time trying to turn a 20% loss of hit points into a 10% loss of hit points when you can rest in a few minutes and get 100% of your hit points restored. Thus, I often CTRL-A my way through battles even if it means taking a bigger hit. It's a lot less effort to type the (r)est key than to meticulously plan tactics against a group of zombies.To illustrate, let's look at three combats of various difficulty. In the first one, in Corak's Cave, I face a moderately-sized group of zombies and skeletons. The most efficient way to approach this battle would be to fireball the group of non-melee zombies (from G onward) and then for my cleric to cast \"Turn Undead\" to mop up the skeletons. But it would also take time, and for no better result (it turns out) than to save Bolingbroc 19 hit points and Valstaff 3. So instead, after a couple of manual attacks, I hold down CTRL-A and let the automatic attacks do their work.I don't regret this, because the next combat puts me face-to-face with a group of \"coffin creeps,\" whose attacks drain all magic points, instantly, from all characters. This means I have to rest and heal right away anyway; it's dangerous to go wandering around with no spell points.\u00a0 \u00a0 I draw the CTRL-A line, however, at times when I risk killing one of my characters. I don't have \"Raise Dead\" yet, and that spell carries a risk anyway, so each death requires a trip back to the temple in town--and the dead character gets no experience points from the battle.This battle is a little tougher. The party is led by two kobold captains--I can brush them aside like ants--but includes five shamans. I know from experience trying to use CTRL-A against them that shamans cast \"Paralyze,\" which not only removes each affected party member from combat but also kills your party if all members are affected. I can't treat them lightly. I'm not terrified of them, and I have no thoughts of fleeing, but I have to make sure my fighters target them and that I hit them with the best spells that I have.The video shows the result. I target my fighters' attacks on the shamans, taking out most of them, and then eliminate the rest with a lightning bolt from my sorcerer. Fortunately, their speed is slow, so all my characters get an attack before they can start in with their spells. Once the shaman threat is dealt with, I CTRL-A the kobolds and move on.This last one is much harder, and in fact I lose. I come just shy of losing my entire party. The combat takes place in Sarakin's Mine in Map A2. I've heard that some NPCs are hanging around in here, and while I don't need them, I figured I'd explore. The cave has yielded some decent experience--by the time the video begins I've mapped about half the cave and have amassed about 40,000 experience points from numerous fixed battles with groups of five wraiths each. Now I've come across a door labeled \"Friends of Sarakin,\" and when I enter, I meet tougher undead.\u00a0 \u00a0 This is the first time I've ever faced either mummies or grim reapers. They sound nasty, so I immediately sit up and prepare for the worst. I've surprised the monsters, which theoretically increases my chances of a successful (h)ide or (r)un. I briefly consider it. Hiding keeps you in the same square and I don't think it works on fixed encounters. Running returns you to the dungeon entrance. I've just cast \"Lloyd's Beacon\" outside the entrance to this room, so I know I can return if I need to, and I don't want to lose my experience.Ultimately, I decide to attack. The grim reapers turn out to be the most dangerous enemy, and the game puts me in a bad position by starting them in the rear, where my melee fighters can't attack them. First, I check their spell resistances. I've found a \"Storm Wand,\" which casts \"Lightning Bolt,\" and I've given it to Valstaff, my character with the highest speed (and thus first in every combat). At 00:14, you can see me try it out on the creatures, with no effect to either the mummies or the reapers. Bollocks.I start concentrating every missile attack I can on the reapers, but shots from three characters barely make a dent in one. They're slow, so they haven't had an attack yet (00:26). My sorcerer is up next. Knowing that \"Lightning Bolt\" doesn't work, I try \"Fireball.\" I see a little success against the mummies but not the reapers (00:30).Then it's the grim reapers' turns. Both cast \"Fingers of Death\" and immediately kill my paladin and barbarian (00:35). The two mummies in melee range are no pushovers either and do devastating damage to my knight and ninja. Last to go is Peta, my cleric, who would normally heal Harry Kari, but I need to at least try \"Turn Undead.\" Not surprisingly on this level of undead, it doesn't work (00:42).Early in the next round, my archer manages to kill one of the grim reapers, but the mummies continue to do heavy damage and hardly anything affects them. At 01:33, my sorcerer goes down, and if I can't bring him back, I lose my chance at escape from combat. Peta heals him, but then things get serious when my cleric is knocked unconscious (01:57). Although I kill the second reaper seconds later (02:06), I've still got four mummies on the board and no healers. After a moment's consideration, Glendower the sorcerer does the responsible thing and \"Time Distorts\" me out of combat. I exit the cave, \"fly\" to Middlegate, and raise my dead. While I'm there, I train Harry Kari up a level and donate at the temple to get the magic and force resistance that the priests confer. Then I cast \"Lloyd's Beacon\" to return to Sarakin's Mine and test myself against them again. With the priests' protections, the \"Fingers of Death\" spell bounces off me, but the mummies still overwhelm me through brute force. On a third visit, I have better odds and manage to defeat them:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Whew. This kind of battle is actually quite rare in the game right now. I usually face either enemies I can defeat without much trouble, or those that so clearly outclass me that I don't bother to retry.A few more thoughts on the resting issue: Might & Magic II could have ramped up the tactical level by including more serious consequences to resting too often. Right now, there are only four, and none of them are consequential enough to worry about:You risk getting attacked in your sleep. Easily countered with the \"Instant Keep\" spell, and random attacks aren't that common anyway.You use a unit of food. But food is cheap and you can carry 40 units. If you could only carry five or six meals, or if each one cost a bundle, it would encourage the player to be a bit more sparing with how often he or she rests.You age a day, and once you hit 75 years of age, there's a chance your characters might die. My characters are all still 18, though (in contrast to the first game, when they aged four or five years in the first town alone), and I'm sure by the time they're in their 30s, I'll have the \"Rejuvenate\" spell. Making the aging faster, or eliminating the spell, would encourage more care in the passage of time.Your NPCs charge for their services. Right now, I'm paying 40 gold pieces per NPC per day, or about a twelfth of what I find in a typical battle. If NPCs charged more (and they do increase their fees as the levels go up), I guess that would make more of a difference.I would have preferred if the game had really made you stop and think before hitting that \"r\" button--if it had encouraged to squeeze every step out of each day. Another alternative would have been to only heal half, or a quarter, of your hit points and spell points with each rest. I'm not trying to complain--it's exactly like Might & Magic I, after all, and I didn't complain there--but I sometimes miss the nail-biting nature of tactical combat in Wizardry.To close for the night, let me recap what I've actually done today. I started exploring outdoors, mapping what I could, noting places that I had to return to or where combat proved impossible at my level. On Map C2, where Middlegate resides, I found Corak's Cave. I decided to explore it even though I knew I would have to come back once I had Corak's soul (the statue in Atlantium had said this). Sure enough, when I got to the chamber marked \"Corak's Crypt,\" something took the \"Admit 8\" pass a zombie had given me in the dungeon below Sandsobar (see yesterday's posting).\u00a0\u00a0 At this point, I made the mistake of turning to have a look behind me, and when I faced the same direction again:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Lesson learned: next time, plow on forward. Now I have to return to Sandsobar and get another pass. But the visit to Corak's Cave was not in vain, as I did find \"Lloyd, of Lloyd's Beacon fame,\" and was granted his extremely useful spell.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Also near Middlegate, I encountered this mysterious pegasus, and got a side quest to figure out his or her name.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Exploring outdoors is significantly different than in Might & Magic I, and I'll cover that in detail tomorrow. For now, I'll note that the graphics are much better, and the automap is rather lovely:I think I'll take a screen shot of each map and assemble them together in one master map at the end."}, {"title": "Might & Magic II: An Urban Tour", "date": "Tuesday, March 29, 2011", "text": "Fresh air at last!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Damn you, readers. If it wasn't for  you, I could be  playing Might & Magic II at 2:00 in the morning instead of writing about it. I suppose I could use the break, though; otherwise, I'll be viewing these wall textures in my dreams.Between last night and today, I visited all of the cities and their associated dungeons. I didn't finish all of them--some of the encounters were too hard--but I got 90% of the mapping and exploration done. Each of the cities was accessible from the others via teleportation services, so only in the last few minutes of gameplay tonight did I venture into the open air.Each of the cities had a theme associated with its surrounding terrain. The walls and textures of the cities didn't change, unfortunately, so the changes were mostly reflected in the names of the stores and some of the creatures.A quick tour:Sandsobar had a desert theme. One section of town was labeled \"The Slums,\" in which I found such enticing encounters as this:I guess this is a \"role-playing\" option.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was also this bit of graffiti on the wall. I couldn't really puzzle anything useful from it. The message written backwards (\"Help me. 15,1\") sounds like it should have been something, but I didn't find anything at those coordinates in either the town or the dungeon beneath it.In the dungeon, a \"master thief\" taught pilfering to my rogue and theoretically boosted his thieving statistic, but I didn't notice any difference. None of the skills that say they boost an attribute actually show an increase in the attribute's statistic. It must happen behind the scenes. In one place, a zombie came out of nowhere and gave me a pass to Corak's Cavern:\"How did you get this?\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tundara was the third town, with a snow theme. Messages on the walls told of strange disappearances and mutilations of townsfolk, and there was this ominous warning from a beggar:Apparently, the snowbeast damages one's socioeconomic status.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The perimeter wall of the town was closed off until I found a secret door right next to an invisible barrier. A march around the perimeter took me to a button that turned off the barrier, and when I made the return trek, I came face-to-face with the snowbeast.Or \"beasts,\" as it happens.I died in about six seconds, so I made a note to return when stronger. This encounter takes place in anti-magic zone, so there's no hope of using fireballs or other flame spells, nor any hope of healing downed characters.The Tundara dungeon had a lot of useful messages (more on that in a minute), but also a memorable encounter with 200 killer cadavers:Since killer cadavers explode, doing damage to the entire party, and I don't have any kind of party-heal spell, this battle is going to have to wait until later. I didn't even come close to winning.Vulcania had a lava theme going. In the center of town were four statues that each had part of a message. The entire thing spelled out: \"Water, fire, earth, and air. All have a king within their lair. They hold the talons you need to find to save Cron before its time.\"One wonders what the townsfolk think of these statues.The dungeon had a host of bubbling lava pits, which you only have to wander into once to be reminded to keep a \"levitation\" spell active while exploring dungeons. At one point, the game had me encounter a \"lumbering giant singing a ballad.\" By staying to listen, everyone's endurance increased by 10 points. The first game also had places where you could achieve a one-time increase in each statistic.I also rescued some more NPCs in the dungeon, including a ninja named Harry Kari (nice cultural sensitivity there). Since I didn't have a ninja in my party but did have two knights, I booted the knight NPC, signed up Harry, and immediately equipped him with a Naginata +4 that I had been saving just for that purpose. You are wondering what a Naginata is, and I am happy to show you, courtesy of Wikipedia.It looks like it hurts.The last town was Atlantium, which had a Greco-Roman theme. The most notable thing about the city was how expensive everything was: 4,000 for healing, 50,000 for the black key, 50,000 to join the mage's guild, and so on. I got most of my characters the hero/heroine skill, which supposedly boosts all statistics.There were more statues in Atlantium, and they indicated that the game features class-specific quests. Paladins have to slay a dragon in the Forbidden Forest; ninjas have to slay a villain named Dawn; barbarians must slay a barbarian chieftain named Brutal Bruno, and so on. I think this is the first game to offer such class-specific quests unless you count that small dungeon in Demon's Winter.And apparently I can resurrect Corak.Atlantium's dungeon was impossible at my level--which, by the way, only rose once in four towns. I think the game made it easy to get up to Level 7 because that's where you were expected to start if you imported characters from the first game.A few notes common to each town:Each of the towns boasted a locksmith that sold a different colored key. I bought them all except the black one in Atlantium, which cost 50,000 gold. I have no idea what they do.The shop in each town sold a different colored arena ticket, although not every town had an arena: only Middlegate, Sandsobar, and Atlantium. It appears the difficulty is tied to the color or level of the ticket and not to the town. I was able to win the first three battles but no the last two levels yet. According to a message I found, I need to win the highest level (black) to achieve an audience with the queen.The taverns in each town had unusual selections of drinks and food. I don't know why I would want to pay 5000 gold pieces for a meal of \"pickled pixie brains,\" but I figured I'd better try them all in case I'd miss something otherwise. From a note I got in the Vulcania dungeon, I suspect that having the meal of deep-fried troll liver got me access to two NPCs: Thund R. the barbarian (yes, seriously--we need to have a talk about this in a minute) and Ariel the sorceress, who were said to like the dish.I can't think of anything less appealing than \"cream of kobold.\"There were dozens of messages in the dungeons that I don't really understand, but I'm sure I will eventually. Among other things, I recorded the castles and locations of three strange-sounding devices: J-26 fluxers, M-27 radicons, and A-1 todilors. There were clues to the locations of more NPCs (although I can't imagine needing them), various spells, and the four elemental discs I need to get the four talons. There were some coordinates concerning the locations of various people in history.If you donate enough money at temples, you get all buffing spells cast on you at once, at levels beyond the capabilities of your characters. This is a good way to prepare for a tough battle, although the amount of money you have to donate before it happens varies--I think I was out more than 3,000 gold once.Yesterday, I talked about crazed dwarves and how much I hated them. Well, it turns out that they're only one of several types of creatures that do massive damage in the process of suicide-bombing you. The others include crazed natives (yes, they're back), mad peasants, and the aforementioned killer cadavers. Basically, my party needs to have well over 100 hit points before I can survive encountering parties of these bastards.I want to know why they don't damage their own party members.The game is fond of luring you with a false sense of security. You'll have explored 90% of a dungeon, facing nothing more serious than parties of six orcs, and then suddenly you blunder into a random encounter with oh, how about fire-breathing earth wyrms that do 65 points of damage per character per round?Some would find this very frustrating, but I think it's part of the challenge of the game. You have to constantly weight the odds and decide whether to gamble another 10 squares in the dungeon before returning to the surface, or whether to play it save and map the rest of the dungeon on another trip. Decide wrong, and everything you've achieved in the last 40 minutes disappears.I continue to get valuable equipment upgrades almost constantly. The game identifies your findings immediately--if you find a fire sabre +5, it's listed as such when you pick it up--none of this \"unidentified weapon\" nonsense that other games give you. But there's still an \"identify\" option in the shops; this selection tells you more about the item, such as its specific powers and charges, and who can equip it. Here, for instance, I was delighted to find that my ray gun, in addition to casting the \"energy blast spell\" (sorcerer spell 1-3), also boosts the accuracy of anyone that wields it. I wouldn't have thought to equip it otherwise.So I'm still having a lot of fun. I just wish the game took itself more seriously. I don't have any problem with humor, but there's a difference between humor and goofiness, and Might & Magic II leans a bit too far towards the latter. I increase my endurance by listening to a singing ogre. We have NPCs named Thund R., Harry Kari, Sir Kill, Jed I, and Spaz Twit. A zombie, for no apparent reason, gives me an admission ticket to Corak's Cave. I fight armies of cripples. The tavern leaves the \"h\" out of \"roasted pheasant\" (ho, ho). A statue references wizards named Ybmug and Yekop (read them backwards). Add this to the nonsensical existence of clues written randomly on dungeon walls, and you have a game that makes it hard to suspend disbelief and just enjoy it. It's always stopping to say, \"Hey! This is just a game! And look how clever we are!\"If you don't groan reading this, you didn't grow up in the 1980s.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That doesn't make it not fun--it's still probably the best game I've played so far in this blog--it's just not quite as fun as if it took the world it created seriously and populated it with more realistic and interesting NPCsOh, I almost forgot. I donated at each of the temples and got a \"Fe Farthing,\" which I tossed into the fountain in Middlegate and was rewarded (somehow) with a castle key.Is it a key to a fabulous castle, or is the key itself...oh, never mind.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With this, my only active quest ends and I have no specific direction except to follow my dungeon clues and look into some of the class-specific quests. I look forward to seeing what the surface of Cron has to offer."}, {"title": "Might & Magic II: Packed with Stuff", "date": "Sunday, March 27, 2011", "text": "A \"swamp dog\" would be a good name for a cocktail.Since I last wrote, all I've really done is explore the 16 x 16 dungeon beneath Middlegate, and I have so much stuff to tell you, I hardly know where to begin. Let me try to organize it as best I can.1. The PlotAside from finding a few cryptic messages in the dungeons, I don't know that I did much to advance the main quest. As in Might & Magic I, I don't really have any idea what the main quest is. But I did ultimately find the wizard's golden goblet in the lair of some goblins, and when I returned it to him, he was suitably grateful:So...you just scattered our reward money on the floor?Nordon then sent me on to his sister, Nordonna, who had another problem to deal with:Um...where are you?Drog and Hyron turned out to be the \"children\" that the tavern tale indicated were at coordinates 0,15. I slew the kobolds and released them from their shackles.\"You're welc...hey! Come back here!\"When I returned to Nordonna, she told me that I could hire her sons at the inn. More important, she gave me another quest: to visit all the towns, donate at the temples, and return to the Feldecarb Fountain in Middlegate. I found this when I was exploring the town. The fountain asks if I want to \"flick a farthing,\" and when I say yes, it says, \"Fool! You have no farthing to flick!\" Presumably donating at the temples gets me a farthing. I don't know if that is has anything to do with the main quest, but I was going to visit each of the towns in order anyway, so it squares with my existing plan.Meanwhile, I picked up Drog (a barbarian) and Sir Hyron (a knight) at the inn, rounding out my party with eight members. The more members you have, the less experience each member gets, but this limitation is far outweighed by the value of having a couple more fighters near the front ranks. Now my archer and robber can hang back and snipe enemies with arrows while hardy fighters take the brunt of the attacks.Disappointingly (to me), a return visit to Nordon has him ask me to retrieve the golden goblet again from the goblins in the dungeon. You can keep re-doing this quest indefinitely (but not Nordonna's). I'd rather have the sense that I was making permanent changes to the game world.2. The PartyAll my characters are about Level 8 at this point. I understand that Level 7 is the maximum level that characters imported from Might & Magic I can achieve. So the gameplay so far has basically just been to get my characters into fighting shape.Oddly, the hirelings seem to both train and heal for free, which makes me wonder if a good strategy would be to create a single character of your own and then populate the rest of the party with hirelings (presuming there are that many). I'm not interested in doing that just to save some gold, but it's an intriguing thought.Glendower lacks energy blast, eagle eye, Lloyd's beacon, protection from magic, acid stream, lightning bolt, and wizard eye.My two spellcasters already have spell level 4 out of 9, which strikes me as a lot of advancement this early in the game. This is mitigated, though, by the fact that neither clerics nor sorcerers get all of the potential spells when they achieve new levels. They get some of them, and the rest they either have to achieve as quest rewards (I got \"eagle eye\" from Nordon) or purchase from a temple or the mage's guild. The guilds in Middlegate only had a few of them.At first, I was astonished to see that Lloyd's Beacon, a powerful teleportation spell that I remember from Might & Magic VI, is only a second-level spell here! But then again, you have to find it. I suspect I'll need to get it from Lloyd himself, whose location was offered in a clue in the Middlegate dungeon: \"Lloyd, of Lloyd's Beacon fame, was last seen in Corak's Cave at 7,11.\" I have no idea where Corak's Cave is, but I'm sure this spell will be a true reward when I find it.Believe it or not, I did manage to get out of the dungeon after this. I had to resurrect 5 out of 6 characters, but I made it.My characters have died a lot, both from tough enemies (see below), but also because my useless thief (do I ever get any other kind?) keeps setting off exploding traps. Aelfric reminded me that it was important to buy a thief's pick from the shop...Item D....and I did so, but even after that, he only succeeds about half the time (which I guess makes sense given that his \"thievery\" skill is 50%. What is particularly annoying is that when you fail to disarm a trap, and it goes off, the trap remains active. It's not unusual for me to get hit three or four times by the same trap before I finally disarm it.These priests and I became bosom buddies.Still, we're making progress. I suffer full-party death in about 30% of my expeditions right now, as opposed to about 60% when I first started playing. Of course, I have yet to explore the great outdoors.3. The DungeonMy map of Middlegate dungeon.For a dungeon of only 256 squares, Middlegate sure does pack a lot in it. There were two signposts, nine messages scrawled on the walls, the golden goblet, the captive NPCs, some buried treasure, 13 secret doors, and at least 29 squares with fixed encounters. There was one small zone of darkness and one 4 x 4 anti-magic zone with an encounter in each square.An automap of the same dungeon.I insisted on mapping it even though the cartography skill creates an automap for me. I could have relied on the automap to see where I still needed to explore, and just written down the messages. I may do this eventually, but for now it's just fun creating the maps. The automap, of course, doesn't note special encounters or messages or even secret doors.The messages came in two types: 1) signposts, like this one......and 2) messages on the walls, like this one...There were nine such wall-scrawlings, and eight of them seemed to be clues of some sort. I'm going to reproduce them below because I'm sure they're germane to the main plot:\"Green interleave. One letter after another, 2-1-3-4.\" This seems to have something to do with how I arrange mysterious messages that I'll undoubtedly find in other dungeons, just like in the first game (see item 3 in this posting). \"Seek Earth Encasement at 14,1 in the proper plane. Do walk about first.\" Earth Encasement is a Level 7 cleric spell that \"encases the target in a field of earth, inflicting 40 points of damage per combat round.\"\"Win the blackest of battles, and you are halfway to an audience with Queen Lamanda.\" Lamanda is the current (failing) queen, and I suspect \"blackest of battles\" has to do with the Arena. I forgot to mention this yesterday, but the Arena is a section of Middlegate where, if you enter with a ticket, you fight some random group of monsters. The blacksmith's shop in the town sells green tickets, so I'm guessing I have to find a black ticket somewhere.Even at Level 2, the old misers weren't much of a challenge.\"The moon phase of Cron lasts 60 days.\" Duly noted, though I'm not sure where that will come in handy.\"There are only 180 days per year.\" Ditto.\"Lloyd, of Lloyd's Beacon fame, was last seen in Corak's Cave at 7,11.\" I'm sure I'll need to find him to get the spell. I don't know where Corak's Cave is yet.\"Castle Pinehurst keeps a multitude of J-26 Fluxers at 7,6.\" No idea. Something about the time travel that the manual insists I will have to engage in?\"The water disc rests at 15,0 within Castle Xabran.\" I'm not sure why I'll need the water disc, but I'm guessing there's a disc for each element.\"Lord Haart's famous ancestor, the Long One, hangs out in the 8th century in E2 at 5,4.\" Also no idea, but I'm guessing by the time I have to time-travel, I'll know why.I won't reprint all the dungeon messages as I play the game, but this gives a good sense of the variety. One important thing, though, for those of you thinking about playing: the messages only show up when you're facing the correct wall. There were at least two on the south side of east-west corridors--walls that you would otherwise have no reason to turn and look at. Thus, in exploring the dungeons, I have to make sure I face all four directions on each square to make sure I don't miss a clue.My only real complaint is that the messages sort of break the role-playing immersion. First, the coordinates violate the fourth wall; do the citizens of Cron really think in terms of map squares and 16 x 16 coordinates? Second, who went around writing all of these messages on the wall in the first place, and how are they so informed about the secret locations of major treasures and people?4. EnemiesMight & Magic II throws a large variety of creatures at you, almost all of them unique to the game. Part of the fun of the game--just like in NetHack--is learning all of their strengths, weaknesses, and special attacks; learning which creatures to heartily engage, and which to run from in numb horror.No way am I fleeing from a cat.I have a new hated enemy, even worse than the jugglers I mentioned yesterday: crazed dwarves. A funny thing happened when I first encountered a party of them. My blood chilled, and I immediately hit the \"run\" command, hoping to flee to safety. It was not to be:Crazed dwarves have a special attack called \"frenzy,\" which damages every single one of your party members--significantly--while simultaneously killing the dwarf. If I encounter a party of more than three of them, I might as well shut down and restart.The mystery is how I knew, instinctively, that they were bad news. I just Googled them, and they seem only to appear in this game, not the first one or any subsequent ones. My best guess is that I did play Might & Magic II once before, probably when it was new, and while I don't remember any of the plot or gameplay, I still have a knee-jerk reaction to this enemy. If you ever read a newspaper article about a bald man running away, screaming, from an LPA convention, that's probably me.Crazed dwarves aren't the only tough foe, though. You remember how I felt about sprites. Well, Might & Magic II has...drum roll...Because ordinary sprites weren't enough of a pain in the ass.Fortunately, their \"curse\" spell doesn't seem quite as effective as the regular sprites in I.We should also talk about the number of enemies. In one place in the dungeon, I rounded a corner and was faced with a cave full of bats:That's 60 creatures in one encounter. I wonder what the maximum is. I suspect I will find out.Surprisingly, I'm already making use of CTRL-A, an auto-battle command. When you hold down this key combination, every character makes his best attack (or blocks if he or she is not in attack range). It's a way to quickly deal with low-level monsters--or even with high level monsters if you want to apply brute force tactics. I would give a lot for The Bard's Tale III to have this option.5. GearIn my review of the first game, I gave it a high score in the \"equipment\" category for the wide variety of stuff you could find, use, and wield. It just gets better in II. First, with eight characters to outfit, almost every major encounter yields an equipment upgrade.Some of the weapons have spells attached to them. My archer is currently equipped with a \"voltage bow,\" which not only shoots some damaging arrows but also casts the \"lightning bolt\" spell.Technically, though, it should be an Amperage Bow.There are also a lot of bits of equipment that cast a single spell. Magic herbs to increase spell points, healing herbs to restore hit points, flares to take the place of the \"light\" spell, rope & hooks to move you forward one square like the \"jump\" spell, attribute-boosting potions, sextants to stand in for \"location,\" and so on. My only complaint is that these items don't work in anti-magic zones any more than spells do.Unlike many games, the blacksmith's shop continues to be useful after Level 1. In addition to the generic selection of low-level gear that he sells, there's an option for \"today's specials,\" with five items that change every day. Sometimes they're slings and short swords, but sometimes he has +4 weapons and armor. You can never tell.It says a lot about the game that I can get this much material out of a single 256-square dungeon crawl. The Might & Magic games are just packed with stuff. Practically ever corridor has a clue, a special encounter, or a quest item. Every house in the city has a quest, or a skill to learn, or an NPC, or some other reason for the house to exist. Again, contrast this to The Bard's Tale games, which have dozens of houses, only about four of which have anything interesting in them. You never feel like you're just slogging along in Might & Magic; you're always finding interesting things.Onward to the next city!"}, {"title": "Game 53: Might and Magic: Book Two - Gates to Another World (1988)", "date": "Saturday, March 26, 2011", "text": "This game opens with a screen showing a pegasus munching grass while a thief peers out from a thicket.

When I finished Might & Magic I last July, and gave it my highest final rating of any CRPG so far (the record still holds), its sequel was only about 15 games ahead on Wikipedia's chronology of CRPGs. I expected I'd be there in a couple of months. But then Arcanum pointed out that Wikipedia's list sucked, and I engaged in a series of \"backtracking\" postings while supplementing Wikipedia's list with other sources like MobyGames. By the time I was done, I had nearly 40 games between I and II. I'm glad to be there at last.With all the buildup I've been giving to this game, I was afraid it might suck. (If I ever played it before, it was a long time ago, and I don't remember it at all.) I'm happy to report that it does not. It's everything that Might & Magic I was, and at least a little bit more.The Back StoryMight & Magic II takes place on the World of Cron, which, like VARN before it, has a variety of terrains, cities and ruins. Notably different is the existence of four elemental plains in the corners of the world, which we will come to in a moment.A map of Cron. Note that it is arranged in 20 map areas--five columns and four rows.It's impossible to start this game without remembering how, at the end of the first game, the world of VARN turned out to be a spaceship-cum-biosphere run by some advanced beings with computers. VARN stood for \"Vehicular Astropod Research Nacelle,\" and by completing the main quest, the party was given a \"new assignment at the gates to another world.\"\"Cron\" being that other world, one might assume that it's really CRON--an acronym for something like Cosmic Roving Orbital Nacelle. And I presume that the party that starts the game is supposed to be the same party from the first game, although I've long since lost the save file and and had to start over with new characters.The manual contains a fairly long backstory divided into two parts. The first tells the story of the archmage Corak the Mysterious, in the form of a journal written by his apprentice, Gwyndon. Gwyndon is a bit clueless, but the summary of the story is that Corak discovered that Sheltem, \"an alien criminal from another reality\" (and the villain of the first game)...This guy....had escaped from some prison and found his wan to Cron. Corak teleports himself all over the place trying to catch him and ultimately ends up disappearing completely. Given cryptic references to Corak all over the first game, one suspects he tailed Sheltem to VARN and either died there or was imprisoned. I didn't get to kill Sheltem in I (see this posting for more), so I suppose it's possible he returned to Cron, although the book leaves it open-ended.The second part of the story tells of the creation of Cron, starting when \"an ethereal substance capable of supporting life\" arose in the void. The first living beings were elemental lords of great power: Acwalandar (water), Shalwend (air), Pyrannaste (fire), and Gralkor (earth), who warred with each other and accidentally ended up creating the physical world. While the elementals fought, humanoids arrived on Cron (their origin left mysterious), bringing magic with them. The elementals sought to destroy them, but the humanoids created an Orb of Power held by four talons that could control the four elements. A human wizard named Kalohn used the orb to defeat the four elemental lords in battle and banish them to barriers in the four corners of the world. Kalohn became king.Acwalandar took his revenge by studying magic and creating the first dragon, \"a creature of mindless destruction and incredible strength.\" The dragon and Kalohn killed each other in battle, and the Orb was lost in the Quagmire of Doom. With Kalohn slain and his ineffective daughter Lamanda on the throne, Cron's society descended into a dark age with monsters roaming the lands. Enter the party.I wonder if the game will reveal if the story is metaphorical or literal and, either way, how the elemental lords square with the likelihood that Cron is, in fact, another spaceship. In any event, the party begins in the town of Middlegate without much direction or explanation--just like in the first game. When you take your first step, the ghost of Corak appears and offers some general encouragement but no real advice.So I guess Corak is dead, then.GameplayThe basic gameplay is unchanged from I: it is a turn-based, multi-character, first-person game in which all commands are entered via the keyboard. What has changed a bit is the main adventure screen. \"O\" and \"P\" toggle between a list of commands (as in I) and the currently active spells. You also get an automatic clock and compass.The results of the \"location\" spell or the automap.All of the game maps are 16 x 16 (I didn't cheat; the manual says this) as in the first game. But new to this game is an automapping feature that activates if at least one of the characters has the \"cartography\" skill (see below). I don't know how I feel about it. I really like making my own maps. I can see where it might come in handy at points, though. The \"clairvoyance\" spell, which puts a little automap in the upper-right corner of the game screen, helps ensure that I haven't missed any steps while I'm mapping (I don't have the spell yet, but there's a fountain near the first inn that casts it for you).The graphics are much improved, well past the point at which they're acceptable to me, but the sound remains mired in the infrequent, bloop-ish age, and I could only take it for a few minutes.As you move about, you can adopt one of four dispositions: inconspicuous, average, aggressive, and \"thrill seeker.\" This affects the frequency of random encounters.CharactersYou can have up to eight characters, although at least two of them must  be NPCs that you find after the game begins. The races are the same as  in the first game: human, elf, dwarf, gnome, and half-orc.In addition to I's character classes (knight, paladin, sorcerer, cleric, archer, and robber), there are two new classes: ninja and barbarian. Ninjas sound very useful, with an automatic chance of assassination in each attack, and they can disarm traps and unlock doors like robbers (although apparently not quite as well). In contrast, it's hard to see the benefits of barbarians, who have weapon and armor restrictions and are balanced only by slightly more hit points.Nothing's changed in the list of attributes--in fact, I don't think these change throughout the entire Might & Magic series. During character creation, you can re-roll to your heart's content and also swap statistics among attributes.That has to be the worst image of a hand I've ever seen.Finally, you choose sex and alignment (good, neutral, evil) and set your name. Overall, the game is one of the most detailed when it comes to character creation.Remembering the advantages of speed for all characters except the healer in the original game, I gave that attribute high priority. I also made the characters all \"good.\" I don't know if the game has the same types of puzzles as I, but in the first game a mixed-alignment group was a disadvantage. I briefly entertained the idea of trying something like an all-paladin party but ultimately decided to save that for a game I was already familiar with.This was my final party:Bolingbroc, a male human paladinValstaff, a female half-orc knightMortemar, a male gnome ninjaQuickly, a female elf archerPeta, a female dwarf cleric. I deliberately gave her low speed so she could go last in combat and heal anyone damaged that round.Glendower, a male elf sorcerer.Also new in II is a skill system reminiscent of Shard of Spring and Demon's Winter. Each character can have two \"secondary skills\" that you purchase from trainers.For 2000 gold, I expect to be taught by Tenzing Norgay.Some of the skills sound somewhat mandatory for exploration, including mountaineering, pathfinding, navigation, and cartography (the trainer for this is named \"Otto Mapper\"). Others simply boost statistics, like gambling and linguistics. Either way, it's a binary thing: you have the skill or you don't. The skills include designations that would become class upgrades in later Might & Magic games (crusader, hero), and some to which VI-VIII would assign points and skill levels (diplomacy, arms mastery). It's fun to see the franchise feeling its way forward here.Setting OutI began in Middlegate. My starting characters had only small weapons (clubs and knives) and no gold. I started mapping the town. Within moments, I had entered the house of a wizard named Nordon, who gave me a quest to recover a goblet from goblins in the caves beneath the city.My adventurers, being neophytes, accept a vague promise of \"numerous rewards.\"Nordon had a closet in his house, ominously labeled \"skeleton closet,\" whose trapped door decimated my hit points. Inside was, quite predictably, a large group of skeletons.The skeletons finished the job that the trap had started. Within 60 seconds of beginning my first expedition in Might & Magic II, I had suffered my first full-party death:Some CRPG expert, huh?But even this brief unsuccessful endeavor taught me some important things about the game:There are going to be side quests. I loved this part about the first game, and really no other CRPG in this era has offered side quests.The game is going to have Might & Magic I's difficulty. I was partly worried that they might water it down.Monster parties are bigger. In the first game, there were never more monsters than could be listed on the screen. This game allows the monsters to scroll off the bottom of the screen. I wonder if that means that only the visible monsters will be affected by group-effect spells.Just like the first game, each town probably has a dungeon beneath it.Still, I reloaded of course and managed to map the town. A few other things I discovered:The difficulty of the game seems to assume that you've brought characters from Might & Magic I. I died a lot in my exploration of Middlegate. My luck seemed to be that I defeated enemies that dropped no gold and died every time I faced an enemy with gold, so it was a couple hours before I finally had enough to buy some decent equipment.Sorcerers don't automatically get all of the spells at each level. Some, they have to purchase from the mage's guild.Nordon has a female counterpart at the other end of town named Nordonna who just yells \"get out!\" when I show up.My ninja actually sucked at lockpicking and trap-disarming. The third time he blew up the party, I dumped him for a robber named Hotspur. He didn't turn out to be a lot better.One of the monsters you can fight is a \"cripple.\" That just seems mean.The adventuring party runs afoul of the ADA.There are other monsters unique to this game. Some monster names from the first town include: greedy snitches (steal food), inept wizards (true to their name), sewer rats, burglars and muggers (steal gold), and brain eaters (cast sleep).There's a \"brain wiping\" store that makes you \"forget\" your secondary skills, for a fee, I guess so you can choose different ones in case you decide you chose poorly the first time around.Once I was strong enough to survive them, the skeletons that killed me turned out to be a reliable source of experience and gold.Like the first game, all of the squares of a 16 x 16 map are used. If you find yourself walled off, it's a sure sign of a secret door.The tavern, which served up a variety of food and drink specials, included a rumor that said \"children at 0,15.\" I'm not sure what this is talking about, since those coordinates seem to be the cartography trainer.I already have my most hated enemies--worse than the sprites in Might & Magic: jugglers. These clown-looking monsters \"juggle\" your party, rearranging the order, and doing significant damage in the process. More than once while exploring Middlegate, they wiped out my party.These guys are on my list.Eventually, I got up to Level 3 and, as I reluctantly sign off for the night, I am poised to tackle Middlegate's dungeon and solve the first quest. I hope this one keeps me occupied for a good long while."}, {"title": "MAG: Won!*", "date": "Friday, March 25, 2011", "text": "The \"frakola\" reference escapes me. Googling turns up some users on ebay and Dungeons & Dragons online.First off, no congratulations. That asterisk next to the word \"won!\" means I cheated. I'm convinced I could have beaten the game fair-and-square given a little patience--the game is quite notably easier than Rogue--but with Might & Magic II on the horizon, patience is a distant fantasy. My cheating was of the simple type: I backed up saved games and reloaded when I died. While my rules say \"no cheating,\" I'm going to allow it occasionally when it's clear to me that I won't keep playing otherwise, and I just want to see what the end looks like.The basic gameplay didn't change. The dungeon turned out to have 25 levels, and the first 24 were randomly generated. The monsters got harder, and I should have mentioned that many of the monsters in MAG are unique to the game, including:Kleptums, which steal your items and vanish, forcing you to chase them around the dungeon level (much like leprechauns in NetHack)Reapers, which, unlike their benign counterparts in Ultima IV, \"slice experience levels\" from you. God, I hate that.Polymorphers, who turn themselves into different monsters (with the associated powers) but who can also turn you into a different creature for a few turns.Fortunately, this is sometimes awesome.The game also has, much like its siblings, a gallery of monsters that can confuse you or sap your strength.As I said yesterday, though, Mike made it a little easier than other roguelikes. In addition to the characteristics I identified in my first MAG posting, I discovered that strength drains are not permanent, there are only a few scrolls and potions that harm your character (and these are not permanent either). Sometimes scrolls don't disappear when you use them, so you might get multiple weapon or armor enchantments out of a single scroll. Hit point regeneration is fairly rapid, so you can often just run away from enemies. Even though they follow, you quickly heal, and then you can turn around and wallop them when you're feeling hale. An easy strategy is to lead the enemy back to a set of stairs, go up (they don't follow), pass the time and heal, and then head back down to strike a few blows. Repeat as necessary. This was the only way I could defeat blue dragons starting on Level 20.The maximum experience level in the game is 20; I only achieved 11. Probably the only way to win the game fair is to level grind up to 20 before you hit dungeon Level 20 and start having to face dragons.On Level 25, through a maze, I found a dragon kingdom, with an \"imperial dragon\" sitting on a throne, another roaming the room, plus other assorted bad guys, including a lich, a hill giant, and two white dragons.I would never have survived this area, not even with running, not even with saving and reloading, except that I had two potions of invisibility. All I had to do was quaff one and chuck stuff at the imperial dragon until he got pissed and got off his throne. Then I ran up and stole the Sudbury Sapphire.After that, just like Rogue, it was an easy matter to run from stairway to stairway and get out of the dungeon, at which point I got the message at the top of this posting.Incidentally, the famed \"pools of vomit\" were, I guess, these little squiggles:My guy looks awfully happy for someone surrounded by vomit.I didn't realize they were supposed to be vomit until I accidentally overate and hurled a combination of beef jerky and stale bread. Why there's so much vomit lying around dungeons, I have no idea.As for the GIMLET, it's going to be similar to Rogue. The game world gets a 1 because there hardly is one; most roguelikes aren't big on back story. There's barely any character development and no choices to make during creation (1). There are no NPCs (0). Encounters and magic and combat are traditional roguelikes, without much complexity (3 each), although some of the monsters are unique. Like Rogue, it excels in the variety of equipment that you can find, and how it makes identifying the equipment part of the challenge of the game (5), but there are no stores and no economy (0); all the gold you find just adds to your final score. The one quest is clear but very basic, livened only by the presence of the dragon kingdom at the end (2), in contrast to Rogue, which just has the Amulet of Yendor appear in a random place. The graphics, sound, and controls are good for the roguelike genre (5), and the gameplay is brisk. Call me a wimp, but I like that it's slightly easier than Rogue. The ability to retreat up levels and the relatively lesser risk of starvation are pluses in my book (6).The final rating of 26 puts it slightly higher than Rogue but not extremely high. It would be tough for most roguelikes to achieve a particularly high score on my GIMLET scale because they often lack elements of CRPGs, like NPCs and stores. (NetHack is an exception, obviously, as are some modern roguelikes.)I really have to hand it to Mike Teixeira. This would be a great game to introduce players to the concept of roguelikes without being as punishingly difficult as Rogue or as complicated as NetHack. Both of my e-mails to him bounced back. I hope he stumbles upon this blog someday so I can send him his $10.Okay, let's talk about the next game. I had it listed as Mars Saga, but as some of you have pointed out in the comments, the original Mars Saga was never released for DOS, only the Commodore 64 and the Apple II. MobyGames lists it as having a DOS released, but the DOS release from 1989 was titled Mines of Titan. According to the Wikipedia entry on the game, in the DOS entry, \"the game was completely fleshed out...[and] the setting of the game was moved from Mars to Titan, a moon of Saturn.\" It also notes there are plot differences and additional side quests. Despite MobyGames's ruling, all of these changes strike me as a fundamentally different game, not simply a \"DOS version\" of Mars Saga.Thus, Mars Saga is removed, Mines of Titan gets kicked down to the 1989 list, and the next game becomes...Might & Magic II. It's going to be a good weekend."}, {"title": "Game 52: MAG: A Dungeon Adventuring Game (1988)", "date": "Wednesday, March 23, 2011", "text": "At first glance, Mike's Adventure Game (which I will abbreviate MAG from now on) is the same game as Rogue (reviewed here), although you're trying to find the Sudbury Sapphire instead of the Amulet of Yendor. Check out these two screen shots, the top from MAG and the bottom from Rogue, and tell me if you see any real difference.The textures are virtually identical. The games are the same in that you do not pick a particular class, and your attributes are only hit points and strength. Levels are randomly generated. You kill monsters represented by letters, you find unidentified potions, scrolls, and rings, and so on. There are secret doors that you have to search for, and traps that put you to sleep, teleport you, and hold you in place for a time. You can find riches, but there are no stores in which to spend them--they just add to your overall score. Like Rogue, it deletes your saved game when you reload, meaning that death is permanent.And yet your fame lives on.Away from the surface, though, MAG has a number of innovations that distinguish it from Rogue and make it more of a transition between Rogue and NetHack. Though perhaps the game is simply derivative of Hack, which was also such a transition. I didn't play it. In any event, here are the new features I've found:Doors are sometimes stuck or require a key (found at other parts on the level) to open. Enemies can set off traps, and if they do, you hear the sounds of it in the distance.Like the nymphs in NetHack, there are fairies that steal your stuff.But there are also scrolls of genocide!No more stealing my stuff.I don't remember rings of resurrection in Rogue, although they may have been there. If you're wearing one when you die, you automatically get resurrected, although with no equipment, so you're very likely to just die again. If you see a torch on the wall, you can light it or extinguish it.The developer also seems to have made the game slightly easier. The monsters respawn on each level, though not quite so rapidly. You need food and get hungry, but you find a lot more food than I remember in Rogue and you don't get hungry quite as fast. Unlike Rogue (but like NetHack), you can backtrack to previous levels. Monsters are more likely to drop food, so you can stay on a low level and grind for a while without worrying about starvation.That doesn't mean the game is \"easy,\" though. It is a roguelike, after all. Like most of them, escaping from battle is virtually impossible once engaged, and this screen appears frequently:Nonetheless, in the first few hours I played the game, I managed to get a character (my sixth, I think) to Level 10 without dying, and the game notes seem to suggest that the Sapphire appears on Level 20 or so.I'll give it at least six hours, but it's not yielding so many innovations over Rogue and other roguelikes that it's worth too much time. It's worth the $10 that developer Mike Teixeira asked for in 1988. The version I downloaded had a small instruction guide from Mike with two e-mail addresses, so he must have re-released the game after 1988; I'll see if he's available at either."}, {"title": "Journey: The Quest Ends", "date": "Tuesday, March 22, 2011", "text": "As far as I got.Wow, was I cocky two days ago, thinking I would win Journey: The Quest Begins that same night. The game lured me into a false sense of security, though. The early puzzles were really easy. Later ones...well, I should have realized that this is the same company that made Zork.The difficulty of the puzzles doesn't bother me so much as the linearity of the game. You need to do specific things in a specific order, and the game doesn't bother to tell you when you screw up. About an hour later, you realize you were supposed to explore that nymph cave more thoroughly, and you missed a key item. Helm talked about this yesterday. I went through a lot of \"walking dead\" moments before I finally found one I couldn't defeat and gave up.Losing Hurth apparently broke the game, but I didn't know it at the time.At first, I thought the game was a lot like Beyond Zork, with the ability to use multiple means to solve the same puzzle. But later I realized the game is deceptive in that way. If you use a spell to solve a puzzle when you didn't need a spell, for instance, you are liable to find yourself lacking crucial reagents at a later date. (This ultimately sunk me.) Beyond Zork gave you greater freedom of movement throughout the game world and more freedom to make mistakes.To take an example, early in the game you are given the choice between a right and left path at a fork. If you take the left fork, you run into some bandits, but you can prepare yourself for the combat and come out well. Nonetheless, you much later realize that by not taking the right fork, you missed out an a crucial bag of spellcasting elements as well as the solution to one of the game's mysteries. In that sense, the game's \"choices\" are all mirages. You either have to keep reloading or save the game at every crucial branch so you can reload when it becomes clear you did something wrong.The party loses.Here's another example. At one point in the game, if you ask a dwarf named Hurth to tell you a story about the elves, you learn a few Elvish words. Shortly thereafter, you encounter an elf whose support you need to get a magic amulet. In order to convince her you're a friend, you have to say some of the words you learned. But if you misspell them--even capitalization--she runs off and you don't get the amulet. Beyond Zork wouldn't have had such dire consequences for misspelling a word.The game also lacks the sense of humor of most Infocom games. At times, I tried to cast spells or use objects in unusual ways. The Zork series would have eaten it up. For instance, there's this one episode where some elves' trees catch on fire. The only way to solve the puzzle is to cast the \"rain\" spell to put out the fire (which in turn depends on having stopped at a river to collect water essence in the middle of a storm).Zork would have had a field day with this. Cast \"Wind\" and the fire grows worse. Cast \"Elevation\" and you levitate one of your party members in the flames. Cast \"Mud\" and the elves get stuck while the fire surrounds them. Cast \"Lightning\" and just exacerbate the situation. You'd have a humorous account of just how and why and how badly you screwed up before you died. Journey just says that your wizard couldn't figure out \"how it could possibly help.\" Laaaaame.I solved a lot of the puzzles through brute force. Since there are a limited number of options at any given moment, you can usually keep trying various spell and action combinations until something works, then reload and do it for real. And yes, I did break my \"no reloading\" rule eventually, because I was sick of starting the game completely over from scratch just because I made one bad decision. The game is merciless. At one point, you find yourself at a tower and you can go up or down. If you go down, you find a chest of jewels with no obvious function. For reasons that escape my understanding, you have to mix some powder with some fire essence and cast a spell on the chest to find a particular gem. That's hard enough, but what makes it even harder is that if you leave the room to go explore elsewhere, the game doesn't let you get back to it again.Nonetheless, I persevered through a couple dozen puzzles, solving each the best I could, maximizing my conservation of reagents and only using spells when they were the only option. Then I got to what I think (actually, a walkthrough confirmed) was pretty much one step from the end of the game, and I didn't have enough \"wind essence.\" I don't know where I could have saved any, but there it is. I'm not starting over again.This isn't even remotely a CRPG, so I have no idea why I played it as long as I did. The writing was good and the story decent and the puzzles were interesting, but a good game gives you more options for solving them and is less obnoxious about ensuring that an extra spell cast in the first five minutes keeps you from winning in the last five. Maybe this is par for the course in \"adventure games,\" but I'm not an Adventure Game Addict. Might & Magic II is coming up, so let's plow on forward.***A long time later--more than 8 years--I did return to the game and win it.

This was, in fact, the last Infocom game, and only the second I'm playing as part of this blog. The first was Beyond Zork.Journey shows Infocom's dedication to quality prose. I don't know who they had as writers for their text adventures, but they were good at their craft. More important, the company recognized that good writing was the very key to a \"text adventure.\" If you're going to be mostly staring at text for 13 hours, you want to make it gripping. But reading on screen is a different experience than reading a book, and the text also has to be concise.The game is not really a CRPG, and it doesn't seem to contain all of the three elements I outlined yesterday. There are no attributes, no hit points, no levels or experience. There is some non-puzzle-based inventory, in the form of spell reagents, but the spells themselves are generally puzzle-based. Journey is an adventure game, and the only reason I could think that someone at MobyGames tagged it as a CRPG is that you have multiple characters and a basic inventory. The game lets you buy things but doesn't even bother to tell you how much gold you have! Nonetheless, I'm going to play it for one posting given my fondness for Infocom's previous work.The backstory: the characters come from a medieval village that has experienced five years of fouled water and failing crops. On the brink of starvation, the village has sent a party of four warriors across the mountains to beg help from a powerful wizard. Unfortunately, they never returned, and so the village convened a second party--a ragtag bunch composed of a carpenter (Bergon), an apprentice wizard (Praxix), a doctor (Esher), and an apprentice food merchant (Tag, though you can change the name) to try again. The story is told in the past tense from Tag's point of view.The game uses an innovative but simple interface in which you choose from a list of available commands for each character at the bottom of the screen. As you do, the upper right portion (the largest) narrates the result. Even simple commands like checking inventory are fully narrated in prose.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I decided to play the first game \"badly,\" choosing what seemed like idiotic options just to see how quickly I could make it end. This was the basic sequence of events:Stopped in the Village of Lavos on the first day. The party made some noise about buying food or visiting the tavern for news, but I just chose to blow on through. (In doing so, I missed the opportunity to recruit a fifth party member.)Note how the image corresponds with the text.Came to a fork in the path. Took the left road and was set upon by bandits at night. Esher the physician died immediately. (If I had brought the character from Lavos, he would have warned me about the bandits.) Tried to parley with them to no avail. Fought them off and was surprised when Minar (who I was suppose to have picked up in Lavos) approached me on the path and joined me. Apparently, the game helps protect you against completely missed opportunities. I told him to get lost.Combat is based on command selections and not tactics or statistics.Kept following the mountain path and ignored opportunities to detour. Came to the Old Forest and then a river. Gathered materials to build a raft and launched it. Kept paddling downstream until we came to a waterfall. Tried to cross the river at that point but ended up tumbling down the waterfall.  Had to climb back up to get out of the basin. Built another raft and crossed the river.The village begins to regret sending this party...Arrived at Sunrise Mountain. Started following the path up but it forked so many times that the adventurers got hopelessly lost, fought among themselves, and eventually gave up (I think I needed a map from the store in Lavos).When you \"lose\" the game, Tag gives you some \"musings\" about the experience that give hints for playing it more successfully next time. Among the ones I got were: should have had a map of the mountain, should have been more cautious crossing the river, should have taken Minar, shouldn't have been surprised by bandits.Bergon gets advice from his party members.Before I play the game for \"real,\" let me note some other features of the interface. There are some commands that the characters almost always have. Bergon can \"get advice\" from his party at various points, Praxix the wizard/scholar can \"cast\" a spell or \"examine\" either his inventory or things in the area, Minar can \"scout,\" and Tag can view or drop inventory items. Occasionally, Praxix also has the option to \"Tell Legend\" which fills you in about the game world's story.This came shortly after I rescued a party member from nymphs.Praxix also has a number of spells at his disposal, most of which are the solution to some puzzle or another. The \"Glow\" spell was necessary to find my way through a cave, for instance. Other spells could be used in combat to end it more quickly and without losing a party member.I just hope I get to cast the \"mud\" spell at some point.There isn't much else to tell you about the game except how the story goes and how it ends. Fortunately, the game gives the option to run a script of your adventure. I'll post it tomorrow with some comments.Before I sign off, though, let me just cover two highlights. First, take a look at this picture, which occurs while my party is trying to cross through an underground dwarf kingdom on the way to a tower:Doesn't that look pretty much exactly like the path to Khazad-d\u00fbm in The Fellowship of the Ring? (Albeit with the party approaching from the other direction.) It seems unlikely that Peter Jackson's animators were aware of Journey: the Quest Begins, so I can only imagine that both this image and the model were adapted from some other Lord of the Rings source (this game is full of borrowings from LOTR--more to come tomorrow) or else it's just a coincidence.Second--and this is big--according to Infocom's own text adventure, grues are the same thing as orcs and goblins! Check it out:This is monumental, and yet no one else online seems to have noticed this. Frankly, it's hard to believe this is canon. I've always thought of a grue as a wormish creature, and the Wikipedia entry on grues notes that some Infocom games describe them as beasts with fangs and fur.I suppose the latter description doesn't rule out orcs, though. In fact, one day we need to have a talk about exactly what an \"orc\" is; for such a ubiquitous foe, each game seems to treat him very differently. For this game, though, orc=grue. Keep a torch handy."}, {"title": "Game 50: War in Middle Earth (1988)", "date": "Saturday, March 19, 2011", "text": "War in Middle EarthUnited StatesMelbourne House (UK developer and publisher); Synergistic Software (U.S. developer and publisher)Synergistic version released in 1988 or 1989 for Amiga, Apple IIGS, Atari ST, and DOSMelbourne House version released in 1989 for Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MSX, and ZX SpectrumDate Started: 11 March 2011\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Edit: Maybe don't read this entry. I revisited the game nearly 10 years later and wrote a much better entry about it. This one will probably satisfy no one.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Before describing War in Middle Earth, I should probably justify its inclusion in this blog at all, because some of you have said it's not a CRPG, and indeed I don't think it is. After claiming that I was following a Wikipedia list for over a year, I have finally updated my \"rule\" to reflect that the CRPG list comes from several sources. I have erred on the side of inclusion rather than exclusion--if someone reasonably authoritative thinks it's a CRPG, it will be on my list.A couple of times I have arrived at a game, played it for a few minutes, and rejected it as a CRPG immediately. Dracula in London was a recent example. Finally, after thinking it over, I decided to set the following rule: no matter who thinks the game is a CRPG, if it does not have at least two of the following three core elements, I can skip it:Non-puzzle-based inventories. This means that you have to be able to find and carry things that aren't necessary to solve a puzzle, like swords and potions and such. Adventure games have inventories, but the items are meant to solve puzzles, so they don't count.Character leveling and development. This refers to the accumulation of experience points, the ability to increase attributes, or other types of character improvement other than better inventories.Combat based at least partly on attribute-derived statistics. Whether you connect with your opponent, how much damage you do, whether you avoid your opponent's attack, and how much damage you take should be based on numbers attached to your attributes, not simply on your chosen weapon and on how fast you click the mouse.This rule gives a better framework for deciding whether a site like MobyGames got it right, and it makes my decision to reject a CRPG less arbitrary. Frankly, I just didn't like the look of Dracula in London, but that shouldn't be an excuse to violate my six-hour rule unless I have something else to base it on. Also, from now on I will periodically do a \"rejected\" posting in which I explain which games I rejected and give you a chance to defend them as CRPGs. I can still break the rules in favor of inclusion (Pirates! had none of these elements) but not in favor of exclusion. Got it?(Anyone who thinks, \"Hey, man, it's just a game. Do you have to have so many rules? Can't you just relax and play what games you want?\" needs to spend more time pondering the consequences of giving too much leeway to an addict.)These rules will mean that a lot of games that are primarily some other category--adventure, simulation, strategy--will appear in this blog if they have sufficient \"RPG elements.\" This is fine with me. I'm not interested in being pedantic about what constitutes an RPG. And I still have my six-hour rule if it turns out I don't like it.That brings us to War in Middle Earth, which is listed everywhere but the title screen as  J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth. I already don't like it, but I can't dismiss it out of hand because it has one of my elements (probability-based combat) and may have another (inventories, although just barely). In the game, you control the various \"good\" characters in The Lord of the Rings, who are collectively attempting to get the ring to Mount Doom while Sauron's forces are trying to seize it and take it to the fortress of Barad-Dur. Secondary objectives revolve around retaining certain key strongholds.You control the game at three levels. The first is the full map level, where you can see all the forces arrayed throughout Middle Earth. This was actually somewhat interesting to me because I've watched the movies but never read the books (oh, all of you calm down), so I was never very clear how the different kingdoms were arrayed.Just out of curiosity, why couldn't the Fellowship go around the mountains surrounding Mordor? Judging by the map, it would only add another 30% or so to the journey.The second level is the campaign level, in which you control armies and give orders. You start with the ability to control the party of hobbits, and later you get several armies of Rohirim, and some armies in Gondor.\u00a0 The lowest level is the \"animation level,\" where you can control some individual characters, including the ability to talk to NPCs (although it appears that only they can initiate conversations) and pick up and use items.A healing draught?! I'm glad you told me! I was about to waste my time destroying the ring and saving the world.Now let me tell you why I don't like this game. First, I tend not to like games based on the plots of movies and books. Either one of two things happens: the game follows the plot too closely, and you just feel like you're riding a track from beginning to end, or the game diverges from the plot, and you experience a kind-of geek dissonance. For instance, War in Middle Earth starts with three pathetically-animated, identical-looking hobbits trudging down the road: Frodo, Sam, and Pippin.\u00a0 What happened to Merry? Who knows. A better question: if you had to pick one of the two, could you pick the one not prone to starting cooking fires when you're supposed to be hiding, making a lot of noise when you're supposed to be sneaking through a ruin, or screwing around with a palantir after Gandalf explicitly instructs him not to? Merry's addicted to heroin, granted, but at least he can hold a sword.Similar problems: Isengard already has armies of Uruk-hai as Frodo and his band set out, Frodo can die but another character can become the ring-bearer and solve the quest, you can move armies to places they don't appear in the book, and so on.Second, there isn't much you can do in the game. Even at the animation level, you basically just watch your characters walk along. You can't direct them individually, or force them to stop and talk to an NPC, or whatever. At the campaign level, you have none of the options of other strategy games, in which the fun is carefully managing your resources, building armies, and so on. You just tell armies where to go and hope they win the battle when they arrive.Finally, there's an awful lot of just sitting and watching in the game--not a lot of \"playing.\" If you had more forces at your command, it might be more exciting as you tried to juggle all of their movements.\"Four ring-wraiths are behind you. Where the other five are...is clearly shown to me on the campaign map.\"The first time I played, I tried following the plot of the film as much as I could. I directed Frodo and his band to Rivendell. They evaded a few Nazgul and fell in with Aragorn at a crossroads. Then they walked and walked for ages, even with the game speed set to \"very hasty.\"Occasionally, you encounter foes, sometimes random. When that happens, you see your individual characters or armies, and you have four options: charge, engage, withdraw, and retreat. If you win, the only real benefit is that you stay alive, as there are no experience points or levels in the game.Yep, that sounds like Frodo.On the way to Rivendell, I was attacked by all nine Nazguls at once and somehow managed to defeat them all. Elrond mysteriously came charging out of Rivendell to assist. Nothing about Arwen and the magic river, but I hear those weren't in the books, either.At Rivendell, the Council met as in the books and Frodo was appointed the ring-bearer and so on. Gandalf, Boromir, Legolas, and Gimli joined the band. They ran into Bilbo, who tried to give some sort of side quest and then left the mithril shirt just lying in the middle of the road. I'm glad I noticed it.\u00a0 At this point, I directed the group to the Gap of Rohan. I don't care if \"the way south is being watched.\" It still makes more sense than going under or over a mountain.There are a couple of combats with wolves, but nothing serious. But then the group encounters a Balrog. Outdoors. In the middle of some trees. The entire party is killed, and I get a message that the third Nazgul (I thought I killed them!) appeared and took the ring.\u00a0 Then Gandalf is summoned by Galadriel (I thought he was dead!) who tells him something but I can't see it because of emulator problems, I guess. I send Gandalf on the track of the Nazgul, but apparently Gandalf needs to stop and camp now and then while the Nazgul doesn't. After a brief stop for a copy protection question......the Nazgul makes it to Barad-Dur and Sauron wins:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0If I play again, maybe I'll try to go after that healing draught first.Later edit: My second game ended almost immediately, when a Nazgul found the hobbits and killed them:The thought of Pippin facing a Nazgul alone while Frodo and Sam lie dead at his feet actually gives me a little tingle.I've decided that the game doesn't meet the criteria I outlined at the beginning of the posting because combat is not based on attributes. The only thing it has going for it is an inventory--you find potions and weapons and such along the route--which isn't enough. I would have moved on as soon as I hit six hours anyway.\u00a0Addendum from 4 December 2020: A decade later, I revisited this game and won it! ******Further Reading: Check out the other games made with Synergistic's \"World Builder\" engine: Spirit of Excalibur (1990), Vengeance of Excalibur (1991), and Conan: The Cimmerian (1991)."}, {"title": "Evets: Enod", "date": "Friday, March 18, 2011", "text": "Our heroes on Level 99 of the Evets dungeon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Evets: The Ultimate AdventureUnited StatesIndependently developed and released as sharewareReleased in 1988 for DOSDate Started:16 March 2011Date Finished: 18 March 2011Total Hours: 10Difficulty: Moderate (3/5)Final Rating: 27Raking at Time of Posting: 13/49 (27%) Ranking at game 453: 242/453 (53%)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When I first started playing Evets, I figured there must be a way to win. I also figured that there were only 25 dungeon levels, since there were 25 \"level\" files in the folder. Now I can confirm that the second assumption is untrue and I'm having a lot of doubts about the first.Long before I decided to give up, I was already violating the hell out of my rules--or, at least, the spirit behind them. The game has a few features that I figured how to exploit to avoid death and keep pressing downward through the levels. First, you can flee combat about 95% of the time. When you do, your foe remains right next to you and is liable to attack again immediately, but here's where feature #2 comes in: if you save the game and restart it, it resets all of the monsters in the dungeon. Deadly foes are now gone.The third feature was what I talked about last week: as you descend levels, the game adjusts the maximum difficulty of the monsters, not the average difficulty. Even on Level 100, I was running into parties of 3 gnomes. I was also running into parties of 16 demon lords, but I could just flee, save, and reload, and my next encounter might be with a skeleton. I didn't like cheating this way, but I would have quit otherwise--I really didn't enjoy the game that much--and I wanted to see if there was an \"end.\"The maximum difficulty of monsters, as I said, started getting harder as I descended levels. I accidentally deleted my save game at one point, so I had to restart with a new party. This time, I chose three fighters and one thief, as I never found the priest or mage to be of much use. Particularly difficult monsters were dragons, who could wipe me out with breath, medusas and gorgons, and of course level-draining bastards like wraiths and vampires. Much like Wizardry, the game would sometimes indicate that I hadn't identified my foes when I first faced them. \"Red men\" would turn out to be demons, but until I identified them, I wouldn't know what level.Aargh! We were just talking about this bull$*#&!As I mentioned, I had to save and reload frequently when I faced particularly tough enemies, but I got enough moderate and low-level enemies that I leveled up fairly rapidly--until I reached Level 7. The needed experience to reach each level seems to more than double between levels, but I hit Level 7 at 100,000 and still hadn't reached Level 8 at 210,000. This took away a lot of the game's incentive.Evets uses more symbols to represent monsters than Rogue or NetHack, going through not only the letters but also the numbers and special characters. The symbol below, for instance, represents a demon or party of demons. But the game uses the same symbol for groups of creatures (all humanoids are \"h,\" for instance), so I don't know if this thing is a single Level 1 demon or a group of nine Level 8 demons.That's a \"yen\" symbol, by the way.About Level 10, the shops--there was at least one every two levels--started selling more useful and interesting items, including magic items:I also started finding a lot of magic items on slain enemies, including enchant scrolls that increased the armor class of my items, and rings of good, neutrality, and evil--the only effect of alignment that I could see--that were unwearable by my fighters but sold for piles of money. This was good, because starting on the same level, I kept getting messages that \"it's getting very hot down here!\" and my characters would slowly lose hit points. Only when I bought rings of fire resistance for all of them did this stop.\"So take off all your clothes...\"A couple of times, the game seemed to suggest there was a puzzle or special encounter coming, as with this message:But nothing ever really materialized. It was rather disappointing. But not so much as these messages, which I started receiving around Level 20. I was sure this meant that the end of the game was near:If Evets himself was to be found anywhere, I never found him, or anything, despite exploring (I think) every crevice of Levels 20-30. Is it possible that he was a random encounter starting on this level, and I just never ran into him?The shops also started selling magic maps, which automatically mapped the levels, and rings of teleportation. I didn't realize it until about Level 20, but the teleportation rings would take you to any level you wanted, between 1 and 99. This was a bit disheartening given my previous assumption that Level 25 was the last. But not only did the ring take me to Level 99, there were stairs down to Level 100! And stairs from there down to Level 101. Maybe it never ends.There are several possibilities here:1) There is no way to \"win\" the game, only to keep improving your characters and impress your friends with the maximum level you have achieved (the game keeps telling you this when you start up).2) There is a way to win but it depends on finding a special encounter somewhere that I overlooked.3) The King of the Underworld appears as a random encounter starting on some level, and I just never encountered him.4) There is a way to win, but it is on an even lower level than 101.No matter what the case, finding the answer will take longer than I want to spend on the game. The fast pace definitely makes it addicting and it's mildly entertaining, but unless you squat for hours on low levels to build up your characters, you essentially have to constantly cheat like I did, which removes much of the fun.One thing I can say for sure: I've written more about Evets in the last three days than you'll find anywhere online. I think this is a first for my blog. And there's always a possibility that Steve Ackerman will respond to my message (there's money riding on it, SAck!) and solve the mystery.Let's do a quick GIMLET: The game world is nothing special; just a generic dungeon like any roguelike with only the flimsiest excuse for your presence (1); character creation and development is the most advanced of any roguelike I've played, lacking only the extensive selection of classes of NetHack. You have multiple ability scores, alignments, spells, and all the other trappings of a real CRPG. The ability to change your class to \"prestige\" classes like samurai and ninja is interesting (I didn't avail myself of it; it was very expensive and required minimum ability scores). But experience rewards seemed low, and as I said, it took a puzzlingly long time to level (4).So, that would be a \"no\"...There are no NPCs (0). There were many monsters, mostly standard D&D classes, mostly indistinguishable except in degrees of power. There are no scripted encounters, and enemies respawn even more rapidly than in NetHack. I didn't like that I couldn't see them coming more than a space or two away, either (2). Combat with these creatures was odd for a roguelike (which doesn't mean I'm coming down on the side of Evets being a roguelike), featuring Wizardry-style rounds with various fighting, item use, and spell options. But the magic system was a bit annoying, requiring the user to type in the full names of the spells, some of which were misspelled (\"santuary,\" \"magic missle\"), and except for the teleportation spells (which were obtainable through objects anyway), I found the magic to be fairly useless (4).There is quite a lot of equipment in the game, easily distinguishable in value, though not well described (does a \"ring of magic\" enhance the user's magic or protect against magic?).  Characters had weapons, shields, armor, helms, gauntlets, rings, brooches, and cloaks to wear, and finding the next level of magic item was fun as always (5). The economy is also quite good for a roguelike. There are many things to spend money on, including equipment, identification of found equipment, healing, resurrection, and changing classes, and you never feel like you have too much money (6).As far as I can tell, there was no main quest, and thus no quests at all (0). The graphics are roguelike graphics, which I don't fault, but there's no sound. The keyboard is very intuitive, although some of the commands (like equipping your characters) are a bit cumbersome (3). Overall gameplay is so-so. The ring of teleportation keeps it from being \"linear,\" exactly, but with no quest and no special encounters, there's no reason not to just park on Level 20, hack and slash, and pop into the shop now and then (2).Final Rating: 27. Not too bad for a shareware roguelike title. Please chime in if you know more about the game than I do.For my next game, I was supposed to play Freedom: Rebels in the Darkness, which, judging from the descriptions I'm finding online, is about a slave uprising in the American south. That's an amazing premise for a game, regardless of whether it's \"really\" a CRPG, but I can't find a DOS copy anywhere. If you have one, or know where to get one, please let me know.So it's on to Heroes of the Lance, which ties with Pool of Radiance as the first official Dungeons & Dragons game released for the PC. Whether it's really a CRPG remains to be seen. [Later edit: Or maybe it won't. I can't get it to run in DOSBox.]"}, {"title": "Evets: A Surprising Second Posting", "date": "Thursday, March 17, 2011", "text": "Leveling up is surprisingly satisfying.I didn't expect to play Evets for as long as I have, but damned if there isn't something addictive about this game. I actually feel a little guilty playing it after Rogue and NetHack. With multiple characters, the ability to reload, and no food, I feel like Babe Ruth playing t-ball.That isn't to say the game is easy. Even on the first couple of levels, I occasionally ran into monsters that slaughtered me: the latest was a party of  red dragons that wiped me out in one attack. I just don't have to create a brand new party when it happens. I mean, what, really, is the virtue of permanent death anyway? Just to prove how tough we are?If I have to be killed by something...In my last session, I made it to dungeon Level 6 and character level 7. Here are the new things that I discovered:There are special encounters in the game. Here I am bathing in a fountain that restores all my health.I think I'd frankly be suspicious of a crystal-clear fountain in the middle of a dungeon.As you descend through dungeon levels, the game seems to adjust the  difficult of the toughest encounters on that level, but not all the  encounters. You still occasionally stumble into low-level parties even  on high dungeon levels.On tougher levels, monsters begin attacking in multiple groups. I usually die in these battles.\"'Cause in sleepy London town, there's just no place for...a small flying man!\" Maybe it was just me.Every level has at least one trap door that dumps you to a lower level. If there's a way to avoid these, I haven't found it yet.There are secret doors in the game. You can't search for them, but they ultimately appear if you just hang around long enough. I don't know if the presence of a thief speeds up this discovery, but it would make sense.I also mentioned yesterday that I wasn't sure thieves actually did anything. Well, color me wrong, but the manual is horrible about explaining any of these things.You gain attribute points when you level up, just like in Demon's Winter.My priest, mysteriously, doesn't seem to have any mana. I'm not sure what that's about. He's too high level for me to want to ditch him, and he fights well, but I suppose I'll have to dump him eventually so I can have a better healer.Magic hasn't played much of a role in the game so far. But here's the neat thing: mages can equip any armor and weapons that you want, but if the armor is too heavy, they can't cast mage spells. It's like the Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition here in 1988.There's a kind of \"fog of war\" that keeps you from seeing monsters until they're right on top of you. As far as I can tell, there's no light spell or anything that ameliorates this. It's rather annoying, because monsters suddenly leap on you as you walk down a corridor. It's rather like Wizardry, where you can't see the monsters coming at all.Although there is a store every few levels, they seem to sell the same basic items: no Swords +3 as you get on lower levels, for instance. This means I have rather a lot of gold with nothing to spend it on except to identify the occasional item I pick up from fallen foes (so far nothing good but a ring of anti-stoning). I hope the game surprises me by changing that.Altogether, a surprisingly good entry for a shareware game (and I don't mean to dis' independent CRPGs, but come on, this was the 1980s). I'm surprised there isn't more about it online. I'm going to keep playing a bit to see if much more develops on the next few levels. I can't see making it all the way to Level 25, but who knows--I've made it this far, and some game called Freedom: Rebels in the Darkness doesn't exactly fill me with anticipation.Steve Ackerman gets his $10 if he writes back."}, {"title": "Game 49: Evets: The Ultimate Adventure (1988)", "date": "Wednesday, March 16, 2011", "text": "So...not an auspicious title screen.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Evets: The Ultimate AdventureUnited StatesIndependently developed and released as sharewareReleased 1988 for DOSDate Started: 16 March 2011\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Evets: The Ultimate Adventure is a game I never expected: a multi-character roguelike. Are there any others? Does being multi-character disqualify it as a \"roguelike\"? I don't know, but damned if it doesn't look like Rogue:The major difference is that the little smiley face represents a party of up to four, and when you encounter a foe (represented by little letters, just like Rogue and NetHack), the game suddenly goes all Wizardry in its combat options.How a giant spider screams anything is left up to the imagination.Evets was designed by someone named Steve Ackerman of La Habra, California, who briefly ran his own company called SAck Enterprizes. (We may thank providence he didn't have a partner named Nathan Utley.) It's a shareware game, and an opening screen solicits $10 from anyone who enjoys the game. The jury's still out on that. I had practically this entire posting written about how I can't figure out how to do anything in the game because I couldn't find a manual. I went so far as to track down one of Steve's relatives and ask him to send a message asking Steve to contact me, and then I found that the manual is in a file called Evets.MAN. Who the heck uses the MAN extension for a manual?The Evets main screen.When I saw Evets coming up on my list, before I knew anything about it, I somehow got the idea it was about some kind of cute furry creatures. Isn't that what \"Evets\" sounds like? Maybe I had Ewoks on my mind. \"Evets\" is, of course, \"Steve\" in reverse--not as bad as \"Werdna\" but I'm still tired of this trope. In the game, \"Evets\" was a powerful mage who disappeared while exploring a dungeon with a fighter named Belham. Legend has it that his ghost haunts the dungeon...or could he still be alive? Either way, the dungeon is reportedly full of treasure, so there's no lack of excuses for exploring.You create a party of up to four characters, selecting from fighter, mage, thief, and priest classes, and human, dwarf, elf, hobbit, orc, half-elf, and half-orc races. You also choose one of 10 alignments: the standard Dungeons & Dragons combinations plus an additional \"amoral\" alignment. At first I wasn't sure how that differs from \"neutral,\" but then I began to realize that a neutral character tries to achieve a certain balance, while an \"amoral\" character is simply uninterested in concepts like good, evil, order, and chaos. I like it.Character creation.I created a basic party--Cactus Jack the fighter, Sazerack the priest, Gimlet the thief, and Darkand Stormy the mage--and headed into the dungeon. As I wrapped up for the day, I was on Level 3. This is what I can report:Although there are only four classes at the beginning of the game, your characters can go up before a \"review board\" found on the first level of the dungeon, and--for lots of gold--change their classes to any of the other original classes plus four other possibilities: ninja, samurai, ranger, and monk. The manual doesn't make it clear what the advantages of these classes are, although it does mention that they get some spell points.The review board.The dungeons do not appear to be random like most roguelikes. At least, the first two levels are not.There is a rather limited number of commands while exploring. You can move, go up and down stairs, cast a spell, or use an item. There doesn't appear to be a \"search\" feature, which makes me wonder what the thief class really does, plus leads me to believe that there are no traps or secret doors.Priests and mages share the same pool of spells, but each class casts some spells easier than the other (with a lower mana cost). There are 45 spells, going up to Level 20, and your characters can cast  spells corresponding to their levels. At level 1, I have Magic Missle [sic], Shield 1, and Bless 1. There are some interesting ones, like Find Stairs, Find Shop, Level Transport, and Monster Sensing.Casting a spell in combat.The dungeons don't seem to have any items in them. There is a shop at the entrance and others on various levels.Unlike most roguelikes, the game does not delete your saved game when you reload.There doesn't seem to be any food in this game.Monsters respawn constantlyBoth spell points and mana regenerate as you move around.Combat is not quite as tactical as in Wizardry or even The Bard's Tale, but it's definitely more interesting than most roguelikes. You face multiple monsters, and sometimes multiple groups of monsters, in each combat. Each character has options to fight, cast a spell, use an item, parry, or flee. Some enemies have special attacks. You get the drill. On the other hand, each combat takes about three times as long as most roguelikes, and in some ways I miss the fast pace.Monsters get quite difficult after Level 1, and this sign is fairly common......but the ability to reload takes some of the sting away, if simultaneously making its roguelike creds a little suspect.While the idea of a multi-character roguelike is appealing, I confess to some skepticism about this game. I have yet to collect a single item from the dungeon floor or from a slain foe, I've seen nothing to suggest that race and alignment play any role in the game, and I can't imagine what use a thief is. It's as if the creator had some good ideas but never finished integrating them into the game. On the other hand, maybe the first few floors are just introductory and I'll find more encounters of interest on lower levels. I'll let you know."}, {"title": "Demon's Winter: Final Rating", "date": "Tuesday, March 15, 2011", "text": "The font I could have been looking at for the last 13 hours.

Despite the length of time it took me to finish it, it's actually a fairly short game--I probably would have covered it in two or three postings if it had been a normal month.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 It is hands-down better than Shard of Spring, and it told a more compelling story with better plot twists. But it suffered the same problems with excessive linearity, and I thought there were a few character development flaws that rendered moot some of its originality in character choices.The ending is surprisingly grim. Yes, you've managed to re-imprison Malifon, and this works out well for your party, since they all get to be kings or immortal, but Ymros has lost all its gods and towns and is now covered in permafrost. That's what passes for \"winning\" the game!Let's see how it rates.1. Game World. The world of Ymros itself is nothing special: a standard high fantasy realm populated with interchangeable towns and temples. The back story of an imprisoned demon seeking to wreak havoc on the land is also nothing new. A few times I made joking references to The Wheel of Time series; this isn't because I thought the game was copying the plot (the game predates the first book) but because the trope is so familiar. Nonetheless, it's done well, and the game is one of the only ones from this era (or indeed any era) to measurably change the game world as the plot moves forward. I made fun of how the developers gave away the plot twist in the title, but to be honest, it did come as a surprise: by the time it happened, I guess I figured it was a metaphor or something. Zink said it pretty well in a comment yesterday: \"This game...actually manages to create a feeling that $&#@ is quite definitely going down.\"On the negative side, the developers seem to have spent a lot of effort on a religious system that has no bearing on gameplay, peppering the land with temples that essentially just sit there. It was a good idea that could have been developed better. Final score: 5.There are more than a dozen of these temples for virtually no reason. Then they all get destroyed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. Character creation and development. The game gets points for the inclusion of some interesting classes (scholar, sorcerer, visionary) with unique abilities, but then loses them again by making the abilities somewhat useless. There aren't enough traps in the game to justify the thief; I barely had enough call for magic at all, let alone the sorcerer's custom spells; and the ability to see around corners doesn't help much when enemies are unavoidable no matter what you do. Still, I found the game easy enough that I wish I had picked one of the custom classes just to see what it was like.The skill system is also original--there's really nothing else like it in the era--but also somewhat poorly executed. Because the cost for acquiring skills outside your \"class\" is so high, you're effectively limited to a small selection until late in the game, when level increases have hopefully increased your intelligence. It was also needlessly difficult to acquire some of the skills. If you didn't start with Spirit Runes (which are the only really necessary spell class in the game), you have to trek all the way to the north pole to find the college. I just realized that I never found the school that teaches turn undead [Edit: turns out it wasn't a school but rather part of the priesthood skill.]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leveling is satisfying because it happens infrequently and you get attribute upgrades when it does occur. I can't forgive the game for removing the ability to level up without any warning (or even with warning; the moment experience points cease to be relevant, battles stop being fun), although this is somewhat mitigated by the relative ease of the final dungeon. [Edit: I was wrong about this, too; I just didn't find the one town that survived.]Finally, I liked that there were some class-specific encounters in one dungeon and class-specific end-game bios. Final score: 5.3. NPC Interaction. There are a couple NPCs, including the Ancient One and Eregore the high priest. Talking to them is necessary to understand the plot of the game and advance the main quest. In the second conversation, we get actual \"dialog options.\" Not the first in any CRPG, but still unusual in this era. But overall, NPCs are few and the interaction is mostly one-way. Final score: 4.4. Encounters and foes. Maybe it's just me, but only a day after playing the game, I honestly couldn't name more than four of the game's many monsters. I never saw them as more than icons to be pummeled. I know that they had different attacks, strengths, resistances, and so on, but they just  never stuck, partly because the game manual describes only a few of them, and very cursorily. There was only one encounter in which \"role-playing\" mattered, with Eregore, but that's one more than most games of the time. I really hated the lock-step regularity of combats (especially at sea), but it did help when level-grinding. The balance between regular and fixed encounters was good. Final score: 5.5. Magic and combat. Physical combat is well done, and I didn't grow as bored with it as I did in Shard,  although the game's insistence at starting your party on the other side  of the room, facing away from the enemy, was continually annoying. You  could really see the effects of high strength and speed scores in  damage, initiatives, and extra attacks. There were tactics associated  with positioning and whether to charge the enemy or wait for him to come to you.Ship combat was stupid. There were virtually no tactics, and the experience rewards were overbalanced.SSI invested a lot of time in the magic system--time that, as far as I'm concerned, was wasted. \"Heal\" and \"Resurrect\" are the only completely necessary spells. In the entire game, I only cast three or four others out of around 30 possibilities. Part of the problem is some of the area-effect spells. Some of them, like \"fire storm,\" could theoretically be useful, but the game won't let you cast them until the second round of combat. By then, your characters are usually hopelessly intermingled with the enemy, and you risk fireballing your own people. Like Shard of Spring, I like that you can choose how many spell points to invest in each casting, though. There were possession and summoning spells I didn't even attempt.Ultimately, all of the problems cited here boil down to the game being too easy. There's no reason to meticulously plot the battlefield if charging and pummeling almost always wins the day. Except for one time in which I entered a large dungeon too early, without enough food, and without having invested in quality weapons, I never felt in danger. Final score: 4.6. Equipment. Another tough one. The difficulty in identifying weapons and armor was annoying, but then again it was I that chose not to have a scholar. I didn't even mention the game's vials and salves and miscellaneous magic items because I never felt any need to explore or use them. The process of identifying items and then later remembering what they were seemed overly complicated, and none of the items are ever well-described. The redeeming factor (although this applies better to \"economy\") was being able to enchant weapons and armor. Final score: 4.7. Economy. Finding that I could spend all my money upgrading weapons and armor was a source of joy. Before that, I was using my money to pay for healing because I didn't know what else to do with it. I only wish I had discovered that dungeon earlier in the game. Its existence means that there's always a reason to get cash. Beyond that, I didn't love the process of buying and selling items. It took me hours of gameplay before I realized that merchants had multiple items; they just showed one at a time and you had to hit \"c\" to page through them. I never felt that \"haggling\" accomplished anything, and merchants bought my used stuff for a pittance. Final score: 7.Every game should have this!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8. Quests. The game has a very clear main quest, and the fact that it's only slowly revealed is part of the fun. (Only complaint: why did Malifon reveal himself and draw the attention of a group of adventurers by having one of his minions attack some dinky little backwater?) There are a couple of different endings, but the decision is at the very last minute, and you can get the alternate ending through an instant replay. There are no side quests in the game. I like that one of the endings had character-specific epilogues, though not quite enough to see how the endings would change with different classes. Final score: 5.9. Graphics, Sound, and Inputs. The graphics are tolerable but not memorable, except in a few special encounter scenes. The game notably declines to offer any nice end-game graphics, instead wrapping up with some lame flashes of light and an all-text finale. There are hardly any sounds in the game, and they're painful. The keyboard commands are intuitive and are offered in the on-screen dialogs, but the inability to move diagonally is a serious drag. I thought there were too many sub-menus; casting a healing spell requires the following sequence: (C)amp, (C)ast, (#)character, (4) for spirit runes, (F) for name of spell, type number of spell points,  hit enter, choose character to cast on. The game also had unnecessary pauses in certain places, giving you 15 seconds to read three words of text. Final score: 2.10. Gameplay. My biggest complaint is that the game is very linear while providing the illusion of being non-linear. It has a rather large game world to explore, but you really have to do the dungeons in a specific order or you can't finish them. On the plus side, I give points for the inventory puzzles which, while not complicated, are unusual in CRPGs. I did find the game a little too easy overall, but it was also paced well, with no sections that really dragged.This might be the first game that I would really call \"replayable\"--not so much that I'm compelled to do it right away, but a party consisting of the characters I didn't choose--cleric, thief, visionary, scholar, and sorcerer--would have a very different game. It would be much more tactically challenging, you'd get different epilogues, and with a cleric the religion system might take a bigger role (e.g., you frequently \"convert\" to different gods to get different advantages). Any of you who say that you want to play it, try that and tell me how it goes. I recommend focusing on intelligence and speed during character creation: you'll need a lot of non-class-specific skills, and speed is vital for initiative and number of attacks.Anyway, final score of 5 on gameplay for a final rating of 45. This is reasonably high; my median right now is 34.5. The game is strong on story but weak in logistics. I do recommend it, and if I didn't seem to enjoy it more while I was playing, it's probably because unrelated life stuff was creeping into the tone of my postings.Next up: Dracula in London turned out to be not even remotely a CRPG, and I'm having issues with Eamon, which is actually a 1980 game that only received a DOS conversion in 1988, and a buggy one at that, so it's off the list until I can get it to run. Looks like Evets: The Ultimate Adventure.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0****Further reading: Check out my coverage of this game's predecessor, Shard of Spring (1986)."}, {"title": "Demon's Winter: Won!", "date": "Monday, March 14, 2011", "text": "More than I enjoyed your font and color choices.Well, if there were any towns that survived the breaking of the Shard of Spring, I couldn't find them. (Question: when the Shard of Spring is destroyed, why does it automatically become winter? Why not autumn?) Even Pirate's Cove, which was inside a dungeon, was destroyed. This meant no more leveling for my characters, even though they probably could have gone up another one or two. Fortunately, the dwarf dungeon survived, and I took my 40,000 gold pieces there and enchanted the hell out of my weapons and armor. Nothing else to do with money. With no towns to repair my ship, I fled from every combat and still barely made it.My ranger is a little less useless.Oh, and thank the Ancient One for hunting! Without that skill, my characters would have starved to death, with nowhere to buy food. In fact, all of this seems to make the game too hard. Have I just overlooked the one surviving town?With nothing left to do, I headed for Malifon's volcanic isle. The island had a volcanic center, where Malifon lived, and three long \"arms\" sticking out from it.From Andrew Schultz's map.True to what the Ancient One had told me, walking around on the island produced a constant drain on my health. But I had to tough it out, travel to each of the three glyphs at the end of the arms, and cast the \"uncurse\" spell to open the bore.Then came an annoying 20-30 minutes when I had to wait out the day/night cycle about six times so I could sleep, heal, and regain magic points for the end. I kept getting attacked during this period, which set me back a bit. Even when fleeing ship combats, enemies sometimes got a lucky shot, and I ended the game with my ship at 2 health.Into the Dark Chapel I went and immediately encountered some wind dragons. This would be a good time to mention that late in the game I discovered a \"reorder\" option that allowed me to choose a better starting battle formation. It didn't fix the problem by which the characters were always facing the wrong way, but it did provide greater maneuverability at the initial stages of each combat.It pays to read the game manual ahead of time.I used the mirror taken from cathedral on a circle of light, and for reasons I don't fully understand, I was transported back in time 10 thousand years (before Shard of Spring, even!).The creators got a lot of mileage out of this.The game gave me another rune puzzle. A priest asked for a password that finished a sequence beginning \"power, spirit, divinity...\" Around the room were four sets of runes. I could figure out from the number of letters which runes represented which words and translating from those runes, I determined that the answer was VOID. This opened a passage to the center of the volcano.Nothing like wandering around lava.The volcano was a maze, but not a particularly difficult one. I just kept following a right-most path. There were random fights throughout, all producing heaps of experience and gold that I couldn't use. Finally, I came to a bridge where I took on two great dragons and a demon lord:Attacking a great dragon with your hands...how awesome is that?I next came to a Hall of Illusions where I traveled through pieces of previous dungeons in the game. There was one battle, possibly random, with elementals, but nothing overly difficult. Sensing the end was near, I started recording and found, to my surprise, it was very near. In fact, I went one step too far the first time and had an interesting death, then reloaded and won the game.It turns out there are three endings:1. You go too far in your wanderings, enter Malifon's chambers, and have your life snuffed out.2. You cast the imprison spell before going into the chambers and choose, when the Ancient One offers, to become immortal, guiding Ymros for eternity (\"until, in the distant future, the volcano begins to rumble\").3. You cast imprison but choose to remain mortal. The game then tells you a bit about what happens to your characters: Mathemas (paladin) becomes king of Ymros; Grendel (barbarian) spends the rest of his life fighting monsters and becomes a legend; Constans (monk) just wanders off into the mountains; Triamour (ranger) rebuilds the city of Woodhaven and retires; Clinschor (wizard) starts the quest to construct a new Shard of Spring.I rather imagined that the end would reverse the damage Malifon caused, but nope, Ymros remains locked in winter with most of its towns destroyed and all its gods dead. What was the point of going back in time?I must say, the ending feels a tad anticlimactic. I thought there would be one final, large battle before using the \"imprison\" spell, but I guess the demon lord and dragons were supposed to be the ultimate fight. My characters were in pretty good shape at the end, so apparently I was complaining needlessly earlier about the inability to level up before the endgame.A GIMLET tomorrow and then on to a series of somewhat questionable CRPGs. By the way, if you were wondering what happened to The Bard's Tale III or BattleTech, I kicked them down later on the 1988 list. They'll come back."}, {"title": "Demon's Winter: A Plot Twist You Won't Believe", "date": "Sunday, March 13, 2011", "text": "Yeah, that's gotta hurt.All right, let's jump right in. The moment I camped after getting the  Orb of Evertime, Malifon showed up in my dreams and started with some  jive-talk:This continued the next time I camped, too:Okay, so it turned out not to be jive talk, though: further explorations showed that all of the temples in Ymros had been converted to ruins. This sounds pretty dire, but since my god wasn't really doing anything for me anyway, I can't say that I'll miss him. Not to mention that when I returned to the ruined temple the Ancient One made me a god!Technically, all this did for me was to give me God Runes, which allow two spells: uncurse and imprison. The former gives me the ability to remove some glyphs that destroy anyone who tries to walk on Malifon's island. The second will allow me to re-imprison Malifon. I have to do this by--get this--going back in time to the Dawn of Man and casting the imprison spell on the volcano. The Ancient One warns that I could never hope to defeat Malifon in combat.God Runes came with 200 spell points, needed for the imprison spell, which I stupidly gave to my paladin instead of my wizard, who could have done something useful with them in the meantime. But he also got a bunch of experience points and rose two levels, so that was good.From what the Ancient One had told me, there didn't seem to be any reason not to head directly over to Malifon's volcano, which I had already found in my sea explorations. But I knew of at least three dungeons I hadn't explored yet and I figured I'd better check them out.The first, on the large empty island, turned out to be a trap-filled maze occupied by some random encounters and, at the end, a room full of dwarven blacksmiths enchanting objects. It transpired that the dwarves would enchant my weapons and armor, either by adding a + or a special power, for some pretty hefty gold. Still, this is exactly what I like to see in a CRPG: a game economy that always makes it worthwhile to collect gold.  Well done, Demon's Winter. I enchanted some stuff, and leaving the dungeon, I had a couple of encounters with giants and dragons that provided me with so much gold, I turned around and went right back in.The second \"dungeon\" turned out to be an old lady's stone hut on an island on the eastern side of the map. All I could do there was camp and sleep. The game made a show of my party being woken up in the middle of the night by a spooky noise and finding the old woman gone. I left the hut having no idea what this was about.The third one was on the same island, south of the old lady's hut, and it consisted of a series of small dungeons joined by a small outdoor area. I found a map room telling me where Malifon's prison and the Dark Cathedral are, fought some giants guarding a dock, and kept getting a message that the sun was coming up. In one room, I killed a \"bellkeeper\" and entered the Bell Room where there were some carved ancient runes:Well, damned if an early supposition of mine didn't come true. A few postings ago, I found a similar collection of runes with a translation. Using that as a Rosetta Stone, I figured out that this translation means \"RIN_ _E__ __ MI_NI____. Some of the unknown symbols were identical, so soon I had RING BELL __ MI_NIG___, which I ultimately guessed as RING BELL AT MIDNIGHT.This being a dungeon, I didn't really know what time it was, but the purpose of the old lady's hut became clear. I returned to it, slept, woke up in the middle of the night again, and hustled to the bell tower before I got \"the sun his risen\" message. When I rang it, I got a mysterious message about angels crying. It took me a while to figure out what this actually did, which was to open a gate at the southern part of the dungeon to Malifon's temple. Entering the temple, I was challenged by a guard who asked my name. Scanning my notes for names of Malifon's minions, I stupidly tried XERES first before achieving success with JESRIC. Later I had to use his heavy amulet to impersonate a high priest and get past his guard.There was another set of runes that I interpreted as: AT COMETFALL CAST THE SPELL TO BREAK MY BINDING. Pretty much the opposite of what I want to do. Soon I found a room with the binding-breaking spell, indicating that it had already been cast. Bollocks. Maybe I shouldn't have stopped off at the dwarven dungeon first.As I approached Malifon's high priest, Eregore, the Ancient One contacted me and told me that Malifon had stolen the Shard of Spring and was intending to break it.Eregore turned out to be a bit of a spaz. After I slew his minions, I had a series of dialog options with him:Each one offered me the opportunity to lie or tell the truth and reveal intelligence to Malifon. I told the truth anyway. The upside is that Eregore totally lost his cool and directly confronted Malifon (through a mirror) about whether he intended to use the Shard of Spring to destroy Ymros and thus leave nothing for Eregore to rule.Eregore committed suicide by dagger while Malifon mocked him. Malifon then spouted some verse at me and shattered the Shard of Spring. I took the mirror, hightailed it out of the dungeon, to find......the titular Demon's Winter has at last arrived. (Other SSI titles: The Elder Scrolls IV: Martin the Dragon; Starflight: The Endurium Ancients; Ultima IV: The Answer is \"Infinity.\") And with it seems to have come the destruction of (near as I can tell) every town on the face of the planet. Does this mean there's nowhere to raise levels, heal, fix my ship, and identify equipment? Because if so, that's a bit of a raw deal. I'm sure I gained enough experience for at least two levels.There were some tough battles with dragons, giants, master thieves, high-level mages, and a demon lord, but having two characters with spirit runes really  helped with the healing and resurrections. When I got done with this  island, I had some mad gold: more than 30,000 since I last visited the enchanting dwarves. I hope they're still around at least.Will the next post be the end game? It sure feels like it."}, {"title": "Demon's Winter: The Main Quest At Last", "date": "Saturday, March 12, 2011", "text": "The main quest finally surfaces.The ruined temple, which I had just entered at the end of my last posting, turned out to serve up the main quest. First, I witnessed an ancient conversation, replayed between two ghosts. One ended up sacrificing the other to his \"god,\" who was stuck in a dormant volcano. I accidentally skipped part of the conversation, but the neat thing is that the game has a \"(r)ead description\" command that lets you re-view any text you encounter; sort-of a spiritual ancestor to games that let you re-watch cut scenes.I'm sick of CRPG NPCs calling me \"fools.\"Soon I ran into Jesric of the High Temple of Malifon (the name making its appearance in-game for the first time) who said he was seeking the Demon Crystal. (Thanks, Jesric! I wouldn't have even known to look for it otherwise!) He attacked me by himself, and I was able to use my \"surround him with my four best fighters and pummel him to death\" strategy. He served up a lot of experience (1000) for not being so tough, plus a \"heavy amulet.\"If you could only attack diagonally in this game, Clinscho would have something to do.A nearby cave contained a \"prayer scroll,\" and towards the bottom of the dungeon, I found an ice door with a hole in it, which turned out to accept the icicle I had found yesterday. This teleported me to an altar room, where using the prayer scroll summoned an ancient god who gave me the main quest.Could they have been a little more descriptive about \"drawings of the creation of the universe\"?It transpires that some beings or gods called Ancients imprisoned Malifon under the mountain with a spell. The spell weakened over time, and with \"outside help\" (presumably Lanfear and the other Forsaken), the spell has been broken. Unless he is bound again, he will \"sweep Ymros clean of life.\" Fortunately, an ancient order called the White Knights created an Orb of Great Power that can channel the One Power of the Ancients and create a new binding. I needed to go get it from the Vault of the White Knights.I had done pretty poorly on my first trip to the Vault, which was only one level ago, so I decided to hang around a port town and do some level-grinding, alternating between ship combats (which give the most experience but no gold) and land combats (which give paltry experience but are the only way to get gold). The number of experience points needed to advance ended up getting so large, though (>10,000) that after a couple of hours, I had only gained one level. Fortunately, it was enough to get Fire Runes for my wizard (at last) and get one of my other characters skilled in Spirit Runes so I have two healers.A gleeman recounts my past glories.I also explored a huge continent on the western side of the map that, near as I could tell, had only a couple towns and a dungeon and otherwise mostly empty space. Like Faery Tale Adventure, the game brags about its size (\"32 times larger than Shard of Spring,\" the manual says), but like Faery Tale Adventure, I find the world to be mostly empty and boring. To be fair, the enemies change with the terrain, which would be a positive if the enemies themselves were more memorable.Returning to the Vault of the White KnightsEven though I didn't feel quite ready, my crew headed back to the Vault of the White Knights to obtain this Orb. The Vault was the largest and most interesting dungeon in the game so far. A spirit guarding the Orb of Evertime told me that I needed to pass a number of tests to prove myself worthy of it.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The tests all involved single combat for each of my five characters against a foe specific to that character. My wizard had to fight an imp, my barbarian a dragon, my monk a \"karate master,\" and so on. None of them was terribly difficult, except for the ranger, who isn't very skilled at...well, anything.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There were rooms for characters I don't have, and the spirits in those  rooms just \"let me pass.\" I'm curious what foes the game would have  provided for scholars and visionaries. At the end of the combats, the spirit let me march up and take the Orb.Except for one battle with some high-level magic users, the game didn't throw many tough combats at me, meaning my first visit must have been a fluke. I should have held to my old Might & Magic credo: wait until an area kills you three times before you declare defeat.Next up, I guess, is a trip back to the ruined temple so I can give the Orb to the ancient god.A few other miscellaneous things:The day/night cycle is starting to annoy me a bit. Every 200 moves or so, the game world closes in on you to simulate getting dark, and the game forces you to camp and sleep. Triple that number of moves would have been nicer.I just discovered today that you can flee combat. I did it accidentally, while moving a character near the edge of the screen. This will make traveling by ship a little more feasible.Of my five characters, the most useless is probably my ranger. His hunting ability became moot once I started to make money, and his vaunted \"monster lore\" ability is really pretty useless. He sucks in combat (partly because I didn't hold out for a high strength score). If I wasn't so far into the game, I'd ditch him for another monk.Presumably, this is to help you plan your battle tactics, but I haven't found much use for it.Getting the Kung-Fu skill turned my monk into a real bad-ass. Now he ends up stunning his opponent on about 30% of his hits.Enemy spellcasters keep freezing my characters, a condition that lasts permanently until you cast the \"melt\" spell, which I didn't have until after the ruined temple because I didn't save enough intelligence points to get my wizard Fire Runes. Every freezing means a trip back to a town with a healer. Another common problem is to be bound in chains, the antidote to which is a \"break bonds\" spell, but it's part of Metal Runes, which I also don't have.Final judgment: there are a random number of moves in between land battles but a fixed number in between dungeon battles.A weird buggish thing: when I enter a dungeon, only the few squares around me are visible, presumably because it's \"dark\" and the game wants me to use a torch or a \"magic torch\" spell. But if I just go into camp and exit again, everything is lit up and visible.A few times, when desperate, my monk has prayed to his god. Not once has this had any results. The game manual and all the churches in the game make a lot out of a religious system that has virtually no effect in terms of actual game play.I wish I had some idea of where I stood in terms of total game progress. In some ways, I feel like I'm just beginning, but there aren't that many dungeons on the map!One final, somewhat amusing, note: although I've done surprisingly well following my rules (especially the no spoilers rule), today I found myself exercising an obvious loophole. My rules say that I can't quit and reload just because I don't like a certain result. If a character dies in battle, I need to raise him myself, have him raised in a town, or replace him. Naturally, this is something of a pain in the neck when it happens deep in a dungeon.If my entire party dies, on the other hand, not much choice there. I need to reload. You can see where this is going. If a battle goes poorly and I lose a couple of characters, suddenly my other characters lack a certain motivation for victory. You could even say that their depression makes them distressingly suicidal. This hasn't cropped up in a lot of other games because most of them are either single-character or limited-save. In Might & Magic, when I could only save in towns, it was always worth it to haul dead characters back to a temple, lest I lose all that adventuring time. But in games where you can save every step, like Demon's Winter, the dynamic changes.In modern games, like Oblivion and Baldur's Gate, I get around the problem by forcing myself to only use auto-saves. If the last auto-save was 30 minutes ago, no way am I going through all that again just to avoid spending the 3000 gold to raise Jaheira. In this era, without auto-saves, I either have to establish a rule limiting my saves or just force myself to try to keep my party alive, no matter how convenient it would be if they all died."}, {"title": "Demon's Winter: Exploration", "date": "Thursday, March 10, 2011", "text": "My crew turns out to be a bunch of sissies.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 In my last posting, things looked pretty bleak. It turned out I underestimated my ability to escape the dungeon, heal up, and return. I noted that there's a random encounter every 43 moves, but they vary wildly in difficulty. The difficult ones killed me and caused me to reload; the easy ones I defeated and was able to save. When I got out of the dungeon, two of my characters were dead, but I was able to make my way up to the town of Woodhaven, heal, rise a level, and return. This time Xerxes fell in the first battle, and only my wizard died, costing another 900 gold to resurrect.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I was tempted to declare \"Won!\" at this point.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 As far as my characters were concerned, they had won, defeating the demon that had unleashed the kobolds on their home town. Only an old man's warning that Xerxes was just a \"puppet\" kept us from celebratory feasts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I was pretty flush with cash, so I treated myself with some weapon and armor upgrades. This would be a good time to mention that I really dislike the inventory system in this game. When you find objects, they are unidentified, and unless you have someone with the identify item skill, you have to take it to a town and pay 85 gold to get it identified. Even the identify skill doesn't much help because it only works once per day. Most of the stuff is nonmagical, meaning the identify fee is a waste of money. When you've identified a magic weapon or armor, the game doesn't change its name to something like \"short sword +2\"; instead, it puts a little * symbol next to it and you have to go into camp, view the character, page through to his equipment, then select the particular piece of equipment to see what it actually is.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Unmemorable symbols designate magic items.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At this point, I had no idea where to go next in my quest, so I started sailing around to the different islands, exploring, and getting into high-experience-winning sea battles.  I leveled up a couple of times. I finally found the college of fire runes, but they told me my wizard wasn't smart enough. That hurts.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Where I grew up, we'd kill a man for saying that.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On a large island in the northeast, I found the College of Kung-Fu and gave a boost to my monk's fighting skills. I also found the College of Spirit Runes nearby. My wizard had started with spirit runes, and I had hoped when I found it I could give the skill to some of my other characters--they all have spell points, and nothing to cast with them. Alas, none of them had the requisite intellect.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I wasn't ready for this place.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Close to the College of Spirit Runes, on a mountainous island, I found a dungeon called the Vault of the White Knights. Figuring any port in a storm, I started exploring it, and I promptly got massacred by a large party of mountain giants.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This is about as bleak as it gets.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I kept exploring west and I came across another dungeon called The Crystal Cave, \"carved out of a large glacier at the base of the mountain.\" A few steps into it, I figured I'd again stumbled into the wrong place:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 But the ice dragon turned out to be surprisingly easy. Beyond him, I found the College of Ice Runes, which I didn't need, and in another corridor of the dungeon--past an easy battle with a yeti--I found an icicle. There seems to be no place to use it in this dungeon, so I stuck it in my inventory, which is just about bursting with stuff I've picked up from various dungeons. I'm not sure what I can safely get rid of.A nearby island gave me the town of Aurora, which unfortunately doesn't have a dock; my ship is dangerously low on health, and I'm at the north pole. And a third island in the area held a ruined temple, where my party explores as I say goodnight.Hint time: was there something I was supposed to find in Qoorik that would tell me where to go next? (I left the place with a ton of equipment I never got a chance to use.) As far as I know, the main quest (the Demon's Winter) still hasn't started."}, {"title": "The Most Annoying CRPG Enemies", "date": "Wednesday, March 9, 2011", "text": "#1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I've made some progress in Demon's Winter, but not enough for a full posting. This \"special topic\" occurred to me in my Oblivion thread when I was talking about Morrowind's cliff racers. I'll update it as I go through future games, but based on the games I've already played, these are the creatures that make me long for NetHack's Scroll of Genocide.1. Reapers (Ultima IV)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The reapers in Ultima IV have a spell that puts your entire party to sleep, and they use it over and over and over. \"But I have an (A)waken spell!\" you say. You fool. The spell only awakens one party member at a time, and by that time the reaper's put your entire party to sleep again.This would be forgivable, maybe, if reapers were otherwise challenging, but their regular attack is so pathetic that there would be no reason not to set up camp right next to a reaper. In fact, if you could capture one, they might come in handy. Take it out of its sack at night, let it put everyone to sleep, and enjoy it's occasional tickle as you dream. Mothers would say, \"Oh, honey, you can't sleep? Let me get the reaper out of the attic.\"Their only purpose is to slow you down; to make you take baby steps through the room before you can finally get in weapon range. The room above, which had nine reapers, took me 45 minutes. Jackasses.2. Sprites (Might & Magic I)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Sprites love to roam the corridors of Sorpigal, the starting city in Might & Magic, and if you encounter a pack of them before you hit Level 4, you might as well shut down the game and reload. Their special ability is a \"curse\" spell that lowers your chances of hitting them, and when they cast these spells en masse, you can't hit anything. Only when you get spells that affect entire groups of monsters do they stop being a threat. Centaurs are almost as bad, but by the time you start encountering them, you have better defenses.3. Gigglers (Dungeon Master)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Everything about these little thieving bastards is annoying, from the shuffle of their feet as they approach from behind to the annoying sound they make [MP3 link] as they steal your stuff and go scampering off into some dark corner. Eager not to lose your prized Sword of Whatever, you go charging after them, falling into traps, encountering foes you didn't expect, getting lost, only to finally run into them, have them steal something else, and go running off again. The only solution I found was to keep a couple of fireballs handy and loose them at the moment of their approach.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4. Flying Eyes (Might & Magic VI)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Technically, this is a class of creatures, including flying eyes, terrible eyes, and maddening eyes. The last name is best, though it would be better if they'd called them drive-you-insane-and-make-you-want-to-smash-your-computer eyes. How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways: you stay out of melee weapon range; you keep moving, so missile weapons and spells usually miss you; you have a spell that cancels every single one of my spells, and you don't even have to hit me with it; indeed, you can even cast said spell through walls, so that the merest hint of your presence on a level above or below me, or through a wall adjacent to me, will send me spinning into the dark with no protection. Your ranged attacks turn my characters insane. And there are about 600 of you in Castle Darkmoor; clearing the castle literally takes a day of game time.One of the greatest pleasures of Might & Magic VI is returning to Castle Darkmoor once it's respawned and you've achieved mastery of blaster rifles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5. Cliff Racers (Morrowind)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These relentless @#^*$s are near-legendary: The way they tail you from above and suddenly descend without warning; the way they pile up on top of each other so suddenly you're facing eight of them; their heart-stopping screech; and most of all, the way they chase you tirelessly across the entire island of Vvardenfell. They're everywhere. You literally cannot outrun them. (If you're very lucky, you might be able to trap one behind a fallen branch and make your getaway.) If you encounter one as a low-level character with waning health, you'd better hope you have a teleport scroll, or you might as well lie down. They'll even follow you into towns, mercilessly attacking guards and citizens, sometimes killing quest-dependent characters. Oh, and they have a reasonably good chance of giving you blight disease!Their only saving grace is their racer plumes, which you need for levitation potions.The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages notes that \"the development team has admitted the sheer amount of cliff racers in the game was a mistake.\" No kidding. In Oblivion, there's a reference to \"St. Jiub, who drove the cliff racers from Vvardenfell.\" Jiub is the Dunmer who you encounter in the ship at the very beginning of the game. I'd love to replay Morrowind as him rather than the Nerevarine.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6. Beholders (Baldur's Gate II)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Man, these guys are tough. You encounter them by the dozens during one of the quests, and they blast you with rapid-fire damage, petrification, and death spells. They also have an annoying habit of ignoring your summoned creatures. Your only defense is to seriously buff your lead character and send him gingerly forward while everyone else rains missile weapons at them.Late in the game,  you get a cloak of mirroring that turns their own spells back at them. The character wearing it can stroll through a beholder dungeon, letting all of them slay themselves, collecting all their experience, without having to lift a finger. They're either bloody impossible or no challenge at all. That's what we call \"bad balance.\"7. Barrow Wights* (Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter)\u00a0\u00a0 The opening sections of the Heart of Winter expansion to Icewind Dale have a host of creatures that are good candidates for this list, including wailing virgins (spirits who decimate you with magic while hovering just outside of attack range) and drowned dead (nearly impossible to damage). But barrow wights have to be the worst. When you first encounter, them, they are way overpowered. A single wight can tear apart your entire party if you encounter him unprepared, and they move at double-time, so you can't outrun them.Fighting them is like preparing for Waterloo. You buff the hell out of your characters.You set any traps you have. You summon as many creatures as the game will let you summon. You cast \"haste\" on your party. You slowly advance forward, keeping your summoned creatures ahead of you, until one sees you. If you're lucky, he charges your summoned creatures while you pummel him with arrows, spells, and magic items. In a few seconds, your summoned beasts have been turned to vapor. Hopefully, by the time he comes in melee range, he's either badly wounded or almost dead. He takes your lead character down to 1/4 hit points before you finally kill him. You stand over his corpse, arrows running low, spells spent, exhausted from the \"haste\" spell wearing off. Congratulations: you've killed one. There's like 25 more.(*The original posting had \"cold wight\" here, which is a separate creature in the game that I confused with barrow wights. Thanks to an anonymous commenter for pointing that out.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8. Wisps (Ultima V and Oblivion).\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Wisps are very different creatures in these two games, but they're infuriating in both of them. In Ultima V, they can possess your characters, which leaves you with no good options except to kill them. You can negate the possession with a \"negate magic\" spell, but the problem is that wisps hide out behind walls, and they need their magic abilities to teleport into range. Thus, if you have \"negate magic\" active, you can't fight them, and if you turn it off, you end up fighting your own characters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The only thing worse than wisps is wisps AND sharks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oblivion's wisps are some of the toughest bastards in the game. They take very little damage from non-magic weapons and they cast continuous \"drain health\" at you, which not only depletes your health but regenerates theirs. It's possible to beat at one with a sword, axe, or mace for an hour, constantly refreshing your health and stamina with potions, and still have them at full health. The only solution is to charge them quickly with a magic weapon--shock works best--and whale at them before they can get a good rhythm going with their damage health spells.The good news is they drop glow dust. I was always short on \"light\" potions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These two games, however different their original treatment of wisps, have something in common: they both completely retcon wisps in later installments. In Ultima VI, they become telepathic communicators to another dimension, and in Skyrim, they become dangerous-but-nowhere-nearly-as-annoying emanations from a \"wisp mother.\" More annoying enemies added to this list as they occur to me!"}, {"title": "Demon's Winter: A Slight Thaw", "date": "Monday, March 7, 2011", "text": "I don't like this guy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When we last left Demon's Winter, I had finished two dungeons and I was a little uncertain about the game. But I was also exhausted, having just finished an entire month on the road, and my perception was a little skewed. Since then, I have warmed to the game a bit.My next step was to travel to a dungeon called Qoorik on an island south of the mainland of Ymros. (I kept calling it Zoorik in the last posting; the odd game font is a bit confusing.) To get there, I needed to purchase a ship from one of the port cities. Once I had the ship, though, I was in no particular hurry to get to Qoorik, and I spent some time sailing around the game world and visiting various temples, and training guilds. There are a lot of temples in the game, which is odd given that they have such a limited purpose.The world of Demon's Winter, courtesy of Andrew Schultz, who I talked about in a posting last year. I'm not 100% sure that a game map came with the game, so I might be viewing massive spoilers here.There are a bunch of places to train, but with only a limited number of skills that each character can learn, I was a bit wary about spending any of my points. I had my paladin master fencing, I gave berserking to my barbarian, and my wizard mastered wind runes.Is it just me, or does this sound a bit lewd?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the sea, I was introduced to the joys of sea combat, which hasn't changed appreciably since Ultima II: I basically hit the (f)ire key and shoot at other ships and the occasional sea snake. These battles give an absurdly high amount of experience--at least 10 times the average land battle--but it comes a high cost. If the ship takes on too much damage, it sinks, so I have to repair it frequently, which costs a lot of gold.  Some of the battles inexplicably take place in areas surrounded by walls, and if I miss the enemies, my cannonballs ricochet off the walls and smash back into my own ship! I fought on the sea until I was out of gold and then headed for Qoorik.Bland but rewarding combat with pirate ships.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a couple of towns, I got interesting hints about the main quest. I had thought that the game didn't reference Shard of Spring, but I was wrong:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The next town served up a reference to the villain in this game:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 After reading both of these, I realized with a start that the main quest of Demon's Winter hasn't even begun! For all my characters know, they're just trying to figure out why the pack of goblins attacked Ildryn. In other words, the \"Demon's Winter\" of the title hasn't actually started. This comment by Giauz had gone over my head the first time I read it, but he's right. If SSI had made Baldur's Gate, they would have titled it Child of Bhaal.Qoorik turned out to be invisible, but I knew where to look and ended up stumbling into it. The experience I got from ship combats served me well, as the dungeon knocked up the level of monsters significantly, throwing demons and high-level spellcasters at me. My wizard become essentially a healer only: I needed his healing spells too much to waste spell points on offensive spells. I had to resurrect characters a couple of times.This troll turned out to be a lying bastard.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The dungeon was huge and multi-leveled, and I don't know if I explored all of it (I find it too hard and unrewarding to make maps for isometric games). Amidst a number of fixed encounters with Xeres's minions, I solved several inventory puzzles. A troll blacksmith game me a broad sword that he said was designed to kill Xeres, but when I had it identified in town, it turned out to be cursed. I found a black wand that I had to use on an archway to teleport between levels. A skeleton key opened a door in a crypt and took me to a shifting maze of tombstones that I had to navigate.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 An old bookcase concealed a secret door that led to a skeleton holding a   piece of paper that said \"Ymros is Mine!\" There were runes painted on   the wall, that have the same number of characters: perhaps this is a code key for a later puzzle?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In another room, I found a bag, used it to scoop up some red dust that I then burned in a censer, and I got an image of a demon who said: \"The father of demons sees all. Only  those who possess the demon crystal can escape his sight.\" Other items I haven't figured out the use for, including a piece of papyrus, an ancient tome, vials of goblin's and unicorn's blood, and a microscope (it doesn't seem to do anything with the blood).A Ouija board in a \"gypsy room\" told me to \"walk along river Styx until you find the ferryman.\" I did that, and gave him some black coins I'd found to take me across a river. There, I encountered a tough battle with a \"gravekeeper\":\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When I finally killed the gravekeeper and his minions, my characters were nearly dead and my spellcaster was out of spell points. I limped my way through a fire-shrouded maze and, at last, encountered Xeres, whose screen shot leads this posting. He slew me without much trouble--several times.One thing hasn't changed from Shard of Spring,  although in the first posting I thought it had: the game throws a  \"random\" encounter at you every 43 movements, no exceptions. This makes  it particularly hard if you're stuck deep in a dungeon with low hit  points and spell points; you can't trust luck to carry you back to the  exit. This is where I stand now: stuck between Xeres, who I can't defeat, and the long return to the entrance, which I can't make. I'm also almost out of food, so walking around and repeatedly resting isn't an option.Though I'm not looking forward to starting over again, there are several things I've come to like about the game. The inventory puzzles have been intriguing and the encounters more memorable than in Shard of Spring. The dungeon was a fun challenge to navigate (though I wish I hadn't gotten myself stuck).I'll keep throwing myself at Xeres and let you know what happens. I may have to start over. In the meantime, here's a video of my most successful battle against Xeres. You can see how combat works. The monsters move around the screen in odd patterns, making it tough to gang up and kill them one-by-one.I actually managed to kill the demon himself, but his minions finished off my characters. I never got this close again in six or seven other combats. I suspect I erred in assuming that the cursed sword was a fake and tossing it; maybe it really was intended to kill Xeres.Keep in mind, this is still the beginning of the game! I can't imagine it gets easier."}, {"title": "Game 1257: The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion", "date": "Sunday, March 6, 2011", "text": "The answer to the question \"Where the hell have you been for the last week?\" is a funny one. (Unless you've been eagerly awaiting my next Demon's Winter posting, or my next Bard's Tale III posting, or my next any posting that re-establishes some kind of regularity and order to my blog.) Here it is: my CRPG addiction has been threatened...by my CRPG addiction.Here's how it started. Five or six weeks ago, Irene (my wife) and I were looking for something to do on a Wednesday night, and she suggested that we go buy an X-box 360, having never upgraded our original X-box. She had read that you can get Netflix Instant Play on it, as well as stuff from Zune*, and anyway she likes games. Actually, to clarify: she likes watching me play games while she shouts helpful suggestions and looks up hints online.Now, you hardcore gamers are thinking that I have the perfect wife, and I admit she can be pretty cool. But she only likes a small subset of games: cinematic, fairly linear, plot-heavy CRPGs with lots of dialog options, like Knights of the Old Republic and Jade Empire. This is great, because I like these games too, but frankly once you get past them there aren't many like them. I tried to show her Morrowind on the old X-box, but she was bored to tears with it.So. We pop over to Gamestop (yes, I'm that square) and pick up the console and two games she likes the look of: Star Wars: The Force Unleashed and Lost Odyssey. I try to tell her that the Star Wars game isn't going to be like KOTOR, but she doesn't listen. We get back, and sure enough she soon gets tired of it when she realizes there are no dialog options. She likes Lost Odyssey a little better, but I don't. So we stop playing games for a few days and watch all the seasons of The Guild (great show; I should do a special topics posting on it later). Then, a few days later, she's reading X-box 360 game reviews online and says, \"Have you ever heard of this Oblivion game?\"\"I think I played it once a few years ago,\" I say, teetering on the verge of an outright lie and then finally going over the edge. \"I didn't get very far.\" (She won't want to buy it if she knows I've won it three or four times.)\"It's supposed to be really good,\" she says. \"But I guess it's a sequel, so maybe we should play the others first.\"\"The first two aren't available on the X-box and you wouldn't like them anyway,\" I say quickly. \"And you don't need to play the first games to understand the fourth. It takes place in an entirely new part of Tamriel and your character is unconnected with the past plots.\"\"Apparently,\" I add, as she looks at me suspiciously.So we go buy it. All the time, a warning is ringing through my ears that she won't like it, but I don't listen to it. If I can get her to enjoy Oblivion, it's like synergy. I can spend quality time with her and play games. Thoughts of what will happen to this blog are there, but not in the forefront.She's enchanted at first. We spend what seems like forever making the character. A cat lover, she immediately wants to play a Khajit.\"You can't play a Khajit your first time 'round,\" I explain. \"You have to unlock some achievements first.\"We finally settle on a Dunmer (female of course) and get started. The game immediately fools her (like it fooled all of us) by pretending like it has dialog options when you first speak to the emperor.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of about five dialog options in the entire game (and no, choosing what topic to ask about is not a \"dialog option\").\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She spends an eternity deciding on a class, carefully reading the game manual to me while I tell myself, \"You can't tell her you already know all this. You can't tell her about custom classes. You can't tell her about the leveling problem. Just go with it.\" We make the character an agent.Within a couple of hours, she's seen past the game's facade and has realized that she doesn't like it, especially when I insist on doing side quests (she wants to just follow the main quest). So she's done with it.But of course I'm not. I'm hooked again. And for the past week, all of my normal CRPG time has gone into Oblivion. When she abandoned me, I created a new character and laughed maniacally as I decided this would be a complete game: all quests solved, all Oblivion gates closed, all skills to 100, all places found! As she headed off to work every morning, I made a show of firing up my laptop and recounting all of the things I had to get done today. Then, the moment her car left the driveway, I kicked on the console and sat on the couch for 8.5 hours. The moment I heard tires crushing ice, I saved, turned off the console, and leaped back to my computer.\"Did you get a lot of work done?\" She'd say, as she took off her coat.\"A little,\" I'd reply. \"These clients are killing me, though. I spent most of the day just cleaning data.\" Yes, I'm a horrible, horrible man.A week later, I'm a bit Oblivioned-out. I certainly haven't finished. And this isn't my official posting on the game, of course, which will come for real some time in 2023, probably. But here are some notes from my fifth or sixth playthrough:I decided to do something fun this time. First, I picked up Martin immediately on arrival in Kvatch, and I took him on my quest through the city to kill all the Daedra. I decided we were fire-forged friends at that point, and rather than return him immediately to Weynon Priory, I enlisted him to follow me all over the province, exploring dungeons and solving quests. He fights well and can't die. Sometimes I lose him in a dungeon, but he always shows up at the exit when I leave.The game is most fun, in my opinion, between Levels 2 and 10. After that, it gets a little ridiculous, with every roadside bandit sporting Elven or ebony armor. Fortunately, if you play it right you can decide when you level up. I wait until I have at least 50 skill level advances since the last level.The disadvantage to playing on the X-box is that you can't install any mods, some of which I found delightful, correcting the very problem mentioned above and making the game both harder and better-balanced.The NPCs are, in my opinion, the weakest part of the game. Unlike some reviewers, I'm not enthralled by the fact that all of the dialog is spoken. I'd rather they'd spent their time offering actual dialog choices to the PC. The voice acting isn't even all that good. It seems like the same five voice actors did all the voices except the Emperor and Martin, and sometimes an NPC (often a beggar) changes voices in the middle of a chat.Related to this, there's essentially only one way to solve any quest you get in the game. And the game gives you quests without so much as a by-your-leave. Yes, you could ignore them in the quest list, unless you have CRPG OCD like me.I don't see how you play this game \"evil.\" It's hard to reconcile becoming a member of the Dark Brotherhood with caring about the main quest line and serving the Blades. If you play \"good,\" it's hard to reconcile doing anything but the main quest line. With Oblivion gates popping up all over Cyrodil, what possible justification do I have finding Ayleid artifacts for some rich dude, or bottles of wine for a publican? And the simultaneous existence of the main quest, the Shivering Isles quest, and the Knights of the Nine quest makes little sense. The only logical way to play the game is to solve the main quest as soon as possible, and then do everything else, unless you do what I do and come up with some kind of external role-playing reason to take a long break in between stages of the main quest.Thus, it isn't the plot that I like but the game play itself. Things that I find absurdly enjoyable: lighting up a torch for the first time as I enter an unexplored ruin; using a Nighteye potion to spot enemies at long range, then sniping him with an arrow soaked in a Damage Health poison from a hidden alcove; loading up on everything I find when I first enter a dungeon and then slowly discarding things that aren't worth their weight in gold, then aren't worth twice their weight in gold, then three times, and so on, as I get more overburdened; saving up incredible loads of reagents and then mixing up a huge batch of potions all at once; luring enemies into booby traps; throwing the bodies of each slain enemy all the way down the Oblivion fortress spire; saving up low-level damage scrolls that I find and then using them all at once against a single enemy; whacking a bandit with a dagger poisoned repeatedly with Damage Fatigue, waiting until he collapses in exhaustion, then beating him to death with my fists; pickpocketing enemies before I backstab them.I can't show images of any of this, of course, since it's on my TV. (Cue six people telling me how I could, in fact, show images.) But it doesn't matter, because I'm done with Oblivion for now. It's taking too much of my time, and I don't just mean CRPG time. The benefit of playing CRPGs on my computer is that I'm at my computer and thus not liable to forget my \"to do\" list.Although I still prefer a PC to a console, there is something enjoyably lazy about playing CRPGs from the couch on a big screen. I keep meaning to look up how to connect my computer to the television, but I don't suppose it makes much sense until I get out of the era in which I still need DOSBox.For the next two weeks, I'm back on track and will have a posting at least every other day. I promise.*Addendum: trying to purchase Microsoft Points through X-box Live failed with every one of four credit cards I tried, and it also led to every one of those credit cards being frozen for potential fraud. I had to call them all and explain the purchase attempts were legitimate, but even after doing so, the charges still wouldn't go through. I had to buy the points through Amazon via gift card and then \"redeem\" them. Message boards were full of people with similar stories. I'm mystified."}, {"title": "Demon's Winter: Miscellaneous Stuff in Bulleted Form", "date": "Sunday, February 27, 2011", "text": "A puppet? That doesn't sound too hard.Bulleted lists of \"things I've discovered\" always seem like a hackneyed way to convey information, but they do have the advantage of being somewhat simple to write and, I hope, read:The game couldn't possibly be more unhelpful in its initial distribution of characters during combat. Almost always, my characters are facing away from the enemy, and my spellcaster in the last rank is almost always closest to them. This may seem like a nitpicking complaint, but since even turning costs moves in this game, I'd rather they started facing towards the enemy. Not being able to attack or move on the diagonal is also a bit annoying.The characters bravely prepare to attack to the northwest. Too bad the enemy is to the southeast.The game suddenly makes you camp every time it decides your characters are \"sleepy.\" If you don't have a unit of food for everybody when you camp, you lose hit points. The need for food is slightly annoying. I ran out in a dungeon and had to take a break to go outside and hunt.Leveling up turned out to be matter of finding a town with a \"guild,\" where they either train you or tell you how many experience points you have left to earn.Priestly types can \"convert\" to another deity. I haven't tried it yet.Like Ultima IV, the game has a day/night cycle. To mimic night, the peripheral areas of the screen go black until you can only see for a limited box around you. I guess this is where that \"visionary\" class would come in handy.Developers: this adds nothing to the game.The game is fond of random encounters. They're not regular as in Shard of Spring (where they came every 33 moves), but they are frequent.A clue that RJ left me in my last posting informed me about a baffling  interface design: shops show you only one item at a time, and you have  to keep hitting (c)ontinue to see the others. Nothing on the screen  informs you of this. The cool thing is that there's some expensive  equipment that I'll have to have much, much more gold to afford. I like  having economic goals.This item is pretty far in my future.As you explore dungeons, you must periodically hit the (i)nspect command; otherwise, you miss treasure and special encounters. This took me a while to figure out, and then I had to retrace my steps through the Temple of Gamur.A dungeon room with the \"inspect\" activated.Moving, examining, taking objects, and moving objects seem to be the  four ways that the characters interact with the environment and solve  puzzles. The Temple of Gamur took me a long time because I was trying to figure out the interface.The clue to the next dungeon, I guess.The entrance area gave way to a long secret passage in which I really couldn't see where I was going, and it took a while to map. There were a couple of inventory puzzles: I had to find a mallet to smash a glass case holding a prisoner, then heal him with a blue potion in order to get a clue about the entrance to a place called Zoorik, a mythical city beneath the earth whose existence I'd learned from a scroll. There was some good equipment in one wing of the temple, but in obtaining it, my wizard was killed by a column of fire from a will-o-wisp. There was another tough battle with a pair of skeleton mages.Boss lady.A secret door revealed itself when I moved a wooden altar, beyond which was a room in which my party kept getting crushed (and killed) by walls before I realized that the safe path through the room had been given to me in an inscription in another room. The boss of the dungeon was a woman named Remondadin, who fell fairly quickly to my blades. Afterward, a message informed me that the dungeon was \"only part of a small cult that worships Xeres--the demon who destroyed Ildryn.\" The game gave me the next quest of finding Xeres himself. But since he's named Xeres, not Malifon, I suspect he's the \"puppet\" mentioned in the opening screenshot.Consulting the game map, I see that Idlewood, southeast of the dungeon of Zoorik, is on another island. I'm not sure how I get there yet, but I'm sure I'll figure it out.Fighting skeletons.Combat ought to be tactical, but it's already striking me as somewhat boring and repetitive, just like it did in Shard of Spring. I can't quite put my finger on what makes this combat fundamentally different from the similar combat in the Gold Box games, and I have to leave myself open to the possibility that it isn't different--that the exciting tactical combat I remember from Pool of Radiance is pretty much identical to this, and I'll be just as bored when I get to it. I hope not.I'm having a weird feeling about the entire game. This feeling has hit me before with other games: even though I understand it, and there's nothing I'm really confused about, it seems oddly inaccessible, like there's something I'm not quite \"getting\" about it, like it somehow wasn't written for me. I know that doesn't make any sense, and it's possible I'm just in a weird mood--this was my last week of classes, and I haven't been getting much sleep. I'll see how I feel after a solid 14 hours tonight. I should be back on a regular posting schedule after that."}, {"title": "Game 48: Demon's Winter (1988)", "date": "Wednesday, February 23, 2011", "text": "Made glorious summer by this son of York.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Demon's WinterUnited StatesStrategic Simulations, Inc. (developer and publisher)Released\u00a01988 for Apple II; 1989 for Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST, and DOS.Date Started: 23 February 2011\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I tell you, I haven't been keeping up well on my \"upcoming games\" list. Until I read an e-mail from reader RJ yesterday, I didn't realize that Demon's Winter was a sequel to Shard of Spring. You may recall that I didn't really like Shard of Spring. I could see it as part of the evolution between Wizard's Crown and the Gold Box games, but I found it trite and boring, albeit with a reasonably good combat system.Shard of Spring had a group of adventurers recovering the title artifact from the evil sorceress (or troll, or dragon--there was some confusion at the end) Siriadne, whose theft had created an icy wasteland out of the island nation of Ymros. Demon's Winter is set 5,000 years later, and one hopes the island learned from its previous attempt at environmental tampering, as there is no mention of the fabled Shard. Instead, some demon named Malifon has shown up and unleashed armies of goblins and kobolds and whatnot on the peaceful towns of Ymros, and in some vague way that I haven't encountered yet, he's threatening to plunge the land into eternal winter. Honestly, what do these SSI people have against winter? I think it's kind of pretty, and you have lots of excuses for staying indoors and playing CRPGs.Selecting skills and a \"diety\" [sic] during character creation.Demon's Winter does have some innovations over Shard of Spring. First, the list of character classes is quite expanded. In the first game, you could just be a warrior or wizard. In this game, you have a choice of 10 classes: ranger, barbarian, paladin, monk, cleric, thief, wizard, sorcerer, visionary, and scholar. Your choice of class essentially determines how easy or hard it is to learn certain skills (and which skills are available initially). Shard had a skills-based system, too, but the selection of skills was so limited that by the end of the game, every character had pretty much every skill. This game is a bit more balanced. Fighter classes learn combat skills (sword, axe, karate, fencing, etc.) quite easily but spellcasters have to spend a lot of points. The schools of magic (fire, metal, wind, ice, and spirit) are unchanged from Shard but there are some new magic skills--illusion, summon, and possession--in which sorcerers excel. You get to select two skills upon character creation and you can buy more at \"colleges\" scattered throughout the land.Some of the classes are intriguing. The \"visionary\" has special skills that let him see the surrounding area, and the \"scholar\" can identify weapons, armor, and potions. I experimented with both but ultimately found them too useless in regular battle, and their skills don't help that much anyway. RJ, who has a lot of enthusiasm for the game, sent me some hints (bordering on spoilers but not quite) which explained why thieves and sorcerers are a bit worthless. He recommended two paladins, a ranger, a barbarian, and a wizard. I went mostly with his recommendations but chose a paladin and a monk instead of two paladins.Like Shard, there are five races: humans, dwarves, elves, dark elves, and trolls (dark elves replaces gnomes from Shard). My current party consists of:Mathamas, a human paladinGrendel, a troll barbarianConstans, a dwarf monkTriamour, a elf rangerClinscho, a dark elf wizardThere's also a religious system in the game that's new. Characters who choose \"priesthood\" as a skill gain access to one of five priestly or shaman deities, each of whom does something different when you pray to him or her and he or she isn't feeling out of sorts. For my monk, I chose the god Illo, who offers a chance at resurrection--something that a no-reloading player often needs.That's a robust marketplace there. It sells exactly one dagger.The game starts you with no equipment in what seems to be a random place. The first time I started, I was in a dungeon, and the second two times, I was in some part of the wilderness. In no case does the game give you much of a clue about where to go first or what to do, so I just started messing around. The first thing I tested was whether encounters spring up every 33 moves the way they did in Shard. I am happy to say they do not.Outdoors in Ymros, which seems suspiciously un-wintery.The basic gameplay has changed little in the two years. You move overland as a single icon, encounter various towns, dungeons, and colleges. Right away, the game world seems larger than Shard, and in much better detail (compare the above to this). In combat, which pops up randomly and at certain fixed positions, you switch to a tactical map in which each character has his or her own icon.Yes, that would be a rat I'm fighting.In combat, each character has a certain number of moves based on speed, which you can spend attacking, maneuvering into position, casting spells, turning undead, praying to your deity, healing other party members, using items, or just defending yourself. There are tactics associated with how you position your party members and whether you let them come to you or go charging at them.This is a bad battle formation.I outfitted my party with daggers and wandered around until I found the College of Hunting, where I trained my ranger in that skill so food would be easier to come by.A quest-ish tavern tale.In a town, I heard a tavern rumor that there was a band of marauding kobolds in a camp to the south, led by someone named Uffspgot or Uffuspgot (consistency in spelling is not one of the game's strong points). I found their camp easy enough and within four or five steps, I was face-to-face with the kobold leader, who in an overheard conversation identified his master as someone named Xeres.So you don't spend the rest of the day wondering, they were snarling at me.Uff(u)spgot turned out to be a bit of a pushover. I made quick work of him and several of his minions in tents surrounding his. In one, I found a woman being taunted by some kobolds and freed her. In another, I found a note that said a cult worshipping Xeres could be found in the catacombs under the Temple of Gamur and the codeword needed to enter is -X-.So far, I'm not regretting taking the karate-skilled monk. He seems to  be the only one who does a consistently high amount of damage, but of  course most of my characters are fighting with daggers.At last, I found a note that told me what the manual didn't make explicit: my group of adventurers is simply questing to find out what happened to the village of Ildryn, whose destruction is chronicled in a brief story at the beginning of the manual. They know nothing about Malifon and winter at this point. Now it makes more sense.Not sure where to find the Temple, I decided to try to circle the perimeter of the map. Heading east to find water, I ran into a group of Level 4 mages and was almost instantly slaughtered by fireball spells. Much like its predecessor, the game does not reward off-the-beaten-path exploration.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 That's good enough for a start. I remain a little uncertain how best to allocate my limited skill points, and I'm not sure how my characters level up, but I'm sure I'll figure it out tomorrow."}, {"title": "An Update", "date": "Tuesday, February 22, 2011", "text": "I've spent the last three weeks on the road, and every night I swore I was going to play and post something, and every night I found an excuse not to do it.

Frankly, I forgot what I was even doing in The Bard's Tale III and probably because of that couldn't make much headway in the next quest. BattleTech didn't excite me at the outset, although I still want to write about it.To get me back in the game, I need a bit of a palate-cleanser, so I'm going to try this Demon's Winter for a little bit and, once I'm back on the wave, probably alternate between it and The Bard's Tale III.

But perhaps nothing else better exemplifies the feast-or-famine nature of my blog. As hiatuses go, this last 10 days has been one of my shorter ones--I had breaks in May and August last year that I wasn't sure I'd recover from.My winning Rogue screenshot.This blog began at the encouragement of a Reddit user named RedDyeNumber4, after I won Rogue and posted a screen shot to /r/games. I had just spent four months trying to beat the game, and I wanted to share the triumph with someone. I don't know why the idea of a blog hadn't occurred to me before. I had long been drafting thoughts on CRPGs--some of which have appeared among my \"special topics\" postings--but if I thought about publishing them at all, I guess I thought I might interest a site like Gamespot or something. Once I had the suggestion, though, I was very excited about it.I know various aspects of my plan--DOS only, chronological order, six hours no matter how forgettable the game--have struck some readers as silly, and many of you have suggested changes or exceptions. But making a specific plan and sticking with it is very much within my personality. If I had to do it again, I probably would have set a rule about playing the games on their best platforms, but I definitely wouldn't jettison the six-hour rule, which has prevented me from writing trite, cursory postings on some games while rushing to the ones I most anticipate. Even with the rule, I've given a raw deal to certain titles. I could have tried a bit harder on Wizardry II, III, and IV, for instance, and I should have spent more time on Swords of Glass, which seems now like an authentically good-but-overlooked title--the very thing I started this blog to find.On the whole, though, I'm satisified that the blog has met its purpose. I am a guilty hobbiest, and I can assuage that guilt by having a goal to my hobbies. I used to feel slightly ashamed at all the time I spent on crossword puzzles, but now that I attend the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament every year, my crossword time becomes \"training.\" I used to hate myself for all the CRPG hours--going so far as throwing away games in disgust after winning them--but now I have this project, and goals for it, and readers who seem to like my postings. This makes me feel better about playing games. In fact, it makes me feel bad if I don't play games for a long stretch of time, as in the past 10 days.The CRPG addict's weekly visits, courteey of Google Analytics.At the outset, I didn't think I'd care whether I had many readers or not. I considered the blog primarily a self-expression project. But I've been surprised at how much I've come to value comments and dialog. I know nothing about most of you, but I've learned to recognize and appreciate your unique voices. Some of you offer me good supplemental information about the games, some of you have great senses of humor. I can always count on one or two of you for hints. You've helped me with research, files, and translations--sometimes removing a convenient excuse to just move on from a game! When you've disappeared...well, I haven't cried myself to sleep, but it's been a little disappointing. Two longtime, quality commenters stalked off permanently when I bailed on Faery Tale Adventure. It's made me more conscious of the consequences of giving up on games that are someone's favorites.Here's something I didn't mention on my blog when it happened: a few months ago, I quit my job so that I could do training, teaching, and contract work full-time. I haven't revealed  my profession on this blog, not because I care if you know, but because I don't want people from my profession finding the blog. It would cause a lot of issues. But imagine I was something like a state economic planner, and then I started teaching and consulting on economic planning, and now I do that teaching and consulting full-time. That'll give you the right idea. The reality of my new life is that I'm on the road at least half the time, but when I'm not, I'm at home all day, and the temptation to play games instead of working is all too real. I was home for most of the month of January, which explains my prodigious output, and I'm traveling most of the month of February, which I hope excuses my recent drop-off.I can never correctly anticipate how much time I'll have. Sometimes I'll be going to a conference with plenty of friends and colleagues, and yet I find I have a lot of time to play--almost all of Dungeon Master was written from hotel rooms in Dallas and Seattle. Other times, I'll be headed to a boring place I don't like, like Kansas City last week or Phoenix a few months ago, assuming that I'll be playing and blogging at night, and I end up absurdly busy all week. I've experimented with writing postings in advance, and sometimes it works. You didn't notice when I was gone for a week in January because I had already won Ys before my first posting on Sorcerian was even published.Over the last few months, I've started to receive a lot more direct e-mails from readers or other people asking about my blog. Sometimes, I don't really know what they want. Other times, I'm delighted, as when a reader recently gave me the opportunity to comment on a CRPG under development. Between the blog comments and e-mail, I get a lot of the same questions over and over, so here are the answers to a few:Time: I have time to play so many games by staying up late at night. I do much of my playing in the four hours after my wife goes to bed and before I get tired. I don't have many other hobbies, I don't follow sports, and I don't watch TV except what I get on Netflix Instant Play during a particularly boring game, so I have extra time that most people don't.Comments: I get an e-mail alert for every comment someone leaves, and I read every comment no matter how old the original posting. I respond to about 50% of them based on my overall reaction. I think I've responded to almost all questions.Maps: I make them in Excel by using the \"draw borders\" tool. Nothing fancy.Money: I don't put ads on my site because I can't imagine the amount of revenue would make it worth while. I don't want to make this blog about money. If regular readers feel compelled to pay me back, I wish they'd just offer to buy me a drink when I'm in their towns.Wife: I have one. Her name is Irene. She doesn't know about the blog, and I think it would be kind of difficult to tell her after doing this for a year. She does occasionally like to play console games with me, and a few weeks ago we went out and bought an X-box 360 and a few games she liked the look of, one of which was Oblivion. The irony stings.The ultimate message that I want to convey here is that I'm grateful to all of you who read the blog. You've helped turn something that I used to do solo--and feel embarrassed about--into a kind-of community where you can share my joy of good games, my disgust and amusement at bad games, and make unique discoveries as we tour the history of CRPGs. I apologize for my hot-and-cold publication schedule, but I'll try to do better in Year 2. Stick with me, and we'll have a lot of fun together."}, {"title": "Bard's Tale III: Brief Break", "date": "Sunday, February 6, 2011", "text": "Switching to the chronomancer class.Yikes! I take two days off and I have something like 50 postings to reply to. I'll work on that a bit this afternoon.I am going to keep going with The Bard's Tale III, based partly on your comments that it improves, and partly because my win/give-up ratio hasn't been looking so good lately. But unfortunately, I'm spending the week in Kansas City and I forgot to copy the save game from my old laptop to my new one (which I have with me) before I left. So to the extent that I get any playing time this week, my next post will be on BattleTech. I'll resume with BT3 next weekend.In the meantime, anyone know who this guy is? Was he in The Bard's Tale II? I encountered him when I stepped into Arboria, the first alternate dimension.\u00a0 Later edit: The \"brief break\" ultimately stretched on so long that I forgot what I was even doing in the game. I've kicked Bard's Tale III lower on the 1988 list and I'll basically start over with it after I get through 8 or 10 other games.Much later edit: It was over a year before I got back to it. Here is the next posting."}, {"title": "Bard's Tale III: More Complaints, Mostly", "date": "Friday, February 4, 2011", "text": "A harmonic gem at last!The last two days have been full of complete bull$%&*.Yesterday I timed it. With the bard song \"The Rhyme of Duotime\" playing, spell points regenerate at a rate of two every 30 seconds. My characters had around 160 spell points then, so if they came out of a dungeon needing to regenerate 140 of them, that took 35 minutes. But there are other complications because \"The Rhyme of Duotime\" only lasts about three minutes, meaning I'd have to keep resetting it, which defeats the purpose of doing other things while I wait. That means that a real regeneration took closer to 55 minutes providing I remembered to reset the song once. However, this also doesn't take into account that spell points only regenerate during the daylight, and day and night both last about 10 minutes. This effectively doubles the amount of time it takes to recharge spells unless I stand outside the refugee camp and remember to enter and exit every once in a while (you always return to morning when you leave the camp).The upside is that I had to wait at least 35 minutes, but practically more like 70 minutes, in between trips to the dungeon. It's hard to believe I'm not missing something, but I don't think I am. I've only found one \"harmonic gem,\" which does indeed regenerate all spell points for a single character, but I kind of feel like I need to save that for emergencies.I'm just putting this here because I thought this guy looked weird.What makes this particularly unforgivable is the multiple dungeon squares that sap your magic points. There's nothing like waiting an hour to recharge your spell points only to head into the dungeon and watch half of them drain away.While I'm complaining, here's a few other things:Spellcaster leveling makes no sense. Once you've achieved the seventh spell rank (character Level 13) in your first class, there's no reason not to switch to the next class. Switching starts you back at 0 experience points, but with no detriment to your health or spell points. Leveling comes extraordinarily quickly at this point. It took my characters about 3 hours of playing to get to Level 13 in their first spell classes, then only about an hour to get to Level 13 in their second classes and less than that to get to Level 13 in their third. During the time that the two spellcasters went through 13 levels the third time around, all my other characters rose maybe 1.I don't like the way the characters find items at the end of combat. The game forces you to take whatever you find, but with no way to sell the items, 90% of the time, you immediately go into the character's inventory and discard it. A better game would ask what items you wanted to keep.The only way to tell if a bard song is still playing is to have the volume on, but the bard songs--the only sound the game, as far as I can tell--just loop over and over and over again every 10 seconds or so. While the sound quality isn't bad, you can't listen to it for long.I don't mind random encounters in dungeons, but what annoys me is that enemies can attack when your only move is to turn. This makes mapping very frustrating. There are certain squares where it seems like every move produces an encounter. You finish fighting and then take a couple of turns to remind you where you are, and suddenly you're in battle again.The game doesn't seem to register a lot of my key-presses. I'll hit \"8\" twice to go north and map the walls assuming I've gone north twice. Then I find out it only registered one of them.In between times in which I was standing around waiting for spell points to recharge, I finished exploring the dungeon and ultimately killed Brilhasti, the Mad God's servant. To do this, I had to first solve two more riddles on Levels 4 and 5.  Both stumped me for a few minutes, although there were other clues on the levels as to the answers  (select the text to see the answers):\"I am nothing, I make nothing, but my opposite creates me even as it destroys me\" (SHADOW).\"I have no lips, yet my kiss is deadly. I am  not a razor, but those I caress need never shave again. Your best friend, I will kill you\" (SWORD).Answering them got me a message to the effect that maybe I am strong enough to defeat Brilhasti and a clear path to the stairs. Reader Eric nailed it:  it's more fun if you imagine these messages were scrawled in blood by a  spy as he tried to escape. That leaves the question of why he magicked  up a mouth with a riddle, though.Both levels featured plenty of spinners, anti-magic zones, silent zones, spell-point-draining squares, and invisible walls--things that seemed like novelties in the first Bard's Tale but are just tiresome now.Level 5 was also full of clues as to \"three wards\" that would \"try my soul\" on Level 6. Well, I don't know what they were talking about. Level 6 had spinners and dark zones and such, but it was easy enough just to plow through it and make my way to Brilhasti's lair...My most successful run at Brilhasti out of about 30. He soon killed me....where I promptly had my ass handed to me. Bad.  I didn't even come close. He was surrounded by four \"dark guards\" who cast pillars of fire at me, did 80-100 points of damage in melee attacks, and basically just slaughtered me even when my spellcasters were casting REST (full party health restore) every round. I reloaded about 30 times before I finally was able to kill the dark guards through DEST (destruction) spells. But then I had to \"advance\" across 60 feet to Brilhasti, and he wasted me with RIME (serious frost damage) spells along the way. When I finally reached him, two of my characters were dead, and then he started summoning greater demons. I didn't stand a chance.Discouraged, I returned to the surface--which was no picnic, by the way, walking back up four levels (the APAR teleport spell failed)--healed, and started to level grind. For an entire day, I killed easy, medium, and hard monsters throughout the Mad God's dungeon. My spellcasters finished mastering conjurer, magician, and sorcerer spells. But my regular characters only advanced a couple of levels throughout the entire day. Still, with my new spells and strength, I returned to Brilhasti's lair a second time.It ended mostly well.This time, I only had to reload about 15 times before I finally defeated Brilhasti and his guards, although I lost two characters in the combat. Yay! And my victory was accompanied by an automatic teleport out of the dungeon. Thank you! But this is where the final BS appeared.Returning to the review board, I found that killing Brilhasti gave me enough experience points to advance from Level 16 to LEVEL 36! Moreover, my two spellcasters, who I hadn't even changed to wizard, let alone archmage, suddenly had all the conjurer, magician, sorcerer, wizard, and archmage spells. What the hell?! I spend an entire day level grinding only to have the game hand me 20 levels and two full classes' worth of spells for a single combat? Could it maybe have balanced that a little better? Was the entire purpose of the first dungeon to get my characters to the level they would have been if they had finished The Bard's Tale II? This is bad, bad, bad game design. Aside from the new chronomancer class, my spellcasters have nowhere to go. My thief has 99 in all the thief abilities. Playing with way overpowered characters is no fun even if the monsters are hard; there's nowhere for my characters to develop.The next quest.So the \"last of the guild elders\"--the guy in the review board--wants me to go to some realm accessible through some trees and to bring back a bow and arrows from another adventurer named Valarian. To do this, I have to take one of my archmages and make him or her a chronomancer, leaving me with only one archmage unless I take the time to develop another. I'm going to bed now to sleep on whether I want to even keep playing this dumb game. I'll leave it running overnight, though, so maybe my 350 spell points will be recharged by the time I wake up in the morning.Sorry to sound so negative, but at least I know one thing now: my reviews of The Bard's Tale II  were not simply because I was in a \"bad mood.\" I was in quite a good mood two days ago, and I was eagerly anticipating this game. It's the game, not  me. This series sucks. Why is it considered a classic?"}, {"title": "Bard's Tale III: Just What I Needed", "date": "Wednesday, February 2, 2011", "text": "Enjoying the sunshine between battles.Some of you may have noticed that I've been a bit manic lately. In January, I had 29 postings--a monthly record for me--and I covered 11 games. Truth be told, I've probably been devoting too much time to playing CRPGs this month--to the detriment of my real work. Thus, The Bard's Tale III came along just in time.Let me explain. Spell points are vital to the survival of your characters. In fact, if the rest of the dungeons go like the first one did, I'm going to regret not just creating an all-spellcaster party. You need them for healing, buffing spells, exploration spells, and defensive spells, and all of the necessary exploration spells (magic compass, greater revelation, levitation, mystic shield) take up about 1/3 of your spell points right there. So when you go exploring and you start to run out of magic, it's time to get out of Dodge.The first two games had a shop called Roscoe's Energy Emporium where you could pay to get your spell points recharged. But in III, Roscoe's was destroyed by the Mad God. Thus, the only way to recharge your mana (that I can tell) is to hang around outside. This only works in the daytime, too, so if it happens to be night when you emerge from the dungeon, you have to wait.A full recharge takes about 20-30 minutes in real time, even with the bard song called \"The Rhyme of Duotime\" playing in the background. This time only gets longer as my levels (and, thus, max spell points) increase. Consequently, I'm getting a lot of work done on my \"to do\" list when I'm supposed to be playing the game. Explore the dungeon. Write a few pages for a report. Finish mapping Level 1. Check in on my online classes. Map half of Level 2. Design a database form. This really is just the kind of game I need. In fact, it gives me an idea: all computer games ought to come with built-in timers. When you create your character, you tell the game how long it should allow you to play and how long a break you should take in between playing sessions. Want to override those settings? Fine, but you'll have to restart from the beginning.Based on comments I got from yesterday's posting, there are things  called \"harmonic gems\" that recharge your spell points, but I haven't  found them yet.Tarjan's dungeon, Level 3I managed to map four levels of Tarjan's dungeon since my last posting It's  slow-going. The game throws encounters at you on every other square, it  seems, and you never \"clear\" a level, so it's relentless. With \"Sir  Robin's Tune\" playing, I can avoid most of the fights if I want to, but  obviously the point of the dungeon is to increase my experience. My  characters are Level 13/14 and my spellcasters have rolled over into  their second classes. I had to find a word on Level 2 (\"CHAOS\") to allow access to Level 3, and on Level 3 there was a riddle (\"The tint of melancholy paves the way\" and \"A splash of noble's blood colors the exit\"; answer: BLUE) to pass to Level 4.Here are my notes from the last day's sessions:In a departure from the first two games, monsters do not attack while you wait, only when you actually turn or move. This makes my strategy above possible.The game has introduced a new way to cast spells,  and it's so annoying that I don't know what the developers were  intending. Instead of typing in the four-letter code for the spell, you  now have to choose the spell from a list. A long list, especially as your spellcasters achieve multiple classes.They could have at least put them in alphabetical order.There are a lot of ways to get NPC assistants in the game. I've found half a dozen figurines that will summon them, sometimes wandering monsters offer to join me, and there are several spells that conjure them. What I've noticed is that these monsters are nigh indestructible. A figurine gave me a \"Molten Man\" with an AC of -12 and 146 hit points. I've had him for two levels and he hasn't come close to dying.I think in real life I'd be suspicious of this offer.The ability to save in the dungeons, while beneficial on the surface, potentially removes a lot of the challenge inherent in the first game. There, you felt a real tension as you explored the dungeons, taking care not to stray too far too fast, watching your hit points and spell points. While I have been forcing myself to take slain characters for resurrection rather than reloading the game, I decided that when my entire party is wiped out, I'll allow myself to reload rather than trying to create dummy characters and resurrect them all from the adventurer's guild.Along these lines, one level of the dungeon had a couple of doors that said, \"Those who enter this door will never leave through it.\" Entering takes you to a dark level with no exit in which you take constant damage while moving. Lesson learned: heed the warnings on doors.Honestly, if you saw this in real life, you wouldn't open the door, right?I don't know if the creators were afraid of copyright infringement suits or something, but none of the monsters from I or II appear in this game. This game features a slate of creatures found in no other game. So far, I've counted about 15 different monster portraits, with each portrait standing for at least half a dozen monsters. For instance, the goofy looking thing below is shown as a \"Hookfang,\" but the same portrait serves for \"Blackclaws\" and \"Greenclaws\" as well. Since these creatures are all unique to The Bard's Tale III, I suppose a dedicated player would keep track of their names, toughness, and special abilities to help better plan combat tactics. Alas, I have lacked such motivation.I need to work on better insults.In another departure from previous games, not all of the dungeon levels are the same size. The first level was only 13x13, for instance, while the second was 22x22.There is precious little in the levels, aside from random encounters, traps, dark squares, spinners, and other such dangers. The first two levels of the dungeon, for all of their twists and turns, served only one purpose: to tell me that the word CHAOS, when spoken to the Mad God's priests, would allow me access to the deeper levels. This whole \"message-scrawled-on-the-wall\" thing is a staple of early CRPGs, found in Wizardry, The Bard's Tale, and Might & Magic, among others. But it does break the immersion a bit, doesn't it? I mean, why would the bad guys go and write their code words on the walls?Was this written by some helpful fifth columnist in Tarjan's horde?The game theoretically introduces an automap feature. I say \"theoretically\" because it doesn't really work. I think it's supposed to black out places you haven't been, but calling up the automap seems to either 1) show me the entire map of the level regardless of whether I've been there; 2) show a map with random parts--including places I've been--blacked out. I haven't abandoned my Excel maps.This is what the automap showed me before I had even gone anywhere.The rogue's attack abilities are a nice touch. I'm not sure if they're new to this game since I didn't have a rogue in the first Bard's Tale. Essentially, the rogue can take one combat round to hide in shadows. If successful, he can attempt a sneak attack against a foe on the next round. The sneak attack has a decent chance of being a critical hit (instant death). He can also do this from the fifth rank--a rank from which you can normally not attack. Also related to the rogue, the game follows Wizardry's tradition of having the rogue first identify the trap and then attempt to disarm it by typing in the trap's name. This can get annoying during repeat failures, when I have to type \"poison blades\" six or seven times. Inevitably, I screw it up (\"pison blades\") and set it off.The thief makes a back stab.I'm actually a little disturbed by how quickly I'm leveling up. I guess I had the erroneous impression that III restarted all characters at Level 1 for a reason, but the game seems bent on ensuring that I'll have Level 20 characters and arch-mages (spellcasters with all spell levels in all spellcasting classes) before the end of the first dungeon.In this posting, I probably haven't been able to successfully conceal my disappointment. I don't know why, but I was really looking forward to this game. Somehow I thought it would be a lot different than II, but it's not. The lack of scripted encounters, the needlessly large dungeons, the constant combat, and the insanely rapid leveling have conspired to create a game that is fundamentally boring. The first Bard's Tale wasn't a whole lot different in gameplay, but it was somehow different in quality. It was more compact, for one thing. There were more NPCs and scripted encounters in dungeons, and the maps had a little more thematic sense to them. Compare the largely random map above to this one from the first game, for instance:\u00a0 See how you can discern a pattern in this map? There was a consistent theme on this level with undead, and the walls led you inextricably to the location of the level's main encounter. Not so in the maps so far in The Bard's Tale III.But the forced waiting has been a real benefit to me during a couple of days when I had to get some real work done, so in that sense, it's been just want I needed. And perhaps I'm being a bit premature--I understand that after this starter dungeon, I get to explore other worlds and stuff. That must be cool, right?"}, {"title": "Game 47: The Bard's Tale III: Thief of Fate (1988)", "date": "Tuesday, February 1, 2011", "text": "This is one of several games in which the title could be rearranged almost any way and it would still sound like a good game.

This is the first crossing since 2400 A.D., which brought us to 1987 back in October. I played 19 games for 1987, and there are 31 on the list for 1988. Better get a-questing.As you may recall, my experience with The Bard's Tale II didn't go so well. At first I found it too easy, then simply boring because of the lack of variety in the dungeons (the \"snare\" sections being the one exception). Then I ragequit when I realized I hadn't saved my game properly and I would have to go back to the dungeons I already completed. I decided to return to it after Might & Magic, but I found Might & Magic to be such a superior game in every way that I couldn't face going back to The Bard's Tale II. I always felt bad about that, like if I had played it in a better mood, things would have been different.I was glad when, a few days ago, Kyle Haight linked me to this Matt Barton interview with Rebecca (\"Burger\") Heineman, the programmer behind The Bard's Tale and The Bard's Tale III. It does suggest that because of a rift in the creative team, The Bard's Tale II was fundamentally different, and harder, than the first one, and that perhaps III will be better. Heineman also indicates that Dragon Wars, coming up in 1989, was supposed to be The Bard's Tale IV.In any event, after a string of quasi-CRPGs and console ports, I'm happy to be playing a multi-character Wizardry descendant again. 1988 promises to be a great year for classic series. In addition to this, we get the beginnings of two Dungeons & Dragons series: Heroes of the Lance and Pool of Radiance, Might & Magic II, Ultima V, and the fifth Wizardry.The back story to The Bard's Tale III is mildly horrifying: After your party's defeat of Mangar in the first game, they immediately ditched Skara Brae to find the pieces of the Destiny Wand in a neighboring kingdom. Well, no sooner had the adventurers left the liberated city than the Mad God Tarjan, the dead Mangar's master, showed up and interrupted the festivities by sending his minions to kill everyone (\"thanks, adventurers, but we rather liked Mangar better\"). Garth of Garth's Emporium and Roscoe from Roscoe's Energy Emporium were crushed under their own shops. One of the city's elders managed to get a message to the adventurers, warning them that if Tarjan is successful, he will dominate life across multiple dimensions.Gameplay hasn't really changed much since II (which hadn't changed much since I). Even most of the spells are the same, although there are two new spell classes: geomancer (converted fighters), and chronomancer (needed to move across dimensions). Races (humans, elves, dwarves, hobbits, half-elves, half-orcs, and gnomes) and other classes (warrior, paladin, hunter, monk, bard, rogue, conjurer, magician) are the same, but the creators decided to allow females at last. You can transfer characters from either of the two original games, but I decided to start fresh with newbies. My idea is that my original party was slain trying to defeat the second game, and the message intended for them has instead fallen into the hands of a group of rank amateurs.Females finally qualify as adventurers in the third edition.I struggled a bit with character creation. I like to lead with a paladin, but I remembered how good hunters and monks are at high levels. It seems wrong to play without a bard, and the manual warns you that you really need a rogue (who now comes with a new backstab ability) and you definitely need a chronomancer. Knowing that I'll have to sacrifice at least one spellcaster to the chronomancer class (who loses knowledge of all previous spells), I need at least one other. Technically, you can have seven party members, but you really need to leave a slot free for NPCs and summoned creatures. Thus, after some wrangling, I went with:Sir Tor, a male human paladin. I wanted to do a half-orc paladin but the game, influenced by D&D, I guess, won't let you.Ambrosius, a male dwarven monk (yes, dwarven monk, Mr. Autocorrect, not \"dwarfish\").Vaux, a female halfling thiefEssyltt, a female half-elven bardMabon the Mad, a male elven conjurerEscorducarla, a female gnomish magicianFrom a purely tactical perspective, it would probably have been a better idea to choose a hunter instead of the paladin, and to jettison the bard entirely, but from a roleplaying perspective I like this group better. One of these days I'll have the guts to play with a party of all one class or something, but it doesn't sound like that's possible in this game.The game starts you with no gold--probably because, with Garth crushed, there's nowhere to spend it--but each character does have some basic equipment.We begin in a refugee camp outside Skara Brae, with the camp taking the place of the adventurer's guild from previous games. Right next door is a tavern (these refugees have their priorities straight) and the bartender says that there still might be some treasures stashed in the nearby ruins of Skara Brae. I began by mapping the fairly limited out door area...\u00a0 ...which features the camp, the tavern, a temple, the ruins of Skara Brae, and a bunch of locations that promise to become important later, such as an \"old dwarven mine\" and a \"peaceful grove,\" but the game wants me to explore Skara Brae first. Nonsensically, the outdoor section doubles back on itself. Walk 20 steps east from the refugee camp, and you'll find yourself approaching the camp again from the west. The game is apparently set on The Little Prince's planet.\u00a0 Skara Brae is indeed in ruins, and much smaller than in the first game, although some features like the neverending street are still present. There are, as far as I can tell, only four buildings of consequence: the review board (where a single old man levels you up and sells spells), the Mad God's temple, some building that gives you the ability to search it but doesn't seem to turn up anything when you do, and the \"Interplay House,\" where you can get the game's credits.\"His life impedes my efforts to stave off disaster\" is a nice, roundabout way of saying, \"kill him.\"The old guy at the review board provides the first quest: to enter the dungeons beneath the Mad God's temple and slay one of his devotees, Brilhasti Ap Tarj. Entering the Mad God's dungeon is done the same way as in The Bard's Tale: you give the name of the Mad God (\"Tarjan\") to the priest. Incidentally, it is in this game that if you give the name of the Mad God as \"Burger,\" you get a bit of a joke:\u00a0 As I said, combat is identical to The Bard's Tale II. Your first four characters can attack; the rear two or three must cast spells or use items. Enemies can approach at a range, and if you enter combat with multiple groups of monsters, some may be off in the distance while others are directly in front of you. You can only attack the ones directly in front of you, and a favorite tactic of enemy spellcasters is to keep summoning creatures from 30 feet away, preventing you from ever reaching them except with your own spells.Doesn't \"miasmal\" mean \"vaporous\"?My characters began at Level 1 and were slain a lot before I realized that the bard song called \"Sir Robin's Tune\" (I think I am alone among geeks in absolutely hating that movie) allows you to always flee combat. This means that as long as I kept my bard's throat soothed with mead, she could play the song constantly and I could effectively pick and choose which combats to fight and which to avoid. In short order, I had my characters up to Level 5. Healing is expensive but spell points regenerate in sunlight, so my spellcasters can generally keep my party members in good shape.The graphics don't seem to have improved much since The Bard's Tale II, although the character portraits and enemy animations look a little more advanced. Unless I have something set up wrong in DOSBox, the game is curiously devoid of sound effects except for the bard's tunes.The game features monsters of unexpected power.After I mapped the outdoor area and Skara Brae, I started exploring the Mad God's temple. The monsters took about 17 levels in badass right away. About halfway through the first level, my entire party was wiped out by a \"goresucker\" (my party had a different name for the beast, although oddly similar) who proved capable of belching fireballs. The particularly annoying thing is that the game manual doesn't give you a rundown of creatures, the monsters are unique to this game so you really don't know what to expect, and the game uses the same portraits for several monsters each. There was really no way to know that the Jabba-the-Huttish creature known as a \"bloodfiend\" in the outdoor area would turn into a merchant of death called a \"goresucker\" the moment I hit the first dungeon.That actually doesn't sound so bad.When your party is wiped out, the characters are transferred to the refugee camp, where a relief party can attempt to resurrect them. This takes more gold than I had, so I dumped them all and started over with new characters of the same names and classes. This time, I'll bring myself to a higher level before attempting the dungeons.When I blog tomorrow, I should have a better sense of the overall gameplay and whether I actually like it or not. If I really hustle, I might be able to get this one done in a week, leaving me about one week more to get the four other games I need to...damn, I'm not going to make it, am I?"}, {"title": "Zeliard: Not Enough Dexterity", "date": "Monday, January 31, 2011", "text": "A giant chicken (\"Pollo\") is the third boss fight.The CRPG Addict does not have very good hand-eye coordination. It is for this reason that I play CRPGs and not platformers. So when Zeliard started offering up series of complex jumping puzzles, I knew I was in trouble. And when I failed at the same jumping puzzle literally 47 times in a row, I knew that this was not the game for me.I'm no good at these things.It's too bad because Zeliard is a cute little game. Every level is comfortably similar. Levels feature pairs of interlocking maps. The first level had two caves: Malicia and Peligro; the third had two forests: Madera (\"wood\") and Riza (\"crimp?\"); the fourth two ice caverns: Glacial (\"icy\") and Escarcha (\"frost\"). The two maps are accessed through a series of doors. I had a hell of a time mapping these before I realized that the doors are color-coded to help you create your map. I am color blind. I can't stand games that rely on color for key elements, especially subtle variations like red and green and blue and purple, which this game uses (my wife helped me out). Seriously, would yellow, blue, white, and black have been difficult?The ice caverns on Level 4.Anyway, each level also has doors leading to a town, with names suitable to the levels' features. The ice caverns led to a town called Helado (\"ice\"), for instance. In each town, NPCs give you clues as to how to beat the levels.To win this level, I somehow needed to find my way up to these shoes.To get through the levels, you have to follow a deceptively linear path by going through the right doors, picking up keys, negotiating platform puzzles, and finding special items like the Hero's Crest on Level 3 and the Ruzeria Shoes on Level 4. At the end of each level is a boss beast. I fought a crab, a squid, and a chicken, and I understand the rest include a fish head and a dragon.A shield I never got to buy.Each town has a slightly more powerful weapon, armor, and potion selection, and each visit to a new town rewards you with a new spell; my last was the Fuego (\"fire\") spell. I never got very good at casting those. I kept accidentally pounding CTRL when I went to hit ALT (the spell key), which meant that the Google Desktop search box would pop up and as I frantically tried to close it and return to the DOSBox window, the monsters would kill me. Remember: bad hand-eye coordination.I'll try to remember that.Dying causes you to resurrect with no gold (unless you deposited some in the bank) back at the first level. Fighting my way back through the first three levels was too much even for my draconian rules, and I generally reloaded when I died.If you want a good laugh, you can watch me try and fail to get across these platforms a bunch of times before ultimately dying. Notable is how at 00:58, I manage to miss the blob with two Fuego spells and how at 1:22 and 01:40, when I'm trying to frantically jump out of the spikes, I keep swinging my sword--the \"jump\" and \"attack\" keys are nowhere near each other. But the crowning moment comes at 02:55, when having finally managed to make it across the platforms, I then still manage to just fall off. I really am this bad.The game, coupled with a comment that PetrusOctavianus made in my review of The Bard's Tale has prompted me to think a lot about the relationship between dexterity, strategy, and probability (or luck) in computer games. RPGs almost always have a random element--that's what the polyhedron dice are for--but mostly they depend on the strategies you pursue (character development and battle tactics) to affect the probabilities in your favor. A good CRPG need not require any manual dexterity, but if it does, I guess that's what we call an \"action RPG.\" Games that feature only manual dexterity are platformers.I can get through most action RPGs because the dexterity part generally just involves pointing and swinging and maybe executing some kind of combo. But even if you're inept at that part, you can balance it through weapon and character improvements. If I can't seem to coordinate my attacks in Diablo II, I just need to level grind for a while and then my clumsiness is offset by greater power. But there's just no way to compensate for lack of dexterity in a jumping puzzle.Anyway, I tried a lot more times than you saw in the video, and there were similar puzzles that kept me occupied for an hour or so prior to this. I can't imagine that they get easier as the game goes on, so I'm going to move on to the familiar comforts of The Bard's Tale III, which requires no manual dexterity at all. If you're really interested in seeing the end, a YouTube user named saberkitty119 has uploaded a full playthrough; the final two sections are here (this one includes the last combats with the dragon and Jashiin) and here (the end game text). Duke Garland saves the princess, of course, and for some reason he just saunters off into the sunset even though she clearly wants to express her gratitude in a Cinemax After Dark sort of way. And yet another game bails on the chance to feature the first CRPG romance.Game world: Not outrageously original, but it's got a decent story (5). All character development follows the same path; you don't get to create or customize the character, there are no choices to make, and leveling basically just increases hit points and spell points (2). There are lots of NPCs who teach you about the world and your quest, but no interaction (4). Encounters and foes are of the Mario variety with no role-playing, but they do respawn so you can level-grind if you want (3). Magic and combat are action-oriented with few tactics involved even against the bosses (3). You can buy weapons, armor, and magic, and upgrading any of them is satisfying; you can find some equipment in dungeons. The descriptions that shopkeepers give of the items is a nice touch (5). The economy, based on \"almas,\" helps you buy needed stuff, and I never hit a point where I didn't need money (5).It'll be a while before I can afford that honor shield.There is one main quest and no side quests nor any way to roleplay it (2). Graphics and sound are quite good, and the controls are fine, although I wish they'd made ESC something other than \"pause\"; I kept hitting it when I was trying to get out of a dialog window (5). Gameplay is very linear and non-replayable. Ultimately, I found it too difficult because of the manual dexterity issue. Younger players with better wrists might find it too easy (2).The final score of 36 isn't too bad for a game that really isn't a CRPG. But seriously: this is the seventh game in a row whose CRPG creds are a little fishy. Time to cross into 1988 and try one that no one doubts."}, {"title": "Game 46: Zeliard (1987)", "date": "Sunday, January 30, 2011", "text": "A very pretty opening screen using EGA graphics.ZeliardJapanGame Arts Co. Ltd. (developer and publisher)Released in 1987 for PC-88, 1988 for Sharp X1, 1990 for DOSDate Started: 29 January 2011\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 As you might have seen in the comments on Sorcerian, Zeliard nearly didn't make it. Commenter Sean questioned whether it was really a CRPG, and I took a look at both MobyGames's and Wikipedia's lists (I thought), concluded that no one said it was, and chucked it. But then Arcanum pointed out that it was, in fact, on the Wikipedia list, so I re-added it, gnashing my teeth a bit because I wanted to get to The Bard's Tale III.Well, I'm not sorry I re-added it. It's fun. It won't become a part of my soul or anything, but it's a good play. And since you gain experience and levels and such, I'm happy to grant it at least quasi-CRPG status.The story of the game is told in an interminable but well-animated sequence at the beginning: in days of yore, the kings of Zeliard imprisoned a demon named Jashiin deep within the earth. Thousands of years later, he has awakened.Bad kitty!Calling himself \"The Emperor of Chaos,\" he lays waste to Zeliard with a storm of sand, and he turns the beautiful princess Felicia into stone (\"a lovely and terrifying symbol of my awakening\").Really not all that terrifying.The Guardian Spirit of Zeliard visits the king and tells him that a brave warrior must venture into the labyrinths beneath the kingdom and recover the nine Tears of the Esmesanti, holy crystals that can reverse the damage, and slay Jashiin.\u00a0 The king despairs about where such a hero will come from, but it turns out that I, Duke Garland, have been following the holy spirit's summons, and I show up in Zeliard at just the right time.\u00a0 As I visit the king, Jashiin appears and taunts us both, but I give some back good. The king gives me 1,000 gold pieces, I purchase some weapons, armor, and potions, and soon I'm hacking through vermin (yes, the first creature I slew was a rat) in the underground.Or you could just give me the absolute best equipment in your kingdom, instead of making me buy it.Gameplay is of the side-scrolling platform variety, and in between slashing at creatures, I have to navigate mazes and jumping puzzles. Combat is fairly basic action-oriented hacking, lent some extra tactical dimensions by the multi-layered nature of the dungeon. Sometimes you have to jump to reach your foes, and you always have to watch to make sure they're not about to fall on you and knock you off a ledge or a rope. In this, the game is a hybrid between an action CRPG and a platformer.From the starting town, I fought my way through the caverns of Malicia and found myself in an underground town called Satono, where I was welcomed as the first visitor in a long time (no word on how they manage to survive without plants and sunlight). From there, I cut through the caves of Peligro to the forest town of Bosque.\u00a0 All towns have the same shops: weapons, magic, an inn, a bank, and a sage. There are also selections of NPCs who give you hints as to what you're facing in the next dungeon.NPCs give hints as to the upcoming dungeons.As you kill creatures, you collect little balls of their essence called  \"alma,\" which banks happily buy from you for 4-8 gold pieces. NPCs suggest  that the towns use this energy to create magic items and improve their  defenses. Sages serve the triple purpose of giving you spells (you get a  new one at each sage), leveling you up, and saving the game.Leveling up at the sage.Equipment is confined to swords and shields, and every town had one slightly better model. Shields get progressively damaged as you fight, and eventually they break. You can repair them at weapon shops or with a special potion.You pick up keys, potions, and treasures throughout the dungeons.As I said, the dungeons so far have been full primarily of vermin: slugs, bats, rats, and toads. It appears that at the end of each dungeon is a different boss creature guarding one of the Tears. So far I've defeated two: a giant crab and a giant land squid.This is going to make a lot of bisque. Yes, I am aware that not all of my captions are home runs.Duke Garland has no attributes except health and a fixed number of castings for each spell. This is partly what puts the game in \"quasi-CRPG\" territory, but he does collect experience (hidden) for each kill, and gain levels that affect his maximum hit points.Here's a brief video showing the game play from the town of Santoro to the caverns of Peligro.Miscellaneous things:In the opening cut scenes, Duke Garland just looks like a regular guy, but during gameplay it looks a lot like he has furry, pointy ears (look as he climbs the ropes in the video).Though the game is of Japanese origin, most of the object and place names in the English version are Spanish. \"Alma,\" the valuable energy you collect from slain foes, means \"soul.\" The caverns are called \"Malicia\" (malice), \"Peligro\" (danger), and \"Madera\" (wood). One of the towns is \"Bosque\" (forest), and a spell is \"Espada\" (sword).Shopkeepers, if you ask them, will give a description of the items they sell. This isn't quite the detail of the write-ups we get in Might & Magic VI-VIII or the Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale series, but it's a nice start--a first, I believe.Zeliard was developed by Game Arts for Japanese PCs and adapted to DOS by Sierra in 1990. (Sierra also adapted Sorcerian; I guess porting JRPGs was a bit of forte of theirs.) Because this version is a few years later than the original, the graphics and sound take full advantage of the hardware of the time. The images are rather lovely, and the sound and music edge just north of \"tolerable\" (which is actually quite good for this era). Like Falcom, Game Arts specialized primarily in console games; I believe the only other offering of theirs on my list is Grandia II in 2000.I'm not sure whether I'll play this to the end, but I'll probably at least give it a second posting. Although my addiction is primarily to CRPGs, the occasional jumping-on-moving-platforms-over-a-pit-of-spikes puzzle is fun.Briefly fun.Wow, this is an image-heavy posting, isn't it? I don't know why some days I'm so enamored of screen shots."}, {"title": "The Ancient Land of Ys: Won! (and Final Rating)", "date": "Saturday, January 29, 2011", "text": "There's no \"congratulations\" screen, so this will have to do.Wow, right? I didn't expect it to be over that fast, either. But it actually took longer than you might think, as I essentially played it for 16 hours straight yesterday.As you can see from the screenshot, my name isn't \"Adol\" after all, it's \"Arick.\" I didn't find this out until late in the game, when someone addressed me. But it seems like all of the proper names changed between the original versions and the DOS version. The villain in at least one console version, for instance, is Dekt, not Malificus. I suppose that's to be expected when (as we covered yesterday) the very title of the game changed for the DOS port.Anyway, what I took to be the \"opening area\" of the game--the city, a nearby village, a cave, and a palace--was in fact the \"only area\" of the game, and the side quests I got at the beginning, which I took to be representative of a slew of side quests that would be forthcoming, were the only side quests. The game was still bigger than it seemed--much more vertical than horizontal. The cave, the palace, and the ending tower all had multiple levels and multiple bosses.I suspect this would actually suck in battle.I didn't take great notes or capture copious screenshots, I'm afraid. I was just trying to plow through it. Getting to the end was a process of finding a slew of items in various treasure chests, including a sword, armor, and shield of silver; keys; special items like a rod and a hammer; necklaces and rings that would allow passage into otherwise-forbidden areas; and so on. There was a lot of backtracking involved including a particularly annoying bit where I got all the way to the top of the tower and the endgame, only to find that I needed to turn around and go back down most of the tower to get an amulet from a guy in a dungeon. That backtracking took almost 90 minutes by itself.I thought this might be heading for the first example of a CRPG romance (the one on the left, wankers), but this game wasn't quite that sophisticated.At one point, I rescued a damsel from the palace named Fiina. She had lost her memory but turned out to be one of the ancient goddesses of Ys. The game could have done something with this, but it doesn't--Malificus just drops this information on you at the end. I should point out, because I don't think I did before, that there are lots of NPCs in the game, but there are no dialog options; you just read what they say.Combat never got easy, but increasingly powerful weapons and armor helped, as did a magic ring that gradually restored my health even indoors. Aside from the backtracking, five things annoyed me about the game:Most of the \"side quests\" turned out to be interlocking bits of the main quest. For instance, the recovery of the Rodane seed was necessary to talk to a Rodane tree and recover a silver shield needed for the final battle. So that still leaves Might & Magic with the only true \"side quests\" so far.Upon entry to the final tower, there was one of those tiresome \"taken prisoner\" scenes in which I lost all my silver items. I had to slowly recover them from chests in the tower later.Here's an original plot device. I wonder if there's a way out of this cell?The game allows you to collect healing potions, but it doesn't allow you to use them (or access your inventory at all) when in combat with bosses, when you most need them.I maxed out my experience points way before the end of the game. That is very annoying--there should always be reasons to kill more enemies. I maxed out the gold, too, and instead of freezing it at the max, the game flipped it over to 0! Fortunately, by that time there was nothing to buy (another thing I don't like).Oddly enough, the max number of experience points is the same as the max number of rows in Excel 2003, and the max hit points is the same as the max number of columns!*In a lot of the dungeons, you have to take doorways in the southern end of rooms, but very often you can't see, or can only barely see, the doorway at the edge of the screen. This was responsible for a lot of my backtracking, as I thought I'd thoroughly explored certain levels when in fact I had missed huge sections.Can you see that doorway just south of me?Balancing all of this: the game was fairly short. And the boss combats (one to retrieve each book) were quite challenging, each requiring some new tactic to avoid attacks and land my own attacks.This double-headed thing could only be damaged when its two heads came together. In the meantime, I had to avoid its spinning fireballs.I had to replay the endgame seven or eight times before I finally defeated Malificus, who had transported me to a platform flying through the firmament and was flying around, shooting fireballs at me. Every time I hit him, another piece disappeared from the platform, so I had to avoid both his fireballs and falling down the holes. I kept trying to record it, but since I kept dying, I eventually gave up. Here's a recording of that scene that ends with me falling off the platform:And here's a recording that picks up after I finally kill Malificus and see the end game:By the way, I figured out later that a lot of the boss combats would have been simpler if I'd cranked the CPU speed in DOSBox down to an era-accurate level.As is my wont, since the gameplay for Ys only took two sessions, I'll do a quick GIMLET right here in this posting.The game's backstory is somewhat nonsensical (really, what does this metal have to do with anything?) and its trappings are undistinguished fantasy fare. The explorable world is very limited--more a \"small hamlet of Ys\" than an ancient land. On the plus side, your actions do affect permanent changes in the game world, and the NPCs acknowledge it (4).There is no character creation: everyone starts playing Arick with the same statistics and equipment. Leveling is swift and satisfying in the first half of the game and then suddenly (and maddeningly) freezes to a halt at about the halfway mark. This is one of the few games of the era to give you experience point rewards for quests (3). NPC Interaction is important--you learn valuable things from them, and some of them are interesting--but it is all one-way (5).NPC \"interaction.\"Regular foes vary only by icon and toughness, and I didn't know what most of their names were, but the boss foes are quite original, and figuring out the best tactics to defeat them was slightly fun. This is another game where the enemies constantly respawn, but to no real benefit since the experience and gold stops doing you any good (4). There is no magic in the game (aside from a couple items), and combat involves charging into creatures, with the added tactical complexity of trying to achieve the right angle--interesting, but not enough to redeem the combat system (2).Boss fights were challenging and interesting; the rest of the combat was not.You have a basic variety of equipment, but it is all found at fixed locations, and none of it is dropped by foes (3). The economy is maddening: although you need money at the beginning of the game, after you've purchased a few fundamental items, there is no reason to keep collecting all of the gold that the enemies offer you (3). The game has a main quest and fooled me into thinking it also had side quests. There is only one ending to the main quest and no way to role-play it (2).Graphics are decent enough, if a bit small. Sound is the bloopish variety of the time. The controls are extremely basic, as you would expect from a console port, but intuitive enough (4). Gameplay is mostly linear, given the limited game world, and there would be no reason to replay it. The boss fights do add a satisfying level of challenge, and the game doesn't overstay its welcome (5).The final score of 35 seems about right. I wouldn't have wanted to play it for much longer, and the score would have been much lower without the challenge and tactics of the seven or eight boss fights, but it was an acceptable way to pass a couple of CRPG sessions.Next stop: The Bard's Ta...no, wait. Arcanum had to go and do some research. We have to do Zeliard first.*That was a joke.

They are apparently going to be a big part of my life from now on. I was having fun the last few days, blazing through some minor titles on my way to 1988, but there's no half-assing this one. Unlike Sorcerian, Ys has a full main quest. One last dragon I have to slay before I can enjoy the rewards of the 1988 golden age.The Ys opening town.Like Sorcerian, Ys  is fundamentally a console game, requiring a minimum number of  controls--basically the directional pad and two keys for inventory and  status. I would say something like \"the influence of The Legend of Zelda,  which came out the previous year, is obvious,\" except that I know next  to nothing about the Japanese CRPG market and never played Zelda  except for maybe two hours as a 13-year-old, so I'm worried I don't  know what I'm talking about. [Later edit: I was right about not knowing what I was talking about. See LordKarnov42's contributions in the comments.] I should point out that unlike Zelda (as I understand it), the character in Ys  does gain experience points and levels. There really can't be any  question as to whether this game is a proper CRPG. I'm not saying it's a  great one, but it's in the right category.The back story of Ys is dripping with metaphor: the land was once peaceful and happy, but when a farmer discovered a precious magic metal called \"kureria\" (the uses are left vague), the land was stricken with sudden wealth, income inequality, and natural disasters. Sick of the destruction, the people of Ys gathered up all the kureria, stuffed it into a vault in the Holy Shrine of Sarumon (yes, really), and erected magic statues to guard it. Things returned to normal. But many years later, an evil wizard named Malificus has seized the six Books of Ys, which hold the secret to kureria and has taken the metal. \"Only by recovering the six Books of Ys can the people hope to regain their land and end the evil reign of Malificus.\" But five of the books are being guarded by \"huge monsters\" and Malificus himself holds the sixth.Ys is one of the few CRPGs of this era to feature side quests.Neither the manual nor the game tells you who you are, but I gather from the MobyGames summary that the character is Adol Christian, and the starting town is called Minea. You don't get the main quest right away. Instead, you get a few side quests from exploring Minea and a village nearby. Already I've been tasked with:Dealing with some robbers who have been harassing the bartender.Find a seed called the Rodane seed.Find a stolen harmonica for a distressed songwriter.Recover a lost ring for a one-eyed man in the bar.Recover the Silver Bells, treasured symbols of the village, from a band of thieves.Little NPCs wandering around the town help you with these quests by giving you hints. You have to talk to them through the cumbersome method of standing in their paths until they run into you. For instance, after I got the quest from the one-eyed man, an NPC told me:\u00a0 This was the first quest I solved, though it took me a while to kill enough monsters to get the gold needed to buy the ring from the pawnshop owner. With the reward from the one-eyed man, I bought a proper suit of armor and shield, at which point I was apparently equipped enough to get the main quest (or at least the recovery of the first book) from Sara the Fortune Teller. More on that below.Um...what are those \"many things?\"When I played Sorcerian, I lamented about how basic the combat was, involving simply mashing the spacebar until the enemy dies. Well, Falcom apparently decided that even that was too much for Ys. In this game, there isn't even an attack button; you attack enemies by charging directly into them, much like in NetHack. There are, however, some tactics to this combat: you do more damage, and avoid damage yourself, if you charge into them from the back or side instead of the front. This is, in fact, the only way to survive at the opening level, when you have only 20 hit points. You thus have to dexterously dance around your enemies, watching their movements and looking for openings. Much more interesting than Sorcerian. Once you have a shield, head-on charges become a little less damaging. In the comments to Wizard Warz, LordKarnov42 clued me in that enemies can't hit you if you're slightly offset from their path of movement, but still in contact with them, although getting this just right (especially in dungeon corridors) is difficult.Outdoors with tiny little enemies.If you can survive combat with a single creature, you just need to run off to a safe corner and stand still for a bit, and your hit points recharge fairly quickly (at least, outdoors). Despite this, I have died many, many times since starting the game; some of the enemies are brutal. Unfortunately, their little icons (everything in the game is tiny) don't correspond to the pictures in the game manual, so I can only guess at what I'm fighting outside the walls of Minea. Black knights and mutant dwarves, I think. After I gained a few levels, with consequent increases in strength and hit points, the battles went a lot faster. Enemies that used to take a few hits now simply disappear with a satisfying bloop as I charge over them.The inventory screen.There are a number of things I like about the game, starting with the number of quests, and the fact that you get experience point rewards and gold for completing them. These seem like such staples of CRPGs these days that it's easy to forget their comparative rarity in this era. How many games so far in my blog have featured side quests? Exactly two: Might & Magic and Sorcerian, and it's hard to count the latter's as \"side quests\" because there was no main quest. Leveling is a process of grinding your way through dozens and dozens of respawning enemies, and yet it's still fairly quick, and the results are satisfying. Finally, the game has a reasonably complex inventory of swords, armor, shields, magic items, and special items.The beginning of the main quest.My gameplay so far has centered on Minea and its environs. As I said, I solved the ring quest right away, but most of the other side quests involve defeating a band of thieves who have holed up in the mountains. Meanwhile, Sara wants me to recover a Book of Ys from a shrine in the mountains, but my first few trips there show that I'm not quite strong enough to defeat the big bad.The video below shows a little bit of the gameplay, including combat. As you'll hear, the sound effects are still a bit primitive. There's music in the game (as Taylor pointed out yesterday, much inferior in the DOS version), but oddly, you can only have music or sound effects, not both. As you'll see, I accidentally managed to record myself getting killed.Before I sign off, I should note the correct pronunciation is \"ees,\" and Ys is an ancient mythical city, said to have existed on the shores of Brittany. Without giving too much away, I have a lot of experience with the mythology of this region, and I was only vaguely aware of it (there are a lot of local legends like this), so it's amusing that a Japanese company made it the centerpiece for their game series. I suppose all it takes is one employee who once read a book. Or is it just a coincidence? (Obviously, the original name would have been in Japanese.)The Ys series includes nine games going right up to 2006. Most were developed for consoles and Japanese PCs; only a handful were ported to DOS or PCs, so we won't be visiting the land of Ys again until Ys V: The Ark of Napishtim in 2003 and Ys Origin in 2006. I hope there's not a lot of plot in between."}, {"title": "Game 44: Wizard Warz (1987)", "date": "Thursday, January 27, 2011", "text": "Oh, good.

Wizard Warz is not remotely a CRPG. I'll grant you that the interface looks vaguely CRPG-ish, but it doesn't have enough of the elements that make up a CRPG: no character creation, no development except the acquisition of an occasional new spell, no inventory (okay, no player-controlled inventory), action-based combat rather than tactical combat, no NPCs, and so on. Really, MobyGames needs to get its classification act together. Their own definition of \"role-playing game\" is: \"any game for which character development is the main driving gameplay mechanic.\" [Ed. This definition has changed several times since this was posted.]And yet, I'm going to count it as a CRPG and give it my six hours because I want to get to 50 games before my first anniversary (February 15), and with The Bard's Tale III coming up, I need all of the one-shots I can get.The story is that you are a wizard's apprentice. As you approach your graduation, your master sets out the history of the land: it was once peaceful, prosperous, and generous, but an invading horde took advantage of that generosity and massacred the land's leaders at a banquet. The land's allies tried to sail to its rescue, but the invaders summoned seven powerful wizards to hold off the rescuers with evil summoned creatures. Now, decades later, the land is ruled by fear.My quest will proceed in three stages: first, to slay all of the beasts of the island where I currently reside, using their trophies to convince the capital city to aid me; second, survive a series of challenges to ensure I am strong enough to face the seven wizards; third, travel to each of the seven wizards' castles and defeat them and their guardians.\"Character creation.\"Character creation consists of assigning a sex and choosing four out of 10 spells to put in my spellbook: fireball, wall of ice, icy blast, spit, wall of fire, rock shower, magic missile, wall of stone, and slow. The \"wall\" spells are defensive spells. Once you select the four spells, you are set loose on the island to kill the six evil beasts. The game window is rather tiny.Audrey II from Little Shop of Horrors! Two days in a row!When you near the beasts, their portraits appear in the right side of the screen, growing more solid the closer they are. Once you run into them, the game switches to an arena where you engage in battle with the enemy. Curiously, although the beasts all look properly beastly in their portraits, they appear as the same little wizard in a cloak once you actually get into combat.Portrait looks like a werewolf, icon looks like a little girl.Combat consists of pointing towards them and firing your chosen spell. Certain spells work better against certain enemies, so it's best to have a good mix at the outset. The pointing and firing is a bit of a problem, though. The game was really meant for a joystick, and it's hard to be dexterous enough with the number pad (at least, for me) to hit your target, especially since the diagonal keys don't work. You can move diagonally by pressing two keys at once--for instance, 8 and 6 (up and right) moves you northeast--but needless to say this is a bit cumbersome.How did the crown fit over his horns?You have three meters to watch: physical, spiritual, and mental  energy. All of them are depleted by casting spells in their associated categories or by taking damage from spells in those categories. If any of them reach 0, you die. Physical energy is recharged by food, and  you can transfer from either of the other categories  to physical energy, but not the other way around. I had a lot of false starts and many deaths before I realized that the towns would give me food that I could use to survive in combat.If you succeed in combat, you get some artifact from the creature. Turning in the artifact at the nearest town (there's nothing else you can do at the towns) rewards you with food, which, by increasing your physical energy, helps you win future battles. Once I realized that you could eat food in battle, I was able to defeat the six beasts: a spider, a monkey, a scorpion, a werewolf, a venus fly trap (or something like it), and some kind of water demon.This was my last.Phase 1 ended with an awesome cut scene:No, just kidding.In Phase 2, you choose what monsters you want to fight, and after you fight them, you choose whether you want a spell or attribute bonus. There are like 30 monsters and you have to beat them one at a time. I took a video of some of it.I was doing fairly well until I fought a genie who had some spell that made me forget my spells. One-by-one they all disappeared from my spellbook, leaving me offenseless and, thus, useless. I had to essentially kill myself.There's no way to save a game of Wizard Warz in progress, so I assume the whole campaign, should you succeed, won't take more than a couple hours. The control problem will likely preclude me from winning the game, but I'll keep trying for another 2.5 hours. If you're reading this, you can assume that I didn't win, because if I do, I'll return and edit this before it posts.MobyGames's entry on Wizard Warz is interesting. For something that looks like a barely-noted shareware game, it sure was ported to a lot of platforms: Amiga, Amstrad, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, and ZX Spectrum. Was there really that much demand for a light CGA action game by 1987? (Pirates! was available!) The developer is listed as Canvas, which also developed Airborne Ranger (1988), a game I remember playing with great joy on my C64, and incidentally probably much more a CRPG than Wizard Warz. [Edit: Canvas didn't develop Airborne Ranger, of course. They just ported the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum versions of it.]One way or another, some game called The Ancient Land of Ys is next.[Edit: Many years later, I returned to Wizard Warz and won it. Read the updated entry.]"}, {"title": "Game 43: Star Saga: One - Beyond the Boundary (1988)", "date": "Wednesday, January 26, 2011", "text": "Take a look: It's Andrew (\"Werdna\") Greenberg.I debated for a while about whether to do a standard entry for this game because I don't really know if I'm going to get to \"play\" it. Star Saga: One - Beyond the Boundary (yes, that is the appropriate punctuation) is the damnedest game I've encountered so far in this blog. For the last couple of weeks--in relation to Pirates!, mostly--we've been talking about what constitutes a CRPG. Well, here's another one that challenges the definition--but not because of the \"role-playing\" part. Rather, Star Saga: One might not be a CRPG because it doesn't really satisfy the \"computer\" part.Let's deal with the backstory first: the game is set in the year 2815, almost 600 years after the invention of a \"dual-axis hyperdrive\" made it possible to travel between stars. As a result, humanity colonized eight other planets in an area known as the \"Galactic Fringe.\" In 2490, however, more than half the population of the colonies was killed by an alien virus called the Space Plague. As a result, the governments of Earth and the colonies defined a border around the colonies called the Boundary. Anyone traveling beyond the Boundary would never be able to return. The Space Patrol was established to enforce this law.Each of the nine colonies is named and has a unique characteristic. Atlantis is a \"lush green world protected by strict environmental laws\"; Endaur is the seat of the government; Frontier is rugged and sparsely populated, but popular with tourists; Harvard is the colonies' center of learning; Heaven is the most densely populated planet; Leucothea is the religious headquarters (the major religion is The Final Church of Man, which sounds vaguely sinister); Monument is primarily a memorial to the Space Plague; and Norstar is a \"grimy, industrial world.\" While peace and unity reign, and the Space Patrol keeps bad things out of the colonies, humanity \"has become a bit stagnant--no new discoveries, no new challenges, and countless opportunities lost.\"The game is a weird, possibly unique, hybrid of computer and board game. It originally came in a three-pound box with several floppy disks and a dense package of character booklets, instructions, tokens, a game map, and 888 passages of text. Players--of whom there can be up to six--choose one of six characters to play, each of which has a full biography and set of goals, which you're supposed to keep secret from the other players. (They say a full game takes up to 60 hours, so I guess you're not expected to start a new game every family get-together.) All six characters have recently crossed the boundary, in their own ships, for their own purposes (for instance, Professor Lee Dambroke wants to learn about alien civilizations and Jean G. Clerc is looking for alien technology to build the ultimate spaceship). The characters do not play as a party but instead take turns and, I guess, occasionally encounter each other.For my introductory game, I chose Professor Dambroke, the xenobiologist from Harvard, and was pleased to see that the picture of my laboratory contains the alien from Aliens plus Audrey II from Little Shop of Horrors.\"The Boundary\" suddenly makes a lot of sense.Gameplay progresses something like this. You take off in your ship from your home world, study the game map, and decide where you want to go. You get 7 \"phases\" per turn, and moving between map sectors takes up one of them. The map sectors are all triangular, and you can travel to adjacent sectors across lines, but not across points.\u00a0 Thus, in the map above, I could travel from sector 116 (the center yellow one) to either 117 or 115, but not to 93 or 94; I'd have to go through 117 or 115 first.You enter your travel commands into the computer application, and it tells you the results:\u00a0 The game directs me to read two book entries: 348 and 382. Here's a snippet of 348:Approaching the planet in this system, you instruct your computer to run a geophysical survey as well as scan to see if it has any information in its computer banks on the world known as Moiran.\"I've got some data for you, boss,\" it says. \"The physical characteristics are as follows: climate, warmer than Earth; polar regions, habitable due to minimal axial tilt.\"While the computer is busy scanning its memory for any historical data it might have, you take the opportunity to view the planet first hand. From space, Moiran seems somewhat smaller than Earth and not nearly as pretty. The clouds look grey and the oceans have a brownish tint to them. All in all, a dirty-looking planet.The book goes on to tell me that there are cities, including a busy spaceport, on the planet. It turns out it was an Earth colony, cut off because of the Boundary. I head out of the spaceship and am assailed by the noxious odor of sulphur, meet with the spaceport officials \"(who speak a slightly accented Earth Standard),\" and head out to explore. At this point, the game gives me five possibilities for further action:Visit a dirty and disgusting part of the cityGo to the north pole and investigate the planet's primary industry, Phase SteelCheck out the Moiran Interstellar Shipyard for weapons systemsCheck out rumors about \"Tony the Shark,\" who runs an illegal arms and armor businessVisit \"Dee's Pleasure Palace,\" of which the game says, \"the less said about the place, the better.\"In the next turn, I can choose the action. I go to the commodities market, and the game enters into an exchange screen, in which I can exchange crystals for goods.\u00a0 I should mention at this point that the game is essentially walking me through the first seven turns--it forces you to go a predetermined route, with the book explaining how you play along the way. After this, it has me take off and go to another planet, Wellmeet, where I visit a tavern and talk with the locals.Just out of curiosity, I started a game with two players and then had them meet on the same planet. I wanted to see if the gamebook had any specific text about the encounter. But all it really does is allows them to trade items to each other.\u00a0 The role of the computer in the game is somewhat minimal. It keeps track of your inventory and status, and lets you know the outcomes of your actions (including those based on probability like, I assume, combat). But the real \"gameplay\" is in the form of the book and map. The book is highly reminiscent of the Choose Your Own Adventure series in which you read a passage, make a choice, and jump to another passage. The game is thus much more reading than \"playing.\"Although you can play with up to five other people, it strikes me as a somewhat lonely game for a group. Everyone has his own character, the interactions between them are minimal, and you're not supposed to let them see your character book or storyline. How does it end? One of the players suddenly announces, \"Well, I'm done\"? (Since I don't have any friends who know about my hobby, I guess the issue is moot.) I'd love to hear from someone who played this in person when it was new.I should mention that my own playing session so far would not have been possible without the work of one \"JJ Sonick,\" who not only scanned all of the game entries and put them into a searchable browser-based index but also created a brilliant little application that uses the game map and allows you to maneuver your little tokens around the screen. That's some real love there. [Edit: see this comment for more information about the creation of this set.]I did have some interest in exploring the mysteries of the galaxy and solving Professor Dambroke's quest of returning to Harvard with three alien abilities so cool the rest of humanity will regard them as \"magical,\" so I restarted with him and kept playing for a while. My travels took me to:Wellmet, a frontier planet that used to be the center of exploration for the human colonies before the Boundary. Now a \"Ghost World\"--one of those abandoned by the nine colonies when they established the Boundary, it comes across as a cross between Australia and Sicily; its rough-but-friendly frontier spirit is an artifact of the convicts that were shipped there by the colonies, but its politics and trade are dominated by the quasi-Mafia Families. It becomes clear here that smuggling across the Boundary is very active (despite the official word from Space Patrol) and is, in fact, a major part of the Wellmet economy. A mysterious man in Wellmet gives me data crystals that greatly expand my star map (the game comes with two maps, one that you open up after getting this information) and warns me about aliens, pirates, and \"space walls\" where hyperspace doesn't work.A portion of the larger game map.Crater, a strange planet completely enclosed by space walls. When I get there, I am captured by a tractor beam and interrogated by the locals--more colony expatriates--who are paranoid about alien invasion and have erected essentially a fortress in space. They decide I'm okay and allow me to attend a lecture on combat, after which I am forced to take a test that I fail because the instructions are in old English instead of Earth Standard.Medsun, an agrarian, low-technology planet populated by both humans and strange yellow aliens with three necks (understand this is all described in the book; there are no graphics of this). The low-key attitude of the population seems mysterious until I find that the Medsunians have a natural capability, called Phrmm, to pacify aggression, but it also works to subdue any sense of ambition or adventure. When I am taught the techniques of Phrmm, the Medsunians assume I'm going to stay and start looting my ship, but I stop them and blast off, not sure whether to regard the human populace as unwilling slaves or just stoned and happy. In any event, Phrmm turns out to be one of the \"alien abilities\" I'm looking for, so my quest is 1/3 done.I'm just showing this for the heck of it. There aren't a lot of interesting screen shots here.All of the planets featured robust bartering systems by which I could trade various units of food, medicine, \"liquids,\" munitions, armaments, cultural items, and so forth back and forth. But my inventory was so low to begin with that I hesitated to trade anything. I did hand over one of my medicine units for some munitions, then the munitions for a hand blaster.Throughout this, the computer on my ship keeps conversing with me directly (in the text, not in the computer part of the game), and I am surprised at its advanced technology, which apparently incorporates a \"three-sigma intelligence package\" and allows it to understand and answer questions in normal language, and also to volunteer information. Yes, I would like to be shocked at this level of artificial intelligence, but come on, this game is set 800 years in the future.About this point, I ran out of steam. This is fundamentally not a computer game. I mean, I could take the inventory sheet from the Lone Wolf gamebook series and put it into Microsoft Excel, but that doesn't mean I'll have created a CRPG. The long text entries are very well-written and interesting, but I don't have any sense that I'm really playing anything.I tried to jump through the entries and see if I could suss out what the ending looked like, but there are just too many of them. Here are some choice quotes that I'd love to know the scenario behind. All of them sound like candidates for the Bulwer-Lytton contest.\"You are embarrassed to admit that a four foot tall squirrel is  your equal in battle.\"\"You figure the alien ships couldn't be having an easy time tracking your ship, not with the Gironde scattering starlight and glowing infrared behind you.\"\"From up close you can see even better how the serpent's tail segments move together despite the five-meter gaps between them.\"\"Your band of adventurers regroups in the outer orbit of Outpost and confers about the best method for storming the planet.\"\"You plunge right in, narrowly avoiding a marshmallow, and soon find yourself floating serenely in the depths of a liquid that is both warm and supportive.\"\"A familiar sight appears as you shut down the hyperdrive. Yes, sirree, the same asteroid-satellite that blocked your path and shot you up before. It's still right where you left it, broadcasting its cacophonous message.\"\"Focused ever so intently, you prepare for the attack run. Your computer has already laid a course which will take you right over the power generator.\" (Uh...)\"You experience a rather painful eternity of the most extreme torment, as the monster slowly dismembers you and eats the pieces. Fortunately enough, this being a dream, you do eventually wake up. Unfortunately, you are still on Tretiak.\"Again, great stuff, but it's a book. I play CRPGs.****Update: 11 years later, I went back and finished the game.

Although I allow that it's CRPG \"enough,\" it's not my kind of game.I wasn't sure whether to progress to the second quest in the first group or the first quest in the second group. I tried the former and it proved rather difficult, so I theorized that within the three groups, the first quests are of uniform difficulty. This proved to be the case. In fact, the first quests of groups 2 and 3 were much easier than the first quest of group 1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 In \"The Master of the Dark Marsh,\" I was commissioned by a worried father to rescue his daughter from a dragon. The dragon, assuming the form of a human, had tricked the girl into eloping with him. When I found her, she had (for some reason) been transformed into a giant bullfrog.\u00a0 \u00a0 Next quest, we get Jack-and-the-Beanstalk. This game is quite a melange of themes.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Professing her love for the dragon, she was reluctant to accept my help, but I gradually gathered the ingredients to make a potion--incidentally slaying her fianc\u00e9 in the process--and ultimately convinced her to drink it. Her father rewarded me with a \"Coin of Joy\" that got me 200 experience when I gave it to the king.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \"The Garden of the Gods\" was a short series of fetch-and-carry missions for Greek Gods. The mortals below hired me to figure out why Zeus suddenly started tossing lightning bolts at them.An atheist is born.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I found Zeus in his throne room after bribing his guard with a bottle of wine, but he immediately tossed me back to the earth.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Some seeds I had found soon sprouted into a beanstalk, which I used to climb up and visit other gods. Hephaestus wanted a Seed of Flame from Apollo, who wanted to know what would win Aphrodite's heart. Dionysus had the answer (a red fruit) but wanted a bottle of wine for his trouble, which I got from Hephaestus. Finally, I had to recruit a young harp player (the game would only allow me three characters in this scenario just for this purpose) to play Aphrodite's harp for Zeus so he'd chill out. Calmer, Zeus told me he got angry because his priestess, Adana, stole a bracelet that granted her immortality.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adana looks a bit like Figment.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I defeated Adana, returned the bracelet to Zeus, and got the expected gold and experience for my efforts. The scenario only lasted about 20 minutes and was still a bit tiresome.Neither of these two scenarios put much emphasis on combat. Both had a couple of screens that swarmed me with creatures, but the odds of defeating all of them (some of them flew) seemed so remote, and the experience rewards so paltry, that I really didn't bother--I just ran past them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Whadda you got?\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 After the gods, I took a break to train my characters in various skills. Training takes a couple of years, so you don't want to do it very frequently, but I dispersed skill in item identification, monster identification, trap identification, and combat among them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wow. That's original.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My third quest of the day (my fourth total) was \"The Lost Talisman,\" in which a talisman with the power to control the weather had been stolen by an evil wizard named Destru. My \"monster identification\" skill immediately came in handy, since I otherwise would never have guessed that these creatures attacking me--who look the same size as me--are \"hill giants.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Talk like this.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 One of my characters (the elf) died fighting Destru, but the resurrection potion worked, and...you know what? I'm bored even writing this. Trust me, it's not worth playing except as a historical curio. Better games await you, and me.I read through a walkthrough by some chap styling himself dammit9x. The other quests seem largely more of the same--particularly fetching and carrying with large amounts of backtracking. Naturally, they get more difficult, and as your characters age, they run the risk of dying in their sleep. The walkthrough confirms my suspicion that there's no real \"end\" to the game. In fact, in the Japanese PC version, the number of scenarios eventually increased to 50. You'd have to really love the game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A quick GIMLET:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The game world is undistinguished fantasy fare. It combines so many themes from literature, mythology, and fairy tales, it really doesn't seem to know what it's about. Your actions have so little lasting effects that you can keep replaying the same scenarios (2). Character creation and development are limited, but there are interesting elements with the occupations and the skills. Managing the aging process adds a unique challenge to long-term players, and the skill system is mildly interesting. Fighters seem a bit overbalanced at the beginning (3). There are a number of NPCs, but your interaction consists of just listening to them and occasionally saying \"yes\" or \"no\" (2).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since I need you to finish the quest, I guess that's a \"yes.\" That's some serious role-playing.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The encounters are mostly lame, but I like that each level has a \"boss,\" and defeating him gets you a cool XP reward; no real role-playing opportunities that I could see, though. Though I usually like respawning, I don't like immediate, constant respawning (3). Magic and combat are extremely basic; you set your favored weapon or spell and then just hold down ENTER or SPACE to cast and attack; there are virtually no tactics, and you can just run away from most monsters (1).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trying to jump around and defeat these rock-tossing buzzards is more work than its worth.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 You are limited to a basic selection of equipment, but you do find one or two useful upgrades every quest (4), and the ability to enchant the items with spells adds a nice touch and ensures that the economy never grows stale; you can always use more money for upgrades and training (5). There is no main quest, but the game consists of 15 side-quests, all of which have a clear objective and several sub-side-quests. You can \"role-play\" these only to the extent that you can choose not to give the quest item to the king or the gods and instead keep it for yourself (4).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I didn't know where else to put this picture of me climbing a vine. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The graphics are very dated. I'm not usually much of a graphics guy, but I have to hold action CRPGs to a higher standard, as graphics are half the point. Sound is also very primitive. The controls are easy enough to grasp, although it's somewhat annoying that \"jump\" and \"use\" (to go through doors and talk to people) use the same control (2). Finally, the gameplay is very linear within the quests, with no role-playing opportunities or real replayability. The quests are, mercifully, quite quick (2).The final score of 28 seems about right. I liked it marginally more than Mission: Mainframe, but not enough to keep playing when there was no way to \"win.\" Incidentally, every time I rank something in my spreadsheet these days, I scan backwards and see Swords of Glass sitting there with its paltry 27. Swords of Glass feels like the girlfriend I dumped too soon over a misunderstanding. I should have given it more of a chance.Oh, well.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 On to Star Saga. Never played it, never heard of it, have no idea what to expect.\"In times beyond memory, people fought for their lives in a world where monsters and magicians held sway in places of power and mystery. In those days, heroic adventurers went forth on perilous journeys to prove their courage against their foes in battles to the death. They were called...SORCERIAN.\" (I'm not sure if that's a noun or adjective.)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 SorcerianJapanNihon Falcom (developer and publisher)Released in\u00a01987 for PC-88; 1988 for PC-98 and Sharp X1; 1990 for DOS and Sega Genesis; 1991 for MSX; 1992 for TurboGrafx CD\u00a0 \u00a0Date Started: 24 January 2011\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I have a confession to make that will probably turn off some of my readers: I hate Japanese animation. Hate it, hate it, hate it. This is nothing against the Japanese. It's not a racial thing. I have known and loved many Japanese people. I just wish they wouldn't try to draw stuff.It's not really even the totality of the animation that I hate; it's mostly just the faces, and hair. I'm talking about this:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These images make my physically ill. Why? I don't know why. It's not like they all look the same, but all of them are incontestably Japanese (in style, not in ethnicity). It's something to do with the eyes, noses, and chins--and definitely the hair. (Are there no short-haired men in Japan?) Maybe it's because anime characters never really look Japanese: they look like Caucasians drawn by people who don't spend much time around Caucasians. Maybe it's the odd agelessness of the characters, so that female figures you're supposed to be attracted to look uncannily like children. Maybe it's just the fact that no one actually looks like this, and yet there's an entire industry devoted to churning out these images. Whatever the cause, thankfully this paragraph is now long enough that the preceding image has been pushed off the top of the screen and I no longer have to look at it.The one in the lower right is from Sorcerian, so you can imagine that this game--along with scores of others--is going to be a bit of a problem for me right at the get-go. Thankfully, in this case the graphics quality is poor enough that I can't really see the anime influence except in the character portrait.All right. That's out of the way.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A Sorcerian mission. Those guys jumping on me are called \"ouks.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sorcerian is an odd offering: a PC game that looks like a console game. It is part of the Dragon Slayer series of games developed by Nihon Falcom for Japanese PCs (although some were ported to Nintendo, they are, despite their appearance, originally PC games). The series includes eight games, plus expansion packs, from 1984-1995, but Sorcerian is the only one to receive a DOS or (western) PC release. The original game was made in 1987, but the DOS port comes from 1990.Before anyone has fits at the screen shot above, I should mention that the game is inescapably a CRPG. It might be an \"action-RPG,\" but it has levels and character classes and inventories and experience, and all the other trappings of a CRPG. If I exclude this one, I have to exclude Diablo later. I will allow, however, that action CRPGs, which depend a lot on graphics and sound, don't age quite as well as regular CRPGs, which depend more on tactics and story. In this, Sorcerian shares much with the game I just abandoned after my six-hour minimum: The Seven Spirits of Ra. Both feature combat by mashing down the SPACE bar. In Sorcerian, doing so controls four characters at once, some of whom have swords and axes, some of whom have staves that shoot spells, but it's no less banal in its tactics.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Creativity\" was my watchword here.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 You begin by creating a party of up to four characters, male or female, of one of four classes: fighter, wizard, dwarf, and elf. (This is the second recent game to conflate races and classes; the other was Le M\u00e2itre des Ames.) You are assigned seven attributes: strength, protection, vitality, karma (basically charisma), intelligence, magic resistance, and dexterity, and you can allocate a pool of 3-5 bonus points to customize these attributes. Oddly, the attributes can be negative numbers; my dwarf above is so dumb he actually has a negative intelligence. All characters start at age 16, which would have been cool when I was 16 but seems kind of creepy now.Those are some steep, pointy mountains.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 After character creation, you take your characters to the town to purchase weapons, armor, and shields (fighters and dwarves) or staves, robes, and rings (elves and magicians). Other features of the town that you don't use until after your first mission are the magician (enchants items with spells), the herbalist (mixes reagents into potions; sells potions), the temple (resurrects the dead and allows you to build karma through confession and prayer), the elder's house (identifies magic items), the throne room (advances levels), and the training field (ups your attributes at the expense of years). The \"musician's guild\" exists, as far as I can tell, only to give you a sample of the different songs in the game, none of which I can get to play through my speakers.The first quest.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 After that, it's a simple matter of heading out on a quest. There are, from what I can tell, 15 different quests to play, organized in three \"scenarios.\" I don't think there's an ultimate \"main quest,\" and thus no way to \"win\" the game, although I suppose I'd call it winning if you complete all 15 adventures. Still, the lack of an ultimate goal frees me from what I consider any obligation to play through all 15. I'll play it until I get sick of it.I created a fighter (Fai-Tar), a dwarf (Da-War), an elf (Sil-Bani), and a wizard (Wii-Sar) and headed off into the first scenario. I've videoed a bit of it so you can see what it looks like to play:The quest involves finding the royal scepter from the ouks in a dank cavern. I led my party somewhat randomly through the doors until I found a wounded adventurer named Goran who had been on the same quest. He told me I would need two invisible crystals to drain a room of acid and, later, a jewel to put in the hands of a demon statue.The crystals, being invisible, were a bit of a pain to find, but Goran's clues helped. I then had to find a jewel in one demon statue and transfer it to a couple of others. It was a lot of trial-and-error and backtracking (lots of backtracking).Taking a jewel out of a demon statue's hands takes guts.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I had to contend with a variety of  creatures, escape traps, and solve a couple of light puzzles that  involved putting a blue stone from one place into another, and pouring  water from one jug into another. There was at least one hidden switch that made a door appear, and a couple of holes that didn't look like doors but actually were, and two hydra-looking things that gave a lot of experience points (alas, they, unlike the other creatures on the level, did not respawn) but didn't seem to be guarding anything more valuable than an herb.Hydras in the first quest are unexpected.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 By the time it was all over, I wasn't entirely sure what I had done, but I had the scepter, a new long sword, and some more herbs. A return visit to Goran's cave found him gone (or dead) but his axe left behind.When you return to town, you get the results of your quest, including items, gold, and experience......and much like Phantasie, you divide up the plunder among your party, or sell it.Once I had received my reward of experience and gold from the king, I returned to town and spent some of my loot. I found that the \"savory\" herb the hydras had been guarding created a resurrection potion, and I was able to create cure and heal potions out of other herbs I had picked up. The elder said that my long sword had a \"flame\" ability that he could release for 480 gold--way more than I have, so that will have to wait. Finally, I visited the throne room and each of my characters advanced one or two levels.A few additional notes, because I get the impression that y'all like bullet points:Each of your characters has an occupation that apparently he or she engages in when not adventuring. All of them start as farmers, but you can change them based on their levels and statistics. As far as I can tell, the only reason for the occupations is to give the characters annual incomes (years pass quickly in the game), and some of them are mildly amusing. If more were done with these occupations, it could make for an interesting role-playing element. I made my fighter a spy, my dwarf a translator, my elf a dancer, and my wizard an exorcist. I hope there's not a big call for that in the kingdom, though.By day, he is a mild-mannered \"cheese maker\"; by night he clears caves of ouks...You don't get experience for defeating enemies until you clear out an entire area of them. But even after this happens, they start appearing again almost immediately. I'm not sure there's any way to completely \"clear\" an area. In a couple of places on the opening scenario, I was swarmed by rats (yes, rats) that respawned so quickly I was never able to even momentarily clear them.Hit points and magic points regenerate constantly when standing still, and quite quickly, so combat is about the difficulty of individual battles rather than accumulated battles.Enchanting items apparently takes a long time. I had my wizard take his staff in for enchantment, and the magician told him to come back in three years. However, the first scenario took my characters two years to complete, so maybe it won't be so long in real time.\"Morning or afternoon?\" \"What difference does it make? It's three years!\" \"Well, the plumber is coming in the morning.\" Cold War humor. You had to be there.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That's the gist of it. I'll play one or two more scenarios and re-evaluate. I admit to a little impatience because there is some awesome stuff coming up in 1988: Might & Magic II, Pool of Radiance, Ultima V, the first game based on The Lord of the Rings...I'm even looking slightly forward to The Bard's Tale III. But I have to get out of 1987 first."}, {"title": "Game 41: The Seven Spirits of Ra (1987)", "date": "Monday, January 24, 2011", "text": "Not many games feature an Egyptian setting.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Seven Spirits of RaUnited StatesMacrocom (developer); Sir-Tech (publisher)Released in 1987 for DOSDate Started: 23 January 2011\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The Seven Spirits of Ra starts you, the Pharaoh Osiris, in the midst of an unwinnable battle against the minions of Set, the \"god of darkness.\" The game explains that Set \"envied the love the people held for their good king\" and used his priest, Harumheb, to somehow deceive Osiris's guards into killing him. (From the screen shot, it looks like it happens on a boat.) Harumheb then sliced up Osiris's body and scattered the pieces across the land, where they were devoured by birds and beasts.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Osiris, having been \"deprived of the rites of burial,\" is now a wandering \"ka spirit\" who must \"gain the attributes of the creatures who consumed his body\" in order to enter the Land of the Dead and \"emerge victorious in life beyond death.\" An unusual setup for sure.I haven't found a manual so far, so I'm just feeling my way through the game. Fortunately, hitting F1 brings up a help menu with the game's commands, including (d)rop, (e)nter, (p)ick up an item, (r)ead, (s)tatus display, (t)ransform, and (w)eapon select. Movement is with the numeric keypad.This has a very \"Atari-ish\" feel.I start off next to a pyramid, clad only in some kind of skirtish thing, under the blazing sun. Buzzards swoop in and attack, and my own attacks seem ineffective (perhaps because I do not yet have a weapon). Although my health seems to continually regenerate, one of them kills me, and one of seven little \"man\" icons at the bottom of the screen disappears. That's right: this is a CRPG in which you have \"lives.\"Near the pyramid is a strange symbol on the ground. When I stand upon it and \"read\" it, I am presented with some sort of odd hieroglyphic:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 This would appear to be Anubis next to a giant playing card depiciting a cheerleader creating a spirit tower out of a beetle holding up the sun. I guess I'd better save these screenshots in case they become important later.No matter how fanciful the setting, every CRPG has you fighting rats at the beginning.Sick of being bedeviled by buzzards, I escape into the Pyramid of Manu, \"where fire is kept, yet warmth is not.\" I am immediately assailed by rats and snakes, against whom my hand attacks prove effective. I am able to pick up their little skulls, but I don't know why. Soon, a couple of flickering ghosts (interesting graphics effect) come along and prove unaffected by my karate, so I must flee. I really need to find a weapon.Indiana Jones's personal hell.Another nearby pyramid features so many snakes and ghosts that I don't stand a chance. All of my little men are soon gone. The game tells me I have been taken to \"The Pits of Abot, where souls are cast forever into the lake of fire.\" Although apparently, \"there is no escape from this place,\" it allows me to keep playing, so I assumed there must be an escape somewhere. After exploring for a few minutes, though, I must conclude that no, there is in fact no way out of hell. I restart.Nice job with the lake of fire and demons, though.All right. Let's deal with the \"attack\" graphic right away. The quick video below shows a few seconds of gameplay, with me attacking some rats. I won't linger on what it seems to depict, but I will say that the developers could probably have chosen a better animation.I decided to try to explore the extent of the game map and found that it is 48 steps north-south and 127 steps east-west. The game can't quite figure out whether it's two- or three-dimensional,  so you have things shaped like pyramids, but laid down flat (I can't  walk behind them), and on the northern edge of the map, where I finally  see the sky, I'm blocked from moving further by--well, the sky, I guess.I'm having uncomfortable flashbacks to Frogger.In the far southwest corner, across a river of crocodiles, I finally  found a sword. It helped a lot with the buzzards and other assorted  nasties. I thought to clear the map of them, but they seem to respawn.  The game gives me points for every monster I slay as part of my overall  \"score\"; I don't know if this actually does anything for me.\u00a0 \u00a0 Even with the sword, combat is rather boring: I simply hold down the SPACE bar and wave my sword back and forth until my enemy dies, or until I run out of so much health that I have to retreat. Since you don't really seem to gain any benefit (other than the \"score\") for killing enemies, and since they respawn like mad, there seems little reason not just to hold down the space bar and run through them (they can't block you), killing them if you're lucky but not worrying about it if you aren't.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 There are three pyramids on this opening map: Manu, Hetsahpet,  and one that seems to have an entrance in the middle, so I don't know  how to reach it. The pyramids are full of snakes, mummies, ghosts, and  rats, and all of them respawn with exceeding swiftness. Fortunately,  there are occasional potions scattered about that fully heal me.Osiris in the City of TombsBattling through the Pyramid of Manu, I found myself in the City of Tombs, where I was assaulted by demons along with the previously-mentioned creatures. In one corner, I found a mass of rats. One of them was flashing, and when I killed him, I had the ability to transform myself into a rat. I guess I have 1/7 of my soul. This ability allowed me to creep down corridors that had previously been too small, and I found some other objects, including a staff (an alternate weapon that allows me to shoot fireballs, though it's tough to aim, and I hurt myself if they explode too close), something that looks like a statue of a cat, and several things that look like gold bricks.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Also in the City of Tombs, I ran into some guy that looks like Anubis. He has a riddle for me:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Children?\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I really hope this is a riddle, discoverable within the game, and not some kind of copy protection.The Seven Spirits of Ra was published by Sir-Tech (the creators of Wizardry) and developed by a company called Macrocom. To call it \"obscure\" would be an understatement. Neither the game nor the company has a Wikipedia entry, and it does not appear that there is a single \"Let's Play\" or walkthrough online (though in the past, my readers have been good about digging up things I haven't). MobyGames waxes on about the developer's graphic techniques, which apparently used some programming tricks to squeeze more color out of the CGA standard than should have been possible, but obviously it's hard to get excited about that now.MobyGames also has an interview with the developers, Rand Bohrer and Neal White III, who come across as cool guys but otherwise don't offer many clues as to the game. For such a limited game, it hardly seems like the lack of a game manual should be crippling, but given how often I get slaughtered, and my lack of ideas about how to use the various items I've found, I can't imagine I'm not missing something.In any event, I can't really see this as a CRPG. I have to stop accepting MobyGames's word for such things. Its predecessor, ICON: Quest for the Ring, seems to have identical gameplay but is not listed as a CRPG. Granted, I was recently very flexible about what constitutes a CRPG, but I have to draw the line at games that feature \"lives.\" There appears to be no attributes, character development, or leveling, and combat is all action-based. It is, at best, an \"adventure game.\"Still, there's some interesting stuff here, including the setting, the ability to transform into animals, and the existence of hell. Most games, when you die, just show you a screen or cut scene saying you're dead and giving you a chance to reload; The Seven Spirits of Ra drops you in an inescapable lake of fire. The interview suggests that the final battle plays out like the duel between Merlin and Madam Mim in The Sword in the Stone, with the foes transforming into various creatures that trump each other.I'll keep playing a while to see if I can figure my way through the game a little better--and I'd love to hear from anyone else who has played. Otherwise, don't be surprised if this is my one and only posting on the game. [Ed: It was, for a long time, and then I won it over 10 years later.]*****Further reading: Over 4 years later, I went and played Macrocom's first RPG: ICON: The Quest for the Ring (1984).

(You're getting it on the same day as my entry for Pirates! because I feel like I trespassed upon your tolerance enough with that game in a CRPG blog.) NetHack doesn't feel so much like a game that you finish and evaluate as one that becomes an ongoing part of your life. Although I played it for about 20 hours, I know I didn't discover even a fraction of what there was to find. Many of you have suggested that I read the spoilers for this version, but I'm having trouble separating v. 2.3e spoilers from later versions, and I've already discovered things I wish I hadn't. Some of what you think I might have missed are features introduced in later versions, like the \"explore\" option. Thus, if you're a player of the latest incarnations of NetHack, keep in mind that this version is somewhere between Rogue and what you've got.1. Game World. I can't rank this one too high, but no roguelike really goes over-the-top in its depiction of the world and your character's backstory. You are an adventurer seeking the Amulet of Yendor, and the multi-leveled dungeon lies before you. That's it. There's no real history or lore to the place. Score: 1.2. Character Creation and Development. Development is satisfying, swift, and tangible. As you slay monsters, you gain experience and automatically rise in levels. Scrolls, potions, and certain items increase your strength and armor class (but can just as quickly deplete them). Your choice of class really does make a difference, if only for difficulty reasons (the encounters seem to play out the same). There are no quest rewards that I could find. Score: 6.3. NPC Interaction. There aren't many NPCs in this version (at least that I could find): the occasional shopkeeper and such, but the interaction is very basic. There may be others at lower levels. I have to give it a low score pending news that I missed a large chunk of the game: 1. Roguelikes are never really about NPCs anyway.4. Encounters & Foes. Deceptively complex. Your various foes, featured as letters, don't seem like much of anything until they start attacking you. Eyes put you to sleep, killer bees sap your strength with their stings, leprechauns steal your gold and teleport away, quantum mechanics teleport you away, and nymphs seduce you for your equipment. You start to realize that every little letter requires a different approach from the moment that you first notice it. Although there aren't really \"role-playing\" opportunities here or scripted encounters, there is a lot of strategy involved, many of the encounters are random, and the enemies respawn. My, do they respawn. I usually regard this as a good thing, allowing you to bolster your experience if you so choose; in this game, it can be quite deadly. My visit to the mysterious vault, and the guard that showed up, hinted at a depth of other types of encounters that I didn't get a chance to experience in this version. Score: 6.I never really did figure out what this was about.5. Magic and Combat. I wasn't a huge fan of the magic system, which features learned spells in a spellbook that nonetheless fade away as you use them. Wouldn't the magic points have been enough? Combat, as I've said, can be fairly tactical depending on the type of creature. The problem is, you can't outrun anything, so while it's nice to think that you can tailor your tactics to the particular foe--missile weapons, magic items, and such--you almost always end up in melee combat even when you don't want to. I guess this is where teleportation comes in handy! I feel like I didn't get to explore a lot of combat options, though: does moving rocks around help with tactics? How can you best use your dog? That sort of thing. I'll try harder on this in later versions; for now, I'll give it a 5.6. Equipment. This is perhaps NetHack's strongest suit. You find an enormous variety of weapons, armor, potions, scrolls, and wands randomized throughout the dungeon, and all of them are unidentified when you discover them (unless you've had a magic item of the same type before). They are harmful as often as helpful, as anyone who has come across a Scroll of Disintegrate Armor or a Potion of Poison can attest. This adds an enormous amount of strategy to the game: when should I try to use an unidentified item, and when should I play it safe? Even better, some of the items have non-obvious uses, or work together in ways that I only started to identify: throw a bit of food at a wild dog, and he becomes your pet. Use another magic item while you're confused, and unexpected things occur. And none of this even gets in to the uses of corpses. I just wish food wasn't such a prominent feature of the game. I know it's all about the challenge, but I feel like the damned thing is challenging enough without always fighting starvation. Finally, the game takes perverse pleasure in identifying your unidentified equipment after you die. I'm going to give this the highest score I've given to a CRPG so far: 8.Some of these things might have been very useful.7. Economy. You occasionally run into stores, so unlike Rogue, you can actually buy stuff with your accumulated gold, which makes it all the more infuriating when a leprechaun comes along and steals it. But, gods, how I wish the shopkeepers would identify your stuff for a fee. Hell, their own items aren't even identified! You could pay 100 GP for a potion and have it kill you. Score: 4.Thankfully, this shopkeeper is selling food!8. Quests. The one main quest is to find the Amulet of Yendor, and I don't think there are any side-quests in this version, although I could be wrong. The main quest itself isn't all that compelling--like most roguelikes, it's just a MacGuffin. Score: 2.9. Graphics, Sound, & Inputs. The array of keyboard commands is dizzying at first; almost all letters are used, and lowercase and capitals do different things. But you get used to it surprisingly quickly, partly because they make intuitive sense, such as (w)ield and (s)earch. I didn't like how in the middle of combat, the game would suddenly decide that the messages were too long to fit on one screen, so I'd have to hit SPACE to continue the fight; outside of combat, SPACE means \"pass,\" and I would get into a rhythm by which I would hit it accidentally in the middle of combat, wasting a turn. That's about my only complaint. As for graphics and sound, complaining about them in a roguelike somewhat misses the point, but I will risk your disdain by saying that I wish they were a little more advanced. Score: 2.10. Gameplay. In a sense, NetHack is extremely linear, propelling you forward through layers of the dungeon. However, you do have a lot of flexibility as to how fast you descend and how much you want to risk starvation for the sake of extra experience on lower levels. The randomization of the dungeon and the strengths and weaknesses of each character class make it enormously replayable. Unfortunately, most of the time you're \"replaying\" at times you wish you weren't, such as just after your valkyrie gets transmogrified into a mimic on the 15th level. The game is enormously addicting at lower levels, but dying on a higher level really takes the wind out of your sails. Although I've heard reports that some  NetHack masters are able to ascend in almost every game, I find it fiercely challenging, which is at once part of its charm and utterly exasperating. In a regular CRPG, I might punish this type of difficulty, but it's not like you don't know what you're getting into when you fire up a roguelike. Score: 7.I will venture that this is the only game where this happens.The final score of 42 seems a  little low, although keep in mind that I didn't get to experience  everything, and I might have ranked it a few points higher if I did. I  hear that later versions have more NPCs, more complex dungeons, quests,  and such, and I expect a significantly higher ranking then.Even as I finish up this review, I wish I hadn't closed out the game. I should probably do something unique with NetHack and leave it continually open until I win, perhaps playing a little bit every day or every week, in between other games. I probably will do this with the next version (which I expect I'll get to around summertime), but continuing with this version when the next level offers so many innovations seems a little silly. The next time, I also plan to keep a much more careful log about what the different items, foes, and corpses do.I did briefly consider cheating (at least, just backing up my saved games) to win, just so I could report on what it was like. But this opens things up for all kinds of abuse later on, and I'm not very good with self-regulation unless I establish fixed, absolute rules. My use of a hex editor to cheat my way through Mission: Mainframe already puts me in dangerous waters. Plus, when I finally win NetHack--just like with Rogue--I want the satisfaction of beating it fair and square.****Edit from 11/29/2013: Almost three years later, after I ascended in NetHack version 3.0, I returned to this version, won it, and lowered the GIMLET slightly to 36. See that post for more!

Here's my GIMLET for the game:1. The boundin' Main. Pirates! is set in the real world, albeit a fanciful depiction of it. Its sheer size and its attention to historic detail are grand, but even better is the way that things happen irrespective of your actions. Nations go to war and declare peace, Indians attack settlements, and other pirates sack towns. But these events aren't just random, ex-post-facto occurrences. In one month, the treasure fleet is in Puerto Bello, the next in Cartegena, and in between, you can actually intercept it as it sails between them. If you hear about a pirate raid on Tortuga, you can reload, get to Tortuga sooner, and catch the pirates before they attack! Very few games feature a world in which events occur so dynamically. And your actions change the nature of the world: you can disrupt trade, affect prices, instigate wars, and convert cities. I can't think of many games that do it better. Score: 9.Catching the treasure f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 leet out of harbor.2. Gettin' yur sea legs. The lack of traditional CRPG-style character development is one of the reasons that Pirates! is only marginally a CRPG. You do not have attributes or gain levels or get experience for your quests and combats. In fact, the opposite occurs: you get older and sicker and slower, and you eventually have to decide whether it's worth extending your years of piracy. Although you can pick a nationality at the beginning of the game, it seems to have no bearing on anything except your starting town: you can advance in any nation's admiralty, and no one ever refers to you by your nation. The only real development is the advancement (at your own discretion) through the apprentice, journeyman, adventurer, and swashbuckler ranks, but the downsides to doing so (harder gameplay) generally outrank the benefits (a slightly higher share of the gold), although to be fair I played this last game fairly safe, keeping to the apprentice level for most of my career, and had few challenges. Score: 1.3. Jawin' wit' mateys. The \"NPCs\" in the game include the governors, tavernkeepers, other pirates, and governor's daughters. No matter their location or nationality, they always say the same things, and you always have the same limited options while talking to them. You learn very little about the game world from them. Probably a little more variety could have been put into this part of the game. Score: 3.The extent of NPC interaction.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4. Scallywags and scurvy dogs. The encounters in the game occur with various ships and other pirates. Unfortunately, they almost all play out exactly the same: you approach a ship and note the style, then \"investigate\" to see the nationality. At that point, you have the option to close for battle, hail for news, or sail away. You generally attack ships of the nation you're against and/or pirates and hail or sail away from the others. The encounters don't play any differently with different nationalities, although other pirates are slightly less likely to let you sail away or hail them. There are nonetheless roleplaying options in these limited choices, as you saw yesterday with my sudden decision to make enemies of the Dutch or my early decision to make a living as a pirate hunter. Still, some variety would have been nicer. No dedicated captain ever scuttles his ship to keep an enemy from capturing it, and no one ever shows up and attacks you. Score: 4.5. Swasshbucklin' and hoodoo. No magic in this game, of course. There are three types of combat: ship-to-ship battles, land combat, and swordplay. All of them depend partly on probabilities (e.g., your age and level, and whether you chose \"skill at gunnery\" or \"skill at fencing\" in the opening), but mostly on your own aim, timing, and reactions. None of them are terribly hard. In my entire game, I never lost a ship-to-ship battle or sword fight (although I came very close to the latter once or twice) until the very end. Land combat is the most intriguing of the group, as it involves tactics such as choosing the right terrain, dispersing your parties, and flanking the enemy. I've never done it often enough--not even when I was younger--to get really good at it, although I suppose you could have a career in which you engaged in land combat continually, trying to capture towns for your favored nation. Ship-to-ship combat can be fairly tactical, especially when you're trying to do something crazy like taking on a war galleon with a pinnace. Ultimately, however, all combats get repetitive and boring towards the end of the game. Score: 5.I feel like there's more to it than I fully explored.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6. Me Effects. Another element that probably disqualifies Pirates! as a CRPG is the lack of any equipment. It would have been cool if you could have used some of your booty to buy better swords, ship upgrades, maybe some light armor, and so on (although since Sid Meier wasn't trying to make a CRPG, I can see why these options aren't present). Score: 0.7. Swag. The economy plays a vital role in the game. You can actually affect the prosperity of a city--and, consequently, the trade value of goods--in the way that you buy and sell. Some people play Pirates! as traders, doing not much more than buying and selling; this seems exceedingly boring to me, but there are a lot of logistics that go into it. You have to watch the news carefully for signs of new gold mines, Indian attacks, and plagues, and you have to record the prices you get for goods at various towns. I basically just sold based on convenience, which is probably why I ended up as a \"rather wealthy man\" instead of an extremely wealthy one. Although there's no equipment to buy with your booty, you do need it for treasure maps, intelligence about cities, letters of marque, and ship repairs. Your total gold also determines your crew morale, along with the length of the voyage and the number of crewmembers, adding a bit of fun strategy. Finally, gold never stops being important, since it affects your final score. I guess I just wish there was more stuff to buy. Score: 7.Fairly middling prices on everything. A smart captain wouldn't sell here.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8. Goin' on account. There is no one \"quest\" in the game--another sign of non-CRPGness--but you do have a lot of options for self-imposed quests, such as rising the ranks of various nations, rescuing all your family members, getting married, sacking a particular town, capturing the treasure fleet or silver train, and achieving a certain total in gold or land. Your ultimate \"quest,\" I guess, is to get as high a score as possible in the final tallying, although some players might prefer individual achievements--like four dukedoms--to any overarching score. The governors also give you some minor quests, such as delivering letters or capturing pirates. Score: 6.9. Graphics, Sound, and Inputs (aye, there be no pirate talk for these). The graphics in the DOS version are tolerable, but the sound really is not, and I played most of it with the speakers off. The game has an annoying tendency to make you wait until its little victory tunes finish playing before you can see the results of your ship captures and such. I wish the controls had involved less arrow-scrolling through options and more ability to choose by letter, but generally they were fairly intuitive. Score: 4.10. Yo-ho-ho. The gameplay is really the best element of Pirates! It is completely non-linear, allowing you to do whatever you want whenever you want. Much of the fun in the game comes from strategizing next actions, since time is so precious. Do I waste four months finding the buried treasure near Villa Hermosa, or do I wait until I have some other business there? Should I travel from Gibraltar to Havana via Santa Catalina, where someone has intelligence about my missing mother, but knowing that I will likely have no other significant encounters? Or should I travel up the Lesser Antilles, knowing it will maximize my chances of finding my enemies' ships? Do I trade in the heavily-defended San Juan, knowing the fort might fire on me, or do I head for the undefended but poor Trinidad? As we covered in the first posting, Pirates! allows for considerable role-playing, and in that role-playing comes enormous replayability. Once you master certain aspects of the gameplay, the challenge suffers a bit, but you can always ratchet that up by giving yourself a promotion. As you might guess from the frequency of my postings about the game this weekend, it is enormously addictive. For all of these reasons, I give the game my highest score in this category so far: 9.The final score of 48 seems awfully low given how much I enjoyed the game, but of course I'm ranking it as a CRPG rather than a strategy game or simulator. For its real category, I would invent another kind of GIMLET scale.The game was actually marketed as Sid Meier's Pirates! Like Richard Garriott, Meier is one of the few names that you know if you know games. He would later go on to create the Civilization series, which I sheepishly admit I've never played and am unlikely to play as part of this blog. But I will be dipping into other MicroProse titles with Darklands (1992), BloodNet (1993), and Master of Magic (1994).Having finished this game, I have a few questions for other Pirates! players:Has anyone ever sailed all the way up to Bermuda, or walked across Honduras to Gran Granada? If so, why?Has anyone played an entire game after failing the copy protect question at the beginning? How did it go?Is the 2004 version basically just the same game with better graphics and sound, or does it add a lot of new material?Although I probably tested the patience of CRPG purists with these postings, I added Pirates! Gold and the 2004 re-release to my list, maybe just for one posting, to see what's changed. I look absurdly forward to finding out."}, {"title": "Pirates! The Career of Captain Gatomalo, Part 2", "date": "Saturday, January 22, 2011", "text": "I have recruited a spy in the court of Santiago.August 1662: I resume my career after several months of vacation. A small crew of 25 men has heard my call and returned to Santiago to sign up with my barque, but I soon pick up 63 more in the tavern. Unfortunately, Spain still remains at peace with all of the surrounding nations, and Spain and England remain firmly in alliance. England and Holland are still at war, but I care not about their squabble. I have a treasure map for Panama, and news of my father awaits in Trinidad. My plan is to sail south from Santiago to Panama, collect the treasure, and then sail along the coast of South America to Trinidad. I will capture and plunder pirates as I find them and remain hopeful that Spain will soon be at war with someone.December 1662: The Panama treasure--11,000 gold pieces--is in my hold, and my crew is happy. In Cartagena, I turn in two more pirates and am promoted to a Spanish Colonel, but the snotty merchants refuse to trade with me because I'm a \"pirate.\" A difficult fight with Baron D'Valdez guts my crew so much I am unable to even spare a prize crew for his ship. I put in to Maracaibo for reinforcements and manage to seduce another governor's daughter to be my spy. I also buy a treasure map that depicts another location in the Bahamas.January 1663: I've traveled to Trinidad for nothing. Count Oropesa left months ago for Cumana. I turn back west.Aren't \"skilled\" and \"able\" the same thing?February 1663: I find and defeat Oropesa in Cumana. The map he gives me to the plantation on which my father is being held is maddeningly unspecific; it could be any island in the Spanish Main. I need another piece. I resolve to sail north along the Lesser Antilles and ultimately to the Bahamas to get the treasure. I hope to get enough pirates along the way to earn favor with a governor and get more news of my father.April 1663: France is at war with England. Great.June 1663: I stumble upon the location of my father, in the Bahamas, just after finding buried treasure there. What serendipity! And, like my sister, my father has somehow come across a map to an incredible treasure. Its location is harder to determine than the last. It seems to be next to a lake on the north coast of somewhere--could be Cuba, Hispanola, South America, or Central America. The only way to tell is to sail the coasts. I have nothing else to do, and the haul last time was definitely worth it.August 1663: The governor of Havana makes me an Admiral. How come only the Spanish care about captured pirates? I find out that the Marquis Porreno in Caracas knows about my lost mother. It'll be a while before I make it there.\"Well, back to the Spanish Main! I'll be back in two years or so.\"October 1663: Months of fruitless sailing along the Mexican and Central American coastlines puts me back in Puerto Bello, the town I started in. I visit the governor and find that his daughter is a ravishing beauty. Impetuously, I propose marriage and she agrees! After a duel with her jealous suitor, my lovely black-haired beauty and I are wed. How can I fight the Spanish if I'm married to one of them? What have I done?Take that, Pizarro!December 1663: Off the coast of South America, just southwest of Caracas, I find the Inca treasure. Another 100,000 gold pieces are mine. In Caracas, things get busy. I defeat Marquis Porreno and get a map to my lost mother--another mysterious island. The governor gives me a mission to capture the pirate \"Pegleg\" off the coast of Cartagena. Meanwhile, I turn in two more pirates to him, and he's so giddy that he makes me a Baron! I am now both married and landed nobility among my enemies, and all because no nation dare engage them in war. The absurdity makes me scream.January 1664: You know what? Sod the Dutch. They have every reason to hate the Spanish, and yet they pussyfoot around their natural enemies and make war on the English instead. They will pay for their cowardice, and I will get rewards from England for their suffering. I capture a Dutch sloop on my way past Curacao. When I return, I will sack this miserable town.March 1664: I capture Pegleg off Cartagena and make my way back to Curacao, collecting men and ships on the way. Curacao has 270 soliders, and I need to be equal to the task of invading the city. My crew is unhappy with the increased staffing and their reduced shares, although they will see the rate climb soon enough.April 1664: In the waters off Curacao, I capture a few Dutch ships to increase my cargo capacity. Then it's time to strike! Opting for a land battle, I approach the city from the north. As expected, the garrison marches out to meet me. After some volleys with their ships and battalions, my men scale the fort's walls. When my duel with the fort's commander begins, we are nearly matched in men, but he is no match for my blade. Within a minute, he has surrendered, and the city is mine. Maybe now that they have been sacked by a Spanish Baron, they will see the error of their ways.Unfortunately, my quick victory means that I am left with a large, unhappy crew. I admit I'm not as quick to win the next few battles as I could be. Soon the contingent is smaller and pleased again.June 1664: My expectations of rewards from the English were well-founded. I am made an Ensign and given 300 acres of land in Barbados. Unfortunately, my crew is unhappy again. I am forced to divide up the plunder. The crew is pleased with their portions.Plundering St. Martin.1665: My third expedition. My ploy against Curacao worked, and Spain is now at war with Holland. Actually, everyone is at war with Holland, the poor bastards. Unfortunately, the Dutch want nothing to do with me, so the war avails me not, and Spain remains a firm ally of my new patrons, the English. I sack both St. Martin and St. Eustatius in sea battles. My continuing piracy against Holland--which feels like shooting fish in a barrel--coupled with my pirate hunting has made me a Spanish Duke, an English Admiral, and a French Colonel.1666: I turn 31 this year, and my health is starting to fail. It is \"fair\" for now, but who knows how many more wounds I can take? Sword fights are getting harder. I realize now that I will never have vengeance on Spain. I have become Spain. A future in Puerto Bello with my lovely wife, titles, gold, and land is starting to sound attractive.After several years of searching, I finally had enough map pieces to find my mother. I discover her on a plantation north of Tortuga. Like my sister and father before her, she has a map to lost Inca treasure, but it depicts a location so generic--on the easternmost point of any number of islands--that at first I despair of ever finding it. But suddenly I spot the location on Jamaica near Port Royale. A third treasure of 100,000 gold is mine! My crew is getting ornery despite the gold, and so I divide up the plunder and give myself a promotion to journeyman.November 1666: Treachery! I attempt to put into port at Santiago to sell some captured pirate vessels when the traitors fire on me! A Spanish duke! Resolved to sneak into town and have words with the governor, I am spotted by a town guard, who engages me in a duel. I beat him, of course, but I am forced to flee like a coward. All my hatred for the Spanish resurfaces. I may have to live among them, but I will humiliate them before I retire.December 1, 1666: I successfully sneak into Santiago and meet with the governor's daughter, my spy. She tells me that the treasure fleet is in Puerto Bello. If it follows its usual pattern, it will leave soon for Cartagena, then far to the northeast to Campeche. I should be able to intercept the fleet before Campeche, or between Campeche and Havana. I begin collecting crew and ships.January 6, 1667: I arrive in Campeche to find the treasure fleet in town! A dilemma awaits me. There are 250 soldiers in town; my party consists of 224. Do I sack the town and take the entire fleet, or do I wait until it leaves and pick off the galleons one-by-one with my superior seamanship?The land battle is a disaster. I forget to account for the extra soldiers supplied by the treasure fleet itself. By the time my men reach the walls, I have only 99 crew against a garrison of 355. My swordmanship skills are strong, but they avail me not. I am wounded, captured and imprisoned. Damn my rashness! Damn the Spanish!December 19, 1667: Released from prison after a year, I limp my way back to Puerto Bello and my wife, and I retire from this insane life of politics and slaughter. My fortune is thus:I achieved the title of Spanish Duke, English Admiral, and French Admiral, making me an extremely important member of my community.I accumulated the sum of 41,220 gold pieces and 2,150 acres of land during my career, making me a rather wealthy man.My exploits on the high seas leave me with a reputation as a \"quiet and cautious captain.\" (Huh?)I retired from privateering at age 32. My bride is a lovely and cheerful girl. I succeeded in rescuing 3 members of my family. I was wounded 1 time in the course of my career. I become a contented and cheerful man.My pirating days are at an end. As a result of my seafaring exploits, I become a merchant captain, with 50/100 pirate points.Ah, but I can fantasize about a life in which I did not give in to my hatred--in which I retired before brashly attacking Campeche and the treasure fleet. In such a life, my reputation is of a \"competent and active\" captain, I become a \"cheerful and happy\" man, and I wile away my days as a sugar planter. So, yeah, it didn't turn out so bad the way it was.Avast! Tomorrow I shall pour myself a GIMLET and reflect more on the merits of my pirating days, as well as a career I had 'afore pirating, exploring dank caverns in search of treasure.Gatomalo after two years at sea.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Note: If you are uninterested in an absurdly long and detailed description of the gameplay in Pirates!, best to skip this entry. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 April 10, 1660: I escape from prison, sign up with some ne'er-do-wells in a tavern, and with absurd swiftness, become captain of a pinnace and 64 crewmembers. I find myself in the city of Puerto Bello (in modern day Panama) with a hold full of food and a heart full of revenge. The tavernkeeper tells me that Spain is at war with France, but the nearest French town is way up in Tortuga, so I'd better hold off on plundering Spanish ships until I'm closer to a friendly port. My current plan is to sail north to Port Royale and see if there's anything the English want before heading to Tortuga. I'll fight and capture any pirates along the way and attack the first Spanish ship I see within seven days' of Jamaica. Such a long trip is dangerous in the early days of an expedition, but I have to get out of Spanish waters.On second thought, no reason not to start right now.April 16, 1660: Only 6 days out of Puerto Bello, I encounter a Spanish barque. Although I'm still deep within Spanish waters, the idea of capturing such a useful ship is too much to resist, and I take it with only three shots fired. There are only 14 crewmembers (reduced from 20 by my cannons) on board, and they surrender the moment I approach. 500 gold pieces and several tons of sugar and tobacco, plus 4 cannons. Not a bad haul for my first plunder.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"A treasure chest in the hold is worth two in the ground\" -- old pirate saying.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 April 29, 1660: My memory of the Caribbean maps I saw as a child are flawless. Port Royale arrives on the horizon with barely a need to tack. As I approach the port, a pinnace sidles up along side me, his flag betraying him as the notorious Marquis Roberts. Although wary about engaging a skilled pirate, I know that if I can capture Roberts, the English governor will reward me. Navigating into his stern waters, I tack back and forth just aft of him, making sure he can never fully swing around to fire his cannons while I hit him with an occasional broadside. When he loses a mast, I approach and he immediately surrenders. Although he offers information about the Spanish treasure fleet and silver train, I feel he's more valuable as a hostage, and I stick him in my hold. His ship yields 1,370 gold and a few tons of food and goods. Two of his sailors join my crew.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My reputation grows.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 April 30, 1660: Arriving at Port Royale and not sure how the defense force will feel about a fleet of three pirate ships in its harbor, I choose to sneak into town. I visit the governor and pay 800 gold pieces for an English letter of marque--they're not at war with anyone now, but who knows what the future will bring. With this credential, I return to my ships and sail back into the port, able to conduct my business in the open. In the tavern, I pick up 20 more crew members. At the merchant's, I sell the damaged pinnace and my accumulated goods. As I leave the town, I realize that the governor didn't seem interested in my pirate hostage--probably because he was so busy with my letter of marque. I turn northeast to Tortuga, fighting headwinds.June 6, 1660: I encounter a French pinnace and get some news, and shortly after I encounter another French pinnace flying the flag of Baron de Lavale, a well-known pirate. I try to engage him but he raises full sails and flees before I can hit him with a single volley. Coward.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 June 13, 1660: Marquis Roberts gets a companion in my brig as I capture the sloop of Baron D'Clarion in a long ship and hand-to-hand combat. As our ships clash, I have about 10 more crewmembers than he does, so I take the conservative approach with a longsword.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 June 15, 1660: Tortuga at last. I ransom Roberts for more than 10,000 gold pieces, which makes my crew very happy. The French governor makes me pay 1,000 gold pieces for a letter of marque.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 July 8, 1660: In Port-de-Paix, the governor gives me a mission to take a letter to his brother, a spy in the Spanish-controlled town of Santiago. I accept it gladly, as it isn't very far away. I arrive in the city on July 19 and meet the spy in a tavern. Just for fun, I decide to visit the governor and I am appalled when he insists on taking Baron Alvado off my hands, noting that \"the king will be very pleased at this news.\" I wasn't trying to please the Spanish! Now, suddenly I have a letter of marque from my enemies! (This means I have a letter of marque from everyone but the Dutch now.) On the way out of town, I capture another Spanish pirate, Captain Vergard, and his sloop. I resolve to keep this one for ransom or turn him over to a government I want to befriend.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 August 12, 1660: Back in Port-de-Paix after capturing two more pirates. I got into this to kill Spanish, not capture pirates! But my hold is full of gold and my crew is ecstatic. The governor, pleased with my completion of his mission, promotes me to Ensign and awards me 150 acres of land. More important, he tells me that the evil Spaniard Admiral Porreno knows where my sister is! He was last seen in Campeche, a couple of months to the west, on the Yucatan Peninsula, deep in Spanish territory. Hmmm, perhaps it's not a bad thing that the Spanish are relatively pleased with me. The governor also introduces me to his lovely, red-haired daughter, but as I am just an ensign and she is being courted by an admiral, I make only light conversation. In the tavern, I pick up a couple dozen more pirates, sell off all but one sloop and one barque, and head out. My plan is to stop in Port Royale before making my way west to Campeche.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A good place to be.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 September 6, 1660: In Port Royale, a mysterious figure sells me a treasure map for 500 gold pieces. It depicts a fairly obvious place on the north side of Cuba. I briefly consider going there before Campeche but ultimately decide against it. The treasure will be there later; Porreno may not be.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 October 1, 1660: I arrive in Campeche after an utterly uneventful journey in which I do not encounter a single ship. I defeat Porreno in single combat, after which he tells me my sister is being held captive on a \"remote plantation\" and hands me a map with several pieces missing. The map seems to depict an archipelago with many reefs around it. I suspect it is in the Bahamas.Meanwhile, the Spanish governor takes one of my pirates off my hands and promotes me to Ensign! This wasn't supposed to happen! I hate the Spanish!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ijos de perros!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I determine my next course of action: head to the Bahamas via the Florida Keys and search these islands for a match, plundering Spanish ships on the way. If I can't find my sister, I'll pick up the treasure on Cuba and return to Port-de-Paix to get my reward for my privateering. I'll teach them to make me an officer in their fleet.October 4, 1660: I get the news from a Dutch trader that England is at war with Holland. Do I care enough about either country to try to gain favor by attacking the other? In other news, I hate sailing east; the trade winds are always against me.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 October 12, 1660: Off the Florida Keys, I take a Spanish barque, then a merchantman. Lots of gold and goods in the latter. That's more like it.December 1660: My attempt to find my sister in the Bahamas fails, so I return to Tortuga. There, the governor gives me a mission to find the pirate \"One-Eye\" off the coast of Barbados, way over in the lesser Antilles. At first I balk at this, but then I realize that there are many nations represented in the island chain, increasing my ability to plunder and get rewarded for it. Also, I need to stop at Santo Domingo on the way (on the south of Hispanola), where I have some intelligence that Duke Ramirez has some more information about my lost sister.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the heck is this?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 January 1661: I sneak in to Santo Domingo. My battle with Ramirez lasts nearly 10 minutes, with a couple of tight moments, before I finally get the upper hand and defeat him. From him, I get another piece of the map, but it leaves me scarcely better than before. Off to the Lesser Antilles, capturing two Spanish barques near Puerto Rico.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 March 1661: The Lesser Antilles come into sight, with all of their towns of various nationalities. In St. Martin, I buy a Dutch letter of marque; no telling how soon they might go to war with the Spanish. Off St. Eustatius, I capture a Spanish merchantman. In English St. Kitts, I make a killing on my cargo hold full of sugar, which is selling for 100 pieces of gold per ton. In French Guadelope, the governor promotes me to Captain for my deeds against the Spanish and tells me that Count Sanchez, in Havana, can tell me more about my sister.May 1661: Off the coast of Barbados, I capture One-Eye in a battle that, along with the subsequent visit to Barbados, I recorded for posterity. Why the governor of a French colony 500 miles away should care what's going on in Barbados, I have no idea. I resolve to head south to the Spanish-controlled waters around Trinidad, plunder some more ships, and stop by Martinique for another promotion (if I earn it), and then return to Tortuga. I have business on the island of Cuba: hidden treasure and Count Sanchez.June 1661: Arriving at Trinidad without having found any ships, I discover that the settlement has no fort and only a tiny garrison. In another moment recorded for the future, my crew assails the garrison, and I soon bring the commander to his knees and my crew sacks the town. The resulting treasure isn't much--my cargo hold won't accommodate much--but it's a nice moral victory. In Martinique, I get promoted to Major and get 250 acres of land.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 October 1661: I find the treasure on Cuba. Then, the unthinkable: a French pinnace informs me that France and Spain have made peace. No one is at war with Spain! How will I make my fortune? Fighting English or Dutch? I have nothing against them!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Looks like a match!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 November 1661: In Havana, I get another piece of the map and become more convinced than ever that it is in the Bahamas. After some searching, sure enough, I find it just a few days east of the Florida keys. I don't know how I missed it before. Unfortunately, in my haste to reach it, I sail over a reef and lose my barque. It doesn't matter: I found my sister! And more important, she has a map to a lost Inca treasure! Looking at it, it seems to me the most likely locations are south of Puerto Principe on Cuba or in the crook of Hispanola south of Port-de-Paix.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 February 1662: It was on Cuba. 100,000 gold piece are mine!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Always leave your crew HAPPY!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I write this last entry from Santiago, where I have divided up the plunder and released my crew after two years at sea. I will enjoy the next few months with my sister, hoping for a reversal of fortune on the diplomatic front: Spain and England have become allies. I can now not risk attacking Spanish ships without making enemies of the English.Spain, meanwhile, has not only given me amnesty for my past deeds, they were so delighted at the number of pirates I've captured that they promoted me to Major! My blood boils, but with no enemies and the English alliance, my vengeance against Spain will have to wait. In the meantime, I'll gladly take their land and titles and use them to my advantage--against them.On better news, I have heard of my long lost father! A Captain Oropesa in Trinidad knows something about his location. I also have a treasure map for a location near Panama. My exploits have made me famous, and I remain in fine health.

I had just finished my freshman year at college and I was applying for an internship (my college had a strong co-op program) at an office building in downtown Boston. It was the first time I had ever interviewed for a job (all my high school jobs had come about through the influence of family or friends), and I was absolutely terrified. Paranoid about being late, I had arrived at the building about 45 minutes early, and as I sat there in my uncomfortable shirt and mismatched tie, I thought seriously about just getting up, taking the bus home, and going to bed.Instead, I pulled a notepad from my backpack and wrote one sentence to myself: \"No matter what happens, in an hour you will get to go home with a bag of Doritos and a six-pack of Coke and spend the rest of the day playing Pirates!\"It helped. My nerves calmed and confidence bolstered, I went in to the office and gave the worst interview that any student has ever given. Not only did I not get the job, I'm pretty sure I was blackballed from the entire industry. But true to my word, an hour later I was playing Pirates! on my Mac, and I doubt I stopped all weekend. There was a time when I was addicted to this game far worse than any CRPG. I'd probably still be playing it now, full-time, except that once I had achieved the highest retirement rank in all six time periods, I decided that there wasn't much more I could accomplish with it. I had \"won,\" so to speak. I probably played my last game in 1993 or 1994 and haven't thought seriously about it until I saw that it was on MobyGames's list of CRPGs [Ed. It has since been removed.]Is this in any way justifiable? Probably not. In one of my earliest postings, I asked \"What is a CRPG?\" and came up with 10 criteria by combining a Wikipedia article with my own thoughts:Character identificationCharacter developmentFreedom of movement and choice of actionsQuestsAt least a partial focus on combatCombat at least partly based on probabilities rather than actionWeapons, armor, and items to buy, find, and equipGame progression through combat and dialogInteraction with NPCsRandom encountersNot every CRPG features every criteria on this list. Wizardry has no NPC interaction to speak of, and there are no quests in Telengard. But let's say a CRPG has to have at least 7 or 8 out of 10. Well, Pirates! gets 1, 3, 4, 5, and 10. The others are a stretch. MobyGames's other category, \"Strategy,\" defines the game better.And yet, ironically, damned if you don't role-play the hell out of this game. When you start, you choose your era and nationality, and depending on your choices, the game gives you a quick backstory: your family was robbed and imprisoned by a corrupt judge and you've just escaped from prison, or you're an adventurer being financed by the king, or you're a peasant farmer who chooses to sign up with some pirates to escape the  monotony of the fields. It hardly matters, as the rest of the gameplay is identical, and you have \"long lost\" family members to rescue no matter what.All of these would be good names for cocktails.Among other role-playing scenarios in Pirates! are the options to:Eschew any real \"pirating\" and instead serve each nation as a \"pirate-hunter,\" chasing down pirates and turning them in to the governors for rewards of title and land (and perhaps a comely daughter).Go privateer. Pick a side and wage war against the ships and towns of your nation's enemies, perhaps even driving out the governors and claiming towns in the name of your flag.Trade. Keep track of the buying and selling prices for different goods in each port, watch the news carefully for signs of prosperity (new gold mine) and calamity (Indian attack, plague) and use this information to make your fortune.Focus on recovering your long lost family members.Become an honest-to-god bloodthirsty pirate, attacking every ship you come across, avoiding all nations, pillaging the silver train and treasure fleet, slinking into dodgy, undefended ports to trade and pick up crewmembers, searching for lost treasure, and otherwise making as much money as you can.Of course, combinations are also possible. Every game is a new map of your life course. Do you want to start as a pirate but then see the error of your ways, settle down with a wife, and then do missions for your governor/father-in-law? Do you want to make a lot of money fast and retire young? There are a lot of possibilities, and they're all fun. The lesson is that not every CRPG really features \"role playing,\" and not every game that has a strong \"role-playing\" focus is a CRPG.I'm not the only Pirates! lover, of course. As Wikipedia chronicles, the game won numerous awards in the 1980s and was one of Computer Gaming World's top 20 games of all time in 1996. It spawned two remakes: Pirates! Gold in 1994 and Sid Meier's Pirates! in 2004.For those completely unfamiliar with the game, it is set in a vast area of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, bordered on the east by the Lesser Antilles and the west by the interior of Mexico. It goes as far north as the South Carolina coast and on the south deep into Venezuela and Colombia. I suppose this is easier with a map:Roughly this.The attention to historical detail is fantastic. If you visit Jamaica in 1560, you'll find the capital at Santigo Vega, since Spain occupied the island until 1655. This is particularly notable because the town was officially called Santiago de la Vega (almost all encyclopedias have it as this) but colloquially it had been shortened to Santigo Vega, a fact that the researchers of Pirates! somehow dug up. Anyway, return in 1660, and you'll find it in the hands of the English, with Port Royale as its capital. (The town was destroyed in 1692 and was replaced as the capital by Kingston, a fact that I learned with horror on my first trip to Jamaica.) The developers even researched the populations and economies of the various cities.A city ripe for invasion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through this bounding main you sail a fleet of ships, and no less detail is given to the style of ships you can engage and capture: English merchantmen, French pinnaces, Dutch cargo fluyts, and Spanish war galleons among them. You command a crew of rowdy pirates numbering from a handful to several hundred, plundering ships and towns, trading goods, finding treasures, and romancing governors' daughters.Gameplay consists of five main features:Navigation. As you sail from town to town, time passes. To maximize your useful life, you have to take the shortest routes possible, contend with wind and weather, avoid shoals, and keep track of your coordinates. The original version of the game, unlike Pirates! Gold and later versions, is realistic in its depictions of navigation. While your navigator's sextant can fix your latitude, he can only guess at your longitude based on the position of the sun. And you don't want to check too often, because taking coordinates burns an entire day. You have to be careful not to get stuck in an unpopulated area with no food, or with a discontented crew, who might suddenly mutiny.Ship-to-Ship Combat. When you choose to engage in combat with a pirate, enemy ship, or hapless victim, you enter a tactical combat screen in which you sail around the other ship, firing your cannons and simultaneously trying to avoid his. Your crew reloads at a speed based on their current morale, so it pays to keep them happy. You have to set the appropriate sails (battle sails for damage reduction or full sails for maximum navigability), carefully monitor your damage, and make sure that you don't riddle your enemy so full of holes that the ship sinks, taking useful cargo and hostages with it. The game uses a variety of this combat system to attack a town from the sea; you fire not on another ship but on the town's forts.Fencing. If the enemy doesn't surrender in ship-to-ship combat, you enter a fencing minigame in which choose a weapon and you and your foe swipe and lunge at each other until one surrenders. The point of surrender depends not only on how well you fence, but also on how many crewmembers you have relative to each other. If you have 60 pirates and you've reduced his crew to 6, he might fall on his knees after one thrust. If your crews are evently matched, it might take a good 10 minutes of thrusts and parries before one of you wins. You not only fence when capturing ships, but also when trying to extract information about a family member, fighting a rival lover for the governor's daughter's affections, or getting caught sneaking into town.Four hits later, he surrenders.Diplomacy and Trade. When you enter a town, you have a number of tasks to accomplish, including schmoozing the governor for a quest or promotion; recruiting new pirates at the tavern; seeking treasure maps and intelligence; repairing ships; and trading goods and cannons with merchants. You can only save inside towns, so visiting frequently is important. Sometimes towns are hostile to pirates--or to you in particular, if you've been pillaging that nationality's ships--so you have to sneak in. This limits your available options.Sugar is so cheap here, I could make a nice profit buying it and selling it in Havana.Land Combat. If you feel like attacking a town an alternate way, you can anchor your ships along the coast and have your band approach the town on foot. If they have a lot of soldiers, they may send battalions out to meet you; otherwise, you can storm the walls and attack the town's commander in one-on-one combat. Sacking a town results in the plunder of its valuables (if the residents haven't hidden them), and occasionally the governor flees, allowing you to install a new one of a more friendly nationality.Oh, but really, this only scratches the surface. The key to Pirates! is how well you plan, organize, manage, and strategize. Among the many elements you have to consider are:Keeping the men happy. Your crew's morale is dependent on how long you've been at sea, how much gold they see in the hold, and how many fellow crewmembers they have to split it with. A disgruntled crew performs badly in combat and might eventually rebel, so you have to watch it carefully, and every once in a while you have to divide up the plunder, sell all but one ship, and mount a new expedition. Since this process takes about four months of game time, you want to prolong it as long as possible, but not so long that your crew mutinies. You also want to keep a large crew for fighting towns and such, but not so large that they perceive a small share of the gold.After a month of sailing, my crew has only 27 gold pieces each and thus are only \"pleased,\" not terribly happy.Optimizing your fleet. You want the right balance of ships to be effective in combat (I prefer the maneuverability of a sloop or barque, even when taking on a galleon) but also with enough cargo space for goods and a large crew, but not so much that you slog through the Caribbean at a snail's pace (that's called \"mixing metaphors\").Politics and intelligence. If you want to rise through the ranks among the English, then you have to attack England's enemies and avoid attacking its allies. But enemies and alliances can change constantly, and you have to keep careful track of it. In worst cases, your favored nation is suddenly at war with no one, and you have to resort to peaceful ways to make a living until they get belligerent again. Meanwhile, successfully sacking towns involves keeping track of the town's population, economy, and defenses. As you visit taverns and hail ships, you get news of faraway events, such as new gold mines, plagues, and Indian attacks, all of which change the desirability and ease of plundering those towns. You can also get some intelligence on where the Spanish treasure fleet or silver train is going to be at a particular time, intercept and plunder it, and enjoy a bounty of gold.From this I can discern that Gran Granada and Puerto Bello would make lousy targets right now, but Bermuda might be a ripe fruit, and if Santa Marta has changed hands, I might find a friendly port there now where previously it was hostile.Interpreting treasure maps. As you explore, you'll find random treasure maps, but more important, you'll find maps with clues as to the locations of your family members. Sometimes these maps have sections torn away or hidden, so you have to carefully study the available features and determine where the X is most likely to be. You also have to be sensible about heading off to find treasure--sailing all the way to Central America for 6,000 gold pieces rarely makes sense, for instance, but if you have other business there...This one is comparably easy.Optimizing your travel. Let's say you have a treasure map indicating a point on Cuba, a quest to capture a pirate operating near Panama, and a clue that someone with knowledge of your mother is in Trinidad. Meanwhile, you have a cargo hold full of sugar you want to trade in Port Royale, and it's been six months since you last visited a French port to get a much-deserved promotion. Taking into consideration the season and trade winds, you have to construct something like a traveling salesman algorithm to minimize the amount of time it takes.Eventually, you get older and less healthy, and it's time to retire. The  game gives you a final score, and outlook for the rest of your life,  based on your accumulated wealth, title, and family. The top rank is the  \"king's advisor.\"The original game manual came with a delightful series of embedded commentary called \"memoirs of captain Sydney\" that provided useful clues and context to the game. These were repeated in the 2004 re-release.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Embedded in all of this gameplay is a wealth of information, both historical and technical. Because of this game, I learned a lot about the geography and history of the Caribbean. When I was invited to visit Trinidad and Tobago on business, I knew where it was, and that it had been owned by the Spanish, French, and English at various points in its history. I know that running before the wind is not the most efficient way to sail. And the game teaches real skills about logistics and management. If I thought it was a real CRPG, the answer to \"What have you learned?\" would be easy.For my character, I chose to play in \"The Bucanneer Heroes\" time period, which starts in 1660. I decided that I would be Spanish, but furious that the Spanish system of justice had allowed my family to be robbed and torn apart. I would ally with whoever was an enemy of Spain, and wage war against my former country while simultaneously trying to recover my family members. I chose \"skill at medicine\" for my \"special ability\"; I almost always do, as it prolongs your useful life and increases the chances you'll be able to accomplish all your objectives within your career.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Wit and charm\" would naturally have been more true to life.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As I started the game, Spain was at war with France, so I headed off to find a French port and obtain a letter of marque (another term I learned from this game) allowing me to attack Spanish ships on France's behalf. Tomorrow, I will relate the adventures of Captain Gatomalo but then get back to games that are more defensible as CRPGs.Coincidentally, yesterday I was teaching a day-long class that wasn't going so well, and I grinned as said to myself, \"No matter how the rest of the day goes, tonight you can go home with a bag of Doritos and a six-pack of Coke and play Pirates!\" Well, ha ha, joke was on me, because I couldn't get it to work, and my wife asked when I'd stopped drinking diet, and an entire bag of Doritos doesn't sit so well when you're 40. But now I'm playing again, and all is right with the world. Arrrr."}, {"title": "Pirates!: ThwARRRted", "date": "Thursday, January 20, 2011", "text": "I had all kinds of great material ready for a one-shot (or maybe two-shot) review of Pirates! but I can't get the damned game to work. In part, I'm confused by the game history. The original release was in 1987 for the Commodore 64. MobyGames says there was a DOS release but lists it as 1994, which doesn't make any sense, because by 1994, Pirates! Gold had already been out for a year. Wikipedia lists no DOS release at all but says there was a PC booter version in 1987; apparently, DOSBox can emulate a PC booter but I can't find a download. Meanwhile, I did find a DOS version (from which the screen shot above comes), but the introductory text is different than I remember and the game doesn't work: it keeps freezing after the opening text and battles. I've messed around with the settings in DOSBox to no avail. The existence of this game is a bit mysterious given the insistence of both MobyGames and Wikipedia that it doesn't exist, and I only found it on one abandonware site.So...any ideas? (Other than playing a non-DOS/PC version; that ship has already sailed.) I'll keep trying to figure it out, but in the meantime I'll move on to The Seven Spirits of Ra. Worst case, I have to wait until Pirates! Gold in 1993.Later Edit: problem solved (see comments). I'm still a bit mystified as to the history and origins of this DOS version, but I won't trouble myself too much.

You're hoping to seal the deal with each of them, but you almost always go home alone. Some of them last longer than others. But whether you only make it to Level 1 (a smile), Level 4 (buying them a drink), or Level 12 (a quick snog in a corner), ultimately you usually do something stupid, or just suffer some bad luck, and you have to start over again. (Sod the lot of you at RPGCodex: I'm crafting a metaphor, not describing my own life.)Here's the thing. Even though you rarely, if ever, \"win,\" the game itself is still fun. But fun as it is, there are some times--maybe after your fifth loss in one evening--you can't bring yourself to keep trying. Level 7 (a \"click\" in your conversation) really rocks, but the idea of going through Levels 1-6 to get there is just exhausting. And there are some nights when, thinking about all of this, you can't bring yourself to go to the club at all.This metaphor describes why I decided to start playing other games in the middle of NetHack. You can't go clubbing every night. And though I decided to hit the scene again this evening, I suspect it will be my last time for a while.It turns out that the whole spinach-having-a-high-iron-content thing is a myth.Tonight, playing Valerie the Valkyrie, I made it all the way to dungeon Level 15 and character Level 10. I had 71 hit points and, at one point, 18 strength (thanks in part to a tin of spinach). A series of good scroll finds had boosted my elven cloak to +3 and my long sword to +4. Thanks in part to a treasure chamber, I had an absurd amount of gold--more than 4,000--and I was hoping to find a shop to spend it. I had even figured out how to tame wild dogs by throwing food at them.That's not right.Not all was roses. I had eaten something called a \"tengu\" (apparently a supernatural Japanese dog) on Level 11 and was inflicted with teleportitis. This made owning a pet fairly impossible, but it did help out when I found myself in a room of ghosts I was unable to hit with any weapon or spell (how do you defeat these things?).What the hell is this all about?On Level 15, though, there was nothing but misfortune. First a scroll turned my +3 elven cloak to dust. Then I picked up a spellbook that turned out to be coated with poison, and it reduced my strength by 5.This hurt.Excited by what I first took to be some new armor, I approached it and was attacked by a mimic. When I killed the mimic, I thought I might get some benefit from its corpse, so I ate it. Instead of a benefit, the game told me that I could not resist the temptation to mimic a treasure chest, and it made me go inert while I was stung to death by bees.These guys universally suck, especially in Ultima V.To add insult to injury, I had a ton of unidentified stuff.Still not sure what scrolls of \"blank paper\" do.I was so sure Valerie was going to be \"the one.\" I halfheartedly tried to pick up a tourist, a wizard, and a ninja, but it was no good. Having gotten to Level 15 once tonight, it's going to be a hard time getting back there again.I'm not sure if any of you expected that I would \"ascend\" in NetHack in this first round of playing. If you did, I'm sorry to disappoint you. I'm going to knock off this version for now, and revisit it in 1989 with version 3.0.I need your opinion as to whether I played enough to GIMLET this one. I know later versions have side quests and such, but I don't think this version does.

I won it because I knew that I could. But with the game mechanics, spells, equipment, classes, graphics, gameplay...even the damned villain...identical to Phantasie, it never felt like I was playing anything new or exciting. It is at least a competent game, and not particularly painful, but I don't feel like I missed out on much by playing most of it in front of the TV. The Phantasie series is the embodiment of the trope that TVTropes calls \"Phantasy Spelling\": pointlessly altering the normal spelling of words to seem ancient, exotic, or just pretentious. Fortunately, not all series do this or we'd have to contend with Phinal Phantasie. We've seen other examples of this in the blog, including Faery Tale Adventure and Dunjonquest, and we'll see it again with titles such as Wizard Warz, Vampyr: Talisman of Invocation, and Jinyong Qunxia Zhuan. Seriously, people: who are you trying to impress?I have a lot more readers these days, so I want to make it clear that the GIMLET is supposed to be an objective measure of my own enjoyment of the game. It makes no allowances for the age of the game or the technology level of the times. Oblivion is meant to be compared on the same scale as Akalabeth. Thus, a score of 50 or so in this era would be pretty good, while a score of 75 in the 2000s might be considered quite poor. Before you complain that this isn't fair, keep in mind that my only requirements to get a good score on graphics and sound is that they \"aren't painfully bad.\" A game from this era could have achieved a score in the 80s (though none have, so far) if it combined, say, Starflight's attention to game world and back story, Ultima IV's dialog system, and Might & Magic's variety of quests.Got it? All right. Let's do this:1. Game World. Phantasie III feels derivative of a lot of games, not the least of which its own predecessors, in the game world. The continent of Scandor, aside from the different names of towns and such, is indistinguishable from the worlds of Phantasie, Legacy of the Ancients, Shard of Spring, or any number of other titles. In fact, all of the SSI games seem to suffer this certain banality of story and location. And not only is Scandor facing the \"same old type of threat,\" it is literally facing the same threat--Nikademus--as the previous two outings. With three games to build his personality and backstory, you'd think that the player would have a sense of who Nikademus is and what he's all about, but no, all you know (or even need to know, I guess) is that he's evil. Your quest to destroy him is nonetheless pretty clear, and there are sages and such to help you walk through it. And on the plus side, the funeral for Kilmor was a nice tie to both the manual and the previous games, and unlike the original game, your actions have a permanent effect on the world. Score: 4.And I guess the \"plane\" architecture is semi-cool.2. Character Creation and Development. Unchanged from Phantasie. The classes are standard, the variety of monster races a nice touch. Except the need for a gnome to enter the Gnome Caverns, your choices have no bearing on the storyline. Development seems a little too rapid at the beginning and far too slow towards the end. It literally took me about four hours of constant monster-bashing to rise from Level 15 to Level 16. But leveling up, with its improvement of skills (a nice touch) and spells is satisfying. Score: 4.Training and increasing skills.3. NPC Interaction. There aren't many NPCs in the game, and none with whom you can have any kind of dialog. The few vital ones, like Lord Wood and Filmon, help you advance the story but don't give you much opportunity for role-playing. As in the original game, it's neat how you find scrolls that give you contextual information about the world and its dungeons. Score: 4.4. Encounters and Foes. Again, I could largely just paste my comments for Phantasie here: many monsters but oddly undistinguished except in the strength of their attacks and the damage done by their spells. You have some minor role-playing options in deciding whether to fight, greet (hardly ever worked), threaten (never worked), or beg mercy (who does this?) from your enemies. I do like that there were both random and fixed encounters and enemies respawned; without this, I wouldn't have built up my characters enough to win. Score: 4.5. Magic and Combat. Battle tactics redeem some of the bad elements of the game. Since you can only rest and heal in towns, you have to take care in every encounter, especially in dungeons. If you think you can just breeze through the battle with orcs, you might take just enough damage to give you trouble when you encounter more serious foes later on. Carefully planning battles is the only way to win, and with its multiple attack, defense, and spell options, the game gives you a lot of planning to do. Do I try to wipe out a host of creatures with SWING or do I target the spellcaster in the back rank with my bow? Should I use Firebolt IV here or save my magic points for tougher battles ahead? I like making these kinds of choices, and Phantasie III is really second only to Wizardry in the tactical nature of its combat. In the original Phantasie, I complained that most of the battles were too easy, rendering these tactics moot, but that's definitely not true in this game. Only the paltry selection of really usable spells, and a banal spellcasting system, keeps this category from getting a really \"good\" score. Score: 6.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 6. Equipment. There is a lot of variety to the weapons, bows, armor, and other items in the game, and the game is very clear about the relative value in terms of protection or damage, which I like. The \"distribution\" system is a bit cumbersome, and it sucks that you can't use powerful items the moment you find them--you have to return to a town first. There are no item descriptions, no artifacts, and nothing very unique, though. Score: 5.7. Economy. Big, scrawled letter F. Any game that lets you end with over 4 million gold pieces doesn't understand the value of gold. There are shops in the town, but none sell anything better than what you can pick up outside. Give me things I can buy with these shiny pieces! It's only good at the beginning stages when you're suffering for gold for training, and every salvaged dagger is a step closer to a new level. Score: 2.I hate this.8. Quests. The main quest is a retread of the previous games, and there aren't really any sidequests, aside from a couple of small extra dungeons. The dual-ending of the main quest is rare for a game of this era, but I don't really count it as a \"role-playing\" decision because you don't make your choice until literally the last minute. Score: 3.9. Graphics, Sound, Inputs. They're tolerable. The sound features squishes and crunches and got a little better after Phantasie; the graphics (in the PC version) are the same as its predecessor--not painful, but not interesting. Keyboard controls are intuitive enough if a bit cumbersome when assigning battle actions. Score: 3.10. Gameplay. The game world is so small that it's hard to call the gameplay \"non-linear\" even if you can literally go anywhere from the beginning. Functionally, the difficulty of monsters and the need to go through certain scripted events makes the game something of a railroad, although as I said there are a few dungeons that you can explore on your own time. Aside from the alternate ending (which you can get by simply reloading), there's no reason to play the game a second time. Heck, there's almost no reason to play again after playing the first game. Score: 4.The final score of 39 matches the original Phantasie exactly. Although III suffers from being a retread, its tactical combat system, which I probably didn't spend enough time on, makes up those lost points. I'm not sad that there isn't an English Phantasie IV, and that SSI would soon move on to cooler things.Time to finish up the first NetHack, and then you're all going to forgive me for a brief detour into Pirates!"}, {"title": "Phantasie III: Nikademus Wins", "date": "Monday, January 17, 2011", "text": "You thought this was going to be an \"I'm giving up\" posting, didn't you?But so do I!

Physically, all I had to do was get through the Castle of Darkness, one small outdoor map, and Nikademus's castle. In reality, this took a couple of days because I needed to engage in a massive level-building effort.The Castle of Darkness. Being a mirror image of the Castle of Light, a screenshot of Light helped me avoid traps in Dark.The trouble came first in the Castle of Darkness, where waves of devils, vampires, and high-level mages assaulted my party and, ultimately, wiped them all out. My visit to the Astral Plane didn't go so well, and four of my characters were turned into undead (they had been around Level 12 before), meaning I essentially had to start over from scratch. Slowly, I built my way up to Level 11-12 again, re-assailed the castle a second time, and lost my entire party again, although this time losing just two to undead status. Crikey.Fortunately, my wife and I have an annual January tradition of watching the entire Lord of the Rings saga on a single Sunday, so I spent yesterday in front of the TV but simultaneously playing the game. The Plane of Dark offers up some fairly tough but rarely fatal battles, so I literally spent all day on this one map, wandering around and slaughtering monsters, finally getting all of my characters up to Level 16. I also explored the map and came across two \"optional\" dungeons, one in which a nice old man offered me bowls of soup that increased any statistics I chose.\u00a0 I used the increases on constitution (some of the characters were in the single digits after multiple resurrections). The old man turned out to be Nikademus in disguise, but the attribute increases still held. The other dungeon was a series of dragon caves that yielded a lot of treasure I didn't need--by the end of the game, I was well over the $4 million mark.These guys look more difficult than they were.When I went back to the Castle of Darkness, it became clear that in my zeal to avoid a repeat of Saturday, I overdid it a bit. The battles weren't easy, but I got through the dungeon fairly quickly and found a room in which I had the choice to do several things with a wand.I didn't try \"straticonuble,\" but it doesn't even show up in a Google search, so I'm guessing it didn't do anything.Messages sprinkled throughout the Castle had spelled a message: \"Welcome, adventurers, to my castle. If you join me in my evil ways and destroy Lord Wood, you will be greatly rewarded. To find me, break the wand in the magic circle in my room.\" Thus, I broke the wand I had found in the first dungeon and was granted passage to another plane, where I at last found Nikademus's Castle.The Plane of Death. I kept getting hurt by erupting volcanoes.His castle was about as hard as the Castle of Dark--the high devils were particularly difficult--but by then I had some major damage spells like Firebolt IV and plenty of magic potions, so I got through it in one try. There were a lot of secret doors which made navigation difficult. At last, I came across the evil sorcerer. I remembered to cast \"spell 57,\" which a wizard in the Gnome Caverns had given me. The spell summoned none other than Lord Wood.\u00a0 Here's where things took an interesting turn. Nikademus told me that my actions had been \"completely evil\" (I guess that was the consequence of smashing those statues in the Castle of Light) and I could join him by killing Lord Wood.\u00a0 The game gave me the option of attacking Wood or Nikademus. I thought about it and decided, what the hell do I care about this idiotic land for? I'd rather rule in hell than serve in heaven. That sort of thing. Thus, I launched myself at Lord Wood and brought him down quite quickly in a barrage of swords, bows, and Fireflash spells.\"More like Lord Wuss!\"Next thing I know, Pluto, god of the Underworld, was personally congratulating me for my evilness and encouraging me to teach others my evil ways. And I guess Nikademus gets to take over the land. Well done me.All right, all right. I couldn't just leave it at that. I re-loaded and made another trip through Nikademus's castle and this time killed Nikademus. He was even easier than Wood. In fact, neither of them were anywhere near as hard as any of the random battles in the castle.Nice skirt, Nikki!In any case, this time I found myself in front of Zeus with an identically worded congratulations, only this time with \"evil\" replaced by \"good.\"\u00a0 Both endings load you up with equipment and experience points and then let you continue playing the game. I generally like this in later CRPGs, but in this era, where none of the NPCs even acknowledge that you've won the game, it seems rather pointless.Awesome. This will come in handy in Phantasie IV: There Aren't Any More Sequels So No It Won't.This isn't the first game to offer \"good\" and \"evil\" endings; Wizardry IV offered several of both types. But it's still unusual for the era.After winning, I read Andrew Schultz's walkthrough (I covered Schultz and his work a few months ago) and discovered that I missed a bunch of stuff. First, there was an entire dungeon--Lord Wood's tent--that I must have mistaken for a town or inn when I walked by. Apparently, I was supposed to battle my way to him and get the final quest to kill Nikademus. Whoops. More important, some of your dialog varies if you imported characters who won previous Phantasie games. The sage Filmon, who bafflingly said he chose my party because \"Nikademus would never suspect us\" says something else to a party who has previously won: \"because you have proven yourself worthy of the task.\" It's still unexplained why Nikademus keeps reappearing, but I guess whereas my Level 8 priest can resurrect my characters, and Nikademus is a multi-dimensional villain who has his own castle in the Netherworld and is favored by the god Pluto, I can allow the series some artistic license.GIMLET coming up, and then I promise I'll finish up with NetHack."}, {"title": "Phantasie III: Overdose", "date": "Sunday, January 16, 2011", "text": "The party faces off against five incarnations of Gandalf the Grey.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the last 24 hours, I've done two things that I hate doing:1. Played so much of a game that I'm thoroughly sick of it.2. Didn't keep careful notes while playing and now have to compose a long blog posting using memory fragments and random screenshots.It's possible to overdose on even the best games. Phantasie III is one of those games without good stopping points. The action is fairly fast, and the puzzles are light. You almost always know exactly where you're going to go next, and there doesn't seem to be any reason not to do it now. Hours go by as you maneuver from one dungeon to the next. Suddenly it's dark--where did the day go? Suddenly it's midnight--where did the evening go? You head off to bed vaguely disgusted with yourself for not accomplishing anything else during the day.And I'm prolonging it with blathering. All right, let me cover the story: when I last wrote, I was about to head off to the Dwarven Burial Grounds for Lord Kilmor's funeral. Oddly, when I got there, I was attacked at various places by dwarves and priests. I felt rather bad about slaughtering them all. The same thing happened in the Gnome Caverns a few hours later. I had a cordial talk with the Gnome King and he gave me a really nice bow, but I massacred hundreds of his followers in the corridors. A little suspension of roleplaying disbelief was necessary.The continuity with previous games is a nice touch.The funeral featured dignitaries from the previous Phantasie games, including Lord Wood of Gelnor, who I thought had died in the original game, but maybe that was his uncle. In any event, he's dead now. Nikademus showed up during the funeral, started tossing fireballs, and turned everyone (except me, oddly) to char.Sign us up!I returned to the sage Filmon and received a mission to go to the Chamber of Chronis, keeper of time and dimensions, so he could send me on to the Castle of Light. But before I did that, I explored the Gnome Caverns, an apparently stand-alone dungeon unrelated to the main quest.I haven't posted a lot of dungeon maps, so here's one.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There I solved a couple of puzzles to obtain some nice bows. Bows, I find, do less damage than melee weapons, but in the hands of a character with a lot of skill, they greatly increase the chances of an immediate fatal wound. The random monsters in the Gnome Caverns were quite tough, and my characters all advanced to Levels 11-12. Oh, and in one of the rooms, a wizard took all my gold and experience for a powerful spell of summoning that he swore would help me later.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The solution to this involved foul-smelling liquid that repelled the viper.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also before visiting Chronis, I battled my way to the end of the long windy corridor in the Pendragon Town Archives, fighting progressively more difficult monsters. At the end was something called the Wand of Nikademus, which the game told me was cursed. Not the treasure I was hoping for. A scroll explained a little more about it:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This scroll becomes a lot more fun if you imagine Mickey Mouse's dog taking the wand from Nikademus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chronis turned out to be an absent-minded, narcoleptic sage who fell asleep while I was talking to him. In his chambers, though, I found the codes necessary to activate his device and transport myself to the Plane of Light, and the key I needed to admit myself to the castle.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chronis's tower.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I also came across a scroll that gave me a handy map of the planes. The Dungeons & Dragons influence is obvious.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 On the Plane of Light, I found the Castle of Light and used the key to  gain admittance. Here I made a possibly-fatal mistake. There were  several statues of beings (a dwarf, an elf, and so on) in various rooms.  My only options to deal with them were to leave them alone or to smash  them, and since leaving them alone didn't sound like much of any  adventure, I smashed them. It was only later, writing this blog and  looking at my screen shots, that I realized Filmon had warned me that  destroying anything in the Castle of Light was \"terribly evil.\" He  actually reminded me twice. Between the Gnome Caverns and finishing the  Pendragon Town Archives, I forgot. Bollocks. It didn't seem to affect  anything in the castle, but I don't know what I set myself up for later.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Just terribly evil? Or are we talking really terribly evil?\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A fairy in the castle told me to go ahead and move on to the Castle of Dark, which I could access by doing the \"opposite\" of what I did to get on the Plane of Light. Getting to the Plane of Light required entering a code (C2+) in Chronis's machine. Since there's no \"opposite\" of C or 2, I figured it was just a matter of entering C2-, and I was right. But I forgot to stop by the Hall of Giants again and get the Key of Dark (it was in a room I couldn't access on my first visit), so I have to head back there.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Right now, all my characters are Levels 12-13 out of a possible 20, but boy has the leveling slowed down. None of them have leveled in the last 2 hours of playing. Meanwhile, the mystics that you find in every town tell me that my score is 43 and my characters are \"average.\" I suspect this means I'm about halfway through.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I actually think we're rather exceptional.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other miscellaneous notes:I owe the game an apology. Last night, I suggested that your ability to reset dungeons broke the role-playing immersion by allowing you to experience fixed encounters over and over again. It turns out this isn't true (although it was in the first Phantasie). When I reset the Hall of Giants and returned to where I found Lord Kilmor's body, the game told me there was just a bloodstain there. Similarly, resetting the Dwarven Burial Grounds does not cause the funeral to occur again; I just found charred bodies.Money stopped being a problem 'round about the Gnome Caverns. I have hundreds of thousands of gold now. You know how I feel about that.The resurrection spell means I don't really \"lose\" characters any more, but I have a couple of them who are facing very low constitution because of repeated resurrections.I realized belatedly that there's a \"change rank\" option in combat that lets you assign party members to the front, middle, or rear. Those in the rear can still be hit by melee weapons of enemies, but apparently they have a lower risk. I have the resurrection spell now, but using it costs a point of constitution, so I'd rather stop having to raise my wizard. I put him in the rear rank.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That's the kind of thing it would have been nice to notice at the beginning.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I've accessed some fairly powerful magic spells. Three of my characters have Fireflash IV, the real workhorse from the original game. There aren't a lot of area effect spells, but I just got Mind Blast IV, which works fairly well. Other entire-party spells like confusion, weakness, binding, protection, and quickness I haven't used much. You don't really see their effects, so I'm not sure how well they work.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the spells, my characters have what seems to me really low spell points. They're all around 15-18. That means I can cast four level 4 spells before I have to return to the inn to rest or use a magic potion (which, admittedly, are rather plentiful). That doesn't last very long in these dungeons.Some of the areas of the game I have to access by swimming across bodies of water. There's a swimming skill that reduces or eliminates damage.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Doing this in armor takes a lot of skill. Remind me to do a \"special topics\" posting on this when I get to Oblivion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have to focus on some work tomorrow, so I might play a little NetHack since it seems to lend itself better to short gaming sessions. Or, at least, it tends to force short gaming sessions upon you."}, {"title": "Phantasie III: Over the Hump", "date": "Friday, January 14, 2011", "text": "Distributing experience to boost the priest.Reader Arkadesh left some advice after my last post that made sense (and that, frankly, I should have been able to figure out for myself): channel as much experience as possible into the priest character until he's able to cast Healing III (which heals amputations). Once this happened, things got a bit easier although not \"easy.\" I still had a lot of character turnover. Ultimately, I got my party stabilized at around Level 8. Danger remains until I acquire resurrection, though.Phantasie III, like its predecessors, gives you the ability to alter the \"shares\" of experience received by each character for each successful combat. You do this upon entering a town. You can't give each character less than 1 share nor more than 3, so it's not completely unbalanced. And while it makes no sense from a roleplaying standpoint, it is a great feature when you find your party in a constant state of turnover.The mostly-completed Pendragon town archives.With my party no longer in constant fear of dismemberment, I explored most of the Town Archives south of Pendragon. As in Phantasie, exploration slowly reveals parts of the maps, with special encounters represented by little balls. These can be treasures, NPCs, or puzzles. One was reminiscent of Telengard:Choosing to \"destroy it\" was not my smartest option; I was slain by some kind of demon.Among the items found in the archives are scrolls that (again, like in Phantasie) slowly help explain the game world and its history, geography, people, and features. They also summarize the previous games but without acknowledging the fact that Nikademus died in them.Phantasie III: One big retcon.I learned that the current continent, Scandor, is the \"center of the civilized world\" and that the continents from the previous games are to the south. North of Scandor is the Great Northern Continent, occupied by trolls and giants that occasionally raid the mainland. Nikademus has been tied up in his conquering of the northern part of Scandor by Kilmor, a great dwarf leader. There was also a general (but largely useless) map on Scroll IV.Moments later, I was on the astral plane.I say that I explored \"most of\" the dungeon because on the west side there's a long corridor that throws numerous encounters at me, escalating the difficulty swiftly. I lost my entire party in this corridor twice, so I think I'll save the rest for later.Um...WHY would he never suspect us, exactly?More important, an encounter with a \"wise old sage\" named Filmon provided my first quest: to rescue Kilmor from the Hall of Giants. The Hall of Giants, located by the sea in the southern part of the continent, proved to be difficult but not impossible. The giants themselves (there were several varieties) yielded a large amount of experience, equipment, and gold (although my gold still lags behind the amount I need to fully train), and I entered a wrestling  match for a +1 constitution increase. When I found Kilmor, he was dead......but he left a scroll that recounted his capture and torture at the hands of Nikademus. Returning to the sage Filmon, I was given another quest to go to the Dwarven Burial Grounds, attend Kilmor's funeral, and mingle with the VIPs there.Like the first game in the series, Phantasie III is shaping up to be fairly linear in its quests. I suppose theoretically, I could stalk off in a random direction and explore whatever dungeon I choose, but practically I'd get myself slaughtered.Three other miscellaneous things:The game features a very annoying form of copy protection. It appears that every time you move your party to a special encounter, there's a random chance that a question will appear, and it seems to happen about 33% of the time. The questions ask arcana from the game manual. It wouldn't be so bad if it was 5% or 10% of the time, but as it is, I have to keep poring through this PDF file.You have the option to reset dungeons upon re-entry, at which point the game \"forgets\" the map and all the encounters you already experienced. It's a good way to load up on gold and experience, but it somewhat breaks the fourth wall when you can find Kilmor's body again and again.The monsters yield consistent equipment by type. Every party of rangers offers up hammers and medium shields +1. Scribes always have level 3 healing potions and robes. Undead gnomes: small axes and small shields +2. I don't exactly mind, as these items sell for decent money, but some randomization would have been better. Since there doesn't seem to be any downside to keeping equipment, I'm not sure why the game even bothers to ask.I'm not done with NetHack just yet, but I'm on something of a roll with Phantasie III, so I think I'll keep with it until I get bored or it's over, then return to NetHack. Lots of travel this week and next, so please bear with me if my postings start to slack."}, {"title": "Phantasie III: A Hard Start", "date": "Tuesday, January 11, 2011", "text": "This is known as an \"inauspicious start.\"I've been on the road the last few days and not playing much, but partly I've been so silent 'cause I can't seem to get anywhere. The beginning stages of Phantasie III are surprisingly hard--at least, unless I'm missing something. Battles routinely leave my characters bereft of limbs, and I cannot find a single town that sells healing potions sufficient to repair the damage. My quest to do so took me into some areas I wasn't yet ready to face, and as you can see from the screen shot above, I ended up losing most of my party. This has happened multiple times. Yikes.Even the first dungeon is a bit too hard for Level 1 characters, so I decided to spend a little time wandering the wilderness and building up my statistics--specifically, wandering right around Pendragon, the starting town, since the monsters seem to get more difficult the further you get away. Still, it's clear from my limited wanderings that either Scandor is a busier place than the Phantasie I kingdom, or the game world is smaller. There's a town on practically every screen. Too bad none of them sell Level 7 healing potions.We're a bunch of cowards.To try to get anywhere in the game, I've been resorting to a tactic I'm usually loathe to employ: running away. The consequences of a bad battle are so severe that I turn tail if it looks like I can't handle it. It doesn't always work, though, and of course I often misjudge whether I can \"handle it.\" In my current party, most of the characters are Level 4, but I have a wizard with no legs and a priest with only one leg. What am I missing when it comes to healing? Could SSI have really made a game this punishing?Do I target the tough barbarian rank first, or the easy kobold rank?The difficulty doesn't mean I'm not enjoying it. In fact, Phantasie III returns me to something like Wizardry-level tactical combat. Specifically:Since I cannot save in between towns and I can only fully heal in towns, the difficultly rests in the accumulation of encounters more than individual encounters. I must carefully weigh whether to press on to the next dungeon room or whether to just get out of here. Combats are random and frequent, and I always need to plan on the possibility of several fights on the way out.Within individual encounters, there are tough choices. Aiming, attacking, thrusting, and firing bows have different levels of effectiveness on different enemies. I must also consider how to target my attacks by enemy rank and when to use my limited spell points.Fleeing is a gamble because if it doesn't work, the enemy gets a free round of attacks.If only \"keep limbs intact\" was a skill.SSI has also introduced its skill system from Wizard's Crown, so every time I level up, I can allocate points to attack, parry, swimming, listen, find trap, disarm trap, find item, pick lock, and fire bow. Even this requires a bit of strategy.  At first I just concentrated on attack skills for most characters and allocated the thief skills only to the thief. Later I realized that at this rate, my thief would never really advance far in anything.When death arrives for the entire party, you find yourselves on the Astral Plane, where a great demon judges each character and decides whether to a) resurrect him; b) turn him into an undead. If the latter option occurs, it appears that the character advances to Level 20 but can no longer be trained or advance in skills after that. Resurrected characters lose their gold and one point of constitution.I guess that's a step up from being just \"dead.\"Due to the game's difficulty (or my ineptitude), I couldn't play long enough to give you any more insights, but I did make this recording of the gameplay. In it, you can see my crippled party do pretty well against a succession of enemies before I press too far into the dungeon and get my ass kicked by a couple of giants. My battered party tries to limp its way to the exit, but repeated battles leave all of the characters dead. Three are ultimately resurrected and three are made undead; I ditch those three.Finally, I'm having the same problem that I had in Phantasie with my characters being ready to level up but not having enough gold to pay for the training. I need to pay more attention to charisma next time I roll new characters. Oh, and one other kicker: the characters age, meaning I can't dither around Pendragon forever.I've got to be missing something regarding the healing, right?"}, {"title": "Game 39: Phantasie III: The Wrath of Nikademus (1987)", "date": "Friday, January 7, 2011", "text": "Source: MobyGames\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Phantasie III: The Wrath of NikademusUnited StatesStrategic Simulations, Inc.

It's from the Amiga version. I had to use it because some sort of corruption afflicted the only abandonware DOS download I could find, giving an error upon starting the game and entering towns (and doesn't display the town graphic). It still seems to save and everything else works okay. But the game is still reliant on the CGA standard and is a bare step up from monochrome.Now, I can already hear you saying, \"CRPG Addict, we warned you about this. Way back in your first posting, Gooberslot told you that you'd be missing out on the best version of many games. Just play the Amiga version for the love of god!\" And I basically agree with you, except that I'm almost out of the \"DOS version sucks\" era, I really don't feel like learning another emulator (not to mention another OS), and if I start using other emulators now, I have no excuse for not having played Questron or, for that matter, Phantasie II. [Ed. I ultimately played them both: Questron and Phantasie II.]Everything I've read about Phantasie II (by way of uncomfortable segue after not really dealing with the issue) suggests that it was so similar to the first game that SSI didn't even bother to write a separate manual. The only gameplay addition was that players could now throw rocks. The villain in that game, by the way, was again Nikademus, and it had something to do with an orb.As the back story to the third edition opens, a nameless adventurer strides into an inn in the town of Pendragon on the continent of Scandor, where the innkeeper informs him of the menace presented by...wait for it...Nikademus. Seriously, SSI? I know it's been a while, but let me refresh your memory: the player kills Nikademus in both Phantasie and Phantasie II. Under what possible logic is he alive? He's like the Freddy Krueger of CRPGs, just showing up again, with no explanation, despite having been conquered by the hero in the last installment. Did you have trouble thinking of a name? There are lots of great villain names even among the other Pharisees alone. How about Gamaliel? Shammai? Yohanan ben Zakkai? Okay, that one doesn't work. [Much later edit: 5 years after I won the first Phantasie and 4 years after I played this game, an anonymous reader corrected a longstanding misapprehension: you don't defeat Nikademus in the first game; you defeat the Black Lord, leader of his Black Knights. Moreover, you don't fight Nikademus directly in #2, either. Thus, my gentle ribbing of SSI was unwarranted.]Continuing with the story, the absurdly enthusiastic adventurer......headed off to the guild to assemble his party.We needn't linger too long on character creation, which hasn't advanced terribly since Phantasie, which I covered last April. There are five key races (humans, dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings), with the attribute bonuses you would expect, plus the option to choose a \"random\" race and get a gnoll, goblin, kobold, lizard man, minotaur, ogre, orc, pixie, sprite, or troll. These beasts excel in one statistic or another but can only be fighters or thieves and end up paying very high training costs because of racism. Non-beasts can also be monks, priests, rangers, and wizards. Ultimately, all character classes can cast some spells, but of course some are more efficient than others. Character attributes are the standard selection of Dungeons & Dragons stats, minus wisdom.I like to experience a bit of everything, so my motley party consists of:Macabeu, a human monk and nominal \"leader\" of this revolt against NikademusEzra, an elf wizard and part-time \"scribe\"Koziba, a dwarven rangerJoseph, a gnomish priest from ArimatheaAntonin, a halfling thiefHyrcano, a minotaur fighterCharacters start off with a randomly-assigned \"social class\" that indicates how much gold he or she receives from leveling. There are supposedly four levels: peasant, laborer, craftsman, and noble, but all of my characters are either peasants or laborers. It's a very working-class party.The game world. Your party is represented by a horse's head. I guess that's better than the alternative.The characters start off with a decent amount of equipment, but no gold, so the only thing to do is head out the door on the adventure. The manual suggests the first place to visit is the Pendragon town archives, just south of Pendragon, so that's where I went. The dungeons work much as in the first game, which I indicated may have been the first game to slowly reveal the map as you explore.Joseph is having a little trouble getting around right now.Having explored some of the wilderness and the first dungeon, these are some \"upgrades\" to Phantasie III from the original version:All characters have bows. My ranger started with a \"short bow,\" but everyone else has a \"self bow\"--I assume that means they just throw things?\u00a0Combat is a little more complicated. It takes place on two screens--one where you line up your actions for the round, and one in which you see the actions' results. The same core actions from Phantasie are here: thrust (one solid swing), attack (two medium swings), slash (three or four light swings), lunge (attack in second rank), and cast a spell. But new abilities are the options to fire a bow (at any rank), and carefully aim an attack at a monster's vital area (that would be his head or torso, snickerers). He should go into theater.In addition to hit point damage, both monsters and PCs can take bodily injuries, a feature that I believe first showed up in SSI's Wizard's Crown. These injuries include simple injuries, breaks, and amputations. Thus, you can have the odd sight of a character with all his hit points but missing both legs. Breaks and injuries heal through rest and spells, but amputations can only heal through high-level spells and potions. I like the injury system because of the realism, the additional tactics it brings to combat, and the fact that seeing \"orc is decapitated!\" never gets old. Unfortunately,  on my first trip out, Joseph the priest lost both of his legs and  Hyrcano the Minotaur lost one of his legs. I don't have high enough spells to heal them, and none of the towns in the starting area sell high-enough potions. A lesser role-player might just ditch the disabled members and replace them, but I'm not as cruel as that. Thus, my first mission in the game is not to explore the first dungeon but to find a town that sells at least a Healing Potion 7 so Paul and Hyrcano can walk again.I will be playing Phantasie III side-by-side with NetHack, so expect postings on both over the next week or so."}, {"title": "NetHack: Playing, Dying, Screaming, Restarting", "date": "Wednesday, January 5, 2011", "text": "Damned thing lived up to its name. You have to give it that.Things have been tough on the little @.Paul the Priest, who I reported in my last posting on NetHack, was \"doubtless my most successful hero so far,\" lived about five more steps after I made that posting. He stumbled into a nest of killer bees and died instantly at a poisonous stinger. In my first posting on Rogue, I wrote: \"Most of the time it takes to win Rogue involves playing, dying, screaming, and restarting at Level 1.\" This has not changed in NetHack. My adventures follow a reasonably predictable pattern. Two or three characters barely make it out of the gate, but then one starts to develop legs. She's going places. I get her up to character level 5 and maybe dungeon level 5 or 6. She's got some good equipment, spells. The future's bright.I almost always see it coming before it happens. A couple of killer bees float down the hallway. My status changes to \"weak\" with no food in sight. The word \"poison\" appears in some context. A trio of orcs surrounds me when I have 10/40 hit points. I start mumbling the Litany Against Death: \"No. No. No, no, no, no, nononononono...F&$%!\" DYWYPI?The obscenities that follow get creative. Shocking suggestions for the game's mother. The Christian messiah on an eclectic variety of conveyances. I think I used \"God-sucking\" at one point. Then a sigh. A brief contemplation of Phantasie III. And I restart.NetHack is a better game than Rogue, but it's no less frustrating, no less punishing, no less fundamentally masochistic--and no less addictive.Some things since my last outing:Food is a tremendous pain in the neck. I'd hoped with the corpses and the occasional monster dropping food, I wouldn't starve as easily as in Rogue. Nothing doing. I seem to have the worst luck with eating food that turns out to be spoiled or rotten, or corpses that turn out to drain my strength or poison me.Missile weapons strike me as effectively useless, although I need to play a little more to be sure. I don't notice many monsters until they're right on top of me.I notice that just when I most need to cast spells--when I'm hungry, for instance--the game tells me I'm too weak.I keep finding things that provide light, but I've yet to encounter a place where I'd need them.The game seems to save information about previous characters that have died. I encountered the \"Ghost of Victoria\"--my valkyrie--on Level 6, along with all of her stuff. I picked it up greedily but it turned out to be cursed.Thankfully, the game doesn't have you encounter ghosts of ALL your previous adventurers, or the dungeons would be choked with them.I've noticed that some things can only be hit with magic weapons, including \"fog clouds\" and ghosts. Not all of my characters have magic weapons, even by Level 5 or 6, but fortunately the valkyrie starts with one. One level featured Larry, Curly, and Moe. Really? This is just the sort of non-sequitur I was talking about yesterday. They kept following me and engaging in slapstick. Unfortunately for them, they decided to bother me when I was playing a barbarian, and I had no qualms about bashing them to pulp.NyuckHackPraying only works once every few levels. Otherwise the gods get mad and give you a good wallopping.Although I have some favorite classes--barbarian, valkyrie, and wizard--I've been letting the game pick for me at the beginning of each session. It keeps it interesting. I'm not a fan of the tourist.The lowest level I've reached so far is Level 8, and I've made it here a couple of times. I've been noticing that Levels 5 and 6 start throwing some really hard stuff at you. My last outing, Level 6 seemed to be on mushrooms--none of the objects were represented by their standard icons, monsters kept changing, and I was ultimately killed by a \"hallucinogen-distorted centaur.\"I think this was actually all one creature.One of the times I reached Level 8, I got hit by a \"quantum mechanic\" which teleported me into the middle of a throne room full of orcs. Naturally, I didn't last long.\"Hi! No, don't get up!\"I've encountered stores of three different types: general stores, armor stores, and a book (scroll) store. I'm sure there are more.On one level, a leprechaun stole half my gold and teleported away. I chased the little bugger around from room to room until I finally killed him and got my gold back (wasting almost all of my food in the process). Then I spitefully ate his corpse. Soon I found myself inflicted with a condition whereby I would randomly teleport to another part of the level every 50 turns or so. Does this go away? It actually wasn't as detrimental as it sounds.The fountains are too dangerous to drink from. One spawned five or six pools of water in which I drowned; another released a water demon that killed me.I'm developing a long list of monsters I hate: acid blobs (for ruining your weapons), cockatrices (turn you to stone), leprechauns (steal your gold), nymphs (seduce you and steal your things), giant ants (damage your strength), floating eyes (freeze you so other monsters can pummel you). I can't wait to see how much worse they get on lower levels.NetHack, I find, does not reward long play sessions--at least not for me. In a long playing session in which I started and lost 35 characters, I recorded at which dungeon level they died. The trendline definitely decreases over time as I get more and more frustrated and stop taking care with my characters.I think I'm going to start tracking the classes, too, and see which ones I'm most successful with. Something about NetHack makes me think it requires analysis.From the comments, I'm finding that most of you know a lot more about NetHack than I do. While it must be mildly amusing to watch a n00b blunder his way through the game, there are so many other sources for NetHack information on the Internet that my own blog is likely redundant. I think I'll get started with Phantasie III and return to NetHack occasionally for the next couple of weeks, letting you know if anything new happens.I was role-playing before there were CRPGs. (Source: Wikipedia.)The first video game I ever owned was an Atari 2600 cartridge called Space Invaders. Those of you my age will remember it immediately. It was the simplest of games. You controlled a ship (or just a laser cannon, maybe) that moved back and forth across the bottom of the screen, trying to wipe out waves and waves of alien ships. In the arcade, a similar game--which I was also quite good at--was Galaga.There was no way to \"win\" Space Invaders, just like there's no way to win Tetris. All you could do was accumulate as many points as possible while holding off your inevitable demise. This never sat well with me, so I constructed a story around the game: I was a fighter pilot who bravely volunteered to stay behind and kill as many aliens as possible while waves of escape ships took humanity's remnants from Earth. Every point in my score was another human who made it off the planet alive. Although it was a fanciful elaboration on what I was doing, nothing in the game contradicted it, and I had fun with the additional element my imagination provided.The enjoyment that others experienced with Pac-Man, on the other hand, always eluded me. The game was exciting enough, and I'm not saying that I didn't spend a lot of quarters on it, but I couldn't construct any sort of narrative around it. There was no way to rationalize a giant yellow mouth eating dots and menaced by cartoon ghosts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Though some have tried. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I did similar things with other games. When the first Windows computers came with Solitaire, I would play Vegas style (you pay for each hand but accumulate cash with each successful placement) and pretend my disapproving wife was sitting next to me as I tried to win enough money to pay the mortgage for the year. Minesweeper, on the other hand, is perhaps more tactical, but less plausible from a narrative standpoint.I was thinking about these simpler games in a recent quest, prompted by NetHack, to try to figure out what makes some games \"role-playable\" and others completely hopeless as role-playing material despite being, ostensibly, \"CRPGs.\" When I say, \"role-playable,\" I'm not necessarily talking about in-game role-playing such as dialog choices and decisions based on class or alignment--these are all important, but are mostly absent from early CRPGs. I'm talking, rather, about narratives that the player can imagine externally to the game in front of him or her. This could include any combination of:Mentally envisioning the environment through which your character progressesDeveloping a detailed backstory for your characterInventing dialog between your party members or party members and NPCsInventing quests for your charactersResolving quests in ways that the game does not intend, or that does not give you maximum experience (e.g., just attack Mae'var in Baldur's Gate II because you \"don't work with thieves\", collect all the Threads of the Webspinner in Morrowind but dump them in the ocean to ensure they'll never be used) Refusing to do things that you know how to do until your in-game character knows how to do them (e.g., when I play Ultima V, I'll already know all the mantras because of Ultima IV, but I could refuse to use them until my character learns them)Taking time to do things like undress, eat, sleep, and socialize (much easier in modern CRPGs like Oblivion; there's actually a whole page on stuff like this)Making decisions that do not help game progression--that may even hamper progression--in an attempt to be consistent with a character or ethos (letting fleeing enemies flee, buying drinks at the pub that do nothing for you, donating to churches, eating only vegetarian items in NetHack, refusing to let magic users accompany your inquisitor-led party in Baldur's Gate II)Some of these items sound silly, I suppose--like a kid playing with his Star Wars figures--but hell, thousands of tabletop RPGers do it every day, using modules as their frameworks as I use the CRPG frameworks--so I'm not going to feel completely lame about it. In any event, everyone does it, if only to say, \"your ass is mine\" when they encounter the big boss or \"boo-ya!\" when they defeat him (if you don't at least say that, why are you playing?).So if this is \"role-playing\" in CRPGs, what makes some CRPGs particularly good about it and others not? I would submit that it's partly about non-linearity, which I've already covered, but also partly how well the structure and elements of the story hold up to scrutiny. It has nothing to do with the bells and whistles attached to the game. Wizardry is bare-bones, and yet it can be enormously fun imagining your party creeping carefully through the Proving Grounds, hoping to get out alive. Ultima II, on the other hand, is as technically advanced as Wizardry, but I found it impossible to construct a sober narrative out of it, with its stealing and spaceships and goofy pop-culture references. If the CRPG developers have given you a structure and game elements that lend themselves to a complex narrative without falling apart, the \"RP\" part of the \"CRPG\" is strong.Try this exercise: imagine a CRPG that you know fairly well. Now imagine that you've been tapped to write the novelization of the game, or a movie screenplay based on it. You have four parameters:You must keep the basic beginning, ending, and main quest of the game.You must include all of the story elements that the game includes.You must not include anything that contradicts any of the material in the game.As long as you adhere to the first three restrictions, you can include as much additional or extraneous material as you want.Now imagine whether, based on these parameters, you could write a book or screenplay that would hold together--that anyone would actually want to see, and that wouldn't ruin your career.Try it with Ultima IV. You can make your protagonist a recently-released convict, a disaffected teenager, a university professor, or a hardened street cop--none of these options contradicts the character creation in the game. Suddenly, he's whisked through a moongate to another world--no problem there; plenty of good movies and books feature magic. He has a long period in which he's disoriented and doesn't know what to do (the game doesn't show this, but neither does it preclude this). He finally makes his way to the sovereign, Lord British, and learns about why he's there--the conversation in the game isn't very cinematic, but remember you can add additional dialog, as long as you retain all of the dialog in the game. Dupre has to be a paladin and Katrina has to be a shepherd, and both must accompany your protagonist, but nothing says you can't construct a love triangle among them. And so on. There's nothing about Ultima IV (that I can think of) that would be absurd in an elaborated novel or film. Hence, it's a good CRPG.Now try this with the original Ultima. Make a backstory for your elf, dwarf, human, or hobbit. Describe his slow rise in power and his accumulation of weapons and armor. Somehow introduce an air car with lasers. Figure out how you can plausibly get him into a spaceship so he can shoot down tie fighters and become a \"space ace.\" Determine a logical reason that he needs to explore dungeons to improve his health. Finally, think of a credible explanation for his slaughter of Lord British's jester and guards, just to get a key. I suppose there is a tortured way in which all of this could be done, but I'll bet Ebert doesn't give it a thumbs-up.I think the comparison to writing a novel or screenplay is quite apt. After all, when you're role-playing, you're essentially constructing a narrative. It might only be for you, but in order to be any fun, it still has to hold together within the world that the game provides. Might & Magic mostly holds together; Ultima II doesn't (unless you can figure out how a person might sensibly walk from the tip of South America to Africa and back in the course of one lifetime). In The Bard's Tale, you can construct an elaborate external world for your characters if you want (you practically have to, to alleviate the boredom of repetition); Beyond Zork is fun but too goofy to actually role-play.Occasionally, you will be playing an otherwise good CRPG, but you will experience role-playing pangs over a nonsensical story element. We covered some of these in \"What Were They Thinking?\" Baldur's Gate II: My best friend is missing; why am I wasting time solving quests for innkeepers and druids? Why am I managing a production of \"the Turmish play\" at my own theater? Why am I not raising 20,000 gold and rushing immediately to her aid? Oblivion: the world is under attack from hell, I'm on a quest from the emperor, and yet I'm worried about getting promoted in the fighter's guild? But mostly these worlds are expansive enough that you can construct plausible external reasons for these inconsistencies; sometimes they even enrich the role-playing possibilities (I trust the thieves' guild less than the Cowled Wizards; Martin needs a really long time to study the Mysterium Xarxes). But in these early games, you'd have to use really tortured logic to explain why all the enemies come back to life when Werdna saves his progress (Wizardry IV) or why alien robots would keep codes to their own destruction on non-encrypted computers (2400 A.D.), and for these reasons I had trouble role-playing them. Apply all of this to our most recent games: Mission: Mainframe and NetHack. I dare you to write a book in which an evil computer takes over an office building and your protagonist spends decades trying to find its location while slaying office workers with rulers and file folders (oh, and every time he leaves a floor and returns, everything is in a different location). Such a book would be worth the Amazon.com comments. But there's nothing in NetHack that's patently absurd. On the contrary, it's various touches (monsters leave corpses, you're constantly battling hunger, rocks occasionally block your passage, you don't automatically know what magic items are when you find them), by being both plentiful and realistic, provide a bonanza of role-playing options.There are other factors, of course, that make NetHack good for role-playing. Randomization of the game world means that no two games will be the same. There are enough gameplay elements for you to hang a story on. (Akalabeth features a reasonably plausible game world, but there isn't enough stuff to tell a story with.) But the integrity of the game world is where it starts. Like the writers of Dungeons & Dragons modules, the developers created a coherent world, outlined a credible story, seeded it with various elements, and stepped back to let your character and those elements interact. Yes, the graphics and sound are nonexistent; yes, it is maddeningly difficult, but by god, you can role-play this one. I'm sorry that I assumed all roguelikes were cut from the same cloth. A roguelike can be a good CRPG."}, {"title": "NetHack: Five Adventurers, Five Fates", "date": "Tuesday, January 4, 2011", "text": "Getting killed by a dead foe takes a special kind of talent.Well, you were all right: NetHack is incredibly fun and addictive. It keeps revealing new facets to me, even on the early levels, every time I start a new character. And the character classes really do matter, unlike Mission: Mainframe or many other CRPGs--roguelike and non-roguelike--of the era. Are their abilities meant to be so mysterious, though? I suspect that resistances and attributes and such vary from class to class, but the guidebook doesn't have much to say about them.Anyway, I thought I'd embed some of the gameplay features among stories about five adventurers and their experiences in the Dungeons of Doom.1. Victoria the ValkyrieVictoria was the brashest member of a brash race--charging through dungeons and actively engaging dangers. She blew through Level 1 so fast that she left her dog behind. In the first room on Level 2, she swiped a scroll from the dungeon floor. If there was a part of her mind--even in the deepest recesses--that exercised caution, she didn't hear it. She boldly read the words on the scroll and was rewarded for her risk with the absolute coolest spell ever--the ability to eliminate any monster from the game [permanently, on all levels, I assume]. She thought briefly about dragons and basilisks before glancing at her sword and noting the scarring and pitting that had been done only moments before by an acid slug [they had reduced it from a +1 to a 0]. With a brief word, the slimy menaces existed no more.She would soon wish she had said \"orcs.\"On Level 3, she encountered legions of orcs, but she pushed through their incessant darts and hacked them up one by one. On the other side, she found the most glorious sight ever seen in a roguelike game:A store! If only shopkeepers would identify items, I'd be in heaven.She was momentarily baffled by the interface: you \"pick up\" objects to add them to your shopping list and then \"pay bill\" when you're ready to check out; until then, the shopkeeper blocks the door. You \"drop\" items to sell them. She was also baffled by the willingness of the owner to purchase corpses of slain orcs, but she wasn't complaining.\u00a0Seriously, what is he going to do with this?She purchased some food rations and a mysterious brass ring (to go with the Ring of Protection +1 she'd found earlier and identified with a scroll). Among the piles of orc bodies, she had discovered a suit of ring mail +8--not bad for Level 3.Alas, her brashness was her undoing. Coming across another scroll, she read it aloud and was told by a mysterious voice that she was being punished for misbehavior. She found an iron ball shackled to her leg; she could pick it up but otherwise not get rid of it [seriously: is there any way?].If the game would let you name the ball \"Irene,\" NetHack would be awfully true to life.Her despondence grew to annoyance when her stomach started growling for the umpteenth time. Eyeing her rations--which included pizza and an egg--she decided to save her food and defy the universe with the unthinkable. She stripped the armor and clothing off a slain hobgoblin, roasted it over an open flame, and sank her teeth into its flesh. It did not agree with her. She died clutching her stomach and cursing the names of her Norse gods.That's putting it mildly.2. Grey Star the WizardGrey Star began with a pile of magic items: spellbooks with create familiar, force bolt, and sleep; scrolls of teleportation, light, and remove curse; a potion of invisiblity; rings of conflict and stealth; and wands of polymorph and \"nothing.\" Only the \"Ring of Conflict\" and the \"Wand of Nothing\" were real mysteries. In the first room, he found a second Scroll of Remove Curse and a pile of rocks for throwing. He quickly transcribed the spells in the spellbooks to his memory. Encountering a floating eye upon leaving the room, he tested out force bolt but was told he \"goofed up\" and then his measly 2 magic points were gone. He had to defeat the floating eye with his dagger like a common warrior. [At least the spell points regenerate fast.] The spell served him well in the next room, though, on a hobgoblin, and he kept using it on other foes until a message warned him that the spell \"was starting to look well-used\" [do spells run out in this game?] Things were nonetheless looking good for Grey Star until his stomach began to growl and he realized he didn't have any food. In desperation, he ate the corpse of an acid blob, but it just made him sick. Growing weaker by the moment, he fainted in front of a jackal and died at the wild canine's canines.3. Kurosawa the NinjaKurosawa left his distant clan and journeyed thousands of miles to the Dungeons of Doom, which explains why he didn't have any food when he got there [thanks, NetHack--most of my deaths are turning out to be food-related.] He did have a katana, 39 shurikens, leather armor, and a blindfold [??] along with, of course, his dog. On Level 1, he found some magic items that he dared not identify, and a fountain which, upon drinking the waters, dried up and revealed a gem. Unfortunately, an acid slug corroded his katana to the point of near unusability, and on Level 2 he was slain by an orc.4. Malory the KnightSir Malory heard about the deaths of the ninja, valkyrie, and wizard and couldn't help but laugh. Exploring the depths of dungeons was knight's work (and, incidentally, he thought, man's work). Equipped with a spear, long sword, ring mail, helmet, gloves, and shield, he vowed to hack and slash his way through any enemy the dungeon dared throw at him. He bullied his way through Level 1 and on Level 2 found a message written in the dust that read \"ad ae?a? um\" [seriously: what?]. On Level 3, he encountered narrow passages that his bulk of armor would not allow him to traverse. Not to be defeated by such annoyances, he stripped his armor and left it in a pile so as to wiggle his way through a tight crevice. On the other side, he found a giant ant and, having no protection, was slain.Is it a cryptogram?5. Paul the PriestPaul descended into the Dungeons of Doom convinced that his predecessors had lacked something crucial: faith. Armed with a blessed mace, chain mail, a shield, four vials of holy water, and spells of healing and detect food, he found himself in a dungeon room with an oddity: a kitchen sink. After quite a bit of fumbling about, he couldn't figure out what to do with it and moved on. True to his class, his foray into the dungeons did seem unusually blessed: he found a plethora of food, gold, and gems on the first two levels and defeated most enemies easily, rising quickly to Level 5. On Level 3, he found an armor shop and bought an Elven cloak.Yea, my god is a merciful god.Nonetheless, even the priest began to feel the ravages of hunger over time--hunger that was not sated by two of his rations, which turned out to be spoiled. On Level 4, he grew weak and started to faint. Clued by the game manual, he PRAYED and was rewarded by a full stomach! On Level 5, he found the same weird message that Malory had found along with a nymph who kept seducing him and stealing his armor before he finally tracked her down and killed her with some darts he had picked up from dead orcs. Hello? Fourth Amendment?   Then something utterly weird happened. Paul was running out of inventory room, so he took a chance reading a scroll. It turned out to be a mapping scroll and showed him a room in the upper-right corner of the map that he couldn't reach. Wandering around to try to get to it, he found himself suddenly teleported there from a dead-end passage. The room was full of gold! More than 1,400. Momentarily forgetting his vows, Paul scooped it up greedily. But he couldn't get out of the vault. As he futilely searched for an exit, a guard appeared and claimed that probably all his gold (including the 750 he already had) had been stolen from the vault and he'd best turn it over. Paul dropped the gold and the guard led him out. As he contemplated his empty pockets, he thanked his gods for teaching him a valuable lesson about greed.This is exactly how Mickey Mouse got into trouble.But Paul had another lesson to learn. On Level 6, he began to feel the weight of his inventory, so he thought he'd try a few potions and scrolls to lighten the load. One potion \"confused\" him, and he probably should have stopped messing around until his head cleared. Instead, he read a scroll that turned out to be a \"scroll of create monster.\" Because he was confused, he \"mispronounced the words\" and found himself surrounded by homunculuses. But when the battle cleared, he had two new rings and a potion, so everything turned out better than expected.As I head to bed for the night, Paul the Priest is on Level 6, is Level 7 himself, and has a big complement of unidentified magic items. He is doubtless my most successful hero so far. It's going to be painful when I (inevitably) lose him. I'll have to try to force myself to play a little Le Maitre des Ames tomorrow, or I'll just end up with this all day."}, {"title": "Game 38: NetHack (1987)", "date": "Monday, January 3, 2011", "text": "Again with the Amulet of YendorPlaying NetHack almost a year after I started this blog feels like coming full circle. Exactly one year ago, although I hadn't thought about blogging yet, I was deep in the throes of Rogue, probably on my 50th or 60th character, wondering why I was still playing the game and yet--for some impenetrable psychological reason probably rooted in my relationship with my father--I was still playing.I'm not spending four months on this one, but I'll spend at least long enough to learn how it's different from Rogue, since I keep hearing all kinds of promising things about it. So here's how we're going to do this: the NetHack wiki has a nice summary history of the different versions in the series. My general policy has been to play the latest version of the game; hence, my 1985 version of Rogue despite its original 1980 release date. The latest NetHack release, however, is from 2003, which seems a little unfair to the spirit of the blog.The Wiki divides NetHack into several \"series\": \"early NetHack\" and then separate series for versions 3.0 (1989), 3.1 (1993), 3.2 (1996), 3.3 (1999), and 3.4 (2002). Since each update adds a lot of material to the game, I'm going to regard each \"series\" as a separate game and dip back into NetHack every few years to see what's new. But when I do, I'll play the last version of that \"series.\" This means that for my first NetHack outing, I'll be playing version 2.3e, released in April 1988 but still close enough to the 1987 version that I don't feel like I'm jumping the queue. I got the compiled version from an FTP site that was kindly sent to me by Ryan (\"Pipecleaner Productions\") Jones. It took some work editing the configuration so that it would run in DOSBox, but I think I finally got it. So with all of that out of the way, let's get into the game. The back story, such as it is, is that you've just graduated from the local adventurer's guild, and now you have to retrieve the Amulet of Yendor from the Dungeons of Doom in order to achieve full membership. While you're at it, you're also trying to grab as much gold as you can.In a notable departure from Rogue, your character is not a rogue. Instead, you select from a list of (in this edition) 12 character classes, some of them standard CRPG fare (barbarian, knight, priest, elf, wizard), some a little more exotic (ninja, valkyrie, healer), and some very odd (archaeologist, tourist, caveman). The choice of character class affects your starting statistics and equipment; I don't know if it affects anything else later in the game. If you choose \"tourist\"--I just had to--your starting equipment includes a Hawaiian shirt and a camera(!).\"This doesn't look like the brochure.\"For those readers unfamiliar with \"roguelike\" games at all, I would refer you to my original review of Rogue to get a sense of the unique challenges and conventions. Suffice to say that they're all present here: permanent death, dungeons that slowly reveal themselves as you explore, constantly-respawning monsters, unidentified (and often unidentifiable) magic items, turn-based movement, and hunger. Your only stats, just as in Rogue, are hit points, armor class, and strength, and your hit points slowly regenerate as you move around. However, already NetHack has introduced lots of new elements:When you start the game, you have a dog. God knows why. It does help a little by attacking monsters. The help file suggests that you can train the dog to \"do all sorts of things,\" but I have no idea how. I've noticed the dog has a habit of wandering off and \"fetching\" items from other rooms.When monsters die, they leave bodies, which you can pick up and carry around. At first, I couldn't figure out why you'd want to do that, but I soon realized it was possible to eat them--yuck, but I hope this means food isn't quite the problem it was in Rogue. I also note that if you don't pick up a body, your dog generally eats it.You have to wonder: who's the real monster here?There seem to be a lot more secret doors in this version, and they're no quicker to reveal themselves than in Rogue. You have to hold down the (s)earch key for a while. Occasionally, rocks block the passageway. You can try to move them, but only so far. There are a lot more game features listed in the help file (I haven't found most of them yet), including pools of water, fountains, and thrones (homage to Telengard?) along with the usual weapons, armor, potions, scrolls, and gold. You can name monsters and items, just as in Beyond Zork. We were just talking about this (see comments). Your character's name is hard-coded in the configuration file, at least in this version. You can go back up to previous levels at any time, not just when you have the Amulet of Yendor. When you die, the game offers to identify your possessions so you know how much cool stuff you were unknowingly toting about. I understand that serious NetHackers use DYWYPI (\"Do you want your possessions identified?\") as a codeword for death (\"then I came across a floating eye, and before I knew it, DYWYPI\").I don't know why it's not \"DYWTHYPI.\" Probably a version thing.When Chet the Tourist began his adventure, he was so laden with stuff--including a lot of food and, for some reason, a dead lizard--he couldn't even pick up the first scroll he came across. Almost immediately, he accidentally destroyed his camera by trying to use it as a melee weapon against an acid blob, but he finally finished off the creature with some darts. A few minutes later, he ran into a hobgoblin and DYWYPI.Note that NetHack didn't suffer from a Y2K bug.Shortly on his heels was Chet the Caveman, who upon entry immediately found himself and his dog in battle against a floating eye, to which he gave a \"caveman\" style name. While he was taking time to name the floating eye, it was killed by his dog, and then eaten.That's some serious role-playing there.In swift order, Chet killed a gnome and a jackal with a combination of his club and arrows, and he managed to hoist the jackal's body over his shoulders before his mangy mutt could get to it. He found a fountain and drank from it, but to uncertain effect. The dog disappeared for a while and came back with a scroll labeled LEP GEX VEN ZEA, which Chet--being somewhat dumb--couldn't stop himself from reading. The game asked rhetorically \"Who was that Maude person anyway?\" and the game map disappeared; it was apparently a scroll of forgetting--could have been worse. An acid blob came along and corroded his club so that instead of a +1 it was a -1. He killed a rat and found a blue gem. Things seemed to be going well for Chet, but the fates played a cruel joke: his god had neglected to set the configuration settings in his universe properly, and he could not save his progress. He died a death of ignominy.Bruce the Barbarian began bewildered, descending the stairs to find a room with no exits, but ultimately a secret door revealed itself. He found a fountain, too, but instead of refreshing him it spewed forth a trio of snakes. When he had explored every crevice of the level, he beat his mighty barbarian fists against the walls, knowing that he was missing secret doors but unable to find them. Despondent, he descended to Level 2--but not before gnashing his barbarian teeth into the corpse of a jackal and getting what should have been in hindsight an entirely predictable result.The USDA needs to do something about substandard jackal meat.The result of the bad food made Bruce woozy, and while stumbling about, he accidentally killed his dog. Shortly thereafter, on Level 3, he fainted from hunger and was killed by the joint assault of a gnome and a bat.Time for Victoria the Valkyrie to make a name for herself.Okay, so having played for a little while, these are my questions. I don't want to look up the answers online because I'm afraid of finding other major spoilers, but I'd appreciate your answers if it won't ruin the gameplay experience for me to know this soon:What are gems for?Why is there a command called \"pay bill\"? Dare I hope there are places to spend my gold in this game, unlike Rogue?As we've seen, the player can accidentally kill the dog. Can monsters? (It hasn't happened yet.) If they do, can you get another one?Is there a way to permanently deal with the boulders?In the lower right-hand corner, next to the number of moves in the game so far, is a value preceded by an \"S\" (e.g., \"S:440\"). It went up when I drank from a fountain, but I otherwise have no idea what it is.Does the choice of character class have role-playing ramifications later? Or does it just matter at the beginning?Of course, the real question is: Why am I up at four o'clock in the morning still playing this game?! The answer, of course, is in the title of my blog. If no one before has said that this game ought to be called NetCrack, consider me the first."}, {"title": "Mission: Mainframe: Won!*", "date": "Monday, January 3, 2011", "text": "This screen--and this screen only--is what awaits you at the end of hundreds of hours of gameplay\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mission: MainframeUnited StatesIndependently developed and released as sharewareReleased in 1987 for DOSDate Started: 31 December 2010Date Ended: 2 January 2011Total Hours: 10Difficulty: Hard (4.0/5)Final Rating: 25Ranking at Game #404: 179/404 (44%)\u00a0So, Mission: Mainframe wasn't all that hard, it turns out. Anyone who struggles with it is, quite frankly, a roguelike noob. It just requires a little bit of persistence, a lot of skill, and maybe some...yeah, okay, I cheated. Cheated big-time.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I had pretty much decided after the last M:M posting that I wasn't going to play any more, but it bugged me a bit, and I figured I'd at least like to see what the game offered at higher levels. So I committed what I thought was a mild sort of cheat: I backed up my save game file so that permanent death wouldn't be permanent. With this done, I was free to take greater risks, starting with descending directly to Level 10 and picking up the security key that would allow me to access Levels 11-20. Then, after a couple hours of that, I went right down to Level 20 and got the security clearance that would get me to Levels 21-30. Thinking that I could just end things once and for all, I sneaked around Level 30 until I found the \"Executive Meeting\" consisting of a bunch of high-level office workers (executives, directors, attorneys, and the like), culminating in The Operator--the big boss. I could trick and evade the others, but there was no getting around The Operator, and he thoroughly thrashed me.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Still--not a big deal. I knew where the big boss was; I just needed to build up my character enough to defeat him. I ran around collecting gold and valuable office supplies (scissors were the best I found, offering 100 each to offense and defense), finding potions that raised my stats, spending money on \"strategies\" (which turned out to be mostly useless) and health club sessions to boost my stats further, getting experience and rising levels, and so on.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And this, my friends, is when I started to remember why we don't allow save game backups in roguelikes. Sure, you start out by saying, \"I'll just use it when my character dies.\" But these being roguelikes, your character dies a lot, and suddenly that backup file seems a little too handy. Accidentally swap out a good weapon with a so-so weapon? Restore the backup! Attorney destroys one of your supplies (which they do, the bastards)? Restore the backup! Manger or supervisor knocks down some of your stats? Restore the backup! Don't like the attribute score increase that you got on your last visit to the gym? Restore the backup! Etc. etc. etc. And of course, the backups change the entire dynamic. Suddenly, shooting directly to Floor 30 isn't a risk--hell, that's where the best stuff is! There's no point in avoiding risk when you have a fail-safe! Backing up your save game file doesn't just save you from permanent death--it breaks the entire purpose of roguelike games.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And yet, not even this amount of cheating was enough. I did it for about maybe six hours of gameplay time (although, to be fair, I was multitasking), and I still couldn't improve my character enough to defeat The Operator. So I resulted to way worse cheating:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 If you don't know what this is, I'm proud of you.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 That's right: I downloaded a hex editor and modified my save game file. But I even screwed that up, since I don't really understand hexidecimal code. I meant to change all my attributes to 999, but somehow I ended up changing three to 14,649 and three to 57. Since the 14,649s included my strength and dexterity, though, it didn't matter: The Operator couldn't hit me as I devastated him with scissors, coffee, and a rubber band.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I defeated the controller of an evil computer with a hex editor. That's called \"fire with fire,\" my friends.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Let's be clear: there is no way I would have ever won this game playing it \"straight.\" Not in four months, like I did with Rogue; not in four years. Even cheating, I died constantly--from alcohol, darkness, traps, and enemies. I probably would have won, eventually, without the hex editor, but never without making backups. I would love to hear from a single person who has ever won this game without making backups of the save games. Tell me how you did it (you have to be convincing), and I'll send you $100 [Note: someone got it much quicker than I would have imagined; see comments].\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 But it doesn't really count as a \"win\"; hence, the asterisk in the title. And I won't list it as such in my ranking spreadsheet.\u00a0 \u00a0 Speaking of rankings, here we go. Does it make sense to rank roguelikes on the GIMLET scale? Probably not. But I'll bet it reflects my actual enjoyment of the game.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 1. Game World. Roguelikes are not known for their attention to the back story and game world. This one is no exception. It offers a paper-thin plot as an excuse to transform Wizard's Castle to an office building, but all of the adaptations--a gym instead of a training hall, a supply cabinet instead of a weapons shop, \"strategies\" instead of spells--seem goofy and forced. Score: 2.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 2. Character Creation and Development. The character creation system has you pick from four classes--commando, detective, secret agent, and private eye--but these don't even do what they say they'll do (adjust your ability scores), let alone anything else. Development in terms of increasing attributes is quasi-satisfying since it happens so rarely. I have no idea what leveling does for you--it doesn't increase your hit points or anything. Score: 2.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 3. NPC Interaction: There are no NPCs. Score: 0.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 4. Encounters and Foes. Some of these are cute, I'll give it that. Instead of the standard menagerie of orcs, hobgoblins, trolls, and such, you fight secretaries, consultants, analysts, and vice presidents. Most of them do something unique--steal your money, destroy your food, destroy your equipment, damage your ability scores, teleport you, and so on--and you need to learn these things to determine which to fight and which to trick or flee. There's no way to \"role play\" any of this of course, but all levels respawn when you leave them, so there's no shortage of experience. Score: 4.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If my secretary could teleport people out of the office, I'd be a happy man.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5. Magic and Combat. \"Magic\" consists of \"strategies\" that you have to buy--analyze, bluff, confuse, decoy, flatter, and hypnotize. They increase in price in that order, and \"hypnotize\" is so expensive I never got it. The strategies seem to work about as often as \"trick,\" which you pay nothing for. Combat is very basic--just hit the \"B\" key--and since you can't flee or avoid encounters, there's really no strategy to it. Score: 2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 6. Equipment. Like the game world, the use of rulers, erasers, bookends, and such as offensive and defensive items is mildly amusing at first, but ultimately seems stupid and forced. Plus, the thought of killing secretaries with paperclips doesn't encourage you to suspend disbelief and immerse yourself in the game world. There is a shop, and it's easy to tell which pieces of equipment are best. Score: 3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Did I mention that you kill people with stamps, file folders, and credit cards?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 7. Economy. You collect money throughout the game, and since you can use it to increase your attributes, there's never any reason to stop. That's about the best I can say for it. I wish the office supply cabinet got better things as I rose in levels; instead, it only ever offered the selection of starting equipment. Score: 4.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 8. Quests. Only one main quest, and pretty lame at that, and no side quests. I know that almost all roguelikes just feature one thin main quest, but I like quests in CRPGs. If that means I rank all roguelikes slightly low, so be it. Score: 1.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 9. Graphics, Sound, Inputs. The graphics aren't going to fool you into thinking that you're really in an office building, but they're good enough for a roguelike, which after all doesn't depend on graphics. There is some decent sound, sparingly used, and the controls are fairly easy to master. Score: 5.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 10. Gameplay. I suppose this is the most subjective category. I like games that are challenging but not impossible; Mission: Mainframe strikes me as impossible. Unlike some roguelikes, it's really not replayable--the \"classes\" offer the same experience--there's no real opportunity for role playing (especially since the game world is so goofy). At least things move along pretty fast. Score: 2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Final Score: 25. That puts it lower than everything except Ultima II and the original Rogue, and frankly I think I gave Rogue a raw deal (the GIMLET scale was new back then). It ranks higher than Rogue only because it has an economy and the encounters are a little more interesting. If you like traditional roguelikes, you'll likely disagree with this assessment, but I wouldn't be upset if this was the last one I played.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 With those words, I ought to return to Le Maitre des Ames, but NetHack is next, and I'd like to be able to compare the latter to Mission: Mainframe while it's still fresh in my mind. I've just downloaded version 2.3e, and I think I'll check it out for a few minutes before I go to bed."}, {"title": "Le Maitre des Ames: De Retour au Ch\u00e2teau", "date": "Sunday, January 2, 2011", "text": "\"Together we shall vanquish the evil. I am swearing.\"Le Maitre des Ames continues to offer up interesting gameplay elements and tantalizing clues. Wandering the halls, amidst slaying orcs, mushroom people, and rats, I managed to pick up an NPC, learn from a disembodied spirit that looks like a bee that someone named Baldigorn holds the key to victory, and to learn from a sign that to kill someone (presumably the big lizard an orc told me about), I need to protect myself from his claws. Okay, is he saying he's a spirit enslaved to Kharam, or that he is Kharam's spirit?As I mentioned in my last Maitre posting, reader Eugene Hung was kind enough to refer my translation request to a friend of his, Julien Van Reeth. Julien kindly translated the entire manual for me, clearing up much of my confusion about the game--particularly how to cast spells. Thanks a lot, guys!There are still a couple of mysteries to the game: I've found items that look like potions but for the life of me I can't figure out how to use them, and I don't know how or if my accumulated experience translates to levels. When I create a party, my characters don't seem to keep the same statistics that I originally rolled (maybe this is a bug instead of something I'm confused about).I take it \"miam!\" means \"yum!\"The manual tells you how to eat, but it isn't very helpful as to the question of when to eat. Each of my characters has a \"hunger\" (faim) score, but I can't tell what it means. Sometimes when I eat it goes down, sometimes it goes up. So does a high faim score mean you're hungry or full?As I continue to play, I'm realizing how futile it is to map the castle. First, the game gives you no indication--no stairs, no ladder, nothing--when you go \"down\" or \"up\" a level. You just go through a door that ought not to be there and wind up in a place that's impossible on your existing map, so you figure you've gone up or down. On Level 2, meanwhile, I ran into a series of rooms with signs next to the doors that read \"Those who enter here never come out.\" Prophetically, all the doors seem to double back on themselves, locking you in a series of about six rooms. It took me a while to find the right door would get me out.One of the game's more annoying features is that you can only equip two items at the same time, and yet the game offers three basic items: weapons, armor, and shields. I guess the shields are a bit superfluous. But that pales in comparison to a maddening interface element. When you click on your characters to see their stats or inventory, instead of briskly popping up the relevant screen, the game runs through a tiresome on-screen animation. It only takes a few seconds, but those seconds add up and get on my nerves.On the plus side, dying offers one of the more memorable on-screen graphics of any game:My characters deaths have doomed the whole world!I know I've been going a bit nuts with videos lately, but DOSBox just makes it so damned easy. The brief video below shows the process of several combats, finding hidden doors, reading signs, picking up items, and using keys. I used YouTube's commenting features for the first time to add some commentary and translation to the action. When I get a chance, I'll explore video editing software that will also allow me to add audio commentary (suggestions welcome).While I continue to like this game and think that it has promise, I don't look terribly forward to my gameplay sessions. First, the process of constantly translating is a little tiresome--why do the French games have to be the wordiest games? (If Mission: Mainframe was in French, it would hardly be any different.) (And yes, I know how lame that complaint must seem to those of you who said you learned English from CRPGS; by the way, Rizla, where did you go?) Second, the overall uncertainty the game leaves me with respect to items, food, and leveling makes it hard to just sit back and enjoy it.I figure I'll keep playing at least until I encounter this giant reptile that the NPCs keep going on about--I'm guessing it's the \"big boss\" of the first part of the game or something. Then I'll reassess.In the meantime, if anyone knows of any Spanish CPRGs, do let me know. I'm going to Argentina in a few months on business, and I really need to start brushing up.*****Notes from 12 November 2017: For some reason, I abandoned Le M\u00e2itre des \u00c2mes after this entry, but I picked it up again seven years later and completed up. Read the updated coverage."}, {"title": "Mission: Mainframe: Megacorp Madness", "date": "Saturday, January 1, 2011", "text": "I actually am! HOW DOES THE GAME KNOW?!I ascend in the elevator to Floor 2. I walk three rooms north and find 41 bytes (gold). I meet a janitor and trick him into leaving the room, allowing me access to the file cabinet. I break it open and find 188 bytes and a beverage. I sip the beverage and am informed that it \"tastes delicious\" so I drink the whole thing. It turns out to be a double martini, and suddenly my character is drunk, meaning that none of the directional keys work and I stumble from room to room. I run into a secretary. I try to trick her but it fails and she attacks me. I fight, but suddenly she teleports me to a different level (I don't know why secretaries can do this). I stumble across two rooms, picking up some bytes. Suddenly the power goes out, so I'm both drunk and in the dark. I mash keys randomly, hoping to find my way to the elevator. I'm sucked up an air shaft and deposited on Floor 8. I run into someone in the dark. I try to trick him. It fails and he attacks. I try to evade but I slip and fall. He steals all the bytes I have accumulated, then kills me. The game tells me I have been slain by an accountant.This is a pretty typical game. I've cycled through probably 30 characters in Mission: Mainframe. I tried to get clever at the beginning. I was Bond the Spy and Matrix the Commando and whatnot, but it got old fast so I've just stuck with Marlowe the Private Eye. Over and over. I warned you that there wouldn't be many new things I could say about the game after the first posting, but here are a few that I've discovered.The vending machine, where you can buy food, can \"eat your money.\" Nice touch of realism.You can carry up to six office supplies at once, including stamps, newspapers, pens, pencils, out baskets, in baskets, credit cards, and rulers. Each gives a different bonus to offense, defense, or both. But there are also some \"cursed\" items, like red ink and leaky pens, that damage your stats. You have to pay big bucks to \"sell\" them to the office supply cabinet and get rid of them.I am killing secretaries and file clerks with pencils and stamps. This is the most disgusting game I've ever played.Your character ages. My current character, who I've gotten all the way up to Level 4, is now 21. I started at 18. Putting aside the absurdity of the idea that I've been exploring this office building for three years, I wonder if this means the game has a time limit: do I eventually get too old and die?Floors reset when you leave them, and each time it's a random combination of encounters and treasures. I've yet to complete an entire floor because I always get sucked up an air vent or teleported by a secretary, or I nearly die and have to limp back to the elevator and return to the lobby. Somewhere I need to find a key that will get me past Floor 10, but that's not likely to be a pressing problem any time soon.If the power goes out, you can light a match (if you've found any) or find the fuse box (there's one on each level) or just stumble around until you find the elevator.When you find new items, the game gives you the opportunity to test them out before committing. You can \"analyze\" items, \"sip\" beverages, and \"inspect\" file cabinets. The game is remarkably straightforward with its clues from these actions, and I find it difficult to drink the wrong thing or pick up any more red ink. Level 1 character: Killer the Commando. Descends to Floor 2, immediately finding some stamps (TK). Encounters a secretary but evades her. Finds 90 bytes in the next room. Finds the level's fuse box. Meets an accountant who steals 61 of the bytes and does 50 damage before Killer successfully evades. Sucked up a shaft to Floor 4. Breaks open a file cabinet for 634 bytes. Runs into a room that automatically heals all his hit points. Another file cabinet. Meets an ANALYST. Tries to trick him, unsuccessfully. Killed in two rounds.Technically, I should point out that when you die in the game, you have the option to hit ESC and try to get resurrected. If it works, you lose all your items, food, strategies, and money, but you get to keep your experience and statistics. It still doesn't sound so bad, but the option only works about 25% of the time, and I've never had it work on the same character twice. Usually, I get this:It's like losing twice.Unlike Rogue, your constant need for food doesn't impel you to go further and further down into the dungeon whether you're ready or not. As I've been wary about going too far too fast, I've been lurking around Floors 1-3, trying to build up my character. I am worried about the age aspect, though, so I suppose I'd better get moving.In general, roguelikes do not reward risk. Compare this with a game like Dungeon Master. In that game, even though I stuck to rules about saving and re-loading, and dying wasn't a walk in the park, I still took occasional risks. When I first encountered Chaos, I threw myself at him. Why not? He slaughtered me mercilessly, but I might have won the game right there. It's happened before.In Mission: Mainframe, on the other hand--just as in Rogue--losing that gamble doesn't just mean you have to reload; it means you have to start over at Level 1 with a brand new character. That's a sobering risk. Thus, the only way to progress is to play it very safe, to keep wandering early levels to build up your character. Even then, you're not guaranteed anything. The longer you play, the greater your odds of getting drunk, or getting lost in the dark, or teleported to a level you can't handle.I know this all sounds negative, just like my review of Rogue, but despite how frustrating the game is, it's also insufferably addicting. I keep dying, and I keep creating new characters. Long past the point at which it would have made more sense to be doing something else.I'm back home now, though, with my second monitor and a stable Internet connection, so I think it's rather time to throw myself back into Le Maitre des Ames. I don't know if I'll have another posting on Mission: Mainframe or not. I certainly don't expect a \"Won!\" posting--honestly, has anyone ever won this game without cheating? Although I did with Rogue, it took me four months, and this game is harder than Rogue.On another note, I finally got around to doing what some of you had been encouraging for almost a year, since Ultima II: see Time Bandits. The film is quite possibly--and I say this with great affection--the dumbest movie I've ever seen. But its influence on Ultima II in terms of the cloth map, time travel, and the dimension doors is quite obvious, and I'm glad I saw it for that reason. More important, David Warner did a fantastic job in an early example of what ought to forever be called \"the David Warner role.\" Between Time Bandits, Tron, Time After Time, Gargoyles, Star Trek: TNG, and of course Baldur's Gate II, he really has mastered the part of the pontificating, pseudo-intellectual, vaguely absurd arch villain."}, {"title": "Game 37: Mission: Mainframe (1987)", "date": "Friday, December 31, 2010", "text": "Mission: MainframeUnited StatesIndependently developed and released as sharewareReleased in 1987 for DOSDate Started: 31 December 2010\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, first off: I'm still not done with Le Maitre des Ames, especially now that I have a translated manual. But this hotel has the worst Internet connection I've experienced in a long time, and I keep losing my access to Google translate (which I still need for the in-game text). I'm writing this blog entry in Notepad on Thursday, but I can't imagine I'll be able to post it until I get home Friday night. Second, I really need my second monitor to effectively play Maitre, what with the need to have the game, my notepad, the manual, my map, and the translation screen all open at the same time.So I'm moving on temporarily to Mission: Mainframe, a roguelike that MobyGames lists as a 1987 offering, but whose own title screen shows that the first version was from 1983. I had heard that it was a roguelike, so I was basically expecting Rogue in a futuristic setting, so I wasn't prepared for all of the variations that this game includes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Was just a wrecking ball out of the question?The backstory is that a malevolent computer mainframe has taken over an office building, corrupting employees and causing all kinds of havoc. You must ascend up to 30 floors of the office building (i.e., dungeon levels) to find the computer (i.e., Amulet of Yendor) and return with knowledge of its location to the lobby. On the way, you must deal with hostile employees (monsters), keep up a supply of junk food, increase your levels and statistics, find office supplies (weapons), learn different strategies for dealing with different employees, and collect chips and bytes (gold).You would think the programmers of this game would know that bytes are not actual objects.The game offers a very long, detailed tutorial instead of a physical manual, which is unusual for the era (you also have the option to print out the tutorial). Character creation is a process of choosing a name and class (commando, secret agent, detective, or private eye) and then rolling some random stats until you get the ones you like. Supposedly the classes offer stat bonuses (e.g., commandos get extra strength and stamina), but the values seemed random to me, no matter what class I chose. I don't think any state licenses private investigators as young as 18.You start off in the building's lobby (i.e., town), where you can purchase from a variety of odd weapons (pencil, pen, paperclips, file folder), fill up your food supplies, go to the gym to increase your stats, visit the library to purchase strategies for dealing with employees, and get healed. Of course, all of these things cost money. The lobby is also the only place to save your character. In the tradition of Rogue, you can only save for later play; death is permanent and your save game is deleted when you die.Trapped file cabinets? There ought to be a \"call OSHA\" option.Moving around the game world is reminiscent of Wizard's Castle, which I reviewed back in July. Each floor contains 64 rooms (8 x 8) in which you might find employees, file cabinets with money, potions (the game doesn't even try to come up with a modern analog for that), and other objects. You might also get sucked up a computer-controlled air vent and delivered to another floor. The lights might abruptly go out. And so on. The level of detail that you see ahead of time depends on the difficulty level that you choose at the start of the game.When you encounter employees, you have a number of options for dealing with them: you can try to (d)eal or trade, (b)attle them, employ a (s)trategy that you've learned from the library, (t)rick them, (e)vade them, or make a prank (p)hone call to distract them. These various moves have a chance of success or failure based on the type of employee (accountant, janitor, secretary, file clerk, etc.) and your statistics. If it comes to battle, the employees are mercilessly lethal. (The first time I read, \"You have been done in by a SECRETARY!\" was a bit of a downer.) No matter what you do, success rewards you with experience points towards another level.I imagine it goes without saying that you die lots and lots in Mission: Mainframe, just like any other roguelike. I haven't been able to keep a character alive more than about 15 minutes. Death wipes out your character and your saved game and forces you to start completely over. Lots of people find this fun, apparently.The video above shows a few minutes of gameplay, so you can get a sense of the different types of encounters and such (it's hard to read on the size of this screen, though; you might want to go directly to the YouTube site). I managed to make it without dying, but just barely.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I was curious about the developers, Brian J. Shankman and Jerry M. Plemons, who want me to send them $15 if I enjoy it. Shankman has a LinkedIn profile; he apparently used to work for Sabre, the company that owns Travelocity. He mentions the game in his profile. Plemons now owns a photography studio. LinkedIn wants me to upgrade my account to contact Shankman, and I otherwise can't find an address for him, but I have Plemons's studio address, so I'm going to send him the $15. I wrote a book about 15 years ago and it's always a thrill when I get a tiny royalty check; I hope Plemons feels the same way.Now, here's the difficultly. To paraphrase a quote from Roger Ebert: this posting is like a piece of cheese. Now that you've read it, you know everything there is to know about that cheese except what it would be like to eat an entire block. If I play this game all the way to the end, what am I going to blog about that I haven't already told you? Roguelikes don't reveal new bits of story as you play. They don't offer NPCs. They don't do anything different than you see in that brief video except get harder. And the last (only) one that I won, Rogue, took me four months. These are important questions, because Nethack is coming up right after this (well, after Le Maitre des Ames anyway). I figure my options are:Don't blog for weeks until I win Blog what I'm doing, no matter how repetitive or boringCome up with a lot of special topics postings as I playPlay roguelikes side-by-side with non-roguelikes, only blog about the latter until something interesting happens or I winJust do one or two postings on the roguelikes and move onSince I still have Le Maitre des Ames on the burner anyway, I think I'll try #4 and see how it goes."}, {"title": "Legacy of the Ancients: Won!", "date": "Wednesday, December 29, 2010", "text": "\"Knowing nothing of the planet?\" Did the game forget its own backstory? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Well, it took longer than I thought, but not in any meaningful way did it take \"long.\" Much of my time was spent screwing around trying to find coins so I could view all the Museum exhibits. I'm not sure I explained this very clearly before. In the Museum are a number of digital \"exhibits,\" each of which takes a certain type of coin--jade, topaz, amethyst, sapphire, and so on. Each exhibit tells you something about the game world, and some of them give you objects or money, transport you to various adventures, or give you a quest. Viewing all of them was crucial to advancing. Some coins I had to find in specific places, like chests in the castle, and others I bought from random merchants.It turned out I had to return to Castle Kelfor about 9 times, fighting legions of guards each time. Each visit got me some clue or object that I needed to use somewhere else to get me another clue or object that allowed me to penetrate deeper into the castle. I discovered belatedly that some seeds I found on my first visit turn me invisible and would have saved me a lot of fighting.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I never could have guessed that password.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The ultimate result of Kelfor was to find a mysterious old wizard called the Guardian who branded me so that members of the resistance would be able to identify me. This did exactly one thing for me: it allowed a healer to give me a ruby coin. It took me about 90 minutes to find the healer, visiting every single town in the game before I finally remembered there was a town out on the pirate islands I had forgotten about. That's where she was. Aaargh.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The ruby coin allowed me access to a special dungeon contained within the Museum, where I spelunked eight levels to find the four jewels that  would neutralize the Wizard's Compendium. This wasn't too much of a  challenge except that I accidentally quit without saving and had to go  through the whole process of getting the key the second time.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The dungeon, despite all the build-up, was actually quite easy.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I thought to video-capture it on the second run. The nine-minute clip below contains just about everything the game has to offer: towns, outdoors, outdoor combat, buying and selling things, the Museum exhibits, and a dungeon. Note the primitive sounds, which I neglected to mention before.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 After the dungeon, I flew on a pegasus across the sea to the Warlord's castle. It was a long trip, and one wonders how he's managing to terrorize the main continent from such a remote outpost, especially whereas I needed to thaw a frozen pegasus to get there.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The fortress was a bit of a challenge. The game forced me to get captured the moment I walked through the door and stripped me of my weapons and armor.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 This is always a tiresome device.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I escaped from jail by killing a guard, and I soon found an axe and some plate mail. I then had to hack my way through dozens of tough guards who were relatively impervious to spells.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Along the way were two cut scenes showing the Warlord taunting and threatening me. I finally caught up with him in this room where the Compendium itself kept attacking me, not only sapping my hit points but also destroying my healing herbs! Totally uncool. At long last, I killed the Warlord and was informed that the castle would self-destruct in five minutes.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 At this point, the game completely wore out its welcome. It took me way longer than five minutes to chop my way through the many guards remaining between me and the exit. This is bad gameplay design, don't you think? I mean, once you've killed the big boss, the game ought to be pretty much over.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 At length, I returned to the Museum and was given the Galactic Medal of Honor by the Caretaker. I also videoed the end, from the time the Warlord's fortress exploded to the last scene.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 It's quite long, first because I forgot where to find a certain exhibit and I spend a lot of time wandering around. Then the game insists on recapping the entire plot for about five minutes. Still, it's one of the few end-game victory cut scenes that we have in this era, and I suppose I ought to appreciate it. The final shot sets up a very obvious sequel:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This is already pretty long, but I think I'll figure out the GIMLET ranking right here instead of saving it for another posting. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1. Game World. You have to give it points for originality. Sure, the world itself is fairly standard fantasy fare, and the peasant-rises-up-to-defeat-the-evil-warlord has been done to death, but the framing device of the Galactic Museum is quite original. The problem is, I don't know how well it works. If the Museum is supposed to be a secret, why do the shops sell a spell that has no purpose except to take you to it? Why are the coins all over the place? The land itself is a bit mysterious--who is this Kelfor whose castle I keep raiding? Should I feel bad about killing all his guards? The bad balances the good. One good element is that as you get closer to the end, the Warlord's minions start raiding towns and killing healers (I forgot to mention this above); I like games in which the game world changes noticeably in response to the player's actions. Score: 6. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 2. Character Creation & Development. Very unsatisfying. \"Creation\" consists of just giving a name. There is no opportunity to role-play races, sexes, and classes. Leveling is all quest-based (and linear) and has nothing to do with the legions of monsters you slay. The only good points are the mini-games by which you develop dexterity, endurance, and intelligence. I spent over an hour on the intelligence mini-game, which consisted of a variation of Liar's Dice. Score: 3.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The intelligence-boosting mini-game called Stones of Wisdom was actually far more addicting than the main game.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 3. NPC Interaction. Ultima I-III-level stuff: you speak to them, they tell you one thing. No dialog options, no role-playing. If you count the Caretaker and seers as NPCs, though, it is necessary to speak to NPCs to learn about your quest and the game world. Score: 3. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 4. Encounters & Foes. No other game offers quite the catalog of creatures that Legacy of the Ancients offers, but the only real unique thing about them is their names. They don't really do anything special. The creatures respawn constantly, which I usually regard as a good thing--when killing creatures gets you experience. I suppose there is some very very minor \"role-playing\" in that you can choose to speak with some creatures instead of fighting them. Score: 3. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5. Magic & Combat. The magic system consists of six spells which you buy in units: two virtually identical blast spells, a \"befuddlement\" spell that stuns your foes (I never used it), a \"kill\" spell that clears out dungeon corridors, a strength spell, and a spell that takes you to the Museum. It couldn't be less imaginative. Combat is similarly unsatisfying; you just have one attack option. Yes, some creatures take more damage from certain weapon types, but by the time you've got that nailed down, you're strong enough that it hardly makes sense to bother swapping out equipment. Score: 2. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 6. Equipment. Weapons and armor are very basic, although the \"rating\" system is unusual, and the sale price makes it easy to tell which item is best. There is quite a lot of supplementary equipment that you can find and buy, from grappling hooks for climbing mountains to \"magic ice\" that allows you to cross small bodies of water. Nothing earth-shattering, but interesting. Score: 4.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 7. Economy. Late in the game, you have way more gold than you need, but for most of it, you're spending most of your cash on spells and herbs. I like the gambling mini-games, and I like that the \"break the bank\" bit makes it hard to get too rich playing. Score: 6.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a08. Quests. The game has essentially one quest, arranged in various stages or chapters. No side quests, no alternate outcomes, and no real role-playing. Score: 2. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 9. Graphics, Sound, and Inputs. The graphics are decent enough for an isometric game of the era, especially in the Apple II and C64 versions (which I didn't play). The sound is 8-bit throwback and a bit painful. It slows down the gameplay and I couldn't find any way to shut it off. Controls are through the keyboard and intuitive enough. Score: 4.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 10. Gameplay. The game is very linear from the outset. Although you can explore much of the world right away, you can't really do anything until you begin the main quest, and that proceeds in a lock-step order. There is no replayability to the game. The difficulty feels right, the pacing is okay, and the five mini-games (three stat-boosting, two gambling) are fun diversions. It's a short game, but I wouldn't want to play it for too long. Score: 5.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The final score of 38 puts it about on par with 2400 A.D., of which it reminds me a bit. Both of the games were short isometric outings in fairly limited and somewhat boring gameworlds despite interesting sci-fi framing plots.All right, it's well past time to do what I'm going to do with Le Maitre des Ames. After that, it's on to something called Mission: Mainframe."}, {"title": "Legacy of the Ancients: Mildly Amusing Curio", "date": "Tuesday, December 28, 2010", "text": "Apparently, intergalactic space travelers still wear cloaks and carry candles.Legacy of the Ancients is an okay game that moves along at a decent clip. I spent enough time playing today to get several entries out of it, if I wanted. My major accomplishments were to:Accumulate a lot of money through gambling and use it to buy magic itemsHave the Wizard's Compendium stolen (this doesn't sound like an accomplishment, but the game suggests it was necessary)Build up some of my character statsRaid Castle Kelfor for gold and itemsPlunder a pirate caveGet some quests from the Museum and its caretakerThis didn't make any sense, but I realized later that (for some reason) I needed to visit the museum exhibit on healing herbs before I could buy any.The game lets me buy up to 99 of each of its 6 spells. The first two, magic flame and firebolt, are the most valuable of the lot, usable in both outdoor areas and dungeons, and they do about 10 times the damage of my best attack. The other most valuable magic item is healing herbs, of which the game lets me carry 40. But buying the full complement of this kit costs around 10,000 gold pieces, and monsters deliver only about 10-50 per kill, so I thought I'd raise funds through gambling.Cute, but hardly worth the effort.There are two gambling mini-games: blackjack and \"flipflop.\" The latter game is like a giant Plinko board in which you bet on where a ball will land. It's interesting but too time-consuming, especially given that the rules of blackjack in this game are extremely favorable. I find my edge is around 115%, so as long as I keep my bets modest, I always wind up ahead in the end. This seemed a bit too simple and it was: it turns out that after you win about 2,000 gold pieces, you \"break the bank\" and guards swarm and pummel you (you can get the same outcome by robbing the bank). The only way around it is to travel from city to city, never winning too much money. What with the monsters I had to fight on the way, this took a little while.\"I swear I wasn't counting cards!\"In the midst of it, some thieves ambushed me and stole the Compendium. Lest I reload, apparently, the game warned me that this step was a necessary part of the game. Scripted events that you can't avoid no matter how badass your character are staples of CRPGs, of course, but it's handled oddly, and I'm not sure why it wasn't just part of the backstory to begin with.Isn't that handy?I lost track of all of the different types of monsters I've encountered. Only a few of them, such as \"Eaton warriors,\" have names reminiscent of any other CRPGs. Some of the names include bone dwellers, carrion manglers, mime ghouls, neural clouds, pit strikers, practon piercers, slime weirds, stinging rakishes, venom floaters, ventro flailers, wave skimmers, and wind stalkers. I would give the game points for originality except that the creatures aren't very well distinguished except by name. A few of them (at least, the ones in dungeons) have special attacks, like dissolving your armor, breaking your weapon, or draining your endurance, but for the most part they're interchangeable by name and unmemorable by icon.Insert \"yo momma\" joke here.Part of the game's tactic is supposed to be that certain weapons work better against certain foes--you can figure this out by trial-and-error or by buying clues from seers. But either way, it's hardly worth the time to swap out weapons when most enemies die from a few blows anyway.\u00a0\u00a0 Weapons, I should mention, come in several varieties--knives, clubs, bladed staffs, and so on--and in various conditions ranging from \"shoddy\" to \"great.\" I learned the hard way to keep hold of a couple of different weapons for when one gets shattered.To reach the castle island, I had to buy a boat.Things picked up when I raided Castle Kelfor, but the game follows Ultima I's and Ultima II's traditions of turning me into a mass murderer for the sake of the plot. I must retrieve certain artifacts from the chests in the castle, but opening chests causes the guards to swarm me, leading me to mercilessly slaughter them.I'm sure he was just doing his job.The castle also featured a mysterious woman named \"Cassandra\" who increased my \"charm\" attribute.\u00a0\u00a0 Ultimately, I got hold of a magic tulip that, when returned to the Museum, netted me another boost to my \"charm\" skill and an extra level.\u00a0\u00a0 Oh, yes--leveling. From what I can tell, I don't gain levels in this game through combat. In fact, there doesn't seem to be any reason for combat except to get enemies out of your way (and make a few paltry gold pieces). Instead, the Caretaker levels me up when I solve certain quests. I'm level 3 now; I don't know how may levels there are in the game. I had to find my way back to the Museum first, which turns out to occupy a corner on the westernmost part of the continent. Entering it involves answering some copy protection questions with the help of a fan page.\u00a0\u00a0 After raiding the castle, I followed another monitor in the Museum to the Isles of Three Sisters...\u00a0\u00a0 ...where I explored an eight-level pirate dungeon. The dungeon was in first-person view and featured a variety of tough monsters, chests, and traps (I learned the hard way that I needed to \"examine\" each corridor before striding on down.) I got very rich (>10,000 gold) from this trip and also found a jeweled crown.\u00a0\u00a0 When I returned to the museum, the Caretaker gave me a quest to recover the selfsame crown and a scepter. I returned the crown immediately. I'm not quite sure where to go for the scepter just yet--I think I've explored all of the places on the map--but this seemed like a good place to knock off for the day.I did die twice. Dying has very few consequences: you are immediately resurrected with your full complement of hit points, but with only a handful of food and gold pieces. Fortunately, the game lets you stash money in the bank (where it gains interest) just for such a situation. When I noticed this, it reminded me to take a break from the game to check on my IRA account, which--just like watching Veronica Mars in the middle of Faery Tale Adventure--is a good sign to me that the game isn't really captivating. I'm sure I'll still finish it, since it doesn't seem like it's going to take much longer, but we're talking Ultima II-level game play here, and we've seen a lot of CRPGs advance much further than that.I'm going to invest a couple more hours tonight, and if I haven't won, I'll take a Le Maitre des Ames break. Otherwise, you might see a \"won!\" posting tomorrow."}, {"title": "Le Maitre des Ames: Tr\u00e9s Agr\u00e9able", "date": "Monday, December 27, 2010", "text": "\"Menu of the day: disgusting sheep, rancid peas\" (?)I admit I started playing Le Maitre des Ames with the idea that I would probably just put in the six hours, collect the bonus points for trying out a non-English game, and then move on. I was almost relieved when it seemed technical problems would keep me from playing. But with those problems solved and thus no excuse, I pushed forward, and I'll be damned if Le Maitre des Ames doesn't have a real charm about it. It contains several elements that I'm finding for the first time in a first-person CRPG; it's somewhat of an evolution from Dungeon Master on the way to Ultima Underworld.Let's cover some of the ways this game distinguishes itself from its predecessors:Each room has its own character: different furniture, different wall-hangings, and a different look to the doors.The game (or, at least, this first level) is arranged in a logical manner. There's a dining room next to the kitchen, for instance, and an armory next to the barracks.Monsters are in logical places for logical reasons. Orc guards patrol passages, rats hang out in storerooms, a cook is working in a kitchen, and an exhausted fighter rests in a bedroom.You can talk to almost all sentient creatures (not the rats, obviously). Most have interesting things to say.You can pick up a lot of the things in the rooms. Unfortunately (see below), I don't know what many of them are.Picking up a key.The game is full of secret doors activated with switches and chains on the walls.There are messages all over the walls. Some help me, some taunt me. Some I'm having trouble translating; one seems to say \"Nothing will die, but you have to start somewhere.\" My favorite: \"Your passage, only the dust will remember.\"You can split your party and have them explore separately. I found this out when it happened accidentally: one of my characters fell through a hole in the floor and ended up alone. Fortunately, I was able to reunite them.My dwarf has fallen down a hole and is \"absent.\"I had several interesting encounters in today's gameplay. The first was with a cook in the kitchens. I'll offer my entire conversation:\u00a0Me: Who are you?Cook: I am the cook of the royal high court of VanirMe: What are you doing here?Cook: I'm making a vinaigrette dressing out of wood lice [I think]Me: Who is your king?Cook: My king was the greatest of all. He died.Me: Who is your master?Cook: The great Akkad, but he disappeared a long time ago.Me: Who is your god?Cook: Nilgar, patron of the traditional high cuisine.Me: Do you want to help us?Cook: I have no time, what with lunch and everything.Me: Give me a clue.Cook: Nothing is free in this world, you know?Me: Name your price.Cook: It will cost you 22 gold pieces.Me: Done.Cook: Beware of the singing howler mushrooms.\u00a0I ran into them later.\u00a0Me: Come with us.Cook: Are you kidding? With all the bugs swarming around here?Me: Goodbye and good luck.Cook: Your destiny is down the road. Goodbye.Later, an orc tells me he is a guard of the castle and he's there to keep out intruders like me, that his god is Gol Goroth, the incarnation of evil (and taken from Lovecraft's Cthulhu stories!), and I should \"tremble as the demon lord arrives on earth.\" When I ask him to come with me, he says something like, \"Over my dead body, sons of dogs!\"Moments later, we discovered his statement turned out to be quite prophetic.I run into a man named Rockeux who says he's searching for his old master, Sir Maltorn. I ask him to join me--he seems an obvious candidate for the empty slot the game leaves you for NPCs--but he says he's too exhausted to follow in my footsteps.Now, not everything is la vie en rose with this game. Obviously, the color sucks. You can't name your characters. Your characters get hungry and you have to eat the food you pick up. Unless I'm missing something, combat lacks the tactics of Dungeon Master and just consists of hitting \"fight\" repeatedly; when you hit your target, it says \"Paf!\"The wimpiest combat sound ever.Most important, I can't tell what most of the equipment I'm grabbing is, and since each character can only hold up to four items, this is a bit of a handicap. There are some things that look like potions, and weapons and armor that I can't find a way to evaluate against what I already have. And I've yet to figure out anything about the magic system.Some of you (especially you, Georges) have been a lot of help in translations--if anyone feels like helping me a little more, can you take a look at the manual and see if you can tell me what it says, if anything, about a) the different types of items you can pick up, and how you can tell what they are; and b) casting spells? (I OCR'd the manual but the watermark screws up the text order and keeps me from translating it all at once.) [Later edit: one of my readers got a friend who speaks French to translate the entire manual for me. I can't thank them enough, but I don't know if they want to be mentioned by name on the blog. Suffice to say: merci beaucoup to EH and JVR!]Pending that, I'm going to probably dip back into Legacy of the Ancients for a day.A good day's work. A bient\u00f4t!"}, {"title": "CRPG Tropes", "date": "Sunday, December 26, 2010", "text": "By now, probably everyone is familiar with the glorious thief of time known as TVTropes.org, a self-described \"catalog of the tricks of the trade for writing fiction.\" The site cautions that tropes are \"devices and conventions that a writer can reasonably rely on as being present in the audience members' minds and expectations,\" but that they are not clich\u00e9s. The catalog nonetheless has plenty of examples of clich\u00e9s, too.Despite the name, the wiki includes every form of media you can imagine: TV, movies, comic books, art, theater, music, and, of course, video games. Lately, I've taken to visiting the site after each game to see if any tropes are mentioned. There are far more tropes associated with more recent CRPGS, partly because more people know about them, but mostly because tropes require a certain level of storytelling, and the earliest CRPGs didn't have that.Nonetheless, these are some of my favorite tropes from the games we've played so far:\"Always Chaotic Evil\": Every orc that approaches you in Ultima II, every creature in the dungeon in Dungeon Master, everything that moves in Faery Tale Adventure, wants to kill you, and is thus naturally deserving of death themselves. Imagine if CRPGs forced you to treat every such creature as an individual? This trope, by the way, is wonderfully (if unintentionally) subverted in Wizardy, when you randomly encounter \"friendly\" versions of your foes. I thought one of my commenters had reported encountering a \"friendly Werdna\" upon achieving the final level of the game, but I can't find that comment.\"Gurrrrglrgug...How are you today?\"\"Arbitrary Headcount Limit\": Honestly, if I really want to defeat the Chaos Lord, why can't I resurrect every character in the hall of heroes and have them swarm the dungeon? In later games, like Baldur's Gate, I would play a paladin and pretend that he'd sworn an oath to never travel with more than five companions--it was the only way it made sense.\"Dude Where's My Respect\": This happens in almost every CRPG. You've been tasked with saving the world, but the world can't spare enough money to outfit you with a decent suit of armor. In Ultima II, Lord British makes me pay him for hit points! I love the entries for Oblivion on this.Or, you could just give me 9,999 hit points, and I'll go take care of Minax right now.\"Get Back Here Boss\": Foes that make you chase them around. This was one of the most annoying parts of Ultima II--and also the thieves in Dungeon Master.\"Karma Meter\": It shows up first in Ultima IV, as Hawkwind keeps track of your progress towards various virtues. It's also a key element of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Jade Empire, Baldur's Gate, and other games.\"Level Grinding\": Love this quote from this one: \"Only the hero ever has this advantage. It never occurs to townspeople to  walk around their village and bash slimes until they're strong enough  to face the pirate who's taken over.\"\"Nigh Invulnerability\": Applies to Lord British in the Ultima series.  Not even Mondain's skull or the Armageddon spell--which kills  everything else in the entire world--kills him. I did defeat him with a  cannon in Ultima III, but his death wasn't permanent.\"Order vs. Chaos\": At the end of Dungeon Master, I questioned whether there was a deliberate connection between it and The Saga of Recluce. Well, apparently, there are about one billion examples of this.\"Science Fiction vs. Fantasy\": This trope deals with the genre-blending that occurs in games like Might & Magic, Tera, and Legacy of the Ancients. I don't have a problem with it, exactly, but somehow spells and technology always seem to me like an uncomfortable fit.\"Sdrawkcab Name\": We've joked about this a lot with Trebor/Robert, Werdna/Andrew, Yendor/Rodney, and so on. There are other examples in Ultima V, Baldur's Gate, and Might & Magic, among others.I've made one contribution to the site, under the \"Wild Mass Guessing\" category, offering my theory that Mondain from Ultima I is a Sith Lord.Exhibit AA couple of weeks ago, an anonymous commenter said he was going to create an entry on \"spellcrafting,\" but I haven't been able to find it yet.For those of you who haven't discovered TVTropes until this posting, the rest of your evening is gone, so I'll leave you to it.

I'm just doing that thing you said you wouldn't mind where I play two games at once. I'm still in the midst of translating the manual for Maitre and  getting used to the interface. I think the game has a lot of potential,  but it seems a lot like work, and I'm feeling lazy this weekend.Legacy of the Ancients is the opposite of \"work\": it is an uncomplicated, plain little game--almost a throwback, really. It uses the same game engine as Questron, the first CRPG I ever played, about 26 years ago. I didn't play it as part of this project because of my PC/DOS restriction--a restriction that has come to feel a bit foolish, since this is yet another game in which the DOS version offers the poorest graphics (you can see a comparison of the C64 and DOS graphics at the game's MobyGames site).The game starts with the basest character creation possible: I simply name my character (I chose \"Lailoken\") and the action begins. I play a poor peasant in the land of Tarmalon who one day comes across a dead body on the side of the road. It belongs to a nameless previous adventurer who was in the middle of the quest to destroy a powerful and dangerous magic scroll called the Wizard's Compendium. I loot his body for the Compendium, two jade coins, and his magic bracelet and soon find myself transported to a mysterious building.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Only a poor peasant\" strikes me as uncomfortably classist.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The building is the Museum of the Ancients, an edifice constructed in times of yore by a race of aliens. It is apparently one of many scattered on different worlds. The museums allow the Ancients to view life on different worlds, but they are forbidden from interfering with the worlds' developments (a video monitor warns me not to \"feed the Tarmalon natives\"); the caretaker of the museum on Tarmalon apparently decided to break this rule.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It's like Might & Magic crossed with Star Trek.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As I continue wandering the  hallways, the bracelet begins speaking to me with the voice of the  previous owner, charging me to \"neutralize the evil Scroll of Spells  before it destroys everything!\" The rest of the museum is filled  with similar monitors that take coins of various denominations. With the two jade coins found on the body, I view exhibits titled  \"Art of Weaponry,\" which allows me to take a dagger, and \"Thornberry,\"  which tells me about a typical Tarmalon town, in which rich and poor  live separated by a stone wall. Having used my last coin on the latter  exhibit, I take the exhibit's offer to transport me there.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And thus the game begins. Thornberry  is a typical CRPG town, with a weapon and armor shop, a bank, and a transportation shop. Gameplay is isometric, with graphics on par with Ultima IV. Commands are all through the keyboard, with available actions listed on the left side of the screen.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 At the food shop, I got a  quest to deliver a bag of mail to the town of Big Rapids:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I also found a gambling parlor, where I indulged in a few rounds of blackjack featuring rules I would love to see on my next trip to Atlantic City.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Natural blackjack pays double!

So far, I have fought and killed pulp crawlers, bone dwellers, slash nettles, blistopods, scorpods, ventro flailers, carrion manglers, pit stalkers, venom floaters, and wind stalkers. All slain foes give up gold or items, and some of them can be converted to food--yes, this is another game in which you must maintain a rapidly-dwindling food supply.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Combat is, unfortunately, no more tactical than in Faery Tale Adventure. You just keep mashing \"F\" until you or the creature dies. There is a magic system in the game, but it reaches all the way back to Ultima I for its inspiration--you buy spells at shops and cast them until they run out, then buy more.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 What, exactly, does \"psycho strength\" mean?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Not all encounters are hostile. I bought some food from a bandit, a museum coin from a farmer, and a potion from a merchant.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As I slay creatures, I don't have any idea if I am developing experience or anything. My level remains firmly fixed at 1. The game manual seems to suggest that the museum caretaker will be the one to level me up, but I haven't figured out how to get back to the museum yet. I did figure out how to develop at least one statistic, though: one of the towns has a neat mini-game in which you have to fend off fireballs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 You do it by simply turning in the direction they're coming from, which sounds easy, but it gets pretty dicey at high levels when multiple fireballs are coming at the same time from multiple directions at different speeds. I did okay my first time out.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I had hoped that each town would feature a different side quest, but apparently they all involve mail delivery to the other towns. Nonetheless, I get about 100 gold pieces for each delivery, and it's an easy way to make money while I explore and figure out my next move.If it seems like an unexciting game, well it is, a bit. But the mini-games and gambling are a neat touch, and it's a good game to mess around with while I'm supposed to be watching It's a Wonderful Life with my family.There's a big blizzard approaching New England, and I don't feel like dealing with it, so I managed to get a last-minute ticket to San Diego tomorrow morning. I know my blogging usually falls off when I'm traveling, but this time I don't have any particular business to do, and I'm actually looking forward to the idea of hanging out on my hotel balcony, playing games, and only leaving my room to restock my wet bar. If I have any readers in that city, I'll be glad to meet you for a drink at the Green Flash.Tomorrow, we'll see what strikes my fancy the most: the interesting-but-difficult foreign game or the slightly-boring-but-simple Legacy of the Ancients."}, {"title": "Game 35: Le Maitre des Ames (1987)", "date": "Friday, December 24, 2010", "text": "\"The Master of Souls,\" if anyone's curious.As we saw, my first attempt to play a French CRPG wasn't exactly a rousing success. I didn't give up because it was a foreign game, and I didn't give up because I didn't have a manual. I gave up because of the combination of the two. Unfortunately, I'm facing the same issue with Le Maitre des Ames.Translation isn't a huge problem. The game begins with several screens explaining the game's historique. It speaks of a forgotten time of heroes--warriors and wizards--in a realm of unicorns. A royal wizard named Kharram Akkad, on the verge of extraordinary discoveries, disappeared during a violent storm. The player's party of four heroes observed the destruction and has decided to assail the wizard's keep to...well, to figure out what happened, I guess. It's a basic setup to what looks like a standard dungeon crawl in the spirit of Dungeon Master--multiple-character, first-person, real-time.Character creation was also fairly easy to figure out. It uses a system reminiscent of Alternate Reality: the City in which you watch a rapidly-changing succession of numbers from 0-100 representing six characteristics: life, strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, and charisma. You hit the spacebar to \"freeze\" the numbers and take what you get.\"Thief\"....something about having an eclectic selection of skills.The game conflates classes and races, so you can choose your four characters from among warriors, magicians, clerics, thieves, dwarves, and elves. After making the selection, you spend a random amount of gold on some weapons and armor.This is exactly where I would have expected to find a \"glaive-guisarme\" and a \"bec-de-corbin.\"After creating four of the characters, you find yourself in a badly-colored dungeon. These screenshots are easily familiar to players of American first-person CRPGs.This is where I began to run into trouble. All commands are via the mouse, except for the number pad from which you can control movement. Right-clicking and left-clicking do different things depending what icon you have selected. As best as I can figure, from top to bottom, they are: move, look, listen, don't know because \"talk\" is below--maybe \"eat?\", sleep, pick up or trade items, open doors (usually doesn't work--maybe they need keys), talk, attack, and save/load the game. The problem is, I get inconsistent results when I click/right-click on various characters and objects.The characters have little symbols next to them, too, and I think one indicates whether the character is in the party (it seems you can drop characters and have them wait at fixed positions) and the other indicates who is the \"active\" character.Naturally, you encounter creatures. The first couple of times, I bumbled through combat with them:The other options are \"attempt to talk,\" \"observe reactions,\" and \"try to flee.\"But later I tried talking to them and discovered something pretty neat: you can converse with monsters over all sorts of subjects: \"Who are you?\"; \"Who is your master?\"; \"Where is your kingdom?\" and so on. You can even ask them to join you!At first, their responses were gibberish to me......but as a sly veteran of CRPGs, I realized that the intelligence of the active character made a difference. I switched to my wizard, and the foreign writing disappeared! Well...I mean, the in-game foreign writing disappeared. It was still in French.Here, I'm asking him something about carrion, and he's telling me that I can't leave because of something to do with something reptilian. This is going to be hard.By the way: \"orc\" in French is apparently orque. I probably could have figured that out.Even though there's a lot I don't know yet, such as...Why can't I pass a lot of the doors?Why would I want to dislodge one of my characters from the party temporarily?How do I access my inventory?Can I do anything with the tables, shields-on-walls, and crates found in the game?Do killed monsters drop anything? How do I search?What is that face up above my game window? And what is the empty box next to it?Is there anything more to combat than just selecting \"combattre\" each round?How do I cast spells?...I think I can figure it out, given time. The major problem I'm having is that the game won't save. Like many games of the era, it wants me to swap out the \"game\" disk with a \"save\" disk when I choose the save option, which of course doesn't make sense running it in an emulator. Most of the time I can find a way around this, but not with Le Maitre des Ames, yet.My attempts to find a game manual--even in French--have failed, and my French definitely isn't good enough to peek around in message boards looking for solutions to the technical problem. (It doesn't help the Googling that there's a novel of the same name by an author named Irene Nemirovsky.) Georges, I'd be glad to take up your offer of assistance; likewise to any of my European readers. [Later Edit: Jason got me the manual, and I solved the save problem by mounting an A: drive in DOSBox. Looks like I have no excuse not to give this one a proper try!]If I can get past the save issue and the gameplay mysteries, this might be a game worth playing. Certainly this depth of dialog is unusual in a first-person dungeon-crawler, and I really would like to explore it more.I might take tomorrow off for family reasons, so Joyeux No\u00ebl, everyone!"}, {"title": "First Expedition: A Quick Note", "date": "Thursday, December 23, 2010", "text": "First Expedition sounded like an interesting game: a naval navigation simulator set, for some reason, on an alien world called Yorland. The detail that it provides on things like triangulation, firing cannons, and navigating stormy seas suggests that it is a cousin to Sid Meier's Pirates!, first released the same year.But whoever wrote the MobyGames entry is on hallucinogens, because there's really no way you can justify this as a CRPG. Yes, the manual does start with the words, \"You play the role of Braun at the helm of an explorer craft.\" But come on: in Half Life you \"play the role\" of Gordon Freeman, but no one would try to justify that as a CRPG.Screenshot courtsey of MobyGamesIn any event, even if I was interested in playing around with knots and fuel and trading goods, the question is a bit academic since I can't get the game to run on any of my DOS emulators. It crashes almost immediately after startup with an error about not being able to find some file or another. I've tried downloads from two sites and get the same thing.And since it's not a CRPG anyway, on to...sacrebleu! Un autre jeu en fran\u00e7ais! Let's see if I do better at this one than Tera: La Cit\u00e9 des Cr\u00e2nes.That sounds too dangerous for me.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Nope. Sorry, lads. I hate to disappoint you. But I've had it with this game. I gave it well over the six hour minimum, and I stand by my summary in the last posting: huge, empty, and boring.Since last night, I did make it to the capital city of Marheim, where I met the singularly unhelpful king:Between the king and some other people in town, I picked up a few clues. The king wants his children back. I need to seek two women--one good, one evil. I suspect the \"evil\" one is the witch who lives in the \"dim forest of Grimwood,\" whose gaze is death and only the light of the sun can destroy her. Finally, I must seek my enemy on the Astral Plane.There were some apples in a couple of the houses that the game kindly allowed me to save for later bouts of hunger.I kept following the main road until it came to an end somewhere on the east coast. It was during this process that I decided the game and I weren't going to last together. It took about 20 minutes to walk from the city to the end of the line. On the map, this is about 1/5 the total width of the continent. I encountered nothing of consequence along the way. There were two castles that were completely empty.When I reached the peninsula at the end of the road, I did find a watchtower containing a seashell that, when blown on the water's edge, summoned a turtle. He kindly allowed me to ride on his back, with much improved speed.This isn't enough to save the game. I'm bored to tears with it. The thought of making my way to all these far corners of the map, even if I find faster transportation, fills me with dread. Nope, it's over. And the walkthrough makes me feel I've made the right decision.Yesterday, I promised a bit of video, so here it is. I purposefully die so you can see what happens.From the walkthroughs, apparently finishing the game involves rescuing the princess, finding a series of statues to enter the invisible city of Azal, entering the Astral Plane, fighting a navigation puzzle, and killing the necromancer with a wand. You then get to marry the princess and live happily ever after. If you're really interested in seeing the end, a German guy named Elanarae has a whole series of \"let's play\" videos on the game. Here's the last one--only a minute.It appears you get a magical swan at some point which cuts down on travel time, but honestly, I watched the last three of his videos and most of it was simply flying, flying, flying the swan from one place to another while he talked about what game he was going to play next.I feel like I played long enough for a GIMLET, especially since I viewed much of the rest, so here it is:1. Game World. There are some nice physical features--forests, mountains, farms, and such--but there's not much in it. The back story is the standard necromancer-taking-over-the-world fare. The \"three brothers\" motif sounded interesting, but the game doesn't really do anything with it. Score: 4.2. Character Creation & Development. Not much to speak of. Your \"bravery\" stat goes up as you kill creatures and your vitality stat goes up with it. Luck is influenced by talking to certain people. All the walkthroughs agree with me that your character becomes invincible way too fast. Score: 2.3. NPC Interaction. Consists of talking to static NPCs and getting a single hint. And there aren't many NPCs. Score: 2.4. Encounters & Foes. Repetitive and boring. You meet the same foes all over the land, most of which fall quickly to your sword. They do nothing interesting--just charge you en masse. They do re-spawn, so you can kill as many as you want. Score: 2.5. Magic & Combat. Also repetitive and boring. There are no spells--magic is all through physical items. Combat consists of choosing a weapon--and there's not much choice--and hitting a single \"attack\" button. It's really hard to survive at first and, very quickly, far too easy. Score: 1.6. Equipment. The various magic items, and how you have to discover their uses, are somewhat interesting. There are only a handful of weapons, though, and no armor. Score: 3.7. Economy. You get gold in the game, but all you can use it for is to buy food and give it to beggars (unless I missed something). Score: 2.8. Quests. One main quest with multiple parts. No side quests, no different outcomes. Score: 3.9. Graphics, Sound, Inputs. The graphics are actually quite good and probably the best part of the game. Even in the DOS version, they're as attractive as an isometric game up to this point. The music is intolerable--thankfully, there is a \"music off\" command--but the sounds, while rare, are occasionally interesting. Controls are both mouse and keyboard and reasonably intuitive. Score: 6. 10. Gameplay. The game is fairly non-linear. I'll give it that. But the huge game world offers nothing valuable. It should have been contracted to 1/4 of its size. It's far too easy and offers no replayability. Score: 2.Final score: 27. Definitely one of the lower-ranked games on my blog. My apologies to those of you who disagree, but I just don't understand what you see in the game. The game manual brags that it features 17,000 screens. The developers should have put something in them.Next up: First Expedition, which some of you have said doesn't belong on the CRPG list. Let's find out.Yes, with the entire kingdom at stake, this is a good time to be cryptic.Many more breaks like that, and I'll have to re-title my blog \"The Occasional CRPG Enthusiast.\" It took me a while to get back into the swing of Faery Tale Adventure, but I fought the urge to move on to First Expedition and got back on the trail of the elusive main quest, with the help of maps offered by Acrin1 and Andy, and with a clue offered by Jason Dyer.Even before Jason spoke, the crypt had been nagging me. The first steps on the main quest are probably near the beginning town of Tambry, the graveyard is near Tambry, so what are the odds that nothing happens in the crypt? I figured I should visit at night, and sure enough I encountered a spectre who tasked me with retrieving the bones of the Ancient King in exchange for his help destroying the evil necromancer.Although the pronoun is confusing, I assume he means he'll help me destroy the necromancer, not the Ancient King.I had no idea where to find these bones, so I decided to adopt a plan of just following the road network using the \"always choose the right path\" system and seeing where it took me. The path from Tambry bent from the south to the west to the north, across a river, past the beggar mentioned in my previous posting, and to an inn where I found food and rest but no help. Back on the road, this time heading west for a long while. There is simply no excuse for the size of the game world. It takes a good 20 minutes of real time to walk between towns, and there's nothing interesting in between except the occasional battle or bit of treasure. It would be one thing if the enormous world was peppered with caves and ruins and such, like Morrowind, but Faery Tale Adventure is big just to be big.I encountered an old man on the side of the road who said, \"Kind deeds  could gain thee a friend from the sea.\" At length, I came across another  inn, which I would have sworn was the same one I just left except I had  been walking west for a quarter of an hour. I backtracked to the last branch in the path and, after another long  trek, came to the Tombs of Hemsath. That sounded promising for my quest  to retrieve a set of bones. This gave me my first look at a Faery Tale Adventure dungeon,  and I'm sure I will surprise no one to report that it is huge and boring and empty, except for the same types of creatures I found  outside.After almost half an hour in the tomb's interminable, featureless hallways, I began to reflect that Weevil and Logan have a lot more similarities than differences. This is because I was watching Veronica Mars on my other monitor. Friends, it's generally a bad sign when you feel compelled to watch TV in order to break the monotony of your game, although I'm not particularly disappointed because it turns out that Veronica Mars is a very cool show.After a maze of endless doors, in which I used most of my accumulated keys......I found a tomb containing my prize: a single bone.Returning it to the crypt, I was rewarded with a crystal shard. I assume this will help me win the game in some way, although it still leaves me a bit clueless as to how to continue the main quest. But with the maps provided by my commenters, I can see the location of some other towns to explore.Part of the adventure in this game is figuring out the uses for the various objects that you find. I have quite a few of them. The game is similar to Ultima II in which slaying various creatures rewarded you with skeleton keys and blue tassels and such. In this game, the various objects, with their associated uses, from left to right in the screenshot, are:Four types of weapons: daggers, maces, swords, and bowsArrows for the bowBlue stones. I have no idea what they do; the game won't let me use them.Green jewels. They create light when it's dark.Glass vials. Restore hit points.Crystal orbs. Not sure.Bird totems. They give you a map of the surrounding area and usually create a video corruption so bad I have to quit DOSBox and restart.Gold rings. Unknown.Jade skulls. They kill every enemy on the visible screen--sort of like the skull of Mondain but without losing eighths. Very handy.Keys of various colors. They open corresponding doors.I got a hint about how to use the totems from a guy on the side of the road, so I suspect the orbs, blue stones, and gold rings will be subjects of similar hints.Aside from lacking much direction, my main problem now is a certain lack of challenge. My \"bravery\" is almost 350 and my vitality about a third of that, and it's been ages since I died. The game keeps throwing hosts of easily-defeated foes at me. Here's hoping I find some more clues and challenges in Marheim, my next stop. A lot of you seem to want me to finish this one, so I'll stick with it as long as I can.Thanks for your patience during my absence. As I said in my last post, I'm off from work until January 10, so I hope to provide a posting a day until then (excepting Christmas, perhaps). Video to come tomorrow."}, {"title": "A Quick Update", "date": "Tuesday, December 14, 2010", "text": "I offer the same excuse so often I should just copy-and-paste it, but here it is again: I had to go away on another business trip, I thought I'd have time to play and post in the evenings, but it's turned out that I'm busier than I thought. I apologize for this, especially since Google Analytics tells me I got a huge influx of new readers a few days ago.The good news: when I return home on December 19, I will be facing three weeks of vacation--going nowhere, doing nothing in particular except pounding out the CRPGs. I am quite committed to reach Game 50 by the time my blog turns one year old in February.I might still squeak in a post before I return, but don't count on it. Expect copious posts for the holidays instead.Thanks for your continued readership."}, {"title": "Faery Tale Adventure: Clueless", "date": "Thursday, December 9, 2010", "text": "I think I'm supposed to do more than just kill lots of people.So my dying father, the Master at Arms, entrusted me with a quest to save the kingdom from an evil necromancer. And I really, really would like to do that. Real bad. But I just don't know how. This game world is huge, sparsely populated, and devoid of any clues except a few that have to do with the uses of various magic items. I've slaughtered countless ogres, goblins, skeletons, and phantoms, built up my bravery and vitality to epic levels, and yet I have no idea what to do next.There are plenty of places that look like they ought to have stuff. For instance, the manual makes a big deal about how the land's champion, the Red Knight, has gone missing. In my wanderings, I came across the Red Knight's castle. Now if I was designing a CRPG--I'm just saying--I would have maybe put some clues in the castle about what happened to the Red Knight. The player could use the clues to go on some kind of mission--call it a \"quest\"--to find the missing hero and perhaps make the world a bit of a better place. I might even have these clues delivered by a computer-controlled character (call him an \"NPC\"; God, I'm on a roll) who could \"talk\" to the player. Is anyone writing this down?\"Hellooooooo!\"Instead, the Red Knight's castle is empty, and so I move on. But at least the castle isn't the only exciting location in the game! No, sir. Here's a \"Great Stone Ring\" in which nothing happens, as far as I can tell:And here's a crypt in the middle of a graveyard. I had to unlock the door and everything! But, true to the game's form, there was nothing inside the crypt:The towns are devoid of residents except for the occasional innkeeper. When I finally found this beggar on a bridge, I wanted to kiss him. But all he did was tell me what green jewels do (they create light). It's like I started the game too late, the evil necromancer has already won, and I'm one of the last five people alive.Now, granted, I haven't explored every nook of the game yet. The world, as I said, is quite large--the game manual even brags about it--and I'm sure there are a lot more empty buildings to discover. But this game, like Dungeon Master, has a fondness for the first level of Maslow's hierarchy. First, you get hungry, several times per day, and you need to buy food to stave off starvation. As far as I can tell, there's no way to carry food with you--you have to buy it and eat it immediately.The world of Holm has never heard of a \"doggie bag.\"Second, your character gets tired. If you happen to have a handy bed nearby, you can walk on to it and your tired PC will take a nap. But if you can't find a bed for a while, well, old Julian will just decide to drop down and go to sleep wherever he happens to be. Usually, this results in some ogres coming along and pounding him to death while he remains in what is essentially a coma. Unlike hunger, the game gives you no indication that your character is getting tired; he just suddenly faints in the middle of a field.Both of these factors discourage wandering off over the horizon to seek adventure, because you want to ensure you're within reasonably proximity to the nearest bed and food supply.On the good side, I've gotten really good at combat. On the bad side, combat simply involves wielding a weapon and frantically waving it at the closest enemy until it dies. No real tactics to it. Each kill builds your bravery, which makes the next kill easier. In a way, it's a predecessor of the \"action RPG\" genre like Diablo in which combat is based partly on statistics but partly on how fast you can click--only without the interesting variety of attacks or quality of animation that make modern action RPGs tolerable.Julian on a field of slaughter. The odd lighting is from the green jewel.As I mentioned in my last post, if you die--something that hasn't happened in a while--a little fairy comes along and decides whether to raise you. The odds of this happening are based on your luck statistic. If it fails, Julian is permanently dead, and his younger brother, Phillip, takes on the quest. I assume that if Phillip dies, Kevin is your last chance. I thus can't quite decide if it's \"cheating\" to reload after I die, but I don't feel like building up another character from scratch. Whether the other brothers ever get a role in the game should Julian survive, I have no idea.Finally, the equipment selection is a little lame. There are, from what I can tell, four weapons: dirk, mace, sword, and bow. There is no armor. There are a handful of magic items and sundries--keys of different colors, magic skulls that kill all the enemies on the screen, vials that heal you, totems that show you an area map, and so on--that you get from various dead creatures, sort of like Ultima II. The uses of the magic items are something of a mystery, but as we've seen, the random NPCs give you clues, and I've figured out others by just messing with them.My stockpile of goods.I can't imagine any reason to keep playing this game except the vague hope that a story will start to coalesce and the game will turn out to do something unusual and interesting with the ol' necromancer-taking-over-the-kingdom plot. I'm going to give it a few more hours to see if I can stumble on anything that has to do with the game's main quest. Hints always welcome.Does anyone know if this game originally came with a map? I tried to search for one, but I only looked at it briefly before I decided it was full of spoilers."}, {"title": "Game 34: The Faery Tale Adventure: Book 1 (1987)", "date": "Wednesday, December 8, 2010", "text": "Faery Tale Adventure is definitely not a famous CRPG. Barton doesn't mention it. It's Wikipedia entry is barely more than a stub. Its manual exists only as a text file on the Lemon Amiga site. And yet, after a few hours of play, I find it very promising. Its graphics and sound are quite good for the era; it features an original story; and it has a very intuitive top-down screen that (as Wikipedia notes) anticipates Ultima VII by several years.And it has a cool storybook graphic.The setup is as follows: The peaceful kingdom of Holm has fallen into dark times. Ogres and goblins maraud the land. A magic talisman is stolen from the village of Tambry by an evil sorcerer and his undead army; without its protection, the village comes under constant attack. The mayor sends the Master at Arms to beg the king's assistance, but the Master soon returns, fatally wounded, with the news that the king's daughter has been kidnapped, and the necromancer threatens to kill her unless the king submits to his will. The land's champion, the Red Knight, is missing and feared dead.It's not all about your village, you know.With his last gasp, the Master at Arms charges his three sons--the brave Julian, the cunning Phillip, and the bookish Kevin--to fulfill the prophecies of the seer Malbareth, find a series of magic artifacts, defeat the  necromancer in his stronghold, and recover the village's talisman.You start the game playing Julian, and frankly I don't know how and when you switch to the other brothers. In true CRPG fashion, I looted the houses of my fellow townsfolk, finding various magic items and sundries, before attempting to leave the town.I never claimed to be a hero.Gameplay is from a top-down perspective. The interface is smooth and continuously scrolling--the first isometric live-action game that I've played so far, which ought to give Faery Tale Adventure some bonus points. The game uses the mouse, although (unlike Dungeon Master) there are analogous keyboard commands to every mouse command, and I find the keyboard much more intuitive.The lower left corner narrates your actions in the past-tense, as if it's part of a (very boring) story, in keeping with the \"faery tale\" theme. Under the narration are your vital statistics: bravery (battle skill), luck (affects chance of being resurrected after death by a \"good fairy\"), kindness (helps in communication), vitality (hit points), and wealth (gold).After looting Tambry, I headed out the front gates and was promptly slain by a passing skeleton. As the manual promised might happen, a fairy glided along and resurrected me.An inauspicious beginning.My second trip out was a little more promising, as I quickly dispatched two ogres and looted their bodies. Combat is a little unexciting. Essentially, you wield a weapon (all I can afford right now is a dirk) and press the number pad key corresponding to the direction of your foe, repeatedly, until one of you dies.I noticed that my \"bravery\" went up two points after defeating the ogres, so this is perhaps how your character develops. There's no other suggestion of levels or experience points in the game. I'm not yet sure how to develop luck, kindness, or (maximum) vitality.As for other discoveries: it appears that there are chests sitting around in the wilderness to plunder; there are various magic items (totems, skulls, orbs) with various properties I have to figure out on my own; my vitality increases as I wait around; and when night falls in the game, the screen darkens.Holm at night.The biggest gameplay mysteries I have is if there's any way to rest or wait. The innkeeper/shopkeeper asks if I want to stay the night, but I can't figure out any command that lets me do that.So far, The Faery Tale Adventure seems slight but intriguing. I'll give it a few more days and see how it develops."}, {"title": "Dungeon Master: Final Ranking", "date": "Tuesday, December 7, 2010", "text": "Dungeon MasterUnited StatesFTL Games (developer and publisher)Released 1987 for Atari ST, 1988 for Amiga, 1989 for FM Towns, 1990 for PC-98 and Sharp X68000, 1991 for SNES, 1992 for DOSDate Started: 9 November 2010Date Ended: 6 December 2010Total Hours: 32Difficulty: Moderate (3.0/5)Final Rating: 47Ranking at Time of Posting: 29/33 (88%)Ranking at Game #453: 412/453 (91%) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Dungeon Master is a seminal game, no doubt. As the first real-time 3D game, its influence can be seen in countless later games, particularly the Eye of the Beholder series and Ultima Underworld. It shepherds in a new era of gaming, and in the minds of many players, I'm sure that turn-based 3D games like Wizardry and Might & Magic were suddenly lacking.I can't quite jump on that bandwagon. While I admire the technical innovations of Dungeon Master, I can't honestly say that I enjoyed it more than turn-based CRPGs. The constant frantic clicking got old after a while. (\"Many gamers suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome today,\" jokes Barton [p. 236], \"May have Dungeon Master to blame!\")As I was finishing the game and thinking about the fusion of Order and Chaos into Balance, I began to wonder if the creators of Dungeon Master weren't influenced by L. E. Modesitt's Saga of Recluce series, which features many of the same themes. It turns out that Modesitt's first Recluce book post-dates Dungeon Master by about four years, so I guess not, unless Modesitt was an avid Dungeon Master player. Or is there a third original source? Or is it just a very obvious theme?With that question lingering, we move on to the GIMLET score.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1. Game world. Reasonably interesting. The manual features a long, novel-like exposition, written by author Nancy Holder (who would later go on to write a bunch of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novelizations). The story sort-of sits in the background, though, with no further overt references until the end of the game, when you encounter Lord Chaos. There's something of a twist ending in that the originator of your quest, Librasius, is himself as evil as Chaos. The order/chaos dichotomy is not one we've seen in a CRPG so far. I'd give the story more points if the game included it better during the gameplay itself. As it is, I'll go with a final score of 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a02. Character creation and development. Character creation is definitely original, although I'm not sure that this is in a good way. The game really doesn't gain anything by having you select your characters from a \"Hall of Heroes\" instead of just creating them, and I'm not sure what purpose the developers thought they were serving. Character development, on the other hand (described in this posting), is very satisfying, using a skill use-based system that we won't see again until The Elder Scrolls. Since the best strategy is to develop all of your characters in all of the possible classes, there isn't much of an opportunity to role-play them, and in any event the choice of classes and sexes has no effect on the subsequent game. Final score: 7.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Selecting heroes on Level 1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 3. NPC interaction. There are no NPCs in the game. This is the game's most disappointing non-feature. Final score: 0.4. Encounters & foes. I counted something like 25 monsters in the game, and many of them are original to Dungeon Master. Each has a different variety of attacks, defenses, and weaknesses, and figuring these out was part of the strategy. Frustratingly, though, the game doesn't tell you anything about the creatures--not even their names. There is some basic AI: most enemies flee when their hit points dip, and they move out of the way of closing doors (although they can't open doors themselves). Most of the encounters are random, and some enemies do respawn, giving you plenty of opportunity to build up your skills. Final score: 7.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The mushroom people turned out to be called \"screamers.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5. Magic and combat. Although the constant flurry of clicks wore me down, I give a lot of credit to the landmark real-time combat system that the game uses. Combat is very tactical, with numerous weapon and magic options, and attack functions that increase with your skills. The magic system is one of the most original encountered, with a combination of runes and mana, and a spell list that only slowly reveals itself. The way you use the game's many spells has a significant impact on the overall experience. Aside from the annoyance of picking up missile weapons one-by-one after each combat, I can hardly think of anything negative to say about it. Final score: 8.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Fun fact: if you cast \"see through walls\" at the door on the first level, you see Lord Librasius (Order) standing outside.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 6. Equipment. My biggest frustration with the game, right up to the end, was a lack of any way to evaluate the equipment. You find a host of magic rings, crowns, and amulets with no clue as to what they do; weapons that give you no indication of their damage; and armor that offers no information about its relative level of protection. It's all trial, error, and guesswork. Perhaps this was supposed to add to the fun, but I found it maddening. Aside from that, there is quite a variety to the equipment you can find and use, particularly the magic items. A little description would have given a high final score, but as it is: Final score: 3. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 7. Economy. This pissed me off a bit. The game is rife with jewels, gems, and coins, and I dutifully picked them up and kept them, assuming there would be a place that I could use them later on. Aside from one small vault, there was no reason to hold on to any of these valuables. And there's nowhere else in the game to buy or sell anything. Final score: 1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Leyla's worthless inventory. Chaos Strikes Back better let me spend this stuff.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 8. Quests. The game has one reasonably-compelling main quest, and all of the gameplay is bent on it. There are no side quests, and the main quest--aside from the bad \"alternate ending\"-- really has only one choice, with no roleplaying opportunities. Final score: 3. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 9. Graphics, sound, inputs. All of them are quite good. I wish there had been more keyboard commands and less reliance on the mouse, but this game is notable as the first one to actually use the mouse. As you've seen, graphics and sound, while nowhere near the quality of modern game A/V, are certainly good enough to enjoy the game. The final cutscene is well-animated, the Wilhelm scream that your characters emit upon death is particularly memorable, and I like how you can hear monsters moving in adjacent hallways and creeping up behind you. Final score: 6. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 10. Gameplay. This is always tough to assess in a dungeon crawler. Like any of them, the gameplay is almost entirely linear, and it delivers the exact same experience on gameplay. In terms of difficulty and pacing, I think it was a tad too difficult and a tad too long, but only a tad. I won't be eager to replay it, but I'm not sorry I played it once. Final score: 6. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Total ranking: 47. This has it beating Beyond Zork but not Might & Magic, Ultima IV, or Starflight, all of which I agree I enjoyed more. I admire Dungeon Master for its innovations, but despite them I don't think it's a \"great\" game.Finishing this game took me damned near a month, although it was an extremely busy month, work-wise. I'm really going to have to hustle if I want to complete 50 games by the end of my blog's first year."}, {"title": "Dungeon Master: Won!", "date": "Monday, December 6, 2010", "text": "That's gratitude for you.Well, Dungeon Master had the oddest and most unsatisfying ending of any CRPG I've ever encountered. After I found the Firestaff--the relic on which my entire quest was based--I painstakingly made my way back up to the first level and to the dungeon doors. There, I encountered Lord Librasius, who took the Firestaff from me, declared he no longer had any need for me, and slaughtered all of my characters. That's it. End of game.Well, let's do a quick GIMLET rating and call it a day.I forgot to mention in yesterday's posting on combat that your characters can take injuries as well as hit point damage. Note how Nabi has bandages on his head, chest, and hand.No! Just kidding! Part of me was tempted to end the posting here and see what you did in the comments section. I'm actually glad I did traipse all the way back up to Level 1 to get the alternate ending above, but of course that wasn't the \"real\" ending. I did win, though.Level 12 featured \"materializers.\" I had some issues with those.Level 12 turned out to be the last large, regular level. Getting through it was a struggle. It featured some of the toughest monsters found so far in the game, including armored knights, weird floaty creatures that I couldn't hit with normal weapons, and giant four-legged spider things. Except now that I've won the game, I can check a walkthrough and refer to them by their proper names as animated armour, materializers, and oitus. I have no idea where the author of the walkthrough got these names, but you don't make up something like \"oitu\" on your own.The oitus weren't too hard, but the animated armour could take a hell of a beating and keep coming, and the only thing I had that could damage the materializers was the DES EW (\"weaken nonmaterial beings\") spell. Let that be a lesson, kids: don't drop the vorpal blades just because something more interesting comes along.Fortunately, I was saved by what I can only imagine was a game bug: while being chased by the creatures on the level, I found a particular part of the hallway that they wouldn't pass. This allowed me to pound on them but step back when my health got too low, rest and heal, and resume my assault. I used the opportunity to strip my characters of weapons and build up their ninja levels.Fortunately, stone golems are slow.At the end of the level, I had three RA keys, so I returned to Level 7 and used them to open the door to the Tomb of the Firestaff. The level was guarded by stone golems, but I was able to use the door trick to defeat them, though it took a long time. Ultimately, I made my way to the chamber of the Firestaff and picked it up.Scrolls on the level gave me a basic sense of how to win the game. Together, they read:The power gem is sealed in the mountain by a strange magical force. ZO KATH RA might create a plasma that could burn through the amalgam encasing the gem. Balance is the ultimate good. The Firestaff can restore balance or destroy it. Neither Chaos nor Order is truly balanced. The Firestaff can contain a being of pure alignment with its fluxcage. Once fluxcaged, a being can be transmuted by the staff, which should always be used for balance.These scrolls confirmed my belief, stated in the first posting, that there is something amiss with Lord Librasius (Order). This was confirmed by my side-trip to the surface. After reloading from this trip, I used a hidden staircase at the back of Level 7 to head all the way down to Level 13.Unlike the walkthrough I consulted (after I had won), I refuse to call the wingless fire-breathing lizard a \"dragon.\"On Level 13, I encountered a host of demons, black flame creatures (these were the things I closed my last posting with; they turned out to be easy: they can't move and die with a few DES EWs), and Lord Chaos himself. But after screwing around the level for a while and dying about six times, I couldn't figure out how to do anything with Lord Chaos, so I proceeded down to Level 14. There, I found a fire-breathing giant lizard. I defeated him in a long, long battle that involved a lot of ducking behind pillars to avoid his fire attacks. His death provided me with a bunch of \"dragon steaks,\" which really hit the spot.The lizard's lair was strewn with coins that I dutifully picked up, only to find that they (along with a number of other coins I'd been carrying since Level 3) had no value. Thanks, Dungeon Master!The protected Gem of Power.At the back of the level, I found the Gem of Power encased in its magic sheathing. By touching it with the Firestaff, I fused the two objects and found that the staff now had a \"fluxcage\" option. Time to take on Lord Chaos!Lord Chaos surrounded by fluxcages.I videoed my first attempt, which ended in quick death. I had no idea what I was doing, randomly firing fluxcages at him and trying to \"fuse\" him. The video below starts with me getting the Gem of Power and finishes with my last character feebly throwing things at Lord Chaos before dying in terrific pain.This was the closest I got to defeating Lord Chaos for a while. When I returned to Level 13 after reloading, I couldn't get past the demons for what seemed like forever. They're very tough. I was only able to defeat any of them by hiding behind a door in the corner, opening it, firing off fireballs, and closing the door before they could retaliate.Demons suck.Finally, I was able to get close to Chaos again, and I pretty much did the same thing I did the first time, only this time it actually worked. I turned on the video capture as soon as I realized something was happening, so here's that feed:If you don't feel like watching it, the game ends with a cutscene showing Chaos and Order (where did he come from?) fused back together into the Grey Lord. The Grey Lord then destroys the Firestaff in the lava of the mountain, and somehow the resulting magic restores the buildings and foliage in the nearby town of Viborg, where members of the citizenry celebrate by doing back flips.Left a mystery is exactly what happens to Theron and the heroes inside the dungeon. I guess we find out in the sequel, about 60 games from now.Consulting a couple of walkthroughs, I see there were a few things I missed:My characters were mostly \"expert\" level in each class when the game ended, and I see that there were five more levels they could have progressed. I can't imagine how long it would have taken to do that, but as Georges noted in yesterday's posting, higher levels mean more options with weapons.I missed an \"invisibility\" spell that might have helped with the demons and Lord Chaos.There were a bunch of invisible pits on Level 12--I forgot to mention that. I could have made things a lot easier by luring the animated armours into them.If I had saved one of the magic freezing boxes for the end, I could have held Lord Chaos in place, surrounded him with flux cages, and defeated him quite easily. I used my last one on the dragon, unfortunately.Let's GIMLET this game and move on to Faery Tale Adventure!"}, {"title": "Dungeon Master: Battling Forward", "date": "Sunday, December 5, 2010", "text": "An ear of corn found next to a sewage drain.

Every time I settle in for a night of gameplay, suddenly it's time to put up the tree, or buy a wreath, or watch The Muppet Christmas Carol for the millionth time. Does this woman not know that I have a Firestaff to find?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was Level 10 or the Nutcracker.

I am currently on Level 12, and boy is it a challenge. A quick question for veterans of the game: almost all of my characters are \"adept\" in almost all of the classes. Where should I be at this point in the game?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dammit.

There were some more tough wasps on Level 11, and a section where I had to slice my way through endless hordes of goblins or something. There were more annoying thieves on both levels; fortunately, these fall to a single fireball, so I got in the habit of keeping one queued for when I heard an annoying giggle.Both levels also introduced a new element: choices in the doors to take. I found keys on each level that opened one of a selection of doors, and notes on the walls, like this one...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 ...suggested that I wouldn't be able to try both. On Level 10, this left a small space to the west that I was never able to explore. On Level 11, where I had to choose one of three doors, it left an enormous unexplored space. Something seemed wrong with that, but I spent a long time looking around for additional keys and found none.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I found a pair of \"boots of speed\" on each level, which seem to make my characters a bit faster in combat, and a wide selection of weapons and armor that I think are better than the ones I had before, but of course I can't be sure.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A medieval-style vending machine.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I had just begun to wonder why I was carrying around a selection of copper coins--some going back to Level 4 or 5--when I came across a room full of slots that accepted the copper coins and gave me magic items in return. These include fire bombs and magic freezing boxes.This is a good time to talk about combat in Dungeon Master, because I've yet to cover it in detail. This game's approach is unique in that it's tactical but real-time. The monsters don't wait for you to make your moves.Assume I'm facing a group of beholders, like this:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Offensively, I have five options:Attack with a melee weaponAttack with a ranged weaponCast a spellEmploy a magic itemThrow an objectBut each of the options except the last has a number of sub-options based on the type of item equipped. In the above screenshot, Leyla has a crossbow, which can't do anything but shoot, and Nabi has a FUL (fire) bomb, with which he cannot do anything but throw. But Hawk, who is unarmed, can punch, kick, or let out a war cry (no idea what this does, but it seems to advance both fighter and priest skills), and Syra, with her axe, can either chop or cleave. Hence, when I click on the objects in the combat viewer, I get these associated options:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Swords can swing, thrust, or melee. Daggers can throw, stab, or slash. The Horn of Fear blows. The Mace of Order swings, bashes, or stuns (at least in theory; I've yet to get the stun to work). It's tough to know the best option. Certain attacks work better against certain creatures. Certain attacks take longer than others but do more damage. Since I'm usually trying to click through them quickly while taking damage, I find it hard to be precise.The option to throw objects is an interesting one. You can throw anything in the game--suits of armor, swords, food--and each item seems to do at least some damage the the creatures you hit. But equipping a proper missile weapon and throwing it through the combat options group seems to do more damage.Spellcasting is tough in combat because of the time it takes to look up the spell's run sequence and select the right runes. I have \"fireball\" memorized, and it casts fast; anything else, I'd better queue up ahead of time.The video below shows about six minutes of gameplay, including some combat with beholders and giant scorpions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As I begin, Nabi is poisoned from an earlier fight, and I'm trying to mix a cure poison potion to heal him. But the beholders get on my nerves, so at 00:12, I open up the gate, toss a fireball at them, and close the gate. I continue mixing the potion, but at 00:24, just as I'm having Nabi drink it, I hear the beholders open the gate themselves (I forgot they can cast \"open door\" spells). I close it, re-equip my weapon, and wipe them out with another fireball.At 00:48, I prepare some more fireballs and work my way through the dungeon. I encounter a giant scorpion at 01:11 and pound him with my prepared fireballs, but pretty soon I'm in melee combat. Leyla and Hawk (in the back ranks) shoot missile weapons while Syra and Nabi attack with an axe and a mace, respectively. Suddenly, at 01:34, with Nabi almost dead, I realize I'm being attacked by a second giant scorpion behind me. I dart off down a side passage and heal Nabi with moments to spare.At 02:19, it's time to get some more fireballs ready and finish off the bastards. I have Syra equip a magic freezing box and return to the battlefield. At 02:57, I stop the giant scorpion in his tracks and pummel him with missile and melee weapons. At 03:08, he dies. I cure my characters' poison again and then begin the long process of retrieving my missile weapons. They're not all here, which means some must be embedded in the other scorpion. I finish him off at 04:15 and pick everything up. After that, it's time for a brief save, some food, and a review of my equipment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attacked by a...pool of lava with tentacles?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I thought the scorpions were hard, but that was before I encountered the...whatever the hell this is...on Level 12. I'm still battling forward, though, and if my next posting isn't a \"won!\" posting, I'll be surprised."}, {"title": "Dungeon Master: Runic Magic", "date": "Monday, November 29, 2010", "text": "Level 9 down. Five to go!\u00a0I'm on the road again this week, this time in Charleston, South Carolina. This is significant because I love Charleston. It is especially nice this time of year, given that I normally live in Massachusetts. Nonetheless, I left the rooftop bar an hour ago so I could return to my hotel room and make this posting. This is what my CRPG addiction--and, to an equal extent, all of you--has reduced me to. I am also relatively intoxicated, so forgive me if this posting is riddled with errors and poor logic until I can correct them tomorrow.As some anonymous writer prophetically noted earlier today, Level 8 took me a long time, but more on that in a minute. I wanted to take some time to talk about Dungeon Master's unique use of runic magic.I reflected this week that if I was truly playing these games in chronological order, having never been exposed to CPRGs before, I would be noticing a lot of \"firsts\" that I'm am currently missing. I don't think any other game has featured a magic system like this one, although Ultima Underworld--sort-of a spiritual sequel to Dungeon Master--would famously adapt it. There are even elements of it in Ultima V (not yet played), in which each spell is a combination of syllables.The spell system in Dungeon Master is a system of 24 glyphs in four different \"tiers.\" I showed these in the first posting for the game, but I'll show them again here:Each spell begins with a specification of the spell's power, represented by the first \"tier.\" Some of the more basic spells, like \"magic torch,\" require only one further tier, while others, like \"lightning bolt,\" progress through all four. The power level determines the strength of the spell and the number of spell points that each glyph requires.A fireball launched at a death rat.You cast spells by queuing the glyphs in the spell section of the screen and then clicking the runes to actually cast them. The neat thing is that you can queue a certain spell long before actually casting it, so all four characters, for instance, can line up \"fireball\" spells and then wait for an appropriate enemy. Of course, if I decide I want to make some potions before an appropriate enemy comes along, I lose the spell points I invested in the \"fireball\" spell. Such is the gamble you take.Syra lines up a fireball spell.The difficulty associated with remembering each spell's glyph sequence and the time it takes to click on them make it difficult to actually cast them in combat. I've discovered that \"fireball\" is a relatively easy one, though, if I cast it at the EE potency level, since the glyphs EE, FUL, and IR, all occupy the same position in the sequence of glyphs. Casting it is four quick clicks.Discovering \"fireball\" was a major turning point. \"Fireball\" is really the major workhorse spell of any CRPG. I sense a \"special topics\" posting coming up soon.The game reveals its spells slowly, through scrolls that you find in different parts of the dungeon. Levels 6-9 really exploded the number of spells that I have available. I finally find OH EW RA (magic vision; sees through walls), which many of you have been hinting at for days, although I found it somewhat overwhelming and short-lived. FUL IR (fireball) and OH KATH RAH (lightning bolt) were great additions, since before them my only good offensive spells were DES VEN (poison) and OH VEN (poison cloud). I found FUL BRO NETA (fire shield) early on, but I forgot about its existence at a crucial point (see below). There are a whole host of spells that create potions to boost my stats, although I've yet to really use them. Plain old FUL (magic torch) remains a constant companion; I found another called OH IR RA (light), but I'm not sure how it differs. One, DES IR SAR (darkness), I've found no use for at all.The glyphs aren't meaningless, either. VI is a component of all healing spells, FUL shows up in fire-based spells, and EW seems to have to do with nonmaterial things, like DES EW (weakens nonmaterial beings) and OH EW RA (sees thorugh material things).I realized belatedly that nothing was stopping me from simply trying different glyph combos on my own, without waiting for the scrolls. But most of my attempts result in an error that I've \"mumbled a meaningless spell,\" so I suppose I'm better off waiting for the scrolls.Anything that results in a potion is a priest spell and everything else is a wizard spell. Spell points, which increase as I gain priest and wizard levels, regenerate fairly quickly. I've discovered that it's a bit of a waste to walk around with a full spell point reserve; even burning these casting needless extra \"magic torch\" spells or mixing unneeded healing potions helps me gain levels in those classes.Anyway, it's a unique magic system. It combines the \"spell memorization\" theme of Dungeons & Dragons games with the \"runic\" system of Ultima Underworld and the \"syllable\" system of Ultima V and the \"spell points\" system of The Bard's Tale while, of course, pre-dating most of these games.A magic barrier precluded progress on Level 7.So. Back to the gameplay. Since my last update, I have conquered Levels 8 and 9. Level 7 I had to bypass temporarily because I was missing a key to a locked door. A sign saying \"the key to the passage lies in hidden deep\" kept me from panicking and worrying that I'd overlooked it.Ghosts assailed me on Level 8. The only weapon that could defeat them was the vorpal blades I found on Level 6.Level 8 was mostly a vast cavern composed of ghosts that fell easily to my vorpal blades and thieves, which were the most annoying CRPG monsters I've ever faced.Gangly, larcenous bastards.They ran up behind me, making a chortling sound, and snatched anything I was carrying out of my hands. I had to chase them across the dungeon, swiping at them as soon as I got into range, to get my stuff back. Level 8 also featured random fireballs that kept hitting me out of nowhere. I never did figure out what was going on with those, although they eventually stopped for some reason.The cavernous Level 8.Level 9 was more of a traditional \"maze,\" with lots of dead ends and turns. There were hardly any puzzles on this one, although it featured some tough critters. Again, since the game doesn't name the monsters for me, I call them \"jawas,\" \"weird crawly things,\" and \"death rats.\" The rats were the toughest, swarming me two or three at a time.A jawa, sans the sandcrawler.A few stray observations:In the last posting, I showed an example of a button that was hard to see. These two levels featured even-harder-to-see buttons on certain walls. I think I got most of the secret doors because there isn't much blank space on my maps, but I can't be sure.This game does not reward myopic players.Level 9 had an area full of traps, where every square I stepped on tripped an unavoidable trap and launched a fireball from the other end of the room. I toughed my way through it, taking copious damage and healing my characters with potions, before I realized the \"fire shield\" spell would probably come in handy.Pelted with trap fireballs.There was one puzzle in which I had to find something \"lighter than a feather\" and stick it in an alcove. A rote process of trying all of my items determined that the solution was a chunk of \"corbomite.\" If there was anything in the game that taught me about corbomite's unusual weight properties, I missed it, but the mineral itself is a reference to Star Trek.There are more stairs on these lower levels than on the upper ones. Some staircases go to unexplored parts of upper and lower levels, but there also seems to be a central staircase starting on Level 6 that gives you quick access through the levels. Getting to it on each level involves finding a \"skeleton key\" and using it to open a secret door (helpfully distinguished by a skeleton head).The game makes a big deal about your characters needing to eat and drink, but frankly I've found nothing but copious amounts of food and water. I've been lugging around extra food (and chests to carry it) since Level 1, and I'm thinking about just dumping the chests in one of the central staircase levels so I don't have to lug around the weight. Unless something else happens late in the game, it doesn't look like I'll have any trouble returning to these storage locations. Honestly, if you're going to require characters to eat and drink, at least make it a little bit of a challenge.My characters remain quite sated.I'm showing you these maps because they take a long time to make and, dammit, someone is going to see them.There are five levels left to the game, I think, so I'll press on. Although this one is taking a while, it is clearly a seminal game in the development of CRPGs, and I'm grateful I was exposed to it."}, {"title": "Dungeon Master: Puzzles", "date": "Friday, November 26, 2010", "text": "I realized late in the level that I had misread the compass in the beginning. I ended up mapping the entire level upside-down.The levels are taking a bit longer in Dungeon Master, but I'm on the cusp of being halfway through the dungeon.Level 6 was a long and difficult experience, with tough monsters and interesting puzzles. A few postings ago, I faulted the game for lacking any real \"story,\" but it's starting to make up for that with other challenging gameplay elements.Coming down the stairs, I was greeted with a large room containing four small alcoves next to four inscriptions on the wall:\"I am all; I am none.\"\"Hard as rocks, blue as sky, twinkle in a woman's eye.\"\"I arch yet have no back.\"\"A golden head and tail but no body.\"2 and 4 I got almost immediately--a blue gem and a gold coin. #3 took me a minute of checking through my inventory before I hit on a bow. #1 I never got. I mean, I figured out the object by trying random items in my pack, but I don't know why that particular phrase corresponds to a \"Mirror of Dawn.\" Nonetheless, the solution opened an alcove containing a key as well as the exit to the room.I lost count of how many keys I picked up on the level--something like six. With only a couple of exceptions, each key opened a door to areas that were not strictly necessary to finish the level, but which contained treasures (including two vorpal swords, which I assume are pretty cool).I don't know what the one on the right is doing.But each key required solving a puzzle. Near the entry room was a crypt marked \"the grave of King Filius, explorer of combinations.\" The room contained four buttons which I had to press in a particular order to open a secret door. With no clue as to the order, I simply had to write out each possibility (1234, 2341, 4123, etc.) and cross them off one by one until I figured it out.Next to Filus's grave was the grave of \"King Milias the Golden, who even in death searches for bullion.\" A gold coin dropped into a slot in the wall opened that one.There were several puzzles involving pressure plates--mostly having to throw objects onto the right ones. One kept me occupied for a long time. It seemed simple enough: the plate opened a nearby wall. But none of my items would trigger the plate; I had to be standing on it. After a long while trying to figure something out, I hit upon the solution of having monsters stand on it--there were plenty of respawning skeletons nearby. But wouldn't you know it--they wouldn't stand still long enough for me to run through the door. So after a period so long I'm not entirely comfortable admitting it, I remembered I had a number of magic boxes that would freeze enemies in place for a spell. That victory tasted sweet.The critters on the level were reasonably difficult. There were three new monster types: beholders (that's what I'm calling them anyway; the game doesn't tell you their names), skeletons, and giant bees. The skeletons weren't too much trouble except in one place where they trapped me in a corner and attacked me in waves. Beholders were medium difficulty, pummeling me with spells but falling fairly quickly to my weapons. The giant bees kicked my ass, wiping out my entire party twice. I had to resort to firing poison spells while rapidly retreating down the corridor. Fortunately, there weren't many of them.One wonders where giant bees find pollen in the depths of a dungeon.In other news:I've done a good job balancing out my character levels. Each of my four characters is at least a \"craftsman\" (fifth level) in each class. The more I play, the more I like the skill-based development system.Back when I was writing about Shard of Spring, I noted that there weren't many games that allowed you to adjust the power of spells. Here's one that does. The first rune that you speak in each spell determines its potency.This level didn't have any walls to walk through, but it did have plenty of tiny hidden buttons. These are virtually impossible to see from the side, so you have to turn and face every wall.This is where a hobbit character would come in handy.The not-knowing-how-to-evaluate-weapons-and-armor thing is getting more difficult. I found a lot of new stuff on this level, and I'm just making guesses about what's best. Y'all keep suggesting that I cheat on this point, and I admit I'm sorely tempted. So out of curiosity, if I did want to give in and look up weapons and armor on a table or something, does one exist? If so, how did the author figure it out? It's not like the weapons do a consistent amount of damage every time you strike.Yay! A mail aketon! Unless that's worse than an Elvin doublet. In which case, boo!I know this is a weird time to say this, but it occurred to me today that the graphics are quite good in Dungeon Master--perhaps even the best of any CRPG I've played so far. You can't see it in the screenshots, of course, but the monsters are animated, and the designers took the time to work in neat little touches like shadows. If only the dungeons had some variety to their textures--but I suppose that since the dungeon was supposed to have been one man's house, it makes sense that they don't.I'll think about recording some video for my next posting."}, {"title": "Gobble, Gobble", "date": "Thursday, November 25, 2010", "text": "Source: The Onion, of course.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Night had fallen in the dungeon of Anaias.

I apologize for that. I'm feeling a little better about Dungeon Master tonight. When you're tired, even the most rote of games can feel like an effort, and nothing is very fun.Though I'm not as annoyed with the game as on Monday, I didn't make much progress tonight despite playing for several hours. Still on Level 5, I first got caught up in a series of teleportation fields and had to find my way through them through trial and error. I did notice one neat thing: I don't actually have to \"look\" at the compass in my inventory to see the direction; instead, the icon actually changes to point towards north. That's pretty nifty.After finishing the level, I decided to head back up to Level 4, return to the room with the constantly-respawning mushroom creatures, and camp out there to build up my characters' levels. Reader Georges left a good comment a few days ago about the importance of training all characters in all levels. Leyla had no spellcasting levels; Hawk had no ninja level; and Nabi had no fighter level. All of the characters, whether they had levels or not, were imbalanced in some way.Leyla still lacks a priest level. Hence, the potion jar in her hand.The game deserves more credit than I've been giving it when it comes to its skill-based leveling system. It is fairly rewarding, and in many ways, it anticipates the more complex systems in The Elder Scrolls games. To increase levels in a class, you have to use its associated skills a certain number of times. The higher the level, the more experience you need to advance.I'm not completely sure what all the skills and actions are that contribute to each level, but from what I can tell so far:You improve your ninja score when you fight without weapons and throw thingsYou improve your fighter score when you fight with weapons, get hit, and use a skill called \"war cry\" that, as far as I can tell, does nothing but make your character yell \"yah!\"Priest levels advance by mixing potionsWizard levels advance by casting spellsRear characters can't attack directly or get hit, so I'm learning the importance of occasionally rotating the characters to give everyone some experience in melee. Reader John helped me realize belatedly how I could improve spellcasting skills even in a character with hardly any spell points.Unfortunately, my plan backfired a bit, and I managed to get myself stuck in a corridor/stairs area with two giant worms at one end and a flying lizard thing at the other. Neither shows any desire to just go away, and all my characters are low on spell points and health. If I stand still, they come and get me. If I engage them, I die. Regrettably, I saved in this location, so I keep reloading, trying to defeat one or the other, dying, and reloading. I'm sure I'll get past them sooner or later.Thus, sorry for the short posting, but I didn't want to go three days, and I don't have anything else to report after two. I might take a detour into Faery Tale Adventure tomorrow, or I might stick with this, depending on my mood and whether I can get past the worms (suggestions welcome). Thanks for hanging in there with me."}, {"title": "Dungeon Master: Back in the Dungeon Again", "date": "Sunday, November 21, 2010", "text": "I owe my life to a relentless door closing mechanism. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Here's an important lesson learned for the month of November: I cannot play multiple games over the course of a week, offering at least one, sometimes two, postings per day, without getting so far behind in my work that I have to swear off CRPGs for an entire week just to catch up. I suspect that my regular readers--if I still have any left--would prefer a moderate pace of one posting every two days to this feast-or-famine trap I seem to have fallen into.Getting back into Dungeon Master after a week off was tough, but it was even tougher coming up with enough material to make a blog posting. What did I say about the game a week ago? \"Pretty awesome?\" It's amazing how fast one's opinion can change. Somewhere in the midst of mapping Level 4 or 5, I realized that this was probably as good as it was going to get. If five levels haven't offered me any NPCs, plot points, interesting vistas, big bosses, or puzzles involving anything more advanced than a pressure plate, probably the next five aren't, either. It's taking me about 3-4 hours per level, but getting a little longer on each one. Based on trudodyr's depressing revelation last week that the dungeon has 14 levels, I suspect I have another--ulp--30-40 hours of gameplay left on this one.This is the problem with Dungeon Master: it's all style and no substance; an endless slog through the same corridors fighting the same monsters. From a gameplay perspective, it's great; I only wish this engine had been used by Might & Magic or even Wizardry. From an RPG perspective, it's...well, barely an RPG. Granted, Wizardry didn't have a lot of story to it, either, but at least it had the decency to be only 10 levels, and about half the size of Dungeon Master's labyrinths.Another huge level down.All right. Enough whining. Let's get to the new stuff.In the comments to my first posting, reader tekeli-li told me about something that I can't decide whether it's a \"feature\" or a \"bug\" in the game: if you lure monsters into doorways and press the \"close door\" switch, the door keeps bashing down on them until they die or flee. If you keep attacking the monsters while this is happening, they don't last very long. When I first read the comment, I thought it was an amusing little diversion that I probably wouldn't use much, so as not to rob my characters of the skill bonuses associated with killing monsters. Well, little did I know. Without the door-closing trick, I never would have made it through the endless armies of giant worms on Level 4. My characters still haven't recovered from that experience.The tactics of combat and magic have forced a revision of how I see my characters. I was regarding my first character, Leyla, as primarily a ninja, and giving her lots of stuff to throw when enemies first appear. But once the enemies close in, it took too long to switch to melee weapons. So now I'm trying to develop the ninja levels of my two rear characters and the spellcasting levels of my two forward ones. Based on the comments I'm receiving, though, I pretty much need to regard all the characters as generalists and have each of them get levels in all four classes.The only way we know how to look for secret doors is bash face-first into the wall. I picture the monsters laughing at me.Secret doors continue to annoy me a bit. I'm paranoid about missing them, so I've taken to bashing every wall--my characters taking damage while doing so--just to make sure there isn't one there.Leyla reacts predictably to a giant worm's bite.Happily, Dungeon Master defies the conventions of most CRPGs by refusing to include poison. No! Just kidding! Wouldn't that be disappointing? Actually, pretty much everything poisons my characters starting on Level 4: worms, flying snake things, the occasional trap. Curing it involves mixing up a batch of antidote which, to be fair, increases my character's priest skills, so it's not all bad--just a bit annoying, as poison always is.Ah, the fabled Ekkhard Cross.The biggest annoyance in the game continues to be a lack of information about the different pieces of equipment I find. It was bad enough when I had to try to figure out the relative merit of different weapons and armor, but now I'm finding magic items--or, at least, what I think are magic items--such as an \"Ekkhard Cross\" and a \"Gem of Ages.\" If you look at the screen shot above, the game provides you a way to look at your items and get information about them, but all you learn is the name and the weight. What does it do? There's a whole bunch of blank space under the weight where they could put this information, but they don't. I just have to stick it on a random character and hope it does something. This is pretty much unforgivable.Cleaning up after a kill.Missile weapons are pretty useful, but picking up missile weapons after hurling them all in combat is getting pretty annoying. You have to click on each item on the ground, then open the character portrait, stick the item in the proper inventory slot, close the character portrait, and pick up the next item.Dungeon Master, I should mention, features missile weapons like bows and slings, but it also requires you to have associated ammunition. Games are divided on this issue. The Might & Magic folks just assume you can pick up arrows anywhere, I guess, and thus provide you with unlimited ammo. In Baldur's Gate, you can buy 40 arrows for a single gold piece and yet you still have to buy them. Ultima doesn't track arrows; The Elder Scrolls does. It's a trade-off between realism and avoiding the annoyance of inventory micromanagement. I can't say for sure what side I fall on.I don't fall on the side of Dungeon Master, which requires you to have ammunition but only gives you five slots to hold it and doesn't stack like objects. That means each character can shoot or throw only five times before having to go pick up his stuff or switch to a melee weapon. Any realism it gains by doing this, it sacrifices by having your ammo never break; all arrows are re-usable.And that's about the size of it. Here's me fighting some sort of reaper or something:We must always be conscious of the effects of our moods on our enjoyment of things. I've been up for close to 30 hours straight and played my last round of Dungeon Master after writing 20 pages on the differences between ethnography and phenomenology. It's possible that tomorrow, in a refreshed mood, the game will regain its former level of addiction and enjoyment. If not, I may take a detour to Faery Tale Adventure, but have no fear: I shall finish Dungeon Master simply because it seems like a game that a CRPG addict ought to finish."}, {"title": "Dungeon Master: Level 3", "date": "Saturday, November 13, 2010", "text": "The party fails to work together as a team.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Another level of Dungeon Master is behind me. As some of you predicted, it was a bit more difficult than Level 2, although images like the one above were mercifully rare. There were more \"puzzles\" on this level involving hidden switches, pressure plates, secret doors, and teleporters. The only one that really taxed me involved a door on the other side of a pit. The solution was to cast an \"open\" spell on the door, then throw an item into the darkness beyond it. The item landed on a pressure plate, closing the pit. It took me a while because I had overlooked the fact that I had a scroll with the \"open\" spell on it.Long ago, in a woefully overlooked posting, I waxed about the magic systems in different games. My thesis was that while combat and such tend to be familiar from game to game, magic systems are characterized by several dimensions: how you acquire spells, the limits on the spells you can cast, how you regenerate your spell powers, how you access your spells, how the spells are divided by category or class, and so on. From Ultima V's reagent-and-syllable based system to Dungeons & Dragons scribe-and-memorize method to The Elder Scrolls' skill-and-mana model, every game seems to feature a slightly different spell system.Dungeon Master is no exception, and its spell system is even more unusual than most. First, any character can cast any spell, provided he or she has the requisite spell power. The neat thing about the game is that you don't define your characters as \"fighters\" or \"wizards\" at the outset; rather, your characters become fighters or wizards (or both) depending on whether they cast spells. This confused me at first, but it's essentially just an early version of the skill-based system that The Elder Scrolls games use. In Morrowind, for instance, you can define your character as a \"knight\" at the beginning of the game, but that doesn't stop you from channeling your efforts into arcane or priestly spells and becoming an archmage by the end of the game. So one of my characters, Hawk, started out as a fighter, but eventually has developed basic priest levels by repeatedly mixing potions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Nabi prepares to cast a spell to make a healing potion. Note the empty flask in his inventory.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To cast a spell, you have to string together a valid set of runes in a special section of the screen (where the cursor is in the image above). The first rune indicates the power of the spell (and thus how many magic points it requires); the rest specify the spell. Theoretically, I guess, you could cast every spell in the game right from the beginning, but the problem is, you don't know what they are. Only by finding scrolls with messages like \"Cast VI BRO to cure poison\" do you acquire this knowledge. So far, I've found light, healing (the spell requires a flask and creates a potion; I don't know if there's a non-potion healing spell, too), cure poison, poison, something that \"weakens nonmaterial beings,\" stamina, and open door.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Syra hits a monster in the face with a DES VEN (poison).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Offensive spells are going to be a bit of a problem, I can tell. Because combat is in real time, and it's hard to remember what symbol corresponds with what rune, it takes me 10 seconds or so to string together each spell. That's too long to be standing around getting pummeled by monsters. The game lets you prepare spells ahead of time and \"hold\" them in the spell box, so the only offensive spells I've used are ones that I've put together before I approach the monsters. Then I let the spells fly and try to finish off the combat the old fashioned way.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 You keep on trying, kid.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Each rune you add to the spell box (each syllable you speak, in the game's parlance) costs a little bit of mana. If you make a mistake, you can backspace and delete the syllable, but you don't get the mana back. I don't know for sure if you gain skill points by simply speaking the syllables or if you actually have to cast a valid spell. If the latter, I'm not sure if my ninja character, Leyla, will ever gain any spellcaster levels, as she doesn't have enough mana to cast even the most basic spells.So that's the magic system. Let me cover some of the other miscellaneous things I discovered during my Level 3 gameplay:I found a compass in a secret area on the level, well after I had completed most of the map in the wrong orientation. While it's nice to know where north is, the compass doesn't tell you your relative position in the map, so its utility is somewhat limited. I suppose it will help a little on spinners, which I encountered on this level. I'm not a fan of spinners.Fighting \"debris-creatures\"Unless I'm missing something (I probably am), there's no way to know the names of monsters I'm fighting. It makes it hard to describe them. On this level, I faced mummies (that was obvious from the bandages), some kind of blue goblin-looking monsters, and these insidious creatures that looked like piles of debris from a distance. They were hard to kill but slow, so I could back off and toss all of my missile weapons at them.Three goblinish things attack me from the right.In the upper-right corner of the game screen, you see the formation of the characters. The color-coding on the little pictures corresponds with the colors in each character's status bar on the top. Being color-blind, I can't really tell the difference, but memorizing the positions of four characters isn't a big problem. Only the two characters in the front of the formation can attack with melee weapons, but I can swap who's in front and who's in back at any time. What I noticed tonight is that monsters adhere to this 4 x 4 formation, too. Check the screen shot above, and note that the monsters aren't using the left slots. This means that if Leyla tosses a missile weapon right now, it will sail harmlessly down the hallway.The game is relatively slow to give up its treasures. Each level has only a few caches of treasure, and rarely do I find a weapon or armor that seems better than what I already own. I say \"seems better,\" but it's actually hard to tell, as the game doesn't tell me the damage done by weapons or the protection afforded by armor. (Is a sabre better than a falchion? How does a leather jerkin compare to an Elven doublet?) This is one of only two major complaints I have about the game.A nearly-missed switch to a secret door.My second complaint has to do with secret doors. From what I can tell so far, there are two types: those activated by hidden switches, and those that I just walk through. The switch ones are cool. I have to watch carefully for changes in the pattern on walls and make sure I don't miss them, but this is a perfectly valid gameplay element. The ones that I walk through, on the other hand, are a pain in the ass. Since my characters take damage from just walking into walls, it's impractical to bump into every wall to see if there's a secret door behind. It would be too time consuming even if I didn't take any damage. But there's functionally no other way to find them. I found one on Level 3, but I'm guessing I probably missed others on this and previous levels.Hawk comes back to us.My rules about saving and reloading make the game a bit time-consuming. Every time a character dies (provided the whole party doesn't die), I have to haul his or bones to a resurrection altar, then return to the place of death to pick up his or her equipment. There was an altar on Level 1 and another on Level 3, so I hope they continue to keep coming every other level. Adhering to my rules does make combat a bit suspenseful, as I have a lot of incentive not to die.Sometimes, I'm finding, the best thing to do is run from combat and regroup at a safe distance, drinking some healing potions, preparing some spells, and lining up missile weapons. This keeps me spatially aware more than most games: I need to know the best path of retreat.Hawk needs to take a load off.Encumbrance matters. The more weight my characters carry, the slower I move through the dungeon. This became a problem in one section of Level 3 in which I had to press a button that opened a secret door, then race down the corridor before the door closed. It was several frustrated attempts before I realized I needed to abandon some of my stuff so I could run faster.I haven't figured out yet if monsters respawn. If they do, they do slowly.I realized just tonight that there's no economy in this game. The characters don't have a cache of gold pieces, and there's no place to buy or sell weapons and armor. I have found a few stray coins, but these are solutions to puzzles, not something I can use at shops.Three levels down...I actually have no idea how many there are to go.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In case it's not obvious from my coverage, Dungeon Master is a pretty awesome game. Its potential for ruining my life over the next couple of weeks is nontrivial. In my first post for this blog, I told the story of how I nearly gave up CRPGs for good:My wife went out of town for a three-day business meeting, and I had  planned to use the time to finish editing a book that I'd promised to  the publisher a couple of weeks prior. The first morning, I worked maybe  an hour on it before deciding to take a break for a \"little\" bit of Oblivion. 72 hours later, when my wife returned, I had done essentially nothing else.Well, here we are, a year later, and my wife is out of town for another three-day meeting--for the same purpose as last year--and I have the same sort of major work project overdue. If you see another posting about Dungeon Master on this blog before Sunday night, I expect you all to yell at me."}, {"title": "A Quick Vote", "date": "Friday, November 12, 2010", "text": "So I did something different this last week by playing more than one game at once. I don't know why it hasn't occurred to me before. Obviously, one-game-at-a-time is my preferred modus operandi, but if it had occurred to me to take a break and go on to a different game temporarily, I might have stuck with Wizardry IV, Swords of Glass, and a few other games in the past.Is toggling between a couple games a good idea when I get bored, stuck, or frustrated, or does it ruin the immersion? Use the \"reactions\" boxes below to give me your vote:\"Good\" means: \"Yes, by all means, play a couple games at once if it means you're more likely to finish them.\"\"Bad\" means: \"No, I prefer you stick to one game at a time and either finish it or move on before starting another.\"\"Meh\" means: \"I'm the kind of person that hangs out in /r/apathy. I don't even know why I'm voting.\"Don't be a jackass and vote more than once even though the blog will let you.Any substantive comments welcome, too.There will be another Dungeon Master post when I get done with Level 3, probably tomorrow.Don't try to fight fire with fire: A life lesson from Beyond ZorkLet's get this out of the way at the outset: Beyond Zork is not a CRPG. It's a text adventure with some CRPG elements attached. I probably should have rejected it for this blog on dogmatic grounds. On the other hand, I had an awful lot of fun playing it, and solving the puzzles (mostly) without help was an ego-booster. I also added two new words--burin and palimpsest--to my vocabulary.Nonetheless, I'm going to rank this as a CRPG. For the uninitiated, I use the GIMLET scale (described here) for the scoring.1. Game World. Small and goofy. The landscape, features, and people serve the puzzles and plot, not any sensible order. The jungle, gondola ride, platypus castle, war between Borphee and Pheebor, and so on are all part of the fun, but they obviously don't go together. They also don't fit terribly well with the lore established in the game's backstory. It's not  supposed to be a good CRPG game world, but then again, check the title of the blog. However, unlike many actual CRPGs of the era, the game remembers your actions, and your actions have consequences for the world. Final score: 5.2. Character Creation and Development. Most text adventures don't have this at all, and it's only Beyond Zork's small nods in this area that even begin to qualify it as a CRPG. You can choose from several existing characters or make your own, assigning a name, sex, and five attributes. As you defeat monsters, you rise in level and thus endurance, and your other attributes increase with various items, potions, and spells. Higher scores allow you to solve or shortcut puzzles, so your stats do matter even if your sex doesn't. The limited game world means development is limited, but it's still better than some early CRPGs. Final score: 4.It's nontraditional character development, but it's character development.3. NPC Interaction. There aren't many NPCs in the game world, but they are all memorable, from the crusty old sailor to the conniving cook to the pontificating Cardinal Toolbox. You do have to interact with them to advance in the game world, and they have honestly interesting things to say. Moreover, the parser, which allows you address them directly (SAILOR, HELLO!), ask questions (ASK COOK ABOUT ONION), and give commands (TOOLBOX, GIVE ME THE RELIQUARY) is about as open-ended as dialog choices get. There aren't really \"role playing\" options here, but it's still very enjoyable. Final score: 7.4. Encounters & Foes. My GIMLET scale wants \"unique monsters.\" Folks, I give you monkey grinders, cruel puppets, lucksuckers, Christmas Tree Monsters, and of course grues. These monsters are not only thoroughly described in the manual; the manual gives you clues about their weaknesses and the means needed to defeat them. There are even role-playing options with some of them, allowing you to defeat them with cleverness, compassion, or brute force. Many of them, of course, you do not fight in traditional CRPG style, all the encounters are essentially scripted, and the monsters do not respawn once defeated; your experience rewards are limited. Final score: 8.After three games of being menaced by grues every time your lantern goes out, you actually get to kill three of them in this game. That alone is worth it.5. Magic & Combat. Combat is very basic in the game, consisting of typing attack commands and hoping to score a hit based on your attributes and luck. Magic is through scrolls, potions, and wands, and mostly geared towards specific puzzles, although you have a lot of flexibility in how you use some of them. There are no real \"tactics\" to combat, though. Final score: 3.6. Equipment. Like most adventure games, you have a wide variety of items in Beyond Zork, most needed to solve puzzles, but some (sword, plate mail, cloak) just to make life easier. You can gauge relative worth of the equipment from its value, and each item is fairly well described with the EXAMINE command. Some key plot items are always found in the same place, but many of the magic items are randomized within the game world, making each game a slightly different experience. Beyond Zork is unique in that it lets you give your own names to your weapons and animal companions. Final score: 6.7. Economy. You don't get any cash for killing creatures, but there are a number of treasures that serve no purpose except to sell them, and you can always sell expended magic items and used plot items. It's worth doing this so you can save for your suit of plate armor, cloak, and sword, as well as one major plot item (the hourglass). Towards the end of the game, though, money stops serving any purpose, and in general the monetary system is more of an afterthought than an integral part of the game. Final score: 3.8. Quests. There is only one \"quest,\" although with many puzzles, and it is introduced in a very strange manner, more than halfway through the game, via a circumstance that you create. Until this happens, it's hard to know what your character's motivation is except \"because it's there.\" As far as I can tell, there's only one outcome to the main quest, and it doesn't really follow from the quest itself (i.e., the Implementors give you the quest, and you never see them again). Final score: 2.9. Graphics, Sound, and Inputs. Well, it's a text adventure, so we don't really look for graphics and sound. (Sound consists of an occasional beep when your stats go up or down.) The text-based controls do work quite well, though, with the game recognizing most words that you would think to type in any given situation. Final score: 3.10. Gameplay. Gameplay toes the line between linear and nonlinear. The world is fairly small, and most of time spent in the game comes from solving puzzles, not exploring the world. Within the limited world, you have general freedom as to what order you do things. It isn't replayable at all, but it does offer the right challenge level--just frustrating enough at times to, well, make you detour to another game for a little while, but not so frustrating that you give up in despair. I thought its level was almost perfect. I'm surprised I was able to complete it without any major hints, although if it was just a little more frustrating, I probably would have succumbed. Final score: 5.Final score: 46. The little non-CRPG gets a higher score than any CRPG I've played except Ultima III, Ultima IV, Starflight, and Might & Magic. I'm on board with that 100%. If this wasn't supposed to be a blog about CRPGs, I could give it additional points for its sense of humor and quality of writing.I maintain this was a good inclusion in the list. Barton notes that Beyond Zork was a unique hybrid: \"no other major developers have been willing to revisit the design\" (p. 259). As such, it was worth exploring and archiving. I'm ready to get back to slaughtering legions of goblins, though, and I won't miss all the typing.Think if I tried again, I could do it in fewer moves?Well, with your help (particularly that of Jason Dyer, who--ahem--knows what he's talking about before he tells me puzzles are \"easy\"), I won Beyond Zork: The Coconut of Quendor. Damn, that was a tough one.When I last checked in, I was struggling to figure out what to do at an iridescent dome, how to permanently defeat the Chistmas Tree Monsters, and how to get past the corbies in the Fields of Frotzen. The dome I figured out mostly through brute force: I tried every object at it, before I finally destroyed it with the wand of dispel. The dome turned out to be holding back a volcano, and the result was memorable:A vortex of energy forms at the tip of the Dispel wand, reaches outward and envelops the iridescent dome in a swirling haze. You watch as it spreads across the perimeter, patiently undoing the mystic forces that define its structure.Kerblam! The mountain roars with volcanic triumph as a thousand years of pent-up fury breaches the bonds of Time. A plume of white-hot lava swells up from the heart of the mountain, only seconds away from where you stand!After outrunning the lava, which filled the valley, I waited for it to cool a bit and then inscribed the Christmas Tree Monster-repelling glyph in it with the burin. That permanently saved the day. The mayor of Thriff, Cardinal Toolbox, gave me his reliquary as a reward. This turned out to contain a white hemisphere that, when joined with the black hemisphere I picked up in the cabin, created a gray sphere called the Scrystone of Prosser.Now, at this point I was all excited because I thought the corbies feared the color gray. You see, in the Fields of Frotzen there are three scarecrows, two guarding devastated fields and one guarding a thriving one where the corbies were terrified rather than enraged. I noted that the scarecrow guarding the thriving field was wearing gray clothing, so I figured with my gray sphere I could scare the corbies off.Nothing doing. It turns out all of the scarecrows were wearing gray. However, my idea wasn't so far from the truth. Again, I just hung around the working scarecrow, trying all of my items, until I realized that the hurdy-gurdy, when set on the \"eye\" setting, renders colors more vivid. I was able to tell that the scarecrow was actually wearing mauve. Shortly thereafter, a farm house came spinning out of a tornado, and when I entered it, I found myself swept up to the Land of Froon.It's not a copyright violation if it's in the public domain.My arrival crushed a tyrant called the Heeled One, which was basically a giant boot. In reward, the Mayor of Froon let me choose from a selection of colored keys. I picked the mauve one. When I returned to the real world, I used it to get by the corbies and pick the Compass Rose, a magical flower that not only tells which way the wind is blowing but actually changes it.With the Compass Rose, I was finally able to reach the castle on the back of the pterodactyl. (This entire posting is starting to sound like I'm describing a bad acid trip.) The castle is the home of a platypus princess (yeah, it's getting worse) who had a magic jar with a wand that blows bubbles, but the bubbles take the form of a mirror. I managed to snatch that.Then came a time in which I didn't have any more puzzles to solve, but I couldn't figure out what to do. Finally, I thought to look inside the Scrystone of Prosser, which showed me a man using a magic word to open a concealed door in a wall. I knew the locations of two walls and both had concealed doors which led to the same network of caves. Unfortunately, something kept breaking my lantern. Navigating through the caves involved blowing a series of mirror-bubbles to angle sunlight from the outside.I was attacked by a \"lucksucker\" who killed me a few times before I realized I had to defeat him by throwing my various good luck charms--a horseshoe, a four-leaf clover, and a rabbit's foot--at him. Ultimately, I reached the cave of the ur-grue, who I exposed by angling the sunlight at his corner of the cave.The ur-grue took the form of an old man. Actually, I got the impression that the ur-grue was just a wizard possessing a grue or something:  In the corner lies a feeble old man, bent with grief. His robes are tattered, his white hair scorched by flame. You slowly rise and draw closer, bending low to touch his shoulder. Snap! Ten bony fingers clamp around your throat! \"I can always count on fools like you for sympathy,\" chuckles the not-so-feeble old man as he holds your windpipe shut. \"Still, though your mind is weak, your body is young and strong. It will make a suitable vessel until I can find another grue.\" He grabs your hair, pulls your head back and directs your eyes into his own. \"Relax. This won't hurt a bit.\"His method of attack involved sucking away my compassion, but it turns out I had too much of it (so that's what it does) so he gave up and took off. From his treasure pile, I retrieved the Coconut of Quendor, and members of the Enchanter's Guild retrieved me for the end game.It turns out that the various \"NPCs\" in the game--the old woman running the shops, the sailor painting the canvas, the cook in the tavern, and Cardinal Toolbox--are all enchanters subtly helping me to solve the quest, although this is odd as the main quest didn't even begin until I visited the Implementors. Nonetheless, the game ended by promoting me to a \"Level 0 novice\" (I had been a \"peasant\" before that) and promising me more adventures to come.Alas, none of the later Zorks seem to continue this storyline, so it appears we've left Quendor for good. We've also left the Zork series for good, as none of the later games even pretend to have RPG elements. I can't pretend I won't sneak in a trip to Zork Zero anyway, though.Taking a video of a text game seemed silly, so what I did--for some reason--is replay the entire game. Knowing the puzzle solutions made it go pretty fast. During the replay, I turned scripting on, so if you want an account of the entire game, click here to read it. I think it's worth sampling just for the quality of the language. I didn't just blow through it on the replay, either; I tried to get as many of the descriptions and jokes into the script as possible.Final ranking to come later, perhaps with an intervening Dungeon Master posting."}, {"title": "Dungeon Master: Level 2", "date": "Thursday, November 11, 2010", "text": "Is this an example of the liar paradox?It's been a productive day. And when I say \"productive day,\" I don't mean in any real sense, like I made any progress on my dissertation or installed my new sink or graded any of the 30 papers I have to grade. No, I mean \"productive\" as in I won Beyond Zork and got through the second level of Dungeon Master. So, you know, in the stuff that matters.The Beyond Zork posting will have to wait until tomorrow because I plan to replay the entire game now that I know all the puzzles. I want to try out a few different things and record a master script of my gameplay.I have less to say about Dungeon Master. Exploring Level 2 of the dungeon served the dual purpose of advancing the game and teaching me more about how the game works. I discovered:The levels in Dungeon Master are quite large. I think Level 2 was 33 x 33, compared to 16 x 16 for Might & Magic and 20 x 20 for the Wizardry series. It's not quite as large as it sounds because unlike the other games, corridors do not share the same walls; there's always a bit of space in between them, as you can see from my partial map below.Ultimately, I stopped mapping, partly because the level was very linear--there were many locked gates you couldn't get through until you found a specific key or switch in a previous part of the dungeon--party because switching from the game (which uses the mouse) to the Excel map was a bit of a pain, and partly because I just didn't feel like it. I imagine I'll have to pick up mapping again on later levels.There were a few light puzzles on Level 2, one involving a series of pressure plates that I had to hit in the right order to open some gates, and a couple others involving dropping objects on pressure plates. Nothing too difficult so far.Pressure plates  on the floor.As I mentioned, getting through this level involved finding a series of keys to open various doors and gates. Some of them were very hard to see against the dungeon floor. The CRPG Addict is color-blind, which might have something to do with it, or it could be just bad game design.If you accidentally walk into a wall, your lead characters take a hit point or two of damage. Seriously? My characters are so dumb they go charging into solid walls?I found a couple of chests. It took me a while before I realized I could take the chests and use them to increase my inventory slots. Right now, I have lots and lots of food items that my characters don't need, but I have a sneaking suspicion food will be less plentiful on lower levels.Hawk stores his bread and mushrooms.You see  your way through the dark through either a \"magic torch\" spell or actual torches. At the level I can cast right now, the actual torches are brighter. The neat thing is that they don't just burn for a while and then fizzle out; they get darker as time passes.You can bash some doors.This is always satisfying.There are a lot of things that look like hooks on various walls. I can't seem to manipulate them in any way, so I assume they're just decoration. If not, I've been missing a lot of stuff.The only thing that makes me really nervous is that I'm not sure how secret doors are found in this game. I hope I didn't miss a bunch on this level.Menaced by mummies.For combat, the characters can arm themselves with either melee weapons or throwing weapons. There are several \"waiting slots\" for throwing weapons, so when one is hurled, the next one pops into the character's hands. On this level, I encountered a lot of mummies and...I don't know...giant fungi, I guess. My strategy was to hang back when I could and exhaust my throwing weapons (you can pick them up again later), then let them come to me for the melee.Leyla's arrows, shurikens, and knives await her deft wrists.During combat, I had a few messages to the extent that \"so-and-so has gained a fighter level.\" Dungeon Master does not follow the traditional experience-based CRPG leveling system. Rather, as you use your skills, you advance in levels for each class. Melee weapons are a fighter skill, throwing weapons a ninja skill, and magic skills are divided between the priest and wizard classes. Leyla started out as a journeyman ninja, but along the way she also became a \"neophyte fighter\" because she developed her melee skills. It seems the class levels go: neophyte, novice, apprentice, journeyman. I'm not sure what the levels are called after that.Leyla's swinging pays off.The interesting thing is that leveling comes regardless of whether you kill the monster, or even fight a monster at all--every time you throw something or swing a weapon, you slightly increase the associated skill. The same goes for spells, whether successful or not. While I like skill-based systems (The Elder Scrolls series is famous for it), it seems like this opens things up for a lot of abuse. I could stand in a corner and just swing my way to expert fighter status or something. On the other hand, this seems boring and I probably won't do it, so perhaps the potential for abuse is limited.Leyla shuffles off the mortal coil.I did die a couple of times. If one character dies, he or she turns into a pile of bones, and you can resurrect him or her in a special alcove on Level 1 (I don't know if there are more throughout the dungeon). If all characters die, you get a \"The End\" screen and that's that. This happened to me once.The pacing in Dungeon Master is pretty good, although I suspect it will slow down once I have to take mapping seriously again. I don't know how many levels there are to the dungeon, but as of now, this strikes me as a game to play to the end.Next up: the final Beyond Zork postings and then a review of Dungeon Master's magic system.On to Level 3.Yes, last night I said my next posting would be on Dungeon Master, but I had a two and a half hour car ride this morning, and I used some of that time to think about Beyond Zork. Zink chided me last night, saying the caterpillar/butterfly riddle was \"SIMPLE!\" Yes, naturally a caterpillar is an earlier version of a butterfly. So what? How do I make a butterfly regress to the caterpillar stage? I messed around with the hourglass for what seemed like hours to no avail.During the drive, though, I remembered that the hurdy-gurdy had a clock setting. What I had never noticed is that it also has a \"lid,\" meaning I can open it and put something in it. I stuck the butterfly in it, turned the dial to the clock setting, cranked the handle to the left, and sure enough, the butterfly, regressed into a caterpillar. Wow. I'm glad I solved the puzzle and everything, but wouldn't it have been a lot easier just to head into the forest and find a freaking caterpillar?!With the caterpillar, newly dubbed, firmly in my possession, the Christmas Tree Monsters hustled out of my way and a new area opened up to me.The Christmas Tree Monsters sing grotesque versions of Christmas carols. The game is really quite clever with this.My biggest revelation in the car, however, concerned the truffle. I reflected that I had:A minx capable of sniffing out and digging up trufflesA truffle which, thanks to the magic of the Pool of Eternal Youth, would last foreverA spadeAn hourglass that probably has something to do with turning back timeIt seemed rather obvious to me that there would be something whose location I would want to mark in a visit to the past so that my minx could find it in the present. And the only place I could imagine this happening was in the ruins of Pheebor. So I messed around there for a while and while examining an arch in the ruins, found that \"the opening beneath is shaped like an hourglass.\" Well, hell. Entering the arch, I turned the hourglass and found myself in a corridor that allowed me to go backward and forwards in time. Suddenly realizing I'd forgotten to bring my minx, who was presumably required for my idea, and I had to go back and get him.Long story short: I came across the site of a battle between the nations of Pheebor and Borphee (the war was apparently over the right to name the river). The prince of Pheebor had his head lopped off by a black knight. The game kept emphasizing the prince's helmet. I couldn't take the helmet in the past, so I tossed the truffle into the trench where it lay, returned to the present--actually, I think I ultimately went to the future, where more of the topsoil had been eroded away--and Skavenhorde found the helmet, which increased my intelligence and armor class. This took a long time of messing about.Afterwards, I took a chance that I was done with the hourglass, sold it, and had enough cash for some decent armor, on which I could use a scroll of protection. My armor class went from 0% to 99%  in just a few moves. I hope there are still things to fight.All right, back to the Christmas Tree Monsters. Past them, I found a cabin in which I found a \"burin\" (an engraving tool; chalk another one up to \"What Have You Learned?\"), some wizard's black book, a black \"hemisphere,\" and a snow wight that, when killed, dropped a diamond. Beyond them is an \"iridescent dome of light,\" and I'm not sure what to do there.[Edit, hours after the original posting: \"Snow wight.\" Just got it. Good one.]So: several puzzles solved, but I remain stumped at how to get by the corbies in the fields, what I'm supposed to do at the dome, how to permanently solve the Christmas Tree Monster menace, and how to get to the castle I keep seeing from a distance (every time I try to fly there, the game tells me I encounter crosswinds).A couple of \"bad\" and \"meh\" votes from last night's entry makes me think people are sick of Beyond Zork--or maybe I'm going into too much detail--so I'll try to get out a Dungeon Master entry this evening, although it might not be all that comprehensible: I've promised myself that if I can stave off my CRPG addiction long enough to get some actual work done this Veteran's Day, I'll allow myself to liberally indulge my vodka gimlet addiction tonight."}, {"title": "Beyond Zork: Closing In", "date": "Wednesday, November 10, 2010", "text": "All right, in an effort to finish up Beyond Zork, I thought I'd craft a half-posting, half-note summary that will help me identify the areas with which I'm still having problems. This is going to get pretty detailed, so skip along to something else if you don't want to learn about the ins and outs of Quendor. I've noted when there are quests or puzzles I can't solve yet.East VillageThis is the name I've given for the beginning area. It consists of a hilltop with an oak tree--one of several oak trees under which the minx finds a truffle once you have him. Nearby is the edge of storms, which I cannot initially pass until I visit the Plane of Atrii and get a goblet from the implementors. I can pick a bit of spenseweed here to heal the pterodactyl later. Down a hill to the east is the wharf, where I can talk to a mysterious sailor creating a painting and find a shillelagh (club) bobbing in the river.Down the road to the south is \"Ye Rusty Lantern, A Public House.\" The rusty lantern in question is hanging outside, and I take it for use in dungeons; it is renewed with the Scroll of Renewal. The main room has a bearskin rug which I take and use to defeat the dornbeast in the lighthouse. There are a group of bandits who throw a rusty dagger at you that you can renew with the same scroll. There doesn't seem to be anything else to do with the bandits. In the kitchen is the cook who asks me to retrieve a bottle of wine from the cellar in exchange for a giant onion. For some reason, the cook (or maybe one of the bandits?) locks me in the cellar.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In the cellar, I find a scroll that will renew my lantern and allow it to last more than a few minutes (my intelligence must be high enough to read it, though; I got trapped down here once when it wasn't). I also find a bottle of wine at the top of a stack and kill three monsters: a rat-ant, a skeleton, and a discipline crab. There are minor treasures I can sell for zorkmids. There's a bit of moss to squeeze and improve my dexterity, and an amulet that temporarily boosts my strength so I can bash open the locked door (I don't need the amulet if I set my strength high enough in the beginning, but that would come at a sacrifice to other stats).In the north part of the village is a lighthouse whose entrance opens once I answer a riddle about lightning. There are several foes inside: a spider which I just kill; a giant slug which I kill by throwing salt on it (found up the road a bit); a dust bunny which I kill by hauling in the rug from the tavern, rubbing my feet on it, and touching it; and a dornbeast which I don't think I can kill (I tried for a while), but I can incapacitate by cutting the giant onion in his presence. The dornbeast guards a magical chest that, when opened, transports the opener to the Plane of TransInfinite Splendor, where unicorns roam. There are other assorted treasures in the lighthouse.Plane of TransInfinite SplendorI visit this location after opening the chest from the lighthouse. I meet some unicorns who are very unhappy at their treatment over the centuries at the hands of humans, and they warn me not to return. If I do, they consign me to a fate worse than death. I don't think there's anything else I can do in this place but send the monkey grinder here.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 AccardiAccardi is a little village north of the lighthouse. There is a weapons shop here, as well as the abandoned Guild of Enchanters. A little fairy refuses me entrance to the guild, but it isn't long before a monkey grinder appears and kills the fairy. He then tries to kill me, and the only way I've been able to defeat him is to give him the chest and watch him get transported to the Plane of TransInfinite Splendor and, presumedly, a grisly fate. In the abandoned guild, I find a wand of dispel whose use I haven't determined yet.MoorsThe moors are south of the village. Here, an eldritch vapor tries to alternately kill me and steal my items. A guttersnipe also attacks me. There are scattered random treasures. In a mud flat, a pterodactyl is wounded with an arrow through his wing. Helping him involves putting him to sleep with the hurdy-gurdy, taking the arrow out, and healing him with a spenseweed from the edge-of-storms area. I can then take his whistle and use it to summon him three times to give me a ride. So far, I'm not sure exactly where I need to ride to, but I think it's the castle I can see from a distance but not find.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BorpheeBorphee is a village south of the moors. There is an armor shop and a stable containing a unicorn. There is also an amusement ride called a skyway that gives me a ride over the Miznia Jungle.The unicorn locked in the stable gives a good example of the different ways you can do things in Beyond Zork, unlike its predecessors. Your ultimate goal is to free the unicorn from the stable, partly so you can get compassion points, but partly so you can get in and take the saddle you need for the pterodactyl. You can free her by (a) breaking the gate, either with the aforementioned amulet or just through your own raw strength; (b) pointing the wand of levitation at her and bringing her over the top of the gate; or (c) giving her the chest and letting her open it, returning her to her own land.Gurth CityWhen you first visit Gurth City, a vendor drops a fish cake which I eat for a boost to my intelligence statistic. The Magic Shoppe contains a number of useful items, but more important, the old woman who runs it identifies all of the various items I have found. Among the items she sells may be potions that raise my stats and a rabbit's foot that raises my luck.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 One of the items she sells is a really expensive hourglass, but I'm not sure what to do with it.Puzzles remaining:Uses for hourglassForestThere is a forest north of Gurth City in which I am attacked by a cruel puppet and, after him, a hellhound. The staff/rod/wand of annihilation comes in handy here. There is a clearing in which a riddle gives me access to a \"pool of eternal youth,\" which is nice and all but I didn't expect the game to take that long. Oh...wait...is this where I put the truffles to keep them from spoiling? Confirmed. Damn it. I knew typing this out would help. But then what do I do with the truffles?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 North of the forest is Zeno's Bridge, which I can never cross--I can only get closer and closer to the other end. If I get stuck on it, I have to use an umbrella (conveniently there) to jump off and float to safety. The ruins are on the other side, but I can only get to them with the Scroll of Gating or on the back of the pterodactyl.Puzzles remaining:What do do with the truffles after I use them in the pool of eternal youth.Miznia JungleI access Miznia Jungle by boarding a skycar in Borphee and riding it until I can jump to a support tower and climb down (to the tut of the disapproving conductor). Foes include a bloodworm and a crocodile, which I dispatch with my sword. There are scattered treasures. In a pit of quicksand, a baby hungus is sinking, and I must use my rod/wand of levitation to get him out, but first I need to agitate his moher into chasing me to a nearby idol. She serves as a counterbalance on the bottom of the idol as I climb to the top and extract a valuable jewel. She ends up eating the jewel, but a wand of eversion turns her inside out long enough for me to retrieve it. I can then levitate the baby to safety for some compassion points.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ThriffThe village of Thriff is south of the jungle. It is here I can save a minx from a group of hunters by erasing his footprints in the snow. Later, beneath the roots of oak trees, he will dig up truffles for me.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The village is threatened by Christmas Tree Monsters, kept at bay only by a glyph in the swiftly-melting snow. Occupants of a nearby chapel are in a tizzy about this, and a \"Cardinal Toolbox\" has a sermon on the issue. He is guarding a reliquary that I assume I need at some point. The monsters cannot be killed by weapons or magic. It would seem that I must scare them off with a caterpillar (this is the manual's clue), and Jason Dyer said that I could \"make\" a caterpillar, but I haven't found how to do that yet. I can also see a castle in the distance but can't seem to reach it.Puzzles remaining:How to find or make a caterpillar so I can get past the Christmas Tree monstersHow to reach the castle in the distanceEthereal Plane of AtriiI reach the plane by using the Scroll of Gating (found in a random location), and from here I can travel quickly to other parts of the map, but it's a bad idea to use it for travel because you only get so many chances to visit. I finally figured out the \"vague outline\" from the treasure chest turns into a \"phase blade\" when I visit the plane. I can use it to cut what is another \"vague outline\" blocking my path, thus allowing me to visit the court of the Implementors.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Implementors, who alternately insult and ignore me, are clearly intended to represent the game's creators. They make fun of me for any errors I made in spelling earlier. As I watch them mess around with the Coconut of Quendor, an ur-grue suddenly appears and steals it. They task me with retrieving it--thus the main quest begins well into the game! They also give me a goblet to get me past the fields of lightning below.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fields of FrotzenThe Fields of Frotzen are accessible once I have the goblet from the implementors. The place consists of several fields of scarecrows with angry corbies (giant crows, basically) circling overhead.Oh, hell! There's a butterfly here! How come I didn't see it before? Clearly, I'm supposed to do something with the butterfly to turn it into a caterpillar. Wait...doesn't this happen the other way around? He was easy enough to catch: he just landed on my goblet and I stuffed him in my pack. Jesus, do I have to tear his wings off?Elsewhere is an area that I can't access because the corbies block my path. I can't figure a way through or around them. I'm guessing from the manual that I need to be carrying something of a particular color to scare them, but I can't find anything.Puzzles remaining:How to turn the butterfly into a caterpillar, if that's what I have to do.How to get past the corbies blocking the north exitRuinsThe ruins are north of Zeno's Bridge and accessible from the Ethereal Plane of Atrii or by flying on the pterodactyl. There's a spade here, but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to dig for. A ghoul and an undead warrior attack me; the latter is defeated with a vial of holy water.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I feel like there must be something else to do in the ruins other than defeat the undead and collect treasures. I'm not sure what it is. I'm guessing it has something to do with the hourglass, perhaps turning back time, given the way the game keeps emphasizing what the place must have looked like in its heyday, and the manual talks about it, too. But nothing I do seems to have any effect.Puzzles remaining:What to do in the ruinsHere are a few miscellaneous notes I've discovered:There are potions of death and forgetfulness in the game. Their outcomes are predictable if I drink them. I'm not sure if there's a place to use these on someone else.There are many ways you can attack foes, like a spider, including \"ATTACK SPIDER WITH SWORD,\" \"KILL SPIDER WITH SWORD,\" \"HIT SPIDER WITH SWORD,\" and so on. Searching through the documentation, I found that THRUST AT is also a command, and I tried it out, and it seems to result in a hit way more often than any of the other commands. I don't know if this is a bug or not.One of the scrolls you find is a Scroll of Fireworks that, when you read it, gives you the credits for the game.You hardly ever kill any monsters; instead, you wound them enough that they slink away.If you swear, the game reduces your intelligenceThat's about the size of it. I feel like I'm pretty close, especially now that I've found that butterfly. I'm going to let my brain mull all of this while I play a little more Dungeon Master, but hopefully we can have a \"won!\" posting soon."}, {"title": "Game 33: Dungeon Master (1987)", "date": "Tuesday, November 9, 2010", "text": "I don't like games with names this generic. It makes it hard to Google for \"Dungeon Master manual.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dungeon MasterUnited StatesFTL Games (developer and publisher)Released in 1987 for Atari ST; 1988 for Amiga; 1989 for Apple IIGS and FM Towns; 1990 for PC-98; 1992 for DOS; 1993 for SNESDate Started: 10 March 2020\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Well. What an unexpected pleasure. Only a few postings ago, I was lamenting that none of the recent games were really feeding my CRPG addiction. You know--taking my attention from work, making me ignore my wife and friends, keeping me up until the break of dawn. I missed that. I'm not saying Dungeon Master is that game--not yet--but it is a multi-character game set in a multi-level dungeon with strong graphics and sound, so it certainly has the potential. Oddly, I'd never heard of this game until a few weeks ago, when I noticed it was coming up in my queue. As I am occasionally reminded (Starflight, Phantasie) there are hidden treasures from this era awaiting discovery.The back story to Dungeon Master is told in a well-written 18-page prologue to the game manual. The dungeon in question was the abode of the Grey Lord, an extremely powerful wizard who many people regarded as a god. One fateful day, the Grey Lord discovered beneath his mountain the Power Gem--the source of the creation of men, dwarves, halflings, elves and \"High Lords\"--and thought he would use it to usher in a new era of world peace. But something went wrong in the casting of the spell needed to extract it, and it ended up tearing the Grey Lord's essence into two halves: the benevolent \"good\" wizard, and Lord Chaos, bent on using the gem for the destruction of the world.The Grey Lord's apprentice, Theron, was affected by the event because...I don't know...I guess he was psychically linked to the Grey Lord at the time, even though he was visiting his girlfriend in the next village. His spirit was cast into limbo, but there he received a message from the Grey Lord (now going, for some reason, by the name \"Librasius\"). In the years that had passed since the catastrophe, the Grey Lord had sent hundreds of champions into the dungeon with the quest to recover the Grey Lord's Firestaff, which would give the Grey Lord the power to assume corporeal form again and defeat Lord Chaos. Unfortunately, all the adventurers died. Now, the Grey Lord has tasked Theron with the task to resurrect four of those adventurers and guide them through the dungeon.Sorry, but it takes a long time to summarize 18 pages.Thus, although you control four heroes in the game, the player literally takes the role of the noncorporeal Theron, who guides their actions. If you've ever played a multi-player CRPG and wondered who \"you\" are supposed to be, since you can't be all of the party members at once, this game answers it for you. It's very meta.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The setup means that Dungeon Master has a unique party creation process, though. You don't really \"create\" your party--instead, your incorporeal essence wanders the Hall of Champions on the first level of the dungeon, reviewing the characteristics and equipment of each of the 24 heroes enshrined there, and choosing which you want for your adventure. You actually have two options: to \"resurrect\" the hero, with his attributes and skills intact, or to \"reincarnate\" the hero, which wipes his memory (and skills) and allows you to give him a different name. In the prologue, Theron expresses horror at this idea for its obvious ethical implications.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This is the first clue that perhaps the \"good\" half of the Grey Lord may not be all that good. I feel like the game is setting me up for a very obvious twist ending.There are four character types: fighter, ninja, wizard, and priest. But characters can be multi-classed; at least one is all four classes. I really didn't have much of a basis for choosing except a desire to have some representation from all four.The character screen. Note the food in the inventory slots.The game starts you off with a few disadvantages. First, you're limited to the equipment that your resurrected characters had upon death, which in my case wasn't much. Second, you have no idea which way you're facing in the dungeon. I'm not sure how you ever find this out. I just guessed for the purposes of the map. Third, you have no clue what the different spells are. Spells in this game are cast by stringing together glyphs. The game manual tells you the glyphs...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...but not in what order you must string them to achieve certain outcomes. Fortunately, you find scrolls along the way that give you hints. I've already determined that LO FUL gives a low-level light spell.A couple of other random notes:This is one of several games in the era to require food. This is a good element in CRPGs for the realism value. Realism as in, \"Hey, Leyla! Here's an ear of corn I found in a dank crevice on the sixth level of a dungeon! Tuck in!\"Although the dungeons are made up of gridded tiles, the game occurs in real time, meaning if you just stand there, monsters will advance on you and kill you, your characters will get hungry, your spells and torches run out, and so on. As far as I can tell, there's no \"pause\" option--not even when you go to inventory. This makes mapping--and blogging--fairly difficult. [Later edit: Reader Menetekel clued me in that the ESC key pauses the game. Thanks!]Although you can move with the keypad, the mouse is most of the interface for the game. You have to click on various buttons on the screen to attack, manipulate objects, and access inventory.Note the four attack icons--hand, club, arrow, and sling--on the right side. When I open this gate, I have to click these quickly in sequence to fight the mummy behind it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dungeon Master was originally published for the Atari ST in 1987; its DOS port came in 1989. The technical improvements over games like Might & Magic and Wizardry are obvious. It supports VGA graphics and sound cards like AdLib and SoundBlaster. (It is the first CRPG in my blog that uses a mouse, though it only gets this award because I'm playing in order of original release date, not DOS release date.) Finally, it takes advantage of (then-) modern CPU power and offers real-time, not turn-based, gameplay. It's quite startling, after the latest sequence of games, to start the application and be greeted with animated graphics, decent-quality audio, background music, and an unresponsive keyboard!The publisher, FTL Games, never published anything but the Dungeon Master series and a 1984 adventure game called SunDog: Frozen Legacy. None of its games appear to have sold nearly as well as Dungeon Master, and the company disbanded in the early 1990s. I'll save discussions of Dungeon Master's legacy for my final posting on the game, except to note that if the Eye of the Beholder series didn't license Dungeon Master's interface, it sure ripped it off.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Tonight, I got Level 1 mapped (not hard because most of it was the Hall of Adventurers) and started to map Level 2, where after a fight with a mummy I was rewarded with some decent treasure. As I say, it definitely has promise. I'm going to make a return to Beyond Zork tomorrow and then see how addicted I can get to this new game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your first sword in any CRPG is always a bit of a thrill."}, {"title": "Game 32: Braminar (1987)", "date": "Monday, November 8, 2010", "text": "Braminar is a CRPG the way that the home movies your dad made are \"cinema.\" They might be interesting, but you wouldn't expect to find them cataloged on IMDB. Braminar's inclusion on MobyGames's list of CRPGs stretches the definition of the term to its utmost limits.Braminar might be the oddest game I've played since starting this blog. First, it's all text. The short documentation that comes with it describes it as a \"Boolean interactive fiction\" game. The author seems to have gotten sick of traditional Infocom-style interactive fiction (like Beyond Zork, from which I took a break to play Braminar) in which you have to remember (and in some cases divine) the right verb/object combo to use. So he offered a game in which all of your choices boiled down to \"yes\" or \"no\" or a selection from a very limited list.The action takes place in the titular land, \"a magical kingdom plagued by an evil overlord,\" who has \"raised taxes, enslaved villages, and outlawed hamburgers.\" You play a young male or female warrior raising an army and developing experience so you can challenge the overlord. Character creation consists only of giving yourself a name and sex; the game randomly generates everything else, including your hair color and whether you have \"good looks\" or not!I do. Naturally.Then the action begins, and boy is it relentless. The game simply throws one encounter after another at you:You come up to a thicket in the woods. Enter? (Y/N)You come upon the Dark Castle of the Mad King. Enter? (Y/N)The statue of Pan suddenly animates and asks you the following riddle: Why does Pan play the flute? 1 - His sax is broke; 2 - His tube is broke; 3 - 'cause it's there. Choose (1,2,3) (I guessed that one right as #3 and was given \"the prime command is GOMDC\")You come upon a flowing river. Gaze into it? (Y/N)Things seem strangely quiet when out of nowhere jumps a band of demons. They look grumpy. The say they will let you pass if ou give them 2 male slaves, 5 female slaves, 6 gold pieces, or you may fight their champ and win their horde. Do you wish to (f)ight, (g)ive, or (r)un?While you are walking along, the weather suddenly changes. A tidal wave comes. Will you take shelter? (Y/N)If you successfully navigate these--and winning battles is entirely due to chance; you play no role in the combat--you slowly gain levels, gold, and slaves. Yes, slaves. I don't really know what they're about, but the game keeps track of how many male and female slaves you own. You need to keep up a food supply to feed them and medicine for when they get sick. I guess you're ultimately using them as soldiers in the final battle. The goal is to get to Level 20, find the Staff of the Aviatar, and confront the mad overlord in his castle.\u00a0 Here's an encounter that anticipates the button-pushing-sequence \"quick time\" challenges of a lot of X-box adventure games by more than 20 years: \"You spot a large chest of gold at the throne. Press: 1 / = \\ H keys in that sequence to simulate grabbing gold and putting it in a bag. A mis-typed key = dropped gold. Don't make too much noise, or the king will hear you and enter the room!\"\u00a0 I stole food from a gnome and got knocked down a level by my deity. I entered a gypsy camp and engaged in a stabbing-a-dagger-between-the-fingers game and lost. A fortune teller told me \"enter no dungeon without a dagger.\" I ordered a drink at a tavern, realized it was poisoned, held on to it, and used it in a battle against demons to win automatically. I lost dozens of slaves to starvation when my food supplies ran out. I refused to steal from a tree and got the Talisman of Braminar for being a good person. I was ambushed by a troglodyte at a river, but I defeated him in combat and acquired his gold and slaves. I entered a hut in the woods, was attacked by the evil wizard Anthrax, but instantly vaporized him with a ring on my finger. In a river, I had a vision of a deity giving me a box of \"Duncin' Donuts\" [sic]. And so on, through a couple of dozen such encounters (a few of which repeated). Finally, I died at the hands of some drow elves.The best things in life always pass so soon.The game offers no way to save, so when you die, you simply have to start over and try again.Braminar is an interesting curio, published by a shareware company named PC-SIG that apparently went defunct in the early 1990s after publishing half a dozen titles. I'm guessing that whoever included it in the MobyGames RPG list would say that its inventory and statistics qualify it as an RPG. My problem is that it's not even really a \"game.\" If Braminar was Super Mario Brothers, you'd get a question at the beginning saying \"Do you want to try to rescue the princess? (Y/N),\" and you'd say \"Y\" and watch the computer play the game in front of you.I should probably exclude shareware titles from my list, but honestly, it didn't take me long to play, and it didn't take you long to read it, right? I give it a 9/100 on the GIMLET scale (it's not even worth explaining why). I'm going to hit Beyond Zork for a few more hours and then see about Dungeon Master.One more WTF screen shot, though (y'all realize you can click on these to enlarge, right?):Nnnnooooooooo! Anything but that!******For further reading: 7 years later, I was persuaded to take a second look at the game and still didn't like it. I did win it, though.This was painful.There is effectively no way to win Beyond Zork with the same character you started with. You simply have to accept that 90% of your playing time will involve messing around and figuring out puzzles so that your final character--the one that wins the game--will be able to use the accumulated wisdom. Ultimately, you do something that \"breaks\" the game. I did it yesterday when I levitated the baby hippo out of the quicksand before I lured his mother to the statue to help me get the jewel. I did it again today when I used up the Scroll of Gating before accomplishing everything I needed to accomplish on the \"Ethereal Plain of Atrii.\" I did it another time today when I wasted my three pterodactyl rides.Solving the pterodactyl puzzle involved putting it to sleep with the hurdy-gurdy, taking the arrow out of its wing, healing the wing with a special weed (that took me a damned long time; I knew they existed because of the manual, but it's mentioned very obscurely in the place that you find it), putting a saddle on its back, and taking its whistle. You can blow the whistle to summon it three times. Since there are several places you have to fly to and from to visit, you can't waste a trip goofing around, which is what I did.The problem is, you keep thinking that this time you've figured out all the puzzles, and this character will be the one that goes the distance. Then you realize you've bungled the next puzzle and have to start over again.Still, starting over beats getting stuck on the puzzles, which is where I remain. The most insidious puzzles are the ones you don't even know exist; you only see pieces of them. For instance, with reader Jason Dyer's help, I figured out how to save the minx from the hunters by erasing its tracks, so now I have a pet minx. I named him after one of my readers.Now, I know from the manual that minxes find truffles, and sure enough, if I bring the minx to an oak tree and hang around, he ultimately digs one up. But it goes bad within a few moves and dissolves. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with it. There is a road blocked by Christmas Tree Monsters, who are afraid of caterpillars, but damned if I can find any caterpillars. There's a castle that I can see from a couple of angles but I can't find any way to reach it. (The pterodactyl is an obvious solution, but he won't fly against the wind, and the wind always seems to be blowing against me when I try to reach the area that the castle would be in.)My inventory is chock full of stuff that's probably the solution to one puzzle or another, but I don't know what: a horseshoe, an hourglass, a dispel staff, a shovel, and something called a \"vague outline.\"The CRPG Addict does not consider himself a man of great willpower--he is, after all, playing CRPGs instead of working on his dissertation--so knowing that the answers to all of these questions are a quick Google search away is driving him a bit crazy. But he shall not succumb.Nonetheless, I can't keep relying on readers for hints, and I don't want to drag this one out. To solve some of these puzzles, I may have to resort to brute tactics in which I revisit every location and try every object. Thus, I'm going to take the unusual step of playing an interlocutory game while I continue to puzzle through Beyond Zork. My next posting will be on Braminar (tonight; this short posting doesn't constitute a day's work) but I'll devote a little time each day to Beyond Zork--maybe posting updates, maybe not. What I can promise you is there will be a \"won!\" posting for Beyond Zork eventually."}, {"title": "Beyond Zork: Giant Onions, Unicorns, and Puppets", "date": "Sunday, November 7, 2010", "text": "I could only think of one way to get revenge on the cook for locking me in the cellar.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Quendor is a reasonably small place, and frankly I haven't bothered mapping it because the various sites are fairly easy to remember (and also because certain locations generate random maps).

Once you find them, the associated shop will identify them and buy them. Shops also sell useful items. I've restarted a couple of times, and sometimes items I found on the ground in one game are in the Magic Shoppe in another, and vice versa. Earlier Zorks didn't have this randomization at all.My big victory of the day was figuring out what to do with the onion. The whole cutting-an-onion-and-crying thing seemed obvious, but I didn't know who would benefit from crying. I took it to a depressed unicorn and cut it there. I don't know why I thought it would help. Naturally, it just made things worse.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rolling a giant onion up to a depressed unicorn and cutting it to make her cry ought to send you directly to adventure-game Hell.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I thought I'd try it on the cruel puppet next. Maybe he wouldn't be so cruel if he was sad. But it just made him more cruel, and then he killed me.The cruel puppet crossed the line.So I decided to give up on the onion for a while and concentrate on how in the world was I going to defeat the monster at the top of the lighthouse: the Dornbeast, a fearsome creature with 69 eyes--69 \"sensitive eyes,\" as the manual explains. I mean, what an annoying game, right? Giant onions... beasts with 69 sensitive eyes... how am I ever going to get through this game without a walkthrough? Yes, I have become the Homer Simpson of adventure game playing:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 As embarrassingly long as it took, I did ultimately figure it out, distracting the dorn with onion fumes long enough to get the chest he was protecting.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I ignored the chest's warning, written on a brass plaque, not to open it. I was teleported to a land of unicorns who were not at all happy with my presence and banished me back to the real world. Just for fun, I opened the chest and visited again, and I--or, I should say, Adamantyr--had one of the more memorable deaths of any adventure game:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Well, if the chest takes the person who opens it to a land of unicorns, it seemed I had a sure way to help one unhappy unicorn locked in a stable. Sure enough, she used it to return home, and I got a boost in compassion for my troubles. I also got a boost in luck when I (as clued in by the manual) kissed her horn.The chest seemed like a good way to get rid of enemies, so I tried giving it to the cook, the cruel puppet, and a group of bandits to no avail. With the monkey grinder, though, I hit paydirt. (I should have realized this from the manual's description that monkey grinders \"suffer an illiteracy rate of 103%.\")\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the monkey grinder gone, I was able to get his hurdy-gurdy (yes, another word I will never again get to type in any other CRPG review). An interesting device, it has six settings: eye, ear, nose, mouth, hand, and clock. When you point it to one of the settings and turn the crank, either something good or something bad happens related to the setting. For instance, if it's on \"ear,\" you might hear beautiful music or a horrific cacophony.The cruel puppet and the hellhound both fell to a Rod of Annihilation that I found somewhere. Getting past them, I came to a boulder with a riddle:Never ahead, ever behindYet flying swiftly pastFor a child, I last foreverFor adults, I'm gone too fastWhat am I?The CRPG Addict knows the answer to that one only too well. The correct answer causes the glade to erupt in a \"pool of radiance.\" I'm sure it's just a coincidence.Beyond the forest, I found a rope bridge called \"Zeno's Bridge.\" It's a cute joke:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Just to be sure, I went all the way to 2047/2048.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If I wasn't already aware of Zeno's Paradox, I might learn about it from this game, so chalk another one up to \"What Have You Learned?\"So, how to get across the bridge--if there is a way, and it's not just a joke--is one puzzle I haven't figured out yet. The others keeping me occupied are:A wounded pterodactyl with a whistle around his neck. He won't let me come near him.There's an hourglass in the magick shoppe for 1000 zorkmids. I've sold everything I'm comfortable selling, and I only have 121 zorkmids. I have no idea where you get so much for the hourglass, or even if the hourglass is all that important. (I spent 100 zorkmids on a sword, but I'm not sure if that was really a good investment; I seemed to be doing okay with my dagger.)On an idol in a jungle is a tear-shaped jewel, but every time I try to climb up to it, the idol overbalances and I fall inside of it. My stick of levitation is exhausted, so I can't use that.I have a bunch of wands, staffs, and rods, and I'm not sure which ones I really need to keep to solve puzzles and which ones I can sell. My inventory is getting pretty full.In one place, a bunch of hunters ferret out a minx and take it. I have the impression that I need the minx for something, as the manual mentions them, but I can't figure out how to stop the hunters form getting it.There's a trail blocked by \"Christmas Tree Monsters\" (see below). Getting past them involves something to do with inscribing a glyph, or perhaps finding a caterpillar.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another Beyond Zork original.\u00a0\u00a0 If you want to hint me on any of these, give me very light hints, not outright spoilers, please.On the plus side, I keep getting to rescue animals. This episode was a little heartwarming. My compassion is going through the roof. (Technically, I'm not sure what that does for me.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 One final mystery: I ended up naming my sword \"Elzair\" to close out my \"Guess the Game\" obligations. But my first attempt was to name it after frequent commenter Xyzzy. When I tried that, I got:A hollow voice says, \"Fool! That name is reserved by the Implementors. Choose another!\"What are the odds that the handle of one of my readers is a \"reserved word\" in a 23-year-old game? Assuming that reserved words are commands, I just typed \"Xyzzy\" in the command line, and the game said, \"A hollow voice says, 'Fool!'\" What's the in-joke that I'm missing? I'm afraid to Google it for fear I'll get spoilers.This may not be a \"real\" CRPG, but I'm having a lot of fun  with it. As in previous Infocom games, the quality of the writing is  excellent, the humor witty, and the puzzles original. It's hard to ask for more."}, {"title": "Beyond Zork: Zorkish Puzzles, Beyond-Zorkish Combat", "date": "Saturday, November 6, 2010", "text": "In Zork, you could fight a couple of monsters with your Elvish sword of great antiquity, but the outcome was based on pure luck. You kept swinging and they kept swinging, and either you'd die and reload or the monster would die and you could continue on.Beyond Zork changes all of that by introducing first, a lot more monsters, and second, a skill-based combat system in which your strength helps determine the damage, your dexterity helps determine your chance to hit, and your endurance determines how many blows you can take. There's still quite a bit of luck involved, though.I have to confess that its CRPG creds are nonetheless doubtful. There are only a few monsters that you kill in this manner. Most of the rest you have to banish in the traditional adventure game fashion: by solving a puzzle. Take the slug that occupies another room in the same abandoned lighthouse as the spider. You can beat at it with the club and ultimately kill it that way, I suppose, but its demise is so much quicker (and more satisfying) if you toss some salt on it.What kind of a game doesn't recognize \"boo-ya\"?Puzzles, often inventory-based puzzles, are the hallmark of adventure games, both text and graphical, and boy does Beyond Zork have some hard ones. Some depend on reading the manual (thanks to Jason Dyer for emphasizing this in a comment yesterday), some on common sense, some on careful deduction, and some on bat$*#% logic that only a career Zork player would possess.For instance, in the same lighthouse, hiding under a bed, is a \"dust bunny.\" No, not the kind your mother-in-law is always finding, but the man-eating kind (the kind you wish your mother-in-law would actually find). Here's the manual's take on dust bunnies, with an amusing image:So they respond to static electricity. For a while I thought this meant that I had to find a Wand of Lightning or a ZAP spell or something. Nope. You know what it is? You take a bearskin rug from a pub, carry it to the room where the dust bunny is lurking, drop it, step on it, shuffle your feet to build up a charge of static electricity, and touch the dust bunny.Now, if you're not much of an adventure game player, you're sitting there asking, \"How in the world would you ever know to do that?\" And the answer is simple: you explore the map until you realize that there's no Wand of Lightning to be found. So you visit every location, talking to yourself like a madman, \"Dust bunnies... dust bunnies are afraid of electricity... and lemon-scented spray... electricity... static... lemons... where can I get lemons?.... where can I get electricity?... can I get electricity from an oak tree?... no, what about this painting... SAILOR, TELL ME ABOUT STATIC... that didn't work... static... electricity... lemons... here's a shop... BUY LEMONS... that was stupid... hey, here's a bar... I wonder if they sell lemonade... no lemonade... here's a bear-skin rug... rug... static... AHA!\"The problem is, this goes on for about 20 puzzles in the game, and I'm dangerously close to admitting defeat on almost half of them. Right now, my big conundrums are figuring out how to make a pterodactyl sit still long enough to remove an arrow from its wing and how to defeat an organ-grinder monkey. An organ-grinder monkey? Oh, yes, I'm quite serious:CRPG or not, no other game features monsters this original.While we're on unique monsters, here's the game's description of another creative offering: the cruel puppet.And here's a shot from my encounter with the puppet in the game:Beyond Zork: the only game that lets  you fight an emotionally abusive puppet.To give you a sense of both combat and puzzles, I'm going to paste below the transcript from my adventures in the basement of the bar, where I was sent to recover a bottle of wine in exchange for a giant onion. I have no idea what to do with the onion. I'm guessing it's not related to the pterodactyl, but you never know.The basement is one of several locations in Beyond Zork in which a random map generates every time you enter, so you can never be sure of finding the exact same items and monsters in the exact same locations. The script was automatically generated by the game, although I've redacted some of the parts where I died and reloaded or tried to do embarrassingly stupid things.*****>WKitchenCoils of greasy steam rise from a cauldron bubbling over a roaring hearth.

Each puzzle you solve gives you a bit of a thrill. I look forward to seeing if I can complete this without any help--although if you've played it, feel free to give me a hint--just a hint, mind you--on the pterodactyl."}, {"title": "Game 31: Beyond Zork: The Coconut of Quendor (1987)", "date": "Friday, November 5, 2010", "text": "The tough thing about playing Beyond Zork is resisting the temptation to go back and play Zorks I, II, and III. Actually, to be fair, I didn't resist. I downloaded the original Zork and played for about 20 minutes before I realized I still remembered the entire game by heart. I figured the time it took to type in all of the commands and win all three games--just as a prologue--would probably tax my readers' patience.West of HouseYou are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.There is a small mailbox here.--Opening to the original Zork (1980)I do love text adventures, though--not as much as good CRPGs, but I definitely have a soft spot for them. A world of commands at your fingertips, no images or sound except what your imagination conjures. The key to the Infocom text adventures (the Zork series, the Enchanter series, the Planetfall series, Deadline, and the inimitable Leather Goddesses of Phobos among many others) is that they were well-written. Playing them was like a combination between a good RPG and a good novel. They were also extremely funny; I don't know if Terry Pratchett ever played Zork or if the creators of Zork ever read the Discworld series (the games and the first books were published contemporaneously), but they both share a humorous subversion of traditional fantasy tropes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bumper sticker available from Zazzle.com\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So to get properly into Beyond Zork, we should at least recap the previous games.In Zork, you play the role of an ageless, faceless, gender-neutral, culturally ambiguous adventure person (there is a \"special topics\" posting coming up on TVTropes) who starts out next to a house but soon finds himself exploring part of the once-flourishing, now-collapsed Great Underground Empire. The purpose of the game is to find 20 treasures and install them in a trophy case in the abandoned house. This grants you access to a tunnel that takes you to Zork II.Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz picks up where Zork left off. Here, you must recover 10 treasures while contending with the mad wizard of the title.In Zork III, you solve a series of puzzles to become the new Dungeon Master of the Great Underground Empire and gain access to its vast treasure chambers.The seaman looks up and maneuvers the boat toward shore. He cries out \"I have waited three ages for someone to say those words and save me from sailing this endless ocean. Please accept this gift. You may find it useful!\" He throws something which falls near you in sand, then sails off toward the west, singing a lively, but somewhat uncouth, sailor song.--The most rewarding moment in the Zork series. Trust me; you have to play it.Throughout all of this, of course, you control your ageless, faceless, etc. character through the use of typed commands. Here is a transcript from the original Zork:You are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east is a small window which is open. On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers. A bottle is sitting on the table. The glass bottle contains a quantity of water.>TAKE ALLBrown sack: taken. Glass bottle: taken.>OPEN SACKOpening the brown sack reveals a lunch and a clove of garlic.>WESTYou are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room. Above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity. A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.>TAKE SWORD AND LANTERNSword: taken. Brass lantern: taken.>MOVE RUGWith great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room, revealing the dusty cover of a closed trap door.>OPEN TRAP DOORThe door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending into darkness.>DOWNYou have moved into a dark place. The trap door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it. It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue. Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.>LIGHT LANTERNThe brass lantern is now on. You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.>NORTHThe Troll Room. This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls. A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room. Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.>TROLL, HELLOThe troll isn't much of a conversationalist. The troll pauses for a moment, perhaps thinking that you should re-read the manual.>PET TROLLFiddling with the troll has no effect. The troll's mightly blow drops you to your knees.>KILL TROLL WITH SWORDYour attack is ineffective. The flat of the troll's axe hits you delicately on the head, knocking you out. The troll scratches his head ruminatively: might you be magically protected, he wonders? Conquering his fears, the troll puts you to death.Thank God the troll killed me, or I might have just kept transcribing all the way to the end.I didn't play the Zork trilogy as part of this project because they're not CRPGs. But Beyond Zork changes all of that. Although the interface is still controlled by text inputs, you have a named character--a named character with attributes like endurance, strength, dexterity, intelligence, compassion, and luck. You also gain experience points as you slay monsters. This is, to my knowledge, the only text/CRPG hybrid like this in existence.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Character creation in Beyond Zork.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Beyond Zork also reboots the story, making my summaries above a bit superfluous. The action moves out of the Great Underground Empire and to the land of Quendor, where the Age of Magic has given way to the Age of Science. To preserve their heritage from the future, the enchanters and enchantresses of the land have decided to hide away the Coconut of Quendor, a mysterious artifact that \"embodies the essence of their wisdom.\" Your role in this quest is unclear at the beginning, as you start as a nameless peasant. Working through the winners of my \"Guess the Game\" posting, I named my character \"Adamantyr.\"I start at a hilltop next to a tree with nothing but a pack and a single Zorkmid (the game's currency) to my name. But soon I've ambled down the hill to where an old sailor is creating a painting on a canvas, and I've pulled a bit of driftwood out of the water to use as a club. Since \"shillelagh\" (what the game calls it) is too easy to misspell, I use the game's NAME command to dub my new club \"Zink.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Note the little automap in the upper right-hand corner. It doesn't save me from having to actually create a map, but it helps to know what ways I can go.Up the path a ways, I find a ledge with an inscription: \"My tines be long, my tines be short, my tines end ere my first report. What am I?\" Confidently, I answer \"lightning,\" and in true Infocom style, I get my \"reward\":Kerblam! A blast from the sky sends you sprawling over the brink of the ledge!

I am gratified  to see the word \"bizarre\" in the first sentence. He mentions the  free-form dialog but also a number of features that I don't have,  probably because they weren't included in the DOS port: a cool  soundtrack, and a beating-heart effect that tells you when you're about  to die. I wonder what year we have to get into before the DOS/PC version  isn't the worst version of every game.He goes on to say, \"Alien Fires  is an extremely difficult game...I certainly wouldn't recommend it to  everyone, but I've never played another game that had the same  otherworldly ambiance.\" See, Barton has a way with words. He says  \"otherworldly ambiance.\" I say, \"WTF?\"It's going to be a long six hours.Since yesterday, I managed to find the pocket watch--the huge pocket watch--sought by our rabbit-horse friend, Mangle Tangle.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I'm late, I'm late...for a very important hernia operation.In  return for the watch, I got an \"octo knife.\" It was nice to finally  have a weapon because I kept running into Octo agents in the hallways  and getting killed. Let's talk about combat for a second. Barton calls  it a \"furious affair.\" He's right. Once you engage in it, you have to  keep mashing the \"attack\" key (in my case, the spacebar), hoping to  score more hits than your opponent within the roughly 2.3 seconds that  combat lasts. I have yet to win.Never bring an octo knife to a sword/pulse rifle fight.While  I was happy to get the knife, it introduced a new problem: Mangle  Tangle the rabbit-horse decided he didn't like me. I might have  accidentally hit the space bar (attack) while standing in front of him.  Whatever the cause, he kept showing up, blocking the hallways, and  killing me. I was unable to use his own knife against him to any effect.Feel free not to.When  you get killed the Time Lords resurrect you and send you on back to the  beginning. There's some more WTF stuff going on in that screen shot. Do  they have my soul in a test tube or something? Unfortunately, this  doesn't make Mangle Tangle any less hostile, and I kept dying over and  over. If there's a way to turn a character un-hostile after he attacks  you, or skirt around him, I haven't found it. Ultimately, I had to  re-start with a new character.The next time around, I realized  that I'd been neglecting the \"examine\" key, which tells you a little  about the people in front of you.That clears up the whole \"droid\" thing.I also found another clue about the evil Octo corporation from a hand on a ship that the company had confiscated.After  retrieving Mangle Tangle's pocket watch for the second time and getting  his knife again, I found the elevator to the second level, where Alien Fires made a reasonably funny joke:\"The jerk gets off at Level 2 and the elevator continues on.\"Ominously,  the game congratulated me for this achievement and warned me that the  rest of the game wouldn't be as easy as Level 1. Oh, goodie.I'm glad I'm not supposed to be undercover.You might note that there isn't a single screenshot that doesn't have some glaring grammar or syntax problem. I know I make my share, too, but when I see them, I do recognize them as errors. No one on Jagware's staff could do that, apparently.Aside from the grating text, the  main problem at this point is that I just can't stop dying. Even with my  knife, I've yet to win a single battle. I'm not even sure I've scored a  hit.Barton, I see you lurking over there in my \"Followers\" list.  Given that I don't get to experience the sound effects, music, and  atmosphere that you described in your book, is it worth continuing with  this one? I ask because I haven't really enjoyed a  game--really experienced that classic \"addict\" sensation where you want  to stay up until 03:00 to play, and you even sneak in an hour or two at  work, if the afternoon is quiet--since Starflight,  and part of me wants to keep pushing through these  interesting-but-dated titles until I get to something I know will  satisfy this jones, like Phantasie III or Pool of Radiance.No hurry.

Read instead my updated look at the game from 2017: Post 1 and Post 2.] Can it be a coincidence that we have two sci-fi CRPGs, released in the same year,  that have an anno domini in the title? And both used wrongly, with the  \"A.D.\" coming after, not before, the year? Maybe not, but in any event  Alien Fires: 2199 A.D. owes nothing to 2400 A.D. It has a very different  interface and plot. Also, it doesn't make any sense.If a \"time-transportation device\" threatens the universe, one wonders what the \"TimeLords\" actually do to earn their titles.The game's backstory is an obvious fusion of Doctor Who and Apocalypse Now. You play a TimeLord (one of an immortal race of beings  responsible for protecting the temporal balance of the universe) given a  quest by your TimeLord Elders to track down the brilliant and disturbed  Samuel Kurtz, who has escaped to \"a small planet at the edge of known  universe\" with an \"awesome device\" that \"threatens to twist the very  fabric of time itself.\"My character is as slow as a snail crawling on the edge of a straight razor.Character creation involves giving yourself a name and allocating 99  points among seven skills: fighting, marksmanship, diplomacy, dexterity,  understanding, tracking, and quickness. The manual describes each of  these skills, and they are about what you'd expect, but I love their  description for \"understanding,\" which includes: \"generally, this will  help your character point dangerous items like plasma rifles in the  correct direction before firing them.\" Wow. I hope it helps with not  walking into walls, too.The game starts you off in the middle of a space station called Galaxy's  End, with very little information about what to do except that you need  to find an elevator to the next level. (I think the manual I've found  is only a partial one, which doesn't help.) The game is in first-person  view with wireframe walls (how retro) but--get this--continuously  scrolling.  We  haven't seen this since Alternate Reality.The other graphics in the  game seem pretty decent, such as the various robots you encounter in the  station.Or maybe this guy isn't a robot. It's hard to tell.Now,  on the robots: you can talk to them, and the dialog, as far as I can tell, is completely open-ended. I don't mean just keywords here; you type entire sentences! Naturally, it must be scanning your sentences for keywords, but it still feels pretty cool. Here's a conversation I just had with what looks like a droid but might be a man. The horrible errors of grammar and syntax are the game's, not mine.TRISTAR: Hello. I hope you have come to help us, there is not much time - you must go to the next level and talk to angel, but beware - there are Octo agents everywhere.ME: Who are you?TRISTAR: I am Tristar, the chief and only mechanic of Galaxy's End.ME: What are you?TRISTAR: What do you mean, what am I? What are you? What is anybody? I am a sophisticated chemical composition comprised of about 76 percent water. So there.ME: What are Octo agents?TRISTAR: Octo is a scientific research company, they are very secretive. They often land here for supplies and shipments of Micalite from the mine.ME: Where is the elevator?TRISTAR: The elevator is in the elevator shaftME: That was really helpful, thanks.TRISTAR: I don't understand what you mean.ME: Where is the elevator shaft?Tristar the mechanic leavesIt's like a combination of Starflight, when NPCs abruptly broke off conversation for no reason, presumably so you wouldn't learn everything in one sitting, and the open-ended dialog of the Origin titles.The dialog isn't completely open-ended, unfortunately.Alien Fires chooses to sacrifice what could be a pretty awesome dialog system with stuff like this, though:I could have happily gone my entire CRPG career without a W.K.R.P. reference. Alas, it was not to be.I encountered these three entities within just a couple of minutes of wandering the initial corridors (by the way, if you swear at them, they attack you and you die; I know you were all wondering). So far, I've gotten that I need to talk to Whitey in the bar on Level 2.Now let's talk about the game's problems. Aside from the story issues (and the seeming randomness of your starting point), the interface is horrible. Commands are through the function keys, which probably made sense on some keyboard but which is fairly impossible on my laptop without looking first. (Yes, I know DOSBox has a keyboard mapper. I don't know why, but I can't get it to work. Everything I do just ends up disabling the keys.) Second, even in DOSBox cranked up to some CPU speed 100 times what was available in 1987, the corridors take a few seconds to redraw each time you move. Since people and droids draw last, you usually find yourself blazing past them, and you have to keep stopping and turning around. The continual scrolling alternates between being unresponsive and way too  responsive. I hit the right or left arrows and  nothing happens, so I hold them down for a couple seconds and I end up  spinning in place for five or six revolutions.It may be that none of these things are the creators' faults, and just an issue with playing the game on modern platforms, but it still reduces my enthusiasm for slogging through however many hours of this.I do have my first quest, though. I encountered this rabbit/horse thing smoking a pipe and told him I wanted a weapon.There you have it. The fate of the universe hangs in the balance, and I'm off to find a pocket watch for the pipe-smoking rabbit-horse so I can defend all creation with a hunting knife.

But the truth is, coming up with an original CRPG plot is hard. There are only a few that pull it off very well: Ultima IV, maybe some of the Might & Magic titles, Baldur's Gate II.This is why I got excited about Bourbon Street Tango, the adventure I decided I would construct using the Adventure Construction Set. I started thinking about it when I saw that ACS offered a \"spy/mystery\" builder set. There are so few CRPGs set in the modern day, I figured I'd build one using New Orleans, 2010, as my canvas.\u00a0 I worked out a fairly cool plot line involving terrorism. I don't want to say more, lest I decide to develop it using a different builder, but let's just say that downtown NOLA was going to be cut off from the rest of world and rife with bad guys. Fortunately, ACS provides an option for this:\"KGB agent.\" Isn't that cute?One of the drawbacks of setting a CRPG in the \"real world\" is a lack of magic, right? Well, I had that covered. This is New Orleans, after all. My idea was that to solve the main quest, the protagonist was going to have to get into the heart and soul of the city, learning about jazz, Cajun cuisine, and of course voodoo! Why shoot terrorists when you can hex them?A lot of the work that goes into constructing an adventure in ACS has to do with creating a gameworld and editing the terrain. My idea was to reconstruct the French Quarter, with entrances to the various clubs and shops.I was about this time that I realized that the interface for Adventure Construction Set, while groundbreaking in its era, was far too much a pain in the neck for the modern gamer; that if I kept working on this, I wouldn't get to my next CRPG for weeks; and that even if I finished it, all I would have to show for my efforts was a module for a mid-1980s CRPG that almost no one would play. There are some things that aren't even worth the historical curiosity value.So I'm going to keep my notes, and keep working on the idea, but probably save it for a later toolset. I appreciate all of you who said you'd play if I made it, but constructing CRPGs isn't what I'm addicted to, and it's not why you all come and read this blog.

Found a secret door that led me to a weapon called Repeller:\u00a0 2. Used said weapon to defeat Yam the dragon.\u00a0 3. Got from Yam's corpse the third of three tablets I needed to figure out how to survive the endgame. Here they are crudely pieced together in Word:\u00a0 4. Followed Gilgamesh's path o'er hill and dale, and through a poisoned lake (that's where the cedar poles came in handy) to meet none other than Utnapishtim, the Babylonian analog to Noah:\u00a0 5. Followed Utnapishtim's instructions to get a mysterious plant called a \"Gray Grow Young.\"\u00a0 6. Hiked back across the Sinai Peninsula and explored some pyramids, including one that took me into a mysterious valley called \"Two Hero Valley.\"Unfortunately, the name of the Valley didn't turn out to be a metaphor. You see, Adventure Construction Set allows you to have multiple characters active in the game world at the same time. I didn't see any point to it, but now it's clear that it's the only way to win the game.\u00a0 Maddictra is stuck in her side of the valley now, and I need a second hero to come along and open a passage on the other side. Regrettably, this means creating a second character, and building him up enough to get the equipment he needs to cross the Sinai Peninsula to meet up with Maddictra. Am I willing to invest that kind of time? If it was a better game, maybe. As it is, no.I tried looking for a walkthrough, but \"Rivers of Light\" seems to be the exception to the rule that every game has one. The best I found--and this is actually quite good--is a series of YouTube videos made by user \"I Played a Thing.\" He's playing on an Amiga, so the graphics look different (i.e., better), but the gameplay is identical. (For some reason, he has chosen to call his character \"Fire\" and has an icon representing fire.) He reaches my stuck point at 06:26 in the video below. His reaction is identical to mine: \"That is some bull$&%, Rivers of Light!\"He was willing to do what I'm not: take the several hours to make a second character and haul him over to the valley, so if you want to see how it ends, keep watching his videos. The summary is that you work your way through a series of gates in a valley-cum-dungeon along the Nile, ultimately meeting the Egyptian god Osiris face-to-face in his tomb.Stolen from \"I Played a Thing's\" video.\u00a0 There, you are reunited with the souls of your seven past lives and \"born again\" in a \"land of milk and honey,\" according to the text anyway. In the game itself, it appears you are kicked unceremoniously back into the Fertile Crescent with no further talk of eternal life.Well, sorry I missed that for myself.Let me do a quick GIMLET on this game: I give it 7 points for the game world; it's the only game I know that draws on Mesopotamian mythology, and it's quite well-researched at that. (In fact, I should add an addendum to my \"What Have You Learned?\" posting, 'cause this game really fleshed out my knowledge of the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Babylonian pantheon.) Apparently, this was a common modus operandi for developer Stuart Smith, who also created Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves and Return of Hercules, neither of which I played because they didn't receive a DOS port.Your presence doesn't do much in the game world, though--one character continues to whine about the various threats in Assur long after you've slain them all.Chin up, buddy. You only have trolls to worry about!Character creation is down at a 4; all you get to select is your name and icon during the creation process, but character development uses a fairly good skills-based system. NPC Interaction gets a 2; there are many NPCs, and you learn from them, but there is no \"interaction\" per se. Encounters are more interesting than you'd expect, with a variety of foes, some of whom flee when wounded. They respawn, allowing lots of opportunities for skill-building, but no real depth to the encounters. Let's say 4.Magic doesn't exist, as such. You get spells, but they only work in limited circumstances to accomplish a particular thing; there are no real tactics to the combat, so we're going with a 2 on this category. There isn't much equipment in the game, and none of it is well-described. Having weapons and armor occasionally break is more annoying than challenging. The game is interesting for being one of the early ones to assign a weight-based movement statistic, but I wouldn't say this \"adds\" much to the game. I give it a 3.The economy is based on barley, which you can't accumulate much of because it's too heavy, and there's not much to buy anyway (1); there are no side quests, just steps on a main quest that, while original, has no real fulfillment in the end. There's also only one potential outcome and no replayability (2). Graphics are not distractingly bad, but there's no sound, and at least for modern keyboards, the interface sucks (2).The Fertile Crescent setting is unique, a least.\u00a0 Finally, on gameplay, although you can theoretically explore the entire game map from the outset, in reality you need to visit the various cities and dungeons in a specific order to progress through the game. Until the moment it throws the \"two heroes\" curveball at you, the game is fairly easy but not overly so, and it is reasonably brief. But there is no replayability to it (3).Final Score: 30. It was brief enough that I would have finished it if it hadn't been for the game's sudden surprise, but it wasn't enjoyable enough that I mind watching the end on someone else's video.I'll play with the \"construction\" part of the software and then move on to Alien Fires.*****Nearly 5 years after abandoning the game because of \"Two Hero Valley,\" I returned to it and won.

With the proceeds, I was able to buy my first armor, a \"billowy shirt.\" I found a cache of bee honeycombs that each sold for 20 sacks of barley (the unit of currency in this game), with the drawback that I can only carry one at a time and have to fight a bear every time. Nonetheless, I collected and sold enough to outfit myself with a proper sword.One of the game's several stores.My swimming skill enabled me to cross the Tigris river to the city-state of Great Assur (which you may remember from high school as the capital of ancient Assyria).I'm not sure trolls were part of Assyrian mythology.A woodsman told me of several regional problems, including a statue of a winged bull that recently came to life, and a fearful beast called Humbaba. It's nice when all of your side-quests in a given area are announced at the outset. Other plaques and people nearby fleshed out the backstories of these three threats.The winged bull statue turns out to have been a representation of Shedu, a Babylonian deity. Shamash, the God of Justice in Babylonia, brought it to life, and it flew off with the doorman to the Royal Library, along with the doorman's key. Shedu proved to be a bit difficult. It killed me a bunch of times before I decided to retire to the original area and boost my skills a bit before attempting it again. In the midst of this, I discovered that some \"red clay clods\" I had previously found actually boost your health significantly before battle. Using one of these, Shedu became a bit easier. Oddly, it respawned after I killed it, but I didn't need to fight it again since I had found on the first corpse the Royal Key.Humbaba is mentioned in the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh as a giant guarding the Cedar Forest who is slain by the hero. The first few times I approached him, he killed me with  a spell, but after I received a sun amulet from the god Shamesh by leaving some bee honey on his altar, I was able to kill him, and I got a cedar pole in return. No idea what this is about.The dragon is called Yam, a Canaanite god of river and sea. According to Wikipedia, he is associated with storms and storm-related disasters. Although not specifically described as a dragon in Canaanite mythology, Wikipedia says his analog in Babylonian mythology is Tiamat, who of course becomes a dragon in Dungeons & Dragons mythology. A plaque in the game told me he could only be defeated through a \"weapon of Sir Adroit and Cunning's.\" Having no idea where to find this, I was forced to move on.In the library--which turned out to be none other than Assyrian King Assurbanipal's Great Library of Knowledge (which still survives today as a ruin in Nineveh)--I exchanged the Royal Key for a spell called \"Shabrir Begone\" and some of my grain for a broken tablet, which read: \"To pass the first gate, one must take a regal key to the glyph room. There one must... [the rest garbled].\" More important, I read a series of tapestries recording messages from the great god Ea that heretics have stolen \"three great shapes\" and used them \"as profane keys of passage through a mysterious trio of gates.\" There's also a note about Gilgamesh, who was seeking the secret of immortality himself to heal his friend Enkidu; and also one about Utnapishtim, who saved humanity from the Great Flood and now lives forever. Sounds like I'm getting closer to my quest!In the Arabian Desert, I killed a bandit and took his camel, which allowed me to cross the Sinai peninsula into Egypt. Crossing the Sinai Desert meant staying constantly hydrated, which was tough because the water along the way was possessed by Shabriri demons; fortunately, I had the \"Shabriri Begone\" spell from the library and was able to force them to take physical form and kill them.On the other side of the Sinai, I found the great pyramid at Gizeh, rife with thieves who stole everything not nailed down, including my camel.The pyramid held so many references to different mythologies (including a pre-Mummy shout-out to Imhotep) that even I got sick of looking them up on Wikipedia. This is where I left the game for the night.Two notes on gameplay, though, that I missed to tell you in my first posting on Adventure Construction Set: first, there are two types of weapons, melee and missile. For melee weapons, I've gone through a large bone, a flint knife, a sword, and now an iron sword. For missile weapons, I've found rocks and bows. You have an associated skill with each that increases as you score hits.Second, this is the first game I know (although I'm probably just forgetting one) to attach a weight to the items in your inventory. There's a little \"movement\" bar on the left-hand side of the screen that gets shorter as you carry more stuff. Eventually, you can't move unless you drop some of it. Unfortunately, it counts your barley (the game's currency) as weight, so you can't get too rich.My melee skill has already maxed out at 100, which is a good sign that the game isn't going to last that much longer. If the next post is a \"Won!\" you'll know I was right."}, {"title": "Game 29: Adventure Construction Set (1984)", "date": "Saturday, October 30, 2010", "text": "Tintagel?It turns out I'm about three years off on this one. My general rule is to play games in order of their original publication, not in order of their DOS release. In this case, I mis-coded the game in my master spreadsheet. It probably worked out for the best because it's not on Wikipedia's list, meaning I would have missed it on the first pass and probably would have relegated it to one of my July \"backtracking\" posts. Now I can give it the proper attention.The primary purpose of Adventure Construction Set is to allow prospective dungeon masters to create their own CRPGs and offer them up to their friends. According to Wikipedia's entry on the software, it was inspired by the Pinball Construction Set from 1983. ACS was first released for the Commodore 64 in 1984; the DOS version (which I'm playing) came out in 1987. Its age shows after three years, unfortunately, as the interface is a bit clumsy and the commands and graphics not nearly as robust as some of the other 1987 CRPG offerings.We have yet to see a spy/mystery CRPG in this blog.I wouldn't normally play Adventure Construction Set as part of this blog except that it came pre-packaged with at least one pre-made adventure called \"Rivers of Light.\" I say \"at least one\" because all of the other write-ups mention only \"Rivers of Light,\" while the main menu seems to offer a second one called \"Land of Aventuria.\" I'll check that out after I finish \"Rivers of Light.\"You press INS to continue a lot in this game.\"Rivers of Light\" involves nothing less than the quest for eternal life--no pretense about making the world a better place for this PC. The character creation process is a bit odd: you can select your character's icon from a large variety of different warriors, wizards, monsters, and objects, but you don't get to customize anything about his or her attributes; the game rolls these automatically for you.Some of the available character icons.You begin with no equipment in the middle of a colorful landscape in what I suppose is the Fertile Crescent. (Those must be the Tigris and Euphrates rivers running by the cities of...Baghdad and...um...Ur?)  The annoying aspect to the interface is that you have to keep hitting the INSERT key where you would normally expect to type ENTER. I'm sure this was optimized for some early IBM keyboard, but it doesn't work well with my laptop. One would think I could edit the DOSBox keyboard mapper to help me with this problem, but I seem to be having issues with it. I'm sure I'll figure it out.The game is organized into a series of screens. You transition between screens via little \"cave\" icons. Fairly quickly in my adventures, a series of related quests became clear: a hunter has lost his statue of the Mother Goddess and needs a replacement; an old woman in a cave will fashion a likeness of the Mother Goddess if I drop an animal bone on her altar; a nearby troll wields an animal bone as a weapon.Putting all of this together yields the acquisition of \"swimming skill\"  from the hunter, allowing me to swim across rivers. Oddly, this skill  appears in your inventory as an \"object\" that you \"use.\"As you kill creatures, move about, and solve quests, your various skills increase. I was recently lauding 2400 A.D. for offering the first skills-based character progression that I'd seen, but I guess Adventure Construction Set beat it by a few years. Your life force (hit points) regenerates as you move around.In the first hour of gameplay, I haven't died, and my dress-clad female  PC, armed with a flint knife, has managed to do her share of  ass-kicking, but a comment a reader left on a previous game leads me to  expect an increase in difficulty soon. So far, the best I can say about the game is that it's \"inoffensive.\" I don't expect a title marketed primarily as an adventure-builder to yield major rewards in the single-player campaign department, but who knows?

United StatesOrigin Systems (developer and publisher)Released 1988 for Apple II and DOSDate Started: 14 October 2010Date Ended: 22 October 2010Total Hours: 8Difficulty: Easy-Moderate (2.5/5) Final Rating: 34Ranking at Time of Posting: 16/28 (57%) Ranking at Game #453: 325/453 (72%)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Again, I find myself in conflict with Dungeons & Desktops author Matt Barton, who says, \"2400 A.D. is a very creative game that should have been a great deal more successful\" (p. 122).I'll give him that the game is creative. There aren't many sci-fi RPGs  out there, and this one creates a relatively interesting story, a  different landscape full of things you generally don't see in CRPGs:  moving walkways, subways, transport tubes. The weapons and equipment  are unique, and the method of attribute development is rare for the era.  Reading a walkthrough  later, I realized I barely used half of the equipment available, which  included holograph generators that confuse robots and various weapons  that stun them.But I can guess why it's not successful: it's a bit boring. While I love the Ultima IV-style dialog, and I like games that make you rely on NPCs for clues, there are too many NPCs  in too tight an area with too few things to say. As for the variety of  equipment, most is unnecessary, since the robots fall quite willingly to  a few basic weapons. Once you have the plasma rifle, the game is  basically over.Let's break it down on the GIMLET scale:1. Game world. We have to give 2400 A.D.  credit for a unique game world and a somewhat interesting back story  covered in the type of thickly-written manual that only Origin could  produce. The thing I noticed is the back story could have been written a  bunch of different ways without changing the gameplay. For instance, instead of an alien race called the \"Tzorg\" taking over the colony and staffing it with robots, it could have been a robot revolution against human rule. The Tzorg,  after all, are oddly absent from things. (By the way, Barton has a  mistake here, calling the enemies as \"alien robots called the Tzorg\"; the robots are creations of the Tzorg, not Tzorg  themselves.) Anyway, your character and quest are quite clear. Nothing  you do changes the game world much, though, until the end. Final score: 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If there's one thing Origin excels at, it's game manuals.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. Character creation and development.  I give the game credit for its use-based attribute development. Your  energy (strength) goes up by repeatedly running and climbing, and your  IQ by fixing your broken equipment, and so on. I can't think of an  earlier game that builds your skills this way, a system that will be  seen again in the Quest for Glory series and will reach full potential in The Elder Scrolls  games. Everything else about character development is fairly basic.  There are no choices in character type, alignment, and so on. Treating  strength and hit points as the same thing is a bit odd. Final score: 4.3. NPC interaction. As I said, I have a weakness for the handful of games, almost all Origin Systems titles, where you speak to NPCs by typing keywords. And 2400 A.D. is full of NPCs,  most of whom are necessary to find your way along the main quest. They  have very little to say, unfortunately, and your dialog with them  doesn't offer real choices or opportunities for role-playing. Final score: 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4. Encounters & foes.  There are a bunch of different types of robots, basically  distinguishable only by icons and how much damage they do. They die too  easily and offer little challenge. Most of the encounters are random,  though, and foes do respawn. Final score: 3.5. Magic & combat. There's no magic system in the game, and combat is a rote matter of hitting (a)ttack  and pressing a direction. Except in a few cases, where it's good to use  obstacles and corridors to limit how many enemies can attack you, there  are really no tactics in combat. Final score: 2.6. Equipment.  There are a handful of weapons, three armor choices, and some other  equipment in the game. Some of the items are unusual and fun, like time  bombs and holograph projectors. I didn't see any need for pass cards and  zone access cards; you can just sneak around zones and bash robots.  Other than that, nothing terribly special. Final score: 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Donovan uses his jetpack for no other reason than he can.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7. Economy.  You need about 7000 credits to get the equipment necessary to win the game,  obtained 0-99 at a time from each robot slain. After that, money builds  up for no reason. Final score: 3.8. Quests. There is but one main quest with no twists. No side-quests. The main quest has one outcome and no role-playing opportunities. Final score: 2.9. Graphics, sound, inputs. The game features basic keyboard controls. The graphics are good enough for the gameplay, although the grey boxes around the sprites are distracting. Sound is still in the better-to-play-it-silent era. Final score: 3.10. Gameplay. Within the world, gameplay  is fairly non-linear, allowing you to go wherever from the start. But  the world is small and confining, so it's not as if you can use the  non-linearity to really wander and explore. Overall, it is too easy (you  cannot die!), too quick, and not in any way replayable. Final score: 2.This gives us a total score for 2400 A.D. of: 34. That puts it in the range of Shard of Spring, which I once described as \"meh.\" That's pretty much how I feel about 2400 A.D.The  next game is an interesting one: a construction set that comes with a  playable single-player module. I'm ready for something new."}, {"title": "2400 A.D.: Won!", "date": "Friday, October 22, 2010", "text": "You have to wonder what kind of security system allows all the robots to be destroyed by entering three words.Well, that was a bit anticlimactic. At the end of my last 2400 A.D. posting, I suggested that I thought the game would be a quick one. I was right. I continued wandering through the streets of Metropolis, killing robots, building my statistics, and making money. I visited each building and got all the available clues from the denizens. The picture that emerged was that to win, I would need to:Visit several computer consoles under the administration building, enter a code, and get each of three \"deactivation codes.\"Sneak in to the Authority Complex through a maze that began in the junk yard, fighting robots and solving puzzles along the way.Find my way to the top level of the Authority Complex and enter the three deactivation codes.To accomplish all of this, I needed several pieces of equipment:A field disperser, the best armor in the game, which also allows the wearer to pass through force fieldsA plasma rifle, the best weapon in the game (I'm not sure if it has a 40-watt range).A transporter guidance device to make my way through a transporter mazeA jetpack, to get over some obstaclesOne by one, I collected the clues and visited the locations to find these items. The plasma rifle was most difficult. I wasn't sure where to get it, but I sort-of lucked into it after I bought several lesser weapons from Wes the weapons dealer.He ended up just giving me the plasma rifle, but it was broken. I took it to Hugo in the repair shop, and he outlined what I needed.These spare parts came from a couple of electronics dealers. Once I had it, I was unstoppable, to both robots and doors. I broke in to the Social Rehabilitation Center just to slaughter the robot guards and speak to the prisoners.The field disperser was a bit easier, requiring only that I find a set of blueprints and pay an absurd amount of money to a guy named \"Les\" to make the armor.I picked up the other items along the way, too, but didn't take screen shots. It wasn't all that exciting. The game was far too easy by this point--no robot could really damage me, and they all died in just a couple of shots.A random pop culture reference. Origin likes these.Perhaps knowing that robots were no longer a challenge, the game threw some different puzzles at me as I explored the depths of the Administration Center, looking for the deactivation codes.First there was a moving sidewalk maze. I didn't bother with it; I just fired up my jetpack and flew over it.Then we had a maze that required me to shove crates around until I found the path to the computer terminal. It took a little time, but we're not talking Wizardry IV-level difficulty, here.Once I had the codes, it was a simple matter to sneak into the Authority Complex, work my way to the top, and enter the deactivation codes into the main console. I took a video of the last five minutes, starting with the end of a battle with some reasonably difficult robots.The greatest disappointment? I never got to see what a Tzorg looked like! I guess they're saving that for the sequel.Alas, according to Wikipedia, the sequel--2500 A.D. (guess it took the Tzorg a while to get there)--was canceled in development.If this whole post seems a little lackluster, that reflects my feelings about the game. Maybe it was what I needed after Wizardry IV, but it was horribly easy and quick. I'll do a quick summary posting next and then hopefully head on to something more challenging."}, {"title": "2400 A.D.: Die Hard", "date": "Thursday, October 21, 2010", "text": "Soy-278 is robots! I've gotten the hang of 2400 A.D., and it isn't too hard, particularly given that (as far as I can tell) you cannot die. If robots shoot you enough, you fall unconscious and you wake up in the Social Rehab Center. As some of my readers pointed out in my last posting, this isn't so bad. If you search around, you find a secret door that lets you escape into the underground, at which point you can find your way to the surface.Now, you don't have any of your equipment, but a helpful hint from a guy named Guido......clued me in to where I could go and find it. There's no security on it or anything:So \"dying\" and going to rehab actually becomes useful at some points. It certainly isn't any detriment that I can see--you don't lose any statistics, and you even have your check-in timer reset--so the only drawback is that it's a slight pain in the neck wandering out of jail.This is a good thing, because I was shot unconscious about 20 times tonight as I explored the city of Metropolis. First of all, the quest advanced as I returned to Spider with the password, was given some equipment (including a better blaster), and advised to find out about the underground.On my way to the underground, I was pursued by another Follower. I got sick of him shadowing me, and I shot him dead. This turned out to be an extraordinary bit of luck because I haven't been able to kill another Follower since.When a robot \"dies,\" nothing in the game tells you it's dead; it just stops moving. I didn't realize this the first time, so I kept shooting and shooting it until my weapon broke. Then I realized he wasn't shooting back, and I searched him for a cool 8 credits.As you fight, run, climb, talk to people, and repair weapons in this game, your energy (strength), agility, IQ, and affinity increase. This is the first game I can think of in which your ability scores increase through use instead of through magical means or allocating experience points to them.In the Underground.In the Underground (literally an area beneath the city you access via ladders), I was recruited into the Rebellion by someone named \"Pinkie\" and given a list of individuals to consult. As I did in Ultima IV, I've been taking careful notes of character locations and clues. The game is similar to Ultima IV in that you speak to characters by typing keywords, and often you get a clue from one character to mention something in particular to another. It is dissimilar to Ultima IV in that the characters don't have as much to say, and they don't respond to standard keywords like NAME, JOB, and HEALTH.My growing clues file.The clues are telling me a little about a secret entrance to the Authority Complex, and code words I'll need to shut down the robot servers--the game's main quest.As I explore and talk to people, I've also been finding out about different modes of transportation in the City of Metropolis. First, you can walk anywhere, obviously. But there's also a conveyor belt that reaches most of the parts of the town, and a subway that runs underneath it. Finally, there are occasional transporters that you need a code word to use, but I just got it: LETSGO.\"Now, did he ever return? No, he never returned...\"My main goal now is to make some money and upgrade my weapons, armor, and equipment, and the only way I've found to make money is by killing robots. After numerous attempts and subsequent sojourns in the Rehab Center, I thought to consult the book, and I realized there are different \"levels\" of robots. Right now, I can basically only take on Level 1:If I limit myself to \"police\" robots and \"sentry\" robots, I've actually been doing pretty well. Here's a shot of me looting the bodies of two police robots:Boo-ya.I'm up to about 500 credits, but good weapons and armor cost in the thousands, so I have a long way to go. My plan right now is to keep exploring, talking, and killing, and see where it gets me.

I'm just going to share a few discoveries and promise a longer post tomorrow.1. The \"T\" value is a countdown timer that tells you how long you have to check in with the \"Registration.\" If you let it get to 0 all the robots turn hostile and attack you. In the world of 2400 A.D., you're like a sex offender: you have to keep registering with the authorities to be legal.Am I Level 2 or 3?2. There are little power cells on corners (they look a bit like round mirrors), at which you can charge your weapons and devices. But apparently this is illegal, because if the robots see you they will attack you.I shot something. It didn't do me much good.3. You are restricted to certain \"Zones\" of the city. If you stray outside your zone, and a robot catches you, you get a \"social demerit.\" Collect enough social demerits and the robots attack you.4. There are really annoying robots called \"followers\" that, you guessed it, mercilessly follow you around. One of them trapped me in a corner and I had to re-load.Try being a leader.5. It doesn't appear that you can die in this game--at least, not through regular robot attacks. Instead, you fall unconscious and wake up in \"the Social Rehabilitation Center.\" There's a locked door here, which I managed to bash open, only to immediately encounter a robot that shot me unconscious, and I woke up in...the Social Rehabilitation Center.Vicious cycle, that.But among the discoveries, I found a couple pieces of wisdom. First, thanks to the surface map that we decided last week I was allowed to have, I found Johnny's Bar and talked to Reggie, who gave me the Resistance password.Apparently, he'll give it to anyone who walks up to him and says \"password.\"The second bit of information I got from a guy in a house that I entered to escape the Follower robot. He found some reference to a device that would protect people from force fields.And that, unfortunately, is it for the evening. Again, a longer post tomorrow after I've had a chance to explore for a solid 3-4 hours. Oh, here's that surface map. It doesn't look like a very big game, but then some of these houses have multiple levels.

There was a bit of a fight involved, but I managed to bring my laptop along on the trip, on the grounds that I had assignments to finish up for some of my online classes.She would surely notice if I was using this time to play games, so I can't make any progress on 2400 A.D., but I think I'm safe tapping out a \"special topics\" posting.When I first started this blog, I had no idea what I would think about most of the games I encountered, but I had a decent idea (I thought) what I would say about certain games I'd already played. So in between postings on older games like Akalabeth and Wizardry I, I began writing little snippets that I could plug into my reviews of newer games when I finally got to them. How naive I was. I realize now that I'm years away from playing any of these games, and by the time I get there, I'll likely have a very different perspective.So I'm offering these snippets to you here. See if you can guess what games I'm talking about from the brief descriptions.1. I have attempted this game no less than four times previously, each time giving up in disgust after about 16 hours, and each time--some months or years down the line--thinking to myself, \"How bad could it have been? After all, it was made by the same people who made the Gold Box games and it has the same type of combat. Give it another try.\" The particularly annoying thing is that each of my rage-quits has been accompanied by a fierce hurling of the game disks into the trash, with an equally fierce determination never to play the game again. This means that I've actually bought this absurd game four times. I probably account for 15% of its total sales.2. This game starts off right, with a mystery about your missing equipment that gives you a de facto side quest list in the first five minutes. You then almost immediately encounter a location that makes an obscure but delightful reference to a much earlier game in the series. The first act is fairly linear, sure, but also very interesting, with numerous plot twists and memorable locations. But as you journey from place to place to place, you start to notice something: the game takes forever. It's about six times as long as its predecessor. More important, it involves about six times as much combat, which is particularly annoying because they haven't changed the combat engine, under which enemies respawn the moment you travel 50 feet away, and under which your characters are equally likely to run off screaming into the woods, or stumble into the path of one of your own ranged weapons, as they are to do anything useful.3. The game engine might be the same as its predecessors, but the creators have done simply delightful things with dialog options. When speaking with any of the town's many NPCs, your choices vary considerably depending on race, class, intelligence, and charisma. There are even places when some characters can comment on what other characters have done--for instance, if your thief burgles a home, your paladin can apologize to the owner and promise to punish him. And speaking of paladins: don't let them speak to anyone who gave you a quest if you want to get paid!4. Although the extra material tells an interesting story, this is one game for which an expansion pack was utterly unnecessary. The game world was already huge, and by the time you're strong enough to explore the expansion material, the last thing you want to do is fiddle with new weapon types, new spell ingredients, new types of companions, and new methods of transportation. Your character will probably already be maxed out by the time you visit the new locations, reducing the game to a tedious exercise in walloping dozens of enemies with the best weapon you can find just so you can advance to the next plot point.5. The game is a worthy finale to one of the greatest CRPG series of all time, but it's not without problems. First, it's disappointingly linear, requiring you to finish off your foes in a very specific order. Second, to get the most out of the game, you must visit a location and solve a series of quests that you have absolutely no in-game excuse to visit or solve. Finally, it introduces a seemingly-good character who turns out to be the game's arch-villain, only anyone with an IQ of a doorknob would see through the character's guise during the first encounter.6. The game has all the great gameplay elements of its two predecessors, but it falls apart in the third act. After spending most of the game building your characters, you find that with a combination of flight, speed, and invisibility, you can simply blow past the enemies in each of the final dungeons, solving the game without a single fight. This is anticlimactic to say the least.7. This is simply the greatest CRPG I have ever played. It has everything: solid character development, a fascinating backstory, thoroughly-described weapons and armor, memorable foes, detailed dialog options with both friends and enemies, interesting NPCs (each with a unique story, and some with a quest to go along), great graphics and sound (including movie-quality voice acting), and a mostly non-linear approach that allows you to explore nearly the entire game world immediately after the prologue (although the main quest progresses in a fairly linear fashion).I'll name my next protagonist after whoever gets the most.Vacation will be over on Monday, and I'll head back to Nova Athens then.****10/20/2010 edit with answers:1. Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor. It could have been so much better. Truth be told, I find it tolerable at the opening stages, but the hundredth time you're trying to get through a dungeon and you suddenly find yourself in combat with zombies moving at the pace of drunken sloths, you rip the CD out of the drive and break it in two. Good job to Adamantyr on that one. Based on some of the other comments, I'm really not looking forward to Spelljammer.2. Ultima VII, Part 2. There didn't seem to be any confusion about this. I like the game, but it way overstays its welcome.3. Icewind Dale II. Good job to Anonymous and Elzair. I love the beginning stages for the dialog options and a lot of humor and intrigue in the quests. It becomes much less interesting and more linear later.4. Morrowind: Tribunal, although I agree that this could just as easily refer to Blood Moon or the Shivering Isles expansion to Oblivion. Well done Calibrator, Acrin1, and Elzair. By the time I made it to this expansion, I would have been happy if they'd just summarized the plot in one of the game's books.5. Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal. The dungeon I refer to is Watcher's Keep. There's never a point in the game in which it makes sense to delay your intercession in Armageddon to go wandering off on this side quest. It could have been integrated better in the rest of the game. And honestly, was anyone fooled by Melissan?6.  Might & Magic VIII. I loved VI and VII. By VIII, the game engine was a bit stale, but the game was still fun. But you hardly have to do anything in the final third of the game except run from one place to another.7. Baldur's Gate, the original. No one got this, but I suppose these qualities could easily apply to a few other games. Even 13 years old, BG1 is the closest to CRPG perfection as I can imagine. But, of course, I haven't played all the others yet.Bonus point to Zink for knowing that none of my snippets referred to Oblivion.Looks like I have my whole roster for Phantasie III.mprod, please feel free to post when you're sober."}, {"title": "Game 28: 2400 A.D. (1987)", "date": "Thursday, October 14, 2010", "text": "Lord British's jester found time to make a game.With this posting, we move into a new year: 1987. This is important because the years pass slowly these days. 1983 had three games; 1984 had only five. But 1986 had 11, and 1987 has 22. I'm sure they'll stop doubling eventually, but from now on, any time a new year rolls around, it's a major event.2400 A.D. takes place at some unspecified point in the future on a planet technically known as XK-120 but called \"Nova Athens\" by the residents. Colonized by Earth for its mining potential, it became a major center for learning and culture, but over the course of a few decades it was conquered--along with many other Earth colonies--by an alien race called the Tzorg. To keep order among the human populace of Nova Athens, and in its capital city of Metropolis, the Tzorg staffed the planet with robot patrols. Although the planet still nominally functions, it has gone to seed, and an underground Resistance network works to find and deactivate the robots' control center.You play a computer specialist who has been reassigned to Nova Athens from another Tzorg-controlled colony. Somehow the Resistance has gotten you a member's journal detailing a member's attempts to infiltrate the center, and a recent project to build a secret underground tunnel to the center. Attached to the journal is a desperate note encouraging you to find someone named \"Spider.\" After allocating 99 points to energy, IQ, agility, and \"affinity\" (basically charisma), you are dumped into the middle of Metropolis.The desperate plea that starts the game.The game was developed by \"Chuckles\" at Origin Systems, and its lineage shows. The interface is very reminiscent of Ultima IV, with a top-down map occupying one half of the screen and dialog and game notes occupying the other half. Commands and movement are entirely through the keyboard, of course, with easy-to-remember actions like \"(a)ttack\" and \"(g)et.\"And there's dialog like Ultima IV! At least, with some of the characters, there is. Others just say one thing, like in Ultima III. Unfortunately, the dialog is tough to get into. The characters aren't like the friendly inhabitants of Britannia--they don't respond to inquiries about NAME, HEALTH, and JOB. You have to know more about what to say. But I did already get a clue from a guy named Eddie at a lunch counter that the enigmatic \"Spider\" is at Joe's Bar.\"Left\" and \"right\" are tough concepts in a top-down game.I found Joe's Bar easy enough, but it took me a good 15 minutes of screwing around to figure out that the way to get into the \"back\" of the bar to see Spider was to (C)limb over the bar itself. I can tell that the interface is going to take some getting used to. Anyway, Spider wants me to find someone named Reggie at Jonnie's Corner and get a password from him.Yes! We all want to change the world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After leaving the bar, I got stuck in an alleyway between some kid and an innocuous-looking robot (these robots flit about and look so harmless it's hard to believe I'm going to be shooting them soon).Hey, it's called \"personal space.\" Check it out.\u00a0 Since at this point in the game, I didn't have an energy pack for my weapon, and since neither of my companions seemed inclined to move, I started to get pretty steamed at what I thought was an idiotic design interface. But it turned out the solution was, again, to (c)limb over them. Seems pretty rude, but it worked.Now notice the number after the \"T\" in the screenshot above. This value started at something like 2000 and has been steadily counting down, second-by-second, since then. What happens when it gets to 0? Do I have to enter 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 into the interface?I'm also wondering if I ever get to meet a Tzorg. The manual suggests that the Tzorgs took off and left the planet in the care of their robot servants. I'd like to know what they look like.Going from Wizardry IV to 2400 A.D. feels a bit like stalking away from a chess tournament to go play tick-tack-toe. Maybe it gets a lot harder--after all, I've yet to fire a weapon--but something about the interface is lulling me into a feeling that it's an easy game. We'll see how it goes.

Apparently, there are several possible endings: one \"good,\" three \"evil,\" and one \"grandmaster.\" The \"good\" ending occurs after you wander into a pool that changes your alignment; you can then pass a challenge from the various dukes of the kingdom to become their (benevolent) overlord. The three \"evil\" endings have you challenging the god Kadorto for the Amulet and becoming a god yourself (each of a different type depending on--of all things--the sword you choose in the altar room I described in the last post; I would have become a \"greedy and opulent God\").The \"grandmaster\" ending, as best I can tell, involves having the right artifacts when you challenge Kadorto and ultimately revealing him to be a fraud and the Amulet to be a thing of pure chaos crafted as a cosmic joke. You determine to send it back to its makers and then wander off down a path, footloose and fancy-free. Isn't that nice.If I hadn't quit now, you would have had a ranting, raving, psychotic posting from me in about a week, after I finally escaped the dungeon and tried to enter the castle above. Of this, the aforementioned walkthrough says:The password is 'TREBOR SUX'. (There is a clue to this in the Oracle's pronouncements, but even with that you need to be intimately familiar with the original Wizardry to get this one on your own.)Uh-huh. Apparently, this is some graffiti \"carved in stone\" (the Oracle's hint) in the original Wizardry. Well, it's not like I kept screenshots of everything in Wizardry I, so I would have had to go back and win Wizardry I again in order to progress in this game. And I would have had to start from the beginning, since it deleted my characters upon exporting them to Wizardry II. One thing you can say about the Wizardry franchise: it doesn't pull any punches.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The difficulty of the game is one thing, but what really killed my enthusiasm for Wizardry IV is that it doesn't include any of the elements that I like about CRPGs. Oh, it has an interesting back story, I grant you, and a very original approach. But there's virtually no character creation or development: you start off as the same Werdna every time, and you only \"develop\" by visiting successive pentagrams; there are no experience rewards for your eons of combat. There are no meaningful NPC encounters, no economy, only one pathological main quest, extremely linear gameplay, and an overall experience that's exasperating instead of challenging. It features some of the tactical combat intensity that I liked about the original Wizardry, but limited in that you can only control one character. The graphics and sound are an insult at this stage of CRPG development.I'm giving it a 30 on my GIMLET scale and moving on to 2400 A.D., but I do so with some remorse. Actually finishing this game, without cheats or walkthroughs, would have felt like a real accomplishment. Unfortunately, I just don't have that kind of patience.[Ed. I went back and finished the game in 2022.

At least 3/4 of the squares in the mostly wide-open dungeon are bombs that cost you 10 hits per step. There's a path that weaves through them but no way to discern the path without simply getting yourself bombed, mapping, and returning frequently to the summoning pentagram or using DIOS potions (which, fortunately, many of the denizens of the level drop). Absurdly, you can't tell your companion priests to heal you outside of combat, so if you don't have DIOS potions, you have to keep fighting to heal.Do you suppose in Europe, it says, \"Kablam! Flowers!\"? (Reference.)Some of the monsters you encounter are thieves, which kept stealing my magical stones. Paranoid that I would need these later, I got used to reloading after every such theft. Since this got old fast, I started saving after every few encounters, which in turn meant that I kept fighting the same groups of monsters over and over.Ooh, Arcturus's avengers. Again.At one point, I found my way to the exit. I nearly took off at this point, but I decided to painstakingly keep mapping the level, which is a good thing because I found two more precious stones in the middle of a bunch of mines. The one good thing is a \"black box\" that I got from an assassin; it allows me to store various items in it. I got complacent in the idea that this meant the items could no longer be stolen, which may be true, but it turns out that the entire black box can be stolen. I found this out after I had saved over the game, meaning that, yes, I had to start the game over from the beginning. (It went faster without the need for mapping.)The black box, which makes it easier for thieves to steal all your stuff at once.It would be nice to think that this was the hardest level in the game, but, really, what are the odds of that?Things improved a bit on Level 7. The map is in an interesting shape.The game plays with the fiction that you actually ascend in this \"ziggurat\" instead of going north. The yellow areas are ones that I couldn't explore because if I try to leave the immediate area of the ziggurat, I \"fall off a ledge\" and die.I'd like to know why they didn't call them gods right from the get-go.At the top of the ziggurat was an altar that allowed me to donate my magic stones. Only, the first time I donated the wrong one and got the message at the top of this entry, forcing me to start over at the beginning. The second time, I donated the other stones but the altar simply destroyed them. The third time, I \"invoked\" the stones first and the altar was happy. It gave me the choice of three swords of different colors. I had no idea--still have no idea--what the difference was, so I chose my favorite of the three and ended up with something called the West Wind Sword. I assume it will suck less than the dagger I was wielding up until then.Also at the top was what I think might be an homage to Zork III, although perhaps I'm just reading too much into it:It's dubious to me how \"scenic\" this could be in the depths of a dark dungeon.Through all of this exploring, I keep running in to a traveling \"oracle,\" who takes 2,500 gold from me for various clues. I don't mind spending the money, as I have tens of thousands of gold pieces and nothing else to buy. But the clues are singularly unhelpful. Here are the ones I've collected so far:\"The egress will set you free!\" (Yep, that's why they call it an \"egress.\")\"Your future is black; you feel boxed in!\" (Maybe 'cause I'm in a dungeon.)\"Read The Iliad lately?\" (The Iliad exists in the world of Wizardry?)\"Chomp, chomp...eh, what's east, Doc?\" (And apparently Bugs Bunny, too.)\"Secrets abound all around you! Psst! Have you met Glum yet?\" (Glum was an assassin on Level 8 who had the black box I mentioned.)\"Live the Qabalah!\" (If there's one thing lacking in most CRPGs, it's references to obscure pagan mysticism.)\"The answer is carved in stone. It is right before your nose!\"\"The temple holds an ancient secret.\"If there are actual clues to be teased out of these rantings, I'm not sure what they are. I am sure that I'm not going to read The Iliad again just for this game.I won't lie: I fired up 2400 A.D. for a few minutes just to see how I'd feel. But masochistic or not, I bailed on the last two Wizardry titles, so I feel honor-bound to keep with this one until it really starts to infuriate me.That might be soon. Level 6 is full of spinners.

People have been telling me over and over how awesome your fourth \"scenario\" is. \"The most challenging CRPG ever created,\" they say. I've spent months anticipating it, along the way making fun of games like Swords of Glass for their primitive programming. And this is what I've been waiting for?\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The same wire frame dungeons? The same monochromatic graphics? The same spells? The same commands?Sigh...well, what it lacks in originality in gameplay, it makes up in originality in story. Wizardry IV is called \"The Return of Werdna.\" I had this idea that Werdna (the villain from Wizardry I) had returned, and I would have to mount an expedition to defeat him again. Not so. Rather, in this game, you play as Werdna.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I think maybe I want a long, hot shower more.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 In the game manual, Werdna recounts how he craved the magical amulet from the first game, which had been left behind in an episode when gods were screwing around on the mortal plane but were chased away by some more powerful force. Trebor managed to snag the amulet first, but Werdna invaded his castle and stole it from him. He was learning to channel its power when the adventurers from the first game burst into his chambers and killed him...or so they thought. You have now woken up and need to escape a 10-level dungeon.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Should have gotten a higher deductible on that insurance! Bwu-ha-ha-ha-ha...wait, that doesn't really make sense.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Although the basic look and feel, combat, and commands are the same, there are significant differences from the previous Wizardry games. Some are good, some bad.There's no character creation. You immediately awaken as Werdna, at Level 1, a mage, with all of your attributes set to 9.You control only one character. On each level, there is at least one (maybe only one per level) \"summoning pentagram\" at which you can summon a variety of monsters to fight with you, but you can't control them or their inventories.I'm not sure I even want to know what Option A is.There's a \"real time\" aspect to the game. If you just stand still, you can still be subjected to a wandering encounter.You don't get any experience from combat! The only way Werdna \"levels up\" is to visit the next level and go to a summoning square. This is also, as far as I can tell, the only way to get healed and recharge your spells. Unlike previous titles, you can now save the game--in up to eight slots!--but saving resets the dungeon and its fixed encounters.The \"monsters\" you encounter are actually named heroes (Werdna keeps calling them \"do-gooders\") seeking to slay you.The game frequently comments in Werdna's voice or from Werdna's perspective. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Despite the fact that I have a printed manual, there's lots about the game I don't understand so far. First, the room that you start in has no door, and you essentially have to wander around until one of your summonsed priests thinks to cast the MILWA spell to see the secret door. Werdna doesn't have this spell. Is this intentional?Second, when you kill monsters, they drop weapons and armor, but as a mage you  generally can't use them. Since you also can't control the inventories  of your summoned creatures, I'm not sure what purpose they serve.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Not the most imaginative level map. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Tonight, I mapped Level 1 and went up to Level 2. I immediately saved it upon arrival, which turned out to be a big mistake. The encounters are suddenly much harder, only a couple of my monsters from Level 1 survived, and I don't know where the summoning pentagram is. I'm stuck between trying to find it (and getting slaughtered repeatedly) or going back to Level 1, battling back to the starting point, and using the pentagram again.When you die, you get returned to your crypt for another chance, although I don't consider it cheating to load the saved game at this point, since the game gives you the save option.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 So far, this game feels more like a goofy fan mod than something it took Sir-Tech five years to develop. I am pretty determined to win \"the most challenging CRPG of all time,\" though, so settle in for the long haul on this one.\"This adventure ends sour this failure. Too bad. This adventurer was nice. In their benevolence badge, the ancient gods were bearing the body of Marcel in a sanctuary...\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I got to the point last night where I started writing my first blog entry for Wizardry IV, but then I sat back and thought, \"CRPG Addict, people read your blog specifically to hear about games they might otherwise not play. And, honestly, how many of your readers are likely ever to play Tera?\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 So I went back to Tera, and wandered around some more. I came across the city of Kronopolis, which looks huge in the screenshot but actually has only three shops, apparently. Fortunately, the first two items need no translation. Unfortunately, I got an error every time I tried to buy something.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Only 50 ducats for a \"container of energy\"?!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ultimately, I wandered into the wrong place and ran into some sorcerers. The list of commands led me to believe that \"C\" was the way to engage in combatte, but everything I tried led to the game asking me things like \"\u00eates-vous un idiot?!\" and \"essayer autre chose\" before I quickly died.Look, I'm man enough for a challenge, like playing a game without any instructions, or playing a game in a foreign language. Just not together at the same time. And here's the other thing: I'm not entirely sure that Tera isn't really stupid. I mean, like Ultima II stupid.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Point de l'exposition\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So I'm going to move on to Wizardry IV for now, but I'll think about giving Tera another try if someone comes up with a manual (one that doesn't require telechargement, thanks, Murlock) or if any reader who has played it can give me some advice.I know this is a short, lame posting, so I promise one for Wizardry IV in a couple hours.[Note from 2017: My adventures with Tera continued, more successfully, nearly 7 years later.

Because, after all, almost anyone who speaks French also speaks English (even if they won't admit it), while the same isn't true of Spanish.Well, here I am, getting my head full of Fran\u00e7ais again just a couple of months ahead of my next trip to South America. If I begin my speech, \"Se\u00f1oras y messieurs,\" I'll know to blame Tera: La Cit\u00e9 des Cr\u00e2nes (\"Tera: the City of Cranes\").A far and wide search fails to turn up a manual for this game, but it features a fairly extensive opening introduction, with a number of screen shots that set up the game's plot. Not that it makes any sense. This is my best translation:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Not many games combine skyscrapers and sorcerers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amarande the Black [a planet],  once thriving, is now torn between three forces: technology, which incorporates all that was invented by scientists; transcendence, whose power relies on priests and vestal virgins; and magic, whose \"temple\" is buried in the depths of the City of Skulls.Technology tends to take refuge on a nearby small world--Alfol, an inhospitable desert. It is rumored that the priests are allies of Etres, inorganic telepaths of Meduz, and that the City of Skulls is populated with nameless horrors--the guardians of treasures! The most formidable of them are Arioch and his peers, names one avoids uttering.[Something about me being an exception to something] so that harmony reigns again on Amarande and the chaos is banished forever.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well! Now that that's clear, let's get into character creation. It looks like we name our character and assign points to various skills of the standard sort: strength, intelligence, agility, and so on, only in French.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 When done, I have my character and a bunch of heads at the bottom of the screen that I don't understand.The game starts you out in the middle of a first-person wilderness full of interesting plants and rocks.The interface is all keyboard, of course, with a wide variety of commands and sub-commands.It looks like the opening wilderness is about wandering around and collecting clues from various buildings and signposts. For instance, this guy at an abbey is telling me that the City of Skulls is under something called the SUN RAA.I've also gotten some clues that I need to go to a place called Kronopolis to buy things. But the language and/or lack of a manual keeps tripping me up. I wandered into one building described as the \"Temple of Seth\" where I met a woman. I tried using what looked to me to be a \"seduce\" command on her, and before I knew it she was thanking me for giving her 250 ducats--half my wealth!Do I get anything for that?[Later Edit: It turns out that for my 250 ducats, the woman, Sonja, joined my party.]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When I asked a few months ago what you've learned from CRPGs, reader Rizla Croix noted that they taught him English. This was a pretty good answer to my snarky question. I guess the question now is whether I want to invest enough time in Tera to bolster my French. Right now, without any kind of manual or clue, and having to stop and translate every screen, my prospects of long-term involvement in Tera are looking a little bleak. Have any of my readers played this game and made sense of it?"}, {"title": "The Greatest City in the World", "date": "Wednesday, October 6, 2010", "text": "Do you know what it means...Think about what makes a city a \"great city.\" (Bear with me, the connection to CRPGs comes at the end.) What are the elements you look for? You may come up with a slightly different list than mine, but I'll bet we share some of the same elements:A strong music sceneA good local cuisineNightlife and entertainmentAt least a few great places where you can sit and have a relaxing drink in the eveningA variety of bars, from quiet adult ones to raucous clubsInteresting architectureWalkabilityFriendly, interesting people\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Now, give each city you know a score of 1-10 for each of these items (yes, I'm really into indexes), add 'em up, and what comes out on top?My theory is that if you don't answer \"New Orleans,\" you either didn't take the exercise seriously or you've never been there.Maison Bourbon on an average night of the week. This isn't anywhere near the best club in town, and yet it beats just about any club in any other city.Let's start with the obvious: the best music the world has ever known. This is not a hyperbole. I firmly believe that New Orleans-style jazz beats any musical form ever created anywhere else, and this is coming from a man who cries to Beethoven's string quartets. The great thing about having this belief is that you can stroll down any one of several streets in New Orleans on any night of the week and wander into a club, sit down, and just absorb yourself in it without fanfare. Show me any other city where you have this many choices without having to go through the trouble of reservations and tickets and cover charges and reserved seats. I might pop into Preservation Hall for a set (yeah, all right; they have a cover charge), then wander up to Maison Bourbon for a drink with Jamil Sharif, check my iPhone to see if Banu Gibson is singing anywhere, and jump into a cab across town to spend the rest of the night with Kermit Ruffins--all for less than a single ticket to see much lesser performers in another city.(As an aside, between \"Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?,\" \"Basin Street Blues,\" and \"Bourbon Street Parade,\" New Orleans also has better songs about it than any other city.)Then, how about the food? If you've never had a muffuletta, I don't even know what to say to you. You've experienced life on a lower level than I have. Get to New Orleans, hie yourself to the Central Grocery, wait in line, and eat one. Then send me a thank-you card. When you get sick of those--and you won't get sick of those--you still have po' boys, all manner of Cajun and Creoloe cuisine, barbecue, and the best French and Italian food found anywhere outside France and Italy. Oh, God, and then there's the breakfasts--which most places happily serve until 4:00 p.m. (Enough with the beignets, though. Seriously: they're fried dough. I can get that at any county fair.)A muffuletta and a gimlet. Goddamn it, why did I leave?Nightlife...didn't I already cover that? And if jazz isn't your thing (and, frankly, if it isn't, you just haven't listened to the right jazz), you have any number of other options, from dance clubs to adult entertainment to gambling, all within about a three-block radius. Bars? Everything from class to crass. Architecture? I'd pit the Vieux Carre or the Garden District against the capitals of Europe. Walkability? New Orleans is made for walking.How about the people? Let's put it this way: to be a true \"Parisian,\" you need to be born in Paris to parents who were born in Paris. To be a true \"Bostonian,\" you have to live for at least 25 years in one of three neighborhoods that you would never live in if you weren't born there. To be a \"from New Orleans\" involves exactly one step: move to New Orleans. Or just visit for a long time. Some cities say they \"value diversity\"; New Orleans doesn't even have to think about it.All of this applies to New Orleans any day of the year. During the Jazz & Heritage Festival...oh, Jesus, don't get me started.I have been to every major city in America and most of the capitals of Europe, and there is simply none--none--that comes close to New Orleans at the top of my index. Granted, I haven't visited all of them, but what are the odds that Reykjavik or Riga are going to knock it off its pedestal?Okay, so bringing all of this back to CRPGs...yeah, I was just messing with you there. I just don't have another blog to write this sort of thing on. But if you've been jonesin' for my updates, stay tuned because I've started dithering with Tera and I should have enough gameplay in to resume blogging about CRPGs by Friday or Saturday.

Knowing that I was going to be on the road for the latter part of the week, I spent most of last Sunday playing Swords of Glass and writing four postings (including my final Starflight reckoning), scheduling them for automatic posting each night, Monday-Thursday.Then, in a series of great comments, readers noted some errors in my first and second Swords of Glass notes. But because I wasn't technically \"around,\" my subsequent postings got published with no acknowledgment, as if I was just ignoring everyone.The unseen-by-me \"utilities\" menu.For the record, it turns out there was an entire sub-menu to Swords of Glass that I missed. Commands on this menu allow you to:1. Wait out the effects of paralysis and sleep--I guess. Since readers told me this, I wandered around a bit trying to get paralyzed or slept again, but, wouldn't you know it, there were suddenly no traps. In my belief that paralysis and sleep were akin to permanent death, I was relying on some info from the fan pages I mentioned, but perhaps I misunderstood them.2. Force a second party member to follow the main character, thus allowing you to bring a healer into the dungeon without having to control the second character on the keyboard. (But you have to split experience with that person so you level up more slowly.)3. Death is not permanent. When your character dies, a grave stone appears in the dungeon. Another character can buy a resurrection potion and bring it to the dead character. Functionally, this is very difficult because resurrection potions cost a lot of money and you have to survive in the dungeon long enough to reach the dead character. Just like in Wizardry, by the time your new character is advanced enough to do this, you might as well just keep playing with him. I suppose there are ways around this by leaving new characters expensive goods in the vault, though.The second option is pretty advanced for the era, but then so is cooperative multiplayer.At this point, though, I've already viewed spoilers for the game, and I think I've played my fill of Swords of Glass even if it's a little easier than I thought.Unfortunately, my attempts to get ahead of the game will not save me for the rest of this month. Hence, the bad news: I will not be posting again until after October 4. I will be on the road for most of this period, and the time that I'm not on the road I'll be satisfying other professional obligations that Starflight had me neglecting.

I can still feel the thrill of excitement when, after two months of painstaking effort, we finally surmounted the last obstacle and captured the Sword of Glass.I applaud this kind of nostalgia. This is really what CRPGs should be about. If I had a son--or,  indeed, anyone in this household who even remotely enjoyed playing computer games--yeah, I'm looking at you, Irene--I think we could have a ball with Swords of Glass. She could map while I explore. She could play a wizard to my fighter. She could ensure that no game playing had to stop due to desperate need for a vodka gimlet. Oh, and she could wake up my f%&*#$ character when a trap puts him to sleep! I'll bet your son did that for you, didn't he, Wayne? Otherwise, I don't see how you could have won the game in only two months. [Later edit: turned out I was wrong about the permanency of sleep and paralysis. See this posting. Sorry, Wayne; sorry, everyone.]I had mapped most of Level 2 when this happened and had my fighter character--who could suddenly cast spells after finding a spellbook (another nice innovation, allowing me to heal myself without returning to the town)--up to level 11. Frankly, I was already annoyed with the game when I tripped over a rock and somehow dropped my sword forever; plus, I had to abandon a bunch of my other hard-earned equipment when I fell into quicksand (in a dungeon, keep in mind.) On the plus side, there was a neat mapping puzzle having to do with appearing and disappearing walls, and the game provided the first battles with rhinoceroses and \"land sharks\" that I've ever experienced in a CRPG.Reading through Wayne's walkthrough, it looks like by ending my game early, I missed out on:Some Wizardry-style dungeon features like spinners and pits with poisoned spikes.A large variety of brain teasers.A randomly-generated dungeon on Level 8 that changes every time you enter. (I am again impressed.)A menagerie of creatures that include jelly fish and squids, giant ants and mosquitoes and spiders, killer rabbits, giant amoebas, jack-o-lanterns, walking trees, storm clouds, friggin' giraffes, pterodactyls...Jesus Christ...kangaroos, \"teste\" flies (not a good spelling error there), elephants, tyrannosaurus, \"furballs with teeth,\"  (I'm not making this up but Wayne might be) \"raunchy giraffes,\" and of course demons.You can't fault the creators of Swords of Glass for unoriginality. Images courtesy of Wayne Schmidt.I know I've been praising Swords of Glass for its scrappy innovations, but honestly, traps that effectively kill your character immediately with no chance of escape or save are a bit of a dealbreaker. So let's review and then get on to Tera: La Cit\u00e9 des Cr\u00e2nes or Wizardry IV depending on how taxing on my memories of high school French the former turns out to be.1. Game world. None to speak of. It's possible the game came with a manual that told the back story, such as why you're seeking the Sword of Glass (or, you know, what it is), but neither of the two fan pages I've mentioned say anything about it, so I'm assuming it's just you and a dungeon. Score: 1.2. Character creation and development. Character creation is about selecting a name, assigning some points to four statistics, and choosing between warrior and magician classes. Pretty basic. But leveling up is strangely satisfying, allowing you to channel more points into your attributes. Your character notably improves with each level. Nonetheless, there is no \"role-playing\" with characters; the game is basically a three-dimensional roguelike. Score: 3.3. NPC Interaction. There are no NPCs that I could find, and the walkthrough didn't seem to give any indication that there are any at all. Score: 0.4. Encounters & foes. There a quite a strange selection of creatures in Swords of Glass, but they are not described except by name. Many share the same image. There is no AI to speak of, and nothing to do in encounters except whack away. Score: 2.5. Magic & combat. I love the magic system in which all of the spells are simply in Spanish. Other than that, it's a clone of Wizardry. Combat doesn't give you many options, but the ability to shoot arrows in multiple directions is innovative. Plus, the totality of combat in Swords of Glass is quite tactical, as you must carefully monitor your hit points and spell levels lest you get trapped too far from the surface. Score: 4.6. Equipment. There's a decent variety: several types of main weapons and bows, five different pieces of armor you can wear (armor, helms, shields, greaves, and gauntlets), plus various potions and magic items (I really liked the magic map). The ability to increase their power through blessings is unusual to a CRPG. Score: 5.7. Economy. You'd think with chests that respawn every time you re-enter the dungeon, it would be easy to get rich quick. I didn't find it easy. Healing, equipment, and blessings all cost enough money that you always need more. Score: 5.8. Quests. You have but one quest, to find the Sword of Glass, and I gather its ending isn't particularly celebratory. No side quests. Score: 1.9. Graphics, sound, inputs. Lousy, of course--you've seen the graphics, and I think there is only one sound in the game--but it's not like it pretends otherwise. Score: 1.10. Gameplay. If it wasn't for that damned permanent paralysis and sleep [Later edit: wrong about this; see here], I'd rate the game pretty high. Although it's \"linear\" in the sense of being a single-dungeon, multi-level game, it doesn't restrict where you can go in the dungeon. It seemed to have a good balance in terms of monsters, you level at a good clip, and the cooperative multiplayer is quite impressive. It's not replayable except to the extent that any roguelike is replayable. Score: 5.Final score: 27. That puts it on par with Rings of Zilfin and some of the roguelikes for enjoyability. It's worth a rainy afternoon but not a week.Swords of Glass has a kind-of blue-collar charm, a certain nobility about its poverty. I'd still love to know who created it, but since Dean Tersigni's Glass Shrine has been entreating the author to write to him for eight years with no luck, I don't suppose we have much of a chance of solving the mystery here."}, {"title": "Swords of Glass: Large, Full Dungeon", "date": "Wednesday, September 15, 2010", "text": "This is the most difficult monster on Level 1. You can't hit him!The more I play Swords of Glass, the more I see it as the little CRPG that could. I spent this evening mapping the first level of the dungeon, which at 25 x 25 is the largest of the square-area games I've played so far (Might & Magic was 15 x 15, Wizardry was 20 x 20, and The Bard's Tale was 22 x 22). The dungeon is chock full of monsters, treasure, and interesting encounters.And death. I cycled through six first-level characters before I finally survived long enough to raise a few levels and thus stay alive. At each level increase, you get another pool of points that you can put into health, strength, dexterity, or intelligence. My current character has risen five times, so he's getting pretty strong. He could still die at any minute, though--see below.At five locations on the first level, you come upon pairs of doors side-by-side with a sign in front of them posing a riddle. You have to choose which door to enter. If you choose the right one, you get a nice piece of treasure; the wrong one, you find yourself roasting alive in an inferno. Here are a couple of the riddles:So one of the signs is true and the other is false. If the first sign is false (e.g., both rooms have treasure or both have fire), then the second can't be true, so the first sign must be true, which means it has the treasure. Now try this one:It's been a while since I had to solve a cryptogram. Well, HIO is almost certainly THE. That means HIOQO is either THERE, THESE, or THEME. \"Theme\" seems unlikely, and if it's \"these,\" that means that another word, HQAO, begins with a TS. I'm going with THERE. That means for the long word in the first and second sentences, I have TRE---RE, which can't be anything but TREASURE. And so on. The solved cryptogram reads:THE LEFT SIGN IS TRUE IF AND ONLY IF THERE IS FIRE IN THE ROOM. THE RIGHT SIGN IS TRUE IF AND ONLY IF THERE IS TREASURE IN THE ROOM.Left side: AT LEAST ONE ROOM HAS TREASURERight side: AT LEAST ONE ROOM HAS FIREIt took me a while, but I got it, and a Bow +1 for my troubles. Guessing means instant death, so you have to be careful.Other different encounters include several statues that clue you to the location of treasure and stairs, a teleporter, \"dark\" squares that you have to carefully navigate, gargoyles on the wall that attack you and you can't fight back, and a pit of quicksand in which you have to abandon some of your equipment to escape.Alas, proper spelling does not.(Note: making fun of someone else's spelling or grammar virtually guarantees that you will have a major embarrassing mistake in your own posting. I look forward to the first person who tells me what mine is.)The monsters are difficult but not impossible, with the exception of a \"wispy shape\" that takes only one damage per hit, and you only hit him one out of every dozen times you try. The creatures re-spawn constantly, though, and attack you from all angles, so you have to keep turning around and making sure you're not being followed. If you espy a monster from a distance, you can try shooting it with your bow, which allows you to direct shots to the right and left, as well as straight ahead, depending on where your foe is coming from. Not even Might and Magic V, which won't come out for eight years, allows anything but straight-ahead archery.One of many nice little touches in Swords of Glass.You are helped in your explorations by potions and other treasure, including an enchanted map that gives you a little mini-plot of the area. Monsters don't drop treasure, but chests are plentiful and the dungeon resets when you leave, so you can keep picking up treasure from the same chests. This sounds like it's too easy, but wait a second and I'll tell you something.All of these interesting and innovative features are balanced by a couple of frankly unforgivable design flaws having to do with traps. First, you encounter traps in the corridors with no option to search for or disarm them ahead of time. Whether you trigger the trap or not depends on your dexterity, but even if you trigger it, it remains active and waiting to snare you when you pass that way again.Even worse, opening chests has a chance of triggering poison, paralyze, or sleep traps. Poison is annoying as usual, but you can treat it with a healing potion or a trip back to the surface. Paralysis and sleep, however, never wear off. They are the equivalent of instant death. If you trip one of these traps, you have to kill DOSBox, reload, and create a new character. [Later note: as several readers pointed out, I'm wrong about this.] If you were playing a multi-player game, your second character could heal the first, I guess, but to have such unavoidable traps in a single-player, permanent-death game is just absurd.Kojak will be stuck here forever. Maybe that's where all the statues came from.I never did find a manual for the game, so the only way I know anything about the main quest is from Dean Tersigni's \"The Glass Shrine\"  page, which gives a brief summary. Apparently the ultimate goal is to  get down to the eighth level and find...see if you can guess it...the  Sword of Glass. Why you'd want to  find this particular weapon--a weapon that sounds like it would be good  for exactly one hit--I'm not sure. There's no back story about a tyrant  or usurper or anything. Anyway,  one of the dangers of getting your  \"manual\" from a fan page is spoilers, and Dean's has a big one: when you  finally get the Sword of Glass, the game gives you a simple \"You Win!\"  and that's it. I wish I hadn't seen that, but now that I have, I have no  problem simply envisioning such text appearing on my screen the next time my character gets paralyzed or put to sleep.In the meantime, I'll start mapping Level 2 and see how it goes.The massive Level 1."}, {"title": "Game 25: Swords of Glass (1986)", "date": "Tuesday, September 14, 2010", "text": "I'm not a weaponsmith or anything, but I wouldn't rush the patent application on these.Swords of Glass is so cute you almost want to pat it on the head. While the age of CGA graphics is in full-swing, and gamers are enjoying titles with the narrative complexity and open-ended exploration of Ultima IV, Might & Magic, and Starflight, here comes a text-based game in which you guide one character through a single wire-frame dungeon.\"Turn THIS lead into gold!\" would be a great caption if I was using a gun.The game doesn't appear on Wikipedia's chronology; it's only thanks to MobyGames that I found out about it at all. MobyGames lists it as \"shovelware\": a piece of software that wasn't offered individually but packaged with dozens of other titles and sold under the banner \"100 FANTASTIC RPG ADVENTURES!\" or something. The publisher was a now-defunct Minnesota company called \"Keypunch Software,\" which apparently stripped the credits from the game, so no one now knows who created it.Character creation is a text-based process of naming your character (you have up to 7 letters) and then rolling random values for hits, strength, dexterity, and IQ, and then supplementing them from a pool of six points. You need at least 9 strength to become a warrior and at least 9 IQ to become a wizard. Those are the only character class choices.You have to love \"possible kinds to be\" instead of something more formal, like \"potential character classes.\"It's then a quick trip to the store for some basic equipment.Note the first option. Hey, grind some of that up and throw it into a goblin's eyes and it stings, man!In addition to the (s)tore, the town boasts a (h)otel and a (t)emple.A town that literally leaves everything to the imagination.When you choose to (b)egin your dungeon explorations, the game taunts you to \"ENTER IF YOU DARE!\" and then notes goofily, as you move away from the dungeon stairs, that \"well, Toto, this doesn't look like Kansas anymore...\" After that, it's all about exploring, mapping, killing monsters (so far, I've met \"bruisers,\" alchemists, and rodents), finding treasure chests, and dealing with traps, and, you guessed it:Every damned game has to have poison. Most spell it right.So, right now you're thinking to yourself, \"Ha! Sounds pretty lame! I bet this is a one-post game for The CRPG Addict!\" (And yes, \"The CRPG Addict\" has a capital \"The.\") Well, sit back and hold on, kids, 'cause I'm about to pull the rug out from under you. Notice how much space is wasted--like half the screen--in the image above? Well, let's rectify that by heading back up to the town and adding a second person to my \"party.\" Back to the dungeon we go and . . .. . . what do we have here? Two sets of commands, two maps, and characters who appear to be looking at each other? That's right, you smug bastards, you're looking at cooperative multiplayer. Let me say that again: cooperative multiplayer--in a piece-of-junk, written-by-a-high-school-kid-in-his-basement, shovelware CRPG. As far as I know, this is the first multiplayer in a graphics-based CRPG (I'm sure I'm wrong; I just don't know of any others), and we don't see it again until...what?...Federation II?As exciting as that is, I can't really make use of it because The CRPG Addict is a lone ranger, and not ambidextrous. But Swords of Glass has a few other surprises. Let's start with the spells, if you happen to choose a magician. As in Wizardry, you get a set number of spells per level, and as in Wizardry, which featured spells like HALITO and KATINO, the spells in Swords of Glass have strange, otherworldly names (bottom of the screen):I'm looking forward to level 3, when I get \"tumadre.\"That's right: my four years of high-school Spanish has finally proven some value. For those uneducated, \"pocofuego\" means \"little fire,\" and \"mapa\" means \"map.\" Other spells in the game include \"helio\" (ice), \"melaza\" (molasses; it's a paralyze spell), and \"infierno\" (inferno). Brillante! Estoy muy impresionado!What else? Remember that chalk I was making fun of? Well, it turns out it has a pretty useful purpose: you can mark marks on dungeon walls so you can track where you've been. In a game that features teleporters, this could be awfully useful. Quick, give me the name of any other CRPG in which you can make a mark without dropping some inventory on the ground. I can't think of one.Graffiti!You know how I'm always bitching about CRPGs that give you piles of money with nothing to spend it on? Well, not this game. In Swords of Glass, you can take any weapon or armor you want into the temple and ask the priest for a blessing. They get progressively more expensive as you add more +s to your equipment. I'm guessing you never run out of the need for cash.It's these touches and others--like the little automap on the screen, or a \"vault\" where you can store good equipment for later characters--that explain why this otherwise-throwback game has a small but devoted online following, with sites like The Glass Shrine and Wayne Schmidt's Swords of Glass page. I owe both of these pages for helping me to figure out some basic game information, since I couldn't find a manual anywhere.So I'm going to give this game it's full due. I can't say for sure that I'll play it until I win, because unfortunately it's a permanent-death game, and I suspect my patience will run out after the sixth time I lose a level 5 character to a wight.

Aside from the title of my blog, I'm not sure how much I care. Starflight was a delightful surprise of a game--just the sort of game I started this project to find--and I had a lot of fun. Let's see if I come up with a score that reflects that.This should be old news by now, but I'm using the GIMLET scale I outlined five months ago.1. Game World. Absolutely top-notch. You have an entire galaxy to explore with a fascinating backstory that is sketched out in the manual but only fully revealed as you explore, find artifacts and messages, and talk to various races. The lore is unique and interesting, the final twist is amazing, and some mysteries persist even after you've won. Unlike almost every other game of the era, your actions measurably affect the game world and your relationships with the various alien races. I can't think of many games that do it better. Final score: 9.This was a definite Sixth Sense moment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. Character Creation and Development. It's the lack of both that make me hesitate on the \"CRPG\" angle. Yes, you have up to six \"characters,\" and yes, you can choose their names and races and incrementally train them. The problem is, once you load them into your ship, your characters cease to really exist as separate characters. They're just part of your ship, occupying its various roles. No one talks to them or refers to them individually. Although you can train them in various skills, you only really need to train them in the one skill that goes with their function, and you can maximize this fairly quickly. Except for the fact that you can't have Elowan and Thrynn in the same crew, and those races react to you depending on who you have, your choice of races affects nothing about the game. Final score: 2.Going with a Star Trek theme just seemed way too obvious.3. NPC Interaction. Reasonably excellent. You must establish meaningful communications with the various alien races to understand the game world, figure out the main quest, and learn the locations of planets and artifacts. The game gives you several \"attitude\" options when speaking to the aliens--hostile, friendly, and obsequious (there's a word you don't often encounter)--and you have to carefully figure out what works best with which races. The aliens only speak to you for a limited time, so you have to choose your questions carefully. Although you don't really have \"dialog options\" in the manner of the Bioware/Black Isle games of the next decade, the dialog in Starflight is more advanced than anything else in this era except Ultima IV. Final score: 8.4. Encounters and Foes. The \"monsters\" in Starflight are unique to this game, fully described, and very interesting, with their own personalities and attitudes. They behave completely differently depending on who they are and what you've done to them. Oddly for a CRPG, you can get entirely through Starflight without fighting a single battle, so concepts of \"respawning\" don't apply. Final score: 8.Hmmm...maybe I should destroy their home planet, just for kicks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5. Magic and Combat. This being a science fiction CRPG, there's no \"magic\" in the game, but there is some combat. I suppose you could fight extensively if you wanted to. Destroying enemy ships allows you to loot them for their minerals and fuel, and you have several races that are more than happy to fight you. But the mechanics of combat are extremely weak. Once you raise your shields and arm your weapons, you just point and shoot, and the interface to do so is clunky and nonresponsive. The weakest part of the game. Final score: 1.It's like sort-of point and sort-of shoot.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 6. Equipment. There are two types of \"equipment\" in this game: ship upgrades and artifacts. At the beginning stages, it's very satisfying to progressively upgrade your ship with better weapons, armor, engines, and cargo capacity. Artifacts are strewn across the planets, but very few of them actually do anything. Those that are helpful are always found in fixed locations, never randomized, which doesn't reward open exploration. You have to take the artifacts back to Starport to \"analyze\" them, which is always satisfyingly cryptic: you get some idea what the artifact is supposed to do, but you don't fully find out until you employ it in the field. My biggest complaint: the best artifacts are found close to the end of the game when you no longer need them. Final score: 5.A fully equipped star ship.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7. Economy. There are several ways to make money in Starflight: mining for minerals, collecting life specimens, destroying and salvaging enemy ships, and finding suitable planets for colonization. To me, mining was absurdly addictive, and even towards the end of the game I couldn't suppress feelings of delight whenever I stumbled upon a particularly rich vein of minerals. But you lose the need for money about halfway through the game, when your characters are fully trained and your ship fully equipped and your finding more Endurium than you know what to do with. When you win the game, you get 500,000 credits that serve no purpose. Final score: 6.8. Quests. The game has a compelling main quest with a great twist, but there is only one outcome, no opportunity for role-playing, and no side quests. Unusual for the era, the main quest is on a time limit (which turns out to be plenty of time). Final score: 5.9. Graphics, Sound, and Inputs. I had no complaints at all with the EGA graphics, but we're still in the \"painful era\" for sound, and I played the game with the sound turned off. The controls leave a little to be desired. You essentially have to use the number pad to scroll your way through the menus, which takes an annoyingly long time in combat (you're rushing to get from \"communications\" to \"navigation\" to put your shields up). It would have been very helpful to hotkey certain actions, as most of the keyboard is unused. Final score: 3.10. Gameplay. The gameplay is utterly open-ended, allowing you to explore the whole galaxy (to the limits of your fuel, anyway) right from the beginning. The pacing is good: I got addicted to it quickly and wouldn't had minded if it had lasted a few more hours, but it seemed to end at the right time. On the other hand, there's virtually no replayability except to mine new planets. [Later edit: reader Max points out that one replayability option is to choose Thrynn crewmembers and make friends with that race, getting different clues and reaching the endgame through a different route. Point taken, and final score increased.] On the question of difficulty, it's tough to evaluate. If you try to engage in combat, it's too hard, but other aspects are too easy. For instance, the manual makes a big deal about the horrible things that happen if you lose your Terrain Vehicle, run out of fuel and have to make a distress call, or recommend a bad planet for colonization, but really you'd have to be an idiot to do any of these things. Final score: 6.The CRPG Addict is no idiot.Final ranking:  53. This puts it with Ultima IV but not quite as high as Might & Magic I. I don't know how well this reflects the game. Perhaps I need to add an \"addictiveness\" handicap to my rankings, because there's just something ineffably compelling about Starflight. From the moment I started playing it, I played it for a few hours every night.In 83 more games, I'll be playing Starflight II.

Stop here if that's the case....Okay, so I blew up a planet and killed an entire race this evening.It started with the discovery of the Institute's old headquarters on Akteron-6, where in a long document related to \"Project Teleport,\" I learned about the Old Empire's plan to teleport an agent to the Crystal Planet --the veritable \"Death Star\" causing suns to flare and destroy all life in their systems--and have him destroy it with a bomb. The agent, Commander McConnell, made it to the planet and set off the explosive, but it didn't do anything. Ultimately, the Institute discovered they would need three devices:A crystal orb to nullify the planet's defenses. This is what the Veloxi referred to as their holy artifact, the \"small egg,\" and I had a clue from them about where it is.A crystal cone to identify the location of the control nexus of the Crystal Planet. The message gave me coordinates where I could find it, but noted that it was \"deep in Uhlek space.\"A bomb. I already had one, and then I found a second one after getting a clue from the Veloxi about a planet on the \"handle of the axe\" (a reference to an axe-shaped constellation). It was apparently left over from the destruction of the Phlegmak.I knew the planet that held the crystal orb but I didn't know the coordinates yet, so I set out to find the crystal cone first. But I kept getting attacked and killed by Uhlek. Finally, I'd had enough. Since I had two bombs, I could spare one. I flew to the Uhlek home planet (clue to its location received from the Spenim) and set off the bomb. As the Spenim had indicated, killing the Uhlek \"mind ganglion\" apparently took care of the entire fleet. No more Uhlek.I retrieved the crystal cone and then followed some clues I'd received from the Elowan to some other Old Empire bases, where I found references to two other artifacts: a \"tesseract,\" which turned out to halve my fuel usage (unnecessary at this point because I'd found a boatload), and a \"red cylinder,\" which turned out to perform an amazing service: when in orbit around a planet, it pinpoints the location of artifacts. This allowed me to retrieve the crystal orb from the Velox planet (fortunately, I didn't run into any Veloxi again after that) as well as a \"crystal pearl\" from a planet on which the Spenim told me was a \"city of the Ancients.\" All I found was the pearl and a bunch of Endurium laying about. (The pearl, by the way, teleports you away from battle if you're about to die. Handy, but it turns out I never engaged in battle again after this.)This is supposed to be a \"City of the Ancients.\" All I see is a ruin and a bunch of Endurium fuel...\u00a0 It seemed I had all the artifacts I needed to engage the Crystal Planet. I first returned to Starport to get new armor for my ship and see if there were any final notices. If I hadn't just found a huge cache of Endurium, this one would have been a little annoying:I smell corruption.I headed off for the Crystal Planet at the coordinates given to me by the Veloxi. It was where they said it was. With my crystal orb, I evaded their defenses, and the crystal cone pointed out the location of the control center.\u00a0 I found a ruin on the planet's surface with the remains and last log of Commander McConnell. It gives a hell of a twist ending. In it, he remarks on the lumps of Endurium found everywhere on the planet. He went ahead and set the charges and waited for them to blow. As he waited, he was contacted telepathically by the Ancients, who turned out to be...wait for it....the lumps of Endurium.That's right. The Ancients haven't left the galaxy; they're everywhere, and we're burning them for fuel! Their extremely slow metabolism means that they live \"in an entirely different time framework\" and don't even realize that carbon-based life forms are sentient. They saw us as a virus to destroy. While expressing remorse for this revelation, Commander McConnell noted that nonetheless he hoped the bomb succeeded. \"At this point, it's us or them.\"Agreeing with this sentiment, I guess, I dropped the bomb and skedaddled. The rest was predictable:\u00a0 Left unstated is whether humans are going to continue with hyperspace travel now that we know we're destroying sentient lifeforms to do it. Given what I've learned about Interstel in this posting, I'm guessing yes. Thus, I committed genocide twice in the same night.So...wow. I won. It seemed to come awfully quickly, and I feel like there's a ton about the game that I never explored. I never figured out what was going on with the Minstrels or Mysterions, nor did I ever come to a meaningful resolution with the Gazurtoids (I would have liked to destroy their home planet but I never found out where it was). Consulting a walkthrough (which I can do after I win), it doesn't appear that I missed anything, though, save a third bomb located on one of the Arth system planets.I created a YouTube account to try to record and post better videos, and below is the first one I uploaded, showing the process of winning Starflight. In the future, I'll record and narrate more videos during the process of playing each game.Final reckoning to follow.It loses something without the animation.Tonight, I discovered something delightful. If you're in Starport and you don't move for a while, your character begins tapping his foot impatiently. This is an ancestor of the funny comments (\"Booooring!\", \"I grow weary of standing still\") that your Baldur's Gate characters make when you abandon them for more than a few minutes. I have to start tracking all of these \"firsts\" in a spreadsheet or something.Finding New Scotland (which I was talking about at the end of my last post) was easy with some deduction. The clue was that the planet was the second one in the star system at the upper end of the \"Staff Constellation.\" There were several constellations that looked like they could have been in the shape of a staff, but I noted one was a fairly quick flux ride from Earth. I figured anything called \"New Scotland\" would be easily accessible from Earth. (Incidentally, LordKarnov42 also used the same logic and tried to help me out in a comment. I'm sorry I didn't read his comment until after I had found it, but I'm also glad I figured it out on my own.) I was right. Landing, I found a lot of Ancients ruins with fuel plus a clue to go to a specific location. There were a number of newspapers referencing \"Harrison,\" who appeared to be a space pirate based on New Scotland. I visited a couple of his bases and found a \"rod device\" and a clue as to another of his bases on a distant planet. There, I found a colonizable planet and an \"ellipsoid\" artifact that turned out to have been stolen from the Veloxi. Returning it made them my best friends.Tonight, this blog is going to help me get my notes together. I spent a while talking to the Spemin, the Veloxi, and the Elowans, and among them I learned so much that I'm having trouble keeping it all straight. Here is what I know, at this point, about the various races in Starflight.HumansHumans discovered Endurium (the mineral that allows faster-than-light travel) in 2100 and began using it to explore the galaxy and colonize planets. The Old Empire was formed, and contacts were made with the Velox (2300), Spemin (2675), and Thrynn and Elowan (2770). Between 3000 and 3400, there was a galactic war between the Old Empire and four other races that seemed to result in victory for the Old Empire, but on the cusp of this victory, some phenomenon caused numerous stars, including Earth's, to \"flare\" and destroy all life in their galaxies. A group of scientists called the Institute initiated Project Noah to save humanity by seeding the rest of the galaxy with colonies and ships. Only one of these, on Arth, seems to have survived. (At least one of the others was sabotaged by Laytonites.) Even Arth collapsed into dark ages for 900 years after an alien bomb went off on the planet. Humans on Arth rediscovered Endurium in 4594 and began exploring again. So far, I have encountered no other humans in the galaxy.Velox\u00a0 The Veloxi are a hive-based insect species ruled by a queen. They are described by others as \"isolationist and arrogant.\" They became allies of the Old Empire after a few misunderstandings and skirmishes. They claim that they helped the Old Empire when the \"first wave\" (Phlegmak and Numlox, who the Veloxi claim to have destroyed) attacked, but that the Old Empire refused to assist when the Veloxi alone were attacked. In response, the Veloxi refused to help against the \"second wave\" (Uhlek and Gazurtoid), dooming the Old Empire to destruction.Some Veloxi were living on Arth during the collapse, but presumably they have more in common with Arth humans than their cousins in the galaxy (I have two Veloxi in my crew). The Veloxi demand Endurium from me every time I encounter them.Their \"Prophecy of the Egg\" concerns the Crystal Planet that causes suns to flare. They think it will destroy all life in the galaxy except the Veloxi queen. It will then hatch, revealing an Ancient named Xpu, who will mate with the queen and create a new race.They were the ones that put the probe around the planet I wrote about yesterday. Apparently, my answers were supposed to have something to do with multiples of six (the Veloxi holy number). My destroying the probe doesn't seem to have bothered them. They became my close friends immediately after I returned to them an artifact that had been stolen from them by a human space pirate named Harrison.Elowan\u00a0 The Elowan are a plant species that speak like a cross between Einstein and Hamlet. They are scientists and healers. They and the Thrynn hate each other for reasons so far unrevealed. Like the Velox, there were Elowan living on Arth during the dark ages that have lost touch with other Elowan in the wider galaxy. I have two Elowan in my crew.From speaking to them, I learned that they are on their third homeworld, the first two having been destroyed by flares. They and the Thrynn are originally from the same system, and the Thrynn make war on them to find and consume their \"headfruit,\" which bestow intelligence on the Thrynn (this sounds a bit like a Farscape episode involving the Scarrans). The Elowan know that the Thrynn's sun is due to flare soon but don't intend to tell them.When the Old Empire first encountered the Elowan, humans didn't even know that Elowan were sentient because the Thrynn told them they weren't.The Elowan say that Arth's sun will flare in the final week of the tenth month of the year.Thrynn\u00a0 The Thrynn are a saurian species that specialize in statescraft and oratory. They look like small dinosaurs and dislike the Elowan for reasons I don't know, although the Thrynn and Elowan stuck on Arth seem to have found a way to get along. A Thrynn captained one of the earliest expeditions from Arth and ended up destroying an Elowan ship. He came across as a bit of a jerk in the manual, so I decided not to include a Thrynn crewmember.According to the Elowan, the Thrynn are a predatory and treacherous species who will soon be dead when their sun flares, although the Thrynn don't know this.Either because I have Elowan in my crew or because I spoke to the Elowan first, or both, the Thrynn won't even talk to me. They attack when they see me.Spemin\u00a0 The Spemin are a bunch of blowhard slugs who worship a \"blob goddess.\" During the Old Empire's war, they constantly switched sides to their own advantage. When I first encountered them, they claimed to be a superior species that could destroy me easily and demanded that I worship them. When I accidentally happened upon their home planet, they swarmed and attacked me, but after I destroyed one of their ships, they immediately capitulated and started kowtowing to me. In one encounter (I forgot to take a screenshot), a Spemin captain said something like, \"WE SURRENDER! DON'T HURT US! HERE IS THE SECRET LOCATION OF OUR HOME PLANET: 82, 148. GO THERE AND DESTROY OTHER SPEMIN BUT SPARE US!\" It was a riot. They also claim to have avoided destruction by the Gazurtoid by sitting in pools of water every time they encounter them.GazurtoidThe Gazurtoid are an octopus-looking aquatic species who believe it is their destiny to rid the galaxy of \"air-breathers.\" They fly around spouting biblical-sounding verse to that effect. They were one of the four races who attacked the Old Empire, although they don't seem to have been working in concert with the other evil races. By some accounts, they hate the Uhleks in particular. The Gazurtoids fly in spaceships impervious to missiles.UhlekI haven't encountered the Uhlek yet, unless they are the species that keeps attacking my ships without even hailing me. The Spemin and Elowan claim that the Uhlek are actually a single creature (a \"mind-ganglion\" according to the Spemin) that lives deep in its planet and sends \"parts\" of itself into space. Sounds like a good place to drop my black egg bomb.NumloxThe Numlox were one of the races that attacked the Old Empire. I haven't even seen a description of them yet. The Mechans say there is an 84% chance they were completely destroyed in the war with the Old Empire, and the Veloxi claim they wiped them out.PhlegmakSame as the Numlox.Mechans\u00a0 Mechans technically aren't a race but are simply androids created by humans. The only group of them I've encountered were from the Old Empire and were guarding a colony world called \"Heaven.\" There are Mechans on Arth, too, and you can choose them as crewmembers although their utility is limited because they can't be trained.AncientsThe Ancients were a race that existed long before humans left Earth. Their ruins are found all over the galaxy, and they seem to be the first to have used Endurium for faster-than-light travel. Some races say they came from a distant galaxy and seeded this one with life, and that they will later return to judge the races. Others say that they created something called a \"Crystal Planet,\" to which I recently got coordinates. No one seems to know what kind of race they were.The Veloxi say that the Ancients were Veloxi, but the Elowans say that this is just \"conceitful folly.\"Minstrels\u00a0 The Minstrels are a strange race floating about the galaxy singing, according to the Elowan, a \"song about what was.\" I haven't been able to decipher their cryptic riddles. Also according to the Elowan, what we see of the Minstrels is the Minstrels themselves, not their ships--they apparently do not require any ships. They are also known as Delasa'Alia.Mysterions or Unknown Morse Code Species\u00a0 This is the species that transmitted what turned out to be Morse code for the telephone number (now disconnected) of the game developers. Technically, I suppose they could be Uhlek, Numlox, Phlegmax, or Ancients, because I don't know what any of those races look like, but I'm guessing they are \"Mysterions.\" This latter term appears on the Starflight codewheel with all the other races, but I otherwise haven't encountered them.Now, on the main quest and next steps. The Elowan claim that the Ancients created the \"Crystal Planet\" whose function is to \"destroy all life,\" so I'm guessing this is what's causing the stars to flare. I have coordinates for the Crystal Planet from the Veloxi. I can't just head over there and drop my egg bomb because, according to the Elowan, it \"unleashes a mighty force\" that I need a \"certain device,\" known to the Institute but not to anyone else, to protect me against it. I also need some \"cone of crystal\" to enter the \"nexus of control\" on the planet.Fortunately, I have a lot of other places to explore based on my conversations with these races:The location of the Uhlek homeworld, which I might be able to bombThe location of the Elowan homeworldThe location of the Thrynn homeworldVarious clues that point me to the location of Akteron-6, where the Institute had a baseA fabled City of the Ancients in a nebula near Spemin space (I actually found this planet, I think, but without specific coordinates I couldn't find any city, just ruins and lots of Endurium, and an artifact called a \"red herring\" which, predictably, wouldn't fit into my Terrain Vehicle)More Old Empire ruins on an ice planetAnother set of Old Empire ruins in a yellow planet systemThe planet Sphexi where the Veloxi claim is a \"magnificent hexagon\" (a hive?) in which another egg bomb is storedThis game sure doesn't get boring. I feel like I'm on the right path, which is a good thing, because according to the Elowan, I only have five months to save Arth."}, {"title": "Starflight: Closer to the Main Quest", "date": "Saturday, September 11, 2010", "text": "Wikipedia lists 23 people with the surname Layton.  I'd like to think he was named after Turner Layton (1894-1978) who wrote the sublime jazz standards \"After You've Gone\" and \"If I Could Be with  You.\" The lesson is: don't assume that just because someone only says a limited number of things on your first encounter, that's all they have to say.Tonight, after screwing around the galaxy and wasting fuel for a couple of hours, I managed to run into the same \"Noah 9\" Mechans from the previous night. I spoke to them again, and they gave me all kinds of information that they didn't give me the first time. In fact, I had to speak to them four times before I finally seemed to have milked them for all their data. For all their promises that their databanks were open to me, they were awfully quick to terminate our conversations.It would take a lot of space to write down everything I learned in subsequent visits, but these are the highlights:The Gazurtoid--the bible-thumping, \"many-tentacled aquatic creatures\" I already encountered--live in \"tremendous colony ships.\" They are enemies of the Uhlex (whom I have not encountered, I don't think), and both of them were enemies of the Old Empire (Earth). The Uhlex have particularly powerful weapons.The Mechans believe the Old Empire's other enemies, the Numlox and the Phlegmak, were destroyed during the war. The Phlegmak had powerful bombs shaped like black eggs that destroyed many of the Old Empire's planets. (Anything to do with the Veloxi's \"prophecy of the Egg?\")The Old Empire allied with a particularly cowardly race called the Spemin. When the Old Empire first encountered them, they were in a pre-technological state, but the Old Empire helped boost their level. A fascist-sounding movement called the Secret Society for Spemin Superiority (SSSS) gained power and attacked the Old Empire with its own technology. When the Numlox and Phlegmak attacked, the Spemin begged the Old Empire for protection, which was granted, but they turned on the Empire again after the war was over. I'm guessing the Spemin are the egotistical slimes I wrote about at the end of my last posting.All those places on planets where I've been finding Endurium are ruins of the Ancients, not the Old Empire. Ancients ruins are usually found in Class M star systems.The Velox (the insectoids) were the first race the Old Empire encountered, and the Old Empire took much of technology from them. They are arrogant and isolationist.The Laytonites were a faction of the Old Empire, apparently led by someone named Layton, that believed the Empire was evil and should die. They were the ones that sabotaged Project Noah.The first Project Noah mission failed because a failure in a \"ring device\" made it impossible for the navigators to identify \"continuum fluxes.\" I think continuum fluxes are the little wormholes that send you flying across the galaxy, saving time and fuel. I don't seem to have any problem finding them despite not having a \"ring device.\"An Earth organization called the Institute--the ones also responsible for Project Noah--studied the Ancients. Two common beliefs were that the Ancients had originally seeded the universe with life and that they would one day return to judge mankind. The Ancients may have built a device called the \"Crystal Planet.\" Don't know what that is yet. There might be some Ancients still living in Spemin space.There is a \"Dead Zone,\" identified by the Institute, of flared stars progressing from the \"coreward\" (right) side of the galaxy towards the center. I have verified this through my explorations, noting that all the stars to the right of a certain point say \"post-flare,\" those in the middle are about to flare, those slightly more to the left are \"unstable,\" and the ones on the far left are fine. This would suggest that Arth has a limited time to live until I can figure out the cause. Notes in the Operations Room at Starport confirm this. I suspect this, then, is the main quest, and since the destruction of stars is progressing, it would seem I have a limited time to complete it.My Mechan conversations gave me a ton of clues for exploration. Some of them were specific coordinates and planets (including direct coordinates for a station on Earth) and some were hints, like a fabled city of the ancients somewhere in a nebula near Spemin space.One of the clues led me to a nearby star in which there were supposed to be some ruins on one of the planets. As I approached, I was challenged by a probe that shot a series of numbers at me and asked me to answer \"yes\" or \"no.\" I tried to discern a pattern in the numbers, but I only got through three before I apparently answered wrong and the probe attacked me.Does it have something to do with Rolling Rock?I destroyed it fairly easily, landed on the planet, visited the coordinates, and damned if I didn't find a \"black egg\" artifact. Does this mean I now have the ability to destroy a planet? If so, I need to find where the evangelical octopuses call home.The Earth coordinates looked to be in the Arizona area. (Incidentally, the coordinates I was given, 12N, 104W, doesn't correspond with actual latitude and longitude on Earth, which would be in the Pacific Ocean off Mexico.) Landing, I found a ruin where messages told me of the last days of Earth before the solar flare and the location of another base in a nearby system. There was also an artifact called a \"hypercube.\"150 degrees...Arizona...sounds about normal.On Mars (which mysteriously has water), at the \"Center of the North Pole\" (which only makes sense if navigation is based on a Mercator map), I found the Institute's \"Starflight Navigational Research Station\" and a \"ring device\" artifact. If my conversation with the Mechans is to be believed, this should help me find fluxes. I'm curious what it will do that I'm not already doing.I knew one of the two nearby stars was Mardan because I had clues about Mardan-2 and Mardan-4. One of the systems only had three planets, so by process of elimination I visited the other. On Mardan-2, I got just a bunch of cryptic messages about a lack of resources. On Mardan-4, I found (as was promised by the Mechans), a mining bonanza, including lots of Ancients ruins with fuel. I filled my hold and returned to Starport.Most of the artifacts I found were worthless as usual. The ring device, the analysts confirmed, would help me find fluxes. The analysis of the hypercube seems to be screwing with me: is it a Rubik's Cube? If so, it's worth 15,000 MUs. I think I'll keep it just in case it does something important.Definition of \"easy victory\": giving a Rubik's cube to a color-blind person.Back out into space. \"The richest and strongest planet of the Old Empire,\" the Mechans told me, \"was New Scotland, the second planet in the upspin end of the Staff Constellation.\" One theory is that I have to find a clue as to where the \"Staff Constellation\" is somewhere else. But I noted that Earth was described as being in the \"Pythagoras Constellation\" which, true to its name, featured three stars in the shape of a right triangle. Does that mean I need to be looking for stars in the shape of a staff? If so, there are a lot of possibilities.I think I'll try heading into Spemin Space next and see if I can abuse some intelligence out of the treacherous bastards and perhaps find this fabled Ancient colony in the midst of a nebula. Does this game ever stop being fun?"}, {"title": "Starflight: Earth and Other Planets", "date": "Friday, September 10, 2010", "text": "Now this looks familiar...Going into this game, I had this idea that Earth would be the big reveal, like the final quest would involve finding it or something. I guess I had Battlestar Galactica on my mind. So imagine my surprise when it showed up on my viewscreen already.When I last blogged, I had received another set of coordinates to check out. Arriving there, I found three stars in very close proximity.I explored all three. Two of them were small systems, but when the third turned out to have nine planets orbiting a yellow sun (albeit a sun that had \"flared,\" destroying all life in the system), I began to get excited.Sure enough, the third planet brought me to the screen at the top of this posting. I tried to land somewhere in the New York/Washington DC area. I encountered a barren and blasted landscape with \"muddy brown oceans\"--a subtle environmental dig?I'm sure there must be ruins here to find, but I can't find them. Each planet is quite large, and unless you have a previous clue about where to land, there's simply too much territory to explore. I tried landing in the areas of Los Angeles, London, and Tokyo, too, but to no avail.Despondent, I returned to Spaceport hoping for a new message with a clue, but I didn't have any. Selling my minerals, I realized I had lots of money with nothing to spend it on. My ship, as you can see, is already maxed out with equipment, and my characters are already maxed out with training.So I decided to head out and explore random planets until something interesting came along.I only spoke briefly about planets before, so let me expand on that now. When you enter a solar system, you see a central star with several rings around it representing the orbits of planets. Somewhere within each orbit is a single planet. The stars are color-coded according to how hot they are, ranging from red (coolest) to dark blue (hottest). Since I'm color blind, I pretty much just have to guess.A solar system with five planets.If you fly over one of the planets, you have the option to enter the planet's orbit. At this point, you can have your science officer scan it. I'm guessing that the completeness of the scan depends on the skill level of the science officer, but since I elevated mine to his maximum skill very quickly, I've never had anything but a complete scan.In scanning a planet, you're trying to figure out several things:Can I safely land on this planet?Is it worth landing to search for minerals and/or life forms?Can I recommend this planet for colonization?The sensors alone tell you part of the story. This planet is an immediate non-candidate for colonization because it doesn't have any oxygen in the atmosphere and doesn't have any water in the hydrosphere. On the other hand, the lithosphere (the physical surface of the planet) has some valuable elements, and the sensors say that the mineral rating is 46. This is one of the higher figures I've seen. I don't know exactly what it represents, but on other planets anything higher than 25 or so has provided me all the minerals I can handle. There is, however, absolutely no life.The \"analysis\" of the sensors tells you even more. In this case, the gravity of the planet is only 2% of Earth gravity, meaning not only can I land safely, it will hardly cost me any fuel to leave. Such a low gravity would also rule out colonization, though, if the lack of oxygen and water didn't already. Also ruling out colonization would be the \"inferno\" temperature of the planet. But the \"calm\" global weather means I can probably explore for minerals without risking injury or death to my crew. This, in short, is a planet that I strip mine for minerals but not much else.As you explore a planet looking for minerals and ruins, your Terrain Vehicle uses a certain amount of fuel depending on the gravity, terrain, and weather. If all three are to your disadvantage, you might only be able to travel a few kilometers from your spaceship before you have to head back and refuel. If all three are on your side, you can venture dozens of kilometers away. The longer you can stay out, the more exploration you can accomplish, and the more minerals you can collect.Here, on the other hand, is a planet perfect for colonization. The previous screen told me that it had an oxygen/nitrogen atmosphere. Its gravity is exactly that of Earth, it has plenty of life and minerals, and the global weather is calm. The only strike against it is the temperature, which is a little hot, but not too hot. I can claim this planet in the name of Arth, log it, and get a hefty reward when I return to Spaceport. (If you accidentally recommend a bad planet, you get fined upon return to Spaceport, so you have to be careful.)This planet, I can't even safely land on. The gravity would crush my ship. Frankly, I don't know what the cutoff point is, but I've been avoiding planets with higher than 5.0 (5X that of Earth) gravity.While I was exploring to capture these images, I ran into an alien species I hadn't seen before. It looks like a blob with antennas coming out if it, and it's too clever for its own good.I've met the Gazurtoid. The Gazurtoid are old enemies of mine. You, sir, are no Gazurtoid.Unfortunately, on the \"friendly\" setting, these fools didn't tell me anything except how cool they are and how I should worship them. I was just about to figure out how they would respond to \"hostile\" when they abruptly cut communications and took off. I'm sure we'll meet again, mighty slugs.So I'm out of specific clues unless I want to head back to Earth and try to explore every inch of it. I guess I'll just bop around for a while and see if I can find any more aliens. I have plenty of money for fuel, after all. More tomorrow."}, {"title": "Starflight: Clues, Quests, and Combat", "date": "Thursday, September 9, 2010", "text": "Finally! Sweet, juicy data banks.The evening didn't start well. Literally every thing I did led to destruction, either at the hands of Mechans or Gazurtoids (more below), always after I'd spent an hour or so filling my hold with minerals.For some reason, I kept playing, and things got better. Tonight I \"solved\" what feel like two major quests.First, the Mechans. They hang around a planet about 20 sectors from the Spaceport, destroying any ship they contact. There was a notice about them in the operations room at Spaceport. Every time I met up with them, they would ask a series of questions, and I would get the answers \"wrong,\" apparently, and they would destroy me. Finally, after some trial and error and common sense, I answered their questions in a satisfactory manner (essentially convincing them that I was their long-lost master), and they gave me access to their databanks. From them, I learned:The Old Empire was attacked by a variety of races called the Numlox (seriously? Are we going to have a species called the \"Baxpase\"?), the Phlegnak, the Uhlek, and the Gazurtoid. The attacks started in 3400 and lasted more than 400 years.The Old Empire had an organization called the Institute, which was a society of scientists and intellectuals who believed the Empire was going to be destroyed.The Institute conceived Project Noah, filling at least nine \"ark\" ships and sending them to various worlds for underground colonization so they could outlast the destruction of the Empire and save the human race.These Mechans were sent in 3479 to secure and terraform the planet where a colony called Heaven would be located. They were supposed to be followed a year later by Noah 9, but they never came (because the mission was sabotaged by Laytonites, as I discovered yesterday; I still don't know who they are).While waiting for Noah 9, the Mechans followed their programming and defended the planet from other races. They were attacked 14 times, twice so badly they had to retreat underground and repair themselves.Having imparted this information, the Mechans allowed me access to Heaven, which was full of minerals. I loaded up greedily, logged the planet (renaming it \"Utopia\"), and returned to Spaceport for a nice reward.For my second expedition of the evening, I tracked the coordinates I received two nights ago of some aliens who had a stolen a cloaking device. These aliens turned out to be the Gazurtoids, who have some issue with \"air-breathers\"--and I'm talking a biblical issue.These evangelist aliens were defending the planet at the coordinates in question, but I finally bested one in battle, destroyed him, and looted my first ship.Boo-ya.On the planet--which I christened \"Gazurtoida\" and logged as colonizable--there was a king's ransom in minerals plus a \"shimmering orb\" which turned out to be the cloaking device. I haven't had a chance to use it in combat yet. I also visited a ruin where I received cryptic coordinates for yet another Old Empire ruin.This is what I call a planet!I think it's safe to say that this game is the best discovery of my CRPG project so far. I had never heard of it before a couple of weeks ago, and now I'm completely hooked. My only complaint is combat. You have to go through the process of raising your shields and arming your weapons and then \"entering\" combat while enemies are shooting at you. Some of their shots are incredibly lucky--I've died in a single shot before. Even once you have your shields and weapons ready, you attack by turning your ship so that it faces the enemy and you fire missiles or lasers. But such maneuverability is very tough, and I've only successfully completed it once.  I do expect it to get easier, though, and in any event you can flee from most combats if you're quick.After combat, you have to engage in the process of repairing your ship and healing your crew. This is where the engineer and the doctor come in. Some repairs require certain minerals, so I've taken to keeping a small supply of each type of mineral I find. Unfortunately, I didn't have cobalt when the situation called for it.Tomorrow night, I have to teach a college class, but I think there's a reasonable chance that class will get out early. After all, I have a new pair of coordinates to explore, and I love putting together all of this lore to learn about the universe. It feels good to be living up to my title again."}, {"title": "Starflight: Artifacts and Aliens", "date": "Tuesday, September 7, 2010", "text": "I just had to see what would happen.In my last posting, I said that I had a clue about ruins on the third planet of the home system, but I couldn't find any even though I'd strip-mined the planet for minerals. Well, it turned out I had miscounted. That was actually the fifth planet. When I realized my mistake, I went back to the third planet, and boy were there ruins.\u00a0 I landed at six locations on the planet and found three or four ruins at each site and pulled artifacts from each one. More important, many of the ruins had endurium, the mineral that powers spacecraft. From around 15 units when I started, I had about 147 when I left the planet. Since endurium retails for 1000 credits each, this was a heck of a find.Unfortunately, it cost one of my crew members his life. The planet was subject to hostile weather conditions, and Rigel was killed in an electrical storm. A lot of my other crew members took damage as I explored, too. But I returned to spaceport with a full hold and had more than enough money to train a new communications officer to a full skill level.Alas, the artifacts turned out to be a disappointment. I had two existing artifacts that the Trade Depot assured me were useful, one having something to do with communications and the other providing a shield for my Terrain Vehicle. When I came back, I had 16 new artifacts, including:3 quivering lumps2 ticking spheres2 oval objects2 pretty pictures1 strange cloth1 glowing disc1 metal ball1 frightening apparatus1 pyramid device1 mobius device\u00a0 Unfortunately, the Trade Depot told me that none of them were anything more than \"historical curios\" and offered me a slight amount of credits for each one. That was a lot of exploration for nothing. Is the Trade Depot shining me on, or are these things really worthless?You know what? You're \"totally useless\" to me!Anyway, with as much fuel as I had, I figured I was ready to start exploring the galaxy. I decided to head to the planet referenced in the \"Tribble\" clue from two days ago. On the way, though, I encountered my first aliens: the insectoid Veloxi. These aren't the same Veloxi from Arth, you understand, but distant cousins.Distant bastard cousins.I didn't cotton to their demands for three of my hard-earned fuel cells, so I said no. They responded by cutting off communications and attacking me. While I tried to figure out the combat interface...\u00a0 Well...bollocks. Starflight is a permanent death game. Not only does it kill you, but it corrupts the save files so you have to reinstall the game to play it again.Faced with the choice of having to start all over (and, frankly, probably moving on to Swords of Glass instead) or restoring from a backup of my saves, I chose the latter, even though I technically regard it as \"cheating.\" I mean, I could have done that with Wizardry or Rogue and just taken all the challenge away.This time, I played the encounter a little smarter and gave up the fuel. As you speak to each alien race, the game gives you the choice to be hostile, friendly, or obsequious. You then have the options to make statements or ask a series of questions. As you speak, the game represents your dialog according to your disposition. Take a simple question like \"tell us about your race.\" The variations might be:Obsequious: \"Oh, please, mighty ones. Can you enlighten us as to the glories of your magnificent race?\"Friendly: \"We are interested in establishing contacts with other races. Can you tell us about yours?\"Hostile: \"Transmit data about your species or be destroyed.\"These are, therefore, I believe, the first real \"dialog options\" in a  CRPG (aside from being able to answer yes or no to a few questions in Ultima IV). I don't know when we see this level of immersion in dialog again, but it's not for a while.I chose to be \"friendly\" with the Veloxi and found out some clues, including they have something called the \"Prophecy of the Egg,\" live under the direction of a queen, and believe themselves descendants of the Ancients. They also gave me a set of coordinates where they said they had been receiving a distress call from the Old Empire.This went a little better.Stopping off at my original goal, I picked up a new Old Empire message with yet another set of coordinates.\u00a0 So far, so good. I then went to the coordinates given to me by the Veloxi and found the ruins of an Old Empire ship in space, and an abandoned camp from said ship on a nearby planet. A message indicated that the ship had been the Lasthope skippered by a Captain Shelenuf of the \"Noah 9\" expedition.\u00a0 I assume, then, that Noah 2, which established Arth, was one of only many colonization missions around the same time. The cryptic message alludes to a sabotage of Noah 9 by the \"Laytonites.\" There was also a reference I didn't understand to \"mechans,\" which I took to mean androids.After that, things got weird and went to hell, in that order. Heading back to Starport, I encountered this WTF ship with its equally WTF message:\u00a0 I don't know binary off the top of my head, but I used an online converter and got a series of numbers: 1, 15, 0, 65, 3, 1, 28, 33, 24, 15, 31. No idea what these mean. The ship eventually left without telling me anything more useful.Then, close to Starport, I ran into a ship of \"mechans\" right in the place where a message in Starport had told me that androids were destroying ships. I managed to screw up dialog with them twice. The first time, they asked if my ship was from Empire technology, and I said yes. Then they asked if I was Noah 9, and I truthfully said no. They attacked. I fled, returned to Starport, sold my goods, and repaired my ship.\u00a0 Eager to solve the mystery of the androids, I returned to the same area and met them again. This time they asked me if I was a follower of Layton. Believing that Shelenuf's message indicated the mechans were in league with the Laytonites, I said yes. Big mistake.\u00a0 So, now I'm faced with the prospect of cheating again to keep playing and work out these mysteries. Or maybe I'll be true to my rules and start completely over. I'll mull it over tonight and decide tomorrow. It remains a fun game, and I can tell there's some interesting lore to uncover along the path to the main quest.In the meantime, I'd appreciate any confirmation of my binary!"}, {"title": "Starflight: Mining and Trade", "date": "Monday, September 6, 2010", "text": "Now doesn't that look better?First off, thanks to reader LordKarnov42, who clued me in to the fact that an EGA version of Starflight exists. I found it and downloaded it. The screenshots should be a little improved over the ones I posted two days ago. This process forced me to finally do some Googling and learn about the history and chronology of different video standards (until yesterday, I wouldn't have been able to tell you that EGA was better than CGA). Now I have to do the same thing for sound.As for the game itself, I'm starting to get the hang of it after a few false starts. I've yet to encounter any aliens, but I have explored several planets.When you arrive at a new planet, you take a sensor reading that tells you about its atmosphere, gravity, weather, and climate. Your crew wears spacesuits and can survive in any atmosphere or weather, but you have to be careful about landing on planets with a strong gravity. When you choose to land, the game provides you with a Mercator map of the surface and asks you to select the landing coordinates (all planets have 180 degrees of latitude and 360 degrees of longitude, just like Earth). I haven't figured out how to choose the best coordinates (absent a specific clue) except that landing in water is rarely helpful.Thankfully, we're not using a Lambert Conformal Conic projection.On the surface of each planet, there seem to be three basic things that you can encounter:Mineral deposits, which you can mine and take back to Starport to sellAlien lifeforms, some of which attack you. You can try to stun or kill them, record their biometrics, and take them back to Starport as specimens.Ruins of past expeditions or even the Old Empire, where you occasionally find messages or artifacts.I spent most of my last playing session mining one of the planets in the first star system. When you land on the planet, you exit your ship in a Terrain Vehicle that has a fixed amount of fuel and cargo space. If you wander too far from your ship (I learned this the hard way), you can run out of fuel and lose your Terrain Vehicle and have to hike back, which generally causes damage to your crew. Whether there are any valuables near your landing site is the luck of the draw, I guess. Sometimes, I hunted in vain for anything, and other times I landed in the middle of a vein of ore.Mother lode!You can load only a certain volume of minerals into your Terrain Vehicle before you have to return to the ship and dump it in the cargo bay. Your ship, in turn, holds only a certain volume based on the number of cargo pods you have purchased. It obviously makes sense to fill your hold as much as possible before returning to Starport.90%. That's what I like to see.In a few trips to the third planet of the original solar system, I had enough money to equip my ship decently, buy enough fuel for an extended trip, and train my crew to the maximum of their key abilities (I still don't know if it makes sense spending money training the Captain). I even bought a couple of useful-sounding artifacts that were in the Trade Depot.Selling minerals and items.On each return to Starport, I got a series of new messages in the Operations Room, including this ominous-sounding one. Is this the game's main quest? Stopping the instability in the galaxy's stars?Well, damn.Other notices gave hints to quests or were just goofy.I mined the hell out of the third planet of \"our own system\" but never found any ruins.Finally, I felt comfortable leaving the original solar system. I discovered the key to doing that is just to fly to its edge. I didn't go far, however--only to a neighboring system where I had a clue about ruins of the Old Empire on one of the planets.\u00a0 Following the coordinates provided by the clue, I landed on a high-gravity planet and did indeed find ruins. There was a message in one that gave coordinates for another set of ruins and made a clear references to Tribbles from the old Star Trek series....or as close to a reference as possible without violating the copyright.I also bagged a few critters on the same planet.\u00a0 Another notice had asked me to watch out for planets suitable for colonization. The game manual tells you what that means: gravity within a certain range, oxygen in the atmosphere, at least some water, biodiversity, minerals, and mild to moderate climate and weather. I found a good candidate in the second system, logged it for recommendation, and was rewarded with 30,000 monetary units when I returned to Starport.I was a little vain in the name.When I returned to Starport after my first interstellar trip, I had artifacts, a cargo hold full of minerals, and several creatures, and I was doing fairly well financially. I maxed out the number of cargo pods on my ship, Talyn, and bought several weapon, armor, and engine upgrades.\u00a0 So do I like Starflight so far? Unquestionably yes. First, there's a real sense of danger in the spaceflights. You have to pay careful attention to things like fuel, gravity of planets, and proximity of alien creatures. If you don't, you die, and death in this game is permanent.Second, there's an absurd amount of joy associated with finding a bunch of mines close together and filling your cargo hold with minerals. It reminds me of playing Pirates! as a kid and sailing into harbor with six ships overflowing with sugar, tobacco, and other goods.My only quibble is that I'm not sure it's a CRPG. So far, there's no role-playing, as such, and the character development is very limited. But I'll reserve judgment on that point until I play longer and start encountering aliens. I hope my next post will be about that."}, {"title": "Walkthroughs, Hints, and Clue Books", "date": "Sunday, September 5, 2010", "text": "I like to think I'm contributing a lot to the history and lore of CRPGs through this blog, but my personal hero is a guy named Dan Simpson. I don't really know anything about him except that he's contributed 47 files, including 23 complete walkthroughs, to GameFAQs.com and plenty of other sites. Most of them are for newer games, but he's got a few of the Ultimas, Master of Magic, and yes, Starflight, in there, too.Dan's FAQ for Baldur's Gate II is epic. It's a work of literature. The damned thing is over 143,000 words, and if you paste it into Word, it clocks in at 394 pages. Needless to say, it is comprehensive: every nook and cranny of this game, every possible outcome, is explored. More important, Dan writes well and his descriptions are just fun to read. I have almost as much fun reading the walkthrough as I do playing the game. Just looking it up to write this post, I got trapped for 45 minutes.Just a small snippet of Dan Simpson's awesome walkthrough.So who is this guy, and why does he spend so much time writing so much great material for little recognition and no compensation? If he's ever been interviewed, featured in a magazine, or offered a job at one of the gaming web sites, I'll be damned if I can find it.But here's a better question: who spends $30 on the \"official\" Prima strategy guide with a walkthrough like this available for free? Who spends any money on printed strategy guides with so many FAQs and walkthroughs available on the Internet?It wasn't always like this. Back in the era that I'm currently playing, if you couldn't figure out where to find a particular object or how to answer a riddle, you were pretty well screwed. If you were lucky, the game publisher provided a hint line. I used Origin's to win Ultima IV  the first time I played it in 1985 because I neglected to write down the runes that spelled INFINITY. Ultimately, game makers realized they could make money off of their hints, turned them into 900 numbers, and charged $1.99 a minute for their hints. I remember calling SSI's hint line when I couldn't get past the final battle in Pool of Radiance after multiple tries. It cost me something like $6.00 to hear \"the best way to defeat Tyranthraxus and his minions is to cast as many fireballs as possible.\" (Calling the hint line for this, incidentally, turned out to be a little lame. I won on the next attempt by just using different tactics.)You also had the option to purchase clue books, but remember that in the 1980s, we didn't have Amazon.com or even book superstores, so it was always iffy whether you could even find them. Some of them were quite well done, though. I remember having the clue book for The Bard's Tale, and it was basically a novel, providing hints and solutions in the context of a larger story about a party of adventurers seeking to defeat Mangar.The party failed, of course, and the magic they used to send their adventurer's log on to the next party of heroes used \"evil magic\" that erased everything they had accomplished \"from the fabric of time and destroyed,\" but their wisdom could be passed on to the next generation. Great stuff, and heck of a lot better than the official novel based on the game. (I had intended to do a special posting on game novelizations but couldn't get past the first chapter of this.)Pages from the clue book for Curse of the Azure Bonds.You could buy a clue book for each of the \"Gold Box\" games. These were less interesting than The Bard's Tale clue book, but they were at least comprehensive, with complete maps and full lists of encounters and spells. The Might & Magic series and Ultima (after V) had official clue books, too.The clue books I liked most, however, weren't for CRPGS: they were for the Infocom \"text adventures\" like Zork, Spellbreaker, and Leather Goddesses of Phobos. I can't seem to find any images online, which is too bad because they were very creative. They were written as FAQs for the most common puzzles in the game (\"How can I kill the troll?\"), but the answers were written in invisible ink, and you had to uncover them with a special pen. They started off general, getting more specific as you uncovered more lines. To encourage you not to just uncover every answer, each book featured \"fake\" questions for problems that didn't actually exist in the game, causing you to waste your ink or be led astray in your gameplay. It was brilliant.Prima, now a division of Random House, started in 1990 and swiftly grew to dominate the strategy guide market. All of their guides throw the word \"official\" in the title; does this mean they actually license the right to produce the guides from the game publishers? If so, I guess it explains why game publishers don't seem to produce their own clue books any more. But Prima's success baffles me. I would have thought they'd have a few good years before the Internet obliterated their profits. But they're still alive despite IGN, GameFAQs, GameBanshee, and hundreds of other sites devoted to both specific games and games in general.This brings me back to walkthroughs. My rules prohibit me from using them as I play the games, but I still like to read them at the end and see what I missed. If Dan Simpson is my hero for Baldur's Gate II and newer games, the king of classic CRPG walkthroughs must be Andrew Schultz. His name is on the walkthroughs I reviewed for most of my recent games: Shard of Spring, Rings of Zilfin, Might & Magic. Unfortunately, he seems to have disappeared: most of his work is dated 2000-2003 and the web sites he lists in his FAQs are no longer active. As with Dan Simpson, Googling him is fruitless because of so many other people (including a comedian) with the same name.Whether by these authors or thousands of others, walkthroughs are available for nearly every game, old and new. There's even a walkthrough for Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing, famously described by GameSpot as \"one of the worst games ever made\"--a game so lacking in challenge that your opponents on the race course don't even move.Finally, I can't talk about walkthroughs without a note on the Universal Hint System, created in 1988 by Jason Strautman. It used to require special software, but now of course it's just browser-based. The idea behind UHS is similar to the old Infocom cluebooks: only provide as much of a hint as the user needs to solve the problem. Don't spoil the game. As you click away, you get progressively more specific hints until ultimately it just tells you.Asking about where to find the Ritual of the Void in Might & Magic VI.UHS is still hawking its \"UHS Readers,\" but I'm not sure what purpose they serve with all the hints available on the web site. They also claim to pay (or \"may be willing to pay\") the hint authors. Think they'd be interested in hints for games a quarter century old? Anything pre-1995 is sorely underrepresented in the UHS.My problem with using walkthroughs is that they rob me of three things that I like about CRPGS:The satisfaction of solving difficult puzzles on my own. I felt a real thrill when I figured out the three-dimensional chess problem in Might & Magic. If I had allowed myself to use hints at all, I would have used them here.The process of mapping and meticulously recording clues.The character development that occurs while you're wandering around and backtracking, trying to find the one message, NPC, or clue that you need. This is always good for at least two more levels in the game.You might say, \"Well, CRPG Addict. Instead of taking an all-or-nothing approach, why don't you allow yourself to occasionally use walkthroughs if you really need them?\" This is a good question, but one that betrays a lack of understanding of the term \"addict.\" I have a binary personality. I either do something or don't do it; I have no ability to do something in moderation.Nonetheless, I admire people who spend the kind of time needed to write thorough walkthroughs. After posting this, I'm going to send e-mails to Dan Simpson and Andrew Schultz and see if they want to tell us a little about themselves and get the recognition they deserve. In the meantime, I'll keep restricting my own hints to what you all tell me in the comments."}, {"title": "Game 24: Starflight (1986)", "date": "Saturday, September 4, 2010", "text": "StarflightUnited StatesBinary Systems (developer); Electronic Arts (publisher)Released 1986 for DOS; 1989 for Amiga and Commodore 64; 1990 for Atari ST and Macintosh; 1991 for SEGA GenesisDate Started: 4 September 2010\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Unless you count the awful non-RPG StarQuest: Rescue at Rigel or the last five minutes of Might & Magic, Starflight is the first science fiction CRPG that I've played since starting this blog. I confess that I have very little experience with sci-fi gaming in general, with the exception of the Knights of the Old Republic games, but I agree with George Lucas that these are better described as \"space fantasy\" than \"science fiction.\"I therefore began Starflight with a little trepidation, but I can already see the potential. It says something when a 24-year-old game still inspires such dedication on the Internet; searching for the original game documents, I came across dozens upon dozens of active pages, mods, remakes, and tributes. This game has an enormous fan community.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In an otherwise meticulously-crafted game, someone should have fired the manual writer.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Starflight's fascinating backstory (told in part through a mood-killingly goofy set of \"religious writings\" at the end of the manual) begins in the year 4620 on a planet called Arth, home to several races, including humans, androids, tree-like Elowans, dinosaur-looking Thrynns, and insectoid Veloxes. Isolated in space, the planet has just discovered, 15 years before the start of the game, that it was originally colonized by travelers from Earth calling themselves \"Noah 2.\" At the time of colonization, Earth had become the seat of a galactic empire which collapsed during a Great Interstellar War with several alien races. Cut off from the empire and bombed, Arth collapsed to a \"dark age\" society but slowly regained technology over 1100 years.Arth recently recovered spaceflight, including faster-than-light travel using a rare crystaline element called Endurium. A scientific group on Arth called Interstel has used this technology to construct a fleet of starships and is now interested in exploring the galaxy. An original exploration mission involving 13 ships ended in disaster with only two ships returning, one of them having encountered distant ancestors of the Elowans and Thrynns (who hate each ohther). You begin the game as part of a second wave of exploration with 12,000 \"monetary units\" to outfit a ship and train a crew.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The \"main menu\" of the game, presented as an interactive spaceport.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You begin the game in a spaceport with five doors labeled \"Operations,\" \"Ship Configuration,\" \"Personnel,\" \"Crew Assignment,\" \"Bank,\" and \"Trade Depot.\" In the \"Operations\" room,  you find various notices, including an initial one that outlines your basic quest.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"9. Prepare argument for copyright infringement suit.\"In the \"Ship Configuration\" section, you purchase upgrades for the basic ship that Interstel has provided you with. The manual explains that Interstel doesn't have enough funds to just give you the best ship available, so you have to head out and mine planets for minerals and find other ways to make money. I could only purchase a few upgrades and still have a little left for crew training. You also name your ship in this section.\"Personnel\" is where you develop your characters. You can choose from any of the five races, but the game manual warns that you cannot have a crew with both a Thrynn and an Elowan. I decided to go with Elowans because the Thrynns seemed a little suspicious. Each race excels in a particular area: humans are good at science, Veloxes at navigation and engineering, Thrynns at communication, Elowans at communication and medicine. Androids are a special \"race\" because although they start with high statistics in navigation and engineering, they can't be trained past their starting point. The other races, you can spend money to boost their skills.This Elowan is my medical officer. Toyed with calling him \"Branches\" but figured that would be a fairly obscure joke.After creating your characters and training them with as much as you can afford, you head over to \"Crew Assignment\" and determine what role each crew member will play on the ship.Yes, I went with a theme.The roles correspond with the various skills, of course, but I'm not entirely sure what skills the \"Captain\" draws from. It also seems that you can assign multiple roles to the same character, so I'm not sure if there's any disadvantage to having only two or three characters and giving each multiple roles. In any event, I went with six separate characters.I also don't know if it makes sense to train the characters in skills that don't directly affect their assigned roles; naturally I'm going to train my communications officer in as much \"communication\" as I can afford, but does it help any of my other characters to have communications skills?I imagine the answers to these questions will become clear as I play, so I launched my newly christened ship. The game has a little copy protect scheme that depends on a codewheel, but I found a little applet that some awesome programmer named Pat Shearon made.Exploring the solar system.The game's learning curve started to hit me here. I really have no idea where to go. In the \"Operations\" room I got some hints about possible quests to be found in various parts of the galaxy, including a lost ship, mineral-rich planets, the ruins of the lost Old Empire, and some \"alien activity.\" These come with coordinates, but I haven't figured out how to enter these coordinates or see what coordinates I'm currently at. Moreover, I got the sense from the game manual that I'd be better off trying to make some money and improve my ship and skills first, but this involves landing on planets, and landing on planets involves analyzing the various sensor readings you get when you fly over them. I haven't fully figured this out yet....except that landing on a planet with an atmosphere of ammonia is probably a bad idea?What I can tell you is that in space, you have a number of options based around your five officers. The doctor can examine and treat crew members; the communications officer can hail ships (haven't encountered any yet) or send a distress call; the engineer can assess damage and make repairs; the navigator can fly, raise shields, arm weapons (haven't bought any yet), and engage in combat; the science officer can take and analyze sensor readings.The navigator's options.The captain can order a landing or take-off, inspect the cargo, and make entries into the ship's log. This latter option is actually very cool: it's the first time in a CRPG (that I can remember) where the player can type his or her own notes and annotations. Even today, many CRPGs don't offer this capability.So my goals right now are to figure out how to land and mine minerals (or otherwise make money), figure out how to go to these various coordinates I've written down, and otherwise just explore without getting killed.On the latter note, the game promises to be a little difficult. I learned the hard way that you can't simply quit Starflight; if you do, it corrupts your save game file. You have to make sure to \"save,\" but saving also makes you quit. You can only have one saved game at a time. Hence, I suspect if you die in Starflight, the death is permanent. However, the game manual recommends that you back up your saved games, so I'm toying with not regarding this as cheating.Oh, and I have to figure out the game map, which confounds me just to look at it. None of the planets (I think they're planets) are labeled, and I have no idea what the various lines, whorls, and colors mean.Again, Starflight seems very promising and fun if I can get past this learning curve. Remember, I'm forbidden from looking at walkthroughs, so I'd appreciate any (non-spoiler) tips in the comments."}, {"title": "Shard Of Spring: Final Ranking", "date": "Saturday, September 4, 2010", "text": "If anyone knows how to wield a sword with \"fierocity\" (or, indeed, what \"fierocity\" means), please comment.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Shard of Spring United StatesStrategic Simulations, Inc.

Although it has some interesting features, and it anticipates better games from SSI, its primary virtue is that it's over quickly.1. Game World. Nothing special here: an island, a Golden Age ruined by an evil sorceress, a quest for a MacGuffin. The island doesn't really have any interesting backstory or lore, just some scattered towns and dungeons. The game world does not react much to your presence. Final score: 2.2. Character Creation and Development. A few unique elements with five playable races, including trolls, but only two character classes. No alignments, no sexes. Method of rolling attributes is challenging and unusual and the \"skill\" system, while a good idea, is not as good as Wizard's Crown: you can't \"improve\" a skill, and by the end of the game it's pretty easy to get them all, so there's no reason to have your characters specialize in just one. Leveling is satisfying and valuable. Final score: 5.\u00a0 3. NPC Interaction. The game has a few NPCs, but you don't really \"interact\" with them so much as you step on their squares and they tell you things. You have to talk to people in bars and dungeons to get hints for the future, but otherwise no dialog, no role-playing. Final score: 1.4. Encounters and Foes. The foes are standard fantasy fare and the game doesn't bother to describe them. Even the \"monster lore\" skill only tells you a few basic things about your enemies. Different monsters do have a variety of different abilities in attacks and magic, and you have to think tactically when you face them. Because the game throws a battle at you ever 33 moves (a regularity that frankly becomes annoying once you notice it), you never have to worry about running out of fights. Final score: 3.5. Magic and Combat. Probably the best part of the game. The magic system is different and intriguing, allowing you to channel as many spell points as you want into each spell to increase its chance of success and potency. There aren't a lot of spells, but they're divided into different schools of magic that are unique to this game. Combat is very tactical, forcing you to carefully consider deployment patterns, movement distance, and enemy priority. Between the combat decisions and magic options, a lot of strategy goes into combat, and yet it's not as confounding as Wizard's Crown. It still manages to be a little boring sometimes, especially towards the end, but on the whole a strong suit of Shard of Spring. Final score: 7.Fritz prepares to roast some spider meat.6. Equipment. A limited variety, items are not described, and the identification process (each spellcaster can only identify one item per day) is annoying. You can't sell equipment that you find. The game manual does provide tables to help you rank their relative worth. Final score: 3.7. Economy. You get money for each battle and thanks to the high cost of healing and resurrection, you never really run out. There is otherwise not much to buy with your hard-earned cash, however. Final score: 4.8. Quests. The main quest is banal and derivative. There are only a couple of bona fide \"side quests,\" and neither offers much in the way of role-playing value. All quests have only one possible outcome. Final score: 2.9. Graphics, Sound, and Inputs. Bad. Monochrome and uninspired. Much better work was being done by other publishers in this era. Final score: 2.10. Gameplay. The game is very linear and has no replay value. The level of difficulty is good, though, and it doesn't overstay its welcome. Final score: 4.Final Ranking: 33. This puts it on par with Wizard's Crown, which makes sense to me.Matt Barton (Dungeons & Desktops, pp. 107-109) agrees with my assessment that it's \"a bit crude,\" with primitive graphics and sound, but notes that it helped pave the way for the \"Gold Box\" series. If nothing else, Shard of Spring whet my appetite for Pool of Radiance. But before then, I have to get through a series of other games, starting with Starflight."}, {"title": "Shard of Spring: Won! (You Bastards)", "date": "Friday, September 3, 2010", "text": "Happy?Well, it was so important to you that I finish Shard of Spring that I spent the entire week winning it. I was so eager to plow through it that I neglected to post anything Wednesday or Thursday, which I should have done, because this one is going to be pretty long.Shard of Spring ends up being a pretty linear game. You know how I feel about that. As you move across the landscape, you encounter towns and dungeons in a very specific order, and while you can blow past them and jump right on to harder dungeons, it's very inadvisable to do so, because 1) you need objects that you get in previous dungeons to fully complete subsequent ones; and 2) they're too hard if you don't do them in order. There are five or six dungeons plus a bunch of little tombs, and most of them are quite small and uneventful. Once I found the towns that had training academies and allowed me to level up, I got through all but the last one (the evil sorceress Siriadne's castle) very quickly. A bunch of random notes, comments, and screen shots:Most of the wilderness is very empty except for the occasional battle. Unfortunately, you don't see your enemies coming--they don't have a little approaching icon as in, say, Ultima IV. The game just throws you into battle.For most of the game, I assumed that the battles were random. But I began noticing that if I got into a battle and died, when I reloaded I would face another \"random\" battle in the same number of moves. I realized that instead of being random, the game throws a battle at you every 33 moves (moves include saving, walking, and turning). I discovered that the only way to avoid a battle was to quit on the 33rd move, right when it would have normally hit you with one.My internal role-playing rules do not allow me to quit and reload just because a battle goes badly. I can only reload when my entire party is wiped out. This meant I spent a lot of time and money resurrecting and healing characters, and progress was slow-going, especially in the final dungeon.Towns where you can get training are in far-flung locations that require a lot of hiking and combat. This is an odd decision because you effectively cannot win these combats until you get trained. It took me a long time to get my wizards off Level 1. Training is pretty satisfying, though. You get attribute increases, hit point increases, spell point increases, and the option to purchase new skills. By the end of the game, all my characters had all their available skills.The maximum character level in the game is 20, but eventually it becomes virtually impossible to level up any more. As it was, I spent hours fighting random battles just to get my characters up to Level 10. Your experience point rewards for some of the toughest battles in the game, especially towards the end, are paltry. You also don't start getting heaps of gold until the final few battles, when it hardly does you any good.This paltry reward was from a dungeon bossEnemy spellcasters suck. They can kill your party members with a single spell starting at Level 4. When you encounter them, you basically have to pray that they choose not to cast those particular spells. Again, a lot of time and money spent healing.The magic system is actually fairly original. There are a lot of unusual spells organized into five schools or \"runes\": fire, metal, wind, ice, and spirit. Each has a mixture of single-enemy attack, mass attack, healing, and protection spells. For instance, fire has COLUMN OF FIRE (single attack), FIRE STORM (mass attack), MELT (contradicts a FREEZE spell), and FLAME SHIELD (protection). Each spell has a minimum number of spell points needed to cast it, but you can channel more points into it if you want to increase its potency. I can't think of any other games that let you vary the amount of magic power you put into a single spell.There were piles of rings, rods, and other magic items in the various shops which I a) was never sure what they did; and b) never bought because I never had enough money what with all the resurrection.A walkthrough I consulted after winning the game tells me I missed an entire dungeon called \"The Tunnels.\" I looked for it, but I don't see it. Maybe that's a difference in the DOS version of the game.So winning the game involved, as I said, visiting each dungeon in sequence, collecting items, and writing down clues. Each dungeon had a \"big bad\" somewhere in it, and these got progressively harder, but oddly enough, random encounters within the dungeons were usually more difficult than the scripted battles. This remained true all the way up to the final battle with Siriadne. I got slaughtered by a party of 6 greater dragons right outside her door, reloaded, skipped by the dragons, and the final battle against her only featured two such dragons.The Swamp King was disappointingly easy.The game wasn't very unique in its monsters, featuring the usual selection of bats, snakes, kobolds, orcs, fighters, wizards, elementals, gargoyles, and so on. One exception is the mysterious \"Bugem,\" which seems to be an anthropomorphic ant capable of carrying weapons.Each dungeon featured a selection of scripted encounters with foes, but only a couple of puzzles, no dialog options, and no opportunities for role playing. Just a few random screenshots from scripted encounters:Ultimately, of course, I made my way to Siriadne's castle, which (predictably) was surrounded by lava.It was by far the longest dungeon in the game, with about 10 levels and numerous fights against elementals and demons.There was one puzzle that required me to touch a series of gems in a specific order based on a throwaway clue from a previous dungeon. I'm glad I wrote everything down.I also had to use a two-part password (each part obtained from a different dungeon or town) at a gate, and it took me forever to realize that I needed to \"cast\" the password. That really wasn't intuitive at all.Finally, I reached Siriadne, who gave me a standard \"villain speech\" (there's a special topic in there) before attacking me with two greater dragons.Oddly, Siriadne herself (bottom of the next screenshot) has the icon used in the game for kobolds and orcs. If there was an in-game explanation for this, I never saw it. It took me a long time to beat her. At one point, I used a teleport spell to escape the dungeon, fought some battles until I leveled up again, and re-assailed the tower. Even then, my party was nearly wiped out by the time I reached the final battle and it took me four tries to win it.But when I did, I got a somewhat mystifying endgame write-up: A cool breeze blows through the huge arched windows of the tower room. On an ivory pedestal lies the object of your quest: a knife-shaped piece of green crystal. As you hold the shard and look out over the landscape of Ymros, it looks beautiful and peaceful;more peaceful than it has looked in a very long time.You watch as a graceful dove flies up from the balcony below up into the blue sky. As you turn to go back into the room, you see a black bird out of the corner of your eye, moving swiftly upward. As you re-enter the room, an old man who you recognize is standing near the dead body of Siriadne. His face shows a mixture of serenity and contentment. He speaks: \"The true springtime shall now return to Ymros because of what you have done today. Your names shall be remembered as long as men exist to sing of you.\" He makes some mysterious motions and everything begins to swirl about you. His voice speaks to you out of the dizziness: \"Evil is personified in the form of dragons, but borne in the hearts of men...\"Okay, huh? First off, who is this guy? I must have missed something obvious in my race to finish the game, because it says my characters recognize him, but I sure don't. Second, wouldn't a \"mixture of serenity and contentment\" look pretty much like either one by itself? Finally, what is that last line about dragons? It's not like they played a big role in the game.The mysterious man's banishing spell (thanks for that, by the way; I didn't want a parade or anything) stuck me back at the starting town, where I promptly headed to the pub and bought a drink. Mixing with the fellow townsfolk, I heard:Now, I know that we're well before the era when games actually acknowledge you winning the game within the game, but this is just discouraging. How hard would it have been to overwrite the \"tavern talk\" file or something?Finally, another tavern tale in another town promises a sequel:I can't wait. But in the meantime, it's off to the final judgment on Shard of Spring and then Starflight."}, {"title": "Shard of Spring: Meh", "date": "Tuesday, August 31, 2010", "text": "The big boss in the first dungeon.Shard of Spring isn't exactly a bad game; it's just that nothing's grabbing me. It seems like a good game for 1983, about three years earlier than it was actually published. After Might & Magic, though, the limited inventory, monochrome images, and basic quests that Shard of Spring offers seem a little lame.Since I last posted, I built up my characters a bit with outdoor combat and outfitted them with the best weapons and armor that the first town had to offer.  I'm above what the manual says are the number of experience points I need for Level 2, but apparently I need to find a guild to train my characters up to Level 2, and there's none in the two towns I've discovered so far.I explored the first dungeon, Black Fort, rescued a priest, and killed the evil ruler of the dungeon.The dungeons do offer a combination of random encounters--lots of 'em--and fixed encounters like the one below:Just FYI, his skill and ferocity availed him naught:The combat, as I said earlier, is fairly tactical. You can't sleepwalk your way through it. The game does offer you the ability to rest, but only every eight hours or so, and even when you do, you don't fully heal. Thus, it's more like Wizardry than Might & Magic in that you're forced to conserve spell points and try to survive a series of combats instead of one combat at a time. As much as I like the tactical nature of the game, the combats are extremely repetitive and the limited amount of movement makes them annoying. My troll character hardly ever gets to fight because by the time he actually makes it over to a foe, the combat is usually over. Mostly the game makes me anticipate the similar but better combat I know I'll find in Pool of Radiance.After each battle, I find at least one weapon. These need to be tediously identified, however, by my spellcasters, each of whom can only identify one per day. I have a huge backlog of weapons waiting to be ID'd. When I do identify them, they turn out to be basic maces and swords, and since the game doesn't offer you any option to sell weapons, I guess I just have to drop them.I'm glad I found an online manual, though. Without it, I wouldn't even be able to play: at every startup, the game asks you a question from the manual as a copy protect feature.1980s DRMThe manual is also necessary to understand the spells. When you cast them, you have to type the full name (as far as I can tell). This is a little annoying for such incantations as COLUMN OF FIRE and BREATH OF LIFE.So I'm torn about finishing this one. On the one hand, I keep hearing about how cool Starflight (my next game) is; on the other, I hear that Shard of Spring is over fairly quickly. Moreover, school is back in session this week, and I'm taking two classes and teaching three, so perhaps I'd better stick with an easy game I already know. I also have a bias towards finishing games if I'm going to be playing their sequels, and Demon's Winter is coming up in 29 games. Any opinions from people who've played Shard of Spring to the end? Does it get more interesting?"}, {"title": "Game 23: The Shard of Spring (1986)", "date": "Saturday, August 28, 2010", "text": "Oh, good!

I don't know whether this was released before Rings of Zilfin or not--just that they were both released in the same year.  Shard of Spring feels in many ways more like an SSI game; you can feel the transition between Wizard's Crown and Pool of Radiance happening here. The creators are Craig Roth and David Stark, who worked on this and it's sequel, Demon's Winter (coming up in 29 games). (Roth now seems to be a technology analyst, and Stark's name is too common to figure out where he is now.) The main game screen seems proud of the fact that it was \"written entirely in Microsoft QuickBasic v. 3.0,\" which I gather is something like writing an orchestral composition for a kazoo.First, the back story. Here's the first line from the manual: \"For two centuries, as the rest of the land lay baking in the desert sun or freezing in the winter wind, the small island of Ymros enjoyed an eternal spring.\" It transpires that someone called the Red Sorcerer decided that Ymros was too special to go through normal seasonal changes like the rest of the world, so he used sorcery to enchant a piece of the LifeStone and twist the world's climate and environment to his whim. He stuck this enchanted Shard of Spring in a crystal in a place called the Green Shrine. While the rest of the world suffered the regular vagaries of nature, the people of Ymros enjoyed continual spring. How they grew any food is left uncertain--presumably they used similar sorcery to just steal it from other lands.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Suck it, mainland!\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Some centuries later, an environmental crusader named Siriadne sent some of her followers to destroy the shrine and take the Shard. She then levied a punitive fine against the people of Ymros for benefiting from these dark arts for so long, demanding gold and food instead of turning Ymros into the \"icy wasteland\" that it deserved. Rather than learn its lesson, Ymros decided to raise a group of adventurers and steal back the abominable artifact.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The global-warming-causing Island of Ymros\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I may have filtered this description through 21st-century liberal sensibilities a bit.Character creation is nothing particularly new, allowing you to choose from only two classes (warriors and wizards) and five races (human, dwarf, troll, elf, and gnome). It's not quite that much of a choice, because dwarves and trolls can only be warriors and gnomes and elves can only be wizards. You get up to five characters in a party. Each character has a familiar set of statistics: speed, strength, intellect, endurance, attack skill, hit points, and spell points. These are rolled randomly but have modifiers based on race. You get to choose attributes to re-roll, but you can only re-roll three times.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 There is a bit of originality in the game in the way that you assign \"skills\" to your characters. In addition to sword, axe, mace, and different wizard skills, we have karate, dark vision, berserking, hunting, persuasiveness, and tactics (which allows you to identify what party member a monster is targeting). As I start the game, it appears that the skills are binary: either you have them or you don't; there's no ongoing skill development as in Wizard's Crown.I created one \"paladinish\" human warrior character (Roland) with sword, persuasion, and tactics skills, a standard dwarven fighter type with axe and berserking skills, and a troll brute with karate and armored skin. The spellcasters were more difficult. Spell skills take a lot of intelligence. I created an elven wizard with fire and wind abilities and a gnome wizard with metal, ice, and spirit magic. I always feel slightly lame creating a party with one of each race or one of each character class in a party-based CRPG, like I can't commit to any one theme. A bolder decision would have been to try an all-troll party or something. Why don't we agree that I'll do that when I get to games I've already played?\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The heroic anti-environmental crusaders.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Your party launches from the town of Green Hamlet, where, if you visit the bar, you can get what appears to be your first quest: the rescue of a priest from a local dungeon called Blackfort.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wandering outdoors is much as in any top-down party-based game like Ultimas III and IV or Wizard's Crown.

You move your characters around the battlefield to engage enemies with weapons or spells. Each character has a certain number of movement points (based on speed) that determine how far he can go and how many attacks he can make when he gets there.\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The neat thing is that the combat map is a blown-up version of the game map.

Whether I \"like\" the game is going to hinge, I suspect, on how interesting the various encounters and role-playing choices are. SSI has been a mixed bag so far, with both games I found tedious (Wizard's Crown) and those I found interesting and fun (Phantasie).

It did get a little harder, with enemies having more hit points and doing more damage in the second two kingdoms, but it never got very hard, and in the entire game, my character never once died. That's a sure sign of a too-easy CRPG.The game is full of mushrooms and plants that maximize your damage while minimizing the damage that enemies can do to you.Rings of Zilfin is not a pure CRPG; it's more of a RPG-adventure game hybrid. I say this because there are a lot of inventory-based puzzles in the game, and you can only win after performing a series of tasks in a precise order. You'll recall that in my last post, I was leaving the kingdom of Deloria for Begonia on a quest to find the kidnapped King Rolan. This, to the best of my recollection, was the sequence of events that followed:Went to a cave and used a series of words (given to me in Deloria) to open a passageMet with the lost Zilfins, who told me how to rescue Rolan from the Dark Tower, home of the demon assassin Dzomon, and gave me the code word to use the RingsBought a pearl and took it to a sorceress named Zara, from whom I got a magic seed, which I planted to grow a tree from which I fashioned a Staff of GrummEntered the Dark Tower using the code word, used the Staff of Grumm to defeat its mystical guardians, got to Rolan in time to hear his last words, which were to seek the Ring of Zilfin from a halfling named Sam in Sumaria. (By the way: \"Rolan\" and \"The Dark Tower\"? Were the creators of Rings of Zilfin reading Stephen King's The Gunslinger or were they, like King, inspired by Robert Browning's poem?)Killed Dzomon on my way out of the Dark TowerMoved on to SumariaCollected a bunch of quest items from stores: a rope, a key, a flute, a magic cloak, a cookie, a book of riddlesDefeated the dragon Bogum to find the Treasure of Fulgarsh, which included a magic harpHe was even less happy moments later.Gave Sam the halfling a book of riddles and showed him King Rolan's amulet, which made him trust me enough to give me his Ring of Zilfin (Dragos had the other)Used the rope to descend into a dungeon called \"The Well,\" battled past monsters to find the lost kingdom of the Elves, enchanted them with my flute playing, gave the elf king the magic harp in exchange for a horn to summon a mystical flying creature called an Ankha, which could fly me to the otherwise-inaccessible Castle GrazBribed a water dragon with a cookie to reach an island where a wizard gave me a magic shape-changing elixirFlew to Graz, got past the guardian by bribing it with drugsFought my way through the castle to the evil DragosFooled Dragos by using the elixir to transform myself into the appearance of his demon god, ordered him to give me his Ring of Zilfin, used the code word, turned him to ashOh, there was some character-building stuff in here, too--I maxed out my strength and got to spell level 3--but mostly I was running around with these various errands. It felt a great deal more like King's Quest than, say, Might & Magic.How did I know how to do all of these things? Well, the game offers you numerous ways to get clues, including wandering monks you meet on the road, helpful bartenders, fortune tellers, and passers-by in towns. The game forces you to visit each location, interact with everyone, and assemble your task list from sometimes-arcane clues like \"Three words will do it!\"Bit by bit, it comes together.I didn't make a screen recording of the end game, but here are a series of screenshots that show how it progresses:The game ends with a series of questions about unresolved mysteries, suggesting that a sequel might be in the works......but if one was ever made, I can't find any evidence of it. I'm not complaining. Rings of Zilfin was passable light entertainment, but it was not a great CRPG.****Let's do a quick final reckoning on the GIMLET scale:1. Game World. Reasonably good back story about the lost Zilfins and the rise of the evil Dragos. If a bit derivative, at least offers some original elements like the inaccessible castle and the drug-addicted guardian. Generally the gameplay itself does not live up to the manual's backstory. Score: 5.2. Character Creation and Development. Barely a CRPG in this regard. No creation decisions, assigns you a default name, only a few basic character statistics and hardly any control over character development. Nothing customizable about the character at all. Score: 2.3. NPC Interaction. Only the basest sort. You talk to them and they tell you things. No dialog, no opportunity for role playing. NPC interaction is necessary, though, to figure out the plot.  Score:3.4. Encounters and Foes. A handful of monsters, some unique to this CRPG, but most of them only distinguished between those that cause physical damage and those that cause magic damage. No random encounters. Areas do respawn. Score: 3.5. Magic and Combat. Very, very basic. Only combat options are to attack with sword, shoot an arrow, or cast a spell, and there are only 12 spells. No role-playing opportunities in combat. Score: 2.6. Equipment. All kinds of different items, but most are either quest items or trade items. Only four types of weapons and three types of armor, none very well described. Score: 2.7. Economy. Horribly unbalanced, too easy to get rich, hardly anything to spend your money on (except healing, which is cheap). Score: 1.8. Quests. One main quest, very linear, no side quests. Main quest has only one outcome. Score: 3.9. Graphics, Sound, Inputs. All primitive, even for the era, although there is some fun animation in the cut scenes. Score: 3.10. Gameplay. Very linear and constrained, more like an adventure game than a CRPG. Far too easy, and not replayable at all. Only bonus is that it doesn't take very long. Score: 2.Final score: 26. The best I can say is I liked it better than Ultima II.It was a nice, easy game for a month in which I have been extremely busy, but I'm looking forward to SSI offering better fare down the road."}, {"title": "Rings of Zilfin: An Easy Game (Except for Poison)", "date": "Friday, August 27, 2010", "text": "\"Argh! Venom!\" is right. Why does every game have to have poison?Well, I owe my readers a debt. Bereft of the game manual for Rings of Zilfin, I asked for assistance. Ziad and Calibrator sent me key information and Stu posted a link to the manual itself. I'm not sure why this didn't turn up in my Googling, but it made things a lot clearer. Thank you, everyone!Here's what the manual clarified: the land of the game is called Batiniq, and it's being conquered by an evil necromancer named Dragos. I'm some kind of Child of Destiny who was given a quest by the ghost of my dead mother to find the two Rings of Zilfin. The Zilfins were a \"great race\" that used to rule Batiniq but \"became extinct after the battle of Bihun, many years ago.\" This leads to the introduction that I described in the last post. Dzomon is \"a vicious demon, strong right arm of Lord Dragos.\" Dragos seized one of the Rings when he took the Zilfins' old castle, but he's still seeking the other, along with the fabled treasure of King Fulgarsh, which was carried off by a dragon. So...yeah.The manual also helped with a lot of the navigational and logistical aspects of the game.With this in hand, I see what Matt Barton means by Rings of Zilfin being a game \"for novices.\" It's horribly easy. There are a limited selection of commands, only a handful of different weapons, three combat actions, and about a dozen spells. At first, I thought that figuring out what the different mushrooms and plants do was part of the challenge, but no, the manual tells you straight off.The game consists of exploring a series of screens arranged within three kingdoms: Deloria, Begonia, and Sumaria. I've only explored Deloria so far, where there were 22 locations, including cities, towns, castles, wilderness areas, and special encounters. Each town has two or three buildings which might be shops, inns, residences of various NPCs, or temples dedicated to Dragos in which acolytes try to kill you. You have to explore all of them, as well as talk to various NPC passers-by, to figure out how to get through the game. Here are some of the many locations:A town with three houses to visit.Killing Dragos's minions in a temple. Note that my sword skill increased.One of many villages to explore and speak to NPCs.A monk along a roadway. His comment reminds me (not in a good way) of Ultima II.Fighting an evil creature on a bridge.A ruined village.In between towns are roads along which you can pick up mushrooms and plants (all beneficial in some way), talk to NPC monks, and drink from fountains. Occasionally you get attacked by orcs or goblins, and at nighttime there's a risk of different flying monsters, which you have to shoot with your bow. I ran out of arrows at one point, which was annoying because I just had to stand there and take the damage until the critters decided to fly away.Lacking arrows, Reis must stand passive to the Denzils' attacks.So what makes the game so easy? A few things:Early in the game, you can buy the best armor (heavy armor) for a fairly small amount of gold. This greatly reduces the damage you take and even makes you immune to some monsters.There are only two key characteristics: endurance (hit points) and fatigue. You start off with a small amount of each, but there are several locations with healers who, for only a little gold, will heal you to your maximum of both. Then there are different fountains and mushrooms that will increase this maximum, but it doesn't cost any more to heal yourself after the increase. The upshot is that I started out with about 400 hit points and now I have 9,000, which I think is the game maximum.Gold is absurdly easy to get. The game introduces a trading system by which you can buy goods in one town and sell them in another. (This same type of system appears in other games, including Might & Magic VII, but I think this is the first time I've seen it in a CRPG.) The variance between the selling price and the buying prices is so high that in just a few trips between nearby towns, you can have the maximum gold in the game.The only characteristics to improve are strength and sword skill. Sword skill improves more-or-less automatically as you fight. Strength required me to visit one location to train and up my maximum \"potential strength\" and then another location to up my actual strength. Still wasn't too hard.The game got easier once I increased my STRENGTH!Once you up your strength and buy a better weapon to go with it, most enemies--at least the ones in Deloria--die in just a couple hits.There are a few annoyances in the game, including the aforementioned flying monsters, plus the fact that every time you save, the game quits. Every fourth or fifth time you visit a store, you get pocket-picked for some of your gold, and this is one of many games of this era that requires you to keep a food supply. Visiting the towns is an annoyingly long process of watching your little character march across the screen as he enters the village and goes from house to house.And then there's poison. God, how I hate poison, and every damned CRPG not only has to include it but also make it horrifically deadly. Was Wizardry the first? In that game, there were many ways to get poisoned, including different creatures and chest traps that your thief always sucked at disarming. Getting poisoned meant losing hit points every step, and until a fairly high level you don't have a cure spell. The same is true in Ultima IV: step into a marsh or encounter a poison trap early in the game, and you might as well just restart. In the Gold Box D&D games, getting poisoned means instant death unless you have a level 4 \"neutralize poison\" spell.$&^#*$ poison.Rings of Zilfin is full of pools along the roads, some of which help you by increasing your endurance or fatigue, but at least one out of every three is a poisoned pool, which immediately reduces your fatigue and endurance to 0, which means you die the next time you take any damage. A plant called an Iola will cure you, but these are exceedingly rare. Essentially, you cannot risk drinking from a pool unless you have an Iola, and once you find an Iola, you use it again almost immediately. Man, I wish CRPGs would just ditch poison.All right. Back to the game. In the first third of it, in addition to increasing my stats as described above, I had to find a wizard named Eklun who taught me level 1 magic (there are only three levels), although I frankly didn't find any of the spells very useful.I visited a castle where the denizens told me that King Rolan had been kidnapped by Dragos and was probably being tortured for his knowledge of the second Ring of Zilfin. They sent me on to the next kingdom, Begonia, to get more information on his possible whereabouts.Entering the next kingdom involved battling my way through a mountain pass. There were a lot of flying creatures in the pass, but nothing I couldn't handle.I can't exactly recommend Rings of Zilfin, but it's definitely an undemanding game. I'm going to go ahead and finish it, mostly because I haven't finished one since Might & Magic and I'm too busy with work to learn a new game from the beginning right now. I'll let you know if it gets more difficult or more interesting.*****Just a quick administrative note: I track the number of visitors to this site using Google Analytics, which also tells me where y'all or from and what brought you to my site. I got a spike earlier this month when a user named zzajin posted a link to my blog on a message board at RPGWatch.I must say I'm amused by the discussion that followed, with some posters calling me things like \"beyond stupid,\" \"naive,\" and possessed of a \"mental disorder.\" (To be fair, there were some nice comments, too.) But I did want to make a few things clear:1. I do not have children. I don't know where anyone got this idea. If I did, I don't think I would be able to maintain this blog.2. I don't care if I ever \"finish\" the list. The point of this project is not to reach the \"end,\" close the blog, and mark it off my \"to do\" list. The point (for me) is to achieve something moderately productive while simultaneously satiating my addiction. Maintaining this blog--spending time on something that people like to read--is a tangible, positive outcome from something that would otherwise just be an exercise in self-indulgence.3. No matter how long I go between entries, I'm in no danger of quitting. I have a lot of professional commitments and I travel a lot, so occasionally I can't play games or post for a long time, but no matter how long I go, I will always be back--at least, as long as \"blogging\" exists as a technology.Thanks to everyone who reads and comments--you give me a reason to keep at it."}, {"title": "Character Classes & An Apology", "date": "Monday, August 23, 2010", "text": "I reached the point this month where overindulging in my CRPG addiction would be career suicide. Please bear with me, and I'll do my best to continue with Rings of Zilfin as soon as I can.So we don't utterly waste the week, let me toss out a question about character classes. In a single-character game, what is your default character class, and in a multi-character game, which of the classes in your party do you most identify with? And why?I tend to default to a paladin, which mystifies me a bit because in real life, I am anything but pious or lawful. Perhaps I just find them easier to role play. For instance, I can integrate the six-party maximum in most games by pretending that my paladin is sworn to travel with no more than five companions (any more than that, and he's leading an army). In contrast, I hardly ever go with a spellcaster as my primary class. I think this is because there comes a time in every game in which you reach a boring stretch and you just want to pound your way through it with brute force.

(developer and publisher)Released 1986 for Apple II and Commodore 64; 1987 for Atari ST and DOSDate Started: 16 August 2010\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When I last posted, I said I was going to try out several different games and go with the one that I took to the most strongly, so I could actually finish it. Well, none of them really did. This wasn't the fault of the games, I'm sure. I'm facing one hell of a busy week, and I was hoping for a game whose mechanics I could figure out immediately--something like another edition of Wizardry, or Might & Magic. Since none of the games fit this profile, I decided to stick with Rings of Zilfin, which was next on my list anyway.I was excited about another SSI game--I'm eagerly awaiting the day that Pool of Radiance comes up on my list--but this game doesn't feel like an SSI offering so far. In Dungeons & Desktops (2008), Matt Barton calls Rings of Zilfin \"a game intended for novices\" (p. 109). Barton should try playing it without a manual--I couldn't find one anywhere. Mostly I have no idea what I'm doing, and I'm trying to feel my way through it.Let's start with what I do know. The game is notable in that it starts with a cut scene. I'm not 100% sure this is a first for CRPGs, but I honestly can't remember encountering one previously.Please note that I did at least hesitate for a little while, though. I'm not a total wuss.The story that the animated scene tells casts you in the role of Reis, an apprentice wizard from the village of Sham. One night, you awake in a cold sweat, having dreamed about hordes of goblins. You receive a telepathic warning to \"run for your life.\" Grabbing some food and weapons, you run out the door into the woods, just in time to avoid a demonic assassin named \"Dzomon,\" sent on behalf of a nameless master.At this point, the introduction says, \"so begins your quest...for the Rings of Zilfin.\" Huh? There's a hell of a \"yadda yadda yadda\" in there somewhere. I have no idea what the Rings have to do with Dzomon, my attempted assassination, or the quest. Maybe that becomes clearer later.The game then tosses you onto the open road, where you can wander from town to town. Along the road, you encounter different types of mushrooms and plants (I've figured out what a few do through trial and error), pools of water that sometimes offer good benefits and sometimes poison you, and a variety of monks who give assorted clues.This monk was not particularly helpful.At the end of the roads are various towns with different buildings that you can visit. Some of the buildings house shops, some inns, and some temples with monsters. There are also wandering townspeople. Again, the purpose seems to be to get various clues.Just like the swamp boots in Ultima VI.I don't know what a prihny is, and I don't know why I'd want a witch to help me, but thanks!Occasionally, you encounter monsters. As far as I can tell, there are just two forms of attack: sword and bow, and I'm almost out of arrows. I'm not sure what purpose combat serves, since you don't seem to get experience points from your victories. There seem to be just two major statistics: endurance (damaged in combat) and fatigue (damaged by walking or running, especially if you don't rest for a night). I'm not quite sure how to restore either.Combat with...actually, I have no idea what.My plan right now is to keep exploring and mapping, and hope that something of a main quest becomes clear. In the meantime, I would love any clarification from anyone who has played this game--or a manual if you have one."}, {"title": "Game 21: Larn (1986)", "date": "Friday, August 13, 2010", "text": "\"Good luck! You're going to need it!\" is always a bad sign.About 10 months ago now, when I hit upon the idiotic idea of playing every CRPG that ever existed, I downloaded and started Rogue. I hadn't begun this blog yet, so you missed out on a blow-by-blow recap of my experiences, which I summarized in two postings, four months later, after I finally won. It amuses me to think what my blog would have looked like if I'd started it last October:Day 1: Started Rogue. Died almost immediately. Re-started. Died again.Day 2: Died again. Re-started. Got down to level 3. Died.Day 3: Died 16 times. Re-started. Died.I think I would have lost my readership fairly quickly.This will be my only posting on Larn. I apologize to the many roguelike fans out there--and there seem to be many who are fans of Larn specifically; there's even a blog just about Larn--but really, once I tell you stuff about the basic gameplay, there's really nothing else to blog about except how many times I died that day. Even if I was inclined to spend four months seeking the MacGuffin of Yendor again, you wouldn't want to read about it.At least Rogue didn't have exploding chests.Larn is an embellished roguelike. As with most roguelikes, the graphics are very sparse. Your character is represented by an @. Monsters are letters. Walls are pound signs (#). And so on. Interaction is through a fairly large selection of keyboard commands in which capitalization matters. You don't want to mix up (r)ead a scroll with (R)emove gems from throne, because the latter has a nasty habit of sending a gnome king to kill you.You can read about the basic approach to this kind of game in my postings on Rogue. Almost everything holds, including permanent death (the game deletes your save file every time you start up). Larn's additions are:Your quest is not to recover the Amulet of Yendor, but rather a potion that will save your daughter from dianthroritis. Someone who's taken Latin, help me out.\u00a0\u00a0The game is not timed by your own starvation, causing you to press forever downward to get more food, but rather by an actual time limit. You have 300 \"mobuls\" to save your daughter. There are scrolls which set back the clock a bit.You can backtrack within dungeons to upper levels.There are things to find in the dungeons that seem to have been inspired by DND or Telengard, including thrones, fountains, and altars.The game starts you in an outdoor area with shops and a training college where--for precious gold and mobuls--you can improve your stats.The game is addictive, I'll give it that. I just got a major government contract that I have to finish by September 30, but damned if I didn't spend the entire day playing Larn instead.It cost $235 of your tax dollars to make this map of level 1.I went through about nine characters today, never making it past level 3 of the dungeon. I could see keeping this game around and dipping into it from time to time, but I can't see making a concerted effort to finish it.Swarmed and killed by giant ants.Oh, I suppose some of you are wondering what happened to Moebius. I just wasn't getting into it. In a comment on my one Moebius posting, reader judgemonroe said: \"So far I'm not thrilled with the gameplay. I don't have the hang of it yet, I guess, but the controls feel very sluggish and I keep starving. I have no idea where to get more food and water.\" That pretty much sums up my experience. The game is also very chaotic, constantly chirping at you about earthquakes and famines and droughts. Tigers and beetles come flying at you from nowhere; thieves run off with your stuff. In another time, I would have given it more of a chance, but I need something a little less bizarre to get back in to the swing of things after a 10-day absence. My next three games--Rings of Zilfin, Shard of Spring, and Starcraft--are all 1986 games, and I suppose I could play them in any order. I'm going to give each about an hour to see which \"takes\" the best because I want to go the distance on my next one."}, {"title": "What Have You Learned?", "date": "Tuesday, August 10, 2010", "text": "Everything I know about sailing, I learned from Pirates!All right, first off: another apology. It has escaped none of my regular readers' notices that I have not posted in 12 days. I was on another of my interminable business trips, this time to the Pacific Northwest. It was a bad time to be taking a break. My blog had its best day ever on Wednesday, August 4, when I had 1,357 visits. This seems to coincide with user Knife_Ninja posting a link in the \"gaming\" subreddit. As much as I appreciate it, I would suggest regular readers check out the much-underused CRPG subreddit. I really like the comments I get here, but you can't beat Reddit's ability to thread and vote on the comments. Speaking of comments, I have something like 60 over the past 10 days, but I will try to respond to them.Anyway, I need to get back into Moebius. In the meantime, since my last open-ended question seems to have generated so much discussion, let me try another one: what have you learned, if anything, from CRPGs?I am partly influenced to ask this question because of a quote in Matt Barton's Dungeons & Desktops (2008), which I wrote about in June. Although I have generally liked this book very much, and relied on it several times, I was moved to uproarious laughter by an early passage:CRPGs are not only the most fun and addictive type of computer game, but possibly the best learning tool ever designed. They are truly grand adventures with real rewards for dedicated players (p. 3).It would be one thing if this was just hyperbole (honestly: the best learning tool ever designed?), but far from simple exaggeration, I have to regard this statement as an out-and-out falsehood. I see CRPGs as rewarding in the same way that heroin is rewarding: you feel good while you're doing it. After you've done it, you can't help but think you'd have been better off spending your time and money on something else--and yet, you know you'll be doing it again. Lots. Yes, there is a dark side to the title of my blog.The second-best learning tool ever designed.But let's assume for a minute that there is some kernel of truth to Barton's statement. Except for a brief pop psychology reference in the same paragraph, he doesn't really bother to back it up, but I'll proceed on the assumption that he's seeing something that I'm not. What skills have you learned, what talents have you developed, from playing CRPGs?I've already written about how Ultima IV's virtue system developed my own early pathways into moral thinking, so I'll give CRPGs that. Beyond that, I've racked my brain and I can only think of a few others:I have a basic sense of medieval weaponry and armor. I can walk through the Higgins Armory Museum in Worcester and remark to my companion, \"that's not a mace; that's a morning star.\" I know what a coif, greaves, and gauntlets are.My knowledge of monsters in classical mythology has been fleshed out. Of course, I have no idea which monsters come from which mythologies.I can use with confidence a number of terms I might otherwise be uncertain about: charisma, constitution, paladin, bard, necromancer, reagent.I have a sense of the most efficient pathway to find my way through a maze, whether corridors or streets (note: this doesn't come up that often).I shall escape your hellish subdivision!That's honestly all I could come up with. When you contrast this with all the things that CRPGs get wrong (e.g., you can't carry six suits of armor at once; sword thrusts almost invariably kill you in real life; you don't actually get stronger and more powerful as you get older), it almost seems like a wash.I do have to hand it to Pirates!, though. Thanks to that game, and it's excellent manual, I have a general sense of the political situation in the Caribbean from 1560 to 1680, my knowledge of Caribbean geography is encyclopedic, I can identify a sloop from a galleon, and I know how to tack a ship (conceptually, anyway). Too bad it's not a CRPG.So enlighten me. Make me feel better about my endless slog though CRPGs: what have you learned from these games?"}, {"title": "What Were They Thinking?", "date": "Thursday, July 29, 2010", "text": "While I explore the game Moebius and gather material for my next posting about it, I want to stop and consider a question that's impossible not to consider while playing Moebius: can a bad gameplay element spoil an entire game?I'm thinking yes.In the case of Moebius, I refer specifically to the character icon that you have to stare at for most of the game: an enormous, cloaked head and top of a torso that stares creepily out at you. Your foes look the same. I almost can't bear the thought of looking at this for a couple dozen hours of gameplay. Didn't this bother anyone else during development?This got me thinking about other games that have been ruined--or at least marred--by a particular element of the game. I'm not talking about substantive things, like Wizardry's permanent death or The Bard's Tale II's boring, interminable dungeons. I'm talking, rather, about peripheral or stylistic elements that should have been easy to change in the development stage. Obviously, a lot of them are going to come down to pet peeves, but this is the list I came up with:Baldur's Gate: \"You must gather your party before venturing forth.\" Seriously, once should have been enough.Ultima II: Space travel, fine, I can deal with it. Being able to land and walk around on Jupiter, no.Ultima VII: I always choose the black character portrait because the one white guy looks like a baked out surfer. Seriously, like 90% of their players must be white males, and that was the best they could come up with?\"Hey, dudes...\"Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal. Cespenar. Yeah, he's cute at first, but having to cycle through all of his inane chattering every time I want him to examine my backpack makes me want to punch my cat.Neverwinter Nights: The Stone of Recall. It utterly breaks the game.Might & Magic VII: No respect from your own townspeople. You spend all this time upgrading your castle and building a peaceful Harmondale, and the guards still tell you to \"move along.\"Oblivion: When the main quest is about stopping an invasion from hell, it seems irresponsible to do any of the side quests. Morrowind got around this by having Caius Cosades tell you to go out, explore, build up some experience, but there's no good role-playing reason to do that in Oblivion. Also, the character creation process allows you to choose from a detailed and nuanced selection of facial features, body styles, and hairstyles (including size, shape, and color for all of them)--except that there's no \"bald\" option. Which I happen to be.I'm sure I'll run across many more. What are some astonishingly absurd or obnoxious gameplay elements that you've found?Finally, here's one about the industry: why do game companies make it so hard to buy their older games? Instead of bitching about abandonware sites, why don't copyright holders offer their own versions of old games for download at a minimal cost? I'd gladly pay $5 for Ultima IV or The Bard's Tale or Pool of Radiance from a legitimate seller, but the owners offer no such recourse. I realize that many of these companies are out of business, but surely someone still owns the copyrights and can create a basic web site. I'm frankly worried about what's going to happen when I enter the \"games that require a CD in the drive\" era and find that there are no more copies of Baldur's Gate or Might & Magic VII to be had."}, {"title": "Game 20: Moebius: The Orb of Celestial Harmony", "date": "Wednesday, July 28, 2010", "text": "Moebius: The Orb of Celestial HarmonyUnited States ORIGIN Systems (developer and publisher)Released 1985 for Apple II, 1986 for Commodore 64, 1987 for Amiga, Atari ST, and DOSDate Started: 28 July 2010\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 What a difference a couple of years makes! I was amazed when I  started up Moebius: The Orb of Celestial Harmony and saw introductory  screens like this:He's not Chinese! Neither, incidentally, is the Moebius strip, which has no particular Asian origins. It notably appears in Ultima IV as the ultimate answer to the summation of truth, love, and courage: infinity.I have no idea what's going on down below, but it's damned impressive.Granted, the DOS version of this game is from 1987, two years after the original Apple II version, but it's still astonishing that photorealistic effects and animation have advanced so much in such a short time. I'm guessing the introduction of the VGA graphics card standard in 1987 probably had something to do with it.Even though I haven't caught up with where I was at the end of Might & Magic, I've decided to stop \"backtracking\" at this point because I want to give Moebius proper attention. From what I can see so far, it's an authentic CRPG, and it's exclusion from the Wikipedia list is thus somewhat mystifying. (So is the fact that I'd never heard of it until a couple of weeks ago.) This means back to my original rules.Moebius is notable in a lot of other ways. It is the first CRPG (that I know of) based on eastern philosophy and themes. Perhaps an exception is Ultima IV with its inclusion of avatarhood, but this is really just the use of a term. Moebius is set in a quasi-Asian fantasy kingdom with frequent use of Asian (or, at least, pseudo-Asian) symbology, names, weapons, and combat styles. Confucius quotes appear throughout the manual. There aren't many other games that do this. I think of Jade Empire and...any others? (Other than JRPGs, of course.)The \"yin-yang\" symbol appears frequently in the Moebius materials. Fun fact: what I've always called the \"yin-yang symbol\" is properly called a taijitu. Variations appear in Celtic and Roman art, and it was introduced in Taoism in the 16th or 17th centuries C.E., representing the interplay of opposing forces. The light and dark halves are commonly and erroneously thought to represent good and evil, but \"evil\" is rather the consequences of imbalance in opposing forces. History/theology lesson over.The game takes place in the formerly-peaceful realm of Khantun. The evil monk Kaimen has stolen the Orb of Celestial Harmony from his master, Moebius the Windwalker, and has set up a fortress on the Plane of Fire from which he is wreaking havoc across the land. Since the Orb \"holds in effect the forces of dissolution that are inherent to our land\" and allows passage through the elemental realms, Moebius is stuck on his own plane and Khantun is suffering a variety of natural and monster-based disasters. Complicating things is that Khantun has no army (\"since the Windwalker showed our people the path of peace, there has been no need\") to stand against Kaimen's horde of evil monks. That task falls to the player and the aged monks who will aid him.Moebius was designed by a game developer named Greg Malone and released by Origin Systems. There are echoes of Ultima IV in the game, with its emphasis on virtue in the form of \"karma,\" but you can also sense Richard Garriott's lack of direct involvement with this one, especially in the combat. The initial stages of Moebius deliver two fairly original features. First, before you head off on your adventures, you go through three training sessions: sword combat, hand-to-hand combat, and meditation (which involves keeping a floating orb within a defined box through the use of the arrow keys). This is an early, if not the first, example of a feature I've come to like in later games: tutorials. I prefer to learn the interface a little before I head out into the game world. In this case, I learned a valuable lesson about your fatigue level: striking when it's low barely causes any damage.Fighting mano-a-mano with a palace guard. Incidentally, \"mano a mano\" means \"hand-to-hand\" in Spanish, not \"man-to-man\" as some people think. That would be \"hombre-a-hombre.\" Yes, I'm full of them today.The second feature is action-based combat. You fight in real time by blocking your enemy's attacks and making attacks of your own. There are a variety of high, middle, and low kicks and punches (or sword thrusts) to choose from, and figuring out the best one to use in any given situation means carefully watching what your opponent is doing. Matt Barton calls the game \"Ultima Meets Karateka,\" which I guess was a popular karate game of the time.The assassin staggers from my sword blow. The word \"assassin\" comes from the Arabic \"hashshashin,\" which in turn derives from the common belief that assassins were under the influence of hashish during their killings. This belief has led directly to current U.S. drug policy. Okay, I made that part up. I think.In the final part of training, you have to learn to keep an agitated, floating taijitu within a box by using the arrow keys. It took me a while but I found it much easier once I reduced the CPU cycles in DOSBox.Having finished training, I began the Moebius adventure by leaving the temple and heading out into the troubled land of Khantun and what in the name of Confucius is that disembodied head floating around? It is, regrettably, me--and the subject of my next posting.Edit on 07/15/2013: I didn't like this game so much that I stopped blogging about it after this posting, but because I didn't even play it long enough to assign a rating, I always felt bad about it. I finally went back and finished the game three years later. Here's the second and final posting."}, {"title": "Backtracking: Cavequest (1985)", "date": "Tuesday, July 27, 2010", "text": "This is one of several mini-reviews of CRPGs I missed in my first pass, which I explain here.\u00a0\u00a0 What do you suppose will happen if I send $35 to that P.O. box in Florida?\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Cavequest is a shareware CRPG developed in 1985 by a company called Lightwave Consultants. As far as I can tell, it's no longer around, and this was its only game. That's too bad, because there's some promising stuff here. I'm not saying it will compete with Dragon Age: Origins for your attention, but it's definitely a break from the norm.The text files that come with the game set up the outline of a plot: once the people of the land lived in peace and harmony until they plumbed too deep in a set of caverns and broke through to a \"Land of Evil\" from which monsters spilled forth. In response, the gods flooded the land to destroy the scourge, but now, generations later, a town has been built above the cave, excavations have re-started, and the foolish townsfolk have broken through again. To stop the plague of monsters, Zeus has sent your character from the Land of Gods to fight them.  The introductory screens show you launched through a field of stars before you find yourself in an equipment shop on the edge of a cave of five levels.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The game starts you with a certain number of points which you first use to \"buy\" your attributes: intelligence, strength, dexterity, stamina, charisma, and magic ability. You have to be careful not to spend it all because the game converts any remainder to silver, which you then use to outfit your character, choosing from several armor types, weapons, shields, and missile weapons. After you make your initial purchases, you visit the magic shop where you can enhance your armor or blade with magic and buy several other magic items.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In the cave, you wander through the hallways, collecting treasure and slaying enemies with your sword, lances, or arrows. There are secret doors to find and open. As you move and swing, you deplete your \"restedness\" statistic , and of course enemies' attacks deplete your \"health\" statistic. Waiting restores them. The speed of the restoration depends entirely on the processor speed, it seems, so if I crank DOSBox up to a few thousand CPU cycles, I'm practically invulnerable. The downside is that monsters become so fast they're near invisible.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The depletion of your \"restedness\" score is dependent on the weight you're carrying plus your strength. This little shareware CRPG is thus the first that I know to have a \"fatigue\" rating based on weight and movement. While I admire this innovation, it's relatively annoying, as you have to keep stopping and waiting for a recharge in the middle of exploration.As you kill monsters and collect treasures, you accumulate \"life points\" which can be spent on upgrades to both your character's statistics and equipment. Both this game and Wizard's Crown came out the same year, and I'm not sure which allowed the direct expenditure of experience points this way first, but either way it's impressive.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And yet, while this is another game whose innovations I admire, it still isn't \"fun\"--not like Ultima IV or Might & Magic. The graphics are very bad and the combat is extremely simplistic. I'm glad I was exposed to it, but there doesn't seem to be any evidence of a main quest--you just kill, find treasure, and improve--so I'm not sorry to be moving on.This is my last \"backtracking\" post. Although the next game, Moebius, was released earlier than Might & Magic, it's a full CRPG and I want to play it with my usual dedication and rules. Thanks for bearing with me while I covered a few of the more notable missed games. From now on, I'm going to be supplementing Wikipedia's list with MobyGames and other sources.****Further reading: Six years later, I spent a little more time with the game to give it a proper number and rating. I also realized that it's part of the Quest lineage, starting with Quest 1 and Super Quest.

I recommend ignoring it and reading my full posts on The Yendor's Castle and Leygref's Castle instead.Amulet of Yendor and Leygref's Castle are both remakes of Wizard's Castle (1981) which I reviewed a couple of postings ago. They are both roguelikes from the mid-1980s, and neither of them have aged very well, especially compared to the 1985 remake of Rogue that I played many months ago.Amulet of Yendor (this is the MobyGames name; in the game itself it seems to be called Yendor's Castle) involves a quest to retrieve the Orb of Power forged by the elven wizard Yendor. It takes place on an 8-level dungeon with 64 rooms (8x8) each. As in Wizard's Castle, the rooms contain various monsters, pools, chests, books, treasure, vendors, and other assorted items. You have to fight monsters to find an artifact called the Runestaff which teleports you to Yendor's Orb. Winning the game involves leaving the dungeon with Yendor's Orb in your possession, at which point you are given a score based on the treasure you've collected and the monsters you've slain.After an equipment buy, you're off to the dungeon. Mapping and exploration are complicated by random teleporters (\"warps\") and sinkholes which toss you about the dungeon randomly. In my first time out, I got warped to Level 4 before I knew what was happening, and I was killed in short order by a dragon. My second time out, I literally made one move from the entrance and got tossed down to Level 8 by a warp/sinkhole combination.The \"map\" only displays for a couple of seconds, even when I slow DOSBox down to a crawl; I don't know if this is a deliberate game design or a technical issue.Every time the game starts up, it takes you through six screens of instructions which are apparently inescapable, meaning dying sucks more than it did in Wizard's Castle.I played six times but never lasted more than about 25 turns thanks to the balrogs and dragons the game cheerfully throws at you even on Level 1.Leygref's Castle is essentially the same game but with much more tolerable graphics and gameplay. You are once again after an Orb of Power, this time forged by the elf wizard Leygref instead of Yendor. Other than the name change, the instructions are word-for-word identical to those in Amulet of Yendor (although this game helpfully gives you the opportunity to bypass them). Improvements include a map that remains in front of you throughout the game and more information about your status and inventory on the screen. There are a few other tricks introduced by the game, including a mysterious jerk called \"The Phantom\" who shows up and steals your stuff and the chance of going blind (I was never able to cure this). The author of this one, a Frank Dutton of either Texas or Louisiana, deserves a lot of credit for this version, and if you're really eager to play one of the Wizard's Castle derivatives, this is the one I'd recommend.Both games randomly regenerate the map when you start a new game, allowing (in theory) an infinite number of variations in the game. But both keep Wizard's Castle's baffling conflation of strength and hit points. As shareware games, they're an amusing diversion."}, {"title": "Backtracking: Zyll (1984)", "date": "Sunday, July 25, 2010", "text": "This is one of several mini-reviews of CRPGs I missed in my first pass, which I explain here.Of Zyll, Matt Barton (2008) writes: \"Unfortunately, this highly innovative game is virtually unknown today\" (p. 91). We need to change that, because--to a CRPG archaeologist, at least--Zyll is simple, pure pleasure. I started this blog to discover games like this.In Zyll, you play a young warrior, wizard, or thief on a quest to recover the great treasures of your kingdom (the Land of Magic and Enchantment) from the evil wizard Zyll, who has stolen them. You also must steal Zyll's black orb--the artifact that gives him his power and has allowed him to turn your kingdom to a wasteland. There are other minor treasures to take, too, and the game isn't just about \"winning\" but rather achieving the highest possible score when you do.The game is entirely text-based, with detailed written descriptions of all the areas. When you start out, for instance, you are told:You are at a small shelf on the top of a cliff. There is a mist in the air, and you can see a magnificent waterfall cascading down the mountain. You also see:The ledge continue to the southA sharp downward slope to the westThis type of description sounds very familiar to anyone who has played Zork or the other Infocom text adventures of the era. But unlike these games, Zyll is a real CRPG, with different classes, an inventory of armor and weapons you can find and wear, random encounters with monsters, and combats based on statistics. Oh, you could quibble that the game lacks certain CRPG elements: you can't name your character, for one, and there's no character development. But it's at least a quasi-CRPG, and I like it.CRPGs have made it impossible for me to explore abandoned wells in real life. I'm always disappointed when all I find is spiders and trash.The game consists of exploring a castle and its surrounding area, finding treasures (which are randomly placed), solving light puzzles, picking locks, mapping, collecting inventory items you need to progress (like keys), and slaying wandering trolls and skeletons.Combat in Zyll is text-based, but your chances of winning depend on your equipment, your strength, and random die rolls, just like a CRPG.But I haven't covered the coolest part yet: the game supports a second player! Moreover, this other player can play in \"competitive\" mode, trying to find the treasures of Zyll before you do, or in \"cooperative\" mode, working with you to save your kingdom. Both players play in the same game window using the same keyboard--\"in effect,\" Barton says, \"a MUD playable on a single nonnetworked computer, a novel concept then and now.\"The interface is a little cumbersome on a modern keyboard. Instead of typing in commands (as in Zork), you choose from a selection of commands using the function keys (F1-F10). Because F10 is \"Other\" and gives you another screen of options, there are as many as 19 different actions (not including sub-actions) available at any given time. The commands were mapped to the corresponding function keys on the IBM PC/XT keyboard, which were arranged in a group on the left hand side. With modern top-level function keys, you have to pause and count the order of the commands before you know what key to press. It's annoying but not fatal.The IBM PC/XT keyboard.The second player uses the number pad on the right. His commands and text description are also on the right-hand side of the screen. Thus, although both players had to use one keyboard, the game took advantage of the layout of the keys and kept them from interfering with each other. Ingenious, really.Zyll in two-player mode. Note that player 1 (a thief) sees a wizard and player 2 (the wizard) sees a thief.Mapping in text-based games can often be a challenge, and Zyll is no exception. With four cardinal directions plus up and down movements, passages that twist and bend, one-way tunnels, and other assorted challenges, you can start with maps like the one below, but you usually end up drawing them by hand.The game occurs in real time, and damned if I could find any way to pause it, so you have to be careful about bathroom breaks, stopping to write a paragraph for your blog, or other time outs because you're liable to get eaten by a wandering lion. I really want to win this one, if for no other reason than it doesn't seem like it should take that long, but the interface keeps doing me in. I keep getting attacked and getting flustered figuring out what function key to use to fight back or run. More than once, I've gone to attack and ended up dropping my sword instead.If I end up winning, I'll post the screen shot and a few other paragraphs, but I suspect I will give up before that. Nonetheless, I recommend Zyll for people who don't have a list of near 1,000 games in front of them."}, {"title": "Backtracking: DND (1984), Caverns of Zoarre (1984), and Heathkit DND (1985)", "date": "Saturday, July 24, 2010", "text": "Note from the future: Writing from March 2015, I see several inaccuracies in this quick \"backtracking\" post. First, the \"excellent web site\" I mention in a minute actually has numerous inaccuracies, particularly as regards the dates of the games. Second, I say that Daniel Lawrence's DND is \"not the same as the PLATO dnd,\" when in fact I later discovered that they're very much the same game. You can read more about the history of this line in my postings on The Game of Dungeons and Dungeon of Death as well as a full posting on Caverns of Zoarre and DND.Note from further in the future: And now in April 2016, I've discovered that there is no such game as \"Heathkit DND\" and that the game given that title is from 1981, not 1985. Read my updated posting. Basically, you just want to skip this posting entirely. Before I even begin my review of DND, I want to recognize an excellent web site.http://www.digital-eel.com/files/dndpage_files/DND.htmThe owners of this site have meticulously cataloged each version and outgrowth of DND, including the developer's earliest BASIC code as written on mainframes in the 1970s (unfortunately, by the page's own admission, it's questionable whether you could actually get these to run anywhere). The site has all the playable DOS variations released in the 1980s as well as some modern tributes and remakes, including one--Realms of Quest--made by one of my frequent commenters. More pages like this would make my work a lot easier.The author of the original DND (which is not the same as the PLATO dnd, perhaps the earliest CRPG) is Daniel Lawrence. I haven't been able to find much about him, but regrettably it appears that he died in Lafayette, Indiana, just last month, at the age of 52.In Dungeons & Desktops (2008), Matt Barton covers some of the history of the game and its variations. As I said, Lawrence developed the original version in the 1970s and for almost a decade ported it from one computer system to another, leaving various versions in his trail, some of which were picked up and tweaked by other developers. By the time Lawrence decided to commercialize the game, there were any number existing on servers all over the place. In 1982, Avalon Hill published Telengard (the name of one of the dungeons in DND), which I already reviewed. Around the same time, another developer (all of my references call him \"Bill\" but don't provide a last name; a little sleuthing determines it is William M. Knight, Jr., whose company is still around) modified the source code and created a shareware version called DND through R.O. Software and ended up in a legal conflict with Lawrence and Avalon Hill. Caverns of Zoarre (1984) and Heathkit DND (1985) are also variations of the original DND created by different developers.DND (1984)The upside to all of this is that I'm not playing the original DND, but the version created by \"Bill,\" complete with an exhortation to send $25 to R.O. Software in Plano, TX. The version comes with five dungeons, but only two are listed as \"ready for exploration.\"In the game, you play a single character. You begin by rolling the standard six D&D attributes and choosing from fighter, magician, or cleric classes. You name your character--for some reason, the game also asks you to give a \"secret name\"--and boom,  you're in the text-based dungeon, where you wander around, fight monsters (only two options: attack and evade), collect treasures, find random encounters like teleporters and thrones, gain experience, and--quite often--die. Almost everything I wrote previously about Telengard is true of this game, only with more primitive graphics. It's still slightly addictive, but not enough for me to linger. I got my character up to level 3 and was reasonably rich when I died for the last time.Caverns of Zoarre (1984)Caverns of Zoarre was developed by a Thomas Hanlin III of Springfield, Virginia. (This is getting eerie; I have friends in both Plano and Springfield.) He wants $25 for the instructions to the game, but I largely figured them out for myself. After rolling random stats (no wisdom), you choose from a fighter or sorcerer, decide whether you want a \"freen\" (yeah, no idea) and head into the eponymous caverns. As in DND, as you wander you enjoy random encounters (although less often) with monsters and treasures. The graphics are a little more advanced, at least in terms of your own character and the walls, but there are no graphics for monsters and other encounters. As with DND and Telengard, it's pretty tough to survive for very long.\u00a0\u00a0 Except for the freen--clue me in, someone, please--and the presence of \"uruk-hai\" and \"ugluk-hai\" monsters, there's nothing terribly original here. [Later edit: Again, please check out my updated post on this game, including a winning screen shot.]Heathkit DND (1985)That's what MobyGames calls the game, anyway. As far as I can tell from the splash screen, it's just \"DND,\" although set in the \"Heathkit Dungeon.\" I have no idea who developed it; there are no clues in the accompanying readme file or online.The game adds color graphics and, like Telengard, forces you to play in real time, so if you're trying to write a blog entry at the same time, you keep getting attacked and dying.The game also adds a quest. The objective, the manual says, \"is to find the Lord Master of the Heathkit Dungeon\" who is located in some kind of vault. You discover the combination to the vault piece by piece as you progress through the game. You can save your character in this one--death is not completely permanent.Beyond that, the gameplay is again remarkably similar to Telengard in the nature of foes you encounter, objects you find, and commands to navigate around. It even has altars that call you \"pagan trash\" if you gyp them with too little gold!  As the first game with an actual \"main quest\" since I started backtracking, I'm tempted to try to finish it...but I'm more anxious to get caught up to where I was before I discovered the existence of these extra games.So that's my whirlwind review of the DND \"franchise.\" In many ways, this has validated my original (albeit unknowing) exclusion of these games. I had already played their best exemplar in Telengard. They're not bad, exactly, but Caverns of Zoarre came out a year after Ultima III, and Heathkit DND is the same year as The Bard's Tale. The age of viable shareware and freeware CRPGs was coming to a swift (but temporary) end.****Further reading: Posts on the entire DND line: The Dungeon (aka \"pedit5,\" 1975); The Game of Dungeons (aka \"dnd,\" 1975); Dungeon of Death (1979); Telengard (1982); Caverns of Zoarre (1984); DND (1984); and the Heathkit DND (1985)."}, {"title": "Backtracking: StarQuest: Rescue at Rigel (1983)", "date": "Friday, July 23, 2010", "text": "[Ed.

Later, there were CRPGs that had graphics that, while they were nowhere near the capabilities of modern graphics engines, were \"good enough\" to not distract you from the game.In between these two stages was a transitory stage, mercifully brief, in which the graphics, sound, and inputs are so bad that you wish the designers had just gone with text. The games from this era are virtually unplayable today, except as historical curios, because you can't stop retching at them. Ultima II falls into this category. So, regrettably, does StarQuest: Rescue at Rigel.StarQuest is an early \"roguelike\" game. I am indebted entirely to Mobygames's description of the plot, as I can't seem to find a manual anywhere.In Rescue at Rigel, you take the part of Sudden Smith, a human  adventurer teleported down by transporter beam inside a six-floor,  sixty-room complex inhabited by an alien race, the Tollah. Scattered  throughout the base, which has been hollowed out of an asteroid orbiting  Rigel, ten humans are held captive, one in each of ten different rooms.  While you can adjust the difficulty of the task, the object in all  cases is the same: to search the complex, find and release as many of  the prisoners as possible (by activating the transporter beam, which  will teleport them back up to the ship), and get out alive-in an hour or  less.Shooting a \"common tollah\" with a ray gun. How dare Ebert suggest this isn't art.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 In this blog so far, I have played a number of games that I thought were pointless or goofy (my worst venom remains for Ultima II; I can't believe that was part of such an otherwise excellent series), but I've never played any as painful as StarQuest. I'm not knocking it--I'm sure it was a joy at the time. But unlike just about any CRPG I've reviewed in this blog, there is no way on heaven or earth that this game could be remotely \"fun\" to modern players. Movement is extraordinarily cumbersome (you hit \"L\" or \"R\" until you're facing the right direction and then type the number of steps you want to move) and the controls are often nonresponsive. The quest is extremely basic--you wander around until you find 10 humans and hit \"T\" to transport them home.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Saving a hostage from a...you know what? Screw this.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You encounter a series of creatures--aliens, monsters, robots--that you simply blast by hitting \"F\" or \"B\" on the keyboard--no skill about it. As far as I can tell, there's hardly any reason to fight them because you can just wander out of the room. There's nothing to find but hostages and monsters, your character never gets any better and...you know what? This isn't even a CRPG, really. Forget what I said about it being a \"roguelike\"--it just looks like a roguelike. It has none of the elements that make up a true CRPG. I'm going to have to look at Mobygames's classifications with a jaundiced eye from now on.Any key? How about ALT-F4?"}, {"title": "Backtracking: Oubliette (1983)", "date": "Thursday, July 22, 2010", "text": "This is one of several mini-reviews of CRPGs I missed in my first pass, which I explain here.I'm going to go with \"rite of passage.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OublietteUnited StatesIndependently developed for PLATO educational systemReleased 1977; commercial version released for DOS in 1983Date Started: 22 July 2010\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I've coded Oubliette as a 1983 game simply because that's when it was remade for DOS, but the original version was written in a PLATO mainframe in 1977. It and a handful of others were children of a popular game called dnd (based on Dungeons & Dragons, of course) that was written around 1975. Understand that in this era, games were noncommercial, and freely traded and added to by programmers. We might think of dnd as one game or 50 depending on how many variations we want to include. The same problem exists with early Roguelikes. I'm finding a lot of confusion among a number of 1980s Roguelikes: Hack, DND, Telengard, Amulet of Yendor, Heathkit DND, Larn, and so on. Some I may not to be able to play at all. (You Google \"DND\" or \"Hack\" and see if you can find a link to an obscure 1980s DOS game amidst everything else.)Anyway, back to Oubliette (the term is French for \"dungeon,\" but literally meaning \"place of forgetting\"). The basic game setup is that the game world, called Tokal, is a harsh and cruel place full of monsters and competing tribes of humanoids. A great wizard named Ligne established the world's one outpost of civilization: a town/castle with a deep dungeon in which various monsters were thrown. \"As the dungeon and city above matured, it became popular among the young citizens of the city to venture into the dungeon, seeking gold and glory, almost as a rite of passage.\" You control a party of such adventurers.My short-lived motley crew. \"Crush\" is an ogre.I don't know how much of this game is based on the original code and how much was added for the 1983 DOS release, but either way it's pretty [expletive] cool. I found a text-based manual on a C64 site, and I can't believe the amount of innovation they packed into a game this early--including elements we see in no other CRPG. For instance:You choose from eight races when creating your characters: dwarf, elf, gnoll, hobbit, human, kobold, ogre, and orc. The \"monster\" races advance more quickly in levels but are also short-lived (apparently, characters die of old age frequently in this game, and unlike in Might & Magic, there's no way to reverse it). Elves and dwarves live a long time but also advance very slowly. I know of only one other game--Phantasie--in which it's possible to play so many varieties of \"monster\" characters.There are an incredible 10 classes: hirebrand (fighter), mage, sage, priest, peasant, ninja, thief, paladin, samurai, ranger. The nature of the classes anticipates later, more advanced games, in their skills. Hirebrands are raw fighters, paladins combinations of hirebrands and priests, sages combinations of priests and wizards, and so on.The game offers D&D's set of six attributes, and like in Wizardry (in fact, I can see this game's influence on Wizardry) the attributes determine what class you can choose. Your race and sex also modify these attributes. Again, this is very advanced for a 1983 game, let alone the original 1977 version.Once you create your character, you have to choose a guild to join for your \"apprenticeship.\" There are 19 guilds, but restricted based on class and attributes, I guess. Once you join, three things can happen: 1) you graduate, and your age and attributes advance accordingly; 2) you fail to graduate and become a peasant (albeit playable); 3) you die during training. The latter is apparently common with some of the shorter-lived races. If you fail to graduate, you can re-enter, but at a cost of time. I created a human samurai who flunked out the first time at the age of 23. I re-enrolled him, and he graduated the second time--but when he was 51. Ouch. Anyway, this guild thing is very creative and unique to this CRPG.New Player, I hardly knew ye.There are six spell levels for both clerics and priests, with three or four spells per level. This is where the game's influence on Wizardry is more obvious (or did Oubliette add them for the 1983 re-release based on Wizardry?), as each spell is given a cryptic name--TOKSHEF, NARFIET, FEHALITO--many of which sound like their Wizardry counterparts.After you create your characters, you outfit them, of course, but you start with a random amount of gold and who knows what you can afford. Fortunately, Grundig (owner of the general store) sells \"pointed sticks\" for 2 GP--better than fists, I suppose.Once you enter the dungeon, you're faced with a familiar screen, if a bit primitive: your party listed up top, a wireframe graphic representation on the right, and a window telling you what's happening on the left. Again, the comparison to Wizardry is remarkable.\u00a0 In combat, you face a group of enemies and have several options, from a standard attack to a more risky one that does more damage. You can also evade, cast a spell, or use an item. Thieves--or specifically female thieves--have the unique option to try to \"seduce\" the monster. If it works, the monster joins your team and fights at your side for the duration of the combat. If you fail, you die immediately, so it's a risky move. Only your first two characters can attack, unfortunately, and there are no missile weapons, so everyone else pretty much just stands there until they've earned some spell levels (you start off with none). If one of your characters dies, you have the option to (B)ury them in the dungeon! I don't know if this serves a practical purpose or if it's just great role-playing.Unfortunately, according to at least one strategy guide I found online (remember, the normal rules don't apply to my temporary backtracking), there is no main quest or way to \"win\" the game. That might be a good thing, because I might be tempted to finish this one if there was a way to finish it. If I was reviewing this in the proper order, earlier in the project, I might play it for a few entries and give it a proper chance, but as it is...well, I've got places to be. Still, if you're into old games and want an original experience, give Oubliette a try.****Note: Several years later, I played the original PLATO Oubliette and offered some additional thoughts on this game.

I recommend that you just jump to that one.] We needn't spend a lot of time on Wizard's Castle (1980), even though it shows enough promise to be slightly addictive if I gave it a chance. It is an entirely text-based game, similar to the earliest versions of Rogue. As Matt Barton says in Dungeons & Desktops (2008), it is notable less for what it is and more for how it was released: it was printed as 5000 lines of BASIC code in the magazine Recreational Computing. I'm not really sure who I have to thank for the DOS executable version I'm playing.I don't know if you can read the screenshot above, but the setup is that:Many cycles ago, in the kingdom of N'Dic [yes, really], the gnomic wizard Zot forged his great ORB OF POWER. He soon vanished, leaving behind his vast subterranean castle filled with esurient monsters, fabulous treasures, and the increadible ORB OF ZOT. From that time hence, many a bold youth has ventured into the wizard's castle, as of now NONE has ever emerged victoriously! Beware!!In the following character creation screens, you can choose from an elf, a dwarf, a man, or a hobbit and then choose your sex. You start off with points allocated to strength, intelligence, and dexterity (based on sex and class) and a pot of 8 additional points you can distribute as you wish. You then buy some starting equipment with a limited pool of gold pieces.You control your character through a series of text commands, primarily moving one of the four cardinal directions through the game map. The (M)ap command brings up a \"map\" of the level, which is an 8x8 grid. Each of the \"squares\" in the grid contains either nothing (represented by a period) or an encounter (represented by a letter). The encounters are varied, including (M)onsters, (V)endors, (T)reasure, (B)ooks, and stairs (U)p or (D)own.In combat, you have three options: (A)ttack, (R)etreat, or (B)ribe. I'm not sure what the mathematics are behind the attack. I dispatched a bear and a troll handily enough but then was slain by a balrog--quite a challenge for the first level! Oddly, you don't seem to have any hit points; getting hit depletes your strength.\u00a0 An interesting game, and one that again shows some influence on Rogue (the character creation process is frankly more advanced in Wizard's Castle), but not one I'll be playing until the wee hours of the morning.Nope, not nearly foolish enough.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Barton praises the game for its coding efficiency but concedes that it is \"a fairly simple game, with no graphics and only a meager story.\" Keep in mind that Richard Garriott was selling Akalabeth the same year, which featured actual graphics in two different perspectives.

He describes the series as a lesser-known younger sibling of many of the more prominent series of the decade (e.g., Ultima, Wizardry). King and Borland don't mention it once in Dungeons & Dreamers (2003). But, as we've seen, the game did \"refine several gameplay elements that would show up in later games, such as having the characters' race and gender exert a strong effect on gameplay\" (p. 128). Barton calls the game \"a labor of love by developer Jon Van Canegham and his wife Michaela\" and he praises the size of the game world, the number of encounters, and the mystery of the main quest. It made, he says, \"a great impression on critics and gamers\" (p. 129)--an impression that still holds favorable 24 years later.As usual, my ranking is based on the 100-point GIMLET scale that I described here.1. Game world. This is a tough one. Might & Magic launches you into the world of Varn (or VARN, as it turns out) with very little background and with no lore or history. You are left to explore the world and piece together its nature through quests--this is part of the game's fun. The world itself is large--around 50 16 x 16 maps--and varied in its terrain and encounters. Although graphics limitations make the dungeons and castles look mostly the same, each has a certain distinct character and purpose.  The revelation at the end--that the game world is simply a biosphere/spaceship--makes Might & Magic unique among games, I'll give it that. But it also raises a lot of questions that the game doesn't begin to answer. How do fantasy conventions like magic and undeath fit within the sci-fi framework? Who thought it was a good idea to combine people and dragons in a spaceship? (Here's hoping Michael Bay never stumbles upon this site.) For that matter, don't the dragons bonk their heads against the \"sky\"? Except in a few cases, Might & Magic also has the drawback of most early CRPGs in which the game world doesn't react to your actions--nowhere is this more notable than the ending, in which you can \"reveal\" the false King Alamar over and over. Final score: 6.2. Character creation and development. Character creation is fairly basic in Might & Magic: you choose from a list of six classes and roll a standard selection of attributes. You can choose name, sex, and alignment. Character development, while still fairly basic, is surprisingly satisfying. In a standard game, you might achieve around 20 levels, and each level-up makes you palpably more powerful and able to handle the game's difficult battles. This is true of spell progression, of course, but also in the way that your fighters get extra attacks and do extra damage, and your robber has a better chance of disarming traps. Because of this, the experience rewards you get from quests and combat are quite satisfying. The game does introduce some \"role playing\" based on alignments, although it is very light (whether to release, torment, or ignore prisoners) and doesn't have lasting consequences. There is one area in which sex matters. Most encounters play identically no matter what the class, sex, or alignment. Final score: 5.3. NPC Interaction. The game is devoid of visible NPCs, but you come across them in certain squares, and your encounters with them are essential to advancing the game and learning about the game world. The game is one of the first to introduce choices in your NPC interactions--not dialog choices, unfortunately, but very basic ones such as whether to kiss, release, or ignore a maiden you find chained to a wall. A little better than The Bard's Tale (or, at least, more than The Bard's Tale) but not nearly as complex or satisfying as Ultima IV. Final score: 4Oddly, option (A) is the only way to advance the game. More oddly, all of my characters were female at this point. Jayne will be in his bunk.4. Encounters and foes. There are dozens of monsters in Might & Magic, almost all with a unique attack or two (sprites curse, centaurs put you to sleep, demon lords can eradicate your characters with a spell), almost all with special resistances, which makes encounters challenging as you try to figure out the best order in which to engage your enemies and the best weapons and spells to use. These foes are not well described, unfortunately, and most are standard fantasy game fare with the exception of some aliens. The game continues The Bard's Tale's tradition of throwing you up against wildly improbable groups of monsters in even more improbable settings: six green dragons and a herd of pegasuses in a cramped dungeon corridor, for instance. There are a few scripted encounters in which you have the option to do something other than fight, but it's almost always the poorer of the options and much of the game is hack & slash. I liked the way the game balanced fixed encounters with random ones. I also like how the game doesn't pull any punches. If you wander into the wrong map early in the game, your level 2 party gets fried by red dragons with no apologies. Areas re-spawn the moment you leave, allowing endless opportunities for experience-boosting. Final score: 6.Honestly, how did this party of foes ever come together?5. Magic and combat. Combat is fairly tactical, with a few nail-biting moments, especially at the beginning when opening every door is potentially deadly. The game is one of the first to include missile weapons, and the variety of items you can equip (see below) adds yet another layer to your options. The ability to immediately rest after most combat means that combats are individually tactical rather than tactical by accumulation as in Wizardry or The Bard's Tale. The first-person perspective doesn't offer a lot of opportunities for role-playing in combat. The magic system is well-balanced except at the end, when some of your spells become too powerful and you start to use them as crutches (by then, combat has become a bit boring anyway). Every level increase gives you something new to look forward to in combat, which is nice. Final score: 5.6. Equipment. In this area, Might & Magic is one of the best of the early CRPGs. You can wield up to six items and carry up to six more, and there are a wide variety of weapons, armor, accessories, rings, boots, and other items to don and use. These have increasing levels of magic power, including some that boost your statistics or cast spells. This may be the first game to require magical weapons to strike certain monsters, but I'm not sure. Some equipment I didn't understand: I held on to a set of rope & hooks and a 10-foot pole all the way to the end of the game, thinking they'd eventually be required, but they never were. I felt that even after around 50 hours of gameplay, I only had encountered a fraction of the possible equipment. Treasure is generally randomized within the game world, but there are a few special items that you receive after fixed battles or encounters. Although the items have no descriptions, and it's tough to tell the relative worth of weapons and armor except by selling cost, this is one of the best CRPGs of this era when it comes to variety and utility of gear. Final score: 7.Some of the varied types of equipment available in the game.7. Economy. Not complicated, but not bad for a 1980s CRPG. You start out with no gold, so you have to start making some fairly quickly. As you do, you're able to equip yourself slowly. As you progress through the towns, you find that more advanced equipment is available, so making money to buy things (and to train your characters) remains viable well into the 12th hour of the game. After that, well, there are still things to do with your money. Donating at temples will temporarily bestow upon you every protective spell in the game, at much higher levels than your characters can cast, so it's worth it to pay before a big battle. Second, the magic fountain at Dragadune converts all your gold to experience--meaning that if you make use of it, you need to immediately start building your finances again if you ever want to level up. Third, there's a place in the game where you can exchange gold for gems, through the intermediary of trivia questions. Thus, cash rewards never stop being relevant. Final score: 7.8. Quests. This is where Might & Magic really excels, particularly among its brethren of the Silver Age. As I remarked several times, the \"main quest\" reveals itself only in stages, which actually works well in a game that allows you open-ended exploration. The main quest is also unusual in its sci-fi theme and lack of a \"big boss.\" More important, however, there are dozens of side quests--the first real side quests in any CRPG, I think. Some of them are unusual and reasonably complex: climbing all the trees in a grove, solving the magic square puzzle, the mystery of Portsmith, and the prisoner-Statue of Judgment quest among them. They even offer a little light role-playing. Some involve finding items, some visiting locations, some killing monsters, some answering riddles. This is all extremely advanced for a CRPG of the era, and they remain fun even today, even if they don't offer the narrative complexity or role-playing choices of, say, Neverwinter Nights or Oblivion. Very well done, JVC. Final score: 8.Just picturing my characters doing this one is fun.9. Graphics, sound, inputs. The graphics of the era still have not advanced out of the \"functional\" stage. The game makes good use of sound, for the time, but to modern ears it's repetitive and ultimately annoying--I played most of the game with the sound off. Keyboard controls are easy enough to get used to. Final score: 4.10. Gameplay. As I previously covered, gameplay in Might & Magic is very non-linear, which (as I also previously covered), I like a lot. Except for a handful of locked doors for which you have to find the keys, there's almost nowhere in the game world that you can't trek from the starting town--assuming you can survive the monsters (hint: you can't). I liked that the game essentially required me to explore to even figure out what the main quest was about. The difficultly of the game is well-balanced. Although you die a lot, particularly at the beginning, the pace of the gameplay is fast enough that you don't really mind (assuming you haven't been a complete idiot about saving). Just as it starts to drag a bit, you start to get a selection of spells--time warp, fly, teleport, town portal--that make traveling about the world a bit faster, and low-level monsters much easier to dispatch. It was over just when I was about ready for it to be over, which is always the mark of a good game. My only complaint: no replayability. But that's par for the course in the Silver Age. In the end, this game was exactly what it should be to earn a high score on my blog: addictive. Final score: 8.The final tally of 60 is the highest of any CRPG so far, even higher than Ultima IV. This gives me a few pangs, but although I like Ultima IV better as a story, I admit that I probably like Might & Magic better as a game.As you'll see in my next posting, my next steps are not all that clear. More soon.Might & Magic ends with a shameless plug.Well, damn that took a long time, but in the wee hours of this morning, I completed Might & Magic: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum, easily the largest and, hence, longest game I have played in my blogging project so far. In fact, I think it's safe to say that it rivals modern games in its overall number of game hours.My last hours in the game were marked by stupid mistakes and laughable errors, starting with the revelation--after I had won the game--that I had missed the graphics setup executable in the game folder. Instead of seeing this for the past 50 hours of gameplay......I could have been seeing this:Oh, well, the important part is the gameplay, right? We'll get to that.When I last blogged, I was working to fill in pieces of each map and stop dying all the time. This was helped greatly as my spellcasters advanced and got hold of the more powerful spells, some of which could completely obliterate large groups of enemies in one casting. I was able to finish most of the surface and all but a few of the underground maps at this point. I solved two of the more important side quests, one of which involved slaying four big bads in each corner of the map and then spinning a wheel of fortune to get gold, gems, and experience as a reward. The second involved visiting each of the castles in the game world and determining what to do with prisoners found there. This quest was kicked off by a wizard named Ranalou who I met in a cave:The quest offered some real (if basic) role-playing choices that had to jive with your alignment. Among the prisoners you found were scared children, helpless maidens, and vicious demons. I had to decide what to do with each one and then head to the \"Statue of Judgment\" after dealing with all of them. Good characters were rewarded if they tormented the demon but set the other prisoners free. Evil characters were rewarded for tormenting everyone. Neutral characters were rewarded for walking away from each prisoner. Since my party had a mixture of good, neutral, and evil characters, no one got the full reward. If I were to play again, I would stock my party with characters of a single alignment.As I covered in another recent posting, sex turned out to play a role. In one town--Portsmith--male characters were drained of hit points every time they walked through certain (unavoidable) intersections. This turned out to be the work of a succubus holed up in a secret room, and in due course I was able to find and kill her and her minions. But to even stand a chance, I used a magic pool in the town's dungeons to change the sexes of all of my male characters so they wouldn't be drained before the big battle. Then, in horrible show of non role-playing, I never got around to changing them back. \"Redbeard\" the dwarf fighter, and all of his compatriots, ended the game as females.I spent a lot of time fighting my way through the four levels dungeon of Dragadune to find the enigmatic \"Clerics of the South,\" who rewarded me with this message:I had absolutely no idea what this meant, and I was a little annoyed at having worked so hard for it. Only after winning the game and checking a walkthrough did I find that this meant I could return to various spots that boosted my stats and get them boosted again, as well as complete the Statue of Judgment quest again. Oh, well.In the Castle of Doom, after battling my way through hordes of tough monsters, I found this message scrawled on a wall:I remember the Star Trek episode of the same title, and at first I thought this was just a geeky reference to it (the M&M team is well known for its frequent Star Trek references, including \"Q\" in VI). But it turned out to be an important plot point in the game, as we'll soon see.In the corner of another map, in an area accessible only through the use of the \"etherealize\" spell, which allows the party to pass through walls, I found a \"Land of the Lost\" in which dinosaurs roamed.Battling through them, I found an \"Hourglass of Time,\" which reverted all my characters to the age of 18. Many of them had been pushing 50 by then, which means that in game time, my party had been adventuring together for 32 years. That's quite a quest.My dungeon explorations allowed me to assemble the two strange \"messages\" that you find in pieces around the world. The first was singularly unhelpful, only telling me where the various fountains and pools and other sites were that raise each of your stats by 4 points each. I had already found them all by the time I figured out the message. The other one spelled out the game:THE SCOOP: FOR SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF BOOK ONE, THESE ARE THE TASKS THAT MUST BE DONE. RIDDLES AND QUESTS, DISCOVERIES AND TRAINING, EACH HAS A VALUE THAT INCREASES YOUR RATING. THE KING'S TRUE SELF YOU MUST IDENTIFY, TO BE WORTHY OF THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU CAN APPLY. RETURN FROM THE ASTRAL PLANE FROM 5 DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, THE 6TH VISIT WITH A KEY CARD SHALL END YOUR FRUSTRATIONS! YET 9th LEVEL YOU MUST HAVE ATTAINED FOR THE INNER SANCTUM TO BE CLAIMED. FROM MY DREAMS TO REALITY, AND REALITY TO DREAMS, A SEQUEL IS IN ORDER, WONDROUS IT SEEMS... JVCA little helpful, I guess, but nothing I wouldn't have figured out on my own. \"JVC\" is the creator, Jon Van Caneghem, who I think is still in the business. Jon, if a little ego-surfing leads you to this blog, you made a hell of a game.The toughest quest leading up to the endgame concerned the blind seer Og. One of the first clues I got in the game, from a statue in Sorpigal, was that I needed to restore his sight with two idols, and this was somehow connected to a black and white checkboard pattern I kept finding in dungeons. Well, I did find the pattern a lot, and in two of the locations, searching yielded the necessary idols. I took them to Og and got this...Now, if I'm not mistaken, this is another Star Trek reference--specifically to the unexplained three-dimensional chess that they sometimes play in the original series. At least, it's the only way I can explain \"levels.\" To solve this, I first thought, the creators wanted me to know the rules of 3-D chess from Star Trek? Jesus.Then I remembered three clues I had received in other black and white checkboard rooms. They were:The first part is femaleThe second part is most valuableThe last part is the firstHelpful, right? Friends, I came awfully close to breaking my \"no spoilers\" rule. The first clue was easy enough: \"Queen.\" The other two, I just couldn't figure out, mostly because I was thinking that 3D chess might have all kinds of esoteric moves. Answers I'm embarrassed to say that I tried include \"QUEEN TO GOLD QUEEN\" and \"QUEEN TO DIAMOND QUEEN LEVEL\" or some such nonsense. Ultimately, I realized the answer would have to parallel the challenge, with the name of a piece, the name of another piece's \"level,\" and the number of the level. The \"most valuable\" piece is a king and could \"the first\" refer to something as absurdly simple as....yes, the answer was \"QUEEN TO KING'S LEVEL 1.\" After all that, this is what I got:Great, right? Except that I had already found the prisoner in Doom! So all that was just for the 25,000 experience points, which by this point in the game I was getting in three or four battles with dragons. Bloody hell.Here was the aforementioned prisoner:This dovetailed nicely with what the crashed aliens had told me earlier in the game, so with the Eye of Goros, I went off to challenge the fake Alamar.Alamar revealed himself as the alien \"demon\" and threw me into a dungeon called the Soul Maze, where I was immediately confronted with this question:Now, folks, if I was embarrassed at how long it took me to solve Og's riddle, this one really fills me with shame. I spent hours mapping the dungeon making sure that I turned and faced each wall. To my frustration, I couldn't find any messages written anywhere that told me my captor's name. I must have gone through it three or four times before I finally took a good look at the map I had been making:I mean, could that be any easier to see? MY NAME IS SHELTEM (I don't know what to make of the enigmatic \"HELP\" in the upper left). Anyway, I gave the answer, and here's when things got weird:Okay...well, I had a pretty good idea where the Inner Sanctum was: on the Astral Plane, which I had the foresight to have already visited and mapped. Somewhere along the line--I missed to tell ye in my tale--I found the key card I needed to get into the place, and so without further ado, I made my way.So it turns out that the game world, called Varn, was actually VARN (Vehicular Astropod Research Nacelle)--a space ship. An alien invader named Sheltem crashed on the ship and impersonated a king. And all the monsters and undead and magic were...what?....aspects of the same technology that powers the ship? Things get weird when you combine fantasy with sci-fi. The references to Corak are never explained, and it remains unclear what happened to Sheltem. Quite oddly, there is no final battle. I expected an epic confrontation with Sheltem that never came: if you re-visit Alamar's/Sheltem's castle, you just get tossed into the  Soul Maze again.The game allows you to keep playing and finish any side quests. There are 37 according to one walkthrough, and I think through my exhaustive mapping of the game world, I was able to complete them all.I made a video of the end game (it starts with me killing some dragons just because I can and is interrupted a couple of times while I take screen shots) if you're interested. Otherwise, it's time for my review posting and then on to...The Bard's Tale II. Bollocks."}, {"title": "Might & Magic & Quests", "date": "Friday, July 16, 2010", "text": "The adventurers get a quest that truly tests their ingenuity.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I've been waiting for Might & Magic to settle in to a more cohesive narrative before I posted again, but that just isn't happening. The game is, rather, coming together like a puzzle, and until I get more pieces I won't be able to see the full picture.After I found the Merchant's Pass, I was able to visit a couple of the castles and get quests. It appears that each lord gives a series of quests, starting with very easy ones (\"bring me garlic!\" or visit a particular location) and escalating to hard ones. My current quest is to find a medusa's head. I have a pretty good idea where to look, but gorgons and basilisks keep turning me to stone, and I won't have \"stone to flesh\" for another level yet. Fortunately, whenever I encounter obstacles like this, there's another map to explore.In my first Might & Magic posting, I thought there might be around 35 maps to explore. Ha! I didn't account for all the dungeons, caves, castles, and fortresses--some with multiple levels. I'm up to 53 now, and I think it might be finally slowing down. Still making very little progress on the \"main quest,\" but I'll let you know when that changes.The game got a little easier when I reached Level 4 and got two spells: \"time warp,\" which allows you to escape combat, and \"surface,\" which allows you to quickly exit a dungeon. These coupled with \"fly\" mean that I'm never more than a few moves from a town, healing, and a save point. But you can't always rely on them. \"Time warp\" has a way of failing right when you need it most, and I still get wiped out in about 25% of my forays from town.A few other random things from the game.1. Black & white checkerboard rooms. I keep finding rooms like this one in dungeons:A statue in Sorpigal suggests these have something to do with the seer Og (who I found on one of the maps but couldn't do anything with), but I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with them. (S)earching returns nothing and there are no secret doors.2. Magic square puzzle. One of the dungeons had this neat soduku-ish game where the entire dungeon was laid out in a 4 x 4 grid. The center of each room had a dial that you could set to a number from 1-9. Some of them were already pre-set to numbers higher than 9. I figured out right away that it was a magic square in which all of the rows and columns needed to add up to the same number (34) and you could only use each number once. With a little help from Excel, I figured it out and was duly rewarded. I can't remember this type of puzzle in a CRPG earlier than this one.3. Messages. One of the consistent features of Might & Magic is that you encounter a series of nonsense messages at various places in the game (in VI and VII they're on obelisks scattered throughout the land; in I they're written on walls). Once you've found all the messages, you interleave the letters or words to determine the total narrative. I've only found a few, so I can't even begin to guess. There seem to be two sets--one with letters and one with entire words.4. Corak. In one dungeon, I found this message scrawled on a wall. It is the first reference to the enigmatic Corak, who appears in a bunch of the Might & Magic games, but frankly I forget what his specific role is. I just remember him--or references to him--in III. Maybe this game will remind me.5. A dungeon with invisible walls. I stumbled into this one from a magic door. The \"locate\" spell didn't work and you couldn't see most of the walls--you could only try to walk into them and get a \"blocked!\" message. This was a pain to map. I'm still not sure what I'm supposed to do there--I apparently need some kind of card.6. The experience fountain. In a ruined castle called Dragadune, I found this fountain, which takes your gold and gives you an equivalent number of experience points. I thought this was unique to Might & Magic VI. Now I'm wondering if all Might & Magic games have one and I've just forgotten--or missed them.6. Little touches. Wandering through the fortress of the minotaur lord, you come across things like this. Yes, it would be nice if the game actually showed you these tapestries, but we're a few years away from those graphical capabilities. It's still a neat touch that keeps the game interesting.My basic strategy has been to explore each map until I get blocked--either because I need an item I don't have or because the monsters get too hard--and then move on to the next map, revisiting the previous ones at higher levels. As much as I enjoy the game, I'm getting ready for it to end--my long list awaits--but I actually want to find out what the main quest is, who Corak is, and the fate of the alien invader. To me, that's a sign of a good CRPG."}, {"title": "Might & Magic & Adventure", "date": "Tuesday, July 13, 2010", "text": "I do like riddles in CRPGs, even if this one was pretty damned obvious.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You will be pleased to know that I've been living up to my name. I happen to be working on my PhD right now. I should be done with my coursework in February, provided I don't flunk out of the program before then. Yesterday, I had two papers due, but I put them off until today--turning them in a day late--because I spent most of yesterday playing Might & Magic. How far I've come since high school!Usually when I don't post anything for a few days it's because I'm traveling or working and trying my best not to think about CRPGs. Lately, it's been for a different reason: I've been playing. Over the weekend, I didn't want to tear myself away from my gaming to blog about it. I have essentially the same problem with vodka.As I mentioned towards the end of my last posting, I was dissatisfied with the combat performance of my spellcasters, largely because I hadn't taken into consideration the effects of speed on combat initiative. I rolled a new sorcerer and new cleric and spent much of my playing time getting them up to speed while still exploring. I've mapped at least some of all of the 20 outdoor areas, although almost all of those maps have notes for things I have to come back and do when I'm at a higher level or have found some key or something.I'm also finally getting hints about the main quest--I think. Actually, a few things happened and I'm not sure which are related to the main quest. Here are my options:Main Quest Possibility 1: Something to Do with a Minotaur KingI found clues in two towns directing me to a particular map square where I found a whistle that will allow me entry to the minotaur lord's enchanted lair. Part of me thinks this is the main quest because the hints came from two brothers I was told to seek by the wizard who finished off the first quest in the game. Also there was a statue in the first town that talked about the minotaur lord's castle in the Enchanted Forest. The strength of this possibility is that it appeared early in the game, which main quests usually do.Main Quest Possibility 2: AliensOn another map square, I met \"the exiled Lord Kilburn\" who gave me a map that prevented me from getting hopelessly lost in the desert.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It took me forever to explore the desert anyway because it's full of teleporters that randomly pop you around the map, and even if you don't get lost, walking through the desert consumes a unit of food for every step. Nonetheless, I finally found a circle of mountains in the middle of which was...wait for it...an alien spacecraft.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The game gave me a role-playing choice and I decided to be friendly. Suddenly, the alien spoke English:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now, any player of any other Might & Magic game knows that the M&M series has a way of diverging suddenly into science fiction. In Might & Magic III, the final dungeon is a spacecraft. Might & Magics IV and V have a sci-fi game ending that I won't spoil here. Might & Magics VI and VII have you battling alien invaders. There is a basic sci-fi mythology to the whole series, and I wondered if it would appear in the first game. I'm glad to see it does; maybe it will solve some of my confusion on the rest of the series. So the sci-fi element makes this very likely to be the main quest, but I can't be fully sure.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Main Quest Possibility 3: It Hasn't Started Yet\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Main quests are often introduced by lords and kings, but I have yet to be able to speak to any of them. Why? Every time I go into a castle, I get booted out because I don't have a merchant's pass. It turns out there was one very easy to find early in the game but I overlooked it. Now that I have one, I can start speaking to kings and queens, see if they tell me anything useful, and perhaps expose the alien impostor besides.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Not having any idea about the main quest this late in the game is a bit unusual, but in Might & Magic, you get so easily distracted by side quests and other encounters. I've lost track of all the fun things I've encountered just wandering around the maps. Here's a quick sample:A gypsy who reads my characters and tells me their signs. On another map, accurate knowledge of these signs compels a bridge guardian to extend a magical bridge across the ocean to a hidden area; getting the signs wrong destroys your characters(!)A throne adorned with gems. A mysterious voice poses a riddle whose answer is \"love.\" The correct answer provides the characters with a diamond key (don't know what it opens yet).Very powerful creatures, including a black knight and a sea dragon. I know from a statue in Sorpigal that if I kill them, I'll get rewarded at the Wheel of Fortune (which I found), but I'm a long way from being a high enough level to do that.A mountain peak whose views give you hints as to encounters on other maps.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A town (Portsmith) in which every resident is a woman and male characters are continually drained of their hit points, making combat nearly impossible.A cave full of teleporters, the successful navigation of which puts you in touch with a wizard named Ranalou who gives you access to a bunch of portals to other places.Fountains that temporarily raise your statistics.A grove of trees.  You apparently get some reward for climbing each one, but climbing them leads to encounters and I haven't survived yet.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 A statue of a lion asking for a password.A statue with a \"scroll of judgment.\" Haven't figured out what to do there yet.A forest in which mysterious weeping echoes throughout.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 And finally, several notes to round out my previous discussion of combat in Might & Magic.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Might & Magic continues The Bard's Tale tradition of throwing at you rosters of monsters that seem implausible as coordinated groups. Three clerics, six vampire bats, and a acidic slug. A minor demon, three militiamen, and four swarms of bees. How do you plan an attack with a swarm of bees? Why do you?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There's a handy keyboard shortcut, CTRL-A, that makes you cycle through combat very quickly. Each character in melee range attacks, each one with a missile weapon shoots, and other characters just guard. Very handy for low-level monsters.Donating at temples causes the priests to bless you with a battery of protection spells until you rest. You could cast each one individually, but they take time.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Attacking certain creatures (unicorns, pegasuses, clerics, etc.) causes your alignment to slip. Good characters become neutral and neutral characters become evil. You have to pay to right things. This is particularly annoying because there's no \"talk\" option, so if you want to avoid attacking a group of creatures, you have to try to flee.Flee almost never works. Especially when you need it most.Even when wandering low-level areas with high-level characters, you can never get too cocky. Centaurs and sprites, for instance, are both easy to deal with singly, but run into a pack of them and they will repeatedly cast sleep or curse (respectively), destroying your chances of fighting back. One unlucky random encounter can ruin hours of work if you don't keep going back to a town and saving (which has the unfortunate drawback of resetting the map).I am still dying at the same rate as before: for every 30 minutes of gameplay only about 10 is \"saved.\" This isn't as bad as it sounds because most of that time is spent mapping, and once that's done, it's done whether your characters survived or not.I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but the \"turn undead\" spell, even on the basest of creatures, works about 1 time in 20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Still having a great time, though.

No question about finishing this one."}, {"title": "Might and Magic and Ability Scores", "date": "Friday, July 9, 2010", "text": "Grey Star the Sorcerer: weak, slow, and clumsy, but lucky and smart\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Might and Magic is the first game in which I'm really noticing the affects of ability scores. Every game up until now has had them, but I didn't really think about them once the game started. Here, their effects are front-and-center.Ability scores, attributes, characteristics--whatever you call them--are an element that almost all CRPGs share. In this, of course, they are adapting rules from pen-and-paper Dungeons & Dragons. The earliest games had only one or two scores. Rogue, I think, just had strength. But fairly quickly--by Ultima I, really--games had grown into the standard set of five or six ability scores. It's rare to find a game (like Ultima IV, which only had strength, dexterity, and intelligence) that reverts to fewer.I'm always amused by the numerous ways different games try to be original by changing the names of the ability scores. The standard D&D list is strength, dexterity, intelligence, wisdom, charisma, and constitution. Perhaps in an effort to avoid copyright violations, Wizardry offered a slightly different but nearly synonymous list: strength, IQ, piety, vitality, agility, and luck. \"Charisma\" was presumably left off the list because in early CRPGs, there were few ways to actually base anything on it. \"Luck\" is an innovation for Wizardry--an extra score that has subtle influences on just about everything--and it would carry over into other first-person, multi-party games like The Bard's Tale and Might and Magic.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Wizardry's character screen with ability scores.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Might and Magic's contributions, such as they are, to the evolution of ability scores is to use \"might\" instead of strength, split dexterity into \"accuracy\" and \"speed,\" and combine wisdom and charisma into \"personality,\" the prime stat for clerics (in this they anticipate the third edition D&D rules). Like D&D games, each character class has minimum levels of attributes.Although the names change, the purpose of different ability scores remains fairly consistent. In descending order of prevalence, we find:Something that determines how much damage the character does when he hits something. This is almost always called \"strength\" but of course is \"might\" in Might and Magic (otherwise, it would have to be Strength & Spells). Secondary uses of this attribute in some games include determining what type of weapon one can wield (Phantasie), how much weight the character can carry (Elder Scrolls) and whether the character can force doors or chests (D&D-derived games).Something that determines the character's spell power. Usually this is \"intelligence\" but it also goes by \"IQ.\" Like strength, it has secondary uses in more advanced CRPGs. In D&D games, for instance, it helps determine whether you can translate  scrolls and identify magic items. In Baldur's Gate II, Neverwinter Nights, and Icewind Dale II, it also determines the sophistication of your dialog responses.Something that determines how likely a character's attack is to connect. \"Dexterity\" is the D&D term, but we also have \"agility,\" \"accuracy,\" and \"aim.\" I can't think of secondary uses for this one, but see below.Something that determines how fast the character moves and, hence, how likely he is to be hit. In D&D, this is also \"dexterity,\" but some games, including the Might & Magic and Elder Scrolls series, split it off into a separate \"speed\" score. In continuously-scrolling games (like all games are after the mid-1990s), this score may literally determine how quickly you move across the screen. Some of my fondest times in Oblivion is when my speed-enhanced character rushes up and down mountainsides, blasts through forests, and leaps across rivers. In turn-based games like Might & Magic, speed determines the attack order of characters and enemies (more on this in the last paragraph).Something that determines how much damage you can take. Usually, hit points are a \"derived\" statistic based on your level and an ability score. In D&D, that ability score is called \"constitution,\" but we also have \"endurance,\" \"vitality,\" and \"stamina\" in the repertoire. As games get more advanced, this statistic also determines how likely you are to succumb to certain spell effects and how much liquor you can hold.Something that determines how charming you are. \"Charisma\" or \"personality,\" generally. This has a bunch of different uses depending on the game, including spell power for clerics or priests, prices at shops, and relations with NPCs. In the Baldur's Gate series, it determines how easy or difficult it is for the PC to hold together a party of differing alignments, and it determines who the PC can romance.A secondary characteristic for priest spells. In games that separate cleric/priest spells from wizard/sorcerer spells, \"wisdom\" or \"piety\" or \"personality\" will determine the power of those spells and how many the character can cast. Except when combined with the above attribute, this doesn't seem to have many secondary uses.Do you feel lucky? Finally, as we've seen, Wizardry and its posterity introduced a \"luck\" statistic just to shake things up.Setting ability scores in Ultima I.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CRPGs offer a lot of variety as to how these statistics are determined. Some automatically generate them and you take what you get. Some allow you to \"re-roll\" until you get the outcome you want. Some give you a fixed score pool and allow you to allocate the numbers the way you want. A few (Pool of Radiance and Temple of Apshai come to mind) allow you just to specify the attributes you want, which offers a usually-insurmountable temptation to just max everything. Perhaps the most unique attribute-setting method was found in Alternate Reality: the City, in which a constantly-spinning series of dials fixed in place the moment you walked through a portal.\"Hold it...hold it...Now! No, wait!...Okay, now!\"\u00a0Perhaps one of the most variable aspects of CRPG playing is how mutable these statistics are once fixed. In D&D games, it practically requires an act of the gods to change your ability scores, and even then you can only change them by a little bit. This makes sense in the context of the D&D worlds, in which there is a theoretically upper limit for any human, no matter how heroic. In later Might & Magic games, by contrast, it hardly matters what statistics you have at the outset because your final characters will have many many times that initial number. I remember starting out Might & Magic VI with 15 or 16 strength and--thanks to potions, wells, barrels of colored liquid, magic items, and other fortunate finds--ending up with almost 300.Oh, let's quickly cover a few other aspects of ability scores worth thinking about:They can be damaged. Spells, poisons, curses, and other assorted calamities can give you the strength of an infant and the intelligence of Glenn Beck.They can be enhanced. Other spells, potions, and magic items can elevate your stats. I particularly like finding Gauntlets of Ogre Strength in D&D games and immediately transmuting a character with a strength of 6 to one with strength of 18 (the third edition ruined this).They are modified by race and sex.  If the game allows multiple races, very often you'll find yourself with  higher strength (dwarves), lower charisma (half-orcs), or some other  adjustment after finishing your character.Each character class usually has a \"prime requisite.\" Strength for fighters, dexterity for thieves, and so on. There is usually a minimum acceptable ability score for those classes. In some games, you choose the class first and the ability scores get adjusted; in others you get your scores first and have to choose from a limited selection of classes based on the results.With a charisma of 6 and an intelligence of 4, I could only choose between the \"Fox News Commentator\" and \"Galoot\" classes.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Bringing this back to Might and Magic, as I said, I'm feeling the results of my initial ability score selection choices. I did well enough with might for my two fighting classes, and when their swords connect, they connect with a satisfyingly-high amount of damage. I did well with accuracy on my archer, too (19)--she lands every shot she makes. But I skimped on speed except for my robber (16). The result is that he almost always attacks first, but with an accuracy of 13 he often misses, and with a might of 8 he hardly ever does any damage.What you really want, I'm discovering, is a sorcerer with a high speed score, so he can immediately blast groups of enemies at the opening of the battle. Conversely, you want a cleric with a low speed score, so she can go last in the rotation and heal any major damage taken by party members in that round, getting them back on their feet for the next round. This is important enough that I'm considering ditching my existing cleric and sorcerer and re-creating ones with better (or, in the case of the cleric, worse) scores.Other than that, I'm still exploring and mapping, and collecting screen shots for a post later about the different things you encounter in the Might & Magic world."}, {"title": "Linearity in CRPGs", "date": "Tuesday, July 6, 2010", "text": "Am I safe in saying that nobody likes linearity in a CRPG? Non-linearity, or the illusion thereof, is one of the features that separates CRPGs from other types of games. The idea that you can just wander out from your starting point and explore the world, blundering your way into impossible encounters at low levels, doing quests in any order you choose, running right to the endgame if you know where it is, backtracking...it's intoxicating. The more I think about it, the more I realize that the games I cherish most are inevitably nonlinear.In this facet, CRPGs stand in stark contrast with, say, first-person shooters. Imagine a Half Life 2 where there aren't so many mysteriously locked doors (couldn't possibly open any of those with my shotgun, rocket launcher, or grenades, could I?) and in which you could wander off the train, grab a crowbar from some shack along the tracks, start beating Combine soldiers, and head out the city's front gates. I might want to play it again. Even the classic \"adventure\" game tends to be fairly linear, forcing you to do things in an exact sequence to find the box that contains the key that opens the gate that releases the unicorn that attracts the virgin that gives you a kiss that etc. etc. etc. Each game in the King's Quest series is like a huge Rube Goldberg machine.\"It's impervious to crowbars, pistols,  shotguns, grenades, rocket launchers, submachine guns, pulse guns, and  gravity guns...a true revolution in home security!\"But fire up Morrowind, for instance, and you can jump off the ship, make a quick stop in the Census & Excise Office, and head literally anywhere in the huge game world. (There isn't even a single locked door that requires a key, unlike Oblivion.) You can just explore and never initiate the main quest, or you can make a beeline directly for Dagoth Ur's fortress beyond the Ghost Fence. Assuming you can survive--hard but not impossible--you can gather the tools you need to defeat the god and win the game in less than half an hour. This guy did it in 7:30, and most of that was waiting until the introductory characters stopped blathering:Morrowind stands as the most nonlinear game I have ever played, largely because it is set on an island, so there are no artificial boundaries to progressing around the world. But really all the Elder Scrolls games share this feature. It is one of the most compelling elements of the series and more than makes up for their occasional flaws.Other wonderfully nonlinear games include:The Might & Magic series. I remember IV-VIII well enough to know that you can pretty much go anywhere in the game world after the introduction. I'm discovering the same is true of I as well, but I don't know about II or III yet. Sigh...I suppose I'll have to acknowledge there was a IX at some point, but...just not yet, okay?Ultimas IV-VII Part I. You have the entire game world to explore and can visit the towns, and talk to the denizens, in any order.Baldur's Gate. Once the episode with Gorion is over, you can stalk off in any direction and have a number of fun encounters unrelated to the main quest. The main quest itself, with its \"chapter\" division, does introduce some linearity, but you have a lot of freedom even here. Baldur's Gate II is a little more linear because its game map doesn't have mysterious areas into which you can just wander--you have to be told about them first--but the game does give you a lot of freedom in quest order and how soon or late to move between chapters.Although I typically follow the same pattern every time, I theoretically could do this in any order I want.The issue of linearity helps explain why some games are simply less fun to play even when they use the same game engine, game world, or game play. The Bard's Tale I and II, whose interfaces are nearly indistinguishable from Might & Magic, are a lot less fun because they force you to progress through the dungeons in a specific order. There is no sense of exploration. I enjoyed Ultima VII Part II much less than Part I for the same reason. The Icewind Dale series uses the same game engine as Baldur's Gate but is far less compelling because you're forced to move methodically from one chapter to another. The first time I played Neverwinter Nights, I left some quests undone in Chapter 1, assuming I could wander back to Neverwinter from Port Llast in Chapter 3. I was very disappointed to find out I was wrong--and for the dumbest of reasons. I'm blocked by trees! That's worse than Half Life's shotgun-proof door locks.The worst CRPGs are completely linear, railroading you through a series of maps and steadfastly refusing to allow you to backtrack. I'm talking about you, Dungeon Siege, and you, Jade Empire, and unfortunately you, Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal. At least Neverwinter Nights allows  you to explore each chapter's areas in whatever order you want.What makes non-linearity so fun? I would suggest there are five main  reasons:1. The feeling that you're playing  your own game. If you thoroughly shuffle a deck of 52 playing  cards, chances  are overwhelming that that particular arrangement of cards has  never existed before. I like the same feeling in a CRPG: that the game  I'm playing has never been played by another player. No other player has  ever exited the Oblivion dungeon,  headed back to the prison to try to turn himself in and, finding no  recourse to do that, punched the guard on duty so he could be arrested  and finish serving his sentence. But I did, last time I played.2. Honest-to-God role playing.  Why did I do that sequence last time I played Oblivion? I decided my character was going to be an  ex-guard himself, committed to the principles of law and order, who had  made a bad decision and was suffering horrible guilt for it. In that  game, you can invent such complex characters and role-play them  accordingly. In Baldur's Gate you  can (at least for a time) decide you always hated Gorion and head off  in a random direction looking for gold. Or you can develop a  pathological hatred for bandits and spend hours patrolling the Sword  Coast collecting their scalps. Ultimately you have to capitulate to the  main quest if you want to \"win,\" but non-linearity allows you to do it  the way you want to do it.3. Backtracking. Ever visit  your old High School and walk its corridors, using the experience to  gauge how much you've changed since then? You get some of the same  feeling wandering the streets of New Sorpigal (in Might & Magic VI) after clearing  out a map full of dragons. Remember how the goblins in Goblinwatch gave  you such trouble when you were level 1? Well, they've re-spawned since  then. I love taking my level 30 characters into some dungeon on the  first map and committing nonstop slaughter of my erstwhile archnemeses.Hmmm...bridge trolls. Let me introduce you to a little thing I like to call a \"Kill\" spell.4. The joy of exploration. Most nonlinear games--though not all--seed their expansive gameworlds with interesting things to find and do, including plenty of side quests. Baldur's Gate has a village of Xvarts for no other reason except that you stumble upon them and have to decide whether to slaughter them or flee. In another map, you're wandering along through the forest and see a statue of a fighter in the middle of nowhere. Just as you realize \"hey, that's not a statue!\" here comes a basilisk. That's CRPG gold.\"In retrospect, we should have seen this coming.\"5. Replayability. This reason builds on the other four, but it's still worth mentioning. There would be no reason to replay The Bard's Tale unless enough time had passed that you simply forgot it. By allowing you freedom of movement, however, and the attendant role-playing and exploration that come with it, you could replay some games dozens of times and create new experiences each time. The funny thing is, I sometimes don't capitalize on this advantage: I often struggle to keep myself from playing a game the same way I've already played it.Non-linearity, of course, has to be coupled with a game world worth exploring. I suppose that, technically speaking, Akalabeth is fairly nonlinear, but its effect is muted since you can't really go anywhere. Ditto Wizardry, Ultima I, Ultima II, Wizardry II, and so on.In last night's posting, I said that Might & Magic I was one of the most nonlinear games I've ever played. I suppose I should have said it was one of the most nonlinear that also had a large game world. In that sense, it certainly takes the prize as the first CRPG to allow completely open-ended exploration, including not telling you anything about your main quest! (I am assured there is one by readers.) This solves my mystery of why I love the game in a way that I didn't with the identically-interfaced The Bard's Tale II.What are some very linear or very nonlinear CRPGs that I neglected to discuss here?Supplement on 07/12/2010BuckGB at GameBanshee posted a link to this article today and defended some of the linear games I mentioned, as did some of the comments. I admit I misspoke a bit when I said \"the worst CRPGs are completely linear\" and then proceeded to name Dungeon Siege, Jade Empire, and Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal as examples. Dungeon Siege I don't apologize for, but never would I try to defend my inclusion of Jade Empire and Throne of Bhaal on a list of \"the worst\" CRPGs. As it happens, I enjoyed both games immensely despite their linearity. They both offer excellent dialog and superior role-playing choices.Thus, I probably overemphasized this aspect a bit. But generally speaking, I think that if two games are equal in other respects, the nonlinear one is the better of the two. Might & Magic beats The Bard's Tale. Pool of Radiance beats Champions of Krynn. Shadows of Amn beats Throne of Bhaal. Ultima VII Part I beats Ultima VII Part II. This is only in my opinion, of course, but then again it's my blog.The GameBanshee post, along with comments on another site, do answer the question with which I started this posting: \"Am I safe in saying that nobody likes linearity in a CRPG?\" The answer is no, I'm not safe; many people like linearity in CRPGs. I don't get them, but they exist."}, {"title": "Might & Magic I: Extreme Freedom, Extreme Danger", "date": "Sunday, July 4, 2010", "text": "After several hours of playing, if I blink at a white wall, I see this image.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yesterday evening, after exploring Sorpigal and its dungeon, I thought Might & Magic was a little bit difficult. Oh, how I would love to have those innocent, carefree days back again.The problem isn't so much that the game is universally \"hard\" so much as that, starting out, you have no guidance as to your main quest and you can literally go anywhere. This is one of the most non-linear games I've ever played. Unfortunately, the different maps don't offer predictable levels of difficulty, so it's extremely common to blunder into monsters well outside your class.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When I get to be level 30, I am so going to come back and kick your ass.Let me back up a little. Last night, I had decided to explore the towns before trying the outdoor areas. This worked for the second town, Erliquin. I delivered the scroll to the wizard Agar, who gave me a nice reward. He sent me on to another wizard in the next town, so after mapping Erliquin and part of its dungeon (access to the rest of the dungeon required a code word that I haven't found yet), I moved on to the city of Dusk. I delivered the scroll no problem and got a hint about some brothers in the last two towns.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think this is the first  quest-based experience reward in a CRPG.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But I couldn't finish mapping Dusk. One of the sections led me to increasingly difficult encounters with undead, and after dying half a dozen times, I gave it up for later. I moved on to Portsmith where I was slaughtered immediately and mercilessly. The town features hot spots that drain hit points from all male party members, the sexist bastards.So my plan to explore all the towns first went out the window, and I decided to venture outside. \"Outside\" in Might & Magic is basically the same thing as \"inside\" but with different textures and more open areas. There are \"walls\" of forests and mountains, and \"secret doors\" that go through them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A forest opening upon a desert.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I mapped the area around Sorpigal--map square C2--without much problem. After that, however, my characters began dying with alarming frequency. There are some map squares that just have impossibly high-level monsters, like the red dragon above. Then there are other maps that are generally easy but occasionally throw a random encounter at you that destroys you. Some of the creatures that the game treats as \"low level\" are actually horrifically deadly. My current most hated nemeses are:Killer bees and locust swarms: Both of these monsters have a \"swarm\" attack that damage all of your characters. If any of your characters are unconscious when they initiate the special attack, they will die.Acid blobs: Essentially the same problem as above, but they spray acid.Minor devils: I keep getting hit with packs of 10 of them, and they overwhelm my party with energy blasts.Troglodytes: Spray poison and I don't have cure poison yet.Sprites: Cast \"curse\" over and over making them impossible to hit.The upshot of the game's difficulty is that for every 30 minutes I play, only 10 minutes are \"saved\"--meaning 20 of those 30 minutes are wasted when I die. It's not as bad as it sounds because I'm getting a lot of mapping done, but the repetition has become almost comical: venture forth to a new map area, map 10 squares, die in combat, re-load, venture forth, map 10 more squares, die in combat, re-load, venture forth, map 10 more squares and win one combat, hustle back to the inn to save, repeat from step 1.My basic approach has been to hit each of the 20 map areas one by one, mapping as much as I can, and saving after every few successful battles. If I die three times in any one map area, I move on to the next one, saving a return to the previous one for a higher level. Two spells have made exploration a lot easier: \"fly,\" which allows you to quickly go to any map area (and back to an area that has a town), and \"water walk,\" which allows you to explore the oceans and lakes.As I predicted in my last posting, this game is about the difficulty of individual battles. There are a few places where you can't rest, but they're rare. For the most part, if you can stay alive through a battle, you can rest, heal, recharge your spell points, and be ready for the next one fresh. This is in stark contrast to Wizardry, where there was no resting and the tactical difficulty came in the accumulation of battles. In Might & Magic, there's no particular reason to hold back on your most powerful spells whereas in Wizardry you tried to conserve them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Might & Magic battle screen.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Might & Magic introduces a few features to combat that make it more interesting than other games of the genre. The basic things you need to know are:When you choose a command for a character, it is executed immediately, not \"stacked\" the way it is in Wizardry, The Bard's Tale, and Phantasie.Your characters, and the monsters, attack in the order of their speed attributes. If I'd known this, I might have spent more time on the character creation screens.\"(S)hoot\" is a command that appears in this game for the first time, allowing characters not engaged in melee combat to fire a bow, sling or crossbow. Archers can do this even if they are engaged in melee combat, and I find that my archer's shot is always more deadly than her regular attack.\"(F)ight\" allows you to attack any enemy in melee range. This allows you to concentrate attacks on spellcasters or other foes you want to dispatch quickly.Characters and creatures with a \"+\" next to them are in melee combat. The neat thing is, the number and arrangement depend on the terrain. In a narrow dungeon corridor, for instance, only the two front characters will be in melee range, whereas if you come to a \"T\" junction with the wall to your left, then your first two and rightmost characters will be in melee range. Monsters will occasionally \"infiltrate\" your party, putting everyone in melee range and turning combat into a free-for-all.When your party members reach 0 hit points, they don't die; they fall unconscious. As long as they don't take any more damage, you can revive them. If your cleric falls unconscious, you're pretty much screwed unless you have some \"magic herbs.\" I'm assuming my paladin gets the ability to cast cleric spells eventually, but not yet.Until recently, my offense spells have been pretty lame. My sorcerer just got the ability to cast fireball and lightning bolt, two level 3 spells that require a lot of points and gems but really help with the more difficult monsters.I wasn't sure--still not sure--about combat order. Palamedes the  paladin and Redbeard the knight are in the first two slots, no question,  but 3 and 4 are tough decisions. It seems a waste to put an archer in a  melee position because she can shoot enemies from a distance, but it  doesn't seem like my robber or cleric will be particularly good  fighters. I ultimately decided on the archer in slot 3, the robber in  slot 4, and the two spellcasters in the rear.Despite the difficulty, I'm still enjoying the game, largely because there are so many interesting encounters throughout the maps. On one map, there's an island with crazed natives who are able to neutralize magic, another has a series of deserted \"merchants' wagons\" that alternately hold treasure and ambushing monsters. Here's a toothless old gypsy who tells my characters their \"signs,\" which I assume will come in handy later. On this map is a mysterious statue holding a scale of judgment and a trackless desert that I cannot yet cross. And deep in some mountains, I came across this oddity, which I assume will ultimately lead me from Might & Magic to its sequel:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hint: the sequel is called Might & Magic II: \"Gates to Another World.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So it's slow-going but fun slow-going. I still have no idea about the main quest (if there is one), but I'm noting anything I don't understand or can't complete on my maps, and hopefully these mysteries will all unravel in time."}, {"title": "Might & Magic I: Getting to Know You", "date": "Saturday, July 3, 2010", "text": "These sound scary and tough. They are.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I tell you, I was in a bit of a CRPG funk before I started playing Might & Magic. This game has revived me. As I wrote last night, it's hard to put my finger on exactly what I like so much about it. It probably has to do with the neat things that populate the game world, and the sense of mystery about the main quest.I spent about four hours playing today, exploring Sorpigal (incidentally, \"New\" Sorpigal from Might & Magic VI suddenly makes more sense) and its dungeon, mapping walls, clues, and encounters in Excel. I use letters on the map to indicate special encounters. In Sorpigal, I got all the way to the letter \"R\"; in The Bard's Tale, I don't think I ever got higher than the letter \"G,\" and The Bard's Tale maps are 89% bigger than Might & Magic. In other words, Might & Magic has more interesting stuff in it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sorpigal.Among the items I found in Sorpigal are numerous statues with inscriptions that provide hints as to the game and the game world. From what I can figure out so far:There's a quest involving five brothers, one in each of the main towns. Since I received only one quest in Sorpigal, this must be it.If I slay four major beasts scattered about the game world, I'll get a special prize when I find something called the \"wheel of luck.\"I need to find some idols to help a blind ancient seer named Og.If I can find a wizard named Ranalou at a place called the Korin Bluffs, he'll give me a quest that involves visiting six castles, including a difficult one named Doom.Somewhere in the enchanted forest is a castle ruled by a minotaur.The reason Sorpigal (and presumably other towns) are indoors is because a proliferation of dragons made it too dangerous to have outdoor towns.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is almost sad.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like Wizardry, Might & Magic features some squares on which you always find encounters. One of these is in a jail (6,12 on my map above). If you get by this, you can find a secret door that takes you through a darkened hallway and deposits you at another fixed encounter (4,15) which is quite difficult. My party was slain several times here before I finally beat a group of centaurs. Once I could do that, I headed down into the dungeon which, as you can see, features slightly different textures and colors.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Beneath Sorpigal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dungeon critters killed me frequently, and I finally got into the habit of returning to the town and saving at the inn after every three or four battles--or whenever I found a particularly good item. The problem with this is that returning to the inn resets all the maps, including fixed encounters, traps, and locked doors.The dungeon had some neat features, including several squares where I encountered a message saying \"don't turn around!\" Ignoring this generates difficult battles. There was also a shimmering portal that I decided to save for later--no telling where I might end up--and an \"arena\" where I can fight difficult battles against various foes but for no particular reward that I can discover. This makes me wonder if every Might & Magic game has an arena; I remember them in VI and VII.Finally, in a far corner of the dungeon, I encountered an old man who asked me to take a scroll to a wizard named Agar in another town. Does this kick-start the main quest, or is it an example of one of the first side quests in a CRPG? And aren't there a series of annoying creatures in Might & Magic VI called \"Agar's pets?\" I love it when stuff like this clicks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nice use of the passive voice. Who is going to reward me?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Might & Magic, at least at these early stages, features something that I love in a good CRPG: steady character development. As I mentioned previously, you start out with literally nothing: no gold, only a little food, and only clubs for weapons. Ever so slowly, you build experience and cash and start to find items or get enough gold to buy them. I love the feeling of replacing my short sword with a great axe, having enough money to buy a crossbow, and acquiring a few new spells when I level up. Almost all CRPGs offer this, of course, but the pacing seems particularly good in Might & Magic.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leveling up is neither too quick nor too slow.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A few other miscellaneous notes:Poison. Why does every game have to have poison? My characters keep getting poisoned from traps and troglodytes, and it's going to be ages before I can cure it. Every poisoning requires a trip to the temple to waste precious gold.Money has been tight so far. At any given time, I'm usually broke because of the costs of leveling up and healing characters. Monsters routinely give only a handful of gold pieces per battle.I discovered the hard way that some encounters depend on the direction you're facing, so if you wander in to an area from the east, you may have to turn north to read an inscription. This means I spend a lot of time in dungeons spinning fruitlessly in circles.There are many locked doors which are trapped, and my thief (or \"robber,\" as the game has it) really blows at disarming them. I did find some \"robber's tools\" that helped a little, though.Unlike Wizardry and The Bard's Tale, the maps in this game (at least so far) don't wrap back on themselves. This makes more logical sense to me.My characters age fast, from both sleeping and training. When I started everyone was 18; now they're 20 and 21. (Imagine spending three years of your life wandering around a single city.) I can tell that rejuvenation spell is going to be required at some point.At this point, I have a few options for my next steps:Leave the town and explore the outdoor areaGo back into the dungeon and see where that portal takes meGive a gem to a gnome I found in a secret room and have him teleport me to another town#3 seems to be the best role-playing option, since I received a quest to deliver a package to the city of Erliquin. I think what I'll do is explore the five main towns and their dungeons before venturing outside.Last night, I said I'd talk about combat tonight. Give me one more night on that. I think it will be more meaningful once I have a better selection of spells.Fellow CRPG players, don't you love that feeling you get when you really get into a game's groove and realize you're going to be up most of the night playing? That's what I've got. I really like this game.The nine-game series (not counting the Heroes spin-offs) begins.Might and Magic: Book One - Secret of the Inner SanctumUnited StatesNew World Computing (developer and publisher)Released in 1986 for Apple II; 1987 for Commodore 64, FM-7, PC-88, and DOS; 1988 for Macintosh, PC-98, Sharp X1, Sharp X68000, and MSX; 1992 for NESDate Started: 3 July 2010Last week, I announced that I was taking a break from The Bard's Tale II, and shortly thereafter I found myself playing a game that looks a lot like The Bard's Tale II: Might and Magic: Book One - Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Like The Bard's Tale series before it, Might and Magic is a descendant of Wizardry, offering a tile-based multi-party game in a first-person perspective. The game's approach to combat, magic, and exploration seem remarkably like its predecessors.Yet playing it, I found myself enjoying it a lot more than The Bard's Tale II. This may have been external. I finally finished my traveling season and I've returned home for a full month (expect a post nearly every night in July). But there are some game play features that improve upon what came before, even if the graphics aren't quite as good (among other things, there seems to be no animation).Might and Magic I was released for the Apple II in 1986. I'm playing a DOS port from a year later. It was the first publication of New World Computing and is the beginning of one of the most successful franchises in game history. I'm sure I played it before, back in the 1980s, but frankly I can't remember it. The first Might and Magic of which I have any real memory is III.The game does not begin promising. Based on the game manual I consulted, Might and Magic tosses you into the world with no hints whatsoever as to the world's history and what your quest is all about--or, indeed, if you even have a quest. There's a cryptic line in the manual: \"When you begin, the uncharted world of Might and Magic is as strange and unfamiliar to you as it is to your characters.\" Huh? Why is that?To get a clue, I consulted the evocative map of the Land of Varn. The map is divided into 20 sections (A1-E4), that show some neat terrain: rivers, sea, mountains, a volcano, forest, plains, a desert plateau. Towns and castles are shown on the map as are numerous monsters: a scorpion, a sea dragon, a knight on horseback. Do these indicate actual game encounters or are they just decorative? Based on a clue I picked up in the first town, Sorpigal, I think the former. A statue reads: \"One by water, one by land, one by air, one by sand. The wheel of luck will favorably pay, the more of these menacing beasts you slay. Although wishes may come true, all the beasts will become anew.\"Only the Ultima series has had cooler maps so far.The basic characteristics of the game break no new ground. There are six character classes: knight, paladin, sorcerer, cleric, archer, and robber. Each requires a different minimum combination of seven attributes: intellect, might, personality, endurance, speed, accuracy, and luck. There are five races: human, elf, dwarf, gnome, and half-orc. You can choose your alignment from good, neutral, and evil, and set your sex and name.A very basic character creation process.Character level is based on experience, which is accumulated through quests and combat. Your level determines your hit points and spell points and, for spellcasters, what spell level they can cast. The magic system features 47 sorcerer spells and 47 cleric spells, divided into 7 levels. Obviously, higher level spells use more spell points and many also require gems, which you pick up from slain foes.All characters start at age 18 and can age through magic and natural passage of time. Your skills deteriorate as you age, and after age 80 there's a chance of dying in your sleep! Fortunately, there's a rejuvenation spell to reverse old age. As in the Ultima games, your characters have a food store and they eat a meal every time you rest. One major difference that seems to be a bit unbalanced: every time you rest, all of your hit points and spell points are regenerated. As food isn't terribly expensive, this suggests the major difficulty in the game will come in the form of individual encounters rather than the culmination of encounters like Wizardry and The Bard's Tale.I created a party of six characters. I couldn't think of any reason not to just include one of each character type, so I did that, mixing races, sexes, and alignments. If you're curious, my party consists of:Palamedes, a good male half-orc paladin (kudos to Might and Magic for allowing any race to be a paladin well ahead of D&D)Redbeard, a neutral male dwarf knightKata, a neutral female elf archerLone Wolf, an evil male gnome robberSarah, a good female elf clericGrey Star, a good male human sorcererThe game starts you with clubs, 10 meals, and absolutely no gold. I needed to find something to beat with clubs before I could even think about an edged weapon. Each character has between 8 and 10 hit points and the two spellcasters have 5 spell points. Talk about brutal.Starting out in this game is tough.I ventured out to explore Sorpigal and almost immediately died at the hands of a band of six sprites who bombarded my party with \"curse\" spells making my attacks ineffective. I wanted to throw up my hands in exasperation but I re-loaded and did a little better. Through exploration, I learned:Sorpigal consists of a 16 x 16 square. Until I find otherwise, I'm going to assume that all Might and Magic areas are this size. This makes exploration a little quicker than in The Bard's Tale where all maps were 22 x 22. Might and Magic may actually have more levels (so far, I figure there are at least 20 outdoor areas, 5 towns of at least two levels each--I've already discovered that Sorpigal has a dungeon--and a couple of castles, for a minimum of around 35 areas), but I like that you can get through them at a faster clip. And unless there are ways of finding secret doors that don't simply involve walking in to walls (I've found a few that way), not all of the squares on each map are used.Exploring Sorpigal.There seems to be a lot more things in this game. I've only half-mapped Sorpigal, but I've already found half a dozen statues with cryptic clues, a trap that dumps you into the dungeon, a mystical leprechaun who offers transportation to other towns for a gem, and a jail full of monsters where if you're not careful the doors lock behind you--along with the usual shops, temple, and training facility.Unfortunately, I don't have any gems and don't know when I'll find any.Random encounters vary from somewhat easy to very hard. It took me a while to realize that you have to (s)earch the square after you finish fighting a battle or you don't get any treasure. Even when you search, the gold and experience rewards are not that high. Based on the encounters I've had so far, it's going to be a long time before my characters reach Level 2 and can afford decent equipment.Ah, the old reliable orc.The game follows The Bard's Tale's convention of only allowing you to save in the inn, so you have to be careful about getting trapped too far away. Fortunately, I've discovered that if you run from combat, instead of simply skipping the battle and leaving you where you are (as in The Bard's Tale), you end up back at the inn. In dungeons, as I found out after a trap square unceremoniously dumped me into one, fleeing takes you to the entrance. This makes up a little for the fact that one out of four combats leaves all your characters dead (at least at level 1).I'll leave combat to tomorrow's posting, but suffice to say that it seems like it has that same nail-biting ultra-tactical quality as Wizardry. I need to spend some time analyzing what makes Wizardry and this game fundamentally different from The Bard's Tale even though they seem so similar.Again, I don't know what it is, but I'm mapping and exploring with a lot more gusto than with The Bard's Tale II despite the game's difficulty. I kind of like that I have no idea what the main quest is about (I assume it has something to do with an \"inner sanctum\"). I'm looking forward to continuing this one."}, {"title": "Bard's Tale II: Hiatus", "date": "Tuesday, June 29, 2010", "text": "I can save the GAME? This is different than saving my characters?!A series of unfortunate things this week:1) I've been on the road again, this time to the west coast, and I've had lots of down time in hotel rooms in which I could have been finishing The Bard's Tale II, but I've found it so mind-crushing that I've been re-watching Firefly instead. That would be fine if my blog was called the \"geeky TV Addict.\"2) When I did finally fire up the game, I discovered to my horror that the pieces of the Destiny Wand I'd managed to collect were gone! No idea where they went. But perhaps it's related to...3) I discovered that there's a \"save game\" option completely independent of saving your characters, and that you can save anywhere--even in dungeons. Somehow I missed this in the manual. I had been trekking back to a guild every time I wanted to save, and then I was only saving my characters attributes, not what I had accomplished in the game. Bollocks.4) Insistent that I was not going to replay the previous dungeons just to find those wand pieces again, I downloaded a character editor, frigged around with it, and ended up corrupting my character files, of which I had not made backups.So I'm faced with the task of starting completely over in The Bard's Tale II. And you know what? I'm going to do it. My posts lately have sucked, I've been playing  with a bad attitude, and finishing the damned thing is my penance. But I'm going to take a one-game break before I tackle it again. Might and Magic I is the next game on my list, and it was released the same year as The Bard's Tale II, so technically I'm not going out of order. I'm downloading it now and getting back into the game.Much Later Edit: After finishing Might & Magic, I have no desire to return to The Bard's Tale II."}, {"title": "Bard's Tale II: Not Feelin' It", "date": "Thursday, June 24, 2010", "text": "I'm going to say \"death and drek!\" every time I curse from now on.When I last wrote about The Bard's Tale II, I was \"waiting for it to get difficult.\" My wait didn't last long. By the time I got to the third level of the Ephesus tombs, I was facing some pretty tough critters. Not tough enough to send me crying home to mama, but the game definitely notched it up. I expect it to get harder from hereon in.My biggest problem now is fighting boredom. This game is an endless slog through dungeons and battles. The little obstacles in the dungeons--spinners, teleporters, anti-magic zones, zones of darkness--are more \"annoyances\" than challenges.I managed to find the first segment of the Destiny Wand. The \"snare\" part of the dungeon was somewhat interesting. I assume the other segments involve something similar. Basically, I had to interpret a series of clues written on the dungeon walls to get through the maze and find the segment. The moment I entered the \"snare,\" a voice told me that I had a limited amount of time, but it couldn't have been that limited, because it took me a while to bumble through it. Spells didn't work, and the \"time out\" function was disabled. The puzzle consisted of:A pool of water that poisoned my characters when I drank itAn old warrior who offered to join my partyA creature called a \"toxic giant.\"Clues from the walls suggested that I should put the old man first in my party and he should \"light the way.\" Others informed me that only poisoned characters could defeat the toxic giant. So I put the old guy in the number one slot, poisoned everyone from the pool, killed the giant, and got a torch from it. I gave the torch to the old feller, which revealed a secret door, behind which I found the wand segment. Woo-hoo.Earlier in the level, I solved a rhyming riddle to get a hint as to the next dungeon I should explore: Fanskar's Fortress. This was confirmed by the Sage, who for a bundle of gold told me where it was, which was nice except I already knew from having mapped the wilderness. That's where I am now.The creators made the game a little more tactical by putting distance between  your party and the enemies (check out the first screen shot above),  forcing you (or the monsters) to \"advance\" towards each other before you  can engage in melee combat. I keep getting into fights with liches and  mages in which they repeatedly summon monsters, and I spend a combat  round killing their summoned monsters. Then they summon more. Round and  round we go, with spellcasters remaining outside melee range, and you  can't \"advance\" towards them as long as there are other monsters closer  than they are. My only options are to invest in ranged weapons, but  these take precious spaces in your inventory slots, or to cast the MEME spell, which yanks them into melee range but costs a boatload of spell points.Yeah, so even I'm going to vote \"meh\" on this posting, but that's really how I feel about the game. It's extremely linear and repetitive, and the endless combats are annoying. Character development is nil: my spellcasters already have all the spells and my other characters' stats are maxed. I get a few hit points and spell points for each level up, but that's it. I feel like I should be enjoying the tactical combat more, but I'm just not. I don't know whether it's me or the game, but I'll give it a few more days and move on if it still doesn't click."}, {"title": "Game Economies", "date": "Wednesday, June 23, 2010", "text": "Morrowind, otherwise one of the best CRPGs I've ever played, has the most idiotic economy of any modern game. At the beginning, you're so poor that you can barely afford your first chitin sword. You're hauling wooden buckets and oars from a nearby cave for the few pennies that you can get for them at Arille's Tradehouse in Seyda Neen. You're burglarizing houses and stealing pillows. This is fun and challenging, and it's a real reward when you can buy your first mortar and pestle or decent stock of arrows.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \"A plate, a cup, a fork, and a candelabra?! Soon I will be able to afford a pair of steel boots!\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Then, sometime around hour five, you stumble in to a Daedric ruin somewhere, kill a dremora, and suddenly you have a weapon worth so much that literally no merchant in the game can buy it. You sell it to Creeper for one-third of its value, and money no longer has any meaning. You can buy anything. Two or three trips to the ruins, and you can train your character up to level 100 in any skill you desire (Morrowind, unlike Oblivion, places no limit on the number of times you can train per level). The economy, if you let it, breaks the game.Bad economies, it seems to me, are the rule rather than the exception in most CRPGs. Oblivion doesn't have the training bug, but you do reach a point rather quickly in which amassing a fortune no longer makes sense, even accounting for buying and furnishing houses in every town. I remember in Baldur's Gate II slaughtering an entire map full of fighters with swords +3 and not even bothering to take them to sell them. This is particularly annoying because many of the \"evil\" role-playing choices in these games center on trying to bully more money out of people, burglarizing houses, selling stolen loot, and so on. What's the point of doing all this if money comes so easily anyway and there's nothing cool to buy?To me, a good CRPG is one in which money has real value--you never run out of reasons to collect it, kill monsters for it, and quest for it. Some of these early CRPGs, like The Bard's Tale II (my current game), sort-of fit the bill because they have one or two expensive things that make money valuable. In The Bard's Tale II, those things are the mystic emporium, where you recharge spell points, and temples, where you heal your characters of death and petrification. Since the costs for these things go up with your level, it makes sense to keep collecting cash. In Phantasie, leveling up cost so much that I was constantly under-funded. But this is a boring sort of economy. Contrast this with Ultima IV, where you had a role-playing choice about whether to cheat the blind herb seller. Some reagents are damned expensive, and cheating is a real temptation. After all, you want to outfit four of your characters with magic wands, and they cost 5,000 gold pieces each.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 If only I wasn't trying to achieve avatarhood.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Always needing cash is not the only part of a good economy, though. I like games in which there's always a cooler magic weapon waiting for purchase, where you can sell looted weapons, armor, and gear to shops (the Elder Scrolls games are particularly good with this), where gold from your fallen foes is a tangible object that makes a satisfying clink as you pick it up (for some reason, I love the graphics and sounds associated with money in Icewind Dale II). I particularly like it when there are goods and services not strictly essential to the main quest that you nonetheless might want to buy: Oblivion's houses are a good example, as are tankards of expensive drinks. You feel like you're really role-playing when your Baldur's Gate crew staggers into Nashkel from the mines and each character gets thoroughly drunk on pints of dragon's blood.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Six wyvern kebabs, medium rare.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Let me see if I can recall a few economy-related quirks from other games:If you play a fighter in Baldur's Gate II, you can get a castle for your stronghold. You get a number of stronghold-related quests in which you have options ranging from, say, paying 20,000 gold pieces to strengthen your land's fortifications against outside invaders all the way to erecting no fortifications, executing the person who suggested it, and then levying a punitive tax against your subjects (I'm getting the details wrong, but in spirit this is right). The problem is, by this point in the game you have so much money that you're almost grateful for an excuse to spend as much of it as possible, making what could be a sincere role-playing choice almost no choice at all.In Wizard's Crown and the later SSI games based on the D&D rules, there are multiple types of coins, just like in pen and paper D&D. If you lug around too much cash in Pool of Radiance, it slows you movement and hurts you in combat. Most games treat gold as if it has no weight.In Ultima VII, you can burglarize the royal mint. Since spells and reagents are so expensive, it takes a real role-playing choice not to do this.Fortunately, you don't actually have to achieve avatarhood in this game.Alternate Reality: the City started you out with a paltry amount of cash but gave you the option to do menial jobs for an honest wage. This took precious game time, but it was a nice touch of realism. I seem to recall that in Ultima VII you can try to make some income baking bread.It's only tangentially related, but I love how in Neverwinter Nights, you've just been given a mission to save the city from destruction, and yet you still have to buy your weapons and armor from the temple shop. A lot of games do something similar.Games in which you can pay for training (not level-increasing training but skill-increasing training) offer a good reason to quest for cash. Aside from Wizard's Crown and The Elder Scrolls games, I can't think of any off hand. I would love it if Baldur's Gate offered you the ability to add a + to one of your weapon skills for 10,000 gold, or add one point to an attribute for 15,000.Racking my brain, I can think of only two games that have truly \"good\" economies. The first is Might and Magic VI. First, there are many, many, things to buy: weapons, armor, helmets, boots, alchemical ingredients, rings, wands, and so on. Skill acquisition and training also cost a lot of cash. Fortunately, you can sell items you loot back to the shops. Still, for much of the game, you're struggling to get enough money to train and outfit all of your characters, which is as it should be. Later in the game, you find yourself with an overabundance of money, like in most games, but at that point you find a magic well in Kriegspire that takes your gold for an equivalent amount of experience. Gold, therefore, remains relevant until the very end of the game. Might and Magic VII and VIII have similar economies in general but lack the magic well.The second is the Hordes of the Underdark expansion to Neverwinter Nights. There are two excellent reasons to get rich in this game. First, about halfway through you find a smith who will take any weapon and add a variety of enchantments (increase the +, make it do fire damage, and so on) for lots of money. (I should point out that Wizard's Crown offered this option but I didn't play long enough to get into it.) You never have enough to buy all of the upgrades. Second, late in the game you meet the Knower of Names, who for gold will tell you the \"true names\" of various NPCs in the game. You never have enough gold to buy all of the names, and which ones you do buy has significant role-playing consequences, since equipped with an NPC's true name, you can order him or her to do all sorts of things. For some ridiculous amount of gold, you can even purchase the true name of the demon prince Mephistopheles (the game's villain) and completely skip the game-ending battle by simply ordering him to kill himself!\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bargaining with the Knower of Names\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I haven't played every CRPG, of course--not yet--so there might be other good ones out there. Let me know what you think in the comments.In the era I'm playing now, economies are very basic, with only a few ways to get cash (there aren't even any side-quests yet) and even fewer to spend it. I'll keep rating this category on the GIMLET scale, though, and we'll see how the economies evolve."}, {"title": "Bard's Tale II: Waiting for It to Get Difficult", "date": "Sunday, June 20, 2010", "text": "Yes, yes: legions of horrific undead. .Okay, so I followed y'all's advice and kept my Bard's Tale I characters. To make it at least somewhat challenging, I ditched all their equipment. I changed my two spellcasters to the new \"archmage\" class, bought some basic swords and armor (the shop in every town is called \"Garth's,\" just like in Skara Brae), and set out......and promptly got bored. The game threw all kinds of monsters at me that couldn't even begin to touch me. The critter I summoned didn't even take a hit during the three hours it took me to map the wilderness.The \"wilderness\" is a 48 x 32 area with six cities, a handful of huts, and dozens of trees that serve in the basic capacity as dungeon walls, forcing you to navigate around them. The cities are all named after ancient Greek metropolises: Corinth, Ephesus, Philippi, and so on.As usual, I mapped it in Excel.One of the huts, incidentally, holds the \"Temple of Narn.\" I have no idea what I'm supposed to do here--I'm sure it becomes clear later--but I hope it has something to do with G'Kar.\"What do you want?\"The game manual told me to seek out the Sage's hut and ask the Sage about the Tombs. The Sage required a bit of a bribe, but I managed to get a hint from him to visit the city of Ephesus. This led me to my first dungeon; I am currently mapping level 2 and still haven't had a decent stand-up fight.The basic trouble with The Bard's Tale II is that it's too much like The Bard's Tale, just bigger. So far, I'm encountering copious monsters, messages scrawled on dungeon walls, teleporters, traps, zones of darkness, anti-magic zones, magic mouths, and everything that I already experienced a couple of months ago. Since I don't even have the satisfaction of character development to go along with it, this game promises to be fairly tedious.One good thing, though: there's an archmage spell called BASP (\"batch spell\") that simultaneously casts all of the buffing spells (levitate, sorcerer's sight, greater revelation, shield, and magic compass) at once. That saves a little bit of annoyance.Expect a lot of \"special topic\" postings as I play this one."}, {"title": "Game 18: The Bard's Tale II (1986)", "date": "Saturday, June 19, 2010", "text": "The Bard's Tale II: The Destiny KnightUnited StatesInterplay (developer); Electronic Arts (publisher)Released 1986 for Commodore 64; 1987 for Apple II; 1988 for Amiga, Apple II GS, and DOS; 1991 for PC-98; 1992 for NESDate Started: 19 June 2010\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Bard's Tale II: The Destiny Knight picks up shortly after the first installment of the game. The premise and main quest are provided in a single page of the game manual: 700 years ago, an archmage named Turin forged an artifact called the Destiny Wand in the molten depths of the holy mountain Krontor. The power of the wand maintained peace and prosperity for seven centuries, but then the evil archmage Lagoth Zanta, ruler of the neighboring kingdom of Lestradae, stole the Destiny Wand and broke it into seven pieces, hiding each in a different dungeon, in a puzzle room called a \"Snare of Death.\" Lagoth Zanta's monsters and mercenaries are now roaming freely across the realm. Now, the wizard Saradon has called my party, fresh from our Bard's Tale I victory over Mangar in Skara Brae, to find the pieces and reforge the wand, promising \"unimaginable power\" if we do.(Many thanks, incidentally, to The Adventurer's Guild, which has the original documents for each of The Bard's Tale games.)The game was originally released for the Commodore 64 in 1986. It was ported for the Apple II in 1987 and for DOS in 1988. That, of course, is the version I'm playing.You begin in the Guild of Adventurers, next to a roaring fire, listening to a bard strumming an eight-bit banjo.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Reading through the manual, it looks as though not much has changed since The Bard's Tale. The basic interface and combat actions are the same, and so are most of the spells. From what I can tell so far, the differences are:The ability to summon creatures and slot NPCs in ANY available slot, not  just a single slot at the top of the party list.Slightly better graphics for everything, including dungeon textures, city views, monsters, and character portraits.A few new spells, including some \"mystery\" spells that you have to figure out at some point in the game. There is also (finally!) a stone-to-flesh spell.An \"archmage\" is not just a title you get when you complete levels in  all four mage classes; it is a separate class with its own spells.Instead of a single city with five dungeons, there are multiple cities, dungeons, castles, and wilderness areas.The official game map.Missile weapons exist.All of the bard songs have been renamed, there are seven instead of six, and the effects are slightly different.Some battles start with your characters not quite engaged with the enemy--they can be some distance away, allowing them to shoot missile weapons at you before you advance and engage them.New monsters, some with strange names.\"Wander mages\"?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Already I'm facing an interesting dilemma. The game allows you to import your characters from The Bard's Tale, which I did, finding to my surprise that the import retained all their levels and items! This means I have absurdly powerful Level 28 characters, including two characters who have achieved all spell levels in four mage classes and can both transition to archmages. I like being rewarded for finishing previous games, but I also like a challenge, and this seems a little too easy. Thus, I'm mulling four options:Play with my existing party and breeze on through--at least the opening sectionsRetain one or two of my existing characters but drop the rest and start the rest of my party at level 1Play with a brand new party but keep my existing spellcasters in the Guild of Adventurers so I can use them to heal/resurrect my new characters if they dieDelete my old characters entirely and start afreshAny opinions, especially from those who have played The Bard's Tale II before?I'm looking forward to stepping back into this world."}, {"title": "Wizard's Crown: Packing It In", "date": "Friday, June 18, 2010", "text": "A Wizard's Crown dungeon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I hope it's obvious by now that I hate to start a game and not finish it. Since I started this blog, the only games I haven't finished (that were \"winnable\") are Wizardry II and Wizardry III, and this had more to do with their rules about character creation and importing than it did with the games themselves.But Wizard's Crown is simply no fun. It has some neat innovations, but these are wrapped in countless hours of rote combat and death. I was toying with quitting it during my last posting. Then I went to D.C. for a few days and slept on it. When I got back today, I played for a few hours, but I'm just not feelin' it. I'm going to give it a final ranking here with the understanding that I didn't finish the game so I may have missed some things.1. Game world. There's an interesting setup in the game manual having to do with a golden age brought to a close by a theft and usurpation. I covered this in my first Wizard's Crown posting. There isn't much history or lore associated with the game, though. You encounter buildings and dungeons with intriguing names but no back story. There are a couple of quests, like clearing the town of thugs, that have some effect on the game world, but otherwise your presence isn't really felt. Final score: 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The introduction from the game manual.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. Character creation and development. It's not bad. Although I was confused during the creation process, the game is fairly unique in the way it gives you experience points to divide among different skills. I'm not sure I ever came up with a good strategy for it, and there were some skills that never seemed to be used, but kudos to the developers for including a character development system ahead of its time. Since you get experience from every battle and can spend it more-or-less immediately, character development is swift and constant. This is the first game to allow selection of your own icons (although from a limited pool), and it might be the first to allow multi-classing. On the other hand, the game offers the exact same experience no matter what your class. Final score: 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Spending experience to increase skills.3. NPC Interaction. Virtually none. There's an old man in a park who tells you different stories, and a girl you can save from some thugs, but your interaction with them is limited to just listening what they say. You learn a few things about the game world from them, but there is no dialog or role-playing opportunities. Most of the game is combat. Final score: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your primary NPC interaction is an old man ranting about some nonsense.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4. Encounters and foes. There are no real unique monsters in Wizard's Crown that I could see--just your standard D&D fare like goblins, orcs, and brigands. Such monsters are not described in the manual or the game itself, and they're distinguishable from each other only in their icons. There are no opportunities for role-playing in the encounters. There are a mix of random and fixed encounters in both dungeons and surface, which is nice. The surface constantly re-spawns (you never \"clear\" it), and there's an option to reset dungeon levels in case you want to play them again, which is nice. Final score: 3.5. Magic and combat. Tactical combat, described in my last posting, is where Wizard's Crown really shines. There are almost too many options having do to with range and direction of attack, but it's hard to complain about the complexity when the game offers a \"quick combat\" option. You can theoretically role play during combat by having your characters behave in unique ways. The magic system is a little weak, offering a paltry selection of spells for mages (I did finally get these to work by pouring experience into spellcasting) and no offensive spells for priests. If your characters are knocked unconscious or killed during battle, you cannot heal them, which is a bit of a drag. My biggest problem with combat was that I could never do as well in the tactical combat as I did in the quick combat--you would think the reverse would be true. Final score: 5.6. Equipment. Wizard's Crown offers a wide variety of weapons, armor, and accessories, and it's not too hard to figure out how the items compare to each other. These are generally randomized within the game world, and you even have the opportunity to \"customize\" items by paying to increase their enchantments. None of the items are described, however, and there are a lot of baffling accessories that either do nothing or I just couldn't figure it out. Final score: 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I saw no reason to visit the armory after my first visit.\u00a0\u00a0 7. Economy. You get gold for killing monsters, but there's hardly anything to buy with it. You can buy a limited amount of training, but beyond that it's just about increasing item enchantment, which costs way more gold than I ever had. The good news is, because it's so expensive, you never find yourself with too much gold. Final score: 4.8. Quests. There is a main quest in the game, but it's easy to forget because the game doesn't give you a lot of hints about how to proceed along it. There appears only one outcome to this quest, and no opportunities for role-playing. I counted two side quests, one of which I guess allowed some limited role-playing (I could have let a young woman get beaten by thugs). Final score: 3.9. Graphics, sound, and inputs. The graphics are mediocre, especially on the character and dialog screens which are text-only. The only sound is the occasional combat effect. Keyboard commands are intuitive enough and easy to grasp, but constantly having to specify a point man when you leave camp is annoying. Final score: 2.10. Gameplay. The world is so constraining, and it's so hard to avoid dying, that the game feels very linear. It offers no different experiences on replay, and I found that it varied between too easy and too hard: either I won combats in a snap or I was thoroughly trounced. Final score: 2.Final score: 32. This puts it above some of the worst games on my list, but not as high as Wizardry or The Bard's Tale, which feels right.Next up: The Bard's Tale II!*****Further reading: Not satisfied with my abrupt departure from this game in the early days of my blog?

Read the updated entry."}, {"title": "Wizard's Crown: Ultra-Tactical Combat", "date": "Monday, June 14, 2010", "text": "An unfortunately common message in my Wizard's Crown adventuresSince I last blogged about Wizard's Crown, I have:Found the marketplace where I can sell goods. This is different than the Town Square, which had me confused.Cleared the town of monsters and got 2 gold pieces a person for my trouble.Received a broadsword +2 as a reward for rescuing the aforementioned girl.\u00a0 What, does everyone know I'm after this crown? Nice punctuation,  incidentally. Found a hidden magic shop where some day, when I have way more gold than I do now, I can improve the enchantments on my weapons and armor.Got some hints at a tavern. I need an emerald key to get somewhere. The password to something else is \"breakfast.\" A master thief told me of a thieves' guild in the ruins I ultimately have to explore.Fought a lot of battles for which I got experience. I used this experience to increase my weapon, magic, and thieving skills. Putting a lot of points into karma for my priests turned out to be a good thing because it gave me access to high-level healing spells fairly quickly.Discovered temples scattered about town which immediately recharge your priests' karma. It's handy to use these immediately after battle and heal your characters.\u00a0 I'm still confused about a lot of stuff. For instance, I keep finding bottles and jars and wands after I kill monsters, but they don't seem to have any purpose. The game manual suggests that I can spend experience on increasing statistics but the game never gives me that option (maybe I need a lot more experience than I've been accumulating). My sorcerer never seems to be able to cast a spell successfully no matter how many points I channel into power and spellcasting ability. Every time I leave the inn or camp, the game asks me who I want to put on point and how far away I want them to scout, but for the life of me I can't figure out what this actually does or who I should choose.\u00a0 It wouldn't be so bad if you could set a default.All of this pales in comparison to my most serious conundrum, though, which is that I don't know what to do from here without dying. Every time I leave the town, I die. I don't mean a single character dies--this is easily fixed with a \"raise dead\" prayer, which believe it or not I already have. I mean my whole party gets wiped out. But since I cleared the town of monsters, wandering around in town only occasionally offers up a paltry battle in which I get some minimum of experience. I feel kind of stuck.While I figure this out, let me use this space to talk about the tactical combat system, which is both interesting and confounding. I can only say that I'm glad that they simplified it for the Gold Box games, because there are enough statistics and options in combat to give a migraine to Sun Tzu.Let's start at the beginning. When you come across a group of monsters in Wizard's Crown, the game asks whether you want to engage in quick combat. If you do this, the game fights your battle for you in seconds, which is nice, but you don't get to use the full variety of spells, items, and actions at your disposal, which is not. The only way to successfully win difficult battles is to do it the long way. Unfortunately, at this stage the game doesn't tell you how many of each monster type you face, so it's tough to gauge whether quick combat is worth the risk.To be fair, a \"thug\" really isn't a monster type so much as a profession.If you choose to eschew \"quick combat,\" the game puts you into a tactical battle screen. The first step is \"placing\" your characters--selecting their starting positions. You have a limited space in which to work, but it's easy to set up a defensive wall with your spellcasters and archers protected.Placing my characters before combat.Now we come to the first thing I don't understand: why can't I see my enemies? It's not that they're off-screen. Oh, no. As soon as battle starts, they'll be right up against me. I don't know why they get to be hidden until they attack.After the placement phase, the combat phase begins. There are no less than 20 actions that each of your characters can perform in combat. There are three attacks: a regular (a)ttack, a reckless \"attack to (k)ill\" that sacrifices defense for offense, and a conservative (d)efensive attack that does the opposite. If you want a sure hit, you can waste an entire round aiming at your (t)arget before exercising an attack the next round, or you can spend your round (z)ig-zagging to avoid being hit entirely.Gahmuret targets a thug with his bow.You can (f)all prone if you're facing archers and you want to minimize your chance of getting hit, then stand (e)rect once you engage them in melee combat. If you're an archer, you can (l)oad your bow or crossbow, a sorcerer can (c)ast a spell (although, and this is item #2 I don't understand, they never seem to work) or use a (m)agic item, and a priest can (p)ray to heal companions in combat or turn (u)ndead. Thieves can (s)neak, but I'm not sure what this does because there doesn't seem to be a back stab. There's also a (v)iew command which maybe is my solution to the hidden enemy problem, although it never seems to do anything. If you run into a door on the combat screen, you can (o)pen it. You can waste a turn (r)eadying a different piece of equipment, and finally you can (i)nspect your character or just (q)uit your turn. Understand that all of these various commands apply to each character in each round.This happens literally every time.Ah, but that's not all. The game also considers the direction you're facing when calculating the likelihood to hit, how much damage you do, whether you can target a particular enemy, or whether your shield does anything to protect you. Note in the screenshot below how the northeast, east, and southeast are highlighted (the \"9\" and the \"3\" correspond to directions on the numeric keypad). This means I can move, attack, and (I think) defend in those directions. If I want to aim or move somewhere else, I first have to use the comma key to turn my character in that direction.This battle isn't going so badly, but note that Anfortas has a moderate injury (6) and minor bleeding (2), but still has all 25/25 of his life points.When you strike a hit, or when any enemy strikes a hit against you, the game is very specific about where it does damage and what kind of damage it does. This lends the game an air of realism, but it also introduces a quirk unique to Wizard's Crown: the overall number of hit points that you have is treated separate from your current level of injury. There are two types of injuries: bleeding and...well...just injuries. You can have a serious injury and be knocked unconscious and still have all 25/25 of your hit points. Bizarre.This does make it more fun to picture the battle.When battle is over, you get a bit of gold and you can take the items owned by your enemies--usually just basic weapons and armor that you can sell. Occasionally you find bandages, which a party member skilled in first aid can use and thus save your priests' karma points.I have no idea what that vial is about.Also after combat, you want to check out your party members' statuses. In my case, Feirefiz has a minor injury, Anfortas has both minor and major injuries and minor bleeding, and Sigune has a major injury and minor bleeding. If you leave the camp while your characters are still bleeding, they die, so this is where I have to use my priests' healing power to deal with their injuries. Note again, however, that none of them have suffered a loss of life points.\u00a0 Tactical combat can take up to an hour with enough enemies. This is particularly frustrating because, as I've said, every time I leave the town, all my characters die. Wasting 30 minutes on combat only to lose everyone and have to start over is a bit demoralizing--and not just to me. The longer the combat takes, the more your characters' \"morale\" score dips, making them less effective at all of their skills. You have to spend a night in a comfy room or spend an evening of revelry at a tavern to eradicate the effects of poor morale and get your characters in fighting strength again. This is another first for Wizard's Crown.My morale is restored and I got a hint on the side.I'll echo what I said yesterday: I'm grateful to this game for being an obvious precursor to the Gold Box series, but I can't say I'm loving it. Nonetheless, I'm determined to improve my characters enough to start exploring the ruins and see how they differ from the very constricted game so far. Again, I certainly appreciate any tips or advice from readers who have played this game before!"}, {"title": "Game 17: Wizard's Crown (1985)", "date": "Sunday, June 13, 2010", "text": "This may be the least attractive opening screen of any game yet, but it speaks to the game's emphasis on tactics and statistics.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wizard's CrownUnited StatesStrategic Simulations, Inc. (developer and publisher)Released in 1985 or 1986* for Apple II, Commodore 64, and Atari 8-bit; 1987 for Atari ST and DOSDate Started:\u00a0 13 June 2010\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 [Note from 28 July 2017: The entry below begins my first experience with Wizard's Crown in 2010. I wrote three entries on the game and then abandoned it as being no fun and too hard. More than 7 years later, I revisited it in anticipation of playing its sequel. I found it easier this time and finished it. I recommend skipping to that entry instead of reading the lower-quality entries from 2010.]I had never heard of SSI's Wizard's Crown before starting this blog, and I never played it until today. Just looking through the manual, I can see its influence on the later D&D \"Gold Box\" games, so I'm grateful for this opportunity to play it, but damn is it confusing.The basic plot of the game seems simple: once upon a time the (unnamed) land was governed by a Fellowship of Wizards who ruled justly from the beautiful city of Arghan. These wizards took turns wearing the Crown of the Emperor, a magical artifact that gave \"power and reason.\" Then one day a wizard named Tarmon refused to give up the crown at his appointed time, prompting a civil war during which Arghan was destroyed and hosts of monsters were raised. Tarmon sequestered himself in his laboratories.500 years later, Arghan is still infested with monsters and sealed off from the world by a magic barrier. But the wizard Kaltar has raised a party of eight adventurers to venture into the city and retrieve the Crown so that a new age of peace might dawn.The game starts you with a pre-created party of eight adventurers, but of course I immediately dumped them to create my own. I almost wish I hadn't. Maybe by typing it out I can work through some of my confusion. Here's what's clear:There are five available character classes: fighter, ranger, thief, priest, and sorcerer. You can have multi-class characters.Each character has five attributes: strength, dexterity, intelligence, life (hit points), and experience.Each character has a ranking in any number of skills, including combat skills (sword, bow, close combat), magic skills (karma for priests, power for sorcerers), thief skills (search, disarm, pick lock, haggling), healing skills (treat poison, treat disease, first aid), ranger skills (stealth, hunt, track), and miscellaneous skills (swimming, haggling, alchemy). There are 30 skills total. Their initial value depends on your attributes, but they can be increased by spending your experience points.When you create a character, you set your attributes first by spending a pool of 25 points. The level to which you set your intelligence determines what type of class you can choose. For instance, a thief needs only 3 intelligence points but a sorcerer needs 11. If you want to have a multi-class thief/sorcerer, you need 14 points.Character creation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Here's what I'm confused about:Is it better to go with single-class characters or multi-class characters? What mix works best? The manual suggests that \"most party members should be fighters; only 1 or 2 should be non-fighters.\" I assume they mean multi-classed fighters, because this otherwise contradicts with its advice to \"have at least one character of each profession.\" The manual also insists that you have a ranger-priest but doesn't say why.Is there any advantage to increasing intelligence above the point at which you get the character class you want? The manual unhelpfully notes that \"since intelligence does influence other factors, it just might be worth purchasing more sometimes.\" What other factors?The game lets you buy experience right off the bat, which you can then use to increase your skills. Is it better to use the points to increase your attributes, or your skills? Do you have the option to increase them both later with acquired experience, or am I setting my permanent attribute levels at this point?This is just what I'm confused about when it comes to character creation. I can barely understand a word of the combat instructions. I guess there's only one thing to do: make my party as best I can and go out and experiment. I've decided to channel my initial allocation of points into attributes and only buy as much intelligence as I need for the classes I want. I'm going with:One pure fighterTwo fighter/sorcerersTwo fighter/priestsOne ranger/priestOne thiefOne sorcererFeirefiz is my pure fighter.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the character creation process, you select the icon that represents your character in the game. These are quite similar to the later SSI D&D games, although without the color customization choices.This is the first game that lets you choose what your character looks like.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The game starts you off with a weapon of your choice (for fighters) or with a dagger (everyone else). Everyone gets brigantine armor.The world outside the inn.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having made my characters, I wandered out into the game world and within moments came across a woman fleeing from a couple of thugs. I chose to intervene and engage in quick combat rather than try to figure out the game's bedazzling combat options this early.The first quest!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My characters dispatched the thugs and took a fair amount of injury themselves. One of my characters, the fighter/priest Condwiramurs, was bleeding, and the game warned me if I left the combat options screen without healing her, she would be destroyed. Unfortunately, nothing I could think to do would work. We found some bandages during combat, but even though I gave them to someone who was skilled at first aid, the game insisted I didn't have any bandages. I tried to (P)ray for healing but the game insisted none of my priests could pray--it may have had something to do with a morale loss greater than their karma levels. I don't know. There's a lot of stuff to keep track of in this game. Anyway, end result: Condwiramurs died and I had to return to the inn to replace her with another fighter/priest of the same name.The quick combat screen.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I continued my wanderings and entered the nearby town, where I found training grounds (it looks like you can increase your skills with money irrespective of experience), a temple, and an armory. An old man in a park told me a story about an adventurer who made money cleaning up the city. A group of thieves attacked me but I beat them and this time praying for healing worked. After the combat, I have some items to sell, but the armory didn't seem to have a place to sell them, just to buy them. The manual says that items are sold in the town's marketplace, but every time I search in that area, the game just tells me townsfolk are wandering about.In short, Wizard's Crown has a fairly steep learning curve. Before my next posting, I'll try detailed combat and see how that goes. In the meantime, since my rules forbid me to look at any walkthroughs, I'd appreciate any tips from people who have played the game.Ultima IV's unusual and fascinating quest is introduced. (This is the original DOS version screen shot. Most of my others have been from the Xu4 upgrade.)Again, I'm basing my final ranking on the 100-point GIMLET scale that I introduced in this posting.1. Game world. This is one of Ultima IV's strongest points. Gameplay takes place in a fairly large world scattered with cities, towns, keeps, castles, and dungeons. The world has a rich and compelling back story, interesting characters, history, and lore. You understand immediately how the Quest of the Avatar fits into the overall context of the world. The only place it fails is in the \"your decisions and actions measurably affect the game world\" point. As in almost all CRPGs of the era, the world does not really respond to what you do. For instance, when you achieve Avatarhood, nobody acknowledges it. Characters continue to tell you about items that you demonstrably have. This one drawback is outweighed by the rich, interesting world. Final score: 8.Part of the rich and fascinating History of Britannia.2. Character creation and development. Ultima IV features a unique method of character creation, in which you determine your class by answering a series of questions about virtues. Unfortunately, nothing else about character creation and development in Ultima IV really shines. You progress through eight levels by killing monsters and solving quests, but the only thing that really happens when you increase levels is that you get more hit points. (With the Avatar, you also get the option to add one new companion for each level.) Leveling up is somewhat anticlimactic, and there's almost nothing customizable about your character except for the class. Final score: 4.3. NPC interaction. Again, Ultima IV is utterly unique in its method of NPC interaction, in which you type in keywords. The game is full of NPCs, and you absolutely have to talk to them--practically all of them--to advance in the game and uncover the mysteries of the land. NPC interaction is also necessary to the role-playing aspects of the game, as only by answering truthfully can you advance in honesty, and only by answering humbly can you advance in humility. Sometimes the NPCs have very little to say, and there are only a few dialog \"choices,\" and you can't really establish relationships with any of them, but NPC interaction is still one of the game's strongest points. Final score: 7.\u00a0 4. Encounters and foes. There are quite a few monsters in the game, each with different strengths and powers, each fully described in the game manual's wonderful prose. Your encounters with them offer opportunities for role-playing--for instance, you have to let fleeing enemies escape to uphold honor, and you have to avoid attacking non-evil creatures to advance in justice. There are both scripted encounters in dungeon rooms and random encounters everywhere else. Respawning is constant. Nonetheless, battles do quickly become repetitive and tiresome. Final score: 6.5. Magic and combat. The game has an unusual magic system involving the need to purchase and mix reagents before casting spells. Like monsters, reagents and spells are thickly and entertainingly described in the game manuals. But, in general, Ultima IV is very weak in this area. Much is made about the need to discover nightshade and mandrake in the game world, but you barely need them. I don't think I cast more than half a dozen spells that required either. Combat gets boring quickly, especially once your characters have ranged weapons. Most of the time, it's far too easy. I didn't cast a single offensive spell during my gameplay, and the 99 healing spells I mixed before entering the Abyss went entirely unused. There are some tactics involved in successfully navigating dungeon rooms, but the overall lack of danger (only one of my characters died in the game, and only once) means that you have little incentive to carefully plan battles. On the plus side, it's neat how you have to discover the reagents for certain spells by talking to NPCs. Final score: 3.I mixed 10 fireball spells, and the only time I cast one was for this screen shot.6. Equipment. Minimal. You have eight types of armor and eight types of weapons, and you figure out which is best by their cost. The items are not described at all. You cannot find weapons, armor, or any other items in the game world itself; you just buy them from shops. The sextant, magic gems, and keys are interesting but not enough to make up for the weaknesses. Final score: 2.7. Economy. On the plus side, you never reach a point where you don't need money. Weapons, armor, reagents, food, gems, torches, and keys are expensive. On the negative side, the economy is a little unbalanced: you get too little gold for killing creatures and too much sitting around in dungeons. It's neat how the game works gold into the virtue development system, though: you have to avoid cheating the blind herb seller and looting treasuries in town. Final score: 6.8. Quests. The main quest of Ultima IV is something really never seen before or since in any CRPG, and no one that plays the game ever forgets it. It is, to my mind, the only CRPG quest that's directly applicable to the real world, and it's possible that completing the main quest of Ultima IV makes you a better person. There is, unfortunately, only one way to complete it, and there are no side-quests in the game. Final score: 8.\u00a0 9. Graphics, sound, inputs. I played a more recent upgrade, but even in the original the graphics aren't horrible, except perhaps in the dungeons where the multi-colored walls look a bit silly. Monsters are well-distinguished by their animated icons. I played most of the game with the sound off because there are no separate controls for regular sound and music. The music is memorable but gets on your nerves. Sound effects consist mostly of boops and (like all games of this era) have no realism. The controls, though, are easy to learn, intuitive, and responsive. Final score: 4.10. Gameplay. Gameplay in Ultima IV is completely alinear until the end. You can wander in any direction and explore the towns and dungeons in any order. Since the game map constitutes a complete world, there is very little sense of constraint at any point. There is, however, essentially no replayability to Ultima IV; even playing different classes offers up the exact same experience. The overall pacing is good--the only reason it took me two months to finish is because I was traveling (in real life) almost nonstop during the period. Ultimately, however, it's a little too easy. Final score: 5.Total score: 53. This correctly gives the game the highest ranking of games I've played so far, although I'm surprised how close it is to Ultima III which I liked but didn't love. Frankly, I think I ranked Ultima III a little too high (rather than ranking Ultima IV too low). Ultima IV's story and quest are unparalleled even today, but judging strictly in gameplay terms, it isn't a \"great\" CRPG, so this score feels about right.On to Wizard's Crown!"}, {"title": "Ultima IV: Won!", "date": "Saturday, June 12, 2010", "text": "Alas, I cannot seem to find Origin Systems' web site.Well, that was distressingly quick and easy. All that stuff I had written about last time be damned, I decided it was time. Dupre, Shamino, Mariah, and Iolo had achieved level 7, Jaana and Julia level 6, and Katrina level 5. I had decent enough equipment. Time to go forward. I made one last stop at the Bloody Plains to restock on mandrake, figuring on the need for a lot of resurrect spells, then headed for the Island of the Abyss.In a comment on my last posting, Lord Quipworthy noted that I had forgotten about the mystic weapons and armor. I had, but I also remember from past games that you don't really need the mystics in the Abyss. Although it's true that non-magical weapons don't work, magic wands, bows, swords, and so on work fine. Since the mystics are not ranged weapons, there didn't seem to me to be any reason to pick them up.Okay, let's take it step by step. To get to this final dungeon, you'll recall, I had to:Achieve avatarhood in each of the eight virtues by conducting myself in an exemplary manner. This included not cheating blind peddlers, not fleeing from battle, allowing wounded enemies to flee, allowing non-evil creatures to escape battle, answering truthfully when people asked questions, displaying humility when people asked if I was best or greatest at something, giving to beggars, donating hit points at a blood bank, and talking to Hawkwind the Seer frequently to check my progress. I then had to find the runes and learn the mantras for each of the virtues and meditate at their associated shrines.Obtain the bell of courage, book of truth, and candle of love, each hidden at a different location, by getting clues through conversations.Explore the dungeons and find each of the eight stones of virtue, using them in the dungeon altar rooms to obtain the three-part key.Obtain the word of passage of three parts from the lords of the three keeps dedicated to truth, love, and courage.Build up my experience and gold through copious combat; buy decent weapons, armor, and reagents. Mix spells.Learn about the relationships between the virtues and the three principles of virtue.Once I reached the Island of the Abyss, the magic wheel I found on the ruins of the H.M.S. Cape proved fairly useful, increasing my hull strength from 50 to 99. The cove leading into the island, you see, is crawling with pirates.\u00a0 Fortunately, I defeated them all and lined up their ships into a bridge in case I had to return. As it turns out, I didn't.The next stage involved walking through poison and then healing my characters at the end. Amateur stuff.Ultimately, I came to a large patch of lava and had to wade my way in to the center. I used the bell, book, and candle (oddly enough, in that order--you would have thought that it would have gone book, candle, bell--in the order of truth, love, and courage) and the lava parted to reveal the entrance to a dungeon.I entered and immediately tried a spell. In retrospect, I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised that it didn't work.Finding your way through the Abyss is a sometimes difficult process that involves wandering through a variety of rooms until you reach each level's altar. The rooms have a lot of lava and nasty critters. Here, for example, is one of the early ones, full of fire and fire-breathing lizards.Magical mapping gems help a lot. Without this gem on Level 4, I would have wasted a lot of time entering dead-end rooms instead of going through the secret doors.As I said, each level has an altar at which you demonstrate your knowledge of the virtues by answering a fairly simple question, then choosing the correct color stone.This Level 4 room was a bit eerie:This Level 5 room was the most annoying location in the game, full of reapers that cast the \"sleep\" spell over and over and over again. It took about 45 minutes to get through it one slow move at a time. The \"awake\" spell barely helps because they put you to sleep again almost as fast.Level 6 had a series of rooms arranged in a block that formed something of a maze. It took me a while to get through it. Here is one of the rooms--note that nothing connects the east and west sides. Also note that for some strange reason, I'm fighting tornadoes.On Level 7, the rooms got tricky with the secret doors. It took a while to figure out how to open up the walls and get through this room. It didn't help that the balron in the center kept putting me to sleep.Finally, I reached Level 8. In a memorable penultimate room, I found myself face to face with my own party. It was pathetic how quickly the doppelgangers died.At last I reached the final altar and found myself in the Chamber of the Codex, where my three-part key and the password VERAMOCOR gave me access (the image, I emphasize, comes from the XU4 remake, not the original game):A mysterious voice (discussion question: who is the mysterious voice? God? The Codex itself?) began to ask me again of the virtues. Each correct answer filled in part of a symbol.Then suddenly the Xu4 remake failed me. I couldn't get past \"justice\" without it crashing. Fortunately, the save game was transferable to the original. The rest of the screenshots are from the original DOS Ultima IV. To see the difference, here is a shot of one of the dungeon rooms and the altar.I finished answering the questions about the eight virtues. They weren't very difficult because they proceeded in the usual order: honesty, compassion, valor, justice, sacrifice, honor, spirituality, humility. It would be better if the game tricked you a little by asking them out of order.Then there were three questions about the principles of virtue, again presented in the usual order: truth, love, and courage.Finally, the last question. I remember that this caught me off guard when I played Ultima IV as a kid. You find the answer by writing down the letters you see in visions as you achieve your avatarhood in each virtue. I didn't write them down. I also didn't want to go back and do it all again, and there was no Internet at the time, so I called Origin systems and got the answer from a helpful woman on the phone.\u00a0 I still don't fully understand what \"infinity\" has to do with it, but there it is. Having given this final answer....I've always been a little confused about what the Codex actually is. Who created it? Who put it at the bottom of this dungeon? If my quest was to find it, does anyone get to read it afterwards? What does it say? I'm not sure that later Ultimas help much with these questions.The game at this point tells me:The boundless knowledge of the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom is revealed unto thee. The voice says: 'Thou has proven thyself to be truly good in nature. Thou must know that the quest to become an Avatar is the endless quest of a lifetime. Avatarhood is a living gift. It must always and forever be nurtured to flourish. For if thou dost stray from the paths of virtue, thy way may be lost forever. Return now unto thine own world. Live there as an example to thy people, as our memory of thy gallant deeds serves us.Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out, right? I mean, it would have been nice to get some congratulations from Lord British or something. Oh, well. The game continues:As the sound of the voice trails off, darkness seems to rise around you. There is a moment of intense, wrenching vertigo. You open your eyes to a familiar circle of stones. You wonder of your recent adventures. It seems a time and place very distant. You wonder if it really happened. Then you realize that in your hand you hold The Ankh. You walk away from the circle, knowing that you can always return from whence you came, since you now know the secret of the gates. [This is an odd line, given that in all subsequent games the Avatar is explicitly summoned to Britannia, with no evidence that he ever used the gates at-will.]And then it's over. It only took me 82,395 turns and practically two months. Going into it, I thought it might take as little as one long weekend.I believe that the game's exhortations to \"return now unto thine own world\" and \"live there as an example to thy people\" are an honest attempt on the creators' parts (primarily Richard Garriott's part) to instill a codified sense of morality in the players of the game. So I'll tell you what. Here's what I'm going to do tomorrow:Confess to my wife that my PhD program is actually costing 50% more than I originally told her.Call up a friend who's going through a tough time and spend as long on the phone as she wants to talk about it.Give my umbrella to the first person I see walking in the rain without one.Lend some more money through Kiva.That covers honesty, compassion, valor, and sacrifice. Any ideas for honor, justice, spirituality, and humility?Let's do a final ranking for Ultima IV and then, regrettably, move on.See that full ankh cross between my food and gold? Guess what that means! Boo-yah!I had hoped to brave the Stygian Abyss by now, especially since I completed my avatarhood in honesty last night. It took forever. No matter how many times I was honest with the blind herb seller, I couldn't get Hawkwind to give me the thumbs-up. Finally, made a premature trip to the Island of the Abyss so I could cast Mondain's skull into the lava. I remembered from previous games that this ups all of your virtues, and sure enough, when I got back to Lord British's castle, Hawkwind green-lighted my ascension. I am now a full avatar.I have all the other things I need to enter the Abyss: the three-part key, a magic wheel that strengthens my ship's hull, all eight companions, all the stones of virtue, the candle of love, the book of truth, the bell of courage, and the \"word of power\" (forgot to mention this earlier, but at some place you need a password and each of the lords of the three keeps dedicated to truth, love, and courage had part of this password. It's VERAMOCOR).What I lack are:Adequate levels. Katrina is still Level 4. Some of my other characters are 5 and 6. I need to boost their experience before I take on the Abyss.Good weapons and armor. The magic wand, which three of my characters can wield, costs 5000 GP. Magic plate costs 7000. I want the best equipment before I face daemons and dragons.Enough spells and reagents. You can pre-mix up to 99 of each spell and store up to 99 of each reagent. Before I hit the Abyss, I want 99 cure poison spells, 99 heal spells, and 99 dispel field spells, among others, and I want a full complement of reagents. This means not only buying them but hanging out a few months in the middle of a poison swamp and a dark forest so I can pick enough mandrake and nightshade.Enough food. I remember getting stuck on certain levels of the Abyss for hours. My goal is to have at least 2000 meals before I head in.Adequate stats. I want to use the glowing balls to boost my character's stats to as close to the maximum (50) as possible. This means getting them to higher levels first; otherwise, the glowing balls will kill them.To get all of these things, I've been engaging in a prolonged amount of dungeon-crawling, looking for treasure levels and rooms and welcoming combat with everything that moves. During combat, I try to let my less experienced characters make the kill. I forgot to mention this before, I think: in Ultima IV, experience is awarded to individual party members based on who actually strikes the killing blow. This means that Katrina, who only has a paltry sling, hardly ever gets any experience unless I make a special effort by having my other characters withhold attacks.Katrina finishes off a rogue.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 During all of this, I've been taking a look at some things written about Ultima IV on other parts of the web. A few items of note:Ophidian Dragon, the author of Blogging Ultima played through Ultima IV in 2007. For some reason, he waited ages to get party members and seems to have played most of the game with a single character. He shares my frustration with Katrina: \"I know you need all eight party members to get into the Abyss, but I am tempted to just let Katrina the Shepherd die and forget about her, because she's not worth the effort of directing her worthless icon.\" Ouch. He also noted the same thing I did about the location of the Skull of Mondain: \"Who among us ever played Ultima IV and found that extremely suspicious little horseshoe of shoals in the middle of the ocean, and did not sail immediately therein and search?\" As I do, though, he praises Ultima IV for its nonlinearity, and like me he couldn't get anything useful out of Smith the Horse. His blog is full of screen shots from the original DOS version of the game (not XU4, like I'm playing), including one of the after-meditation visions. Check it out here.There's a large community of fans writing mods, updates, and remakes to all of the Ultima games at Ultima: the Reconstruction. Except the last update was more than three years ago, so maybe it's not that active any more.The Literal Ultima has transcripts of what every character says in every Ultima game. Jesus. I went through and scanned them for Ultimas I-III to see what I missed. Apparently I should have bribed the tavern keepers more in Ultima I, because one tells you the entire main quest of the game! I missed Dupre's appearance in Ultima II (he's a \"swashbuckler\" here, not yet a paladin, apparently) on Jupiter. Anyway, I couldn't resist and looked at Joshua's transcript from Ultima IV to see if there was an answer to my question posed here; there wasn't. It also appears that Smith has absolutely nothing useful to say. Why put a talking horse in the game and give it nothing useful to say?There's a nice retrospective on Ultima IV at a blog called the Black Gate, which is nominally about fantasy literature. The author, Ryan Harvey, notes the influence of BADD (\"Bothered about Dungeons & Dragons\"; this is an article worth reading) on the creation of Ultima IV, and what made the game so different. \"Back in 1985, it was a revelation, a game that asked players to live up to a chivalric code--and considering the other games we had played, that was the most intriguing challenge of all.\"I'm predicting a \"won!\" post by tomorrow."}, {"title": "Ultima IV: Dungeons", "date": "Monday, June 7, 2010", "text": "Fighting thieves in the narrow corridors of a dungeon.Dungeons, I have to say, are pretty cool starting in Ultima IV. The game continues the tradition, going back to Akalabeth, of contrasting top-down surface exploration with first-person dungeon exploration. You see doors, chests, and monsters from your characters' eyes.In Ultima I and Ultima II, you engaged in combat from this perspective, too, but starting in Ultima III, when you encounter a monster in a dungeon, you transition to a top-down tactical combat screen. Ultima IV expands upon this by including dungeon \"rooms\" that switch you to third person. The rooms include a lot of varieties of textures, monsters, and items, and many have secret doors. If you want to escape the room to the east, you may have to wander around until you trip the floor plate that opens the eastern wall. (Ultima V will notch up the complexity by having secret doors triggered by attacking walls or objects in the room.) Here are some examples of the various dungeon rooms you find:Monsters around a campfire.Two of my characters had to stand in secret doors to open the passage north.The rat-covered corpse of an unfortunate adventurer.Reapers, which put most of your party to sleep almost every round, are easily the most annoying creatures in the game.In Ultima IV, you must brave the dungeons in order to find six stones associated with each virtue. Eight stones must be used at the end of the game. Six are in the dungeons, but I had to get the white stone of spirituality from a little nook atop a mountain range by flying there on a balloon while judiciously using the \"wind change\" spell, and the black stone of humility was found at the location of a moongate when both moons were dark.Once I had the stones, I had to use them in correct sequence in the altar rooms of truth, love, and courage to get a \"three part key\" I need to enter the Abyss and win the game. This was fairly easy, as each altar room is accessible from the bottom level of the dungeon associated with its virtues. Since spirituality is associated with all three principles of virtue, you can access all three altar rooms from the bottom of the dungeon Hythloth, the antithesis of spirituality.The three-part key is one of several things I need in the Stygian Abyss.Dungeons are also a good place to find treasure. Most of the dungeons have at least one level in which multiple treasure chests are found in the corridors. Dungeons re-set when you exit and return, so a good (if lame) way to quickly build up your finances is to find an easily accessible \"treasure level,\" take all the chests, cast the \"x-it\" spell to leave the dungeon, re-enter (perhaps using the \"z-down\" spell to get back to the level), and repeat. Another strategy is to find a room with lots of chests, and repeatedly exit and re-enter the room. I also found that Xu4 has a bit of a bug: if you take all the chests on a level, save the game, quit the game, and re-load, the chests reappear. This strikes me as cheating, though, so I left that alone.One step closer to a suit of magic plate.Other various points about Ultima IV dungeons:Gremlins are back. These are little food-stealing bastards who can leave you starving. But at least you can face and kill them here, unlike in Ultima III, where you just got a message saying they'd stolen your food and you had no recourse.Revenge for Ultima III!Traps, including pit traps and falling rocks, are rife on some levels. If there's one thing I can't stand in CRPGs, it's unavoidable traps. Ultima IV doesn't give you any way to get past them. you just have to take the damage.Ladders can be tricky. Certain parts of a level may not be accessible from other parts, and you may have to go up and down several ladders before you reach where you're trying to go. Fortunately, peering at gems gives you a map of the level. I don't think it's cheating to take a screen shot of this map and keep it open as I explore, is it?A gem map of Level 8 of the Dungeon Destard.Some of the things that look like chests are actually mimics that start attacking you when you get close.Each dungeon has at least one glowing  ball that, when you touch it, ups your statistics. This is based  on the usual symmetry we've come to expect in Ultima IV. Truth is associated with intelligence,  courage with strength, and love (for reasons that make little sense to  me) with dexterity. So the balls in the dungeon Deceit (the opposite of  honesty, or pure truth) will up your intelligence by 5, while the balls  in the dungeon Shame (the opposite of honor, truth combined with  courage) will up both your intelligence and strength by 5. Like treasure  chests, they reappear if you exit the dungeon and return. But they take  a heavy toll: 200 hit points for every stat they increase. If you're  not careful, you can kill your characters.The glowing ball of intelligence. If Katrina touches it, she will die.My note on strength, dexterity, and intelligence reminds me of something. I hardly ever think about my characters' attributes because combat is frankly quite easy. In my entire time playing Ultima IV, only one of my characters has died, and that was from a succession of traps. Even high-level monsters are dispatched quite quickly, and there are any number of ways (holing up and camping, spells, Lord British, fountains) to restore hit points. I could spend a lot of time exiting and re-entering dungeons to use the balls and build up my stats, but it hardly seems worth it where combat means so little. Combat in general, especially from my ship, is getting rather annoying and repetitive. It is not one of Ultima IV's strong suits.I spent most of today exploring dungeons, finding stones, using them, and getting the three-part key. In other news, I picked up my last companion, Katrina the Shepherd, in Magincia. She's about as useless a character as I can imagine: she starts at Level 1, she can't use most weapons or armor, and can't cast spells. But she's here to remind me of humility. When I played the game as a youth, I pretended that my main character was in love with Katrina, mostly (I think) because I liked the name.I also managed to get partial avatarhood in justice, so I just need honesty. I bought some good weapons and armor for several of my characters--magic wands, magic chain, and such--although it took almost all my gold. I'm pretty sure I just need to get that last bit of avatarhood, to stock up on reagents and guild items, and to fight a bunch of combats to jack up my characters' levels, and then I'm ready for the journey to the Abyss. Look for my next entry to be the \"won!\" posting."}, {"title": "Two Books on CRPG Histories", "date": "Sunday, June 6, 2010", "text": "About a month and a half ago, in response to my posting on Ultima IV and virtue, a reader recommended that I try the book Dungeons & Dreamers (2003) by Brad King and John Borland. While I was ordering it from Amazon, I also purchased Dungeons & Desktops (2008) by Matt Barton, a prolific writer on old games who also maintains a blog. During my month of traveling, I had a lot of plane trips on which to read these books, consider them, and take notes.Barton's book is a methodical and chronological history of CRPGs from their precursors through a few years ago. He divides his history into six \"ages,\" which are quite sensible and useful:The \"Dark Age\" from 1974-1979 when dozens of programmers were writing mini CRPGs for university computer systems.The \"Bronze Age\" from 1979-1983 when commercial CRPGs were getting their legs and figuring themselves out. Akalabeth and Temple of Apshai are exemplars of this era.The \"Silver Age\" from 1983-1985, when the first landmark CRPGs--Wizardry and Ultima among them--appeared.The \"Golden Age\" from 1985-1993, when the number and variety of CRPGs exploded, including The Bard's Tale, Ultima IV, and the D&D \"gold box\" games.The \"Platinum Age\" from 1996-2001, which saw what Barton believes (and I agree) to be the best CRPGs yet designed, including the two Baldur's Gate games and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.The \"Modern Age,\" with an emphasis on high-resolution graphics and a shift to more online multiplayer games.Barton is occasionally dry in his methodical progression through the chronology of games. He describes them fully but rarely stops to consider broader themes and tropes. Except for some skimming and selective jumping around to my favorite games, I decided to stop reading once I caught up to the games I've played so far as part of this blog. I'll probably refer to Barton's book occasionally in future postings as I read his comments on those games.King and Borland's book is in some ways more interesting to read but extremely selective in its material. It's basically a biography of Richard Garriott (the real-life \"Lord British\") with a few stories from other games thrown in. If someone knew nothing about computer gaming and simply read this book, he would think that the history of computer gaming progressed from nothing to the Ultima series to Doom to Quake and then the world was awash in multi-player games. The beginning of the book talks about the development of the paper Dungeons & Dragons RPG but says nothing about CRPGs based directly on D&D. Hundreds of games vital to the development of the genre (Wizardry, Baldur's Gate, the  Elder Scrolls series, Fallout), not to mention hundreds of non-CRPGs (the book presumes to cover every type of game, really) are not mentioned at all. What they do cover, however, is meticulously researched, specific, and valuable.While neither of my brief reviews is exactly a ringing endorsement, I am grateful to both of these books for filling a lot of holes regarding the games I'm playing. Here are some nuggets from them that explain some mysteries of CRPGs I've already reviewed:Barton makes a useful distinction about the difference between CRPGs and regular RPGs: \"It is easy to get carried away and assume that CRPGs are little more than computerized adaptations of D&D. This claim disregards one of the most critical aspects of conventional D&D--namely, the playacting...though it's certainly possible for a CRPG fan to pretend to be his character, even going so far as to dress the part, it is doubtful indeed whether his computer is capable of appreciating these antics\" (p. 23).Given the amount of material he gave to King and Borland, Richard Garriott seems like an honestly cool guy. He comes across that way in his biography, too. This is a man who combined his love for programming and RPGs into a fantastic series of games and got rich enough doing so that he could afford to visit the International Space Station as a tourist. It's too bad his latest endeavors haven't turned out so well.Garriott in his flight suit [source].Lord British got his nickname at computer camp when some boys knocked on his door and he greeted them with a formal \"hello\" instead of a less formal \"hi.\" Coincidentally, he was born in England but had lived in the U.S. since he was a baby (King & Borland, 12).Great quote about the development of an early game called Spacewar! at MIT: \"Tens of millions of dollars in U.S. Department of Defense funding poured into computer research labs at MIT, Carnegie Mellon, and Stanford, earmarked for serious research, while recipients of the funding spend hundreds of hours figuring out better ways to model space battles\" (King & Borland, 26).There was a game called Avatar kicking about university PLATO systems in the 1970s (King & Borland, 29). While the authors don't say this game directly influenced Garriott, it's hard to see how it didn't.An enigmatic character named \"Dr. Cat\" who makes an appearance in a couple of Ultima games is based on a real programmer--just as enigmatic--named David Shapiro (King & Borland, p. 28). Similarly, Dupre, your erstwhile paladin companion from Ultima IV onward, is the Society for Creative Anachronisms nickname for one of  Garriott's friends, Greg Dykes (p. 49); Chuckles the jester is based on  Origin Systems programmer Chuck Bueche (p. 68).Ultima was originally titled Ultimatum but was changed because a board game carried the same title (King & Borland, p. 47). The first Ultima, published by California Pacific Computing, was barely released before the company went bankrupt (p. 50).Garriott had difficulty finding a publisher for Ultima II because he insisted that the game be sold with a cloth map similar to the one that appeared in the film Time Bandits (Barton, p. 66).Garriott was influenced by the success of Wizardry in making sure that Ultima III was a multi-character game. Barton calls Ultima III \"one of the most important CRPGs ever made and the pinnacle of the Silver Age\" (p. 68).The Bard's Tale was the first game series to generate a series of fantasy novels (Barton, p. 93). [Edit from 03/05/2012: I was wrong about this. Barton mentions a successful series of eight novels but does not say that BT was \"the first\".]Garriott conceived Ultima IV after getting a lot of angry letters from Christian groups and concerned parents saying his games were corrupting America's youth. While he didn't really take these seriously, it did get him thinking about adding morality to games, as in previous Ultimas, \"players came into the world, killed virtually everything they saw, stole money from anyone or anything that had it, and walked off with smiles on their faces. Who was really the evil one, after all?\" (King & Borland, p. 73). The principles of virtue--truth, love, and courage--are based on the characters from The Wizard of Oz.The subgenre of \"Rogue-like\" computer games split off from regular CRPGs early, when efforts to sell the game commercially failed due to widespread piracy. To this day, most \"Roguelike\" games are noncommercial (Barton, p. 35).The books have a curious view of the utility and pervasiveness of CRPGs. Consider this quote from Barton:\"CRPGs are not only the most fun and addictive type of computer game, but possibly the best learning tool ever designed. They are truly grand adventures with real rewards for dedicated players\" (p. 3).Despite Barton's attempt to back up this bold statement with quotes from other authors and psychologists, I don't buy it. \"Fun and addictive,\" sure, but not the rest. Look, as I've said before, I'm investing hundreds of hours into this blog and this project, and I more than anyone have a vested interest in believing that what I'm doing isn't just a grand waste of time. But aside from the interesting virtue system of Ultima IV, I can't honestly say that I've \"learned\" much from my time spent in CRPGs--however, this is a topic that I will explore in some detail (and solicit your comments on) later. [Ed. I did!] Similarly, after I finish a marathon night of CRPG gaming, all I have to show for it is bleary eyes and eight undone tasks that I could have done in that time frame. If there are \"real rewards,\" they've yet to show up at my door.King and Borland don't have any quotes quite as provocative, but the subtitle of their book is interesting: \"the rise of computer game culture from geek to chic.\" Again, as much as I'd like to believe that all this gaming is making me hip and stylish, I really don't see this \"rise.\" Speaking about RPGs, King and Borland note that among a culture at  computer camp, \"They shared an implicit understanding that computers, programming, technology, fantasy, and role-playing games were okay. They weren't nerdy, dorky, or strange\" (p. 14). That's great for this subculture, but I think for 75% of the world, gaming--and especially CRPGs--are still nerdy, dorky, and strange.It is partly due to this fact that I have kept myself anonymous on this blog. It's not so much that I care that you know who I am (frankly, I've said enough about my life that a dedicated sleuth could figure it out from my postings) as that I don't want people from my profession stumbling upon this blog and asking how I could possibly have time to play all these games, and write about them, when I'm three months behind on half a dozen projects. If, in contrast, I announced to my boss that I planned to spend all weekend watching sports, or kayaking, or attending a rock concert, I would not get the same comment because these activities are \"normal.\" First-person shooters and console games are slightly more respectable in the real world than CRPGs, but not a lot.I'm not trying to dis CRPGs. I'm addicted to them, I play them a lot, and I love writing about them, but I just can't agree with these authors' contentions that they are teaching me anything, providing any real rewards, or socially acceptable. If I could force myself to give them up and spend as much time practicing the piano, I would.Well...if I could force myself to give up half the time, maybe.\"I don't know, guys...do you think something might be hidden in that dark square amidst three volcanoes?\"The key to the main quest of Ultima IV is becoming an Avatar of Virtue: a living embodiment of the eight virtues in the game's philosophical system. These, again, are honesty, compassion, valor, justice, honor, sacrifice, spirituality, and humility. Under the hood somewhere, the game keeps tally of how well you're doing in each of these virtues. You can't see the actual score, but you can visit the Seer Hawkwind in Lord British's castle and ask. His responses seem to run the gamut of saying that you're horrible to saying you're ready for advancement.Not quite ready for advancement in honesty.Your virtue points depend on how you interact with the world. The game provides a few options to excel, or not, in each virtue. For instance, to prove your honesty, the game has its various characters ask you questions (\"are you the Avatar?\") and provides you with the ability, should you desire, to cheat the blind herb sellers. There are real temptations to be unvirtuous. You have to force yourself to let fleeing orcs leave the battlefield, for instance, instead of trying to squeeze every last experience point out of them. You have to ignore piles and piles of treasure chests. You have to pay full price for expensive reagents. You have to avoid using a powerful magic item that instantly slaughters your enemies. You have to resist killing Chuckles.Show enough dedication to a specific virtue, and Hawkwind eventually tells you to go meditate at the shrine of that virtue for three cycles, at which point you obtain an \"eighth\"; that is, you become an Avatar of that virtue, and a little piece of the ankh cross shows up in the game window. When you have attained all of the eighths, you are a full Avatar. However, you can \"lose an eighth\" by acting unvirtuously, forcing you to start over. Using the skull of Mondain to slaughter your enemies, incidentally, causes you to lose all of your eighths. Frankly, I was hard-pressed to see how using the skull is a sin against honesty, but then I remembered that in order to get the coordinates for the skull, you had to promise never to use it except to cast it into the fires of the Abyss.And it didn't even kill Lord British. Lord British is invulnerable in this game, it seems. (I quit without saving and re-loading after trying. You have to try at least once.)Let's get back to the shrines. There are eight of them, of course, usually located near the towns that exemplify their virtues. The \"odd one out\" is the shrine of humility, which is surrounded by daemons and requires you to use a special silver horn if you don't want to fight waves and waves of them. The shrine of spirituality isn't located on Britannia but is accessed by entering a moongate when both moons are full. These are clues I picked up from NPCs in towns, of course.There are good reasons to visit the shrines and meditate even if you're not ready for avatarhood. I'm pretty sure doing so increases your spirituality, and you get clues as to what types of things to do and not do to achieve that virtue. In order to meditate a shrine, though, you need to have picked up the rune for that shrine as well as the virtue's mantra.Thanks for the tip.When you meditate, a progress bar slowly slides across the screen. This theoretically gives you time, although not much, to meditate for real on the associated virtue. I was thinking about honesty the other day, for instance. What does it mean to truly be \"honest?\" I think most people define it as simply the avoidance of literal lies. For instance, a few weeks ago I engaged in an all-night poker game. The next morning, my wife asked how I did. I told her, \"After about three hours of playing, I was up about $250, so I quit the game to just socialize with other people\" (there were other people at this party not playing poker). While this is literally true, what is also true is that after about an hour of socializing, I rejoined the game, now significantly more intoxicated, and proceeded to lose everything I'd won plus about $150 more. I was congratulating myself for not having told a \"lie\" because, after all, it isn't lying to simply exclude part of the story. But of course it is. It's as dishonest to let someone believe something untrue through evasion as it is to tell a bald-faced lie. I don't know that this would have occurred to me in such stark terms if I hadn't been thinking about honesty in general. To be fair, this didn't all occur during the time it took the progress bar to reach the other end of the screen, but still.\u00a0 Assuming you're ready for advancement, meditating three times will gain you partial avatarhood in that virtue and grants you a vision. This is one of the areas in which the makers of XU4 really shine. I'm pretty sure the original version just has you seeing a single letter of Britannia's runic alphabet (something I'll try to remember to cover in a future posting), and you have to piece these together in the right order to get a word that wins the game. But the XU4 team replaced this simple screen with a more artistic image of the avatar doing something that exemplifies the virtue. Here, for instance, are compassion, spirituality, and humility:In today's playing, I finished gathering some special items, including a magic ship's wheel that strengthens the hull of my frigate and makes it more resistant to other ships' cannonades. I was assured by someone in...Buccaneer's Den, I think...that I would need this to get to the Abyss. I also picked up the silver horn to get to the shrine of humility.My main character has achieved Level 8, which means I can go pick up my last companion: Katrina the Shepherd.I've achieved avatarhood in six of the eight virtues, but I'm having trouble with justice and honesty. Justice is a tough one, because it involves letting non-evil creatures escape without killing them, which means carefully monitoring their health. Honesty I can't figure out: I've talked to pretty much everyone in the game and always answered straight. Maybe I need to spend more time with the blind reagent seller...One final note: In a stop at Paws to find food, I realized there was a person in the middle of a horse stall I hadn't spoken to before. I jimmied my way through some doors to get to her and had to fight a bull. Anyway, she suggested that one of the horses could talk, and sure enough there is a talking horse named Smith in the middle of the field. I think he appears in later Ultimas as well. Problem is, I can't get him to tell me anything. I assume if you put a talking horse in a game like this, he has something to offer, but no terms seem to prompt anything. Give me a clue if you have one.Why is he here?My next posting will be about dungeons. After I've finished them, assuming I can get partial avatarhood in the last two virtues, it's off to the Abyss and the end of the game!"}, {"title": "Ultima IV and Magic", "date": "Friday, June 4, 2010", "text": "The awesome Ultima IV Book of Mystic Wisdom page for the \"turn undead\" spell.Quick: what game am I describing? In this game, your character has a certain number of \"hit points\" that increase as you become more powerful. Enemies' weapons and spells, poison, and sometimes falls and other accidents damage your \"hit points.\" The game provides spells, potions, and other items that help you regain them, and you can always regain them by waiting or resting. If your \"hit points\" fall too low, your character dies.Anyone? If you guessed Wizardry, you're right. Of course, you're also right if you guessed Phantasie, the Bard's Tale, Ultima III, Morrowind, Baldur's Gate, Diablo, Might and Magic II, or just about any CRPG in existence. Among all CRPGs, there is extremely little variation in the way the game treats your health. In a posting a few months ago, I talked about hit points as the glue that holds all CRPGs--indeed, all RPGs--together. \"If anyone ever makes a movie about CRPGS,\" I said and still maintain, \"They ought to call it Hit Points.\"Systems of weapons and armor are also remarkably similar across RPGs. Certain weapons do more damage than others. Certain armors protect more. Some weapons and armor you buy, some you can find in the game. There are both ranged and melee weapons. Different classes can wield and wear different weapons and armor. And so on. Very little variation from this basic template from game to game.Now contrast this with magic systems. Fully describe the magic system of any game, and there's a decent chance that your description applies only to that game, or at least only to games in that series. The ways in which CRPGs vary magic are astounding. Think of all the different dimensions involved:Spell acquisition: Some games allow players to cast every spell from the outset, provided they have enough magic points (Ultima III) or can afford them (Ultima I); others require you to achieve certain levels to acquire spells (Wizardry); still others require you to find or purchase the spells in-game to make them part of your spellbook (the Dungeons & Dragons games, at least to some extent).The spell book in Might and Magic VII.  I'll get there eventually. The game requires you to find or purchase spells to populate your book. As you cast them, your magic points (the blue bar next to the character portrait) decrease.Spell limits: In some games, there are no practical limitations to the number of spells that you can cast (Ultima I); in some, you can cast a certain number per level (Wizardry; sorcerer classes in D&D games); in some, you have a certain number per level and you must memorize them first (most classes in D&D games); and in some, you have a pool of \"spell points\" or \"mana\" that depletes depending on the strength of the spell (Might and Magic VI; Morrowind). In these games, your spell points may be dependent on your attributes alone (Ultima III), your level alone, or your level multiplied by your attributes. In a few rare games, spells exist only in scrolls or potions that are depleted as you use them.Spell regeneration: Some games require you to rest to recharge your spell points or renew your access to spell levels (D&D games); some regenerate continually as you walk around (Oblivion). Games of the latter type might have potions that help restore your spell points (Might and Magic VI-VIII).Spell access: In some games, you access your spells by selecting them from a \"spell book\" (Ultima VII), while some require you to type the name of the spell (Wizardry) or a letter or numeric code (Might and Magic I).In the Wizardry series, you must know a spell's name, plus have the appropriate spell level, to cast it.Character limitations: In some games, every character can cast at least some spells (Morrowind; Oblivion); in others, there are non-magic-using characters who can cast no spells (D&D games). Usually games of the former type give more spell access to certain classes.Physical objects: Some games require physical objects, like talismans and reagents, to cast spells, regardless of levels or magic points (Ultima IV-VII); others depend solely on innate ability.Spell stratification: Most games make at least a distinction between arcane and divine spells (D&D games), but some do not (Ultima IV). In some games, there are further distinctions, with spell schools like necromancy and illusion (D&D games) or alteration and conjuration (Elder Scrolls games). These games vary as to what types of spells are available to which classes. Custom spells: Most games restrict you to a list of pre-defined spells, but a few (e.g., Oblivion) allow you to create custom spells that combine various pre-defined spell effects.Items as spell proxies: Many games provide magic items, like wands and scrolls, that have the same effect as spells (The Bard's Tale); others use spells for all of their magic (Ultima IV).Magic as a requirement: In a few games, you cannot progress in the game without the ability to cast certain spells (e.g., Phantasie and the teleport spell that takes you to the city of the gods); in some, spells are essentially superfluous--you could just as easily play the game with fighters only (Ultima II). There are many that occupy a middle ground where magic is theoretically optional but, unless you want an extreme challenge, functionally necessary.I'm sure I've missed a few of the facets of magic systems in this brief list (please comment if you can think of any more), but the overall point is that the various combinations of these elements create unique magic systems for each game. Occasionally you find game series  that are consistent in their uses of magic (D&D games of the same editions; Might & Magic VI-VIII; Wizardry I-III), but very often even series are inconsistent in the way they treat magic. The Ultima series is probably the most egregious offender here. If I recall correctly:In Ultima I and Ultima II, you buy spells and can cast them until you run out.Visiting the spell store in Ultima IIn Ultima III, your characters have different numbers of spell points depending on their class. Spells are divided into priest and wizard classes. You cast them by specifying the associated letter. Spell points recharge as you move around, at different rates depending on class.In Ultima IV, all characters have access to the same spells. There are 26, one for each letter of the alphabet. Spell points are dependent on your intelligence and a multiplier based on your class (but not on your level). To cast spells, you must first \"mix\" them using reagents which you must buy and find (more below). Spell points regenerate as you walk around and sleep.Ultima V (this is to the best of my recollection) works like Ultima IV except that there are many more spells. Spells are based on syllables (\"AN\" for negate; \"NOX\" for poison; \"IN\" for creation), and you cast them by combining the right syllabus (e.g., \"AN NOX\" would be cure poison, but \"IN NOX\" would cause an enemy to become poisoned). You need your reagents, but I can't remember if you have to mix them first.Ultima VI and VII, on the other hand, use spell books. You must first find or buy spells and put them in your book before you can cast them. You still need your reagents, but these just deplete automatically as you cast the spells.In the Ultima Underworld games, you have a pool of \"mana\" that depletes as you cast spells. The syllable system is back, but you need the correct rune to use each syllable. There are no reagents.Spell runes and mana (the blue potion bottle) in Ultima UnderworldI never played Ultima VIII or Ultima IX, so I don't know how they differ, but the overall point is that every Ultima introduces a new twist in the magic system.Let me explore Ultima IV's magic system in a little more depth. The first thing that's important to know is that spells are almost completely optional. There are a couple of characters you cannot talk to, and a few places you can't go, unless you can cast \"dispel field,\" and I suppose you'd die a lot without the \"cure poison\" spell, but otherwise you don't really need magic. I'm about half way through the game already and I've yet to cast a single offensive spell.As I mentioned, to cast spells you must first \"mix\" them using the appropriate reagents. As with everything else in the game, there are eight of them: sulphurous ash, ginseng, garlic, spider silk, blood moss, black pearl, nightshade, and mandrake. The first six can be readily bought from different magic shops around Britannia, but the latter two (necessary for the most powerful spells) you must \"find\" in the wilderness. A series of characters give you hints as to where they can be found, and ultimately you need a sextant to find the coordinates for the specific location of nightshade, while you can only collect mandrake by standing on a particular patch of poison. You can only pick them when the dual moons are dark, so amassing a lot of either is quite difficult.Finding mandrake--and getting nice and poisoned (it grows in a patch of it)The game is ingenious with the specific uses of the reagents. Rather than just require a random selection of reagents for each spell, the reagents each have specific purposes, floridly described in The Book of Mystic Wisdom. For instance, the book has this to say about ginseng: \"Long praised for its strength-giving and medicinal properties, the root of the ginseng plant is immediately recognizable for its forked shape, and to those initiated in the mystic ways, by its overpowering rose-colored aura. It has been used for centuries by peasants who chew it or brew tea from a powdered preparation of the root in order to gain strength and stamina as they toil in the fields.\" This is all fluff, of course, as you never actually \"see\" the ginseng in the game (there's no icon for it), but still fun to read.So ginseng is required for healing, sulphurous ash for fire and \"flash,\" garlic for warding (illness or beings), spider silk for binding, blood moss for movement,  black pearl for projectiles, nightshade for poison and illusion, and mandrake for general power. Thus, the \"cure poison\" spell requires a combination of healing and warding (ginseng + garlic), while \"fireball\" requires fire and projectile magic (ash + black pearl), and the powerful \"negate time\" spell requires a bit of flash, some warding (of time, I guess), and a lot of power (ash + garlic + mandrake). Genius. For a few spells, the book does not give you the ingredients, or gives you incorrect ingredients, and you must find out the right combination through experimentation or from NPCs.Once you mix a batch of spells, you have them in your reserve to cast them when you need them, provided you have enough magic points. The game is a bit vague on how many points are needed for each spell, so it's been a bit of trial and error. So far, the most useful spells for me have been the aforementioned \"cure poison\" and \"dispel field\" plus one that allows you to exit a dungeon immediately.As I said, there are 26 spells--one for each letter of the alphabet--and 23 of them begin with a sensible letter, so they're easy to remember: (c)ure poison, (f)ireball, (l)ight, and so on. The three exceptions are the three dungeon movement spells, which are (x)it, (y)up, and (z)down. The Book of Mystic Wisdom has some fun with the fact that these don't follow the pattern: \"The most elementary forms of transportation both have strange names and may be used only when underground. The more difficult of the two is known by the letter 'Y' in honor of the mage Yenthak Gnor, who first crafted the enchantment... The origin of the [name for the (z)down spell] is uncertain, but it is believed that the letter 'Z' is the first letter of the unpronounceable Truename of the Lord of the Underworld, a demon of much power.\"Now, this wouldn't be Ultima IV if there wasn't a virtue angle to the spell system, and it comes when you purchase your spell reagents. For some reason, all of the reagent vendors in Britannia are blind. You go to buy garlic for 4 gold pieces a clove, specify that you want 10 cloves, and the seller asks for 40gp. The game then gives you the option to pay whatever you want. Cheat her, and your honesty (and perhaps some other virtues) suffers; overpay and your compassion and sacrifice go through the roof.The Avatar does not cheat blind womenOn to my own Ultima IV game: I've finished visiting all the cities, towns, and keeps, collecting mantras and runes, and finding clues. I bought a sextant (which allows you to identify your coordinates) and used it to collect the bell of courage, the book of truth, and the candle of love, which I need at some point to enter the Abyss. I also hauled Mondain's skull from the depths of the ocean--this is a powerful item that will instantly kill all your enemies, and everyone else in the area, but at the cost of all your virtue. An NPC told me the only virtuous way to use it is cast it in the lava outside the Abyss.I spent a lot of time on bridges fighting trolls and gathering enough gold to purchase a decent number reagents. I also went and gathered a little nightshade and mandrake although I've yet to mix any spells that require them.The seer Hawkwind in Lord British's castle tells me I'm ready for avatarhood in a few virtues, so my next step is to travel around and meditate the shrines. After that, it's time to hit the dungeons--I've got my eye on a magic wand and magic bow at the weapons shop in Buccaneer's Den, but I need piles of gold for both. In my next posting, I'll talk about shrines, meditation, and avatarhood."}, {"title": "Ultima IV: Travel", "date": "Sunday, May 30, 2010", "text": "My Ultima IV gameplay today mirrored the last four weeks of my real life: I traveled all over the world and visited a bunch of different cities. Of course, in real life I did it by airplane instead of by pirate ship.I got some immediate luck as I started playing, encountering a pirate ship nearly immediately. So many locations in Ultima IV are accessible only by ship--Buccaneer's Den, the town of Cove, the island of the Abyss--that having one is absolutely essential. But I forgot how much of a pain in the neck it is to fight from them, especially if your characters don't have missile weapons. There are only a couple of points from which you can attack.When cannons fail...My ship gets attacked by creatures constantly--much more often than I remember from earlier Ultima IV plays. The battles are annoying because water creatures don't drop any treasure and, being non-evil, you're not really supposed to kill them anyway.Nonetheless, between ships and moongates, today I visited the rest of the eight major Ultima IV towns and the four minor villages (Buccaneer's Den, Cove, Vesper, and Paws). Some notes from a few of these towns:Moonglow:Continuing our analysis of famous quotes, I have met a wizard in Moonglow named Shakespeare who tells me that \"corruption wins not more than honesty!\" This, of course, is a quote from Shakespeare's Henry VIII. In the play, the line is delivered by Thomas Woolsey, and the full quote is: \"Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee; Corruption wins not more than honesty.\" This has implications for several of the Ultima IV virtues.An old gypsy named Inoo tells me that my destiny is to descend into the Abyss and read the codex.I learn that Nigel at the Lycaeum knows the \"recall\" (also known as \"resurrect\" spell). This is important because the Book of Mystic Wisdom does not give you the reagent combination for this spell.A sleep spell requires only one part spider silk. The book says you need two. The blue stone of honesty is in the dungeon Deceit (note how the dungeon names always suggest the opposite of the associated virtue: compassion = Despise; honor = Shame; etc.)A paladin named Cromwell tells me that the mantra of honesty is AHM. He also tells me that \"a few honest men are better than numbers,\" which of course is a real Oliver Cromwell quote and fits perfectly with the Henry VIII theme established by Shakespeare. Wow, am I glad I started looking these things up.A wizard named Rebelias tells me to \"speak the truth and shame the evil forces.\" This is a paraphrase of a quote from the French author Francois Rabelais: \"speak the truth and shame the devil.\"There are a bunch of chests in a room occupied by a \"starving journalist\" named Tracie. I do not steal them because this would be dishonest. Tracie wants to quit smoking. I assume this is an in-joke of some kind.I meet a jester named Dekker, probably an allusion to Thomas Dekker, another Elizabethan dramatist. A little Googling also informs me that there is a character named John Dekker in Origin's Wing Commander. I hope no one is getting sick of this kind of thing, because I find it a lot of fun. The mage Mariah joins me.Yew:There's a kid named \"Short Round\" who works for \"Jones.\"I ask Calumny about mandrake, and he tells me it can only be found in the Fens of the Dead or on the Bloody Plains. I seem to recall never being able to find it in the Fens in previous games.By being honest about having committed crimes, I got a clue as to the location of the rune of Justice: in a cell in the jail with a criminal.The mantra of justice is BEHJaana the Druid doesn't join me because I'm not experienced enough. I had forgotten that you're limited in your number of companions by your level. I'm level 4. Having already picked up Shamino, Iolo, and Mariah, I will need to wait until I level up before I can collect anyone else.Finding the rune of justice in the cell of a violent criminal. Irony.Buccaneer's DenVisited the guild and bought a slew of torches, gems (they allow you to automap areas), and keys (for jimmying locked doors).MaginciaMagincia was founded on the non-virtue of pride and was destroyed by daemons for its sins. This has always been a bit of a mystery to me. Why would daemons care that a city was proud? This is especially puzzling given what we found out about daemons in Ultima VI.The rune was banished from the city. I should ask Barren in PawsI need a silver horn to pass the daemons guarding the shrine of humility on the north bank of the isle of the Abyss. I can find out about the horn from the Queen of Love's lady-in-waiting. Presumably this is in Empath Abbey.I finished off the day with a visit to the town of Cove, where I talked to a seahorse and an inanimate ankh as well as Paul and Linda McCartney spouting some nonsense about teaching children songs of joy. There is also a man named Rabindranath Tagore, named after the Indian writer, who issues one of the real Tagore's quotes: \"In love, all of life's contradictions dissolve and disappear,\" a line used by--you guessed it--Paul McCartney.My plan for the rest of the game now looks something like this:Visit the Lycaeum, Empath Abbey, and Serpent's Hold (the three keeps devoted to the principles of virtue: truth, love, and courage).Re-visit each of the major towns, collecting all of the mantras and runes, resolving clues I got in other towns, jimmying doors that I previously found locked, and dispelling fields blocking my path to characters or places.Pray at each of the shrines.Visit each of the dungeons and collect the stones.Do any other items on my list before the end game.Descend into the Abyss.In my next post, I'll discuss the magic system. In the meantime, here's a role-playing question. You're sailing along and you come across something like the image below. Clearly something is to be found in that little patch of water, but so far I haven't received any hints--I just happened to stumble on it. Do you search anyway, or wait for the appropriate hint?"}, {"title": "Ultima IV in Flash", "date": "Sunday, May 30, 2010", "text": "Almost a month ago, a reader named Blair Leggett posted a comment to one of my Ultima IV postings indicating that he had created a Flash version of Ultima IV and posted it online. At the time I read it, this seemed so wildly improbable that I didn't give it much thought, although I mentally filed it to check it out when I had a free moment.The CRPG Addict in a rare free moment.Blair, I apologize. I shouldn't have doubted you. The effort you have put in to the recreation of this game is nothing short of incredible. I encourage anyone interested in playing this classic game to skip downloading and installing it, and simply go to Blair's site:http://www.phipsisoftware.com/ultima4/Ultima4.htmlBlair's contributions don't end with the game itself. He has also posted clean PDF versions of the History of Britannia and the Book of Mystic Wisdom (the spellbook), which I will be using throughout the rest of my playing. Finally, don't forget to visit his blog at...http://interactivevisions.blogspot.com...to learn about the development of the project.I think it says something about the richness of the plots and quests in the Ultima series that fans are so eager to remake the games. This page catalogs a host of attempts by different developers--some completed, some still in progress--to update Ultima IV and other games in the series to modern operating systems, graphics, and sound. There are several remakes using the Neverwinter Nights engine. I would sacrifice an eighth* for a version using the Infinity engine (from Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale).Blair, thanks for reading, and thanks for all your work in perpetuating this excellent game.*That was the geekiest thing I've ever said.

Here I learned:Some artifact of Mondain (from Ultima I) still exists in the world. Presumably it's his skull, since I must ask about the \"skull\" at the pub in Buccaneer's Den.I can boost my compassion by giving money to beggars. Britain helpfully supplies one: a beggar named Sprite, who in return for 5 gold pieces told me to ask Pepper of the rune.The yellow stone is in the dungeon DespiseMagincia was destroyed by daemons for its pride (always a bit of a mystery; who sent them, and why did they care that the city was proud?)The mantra for the Shrine of Compassion is MUThe rune of compassion is at the end of a hallway (this from a \"spicy woman\" named Pepper)I also picked up good ol' Iolo, who was playing a mandolin for some children while his wife, Gweno, danced. Of course, Ultima IV doesn't tell you that they're married (you learn that in V or VI, I think), nor even that Iolo is a male (as a young Ultima IV player, I was confused about this for years).I feel really bad for killing these two in Ultima I and Ultima II.After Britain, I returned to Lord British's castle for some healing and both Americus and Shamino leveled. I forgot that Lord British did that for you. I was thinking you had to hole up and camp and he would appear in your dreams to level you, but now I'm thinking that's Ultima V.Yes, this short posting represents only about 20 minutes of playing time, but I am back and I'll post longer tomorrow. Thanks to everyone for hanging in there, and I hope I can recapture your regular readership."}, {"title": "Ultima IV: Battle and Exploration", "date": "Monday, May 3, 2010", "text": "Is there any CRPG that doesn't have orcs?Since I last wrote, I have visited the cities of Skara Brae, Trinisc, and Paws, collecting clues and hints. My to do list has already grown fairly long. I've organized it by town when I knew the town:JHELOM: doors to jimmy, ask in pub of sextantsLORD BRITISH CASTLE: Find secret entrance to dungeons, jimmyMINOC: Ask Zircon about mystic armsSKARA BRAE: Return with keys to jimmy doorsTRINSIC: Ask of the white stone at the tap, return with dispel field spellVESPER: Ask barkeep about nightshadeAsk at the Folley Tavern of mandrakeAsk Hermit Sloven near Lock Lake of white stoneCalumny: Ask about MandrakeLock Lake, reachable only by ship: ask Mentorian of gate travel spellI also fought my first Ultima IV battle, against four orcs. Fortunately, I had picked up Shamino in Skara Brae, so I wasn't alone. Shamino and I survived and, just as importantly, so did two of the orcs. In this game, you allow fleeing enemies to get away, thus satisfying the dictates of honor. This battle was followed by a few fights against trolls, who attacked when I crossed their bridges. I had forgotten about that. Standing on bridges and hitting the spacebar (pass) provides nearly endless troll fights. Chests, unfortunately, are almost always trapped, and with no thief class in Ultima IV, I can't open them safely until I mix up a number of open chest spells.Battle in Ultima IV is basically identical to Ultima III. When you switch to a battle screen, you control each of your companions individually in turn. They can attack, maneuver about, used ranged weapons, and cast spells (if you have any prepared). One new feature in Ultima IV is how the battle landscape changes depending on the terrain you were on when battle is initiated. The type of terrain can offer advantages and disadvantages. For instance, moutainous terrain, shown below, provides obstacles that prevent multiple enemies from attacking at once.The game manual notes helpfully: \"a few valiant fighters strategically placed in a narrow rocky pass can stand off an army numbered in the thousands.\"With Shamino plus the game map, I figured I had enough role-playing cause to make my way to Lord British's castle. I forgot how tough it is to find your way around this game at the beginning stages. The moongates take you near towns, but Skara Brae, Jhelom, Moonglow, and Magincia are all on islands, and the moongate near Minoc is surrounded by poisonous swamp. Finally, through trial and error I found myself near Trinsic and managed to make my way up the coast to Britain and the castle.After briefly exploring the castle, I visited the throne room, bribed Lord British for hit points, killed his jester, and looted his treasury. No! Those are the other Ultima games. Instead, I had a very civil conversation with him. He clarified that my quest involves becoming an earthly manifestation of each of the eight virutes, and clued me in (if I didn't know already) about the associations of the towns to the classes to the virtues. Once I become an Avatar, he says, I can brave the Great Stygian Abyss and view the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This bears repeating: the final goal of the game is not to kill an evil wizard, overthrow a tyrant, or retrieve a magic amulet, but to read a book of wisdom.Lord British is helpful for once.I talked in my last post about the symmetry in this game, and it manifests in a few ways that I forgot. First, the eight virtues derive from three principles of virtue--truth, love, and courage--in various combinations. Valor is pure courage, but honor is a combination of truth and courage, for instance. The Venn diagram below shows the relationships. More on humility in a second.\u00a0 Each principle of courage has primary color associated with it, and the combinations of colors determine the color of the stone (which I have to find in the dungeons) associated with each virtue. Red (pure courage) is the stone of valor, and blue (pure truth) is the stone of honesty, so purple (truth + courage) must be the stone of honor.The number eight also appears in other ways: since there are eight virtues and eight associated classes, your party can have a maximum of eight characters. Each character can reach a maximum of level 8. There are eight spell reagents, eight phases of the moon, eight types of armor to wear...oh, and probably a dozen more incarnations that I haven't spotted yet. But the symmetry is even more notable for the fact that things don't really occur in series of eight: they occur in seven plus one. What I mean by this is that for every group of eight, there's always an odd one out: something that's not like the others. The virtue of humility, for instance, does not derive from the principles of virtue; it exists outside of them. Its associated class, a shepherd, is almost worthless as an adventurer and makes you wonder why the class exists. Humilty's town, Magincia, is unique among the towns as not being really about the virtue of humility; instead, it was founded on pride (not a virtue) but then destroyed by demons. There are eight dungeons, but one of them is the Great Stygian Abyss, which is fairly unique. Most of the stones are found in dungeon altar rooms but one, of them, the white stone of spirituality, is missing. Nightshade is unique among reagents in that it can only be found in a single place, and one of the eight types of armor you have to find through a quest. This is a meticulously planned game.Again, thanks to the Internet, I've found something I never knew about Ultima IV. The creators include NPCs named after familiar famous philosophers and writers, which was obvious. But I didn't realize until I did a little Googling that they used those individuals' actual quotes in the dialog. For instance, a philosopher in Skara Brae named \"Buddha\" says that, \"if one speaks or acts with pure thought, happiness will follow like a shadow that never leaves,\" a quote actually attibuted to Buddha. A ranger named Michaelangelo says, \"May thou always desire more than thou can accomplish!,\" a paraphrase of a real Michaelangelo quote: \"Lord, grant that I may always desire more than I can accomplish.\" The game seamlessly works these adages in to the dialog so that the casual gamer is none the wiser.Now here's a riddle for all of you who have played Ultima IV before: when exploring Lord British's castle, I came across a mage named Joshua who asked, \"If the eight philosophies of avatarhood combine into and are made from truth, love, and courage, what one thing creates and is created by all truths, all love, and all courage?\" I have no idea what he's talking about, and any potential answer I could think to give returned a \"that I cannot help thee with.\" I don't remember this guy at all from my previous Ultima IV adventures. Any idea what he's going on about? If you do, give me a hint--not the answer!My plan right now is to make my way around the continent, visiting the towns and keeps on the Britannian mainland, fighting creatures when I encounter them, until I can either commandeer or afford a ship. I will then visit the cities and towns in order and obtain the runes and mantras for each virtue. Before my next posting, I'll see if I can afford a few reagents so I can talk about the magic system."}, {"title": "Ultima IV: Towns and Dialog", "date": "Sunday, May 2, 2010", "text": "Pressing (z)tats is one of the only ways to pause the game. I'm not obsessed with myself.As I mentioned recently, I last played Ultima IV ten years ago. Despite this, I still remember all of the virtues, which classes are associated with which virtues, and which towns are associated with which classes. I also remember the towns' basic locations and which companion I can pick up in each one.There is a lot I do not remember, however, such as the locations of shrines and dungeons, the mantras for each shrine, the locations of the runes needed to enter the shrines, the specific things I have to do to achieve each virtue, the layouts of the towns, and all the things I must collect before the endgame. I also have trouble distinguishing in my memory between features of Ultima IV and later Ultimas--particularly Ultima V. (Which has the magic carpet? And in which do secret doors appear as barely-perceptible breaks in walls?) This is a good balance between remembrance and forgetfulness, and I only wish I could forget this much about Baldur's Gate. Maybe by the time I reach it again, I will.The basic gameplay of Ultima IV is nearly identical to Ultima III, featuring a top-down perspective; a \"tile-based\" world with different physical features like trees, grass, and water; keyboard commands to do everything from (a)ttack to (j)immy a lock to (t)alk. The (z)tats key shows you your character statistics, which are strength, dexterity, and intelligence (wisdom was apparently jettisoned after Ultima III, as there is no longer a distinction between priest and mage spells). I was wrong in my last posting that my character starts with no equipment: I have an axe and a suit of leather armor. Ultima IV continues Ultima III's conventions of experience, levels, and magic points. As a fighter, I have none of the latter.Ultima IV: Stats of the AvatarSince I have begun the game on an island, there isn't much to do but enter the nearby city, see what I can figure out, and hopefully buy some equipment. This is the city of Jhelom, home to fighters; the game starts you near the city that exemplifies the character class you chose.I wander through the streets and begin my first dialogs with NPCs. This is where Ultima IV really stands out. In Ultima II and Ultima III, you could talk to dozens of NPCs but they only had one thing to say, like \"DIG FOR EXOTICS\" and \"KILL MINAX WITH THE QUICKSWORD!\" Just as often they'd say something useless like \"UGH, ME TOUGH\" and \"PSST, WANT TO BUY A WATCH?\" In Ultima IV, by contrast, NPCs have lots more to say, and almost all of it is useful. Furthermore, the way in which you communicate with NPCs is completely unique: you type the keywords you want to talk about. (Aside from Ultimas IV-VI, I know no other game that has this interface.)My first conversation occurs a little way along the main street of Jhelom. I (t)alk to a fighter walking by, and the game tells me \"you meet a valiant warrior. He says: I am Slithe,\" and then gives me a command prompt at which I may type key words to further our conversation. As I remember from previous experiences playing the game, NAME, HEALTH, and JOB are the three words that nearly everyone responds to. (I remember that Ultima VII has a bit of fun with this by staging a play that suggests these are the only words the Avatar ever spoke.) This is how my conversation with Slithe proceeds:HEALTH: \"Only minor wounds!\"JOB: \"I fight battles!\"BATTLES: \"True valor is seen not in the force of arms, but in the force of will! Art thou valiant?\"YES: \"Then never flee unless the need is dire!\"A few other tries at conversation elicit the response, \"That I cannot help thee with,\" so I end with a BYE. Granted, not the most verbose of conversations in a CRPG, but already he's given me more information than an entire town in Ultima III, and as much as almost all NPCs combined in Wizardry or The Bard's Tale. Most important, I've learned something about how to achieve the \"valor\" part of my avatarhood: never flee from battle.As you can see, the NPC's own responses help determine what keywords to use. Here's another:\"You meet a ranger with a far away look.\"NAME: \"I am Luke.\"HEALTH: \"Quite well.\"JOB: \"I seek the inner light!\"LIGHT: \"I come from Skara Brae and am on my way to Yew. Hast thou been to Skara Brae?\"NO: \"'Tis a spiritual city!\"YEW: \"'Tis a city based on the virtue of justice!\"Now, if I didn't already know these things, this conversation would be quite helpful. In subsequent conversations, I learn of a red stone in the dungeon Destard, that I'll need to use that stone in an altar room to get \"the third part of a key,\" and that I should stand my ground against non-evil creatures but try not to kill them. Throughout these conversations, there are a few chances to display or not display certain virtues. For instance, an enigmatic fighter named X asks me if I am the avatar. Since I am not, yet, I must say \"no\" or risk a blow to my honesty. Another character asks if I am \"the most valiant of souls.\" To say \"yes\" would show a lack of humility.Dialog is one of the most important features of Ultima IV.Although most of the conversations in Ultima IV occur via prompts that you get from dialog, occasionally one character will tell you to ask another about a subject that you wouldn't have normally thought to ask about. For instance, at one point I meet a fighter named Hrothgar who tells me that another character named Aesop knows the mantra of valor. You would normally never get this from Aesop, a timid man hiding in the woods who questions his own bravery, but having been forewarned, you can mention MANTRA to him and find out that the mantra of Valor is \"RA\" and the shrine is on the next isle.(One of the great things about playing Ultima IV with access to the Internet is I can find where some of these names come from. Aesop is obvious, but it turns out Hrothgar is an allusion to Beowulf (there's also a Hrothgar in Icewind Dale, I seem to recall). A fighter named Timrod could either be a play on the biblical Nimrod or an homage to American poet Henry Timrod. An essay written by the latter contains the line, referring to a man who has internalized his nation's character: \"It is of no consequence, in his case, into what century, or what ultima thule, he may stray; he will still cary with him those characteristics which he imbibed from the national influences around him.\" A WikiPedia lookup on \"ultima thule\" reveals that it was a name used in medieval geographies for \"any distant place located beyond the borders of the known world.\" Mind blown. )For years, I have remembered Ultima IV's dialog system as a pinnacle of CRPG accomplishment, so I admit with some embarrassment that it doesn't quite live up to my memories. It's not in any way \"bad,\" just not as good as I recalled. NPCs respond to such a limited selection of keywords that it really wouldn't have hurt the game if it had just given you those keywords (as games like Morrowind and Quest for Glory do). Moreover, typing words isn't quite the same thing as having dialog options, and Ultima IV doesn't really give you the latter. Except the ability to say \"yes\" or \"no\" to certain questions, you cannot have entire role-playing-driven conversations with NPCs the way you can in Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, or Neverwinter Nights. Nonetheless, this dialog system is very advanced for its time and makes the game a lot more interesting than any other CRPG of the era. You learn scads about the game world and your quest from your conversations.My exploration of Jhelom is fairly swift. There are two people I cannot talk to because they're stuck behind locked doors--I'll have to get some keys to (j)immy them first. Presumably one of them is Geoffrey, who would join me if I wasn't already a fighter, as I don't see him anywhere else. With nothing left to do in town, I make my way out of the city. I'm in the process of wondering if I'm going to need to wait for a pirate ship to get off this island when suddenly a moongate (how could I have forgotten about those?) appears. I step in and find myself on another island, next to the city of Skara Brae. I still haven't had to fight anything yet. I suspect that's coming up.She doesn't look all that ancient to me.If I have any \"regular readers,\" I apologize to you all for my erratic publication schedule. My job involves occasional unexpected business travel, and this month has been particularly heavy. What I need to do is start writing a bunch of postings when I have the time and then publish them at a steadier pace.In my last posting, I started talking about character creation in Ultima IV and how unique it is, and then I got so wrapped up in the back story and manuals that I ended the piece before actually describing character creation. Let's look at that now. In the introduction, after reading the book of history, you stumble into a renaissance fair, where your ankh cross gains you free admission. You wander into a gypsy's wagon where she begins a kind of tarot card game involving the eight virtues.As we'll discover, there is wonderful symmetry in Ultima IV. There are eight virtues of the Avatar, and eight character classes that exemplify those eight virtues. Eight towns serve as home to the eight classes, nearby which are eight shrines in which you must chant eight mantras after using eight runes. Each virtue, meanwhile, has an evil opposite which (usually) serves as the name of a dungeon. In the eight dungeons you find eight stones of eight colors.The game begins with identifying the virtue and, hence, the class, with which you most closely associate. It does this by having the gypsy woman pose a series of hypothetical questions in which you must choose between two virtues. The first question might pit honesty against honor, for instance. Say you choose honor. The next question might give you spirituality and sacrifice. You choose sacrifice. At some point, you'll then have to choose between sacrifice and honor. Hence, you bracket your way to your ultimate guiding virtue and, consequently, your class.In confess that in past Ultima IV games, I engineered my way into a paladin class by always choosing \"honor,\" regardless of how I actually felt. (Paladins are arguably the best Ultima IV characters--strong fighters who can use almost any equipment but are able to cast spells, too.) This time around, I resolved to answer the questions based on my own moral beliefs regardless of the final outcome.\"Thou has been prohibited by thy absent Lord from joining thy friends in a close pitched battle. Dost though A) refrain, so thou may Honestly claim obedience, or B) show Valor, and aid thy comrades, knwoing thou may deny it later?\" No struggle with this one. No arbitrary command from some absentee boss is going to keep me from helping my friends in a fight. I choose valor, and kiss goodbye to the mage class.\"As one of the King's Guard, thy Captain has asked that one amongst you visit a hospital to cheer the children with tales of thy valiant deeds. Dost though A) Show thy Compassion and play the braggart, or B) Humbly let another go?\" I'm not sure this is a fair test of compassion, since presumably one of my comrades would entertain the children as well as I. I don't particularly like talking about myself, though, and I like children even less, so I go with humility. I will not be a bard.\"Thou hast sworn to do thy Lord's bidding in all. He covets a piece of land and orders the owner removed. Dost thou A) serve Justice refusing to act, thus being disgraced, or B) Honor thine oath and unfairly evict the landowners?\" My Lord's a jerk, and I was an idiot for swearing an oath to a jerk. No need to compound the error. I go with justice and, regrettably, chaotic-good my way out of a paladin assignment.\"Thou hast spent thy life in charitable and righteous work. Thine uncle the innkeeper lies ill and asks you to take over his tavern. Dost thou A) Sacrifice thy life of purity to aid thy kin, or B) decline & follow thy spirit's call?\" I'm never terribly moved by the idea of familial obligations in real life, so it's B). The chance to be a tinker is behind me.\"Although a teacher of music, thou art a skillful wrestler. Thou hast been asked to fight in a local championship. Dost thou A) accept the invitation and Valiantly fight to win, or B) Humbly decline knowing thou art sure to win?\" The choice of B) doesn't sound like humility in this case; it sounds like arrogance. How would I know that I'm sure to win? In any event, humility is a nice virtue, but I don't think it should mean that I should avoid winning anything. I wave farewell to the life of a shepherd and choose valor.A realistically difficult choice.\"Thou dost believe that virtue resides in all people. Thou dost see a rogue steal from thy Lord. Dost thou A) call him to Justice, or B) personally try to sway him back to the Spritual path of good?\" Oooh. Really tough call. This is actually a metaphor for a scenario I faced recently. It depends a lot on the likely punishment, but in my case I felt that the punishment was worse than the original crime, so I chose B). I'll do that here, too, even though it means turning my taillights to druidship.\"A local bully pushes for a fight. Dost thou A) Valiantly trounce the rogue, or B) Decline, knowing in thy Spirit that no lasting good will come of it?\" \"No lasting good?\" What about this bully learning his lesson and not picking on other people? Nothing I hate worse than a bully. It's A), no question, which means I reject the path of a ranger and become a standard, run-of-the-mill, no-magic-using fighter instead.In some ways, this works out fairly well. You see, during Ultima IV I will pick up seven companions--one of each class--to round out my party. There are eight potential NPCs who will join your party, but you don't get to recruit the one who belongs to the same class that you do. Dupre the paladin, Shamino the ranger, and Iolo the bard are three of your most memorable companions from later games in the series, whereas Geoffrey the fighter turns out to be a bit of a wet rag. Thus, I face no great sadness that Geoffrey won't be able to join me here.Back to the game. Having made my choice, the game informs me that I experience a \"moment of intense, wrenching vertigo\" while the gypsy advises me to \"seek the counsel of thy sovereign.\"\u00a0 I awake in a forest, on an island, outside a city. I have no equipment, but somewhere along the line I picked up 200 pieces of gold and 300 meals. Two moons float overhead, letting me know in no uncertain terms that I am no longer on earth. After checking my iPhone and finding no service, I steel myself and head for the nearby city to see what's up."}, {"title": "Game 16: Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar (1985)", "date": "Sunday, April 25, 2010", "text": "Ultima IV: Quest of the AvatarUnited StatesOrigin Systems, Inc.

Although the gameplay has advanced only a little since Ultima III, the story, game world, and quest are a huge leap forward.Remembering back to the mid-1980s, it feels like I played Ultima IV for years, first on my friends' Commodore 64s and then on mine, before I won. I have no idea what took so long. When I replayed it in 1994, I was surprised and disappointed at how quickly the game progressed, and how many of the gameplay features I thought I remembered were actually from Ultima V. I played it a third time in 2000 and won it in, I think, a single long day. I hope that 10 years later I've forgotten some of the details and I can approach the game fresh. Blogging should slow down the progress.Searching for a fresh experience, I decided to play the \"recreated\" version of the game offered at http://xu4.sourceforge.net. Everything about the game is the same except the graphics and sound are much better, and there are beautifully designed screens at certain points, such as when you meditate and achieve part of your avatarhood.I'm going to try something different with this game and blog it in the order of gameplay, elucidating new features as I come across them, rather than summarizing them at once in long blog posts.The game begins with a character creation method absolutely unique for its time, and rivaled today only in Morrowind and Oblivion, both of which are paying homage to Ultima IV. After you give yourself a name (mindful of Lord British having obtained his name from his homeland, I chose \"Americus\") and sex, the game draws you into Britannia slowly. You begin at your own home, in the real world, on a walk in the countryside.Wow. It's like the game knows me.You fall asleep under a tree when suddenly a moongate appears in a circle of stones (moongates were introduced in the Ultima series in Ultima II). Before it disappears, someone tosses through a package containing an ankh cross, a cloth map, a copy of The History of Britannia as told by Kyle the Younger, and the game's spell book. These items, of course, were contained within the original Ultima IV game box. The game insists that you read the book of history.All right! Jesus.The map and the History introduce a rich and detailed game world that will remain essentially the same through Ultima VII Part 1. What happened to game manuals like this? After recapping the light stories of Ultima I, Ultima II, and Ultima III, it describes the new land that arose from the \"rubble of Sosaria,\" which Lord British named Britannia. In the new era of peace, Lord British was able to concentrate on improving the quality of life, erecting institutions to learning, meditation, and martial prowess.Eight major cities developed \"into cultural centers for one of the eight major professions.\" Moonglow focuses on mages, Britain on bards, and so on. One of the towns is Skara Brae, apparently an homage to The Bard's Tale but ultimately drawn from the name of a neolithic ruin in Scotland. The professions, or character classes, include two new ones: shepherds and tinkers.The map that I know better than my own home town.Equipment, character classes, monsters, and terrain are described in florid and exciting detail. Oh, we must have some examples:\"DAGGER: Ten inches of beautifully worked steel make the standard Britannian dagger. The traditional basket hilt looks very functional. A favorite weapon of novices.\"\"FOREST: The going is slow through dense woods, with thy speed cut fully in half. The oak so dearly loved by the Druids predominates here, along with healthy growth of Ash and Beech. There is quite a lack of visibility in the forest regions.\"\"HEADLESS: Another evil being best suited to terror and destruction, the Headless is indeed a creature of nightmares. Many a traveler has fled in abject horror at the sign of these headless torsos bearing down upon them.\"Only at the end of the manual do we get a hint of the quest to follow. In an afterword penned by Lord British himself, he says that \"we seek the person who can become a shining example of our nation and guide us from the Age of Darkness into the Age of Light. We have sent this message out to the farthest reaches of the known universe; indeed, we have even spoken across the void of time. Is there one who can complete the Quest of the Avatar?\"Here we have the key to what makes Ultima IV unique. The game is not about fighting some \"big bad\" like Mondain, Minax, and Exodus; it's about achieving moral enlightenment. There is nothing else like this in CRPGs."}, {"title": "Roger Ebert, Games, and Art", "date": "Monday, April 19, 2010", "text": "Roger Ebert's comments that \"video games can never be art\" (both his original comments on the subject and his most recent update) have the Internet in an uproar. He wrote his latest comments three days ago, and already there are hundreds of blog postings both agreeing with him and castigating him. His own blog posting has, of this moment, 1,746 comments. The first one is representative of many of them: \"Roger - as you are sure to be inundated with comments for this post, I  will simply say: You just don't get it.\"Many of the rejoinders criticize Ebert for never having played video games himself. How, then, can he presume to pass judgment on them as being \"not art\"? It's a fair point, so I would like to say, as someone who has played hundreds of hours of computer games in the last three months alone: Ebert is absolutely right.\u00a0No one who has played games would seriously argue that video games are not at times artistic. From the beautiful images of island and sea in Myst to the view from Dive Rock in Oblivion to the cinematic cut scenes in too-many-games-to-name to the movie-quality voice acting in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic to the music compositions that grace the backgrounds of countless games, games have always featured artistic elements. Some of them are quite grand. But the games themselves are not art any more than The Last Supper or The Thinker are games.You may disagree by supplying  your own definition of \"art\" or by trying to shoehorn games into an existing definition of \"art,\" and it will be difficult to argue with you because at its basis this entire discussion is semantic. But in the same discussion, I could prove that video games are \"pornography,\" that pornography is \"literature,\" that good prose literature is \"poetry,\" that poetry is \"religion,\" that religion is \"comedy,\" and on and on until we just end up hitting each other with shovels. Let's try it this way: whether something is or is not any of these things depends on its primary purpose, not what it might happen to accomplish tangentially along the way. Video games do not have, as their primary purpose, the enrichment of human experience through interpretation, and thus they are not art. Don't like that definition of \"art?\" Choose another, but either you won't be able to make video games fit the definition except through selective examples, accident, or metaphor, or you'll be using a definition too broad to be useful.Gamers are upset about Ebert's comments, I suspect, because they're equating \"art\" with \"good\" and \"not art\" with \"bad.\" This is just silly. There are plenty of wonderful things in life that are unquestionably enriching and enlightening and worth experiencing but that are just as unquestionably not art. How about:The view from a balcony overlooking the Grand CanyonA muffuletta on Decatur StreetA game of chessThe Winter OlympicsA Sunday New York Times crosswordFalling in loveKant's theory of categorical imperativeEbert sums it up nicely: \"Why are gamers so intensely concerned, anyway, that games be defined  as art? Bobby Fischer, Michael Jordan and Dick Butkus never said they  thought their games were an  art form. Nor did Shi Hua Chen, winner of  the $500,000 World Series of Mah Jong in 2009. Why aren't gamers content  to play their games and simply enjoy themselves?...Do they require validation? In defending their gaming against  parents, spouses, children, partners, co-workers or other critics, do  they want to be able to look up from the screen and explain, 'I'm  studying a great form of art?'\"I just wrote a posting about how, as a young man, a CRPG shaped my moral development. I'm investing hundreds of hours in this blog and playing the games that it covers, and thus I have as much reason as anyone to make believe that playing games isn't a complete waste of time. But something doesn't have to be \"art\" to not be a waste of time. And games are not art.\u00a0\u00a0[Later Edit: For those of you stumbling on this posting years later, please read this comment below before getting all upset.]In his autobiography, Benjamin Franklin recalls that once he established himself as a successful printer in Philadelphia, he \"conceiv'd the bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection.\" Through his readings, he had identified a list of 13 virtues that together would equal this perfection: temperance, silence, order, resolution, frugality, industry, sincerity, justice, moderation, cleanliness, tranquility, chastity, and humility. Realizing that trying to practice all 13 at once would be impossible, he set up a system by which he focused on one per day, carefully recording his progress in a ruled \"score sheet\" he set up in his notebook.\"I determined to give a week's strict attention to each of the virtues  successively. Thus, in the first week, my great guard was to avoid every  the least offence against Temperance, leaving the other virtues  to their ordinary chance, only marking every evening the faults of the  day.\"When I was 13 or 14, I did the same thing Franklin did, only not having been exposed to his autobiography at that point, my list of virtues was different: honesty, compassion, valor, justice, honor, sacrifice, spirituality, and humility. I wrote each with its definition on an index card and every morning I shuffled the cards and chose one at random. That one, I did my best to practice for the day. If honesty came up, I was careful to tell no lies throughout the day. If it was sacrifice, I looked for ways to do something charitable. Valor was always a tough one. I scoured Bartlett's Familiar Quotations in the school library and made little signs to hang around my room. I still remember some of them:\"Honor and shame from no condition rise; act well your part, there all the honor lies.\" -- Alexander Pope\"God hath sworn to lift on high he who sinks himself by true humility.\" -- John Keble\u00a0 Not many, I suspect, would admit to deriving what amounts to their religion from a computer game. But I had rejected conventional religion even as a pre-teen. I balked at Judeo-Christian doctrines that seemed both haphazard and arbitrary: meticulous rules about food and dress, but none about the need to actively seek out and destroy evil (my interpretation of \"valor\"); commandments against adultery and sabbath-breaking, but none against assault and slavery. Ultima IV, on the other hand, offered a comprehensive and completely nondenominational--secular, even--system of virtue. It fit me like a glove. Perhaps if I had read philosophy, the history of the samurai, or Ayn Rand, I would have encountered an equally suitable virtue system that would be more \"respectable\" as a source. But I didn't. Instead, I played Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar.Ultima IV's system seems to owe something to Hindu mythology, particularly in the concept of the \"Avatar,\" which I think has been misunderstood by Ultima players and critics alike. In Hindu belief, an avatar is an earthy manifestation of a god--a form the god takes to walk on the mortal plane. In the Ultima series, however, your character is repeatedly described as the \"Avatar of Virtue.\" \"Avatar\" in this sense is not being misused as a synonym for \"exemplar\" or \"missionary\"; rather, the game is suggesting that virtue itself is made manifest in your character; that abstract concepts like honor and valor can, in fact, be given physical form. By using the term, the creator is equating virtue with godhood, suggesting that our gods can be--perhaps should be--principles as well as beings. Why, indeed, should we worship a god who personifies truth, love, and courage when we can instead worship truth, love, and courage themselves?At the same time, the use of \"avatar\" has a subtle second meaning. The character that moves around the screen is literally your, the player's, avatar in the game world. From the opening cut scenes of several of the Ultima games, showing you sitting at your computer, a soda can at its side, the games invite you to engage in a sort-of metacognition about the CRPG dynamic in which your fictional alter-ego acts in a way that is more virtuous, more courageous, more adventurous than in the real world.In most games, this process is one-way--usually, at least, and thankfully so. Gamers who spend hours killing fictional enemies and then go out and kill real enemies are justly labeled as murderers, with negative consequences for their victims, themselves, and the gaming community. In less dramatic examples, no one learns how to sword fight from Oblivion or cast real magical spells from Wizardry. But here, in Ultima IV, we have a game that invites us to apply its lessons to the real world--to improve ourselves in the same way that we improve our in-game character. And if we decline to do this--decline to take this system of virtues seriously--just because its source is a \"video game\"...well, what better example do we have of a failure to live up to the most difficult-to-master of the eight virtues: humility.Creating your Ultima IV character.There has never been, and I suspect never will be again, a CRPG--or, indeed, any game--like Ultima IV. Today's gamers wouldn't have the patience for it. I'm surprised they ever did. Perhaps it was only because CRPGs were so young, computers less ubiquitous, and computer gamers more cerebral (in the 1980s, mostly nerds had computers), that Ultima IV ever found an audience in the first place. Imagine, today, a game without a \"big boss,\" but rather a more complicated quest to become a moral exemplar; a game in which progress is made less through combat than through meditating at shrines; a game whose character creation process invites you to explore your own morality; a game in which, to win, you must give gold to the poor, sacrifice hit points at a blood bank, always tell the truth, and let fleeing monsters escape; a game in which NPC dialog occurs not by choosing among options but by actually typing the words you want to speak.If you came here for gameplay details, I apologize for the long and abstract polemic. I'll actually start playing (re-playing, in this case, for the first time in 10 years) in the next posting. But this discussion explains, I think, what ultimately led me to create this blog. Ultima IV wasn't my first CRPG, but it was among the first few, and for years it has stood in my mind as the foremost example of what a CRPG can achieve. If this intrigues you at all, ignore that it's old, ignore that it has lousy graphics and sound, ignore everything but the plot, and just play the game.Back in town, the adventurers review their progress.\u00a0 PhantasieUnited StatesIndependently developed; published by Strategic Simulations, Inc.Released in 1985 for Apple II, Atari 800, and Commodore 64; 1986 for Atari ST, PC-88, PC-98, and FM-7; 1987 for Amiga and Sharp X1; 1988 for DOS and MSXDate Started: 13 April 2010Date Finished: 19 April 2010Total Hours: 12Difficulty: Moderate (3.0/5)Final Rating: 39Ranking as of Game 359: 298/359 (83%)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is the second time I'm applying the rating system I outlined a few weeks ago. Phantasie may be my favorite or second-favorite CRPG so far, so I'll know the system works if it produces a reasonably high rating.1. Game World. Although mostly a standard high-fantasy world, Phantasie does a good job fleshing itself out with back story and characters. It doesn't approach the depth and detail of modern games, but it's good for its time, rivaled only by the Ultima series. Although its towns are completely interchangeable, its multiple dungeons each have their own unique character. Your quest is clear from the start, and although Nikademus himself doesn't make an appearance until the end, your progress through the game shows the effects of his tyrannical rule, and the Black Knights are a constant reminder of the main quest. The only thing I can fault the game on is my preference that your actions affect the game world. In this game, they don't, really. The dungeons continually re-set, meaning you find the same NPCs in the same perils every time you enter. In the end, you can kill Nikademus again and again. Final score: 6.2. Character creation and development. The classes and characteristics are RPG standard, but the wide variety of races is interesting. Unfortunately, the choice of classes and races has no real bearing on the game except for a single dungeon you must have a minotaur to enter. Character advancement is fairly basic, giving you extra hit points and spells. Uniquely, all characters--including fighters and thieves--can cast spells, although not many. Final score: 4.I can't think of any other game that allows you to play a troll main character. No...wait. Might and Magic VIII. Bollocks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3. NPC Interaction. There are NPCs in the game, but your interaction with them boils down to you stumbling into them and them telling you things. Through the innovative use of scrolls, however, the game does allow you to learn interesting things about the world via your character interactions, and talking to them is necessary to advance the game. There are no role-playing options during dialog, however. Final score: 4.4. Encounters & Foes. There are many monsters in the game, but they aren't very well distinguished among each other. They basically break down into two varieties: those that hit and those that cast. Aside from deciding whether to greet or fight (neither of which has long-term implications), there's no way to role-play during your encounters. On the positive side, there are both random and fixed encounters, and dungeons respawn, allowing you to replay battles and encounters, and re-find treasures. (Just so it doesn't seem like I'm inconsistent with #1, this is a good thing when it comes to fighting, but a bad thing when it comes to quests and NPCs.) Final score: 5.5. Magic and Combat. At first, I thought Phantasie was equal with Wizardry in tactics with just a different battle screen. But it's not. First, since all your characters can attack (as opposed to just the first three in Wizardry or The Bard's Tale), you don't need to carefully plan the actions of half your party. Except towards the end, the battles are comparably easy, so there's no reason to meticulously ration your spells. Even at the end, they aren't very hard. My biggest objection is to the imbalance between combat and magic. You must have a wizard in this game, both to travel to the city of the Gods and to slay Nikademus. Fighters, no matter how high level, are completely useless--not relatively, but completely--against some of the higher-level creatures. Final score: 4.6. Equipment. The variety of equipment in Phantasie is admirable. In addition to different types--swords, staffs, daggers, ring mail, chain mail, shields, and so on--there are different levels of augmentation, from regular through +10. Use of weapons and armor is not limited by character class but rather by strength and dexterity statistics. Items you find on your journey cannot be used right away; you have to get back to town and distribute them among your characters. During this process, it's very clear which weapons do the most damage and which armor and shields offer the best protection. Unfortunately, there are no terribly unique weapons and armor, and the game doesn't offer any descriptions of them. Final score: 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Distributing equipment among your characters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7. Economy. Sucks a bit. After the initial equipment purchase, there's nothing else to buy. All gold goes to training, and for most of the game you don't have enough gold to fully train your characters to the levels they've achieved. Suddenly, towards the end, you end up with more gold than you know what to do with. Final score: 2.8. Quests. Phantasie offers a compelling main quest, but there's only one outcome. Despite what I thought at the beginning, there are no real \"side quests,\" although there is at least one side-dungeon. The quests do not really offer role-playing opportunities. Final score: 3.9. Graphics, Sound, Inputs. The four-color graphics are pretty bad on the PC version, and sound had not developed enough by this time to be un-painful. Final score: 2.10. Gameplay. Theoretically, the game is alinear, allowing you to march off in any direction from the beginning. In practice, this would swiftly get you slain by any number of creatures even if you could survive the swimming (a skill you don't fully develop until a higher level). Similarly, with only a couple exceptions, you can progress through the dungeons in any order you wish, but you can only fully complete them in a specific order. The game offers the same experience for each play; there is no replayability. Even though you can only save in towns, the overall difficulty felt a little too easy at times. But it is evenly paced from beginning to end, and it's over before it gets boring. Final score: 4.Final Total: 39. This means I liked it slightly more than Wizardry and The Bard's Tale but not as much as Ultima III. I guess that works. Next up....yes! Ultima IV.Well, damn. I guess I'll have to play Phantasie II then.The ending of Phantasie came at me all of a sudden. I had intended to get in at least one more posting before I won. This is par-for-the-course in some of these older games, though, which don't telegraph their final chapters the way that modern games do.Many of the assumptions that I made about the game in the last posting turned out to be false. First, there are no side quests--what I thought were side quests were just steps along the path to the main quest (although there is at least one dungeon that seems to serve no purpose but to provide an interesting diversion). Second, there aren't a fixed number of Black Knights. Although the game repeatedly tells you there are nine, they must regenerate, because I must have killed 30-40 of them.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In your progress through the Phantasie dungeons, you meet the heroes of the pre-Nikademus era: the dwarven fighter Kilmor, the sage Filmon, and Lord Wood. Each gives you clues, items, and passwords to help you along the path through the dungeons and, consequently, the main quest. Your progress culminates with a visit to the city of the gods, where you meet Zeus himself, and then finally to the castle of Nikademus. [Later edit: 5 years after I posted this, an anonymous reader pointed out that you don't actually fight Nikademus in this game; you fight the Black Lord, leader of the Black Knights. Every time I say \"Nikademus\" from here on, I mean the Black Lord. I was under this misapprehension for a long time!]The reason I was surprised by the ending was that the game led me to believe I had to collect nine rings along the way. But when the game finished, I only had six of them. Phantasie makes the origin of the \"nine rings\" concept quite clear and pays homage via the name of one of the game's villains.Shouldn't it be J. R. R. Trolkin?The odd-dungeon-out is the interesting dungeon of the Bleebs, where you encounter a multi-colored race that offers you a series of riddles having to do with which color tells the truth and which lies. I like it when games throw logic puzzles at you like this. The Bard's Tale, in retrospect, offered some fun riddles that I forgot to mention in my postings.This turned out to be a lie.Some of the encounters give you at least some ability to role-play, although we're nowhere near modern games in dialog and freedom of decisions. You can choose whether to rob a jewelry store, whether to pray to or deface statues, and whether to rescue a young maiden or an old man from lava. (To be fair, though, if you rescue the young maiden you can't continue in the main quest.)Nikademus himself is pretty tough, repeatedly casting spells that do dozens of points of damage to all of your characters. Fighters barely damage him. The only way to defeat him--like the only way to defeat a lot of other big bosses in the game--is to repeatedly cast Fireflash IV.The cloak makes the outfit.The game lets you keep playing after the final battle--in fact, even after the final battle, Black Knights continue to roam the land and you can go back and defeat Nikademus again. In fact, you have to go back if you want to finish the dungeon and get the final scroll.I guess Nikademus is multi-dimensional.I made a video of the end game--no sound this time. Final accounting to follow in another post."}, {"title": "Phantasie: Plugging Along", "date": "Sunday, April 18, 2010", "text": "I continue to only vaguely understand why the colors had to be so bad in the DOS version of this game. I'll try to educate myself, but if someone wants to summarize it in a comment, I'll owe you one.I think Phantasie is the first CRPG to introduce the convention shown in the above screenshot: hiding the map and only revealing it as you explore. No, scratch that. Rogue did that first. Well, Phantasie is the first non-\"Roguelike\" to do it, and the first for outdoor areas.I believe we're also seeing the first \"side quests.\" I received a mission in a dungeon to rescue a priest from some lizardmen. This could be part of the main quest, so I don't know just yet if it's a first. Either way, it's fun to see the elements that now come naturally in CRPGs introduced  game by game.A neat feature of the game is that as you explore new areas, you find scrolls that help explain the area, provide hints to your quests, and flesh out the stories. For instance, the scroll below talks about the cave where I am to find the uncle of Lord Wood.Alas, it did not end well for the unfortunate uncle: The game is progressively getting  more difficult (although it hasn't really become \"hard\" yet), with battles against numerous tough foes, including spellcasters and legions of undead.I have already slain four Black Knights, and from what the scrolls suggest, there are only nine of them. I suspect they do not stay dead, however. They are quite difficult to kill, and 8bitjeff's comment in my first Phantasie posting about needing the Fireflash IV spell turned out to be rather prophetic. It's really the only thing that does any serious damage.My biggest problem at this point is gold. It costs thousands and thousands to level up my ogre fighter, dwarf fighter, and hobbit thief, and I never seem to have enough. Several of my characters are two or three levels below where they could be if I just had sufficient funds. I hope dungeons coming up bring more riches.It's also fun, in a vaguely annoying way, to see how these older games protected themselves against piracy. The Bard's Tale would make you answer questions from the game map when you leveled up. Now as I explore the Phantasie dungeons, the game periodically stops to ask me questions from the manual, like this one:The game makers, of course, didn't anticipate flatbed scanners, OCR, and the Internet.That's about all there is to cover right now. I'm definitely going to continue with this one until the end."}, {"title": "Game 15: Phantasie (1985)", "date": "Monday, April 12, 2010", "text": "PhantasieUnited StatesIndependently developed; published by Strategic Simulations, Inc.Released 1985 for Apple II and Commodore 64; 1986 for Atari ST, PC-88, PC-98, and FM-7; 1987 for Atari 800, Amiga, and Sharp X1; 1988 for DOS and MSXDate Started: 13 April 2010\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 In a response to my first posting, a blogger going by the handle Gooberslot asked a good question: \"Why only PC rpgs? You say you don't want to 'frig' around with emulators  but dosbox is an emulator too.  Plus, you're missing out on playing the  best version in some cases.  The PC sucked compared to some other  computers until VGA came out and it still sucked in the sound department  for a while after that.\"Phantasie illustrates this quite well. Here, for instance, is a screenshot of the Amiga version of Phantasie:Here, in contrast, is the same screenshot from my DOS port:Yuck, right? Here's a nice shot from the Atari ST version in battle:..versus my DOS version:I am green with envy. Get it...green with...right. Moving on.So, at least in the graphics department, the DOS version blows. And a couple of weeks ago, when I posed the question, you were almost all for me trying the non-DOS versions. So yesterday evening, I made an attempt. I Googled \"Apple II emulator,\" \"C64 emulator,\" \"Atari ST emulator,\" downloaded some, and gave it a go. I'll spare you the rest of the details--which involve a difficulty finding Phantasie downloads for some of those systems, an unfamiliarity with their conventions, crashes and freezes (perhaps owing to my running Windows 7), lack of clear DOSBox-like frontrunners in the emulator departments, and so on--and simply announce my recommittment, as bad as the graphics are, to staying with a DOS/PC-only gameplan.That aside, I like Phantasie so far. The story is simple: the island continent of Gelnor has been conquered by a tyrannical wizard named Nikademus, who maintains fear with a cadre of near-invincible Black Knights. Your party is composed of newly-arrived adventurers seeking fame and fortune, and liberating the land from Nikademus seems like a sure way to both.Phantasie is notable as the first RPG from Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI), which would soon gain the gratitude of CRPG fans everywhere by making the \"gold box\" Dungeons & Dragons games. That reminds me: how long is it until I get to Pool of Radiance? One, two, three, four....nineteen games. Damn.The game is multi-character, allowing you to choose from fighter, monk, priest, ranger, thief, and wizard classes. It offers more races than any CRPG I can think of: in addition to humans, dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings, you can also play gnolls, goblins, kobolds, lizard men, minotaurs, ogres, orcs, pixies, sprites, and trolls. Wow. The monster classes all excel in at least one attribute (you have the standard strength, intelligence, dexterity, etc. in this game) but they pay for it in increased training costs. And the manual isn't kidding about this: it cost 24 gold to move my human ranger for level 2 to level 3; for my ogre fighter, it was 1,056 gold.You move about the game world in a top-down perspective, with your entire party represented by a single icon, much like in Ultima III. The perspective changes a bit when you enter a dungeon. The dungeons look like paper maps in which you reveal passageways as you move. Special encounters are represented by little symbols and described in text at the bottom. It sounds primitive, but I actually rather like it.Since you can save your dungeon progress when you leave, this makes Phantasie the first game I know to automap. The encounters have been fun and fresh so far: levers to pull, a sage with a ring, a door that locked me in a room until I found a secret exit, and a \"pile of gold covered with a gooey substance\" that turned out to be the honeycombs of a giant bee hive.The combat system in Phantasie is unusual and, I think, rather fun. Statistically and tactically, I suppose it's little different than Wizardry or The Bard's Tale. Your six characters line up in a single line to face your foes, who can be in up to four ranks. Most of your characters can attack only the first rank, but your thief can dart into any rank and your spellcasters can target the entire field. Like Wizardry, you set an action for each character and execute them all at once. The unique thing is that the animation shows your characters leaping and thrusting when their turn comes, and their blows connect with a satisfying crunch.The animation doesn't change the basic tactics, though. Each of your characters can attack, parry, or cast a spell. Attacks are split into thrust (more damage, only one attack), attack (moderate damage, two attacks), and slash (minimal damage, three attacks). You also have the macro options to avoid combat by greeting the monsters, threatening them, fleeing, or begging for their mercy (and giving over your gold).In between adventures in dungeons and wilderness areas, you return to towns to rest, level up, and buy and sell equipment. When you enter a town, the game asks how you want to divide your accumulated experience points among your characters. I can't think of a single other game that does this, allowing you to channel everything into  one character for quick development or spread it evenly among your group. The former options means that if a character dies, you can train a replacement in fairly short order. Man, do I wish Wizardry had that option.The town of \"Pelnor.\" Arthurian influence?I created a party consisting of a human ranger (Aodin), an ogre fighter (Ghalar), a dwarf fighter (Yalgar), a halfing priest (Sanctavia), a gnome thief (Slissk), and an elf wizard (Arcanius). In my first couple hours of gameplay, I've explored one dungeon and collected a series of scrolls that tell me more about the land and Nikademus. This is actually a pretty cool way to slowly divulge more about the game world and the central quest.The scroll goes on to say that nine wizards forged nine magical rings to combat Nikademus, but he perverted the power of the rings and used them to turn the wizards into Black Knights. This is starting to sound vaguely familiar...Finally, I'll note that the game has been challenging so far. I've lost a few characters, and there's no temple in the towns (at least, not the first town), so I've had to create new ones. Gold looks like it's going to be a problem; I have a few characters ready to level up but not enough money to pay for it. You can only save in towns, but at least (unlike Wizardry and The Bard's Tale) you have the option to quit without saving if the battle goes badly.In short, Phantasie has tactics as deep as Wizardry, stuff in dungeons as varied as Telengard, a lore as rich as Ultima III, and a difficultly level as pleasing as The Bard's Tale in its early stages. I hope the rest of the game lives up to its beginnings!(If you're interested in a video of the gameplay, including the combat, here's one on YouTube, albiet for the Atari ST version. Hopefully I'll finish setting up my new laptop soon and I can make my own.)"}, {"title": "Game 14: Wizardry III (1983)", "date": "Saturday, April 10, 2010", "text": "Wizardry III is cheerfully indistinguishable from Wizardry or Wizardry II except for the specific dungeon. Everything else--graphics, controls, character classes and races, spells, and gameplay--are essentially the same. I say \"essentially,\" because there do appear to be some new monsters, weapons, and armor. Instead of leather and chain mail, for instance, you have a \"cuirass\" and a \"hauberk.\"As with Wizardry II, you cannot create characters in Wizardry III; you must import them from one of the previous games. Unlike Wizardry II, when you import them, you do not keep your levels, experience and gold. Instead, the game resets you to level 1, explaining that you aren't really importing the characters so much as instilling their spirits in their descendants.At least the game tries to come up with a plausible reason you have to restart at level 1.The scenario is that the normally placid kingdom of Llylgamyn is suddenly experiencing volcanoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, and storms. Your party of adventurers is tasked with climbing through the lair of the dragon L'kbreth to retrieve from her a mystical scrying orb that can reveal the source of the disasters.In my first few hours of gameplay, I probably cycled through 50 characters. The game is much more difficult--at least on level 1--than the first Wizardry. 9 out of 10 battles killed at least one of my party members, forcing me either raise him, or (when I was broke) to go back and create a new character in the original Wizardry so I could export him. Needless to say, this made it difficult to advance any of the characters to level 2.Nonetheless, I stuck with it, and ultimately managed to stabilize my party at character levels 2-4 while mapping the first level of the dungeon. The level has a few interesting features, including a \"lake\" that I cannot cross, and a castle surrounded by a \"moat\" (the graphics don't actually show you a moat , of course; the game just says it's there).The moat is full of serpents called \"moat monsters\" that aren't too hard to kill and provide a decent bit of experience.The castle is full of guards, but ultimately you get to a series of rooms, a couple of which have stairs upward. Before them is this cryptic message:This sounds like you need both good and evil characters to proceed, but the game won't let you combine them in one party, so I'm not exactly sure what it means.As I wrap things up for the night, I'm trying to decide if I'm going to continue with Wizardry III or not. On the one hand, I don't have a particularly good reason not to. On the other, since the gameplay is identical to Wizardry, I'm not sure I'll have anything much to blog about. I'll sleep on it and let you know after the weekend.On a last note, someone has lovingly created a page devoted to the Wizardry series at:http://www.tk421.net/wizardry/He's uploaded character files that I could have used to give Wizardry II a second shot, but I've moved on from that. I checked out the walkthrough for Wizardry II and it doesn't sound like I missed much. I've got to stop browsing it before I accidentally spoil Wizardry III.Later Edit: Party slaughtered on Level 2, created new party, party slaughtered again. Had enough with limited-save, permanent-death games. On to Phantasie.Edit from 04 January 2015: Almost five years after offering this miserably short post on Wizardry III, I returned and finished the game. Continuing coverage picks up with this posting. \u00a0 Okay, here's the essential problem with Wizardry II: you can't create characters in it. Instead, you have to import your characters from Wizardry. Now this would be okay, maybe, if during the import the game auto-leveled you to something sensible, but it doesn't. Also, when you import your characters, it permanently removes you from the original game. You can't even go back and re-import them if they die. Man, these games are harsh.Remember how in Wizardry I, I kept losing my party because the game auto-saves and death is permanent? Well, the same thing is true of Wizardry II. Now this was bad enough in Wizardry I, when I had to create characters from scratch and build them up to a high enough level to either a) rescue the bodies of my original party or b) replace my original party. But in Wizardry II, if I lose my party, I have to go back to Wizardry I, create new characters, build them up in Wizardry I, then import them to Wizardry II, and finally send them on the rescue expedition. I'm sorry, but I don't have that kind of time.I might do it if there was anything different about Wizardry II, but the manual that came with The Ultimate Wizardry Archives confirms that the gameplay, classes, races, spells, commands--everything--is exactly the same. Even the names of the equipment shop, tavern, inn, and temple are the same, despite the fact I'm supposed to be in a different city. Wizardry II isn't a new game: it's a new dungeon in the same game.I did try. As you may recall if you read that entry, only four of my characters survived the final battle in Wizardry. I imported them into Wizardry II along with two level 1 characters I created in Wizardry to take the places of the dead ones. I figured that I could keep them in the back of the party and just build up their experience using the other characters. This worked for a time, and I got them up to level 6 (my other four came in at level 12). Unfortunately, one of the dead/replacement characters was a mage--the only class that can cast the MALOR teleport spell--and on Level 1 of the Wizardry II dungeon, you need the MALOR spell to progress.\u00a0 Wandering around on Level 1, I found a room in which the sorceress Gnilda (the creators' anagrams are showing again) spoke about the main quest. The City of Llylgamyn was once protected by the magical Staff of Llygamyn, which prevented any evil-doers from entering the city. Regrettably, the staff had a loophole: those born in Llygamyn were immune to its preventive effects. Someone evil named Davalpus staged a coup and slaughtered the royal family, and in the ensuing war the staff was lost to the depths of a dungeon and the city brought to rubble. My party's quest is to recover \"symbols of Gnilda's favor\" so that she'll give me the staff and I can restore peace and prosperity.Unfortunately, Llygamyn is going to have to remain a smoking ruin, because shortly after receiving said quest, my entire party--even the veterans--was slaughtered by a group of \"kobold kings.\" No way am I re-playing Wizardry just so I can have characters at a high enough level to start Wizardry II. The process of importing, creating new characters, starting up, and mapping Level 1 took close enough to six hours that I feel like I've kept within my rules.They looked so easy...Now isn't everything I'm saying also true of Wizardry III? Yes, Wizardry III also does not allow you to create characters; you must import them from the original Wizardry. But according to the manual, you're not really importing the original characters but rather their \"descendants,\" and during the import it re-sets you to Level 1. You don't even get to keep your gold. Hence, since unlike II, III doesn't require high-level characters, I have no cause not to give it a try.Since Wizardry II is the same game as Wizardry, I see no reason not to give it the same overall score: 37/100.The manual that came with the Archives  is a lot of fun, full of comical little drawings of your characters. I  wish I could show it to you, but my scanner is broken. It also explains  things a little better than the original manuals. Flipping through it, I  have to say, Wizardry VI and VII look pretty cool. I'll get to  them eventually.Edit from 26 March 2014: Nearly four years after I first played this game, I returned to it and won it. The GIMLET score fell to 32 upon consideration of the game in its entirety.

It's feast or famine with me. I'll try to develop better consistency in the future.Earlier this week, I outlined a rubric for rating CPRGs in 10 categories. It's highly subjective, dependent upon my own preferences and peeves (but hey, it's my blog). Tonight, I'll apply the GIMLET for the first time to The Bard's Tale. Ratings for each category is out of 10.1. Game world. The Bard's Tale's game world is not terribly imaginative. It is set in a somewhat generic high-fantasy city called Skara Brae which the evil wizard Mangar has taken over, unleashing scores of monsters into the streets. That's about all you're given. You learn nothing of the larger game world, nor how long Mangar has been a threat, nor where he came from to begin with, nor why your party suddenly appeared on the scene. Your actions do not effect any changes to the game world--not even completing the main quest. Even if you slay Mangar, monsters still roam the streets, and if you return to Mangar's tower you can slay him again! Perhaps the only unique thing about the game world is the implicit importance of bards in the society. Category Score: 2.2. Character creation and development. For its time, the character creation system is reasonably advanced, allowing you to choose from a number of classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Hunters do very little damage but have a decent change of scoring a critical hit. Thieves are worthless fighters but necessary for trap-removal if you don't want to waste spell points. Spellcasters can cycle through four different classes, learning new spells each time. For all but the spellcasters, though, leveling up after a certain point doesn't seem to do anything but give you additional hit points. It's a little odd that you can only select male characters. There are no alignments, and there is no--absolutely no--character-based role playing. Category score: 3.3. NPC Interaction. There are essentially no NPCs with whom to interact. In some squares, you stumble upon people and objects, but they mouth a few scripted lines at you and send you on your way. As with all games of this era, you have no dialog choices, no real opportunities for role-playing, and certainly nothing as advanced as romances. Category score: 1.4. Encounters and Foes. As I noted when creating this evaluation model, I like random encounters and re-spawning, and this game is all about both. There are some scripted encounters, but they re-spawn the moment you leave the level and return.  One memorable encounter has you fighting four groups of 99 barbarians each. If you have the right spells, you can survive it, it takes a good 10 minutes, and it  nets you more experience than any other battle in the game. It's nice to be able to return to it now and then for a boost. The monsters are relatively well-distinguished, especially for a game of the era, each featuring different types of attacks, magic, and weaknesses. The manual doesn't really describe them for you, though, and of course there is no opportunity for role-playing in the encounters. Category score: 5.5. Magic and combat. Combat in The Bard's Tale is identical to Wizardry, with the first three ranks having the ability to attack and the others able to use items and cast spells. The combat is very tactical, forcing you to choose your actions carefully to maximize your chances of survival and minimize your expenditure of resources. Since your six characters are all piled on to one screen, though, there is no way to role-play them individually in combat. Category score: 5.6. Equipment. The game has a very large variety of equipment, from normal weapons and armor to special musical instruments (usable only by bards) that cast a variety of spells, rings, staffs, wands, lanterns, magic carpets, and so on. There is no description attached to any of these (no game will have item descriptions for years yet), but one unique aspect to The Bard's Tale is that you sort-of have to fiddle with your plundered objects to figure out what they do. My one gripe is that it's relatively easy to achieve the lowest possible armor class, after which finding new armor doesn't seem to do anything. Also, the damage you do in combat is overwhelmingly based on your level and not your weapon, so there's no particular reason to keep upgrading and comparing. Except for a few quest items, equipment is thoroughly randomized in the game world. Category score: 5.Those horns do some serious damage.7. Economy. Gold is very plentiful in this game, thank God, because you need a constant supply for healing. Healing is really all you need it for. After your first trip to the equipment shop at the beginning of the game, there is no need to ever visit again to buy anything. But because resurrecting characters, un-withering them, and turning them back to flesh from stone cost so much (and rise with levels), there is never a point that you're not grateful for a hoard of gold. Category score: 6.8. Quests. The Bard's Tale has a main quest, but there is only one outcome--killing Mangar. There are no side quests or any opportunities for role-playing in quests. Category score: 2.9. Graphics, Sound, Inputs. The graphics are quite good for the era--leaps ahead of Wizardry. Some of them are lightly animated. On the DOS port, there are no sound effects except for the bard songs, which suck a bit. Controls are by keyboard or mouse, and both work fine. Category score: 4.10. Gameplay. In some ways, the gameplay is fairly linear--you must progress through the dungeons in a specific order. But having done so, you are free to backtrack to previous dungeons. Skara Brae itself is fully explorable at the outset; there just isn't much reason to explore. The difficulty is \"pleasingly difficult,\" as I wrote in one point, because you can only save in the Adventurer's Inn and you have to carefully ration your spell points in dungeons. Towards the end, though, it becomes incredibly difficult, especially with the ability of certain monsters to turn your characters to stone, which you have no spell to redress. Every stoning requires a trip back out to a temple, if you're lucky to survive long enough. Monsters that drain your hard-earned levels also make you tear out your hair. There is absolutely no replayability; you'll get the same experience no matter what party you use or what decisions you make. Category score: 4.The Bard's Tale's total score is: 37/100. On my master ranking list, that ties it with  Wizardry I and suggests I liked it better than anything I've played so far except Ultima III.

I know my postings on this game have been a bit schizophrenic, sometimes seeming as if I liked the game and sometimes as if I hated it. If so, then the posts are accurate, because that is exactly how I felt.The game is challenging from the very beginning, thrusting you into a Skara Brae full of monsters in which the difference between survival and death depends primarily on luck. Run into some kobolds and you'll make it; stumble into a house with six barbarians, and your level 1 party is history. The game became more stable once I started dungeon-crawling, and for four out of five dungeons, my characters rarely died. But once I hit Mangar's tower, the vagaries of chance returned with a vengeance. Turning a corner and blundering into a party of six demons, four master wizards, and three red dragons is relatively commonplace, and if you can't run from the battle, there's essentially no way to survive it. Demons, dragons, magic users, and several other creatures are capable of launching deadly attacks that do more than 100 HP damage to all your party members, against which you have essentially no defense (the anti-magic bard song seemed, in my experience, to do nothing). If my characters were 10 levels higher, they wouldn't survive such an encounter, and I don't think there was any realistic way to get them 10 levels higher. It would have taken millions of experience points (most battles, even at the end, were giving me 5,000-7,000 each on average).This is the bastard causing all the trouble.So my winning was mostly luck. I made probably 20-25 forays onto Level 5 of Mangar's tower, dying each time, before I found the path that led me to Mangar himself. After that, I traced that path about 12 times before I finally got lucky and defeated Mangar. I would have recorded it, as I usually do for end games, but I never knew which time would be \"the\" time, and by the time I finally won, I had given up on recording.\u00a0\u00a0 Mangar is surrounded by two demon lords and three vampire lords. Vampire lords can stone you with a single touch and demon lords can belch fireballs. Mangar himself is no pushover, capable of some serious damage. Again, I just got lucky. The monsters decided to go after my summoned dragon, giving me enough time to kill a couple of them. The demon lords decided to cast spells instead of spewing fire. One lucky round is really all it took.(Incidentally, the summon dragon spell is the most awesome spell in the game. The dragon almost always gets the first attack, and if you're lucky he'll breathe fire and wipe out an entire group of monsters.)\u00a0 \u00a0 Winning gives you 300,000 experience points--like I really need those now, thanks--and returns you to the Adventurer's Guild, where I was happy to save and quit. I never finished mapping Level 5. As I allow myself to do once I've finished, I consulted a walkthrough and discovered I didn't really miss anything, although he found the final battle \"disappointingly easy.\" Whatever. Apparently, I could then have gotten a cool magic item, but I don't see any reason to keep playing after I've won.I'm going to do a quick posting with a final ranking for The Bard's Tale. After that, I have to regress to Wizardry II and Wizardry III (I ordered The Ultimate Wizardry Archives after my first attempts to play them didn't work) before moving on to Phantasie.One final thing: most of the messages scrawled on the dungeon walls turned out to be clues to one thing or another. Even the message \"Thor is the greatest son of Odin, \"found in the first dungeon, turned out to be helpful in the fifth when answering that question gives you a little Thor figurine you can use to summon him. But one message I never did figure out, also from the first dungeon: IRKM DESMET DAEM. It doesn't seem to be an an anagram (\"mirk Ed Mets made?\") and it doesn't give enough letters to be a solvable cryptogram. Googling the phrase just turns up references to The Bard's Tale. Any ideas?Bard's Tale, have you no sense of decency?! No sense of pacing?! This is not how you craft a good CRPG.  You don't make it moderately difficult (\"pleasingly difficult,\" I said a few posts ago; oh, how you must have cackled at that) for 90% of the game and suddenly introduce battles with 12 demon lords on the last level! You do not include a host of creatures--oh, those %*#$*& vampires--who can level-drain you with a single touch. Do you know how long it takes to gain levels in your game?You do not--above all, you do not--allow creatures to stone you with one touch and not include a freaking stone-to-flesh spell! And if you do--you utter, irredeemable pricks--you do not make such battles inescapable so that the last 50 hours of playing your game boil down to entering the dungeon, climbing up five levels, getting stoned, and having to make your way out of the dungeon to heal the stoned character at a temple. Yeah, nice gameplay. Bastards.But if you must do all of these things, must you also--hey, I'm talking to you, you heartless time-sucker--must you also make it so that healing a stoned character costs 15,000 gold pieces? Mere moves from the end of the game, must you make me return constantly to low-level dungeon-crawling to build up my finances and experience points? Is there no end to your cycle of futility?AAAAARRGH!"}, {"title": "Ranking and Rating CRPGs", "date": "Wednesday, April 7, 2010", "text": "I've been thinking about the process of rating CRPGs. What makes certain games so addictive and enjoyable? I started making a list of everything that occurred to me, and tonight I organized that list into categories. It just so happens that there are 10 categories, and if I assign 10 points to each one, I have a decent 100-point scale.\u00a0 The things I like about CRPGs may not be the same things you like. For instance, I don't care much about graphics. All I ask is that, as I put in my list, they're not distractingly bad. I care even less about music. I know that game developers pay composers and musicians to record extensive soundtracks for their games, but one of the first things I almost always do when firing up a new game is turn the music off.On the other hand, I do value some unusual things. For instance, I love games that extensively describe the different weapons and armor you pick up. I also love the process of finding new stuff and outfitting my characters. I value strong NPC interaction as much as exciting combat. I prefer my areas to re-spawn so I can return to beginning areas once I'm level 12 and idly fireball rats just for fun.I could read these all night.With this in mind, I created this master list of characteristics (titled with a nod to my Reddit user name, and my favorite drink). Each of the individual items combine to create a score of 0-10 in each category, contributing to a master score of 0-100. Let me know if you think I missed anything obvious.

It isn't so bad and yet at the same time it sucks incredibly. Instead of losing your entire party to the dungeon depths, as in Wizardry, your entire party returns to the Guild of Adventurers, dead but with all of the items, gold, and experience they've accumulated. Doesn't sound too shabby.The problem is, it costs a lot to resurrect a dead character, especially a high-level dead character. Resurrecting six dead characters cost way more than I had at this point. I had to create a dummy character just to exit the Guild. I was able to resurrect one character immediately, but to get the other five, I had to build up my savings. It took a good three hours before they were all happy and healthy again.It sounds horrible, especially to modern gamers, but I actually really, really like this aspect of The Bard's Tale. Death isn't a game-killer the way it is in Wizardry, but boy does it have consequences. Since you can only save in the Guild of Adventurers, every dungeon foray is a risk, creating a palpable tension as you wander your way through the passages. And every once in a while, you stumble into an encounter like this one (there were actually two more on this same level, with a dragon and a high-powered wizard) that makes your stomach drop and an expletive escape your lips.Modern games make it far too easy. In something like Baldur's Gate, you would save every five or ten minutes. If you stumble on to a soul sucker, you might treat the first battle against him like a test run. If your characters die--or, heck, even just lose more hit points than you want to spare--no problem. Just reload and run the encounter again with the experience at your back. Even that was too tough for the creators of Neverwinter Nights, though. In that game, you could just use your Stone of Recall to take a time-out, get healed up, and return to battle fresh. What a bunch of wusses we've become.Because of the frequent save points, modern games depend on the difficulty of individual battles to make the games challenging. In The Bard's Tale, Wizardry, and other games of the era I'm playing, there are plenty of difficult individual battles, but it's the totality of the expedition that brings the difficulty. You must constantly strategize. How much gold do I need to get from this encounter to make the \"trap zap\" spell worthwhile? What should I set as my bottom hit point threshold before I return to the surface? Do I want to expend 15 spell points on this group of wights, or take the risk that they'll turn me into a crippling old man with one touch? I've only got 15 squares left to map on this level, but my characters only have 1/2 their hit points. Should I press on or go back?Exhilarating. Fortunately, I have a lot of games like this left to play.I finished mapping and exploring the Mad God's catacombs last night, finding in the process his eye (which is equippable, but I don't know what it does). An inscription on a wall told me to \"seek the Mad One's stoney self in Harkyn's domain,\" while another one more cryptically told me, \"to the flower fly the mad one die once lost an eye!\" In any event, this suggests that the third dungeon is one of the towers in the corners of the Skara Brae map. Since there are three of them, I'm guessing I'm about 2/5 done with the game.Made a really dumb mistake last night. Because I don't have a rogue, I have to cast \"trap zap\" on every chest after battle, which depletes the spell points of my conjurer fairly quickly. Last night, my conjurer and magician reached their seventh spell level, so I decided to dual them to other classes to start gaining additional spells. The intelligent thing to do would have been to dual my magician to a conjurer so he could have \"trap zap\" too, and my conjurer to a sorcerer. Instead, I dualed my magician to a sorcerer and my conjurer to a magician. I know this sounds complicated, but trust me, I'm an idiot."}, {"title": "Bard's Tale: Intense Dungeon Crawling", "date": "Sunday, March 28, 2010", "text": "I had hoped that I would be able to announce that I had won The Bard's Tale this weekend, but I'm not even close. I finally just finished mapping the first dungeon of four levels; at least, I hope it's only four. I nearly didn't find the fourth level because getting down to it involved (d)escending through a pit in the floor with a levitation spell in effect. The pit was barely visible, though.As you can imagine, the monsters get tougher the lower the level. I'm finding that spellcasters are my worst enemy. I routinely run into parties in which there are 12 or more spellcasters in three or more groups, making it nearly impossible to clear them out before they get a couple of fireballs in. Most monsters are standard D&D fare; I haven't encountered any truly unique ones yet.Fortunately, I've yet to have my entire party wiped out. I don't even know what happens if that occurs. I've lost individual characters several times, though, and it's getting expensive to raise them.Some miscellaneous things about the game:There are several party-effect spells that I've found useful to have running when I start my dungeon crawling. These include MALE (levitate), YMCA (mystical armor), MACO (compass), and GRRE (a light spell that also reveals secret doors). The screen shot below shows my party in a dungeon with several buffing spells active (lined up in the center of the screen).These spells take up a lot of spell points, and spell points do not regenerate in the dungeons. I've gotten in the habit of standing outside Roscoe's Energy Emporium, casting these buffing spells, then going inside and paying to get my spell points recharged before heading into the dungeons.There are four spellcaster classes in the game--conjurer, magician, sorcerer, and wizard. You cannot select the latter two when you start, but you can change a conjurer or magician to those classes (or each other) once they reach Level 3. There are seven spell levels per class. I'm on the cusp of getting Level 7 spells for my conjurer and magician, at which point I'll switch them over to the other classes. Theoretically, I guess, one character can cycle through all spellcasting classes and get all the spells, but this must take an incredibly long time.Only after about 10 hours of playing did I figure out that the \"T\" key pauses the game. If you don't pause during mapping and such, the clock keeps running and your spells run out faster. It would have been handy to know that earlier.The \"P\" key starts combat with your own party, giving you a chance to have your characters assail each other. I can't imagine why I would want to do this.When you first encounter creatures, you can try to run from combat. If you succeed--which you seem to do about 75% of the time--you stay in the same square, and as far as I can tell there's no penalty. I have frankly been running from a lot of combats if they look difficult.Instead of armor and weapons +1, +2, and so on, better armor and weapons seems to be distinguished by the metal used to craft them. During this dungeon crawl, I found some mithril swords and armor that seem to be one step up from the regular weapons and armor I had. I also found a \"bardsword\" that only my bard can equip; I'm not sure what it does.The main purpose of dungeon crawling so far, it seems, is to pick up hints and clues written on the walls. I don't understand most of them yet. These are some of the ones picked up in the first dungeon:\"Pass the light at night!\"\"Golems are made of stone.\"\"IRKM DESMET DAEM\"\"Heed not what is beyond understanding.\"\"Thor is the greatest son of Odin.\"\"The hand of time writes but cannot erase.\"\"Seek the snare from behind the scenes.\"One inscription was helpful, though. A magic mouth appeared and told me that \"a man called Tarjan, thought to many to be insane, had through wizardly powers proclaimed himself a god in Skara Brae a hundred years ago. His image is locked in stone until made whole again...\" I'm guessing Tarjan is the name of the \"mad god\" whose priests keep asking me for his name. I suspect this leads to the second dungeon.I'll leave you tonight with my map of Level 4 of the wine cellars/sewers. With luck, I'll win the game this week."}, {"title": "The Bard's Tale: Not Quite As Fun as I Thought", "date": "Wednesday, March 24, 2010", "text": "Dungeon-crawling in The Bard's TaleMy praise for The Bard's Tale over the last couple of posts may have been a bit too effusive. I was taken in by the graphics and character classes and other trappings of the game, but now that I'm a few hours into it, the gameplay is very repetitive and frankly not distinguishable from Wizardry.Since I last posted, I finally advanced my conjurer high enough to obtain a healing spell, but it wasn't the breakthrough I had hoped for. Healing takes so many spell points, and spell points regenerate so slowly, that really the only way to survive in the game is to pay for frequent healing at the temples. This isn't that crippling because gold is plentiful and there's very little else to spend it on, but it makes dungeon-delving problematic. You can't risk going too deep lest you find yourself unable to make it out.Things I've done and discovered since last night:You shouldn't start the dungeons too early. The first dungeon to explore is the wine cellar (I'm blocked from the others for now). When you go from street to dungeon, you go from facing one party of monsters at a time to sometimes four or five parties at a time. It's a huge leap. After dying a couple of times, I decided I'd better stay in Skara Brae a little while longer and build up my characters.One wonders what brought such a diverse group togetherThere's not much in Skara Brae. Most of it is marked on the map that comes with the game. The bulk of the city is composed of interchangeable houses which, when you kick in the door, sometimes offer up monsters. From a role-playing standpoint, it somehow seems wrong barging into houses and slaughtering the denizens, many of whom are innocuous-sounding creatures like hobbits and dwarves.One of many interchangeable streets in Skara BraeOne thing I did find: a temple of the \"Mad God.\" Instead of healing me, the clerics ask for the name of the Mad God. There must be some adventure here later.Tougher critters come out when night falls.The Bard's Tale tried to catch me pirating. At one point when I leveled up, the Review Board asked me a question that I was only able to answer by looking at the game map.1980s DRMSince there seems to be an equal chance of encountering monsters every time you enter a house, there's no reason to march all over the city looking for battles. I set myself up near a temple and just went back and forth between two houses across the street from each other, killing monsters for hours. As you can imagine, it was a bit boring, so I watched an episode of Lost while I was doing it. Last night's episode was pretty good, incidentally.\"Death itself.\" From a zombie. Get it?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once my characters were up to Level 7, I entered and mapped out the first level of the wine cellar. Not much here: one trap, one spinner (a square that when you land on it points you in a random direction, confusing your mapping), stairs down, and two doors marked \"fine wines\" and \"rare wines\" but which, as far as I could tell, had nothing but monsters in them. A lot of the squares aren't used, and I'm wondering if there isn't some other way of finding secret doors other than running headfirst into them the way you do in Wizardry. I didn't find any secret doors on Level 1, in any event.I do still like mapping.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I'll keep plugging away. In the meantime, I'm mulling over a comment that Gooberslot made on my first posting. He or she called me on only playing PC/DOS CRPGs, noting that not only am I missing games, in some cases I'm \"missing out on playing the best version.\" Downloading Apple II, Atari, and C-64 emulators would mean going back to pick up Space, Space II, the Dunjonquest games, Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves, Return of Heracles, Questron, and SunDog: Frozen Legacy, and Adventure: Only the Fittest Shall Survive.Should I do it? Or should I stick to my original plan and cover DOS/PC CRPGs only?

The graphics, sound, and game play are notably improved in  over most of the previous games on this list, and especially the game of which it is a direct descendant: Wizardry.As in Wizardry, you control a party of six characters representing different classes and races (oddly enough, you cannot specify sexes; all characters, at least judging by their portraits, are male). These characters exist on a list in the lower part of your screen while the upper part is devoted to a first-person view of the game world. Your characters can buy and equip a variety of weapons, armor, and miscellaneous items, some of which must be identified if you find them after a battle. In battle, just as in Wizardry, you specify an action for each character, and then your characters and the enemies go at it all at once. You may face multiple groups of enemies of varying numbers. Only your first three characters can attack. You cast spells by typing in their names, although in the case of The Bard's Tale it's a four-letter code instead of the entire spell name.So far it sounds so close to Wizardry that I'm surprised the developers weren't sued for copyright violation. But in subtle details, The Bard's Tale is better, and (at least so far) more fun. To name a few:The graphics are much better. Character and monster portraits are animated, as are scenes inside various buildings.There is an awesome variety of races and classes. Here for the first time are half-orcs, paladins, hunters, monks, and four different mage classes--two of which you have to transition to after you've gained some experience. Hunters do critical hits at higher levels, and monks (as in D&D) are skilled in unarmed and unarmored combat.Bards appear for the first time in a CRPG (unless you count the \"lark\" in Ultima III). And the class isn't just a name: bards can sing helpful bard songs in battles and use certain musical magic items. \"The Seeker's Ballad,\" for instance, produces light in dungeons and makes foes easier to hit; \"Falkentyne's Fury\" increases the damage you do in combat. In between songs--I love this--bards have to have a glass of wine or ale to refresh their windpipes.The town is Skara Brae. At first, I thought the Skara Brae of Ultima IV must be paying homage to The Bard's Tale, but then I discovered that Skara Brae is the name of a neolithic archaeological site in Orkney.A variety of locations to visit. There are several taverns, temples, and shops, and a spell-recharging place. A place called \"the review board\" advances you in levels, but you have to find it (it's not on the game map).You can summon or join NPCs to your party. More on this in a second.Cute little touches: a street is blocked by a statue of a samurai. Attack it, and it becomes a samurai for real. Kill him, and you can pass. Just beyond him is a tavern where, if you buy a bottle of wine, the bartender lets you into a dungeon.All of that said, the game is pretty hard, mostly because you start off with no healing spells. I thought maybe I'd get some after my mages advanced to second level, but I didn't. This means that almost all the gold you collect from battle has to go to temples for healing and resurrection.My party consists ofPalamedes, a human paladin (I almost always lead my parties with a paladin)Blaargh, a half-orc hunterGrimgnaw, a dwarven monkTaliesin, a half-elf bardGrey Star, an elven magicianLailoken, a gnomish conjurerA rogue seemed unnecessary because conjurers get a spell called \"trap zap\" at the first level (I wish I'd had that in Wizardry).I've spent most of the first few hours mapping Skara Brae, fighting various battles, and all-too-often raising and healing my characters at temples. I have most of them up to Level 2. I'm hoping I get the healing spells at Level 3, at which point I'll start exploring the first dungeon.Despite the Stone Elemental's help, three of my characters died in this combat.One thing has made combat exceedingly easier in these opening stages. At the top of your party list is a slot for a summoned creature. While exploring the key commands, I discovered that if you hit the \"Z\" key, a stone elemental automatically appears in that slot. I have no idea why. It seems too easily-discoverable to be a cheat. Either way, I'm getting a lot of use out of him.The Ultimate Wizardry Archives arrived while I was away and, as promised, I'm going to go back and try Wizardry II and Wizardry III when I'm done with this game, but it's going to be hard to regress to those games after The Bard's Tale."}, {"title": "Good Enough", "date": "Monday, March 15, 2010", "text": "Early in Casablanca, there's a scene of a turboprop landing on an airstrip. It is the plane bringing Nazi villain Major Strasser into the film.  Cinematography and special effects being what they were in 1942, the shot is manifestly of a small model plane suspended with wires. You can't help but notice it. You might even titter involuntarily.If a director re-made Casabalanca today (I know, heaven forfend, but bear with me), he might shoot it in black and white. He might use some of the same corny dialog. He might keep the same period music. But he would clearly not shoot the plane scene with a cheap balsa wood model. In a remake, the shot of the plane landing, if it was not a real shot of a real airplane landing, would sure look like one. And yet--here's the key--the fact that in the 1942 film the shot looks fake and unsophisticated in no way detracts from your enjoyment of the film. You recognize and accept it as a necessary limitation of the time.The earliest thing we can call a film is generally thought to be a 24-frame assemblage of pictures of a racehorse named Sallie Gardner, shot by Eadweard Muybridge in 1878. The earliest surviving motion picture was shot in 1888 in England and is called Roundhay Garden Scene. It lasts all of two seconds. The first copyrighted film in the United States is the five-second Fred Ott's Sneeze from 1894. These films, and hundreds of others from this era, are interesting curios to students of film history, but none of them will inspire you to curl up in front of the television with your partner and some Chinese food. Neither the technique nor the technology, neither the art nor the science, were sufficiently advanced for these films to be truly \"entertaining\" in the modern sense.And yet, at some point, completely without fanfare, suddenly they were. We can argue and debate exactly when that point occurs. I might go with Birth of a Nation (1915), but I could understand if you want to make a case for the sound era--let's say 42nd Street (1933) or It Happened One Night (1934). Certainly, I think we would all agree, that by the Wizard of Oz (1938), film craft had advanced to the level that even today, three-quarters of a century later, you would not hesitate to watch a film from the era, or to recommend it to others. The art and science of film-making didn't stop at that point--it has continued to evolve steadily year after year since then, but at some point it was \"good enough\" to create art that is timeless.Love Me Tonight (1932). Not just \"good enough\"; sublime.The same is true of music. The earliest recordings are faint, scratchy horrors that utterly mask the talent of the artists. But at some point it became \"good enough.\" Tell me that Louis Armstrong's \"West End Blues\" or Coleman Hawkins's \"Body and Soul\" would sound any better in a modern recording studio, and I will call you a fool.This, then, is my theory: any art or entertainment form will eventually evolve to a point in which it is \"good enough.\" After that point, no matter that it continues to evolve, its creations become timeless--accessible to modern audiences, entertaining, and moving, despite their age and lack of technical sophistication.When do we hit this point with CRPGs? I haven't decided yet, but I'm beginning to suspect that, for me at least, it's with The Bard's Tale, on which I hope to blog later this week*. But then, I'm something of an archaeologist of CRPGs, maybe a little like the film historian delighted at Fred Ott's Sneeze. Where would you put the \"good enough\" point for CRPGs? Ultima Underworld? One of the \"Gold Box\" games? Daggerfall? Surely not as late as Baldur's Gate? Post your answer in the comments--or disagree with my theory if you must.Good enough for me*I'm on the road this week and will, alas, have limited time for gaming and blogging. This is too bad because I was really getting in to The Bard's Tale before I left."}, {"title": "Game 10: AutoDuel (1985)", "date": "Friday, March 12, 2010", "text": "AutoDuelUnited States Origin Systems (developer and publisher)Released 1985 for Apple II, Commodore 64, and Atari 8-bit; 1987 for DOS and Atari ST; 1988 for Amiga and MacintoshDate Started: 12 March 2010\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I was really excited when I saw AutoDuel coming up on the list. I remembered playing it on my Commodore 64 over 20 years ago. I was looking forward to the ultra-tactical combat involving dozens of vehicles, in which you would pull your 24-person bus alongside the outlaw gang's tractor trailer unit, unload a volley of rifles, and then board it. Meanwhile, you'd accelerate your reinforced pickup truck to ramming speed and plow down the enemy's motorcycles. Good times.Except, I realized soon after loading the game, that wasn't AutoDuel. That was Roadwar 2000. And come to think of it, it wasn't a CRPG anyway, so I don't know why I would have thought it was on the CRPG list. AutoDuel, it turns out, I've never seen.The main splash screen nearly knocked me out of my chair. Lord British and Chuckles?! It turns out that AutoDuel is an Origin systems game, published sometime between Ultima III and Ultima IV. Based on a board game by Steve Jackson called Car Wars, it exists in a post-apocalyptic American northeast in which roving gangs of bandits prowl the highways in souped-up armed and armored vehicles. You start as an amateur car warrior buying and outfitting your first vehicle, and slowly improving your skills, fame, vehicles, and finances through random combat, arena duels, and courier missions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The main character windowYou begin in New York City. Like any good CRPG, there are a number of places to visit: a truck stop to buy armor and get a bus to another city, an assembly yard to buy and outfit your vehicle, a salvage yard to sell salvaged goods, a garage to repair and store your car, a weapons shop to buy weapon upgrades, a chapter of the American AutoDuel Association where you can get missions, Joe's Bar for drinks and rumors, the Gold Cross for healing and clone-making (more below), the FBI for God know's what, and an arena where you can fight duels.The Big Apple is a little more compact than I  rememberYou start with hardly any cash, so generally you go to the arena where, on \"amateur night,\" they will give you a car temporarily. Defeat four enemies and you win about $1500, enough when combined with your starting cash to buy your first vehicle.Amateur night at the arenaControls are with the mouse or keyboard. I found the keyboard counter-intuitive and the mouse only slightly less so. The main problem with AutoDuel is that the battles are frelling impossible. It took me four tries to win in the arena. Then I was killed almost immediately upon purchasing my first car.Combat is based partly on statistics, including your scores for driving and marksmanship, but also partly on arcade-style hand dexterity. Unfortunately, I'm not very quick, apparently. But I don't think it's just me. The game screen isn't very big, and you don't really see enemy vehicles until you're practically on top of them. At that point, it's all too easy to accidentally run into them, destroying your armor and whatever weapon happens to be mounted at the impact point.What makes the difficulty annoying is that AutoDuel is yet another game with permanent death. You can save your progress, but when it reloads it deletes your saved game. The only way around this is to visit the Gold Cross and purchase a clone who will take over for you if you happen to die. But they're awfully expensive.When you defeat enemies, you can get out of your car and salvage stuff from theirs.After dying probably 10 times I decided that the problem was I didn't have enough cash to outfit a good car. Prompted by a hint in the game manual, I took a bus to Atlantic City, where after playing blackjack for a good two hours of real time, I had about $16,000. (I was about to say that this qualifies as the first mini-game in a CRPG, but actually I suppose the Ultima TIE fighter battle takes that prize.) With this, I returned to NYC and outfitted a van with armor and several different weapons.How much extra for some sudden, uncontrolled acceleration?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I had enough left to buy a clone but forgot to do so. I hit the open road, fought and won a couple of battles and then encountered a hotrod which in about two seconds obliterated my rear armor and killed me.\u00a0 \u00a0 My six hours is up, and I'm tossing in the towel. I know I'm opening myself up to accusations of half-assing two games in a row, but AutoDuel was about the least fun I've ever had with a CRPG--and to be honest, I'd debate applying that label to this game. In any event, I can't find any evidence that there's a main quest or a way to \"win\" AutoDuel, so all it's doing is keeping me from The Bard's Tale. [Edit: As commenters have pointed out, there is a way to win. Later, I did.]If you want another point of view, this YouTube poster has loaded a five minute video along with a couple of paragraphs of gushing commentary. The video shows him winning the first arena duel, buying his first car, and heading out on the open road. I sympathize with one of his commentors, who says, \"i like it [but] 2 hours later\ufeff i cant do anything  but die & die again.\"At least I got to hone my blackjack skills.****Further reading: Unsatisfied with this brief coverage? I don't blame you. It was early in my blog, and I didn't have much of a work ethic. Six years later, I revisited the game and won. Read my updated coverage. \u00a0[Ed. from the future: Don't read this entry. It's bad. Read my later coverage of the game instead.] \u00a0\u00a0 In a post a few days ago, I mentioned that I was unable to get Wizardry II to work, and now I'm having the same problem with Wizardry III. Both the second and third editions of Wizardry are essentially just expansions to the first, and they require that you export your characters from Wizardry I. The problem: I can't get the import/export routine to work. It seems to require a floppy drive. The Internet has been no help. I've ordered The Ultimate Wizardry Archives from Amazon, so hopefully it will contain playable versions. If it does, I'll return to those two games.On to Alternate Reality: The City, a game I had never heard of until I reached it on Wikipedia's chronology. The premise from the manual is unique: \"You're kidnapped by an alien spaceship [shown at the cutscene above] and find yourself in a room with only one exit. Through this doorway you see the City of Xebec's Demise. Overhead is a panel with constantly changing numbers. As you go through the door, the numbers freeze. This sets your level of stamina, charm, strength, intelligence, wisdom, skill, wealth, and hit points.\"\u00a0\u00a0 This is a unique character creation method.\u00a0\u00a0 With the alien abduction and all, I expected a science-fiction setting, but the moment you step through the gate, you're in a high-fantasy style city complete with thieves and swordsmen. I know because they keep killing me. Every few seconds, whether you're moving or standing still, there seems to be a chance of a random encounter, which gives you several options, shown below.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No matter what you do, there's a chance it will fail and the creature will attack you. Innocuous-sounding individuals, like merchants, couriers, and guards, are shockingly violent and attack you without provocation--rendered all the worse because it seems you start the game with no weapons or armor.There are shops, inns, and taverns scattered about in \"Xebec's Demise,\" which seems to be quite large. The natural thing would be to enter a shop and spend some of my copper pieces on some equipment. The problem is, the game starts you off at 6:00 in the morning (you determine this by visiting an inn and checking the time) and the shops don't open until 8:00. I can't keep my characters alive for this two-hour interval! In fact, no matter how long I wander around, desperately trying to stay alive, the time never seems to advance!If I can get past this hurdle, there seem to be a number of things about Alternate Reality: The City to like. First is the underlying mystery: how did an alien abduction land me in this fantasy world? Second, the technology of the game is a huge leap forward from other games of this era. You can't tell it from the screen shots, but the first-person perspective is continuously-scrolling. As you move forward, the world smoothly moves around you. I was not expecting this in a 1985 game (I'm playing a 1988 DOS port, but I would guess the basic interface is the same). The sound is also compelling, with each creature having its own little leitmotif. Finally, the graphics, in color and detail, are far beyond the wire-frame views of Wizardry. Check out this lovely screen shot of an inn:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So what, in God's name, is going on in this game? What does this medieval setting have to do with aliens? Why is everyone trying to kill me? What is the goal of the game? My rules forbid me to read walkthroughs and spoilers, and the manual offers no help.  But I did leave myself the option of soliciting input from readers. Have any of you played Alternate Reality: The City? What advice do you have for me?\u00a0Later Edit:I decided on a new rule: after I decide to stop playing a game, or win it, I will allow myself to look up FAQs to see what I missed and to answer my questions. Wikipedia has a good article on the Alternate Reality series, and there's also an extensive FAQ here. It turns out that the City was the first in a planned six-game series, but only The City and The Dungeon ever got made. There is no way to \"win\" Alternate Reality: The City, and the only reason to play really is to build up your character for the Dungeon, which never received a DOS port and thus isn't on my list. Life's too short to play just to mess around. Next game.****\u00a0\u00a0Further reading: As noted above, in 2016, I offered much better coverage of the game.

As I think I said in my first post, I don't believe in saving and reloading games just because you don't like a certain outcome, like a character dying during a battle. Instead, I force myself to haul my character to the healer and get him or her raised or resurrected. It makes the game more challenging. The only time I reload is when my entire party is wiped out. Even with this restriction, though, my characters only died a few times.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A commenter pointed out to me that another blogger has already done a fantastic job with the Ultima series: Zac Bond's \"Blogging Ultima.\" Over a one-year period from 2007-2008, he played every Ultima game, including the little-known Escape from Mt. Drash and the Nintendo Gameboy Runes of Virtue. I'm trying to avoid spoilers, but I read his commentaries for I, II, and III. We had a lot of the same impressions--I even took the same \"Copy Protect!\" screen shot as him, and he also commented on the rampant evil of your character in Ultima II. Anyway, if you like my blog, his is definitely worth reading through (he still posts now and then with new material).\u00a0\u00a0 As far as I know, no one has blogged Wizardry, so I still have a corner on part of this market.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although the gameplay was occasionally a little repetitious, I found Ultima III to be authentically fun.  There are hints of the greatness that would soon follow in Ultima IV. The storyline is much more  sensible than in previous Ultimas, the magic system much more  developed, and the combat more tactical. If you're really interested in  getting in to the Ultima series  but don't want to slog through some of the nonsense in Ultima I and Ultima II, I recommend starting here.The towns of Fawn and Monitor/Montor, first introduced in Ultima I, are here--I think for the last time until Ultima VII. You also run in to both Dupre and Shamino, soon to be your close companions in Ultima IV, in a couple of bars. As I said last time, Iolo and Gwenno are both in Lord British's castle. You practically have the whole gang here.Finishing the game involves visiting every town and talking to each person to obtain a series of clues. By piecing these clues together, you discover that the main steps are:Visit the dungeons and find each of four \"marks\"--hot iron brands on the walls that I guess permanently imprint on your characters. The Mark of Kings allows you to advance to higher levels; the Mark of Fire allows you to cross lava without damage; the Mark of Force allows you to walk through force fields; and the Mark of Snakes allows you to bypass the silver snake guarding Exodus's castle.The things I do for Sosaria...Take a ship through the whirlpool and into the land called Ambrosius. Within this land there are four shrines, and at each shrine you find a \"card.\" The are called love, sol, moons, and death. You need these to defeat Exodus.Find exotic arms and armor, which are the only weapons and armor that work in Exodus's castle.Build up your characters until they're strong enough to make it through Exodus's castle.Exodus's castle, beyond the silver snake. Anything to do with the later Serpent Isle?Of these steps, the last is the most time-consuming. I discovered fairly early in the game that your spell points do not increase as you level up. They are dependent upon your ability scores and stay fixed based on those scores, so I realized if I was ever going to get my cleric to cast \"greater heal\" or \"raise dead,\" I'd have to increase her wisdom. Fortunately, the shrines in Ambrosia that hold the cards also allow you to raise your stats--for a price of 100 gold per single stat increase.For hours, therefore, I spelunked the dungeons, collecting both gold and experience, and made repeat trips to Ambrosia to increase my numbers, focusing on wisdom for my cleric and intelligence for my wizard.  Some of the dungeons have fountains that heal you to your max hit points, and I found that a good strategy was to stand near one and wait until attacked, then heal after battle. I also found a town that contained a large cache of treasure chests I could plunder. They refreshed each time I left and re-entered, so it was an easy if time-consuming way to build up my gold.This town made life a little easier.The dungeons, I should mention, are a lot more interesting than in Ultima I or Ultima II. First, you have to use them--they're the only way to get marks. Second, they have a lot more perils, including traps, gremlins that steal your food (God, I hate those little buggers), strange winds that blow out your torches, fountains both foul and refreshing, and occasionally treasure rooms. You really do have to map them so you can avoid running in to the same traps over and over. Fortunately, you can buy gems that, when peered at, give you a map. I took screen shots of these maps and then annotated them in Word. Also, unlike previous Ultimas, in the Ultima III dungeons you can't see the monsters coming. One second you're walking down the hall and the next you're in battle.This is for Gandalf!Now, I did break my rule about saving and reloading once. Look, I'm not an evil man, but at least once every Ultima game, you simply have to try to kill Lord British. Well, it was surprisingly easy in this one. Lord British's castle holds a frigate which you can steal and use to blast guards, jesters, and other castle denizens--including our revered sovereign:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 If you leave the castle and return, he's back on his throne, acting like nothing has happened. Still, I figured I'd better not press my luck and I reloaded.When my characters all had 2150 hit points and reasonably high attributes, I decided to try my luck with Exodus. It was a little easier than I expected and I won on the first try. The monsters were fairly difficult, and just before the end you face a battle with--this is definitely an Ultima III original--the floor itself. Wave after wave of floor tiles, which you cannot see, attack you.Ah, that dastardly floor! Quick, Ur-Emp, cast PINE-SOL!After that, it's a simple matter of inserting the four cards in to Exodus, who seems to be a computer.The heroes destroy Skynet...uh, ExodusI recorded the ending as usual, including some audio this time. I'm going to see if I can find someone to whom to \"report my feat.\" After that, it's on to Wizardry III if I can get it to work or Alternate Reality: the City if I can't.\u00a0\u00a0 ****\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further reading: My posts on the entire Ultima series: Akalabeth (1980), Ultima (1981), Ultima II (1982), Ultima III (1983), Ultima IV (1985), Ultima V (1988), Ultima VI (1990), Ultima VII (1992), Ultima Underworld (1992), and somewhere in there we have the dreadful Ultima: Escape from Mount Drash (1983)."}, {"title": "What is a CRPG?", "date": "Wednesday, March 10, 2010", "text": "As I mentioned before, I've been working off of Wikipedia's chronology of computer role-playing games, going in order of publication date (regardless of the specific version I play). There are plenty of games on this list to keep me occupied for years even if I never get bogged down in an impossible game like Rogue again.The list is notable for what it excludes, though. First, of course, it excludes console RPGs instead of PC RPGs. I hate to ignore them, as some of them are quite good, but there's a limit to how much I'm willing to invest in the project, and I can't see hunting down old consoles and cartridges. Second, it excludes online multi-player CRPGs, which I assure you I will never never touch. Look at the name of my blog. Assuming that I mean it literally--and I assure you I do--what do you suppose will happen to my life if I pick up World of Warcraft? End of discussion. (In any event, most of the older ones are offline and hence unplayable.)But aside from platforms, what else is missing from Wikipedia's list? Essentially, anything that isn't a CRPG. But what, exactly, distinguishes a CRPG from other types of games? For instance, consider the following games (some of which you may not be familiar with). Are they CRPGs or not?ZorkHeroes of Might and MagicDiabloKing's QuestMystAccording to Wikipedia's list, only one of these classics is a CRPG. Zork is an \"interactive fiction\" game, which we used to call \"text adventure.\" The Heroes of Might and Magic games are turn-based strategy games. The King's Quest series are \"adventure games,\" as is Myst. The only CRPG on the list is Diablo, which Wikipedia classifies as an \"action RPG\" but still includes on the master list.This is a little too bad, because there were a number of games that I was looking forward to playing that I won't play if I stick to my original plan. Text adventures like Zork are among them, as is the  Heroes series--I've never played them before and I was hoping they'd flesh out the Might and Magic world a little more. But I have to draw the line somewhere, and that means either using Wikipedia's definitions or creating my own convoluted list with various justifications for leaving things on or off.Alas, you will not see this screen shot again on this blog.The distinction between different video game genres is important to me because I am, notably, a \"CRPG addict,\" not a first-person shooter addict or a simulation game addict. Frankly, games in other genres bore me. When my wife was addicted to Myst and The Seventh Guest, I yawned. I clapped when some magazine (can't find it now) referred to Myst as a \"pseudo-interactive screen saver.\" Often when I find myself bored by a CRPG it's because it strays too close to another genre's territory. To what specific elements, then, am I addicted?In another article, Wikipedia tries to define CRPGs and comes up with the following core elements:Character development, whether based on experience points or use of skillsFreedom of movement throughout the game world, allowing you to go navigate around at your pleasure, going backwards and revisiting locations if desiredQuests, including one \"main quest,\" the completion of which wins the gameA usually high-fantasy themeAt least a partial focus on combatUsing this list--which on the surface seems sensible--we can see why some games are excluded. Interactive fiction or text adventure games like Zork have quests and freedom of movement, but no real combat. (There was a troll and a thief in Zork, but battles like those are few and far between and owe themselves entirely to luck.) Strategy games like the Heroes series have only very limited character development, quests and freedom of movement. Adventure games tend to lack character development.The theme or setting of the game does not seem to me to in any way characterize a CRPG. Yes, most are set in Tokienesque fantasy worlds, but plenty are set in post-apocalyptic landscape or science-fiction settings, and I don't see any reason why you couldn't develop a good CRPG in a realistic modern setting. The theme is important, of course, and I'm not a huge fan of genre blending (witness my summary of Ultima II), but I don't see this as an inextricable element of a CRPG.If I were coming up with my own list of elements that make up a CRPG--the things I'm truly addicted to--the only ones I'd retain wholesale are \"character development\" and \"freedom of movement.\" The rest I would rework and add to as follows:Character identification. You don't just develop a character in a CRPG, you build the character from the ground up, including its race, sex, and--most importantly--name. Granted some CRPGs give you limited or no option in these areas, but almost all give some of them, and I can't think of one (I'm sure I'll encounter one eventually) that doesn't let you name the character. In a CRPG, you're not playing as Gordon Freeman or Solid Snake, you're playing as you--your alter-ego, your avatar, within a fantastic setting.Weapons, armor, and items to  buy, find, and equip. This method of \"character development\" is as  meaningful as experience points and leveling.\u00a0\u00a0Find a cooler weapon. I dare you.Combat at least partly based on probabilities rather than action. Whether your sword connects with the orc's head, and how much damage it does, isn't dependent on your aim or how fast you press the button--it's dependent upon your underlying attributes (strength, dexterity), the attributes of the weapon you're wielding, modifiers for any spells in effect, and so on. There are of course different types of combat in CRPGs, some turn-based and some real-time. In the real-time games, like Diablo or Oblivion, you have to have at least some dexterity with the mouse to make attacks and to evade or block your opponents' attacks, but the underlying statistics exert influence over the result.Game progression through combat and dialog, as opposed to solving puzzles (some CRPGs have puzzles, but they're usually light).Interaction with NPCs. This is admittedly light or non-existent in some early CRPGs, but the promise is there, and the evolution of meaningful dialog is fairly swift. By Ultima IV--coming up--you had conversations by actually typing the keywords you wanted to say.A CRPG would let me talk to her!Random encounters. In action games and shooters, you almost always encounter the exact same foes in the exact same locations. In CRPGs there are some set encounters, but almost all of them randomize at least some of the enemies you face. You never know when you'll round a corner and meet a party of orcs.Choice of actions, and changes in the game world based on your actions. This is perhaps the most important element of a CRPG to me. I want the game world to feel my presence. Early games didn't do a great job in this area, but there was always something. In Ultima II you could steal food and kill guards or not. What you did changed how you were treated in that town for that session, at least. As games progress through the years, your choices and their consequent reverberations on the game world get more complex, to include \"good\" and \"evil\" choices and game outcomes dependent on them. An addict like me loves walking through the streets of the Imperial City and being hailed as the champion of the arena, or getting chased by guards for miles for stealing a sword at the local weapon shop.Different games, of course, offer different experiences in each of these areas, and in later posts I'm going to talk extensively about what makes a \"good\" leveling policy, a good equipment system, good dialog, and so forth. But these, at least, are the basic elements that have made me an addict.Note: after writing the above, I found this excellent post on the same subject. [Ed. The author has since removed it.] The author, Matt Barton, agrees with me on many of the above points and also includes a few more, including a magic system (I agree that almost all CPRGs have them, but there are a few sci-fi and historical ones that don't) and a \"medical system\" (essentially, hit points and ways to regain hit points). Read his \"key contentions\" section: this is what i want to discuss coming up."}, {"title": "Game 8: Exodus: Ultima III (1983)", "date": "Monday, March 8, 2010", "text": "Exodus: Ultima IIIUnited StatesORIGIN Systems (developer and publisher)Released in 1983 for Apple II, Atari 800, and Commodore 64; 1985 for DOS, Macintosh, PC-88, and PC-98; 1986 for FM-7, Amiga, and Atari ST; 1987 for NES; 1989 for Sharp X1Date Started: 7 March 2010\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My first impressions of Ultima III are that it redeems Ultima II. It feels like a real game instead of Richard Garriott screwing around. It (at least so far) keeps the game grounded in more standard fantasy conventions without involving light swords and rocketships. Combat is more tactical and interesting (if longer), equipment and items are more varied, the magic system is more sophisticated, dungeons have a reason to exist, and the overall gameplay, to me, is a lot more satisfying. This is the first game from Origin Systems, Richard Garriott's company;  his first two games were published by established game producers.Ultima III was released in 1983 for the Apple II, the Atari, and the Commodore 64. I'm playing a DOS port from two years later. In fairness, I should mention that I also downloaded and installed a graphics and sound upgrade package designed by some cool programmers over a decade ago. Compare the screen shot above to the original below, and you'll see why.Ultima III begins an era of games in which it really pays to read the manually carefully first. The manual and its accoutrements are one of the things that Garriott and Origin really excelled at. Each game in the original series came with a hand-drawn cloth map (I read somewhere that it took Garriott a long time to find a publisher for Ultima II because he insisted that they produce the cloth map with every game) and an ornately-decorated, magniloquently-written game manual. Consider the opening paragraphs of the manual:Welcome back, oh illustrious adventurers! Long has been thy sojourn  in this strange realm, though 'tis a fitting respite for great heroes.  Glorious are the names of those adventurers who slew the mighty Wizard  Mondain and his evil consort Minax. Lord British's minstrels still sing  thy praises for the epic battles waged in the overthrowing of those two  crimson necromancers. The chronicles of Ultima I and Ultima II bear  witness to thine effects on behalf of the good subjects of the realm of  Sosaria.\"The time of thy rest is now o'er. Thou wouldst not be here if thou  hadst not heard the distant braying of the war horns, or felt in thy  blood the cry of kinsmen in dire peril. Thou art Called, and from such a  Calling none of the People may turn aside. It is thy duty and thy  destiny.Aside from the fact that Ultima II has nothing to do with Sosaria, it's beautiful prose. Sometimes, they go a bit campy with their metaphors. Nothing beats: \"With the fall of Mondain and Minax, peace had flowed like molten honey around all of Sosaria.\" Yes, there's nothing like the molten honey of peace.The basic setup is that a new evil, called Exodus, the \"child\" (either metaphorically or actually) of Mondain and Minax has appeared on an island of lava in the middle of the ocean. None know whether Exodus is \"man, monster, or daemon.\" The only way we know its name is that the word \"EXODUS\" was found written in blood on the deck of a ship from which all crew had vanished, \"as if plucked by some evil force.\" Also, a \"shattered man found wandering the groves\" outside Lord British's castle had this to say: \"from the depths of Hell, he comes for vengeance.\" I tell you, I just eat this stuff up. In a modern game, this would all be handled with a cut scene, but I almost find the manual more fun.Nothing compares to the spell manuals, though. Ultima III follows Wizardry's (and, for that matter, Dungeons & Dragons's) example of dividing spells into priest spells and wizard spells (or holy magic and arcane magic, if you prefer). In-game, you cast a spell by specifying the character and the spell letter. There are 16 spells on each side, each with a letter from A to P. Cleric A is turn undead while wizard C is light. But, God, how the spell book describes them!I didn't put this much effort into my wedding vows.To cast a light spell--or \"Lorum,\" as the book has it--you don't just type (c)ast and \"c\": you chant \"obrey uricum obla sum\" while casting into the air a small portion of lorum dust, collected from \"a spider's bath, which has been warmed by strong sun for many hours.\" This is art, people. I almost feel bad that I created a little text file as a reference. There are a couple wizard spells so thickly described that I still have no idea what they actually do.Ultima III is the first game in the series to allow multiple party members, and the classes and races have been expanded to include some that will not only never occur in any other Ultima game but as far as I can tell never occur in any game. For instance, one race is a \"fuzzy\"--literally little furry creatures--that I suppose could become the emps of Ultima VII but are never a player race again. In addition to fighters, thieves, wizards, and clerics, classes include paladins, barbarians, larks (basically a synonym for bard), illusionists, druids, alchemists, and rangers. Each has a different combination of combat and magic skills, so you have to choose carefully.Gameplay is in some ways very similar to the previous Ultimas, with a top-down perspective and with actions tied to single keyboard letters. There is more depth to the game world, though, including an early type of \"fog of war\": you can't see around corners or through dense wooded areas or across mountains. There's also a mysterious (o)ther action command that allows you to do special things you have to discover along the way.Combat is what makes this Ultima stand out from the others. During the main part of the game, your party of four is represented by a single icon, but when you enter combat, you become four distinct party members, each of which performs an action in turn, including fighting or casting. There are both ranged and melee weapons, plus a wide variety of offensive and defensive spells (although limited spell points), so battle is far more tactical than in many other games of the era. One annoying thing is that monsters can attack diagonally but you cannot. Different icons represent different character types so it's easy to figure out whose turn it is. I'm pretty sure this style of combat remains all the way through Ultima V.As with previous Ultimas, dungeons are first-person, although a little more interesting in color and items. But the series continues its obsession with food, and keeping from starving is just as difficult as it was in Ultima II--more so, in some cases, because in the dungeons you keep running into gremlins which steal it.Hit points are dependent upon leveling, not upon bribing the nearest sovereign. You increase in levels by visiting Lord British, who as usual provides no helpful information. I note that Iolo, Gwino, and--making an appearance for the first time--Chuckles are all found in Lord British's castle, and it doesn't look like I'm going to have to kill them this time.You're not going to demand a tribute from me?In the early stages of the game, I've been exploring and mapping Sosaria--which isn't all that large--visiting towns, and getting clues from the locals. As with Ultima II, each person gives you exactly one line of dialog and most of them offer stock responds (although not as dumb or annoying as in Ultima II). From those that have something original to say, I've learned that Exodus lies beyond the silver snake, and I'll need to find exotic arms to defeat him, as only they will protect me from great evil. Other clues--and I'm not sure how they relate yet--tell me to seek a place called Ambrosia, seek the Shrines of Truth, journey through a whirlpool (I have a feeling these are all related), seek the jester in the Castle of Fire, and to find \"marks\" and \"cards.\" There are apparently four of the latter, and I need to use the  command to stick them into panels somewhere.I haven't gotten a ship yet, and I can see towns and dungeons off shore, so I need to find a frigate next.One word on the mapping: the game isn't conducive to graph paper, so I imported the cloth map as a raster image into a geographic information system (GIS) program called MapInfo Professional. I then created a vector layer to draw on top of the map, so I can note the locations of towns and their names. Overkill?  Perhaps. But fun."}, {"title": "Next Games", "date": "Sunday, March 7, 2010", "text": "After getting some actual work done this morning, I downloaded the next game on my chronology: Wizardry II. By all accounts, it is exactly the same game as Wizardry but with a different dungeon. This is so much the case, I discovered, that you can't even create new characters in it. You have to import them from Wizardry.

The Internet is surprisingly of no help: I found a guy on a message board that was having the same problem, but he didn't get a solution except a suggestion to purchase The Ultimate Wizardry Archives.

I thought the first Ultima was a quaint little lark whose air cars and tie fighters and jestercide were, if occasionally silly, still part of its charm. Ultima II, on the other hand, is a senseless travesty of a game that improves nothing on its predecessor and in fact makes things a great deal worse. How is this only two steps away from the awesome Ultima IV? (Please, please don't tell me that Ultima IV isn't as awesome as I remember.)Let's start with the basic premise. Mondain has been defeated, the game manual tells us, but he left behind an apprentice: Minax, a powerful enchantress whose vengeance brought, in 2111, a (presumably nuclear) apocalypse across the face of the Earth. Through time doors, fortunately, the inhabitants of that grisly future were able to escape back . . .Wait. What? Earth? Yep. The game takes place mostly on Earth in five different time periods, each accessible to each other through a series of \"time gates.\" The time zones are \"Panagea,\" or two million years before the present, when all the Earth's continents were fused; the medieval ages, the year 1990, the post-apocalyptic year 2112, and the \"Age of Legends,\" or the beginning of time, where Minax has her castle. The entire world is the game map.  After you create your character, you are dumped unceremoniously into a washed-out and barren landscape with no goals and a limited quantity of food. I started exploring, and in far less time than makes any sense, I had hiked from Tierra del Fuego to the tip of Italy, crossing the Bering Land Bridge on the way. Right.Look, I know it's early in the development of CRPGs. The existence of \"experience points\" that do absolutely nothing for you doesn't bother me. The limited character development doesn't bother me. The existence of only six spells doesn't bother me. But could the story at least make some modicum of sense? Could the manual not talk up Lord British as a benevolent sovereign and then introduce me to a man who requires that I give him money for hit points? Could the game not involve shuttle missions to Jupiter, which the game manual helpfully indicates is covered with \"water and grass\"?!Not water and grass.Creating a character in Ultima II is a process of building your attributes from a pool of points and then choosing your race, class, and name. The sex, race, and class choices affect your starting attributes and nothing else.The gameplay is similar to Ultima I. Dungeons and towers are first-person, but outdoors and town areas are top-down. You control your character with keyboard commands--every letter of the alphabet seems to do something, from (A)ttack to (Z)tats. Many of the commands only work in certain circumstances, like (H)yper, (L)aunch, and (N)egate time.The game manual spends a lot of time describing each monster in lurid detail, but when the monsters attack you in the game world, the game doesn't even bother to tell you what they are. Combat consists of pounding (A)ttack repeatedly until they die. A little disappointing after the complexity of Wizardry.Our hero is attacked by orcs. Or bears.Unlike Ultima I, in this game you can talk to all of the characters, and each gives you a couple of words of dialog. Most of them have nothing particularly interesting to say. All the clerics say, \"Believe!\" and fighters say, \"Ugh. Me tough!\" The merchants say, \"Will you buy my apples?\" while the guards say, \"Pay your taxes!\" Wizards are most annoying: \"Hex-e-poo-hex-on-you!\" When the game diverts from these stock responses, it's usually to introduce some kind of in-joke.Helpful. Thanks.I know many readers are looking forward to post after post on Ultima II, so I hate to disappoint you, but I went ahead and won it in a single day. This is a day in which I also played four hours of Telengard, wrote 12 pages for a report due at work next week, and read three chapters in a book about inferential statistics. Ultima II is not a demanding game, except perhaps on your tolerance for its idiocies.I was unreasonably proud of my boat bridge from France to Greenland.Winning the game requires the following:1. Visiting towns in four of the five eras and speaking to everyone so that you get the few hints that you need from the few people who don't spout nonsense.2. Acquiring a stock of items: brass buttons and skull keys to fly planes, blue tassels to commandeer ships, trilithiums to engage the hyperspace drives on rockets, and so on. Thieves carry these items, and so you have to kill a lot of thieves.3. Building up massive amounts of gold so you can buy enough hit points to survive the final encounter, increase your statistics, and buy the weapons and armor you need. This by far is the longest part of the game. Fairly early, you can commandeer a frigate in each time period and you spend most of the game sailing around in your frigate and firing cannon volleys at hapless monsters that literally line up to be gunned down. You are in no danger of death during this process. If the game had consisted solely of the player typing the letter \"F\" 7,500 times in a Notepad file, it wouldn't be any more boring.This screen shot didn't change for almost two hours.4. Bribing the desk clerk at the Hotel California in New San Antonio (and yes, the desk clerk even \"welcomes\" you) in 1990 to raise your agility, strength, and other statistics so that, among other things, you can wield the Minax-slaying weapon and wear the space armor.5. Bribing Lord British to get your max hit point total.Tribute?! You arrogant bastard, you brought me here!6. Slaying a couple of benighted guards to acquire their keys--the only items you can't get from thieves--so you can break into the prison in New San Antonio and bribe a prisoner to give you the Quicksword \"Enilno,\" which you need to kill Minax. \"Enilno\" is, of course, \"online\" backwards. But what I want to know is what did \"online\" even mean in 1982?7. Buying some \"power armor\" which lets you survive in space.8. Journeying to Moscow in 2112--complete with \"Da Red Skwere\" and \"Da KGB\"--to steal first a bi-plane, which requires murdering the owner of the airfield. You then fly the bi-plane to another part of the same town to steal a rocketship to journey to Planet X, upon which there is a castle in which a guy named Father Antos gives you his blessing, allowing you to return to Earth to meet Brother Antos and get from him a ring that protects you from the magic barriers in Minax's castle. I really, really don't blame you if you stopped reading somewhere in there.What significance that Earth's coordinates are 6-6-6?9. Going to Minax's castle in the Time of Legends, avoiding her guards, and killing her with the Quicksword. This involves finding her throne room, enduring her magic missile blasts, and hitting her once, at which point she disappears and reappears in another room at the other end of the castle. You then have to journey there and hit her again, only to have her disappear again and return to the first room. Repeat six or seven times.I like to imagine she was speaking German here.If all that didn't sound stupid enough, here are some other points:Spells only work in dungeons, and since there's absolutely no reason to go in the dungeons (you don't get hit points for it like you do in Ultima I), there's no reason to be a wizard or priest.I only went in here to take this screen shotAs with Ultima I, you start the game starving and have to keep buying food. Unlike Ultima I, though, you don't amass gold quickly enough to keep up with your food use. So you basically have to steal it. Fortunately, there's a fish & chips place in what I guess is Namibia where you can steal food all day long and run away as soon as the guards come after you, then re-enter the town and repeat.A druid in one town says, \"Anol nathrac uth das bessod dien doch dientes.\" If you're going to pay homage to Excalibur, at least get it right: \"An-al nathrach, urth vas bethud, doch-hiel dienve.\"You can travel to each of the nine planets in our solar system (Pluto was still considered a planet in 1982), land your space shuttle, walk around, and encounter orcs and thieves and pirate ships. In fact, most of the planets re-use the same maps as Earth, including its towns and changes you've made to the physical world, such as acquiring frigates and bi-planes. The one and only difference is you can't save on them.One of the planets--Uranus or Neptune--has a castle consisting only of jesters who surround you and force you to kill them to escape.The game is full of really, really dumb inside jokes and pop-culture references.You're making a pop culture reference to Warren Beatty? Really?The thing that made Ultima I the most fun is how you encountered people and places that reoccur in later Ultimas: Montor, Paws, Shamino, the White Dragon's Castle. None of that for Ultima II. As far as I can tell (and I admit I didn't keep a careful log), the only recurring characters are Lord British, Iolo, and Gwenno. The latter two are encased in a grassy area in...I don't know. One of the towns. Remembering how I killed Gwenno for her key in Ultima I and having by now fully internalized my role as a serial killer, I landed a bi-plane in the grassy area and hacked them both to death.One day, I shall return as the Avatar and we will be best friends. Today is not that day.Even if you're an Ultima fan--hell, especially if you're an Ultima fan--I encourage you not to play this game. I've played many games with boring gameplay and many games with idiotic plots. It is a rare to find one that combines both.Here are the end game screen shots so I can prove I really won. I wasn't inspired enough to screen record it.\u00a0Does anyone know what the ]II[ - P is referring to?****\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further reading: My posts on the entire Ultima series: Akalabeth (1980), Ultima (1981), Ultima II (1982), Ultima III (1983), Ultima IV (1985), Ultima V (1988), Ultima VI (1990), Ultima VII (1992), Ultima Underworld (1992), and somewhere in there we have the dreadful Ultima: Escape from Mount Drash (1983).

For a while, I assumed there was no reason not to just hang around the stairs to an inn, since every square held the potential for random encounters and random treasure every turn. It turns out the dungeons are full of interesting--and generally deadly--things. Some things I've discovered since my last post:Pits that sometimes give you the option to climb down, sometimes just unceremoniously toss you downTeleporters that send you to random locationsMonsters that do what they typically do in D&D-derived games. Dragons coat you with fire, ghouls immobilize you, vampires sap away your hard-won experience points, and so on. Not all monsters kill you, though. Hobbits and skeletons (?) occasionally steal your stuff, and more than once I met an elf who, disturbingly, healed me to full strength because he \"liked my body.\" A nice dragon gave me a sword +2.Chests with buttons of four different colors. You have to figure out the appropriate pattern--getting zapped every time you get it wrong--for the chest to open. Goodly amounts of treasure inside those.Holy altars. Give them enough money and they cast beneficial spells on you. Give them too little money, or no money, or try to walk on by them, and they call you \"dirty pagan trash\" and summon undead to kill you.\"Scrolls of rescue\" that return you to inns. I thought these were going to be my salvation, but they take away all your gold which, since gold is one of the primary ways to build experience points, is very bad.Fountains that alternately contain healing waters and poison.\"Jewel-encrusted\" thrones that  give you the option to (r)ead runes, (s)it on them, or (p)ry the gems,  with randomized chances of different things happening depending on what  you do. Once, when I read the runes, I got +1 wisdom. A second time, I  somehow brought about the return of the \"ghoul king,\" who promptly  slaughtered me.Would any adventurer worth his salt hit (i) right now?These different things make the game fun and fast-paced and, I admit, slightly addictive--at least, once you get your hero up to level 3 or 4 and stop dying every step.Telengard isn't really a game you play for a long time, since there's no way to \"win.\" Instead, it's a game you blow an hour or two on here or there, perhaps competing for highest score or fastest leveling with a friend. The manual actually encourages this with several suggestions for \"multi-player\" games: \"see which player can advance his character to the highest experience level in a given time period\"; \"see who can map the most dungeon spaces of a given dungeon level\" (this is followed by the helpful suggestion to \"use graph paper\").Lacking any friends who are likely to want to play Telengard, I don't really have any reason to keep going with it. It might be fun to see if I can get to level 10 or level 12, but death can strike any time, and it's discouraging to have to keep starting over. In six hours of gameplay and probably 100 characters, the highest I was able to climb was level 8 (alas, forgot to take screenshots). After that character died, I gamely tried again. Helped by a ring of regeneration +4 that I found early on, I managed to get Arturos up to level 6. Then I found a \"misty box\" that asked me to enter a random number. I did, and found myself teleported to a much lower fathom of the dungeon, where I was immediately slain by a level 25 fighter.Next game.*****Further Reading: As I progressed in my chronology, I found that Telengard is a commercial version of a long line of games stretching back to a 1975 PLATO game called The Game of Dungeons or dnd. Daniel Lawrence, the creator of Telengard, copied elements from the PLATO titles and developed Dungeons & Dragons (c. 1977) for DEC mainframes, then later tried to commercialize it as Telengard (1982). Other games in this line include Dungeon of Death (1979), Dungeons and Dragons for Heathkit DOS (1981), The Standing Stones (1983), Caverns of Zoarre (1984), and DND (1984).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TelengardUnited StatesMicrocomputer Games (developer); Avalon Hill (publisher)Released in 1982 for Apple II, Commodore PET, and TRS-80; 1983 for Atari 800, Commodore 64, and FM-7; 1984 for CP/M, PC-88, and PC-98; 1985 for DOSDate Started: 5 March 2010\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Modern  CRPGs are for wimps, aren't they? I mean, you start out in some safe  little nest, hear your back story, and immediately get a quest that  involves killing rats. In no time, you're level six and fireballing  kobolds. Where's the challenge?Compare that to Telengard. Here is a full transcript  of my first adventure.Game:  Your name, noble sire?Me:  ArturosGame: You are now  descending into the depths of the Telengard dungeon.Game: Do you want to go (u)p, (d)own,  or (s)tay on the same level?Me:  (S)tayMe: NorthGame: You see a level 3 dragon.

Do you wish to play again?Wow.This  game is crazy. I had some more  success with further characters, but I keep dying while I stop to type  this blog post. Why? Because although the game is turn-based, it  automatically does something for you  whenever you don't press a key after five seconds. And there's no way to pause it! I'm  trying to make notes for this entry, and a skeleton just killed me.Every  time you hang out for a turn in a square, there's a chance of finding  treasure in that square. Without even leaving the stairs at the bottom  of the inn, I found over 1000 gold, a ring of protection +2 and a ring  of regeneration +1. Six monsters came along and tried to kill me.  Finally, a mummy succeeded.What about rats? Don't you have any rats?This  game is crazy.All  right. I'd better back up. From all appearances, Telegard is a  \"Roguelike\" game in which you wander around a dungeon, fight monsters,  and collect goodies and treasure. [Edit: I didn't know what I was talking about back in 2010. This game is emphatically not a roguelike. It is part of the DND line that started with the PLATO Game of Dungeons. See the links at the bottom for more.] The manual sets up the adventure with  the typical dramatic language of the era:I am, alas, to be another of the foolish  ones. A whole legion of them, really.You begin by randomly rolling some  character stats and giving yourself a name. That's it; no race or class  choices.As in Rogue, you can save your  character, but every time you reload the game, it deletes the save file.  Hence, death is permanent. And, as in Rogue,  frequent. This is the only game I've ever played in which there's  actually a keyboard  command to commit suicide. (I'm not making that  up.) Trust me, when you encounter a level 3 giant mere seconds after you  created your character, there's not much else to do.In Telengard,  you see this screen a lot.Gold  is copious but worthless in the sense that you can't buy anything. But  it appears that every time you ascend to an inn, the game converts your  accumulated gold to experience points, which is swell. Not that  experience points stop me from turning the corner and wandering into  level 4 dragons.I found out the hard way that you can't collect  multiple swords, rings, shields, etc. When you pick up an item from the  floor, it automatically replaces whatever you were carrying. Since you  only have a few seconds to decide, you want to be very careful. Not that  that sword +2 really does anything against the level 5 minotaur.There  are spells in the game which you collect as you advance experience  levels. They're standard D&D fare: level 1 includes magic missile,  sleep, and cure light wounds. Casting them is dependent upon \"spell  units.\" I haven't lived long enough to figure out how or if these  regenerate.I'm sorry to keep harping on this, but you die so  often in Telengard it has to be  seen to be believed. Here's a video of about four minutes of gameplay. I  think I die five times.Telengard and I are not going to be  friends. I just came from a punishingly difficult game and I'm not much  in the mood for another one. Since there doesn't seem to be any way to  \"win\" Telengard, I'll give it  my six hours, see how high a character level I can achieve and how low a  dungeon level I can explore, and then move on.***** Further Reading: As I progressed in my chronology, I found that Telengard is a commercial version of a long line of games stretching back to a 1975 PLATO game called The Game of Dungeons or dnd.

Sit down for this one. I just won Wizardry. Trust me, I'm as surprised as you are. I thought it would take all night. My characters were only Level 11--I didn't even have the top level of spells yet.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The first thing you have to understand about how this happened is that for all the mapping you do, it's frightfully simple to get to the end game. Once you have something called a blue ribbon, which which lets you use the elevators, you can go all the way down to Level 9 in about 15 moves. And once one party has the ability to get the blue ribbon, it can get multiple copies of it, holding some in reserve with dummy characters for new parties. Fortunately, that's what I did.After you get to Level 9, it's exactly five moves and one battle to get to the chute that dumps you down to Level 10. From there, in theory, you make your way through the level to the evil wizard Werdna.How did I win the game so fast? It was all thanks to my useless, stupid thief. You see, the monsters on Level 9 aren't all that hard, and some of them are giants, which give absurd amounts of experience points for little effort. After I achieved level 11 with my characters (which took almost all day), I figured I'd just hang out on Level 9 slaying giants until I reached level 15.Well, I accidentally wandered onto the invisible chute to Level 10. I was going to head for the nearest teleporter (Level 10 is full of them) to return myself to the town, but I was attacked immediately by a party consisting of one priest. I dealt with him with no problem.The priest left a chest, and my idiotic thief identified the trap on the chest as a poison needle, so I tried to disarm it. As usual, my thief was wrong--the trap on the chest was a teleporter. Teleporter traps, as you might expect, teleport you to a random place on the same level. In my case, it teleported me directly into the lair of Werdna!Werdna came at me with a vampire lord and three vampires. I started attacking him with everything I had. By the time I realized I might win, and thought to record it, I was halfway through the battle, but the video below shows the rest.At 00:25, I kill the remaining vampires with some high-level spells,  leaving only Werdna. I assailed him with fighters and powerful area  effect spells. There are a lot of pauses in here as I try to figure out  the best spells to use. Werdna whacks me with a MADALTO at 01:30,  killing two of my characters, but at that time he's pretty weak, and my  bishop kills him with a very weak MOLITO. I get the Amulet of Werdna.At  02:25, you see me try to raise one of my dead characters--it never  feels right to win the game when some of your characters are dead--but  as usual it goes wrong and he turns to ash. Then I spend about a minute  trying to figure out how to get off the level before I realize that I  have to use the Amulet of Werdna to teleport myself. I haven't used  teleport yet--it's one of the last spells you get, and I never got  it--so it took me some time to figure it out. But ultimately I return to  the castle and get the coveted \"you won\" screen at 03:50.For  reasons I don't understand, only two of my characters are around at this  point, and I spent a few seconds trying to heal the others before  saying screw it, I won the game. And I never had to map Level 10. As  much as I'd like to do that and get those last spell levels--I really  wanted to have the experience of clearing out multiple groups of  monsters at one time with a TILTOWAIT spell--I know that upon my first  death, I'd get frustrated and move on--so I think I'll do that  preemptively.Closing ThoughtsIt helps that there's only one dungeon in Wizardry and the dungeon is relatively simple to navigate. If Wizardry had been the size of, say, Might and Magic VII or Neverwinter Nights and insisted on permanent death with no reloading, I wouldn't have lasted very long.As I said in my introductory post, I like games that are a little difficult. And when they aren't difficult enough, I make them more difficult by forcing myself to save only once per screen/level or something like that. But Wizardry goes a bit too far. I'm glad that its attitudes towards death and saving did not propagate to later CRPGs.But let's give Wizardry the credit that it deserves. It is, as far as I can tell, the first CRPG to feature:Multiple characters in a partyExperience points and levels the way we think of them in CRPGs todayMultiple foes at the same timeA complex magic system (on both the sending and the receiving ends!)Separate spells for mages and priestsTactical combatMultiple types of items--weapons, armor, helms, accessories--that you can find and wield.Items that must be identifiedCursed itemsA full list of D&D-style races and classesClasses restricted based on ability scoresAlignments (I could be wrong about this)The ability to change classes (which I didn't do)\u00a0 Many of these features, of course, are derived from the pen-and-paper role-playing games (primarily Dungeons & Dragons) that existed in the era, but that's the point: Wizardry proved that complex D&D style role-playing could be adapted to a computer environment.As a landmark in the history of CRPGs, it was fun and interesting to play. I'm not sorry I did. But neither am I sorry I played it only once.On to Telengard.One Last EditI was closing out my map file, and I suddenly realized why the architecture of Level 9 struck me as so weird: the creator of the game put his initials in the map: RJW. I think I remember something like this in Might and Magic I.\u00a0***For further reading: My coverage of Wizardry: Scenario #2 - The Knight of Diamonds (1982), Wizardry: Scenario #3 - The Legacy of Llylgamyn (1983), The Return of Werdna: The Fourth Wizardry Scenario (1986), Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom (1988), Wizardry: Bane of the Cosmic Forge (1990), Wizardry: Crusaders of the Dark Savant (1992). We also look at the first Japanese Wizardry game in Wizardry: Suffering of the Queen (1991) and a guest post on \"The Long Life of the Original Wizardry in Japan.\" Learn more about Wizardry's source in my coverage of Oubliette (1977). Games and Series influenced by Wizardry include The Bard's Tale (1985) and Might and Magic (1986).It's the dying that gets you in this game. If you could avoid dying--if  you could save before battles and re-load if they went poorly--then I'm  convinced you could beat Wizardry  in a single long day of playing (I say this without having attempted  Level 10 yet). We're only talking about ten 20x20 dungeon levels, after  all. But without cheating, Wizardry is  a real nail-biter. Some review, with new material I've discovered since  then: The game saves your progress for you. There's no way to \"reload\" after a  bad battle. If one character dies in combat, you either have to raise him with the  DI spell or haul him back up to the surface to get raised at the temple.If you use the DI spell, there's a chance it will fail, turning your character to ash, requiring you to pay even more to get him resurrected. I say \"there's a chance,\" but in fact DI has not worked a single time I have tried to use it. I finally just gave up. Every death requires a trip to the surface.There's a spell called KADORTO that allows you to do your own resurrection, but if it fails, your character is gone for good. Not worth the risk, especially since DI never works.If your entire party is killed, you have to send a search party down into the dungeons to retrieve their bodies. Problem is, most deaths will occur at locations of fixed battles, so your relief party will have to fight the same battle that wiped out your first party. You therefore have to have relief characters as strong as the original party.If your relief party is similarly wiped out, you're screwed. It's back to Level 1 with a brand new party.The specter of permanent death consequently makes Wizardry the most tactical game I have ever played. You can't half-ass any battle because, trust me on this, you really, really don't want to die. This means that you have to carefully contemplate every action.Consider this screen shot from the beginning of a battle.As with every battle, my goal is to wipe out these foes while minimizing damage to myself. There are two other considerations to add to the mix:My spellcasters have a limited number of spells. You only replenish spells when you revisit the surface (which is kind of a pain in the neck). So you want to use as few spells as possible in each battle, saving your high-level spells for the battles that really need them.For a few rounds, I won't know what groups 1 and 3 are. The \"men in leather\" are some kind of thief class and the \"men in armor\" are some kind of samurai or fighter class--I can tell this easy enough from the pictures. But I don't know what levels they are or, hence, how powerful they are.So how do I approach this? My first characters, Karsa and Gruntle, are fighters, and as such they can pretty much just attack. But who should I attack first?Crokus is a thief. His options are really just attack and parry. His hit points are quite low, so perhaps I should parry this battle, although I hate to lose out on the chance to make an attack.Itkhovian is my priest. He can't attack, since he's not in the first three ranks, but here are a lot of things he can do, and all of them seem like good options. First, he could cast a healing spell on Crokus and limit the odds that Crokus will get killed this round. Or he could cast MANIFO to try to paralyze one of the three groups. I could also have him cast MONTINO to silence the arch mages, but if I'm more concerned about the fighters perhaps I should have him cast BAMATU to lower my party's armor class. Or I could ask him to cast LATUMAPIC to identify the monsters, but I'll probably identify them automatically next round anyway.Tattersail is a mage. Almost certainly the best use of her is to cast a spell that damages all members of a group. The question is: what level do I want to cast? MAHALITO does 4-24 damage, LAHALITO 6-36, and MADALTO 8-64. I have fewer of the high level ones, so I don't want to waste them. But I also don't want to cast an underpowered spell and leave a group of six archmages alive to cast the same spells against me.Feather Witch, finally, is a bishop, meaning that she has both mage and priest spells but at lower levels. Good options for her are KATINO, which attempts to sleep a group, MOGREF, which reduces everyone's armor class, or MORLIS, which makes monsters easier to hit. She can also cast one or two MAHALITOs, so perhaps I should use her for that.In this case, I decided that the archmages were the top priority, but I'd try to wipe them out with spells. The \"men in armor,\" if high-level, could do some serious damage, but the \"men in leather\" were probably thieves and low priority. I had Tattersail MADALTO the archmages, told Itkhovian to paralyze the fighters, and had Feather Witch MAHALITO the archmages just in case some survived Tattersail. Gruntle and Karsa attacked the thieves while Crokus parried.I forgot to take screen shots of the rest of the battle, but basically Itkhovian's paralyze only worked on a couple of the fighters. Crokus, despite his parrying, was killed by the fighters. Tattersail's spell did its trick and killed all of the mages, meaning Feather Witch's spell was wasted--I should have had her heal Crokus instead. In the next two rounds, I finished off the thieves and fighters and headed up to the surface to raise Crokus.It's not only in battle that tactics come into play. The aftermath of every battle involves an agonizing decision about whether I should try to open the chest or ignore it. On one hand, if I don't open it, I won't get any better equipment (gold isn't a problem any more), but on the other hand, there's a really good chance that my worthless thief will either misidentify or fail to disarm the trap. The possible consequences of this are:Everybody gets poisoned by a gas bomb (requiring, yes, a trip back up to the surface)My entire party gets wiped out by an exploding box trapCrokus, Itkhovian, or Tattersail are taken out of commission by a crossbow bolt, a priest blaster, or a mage blaster, respectivelyA teleport trap tosses my characters into a part of the dungeon I haven't mapped, and therefore don't know the way back to the elevator to the surface (very dangerous; the way back to the surface is a constant lifeline for me)An alarm trap summons more parties of monstersI've learned not to even try to open chests when my party is weak.Since I blogged about Wizardry last time, I lost both my main party and my relief party and had to start all over. It's not as bad as it sounds. Mapping took longer than actually playing, and with the maps already done, I just need to build up my character levels. There are a couple of ghosts on level 1 that give a lot of experience while doing very little damage, so I've basically been killing the ghosts over and over while doing other things in the background.My last party died on Level 9 and I had almost finished mapping it. I actually did touch Level 10--the last level--when I got dumped there by an invisible chute, but a teleporter brought me immediately back up to the castle. The lower levels started to introduce a lot of nastiness, including dead-magic zones, pit traps that did serious damage, level-draining monsters, and constant teleporters. For someone who likes mapping as much as I do, teleporters are a constant annoyance.My plan for now is to carefully build my characters up to level 15, then finish mapping Level 9 of the dungeon and try my luck against Werdna. I'm rotating my characters again, with three complete parties this time, so it will take a while, but if I keep at it all night (read the name of my blog again), I still might be able to win this thing by tomorrow. Wish me luck."}, {"title": "Wizardry: Making Progress", "date": "Thursday, March 4, 2010", "text": "Yay! After 20 hours of playing, I can start my quest!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I can't fully decide why I'm still playing Wizardry (although perhaps the title of my blog is a bit of a hint). It's a great example of an early CRPG, sure, and as I've mentioned before, I like mapping on a grid. But it's been a while since I've had what you might call \"fun.\" Am I really going to insist on playing this all the way to the end?When I last blogged, I was struggling with Level 3 of the dungeon and in particular the ninjas that kept decapitating my characters with one blow. I spent all my money raising these characters and was short on funds, so I decided to spend a while on earlier levels building experience so that my priest would finally get the DI (restore life) spell and be able to raise characters himself. Fortunately, there's this little nook on Level 1 where you can repeatedly search and encounter one or two \"Murphy's Ghosts\" (I wonder if there's a story behind the name). They're hard to hit, but do very little damage themselves, and they reward you with a reasonable amount of experience. After I finally slaughtered an entire legion of them, I had not only the DI spell but, at last, the LATUMOFIS spell, which cures poison.Well, anyway, joke's on me. While the DI spell does occasionally raise your dead characters, equally as often it fails and turns them to ash! You then have to spend absurd amounts of money fully resurrecting them from the ash state. I nearly deleted the game at this point.Fortunately, I persevered, and finished mapping Levels 3 and 4. A few important things happen on Level 4:You have an inescapable encounter with a party consisting of two high-level fighters, two high-level mages, two high-level priests, and one high-level ninja.Although things seem to be going ominously for me at this point, I actually won this encounter.If you can get by this encounter, your money woes are over, because one of your slain foes carries a \"Ring of DEATH!\" (yes, the exclamation point is part of its name) which sells for 250,000 gold.Gods know why a cursed ring that kills you is worth so much.On the other side of this encounter, you reach the end of the \"proving grounds\" and receive your quest from Lord Trebor, the screen shot of which I posted at the beginning of this entry.Not having to worry any more about how to pay for resurrection is a bit of a relief, as is not having to climb all the way up to the town every time one of my characters gets poisoned. I've been able to map the rest of Level 4 and most of Level 5. It's probably a bad idea, but I've stopped rotating my characters, too, since I no longer encounter battles in which my entire party is wiped out (and is unable to flee).On the bad side, there's a certain paucity of valuable equipment in this game. Almost halfway through the levels, the best weapon my party has is a sword+1. And my worthless thief still trips practically every trap.On the latest level, I started encountering shades, which drain your levels. Until now, I thought poison was the most annoying effect. Unlike with, say, Dungeons & Dragons games, there's no spell to restore your lost levels. God, I hate that.Finally, I'll mention that a little late in the game, I figured out why I'd bother to carry around scrolls of HALITO (flame) and KATINO (strength) when my mages can cast these spells about 20 times. It turns out that when you stumble upon an encounter and you surprise the monsters, your spellcasters can't cast any spells for the first round, in which the monsters can't act. However, they can use magical items. I wish I'd realized this ages ago.Having typed all of this, I have a feeling I'm getting way too much into the minutiae of the game to be of any interest to anyone reading this blog. If I'm wrong, let me know.  I'm going to try to make a push to win it over the next few days. If all goes according to plan, I'll be back on Saturday with the good news."}, {"title": "What's in a Name?", "date": "Monday, March 1, 2010", "text": "\"Hrrrrgggg...hey, how are you?..grrrrrr....nice weather we're having.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You may have noticed from my Wizardry screen shot yesterday that my characters' names come from the Malazan Book of the Fallen series by Steven Erikson. I highly recommend the series, although the first novel, Gardens of the Moon, has a steep learning curve. I suppose if you're a Malazan purist, you object to me putting these six characters--who, in the series, are on completely different continents--in the same party. My first party, which was all Bridgeburners, was slaughtered on day one.Determining your characters' names is generally one of the first steps of any CRPG. So it bears some thought on the best way to do it. There are a few reasons to invest time in coming up with good names:You're going to be staring at the names for 40+ hours and might as well make them something you find aesthetically pleasing.It helps you keep track of your character classes and sexes. This can be important in first-person games where you characters don't have their own icons, and in games in which you have more than one party (as I do in my current Wizardry session). In early CRPG's, it's one of the only elements of true \"role playing\"  in which you get to engage. Choosing the right name/race/class combination can bring life to an otherwise dull CRPG session, especially if you like to invent your own goals, quests, and character interactions like I do (I know, kid's stuff, but I find it fun).I sat down and made a list of all of the different ways I've come up with CRPG character names in the past. I'm curious how this compares to yours.My own name, altered. A character named \"Bradley\" (not my real name, but let's go with it) would be pretty boring. But we can anagram it and come up with \"Bladeyr,\" which, with the \"blade\" and all, sounds like a good name for a warrior. Or I can alter the suffix and use something like \"Bradlynd\" for a mage. My middle name happens to be the same name as an English castle and has the same ring of antiquity, so I often use it as my main character: think \"Lord Dorstone\" or \"Sir Pontefract.\"People you know, similarly altered (or not). If I have a crush on a girl named \"Susan,\" she might show up in my character roster as \"Zansu\" or something. I have a friend with the last name \"Getz,\" which I've used several time as an apt thief name.Characters from fantasy books. You've obviously seen an example above, but I also often use \"Lone Wolf\" (for a thief) and \"Grey Star\" (for a mage) from the 1980s series of gamebooks by Joe Dever that I remember fondly from my childhood. The works of Robert Jordan, George R. R. Martin, Brandon Sanderson, Robin Hobb, and of course J. R. R. Tolkien are also good character name mines.Characters from myth and legend. I have a particular weakness for Welsh mythology, so you'll see me using names like Branwen, Llyr, Owain, Gereint, and Taliesin. The Arthurian legends are another great set of sources for character names. I often make minor changes to add my own spin to the character: Merlyndus, Vivianna, Artorus, and so on.Characters from historical novels, books, television, and films. A character doesn't need to be from a fantasy source to make a good fantasy name. Over the years I've used Ivanhoe, Locksley, Quixote, Puck, Cressida, Orry (I've always liked the John Jakes North and South series), Dargo (Farscape--great series), and (once, when I was drunk) C. K. Dexter Haven. Shakespeare alone could fill your roster for dozens of games.Historical figures. Great if you want to match someone to a particular class. I used Paul of Thebes as a monk, Vlad as a vampire, Roland as a knight, and Calico Jack as a rogue.Character traits. A lot of descriptive words make good names: \"Sullen\" for a brooding fighter, \"Slink\" for a stealthy thief, and \"Grargh\" for a barely-vocal half-orc. Other languages provide ways to turn basic descriptors into names: \"Sanctus\" for a priest, \"Espada\" (\"blade\" in Spanish) for a fighter, \"Alta\" for a \"high\" elf, \"Hechizador\" for a mage.It's particularly fun, I think, to use a theme--name all the characters for a particular game using a single source. Hence my Malazan-inspired roster for Wizardry. I remember playing Might and Magic VII once with all characters from The Tempest: Prospero, Caliban, Miranda, and Ariel. I suppose if you had enough imagination, you could make a kind of fanfiction out of it. Name your Might and Magic party after \"SG-1\" characters and pretend their arrival on VARN is from a stargate.Deciding on a name, of course, is only half the job. You then have to decide what titles and sobriquets your characters deserve. Going with a Buffy-themed party? Make it Lord Xander, Caleb the Chosen, Bleak Faith, and of course William the Bloody.I think there's only one cardinal rule in choosing character names: to use the default characters, and default names, is the lamest thing you can do when playing a CRPG.One final thing: someone has posted a series of RPG name generators. I suppose if you were really stuck, you could go here, although I think not coming up with your own names is kind of lame. Still this offers some pretty good suggestions. I asked it to give me five elf names, and it came up with:Adegacl Leafjester,Anolnirh Songclaw,Nenanair Snakedreamer,Toraldebg  Glitterpaw, andTosall Fireeye.Decent.It's fun to see the evolution of how the game itself uses your character names. In the early games, since there's no dialog, the game could basically care less. More recent games, however, do a good job of inserting the names into the appropriate dialog spaces. The voice-over for the dialog usually breaks off when it reaches the name, or has some generic words instead (e.g., the text reads, \"Lord Bladeyr has saved us all!\" but the voice-over says, \"This hero has saved us all!\"). Even though your chosen name isn't fully integrated, I like it. If I spend 15 minutes mulling it over and decide to call my main character \"Lando,\" by God I want people in the game to refer to me as \"Lando.\""}, {"title": "Wizardry: Going Slow, Mapping", "date": "Sunday, February 28, 2010", "text": "I'm really having trouble picturing this encounter.I hope no one feared that my lack of posting this week signaled a waning interest in this project. It was, rather, a result of some unexpected business travel arriving right after some expected business travel. It's one thing to play games when you ought to be working on the quarterly report; it's another thing to do so when your colleagues are waiting for you in the bar.One thing is certain: Wizardry isn't going to go as fast as Ultima I. I have finished mapping two of what I guess are 10 levels, which sounds like I'm about 20% done, but I have a feeling it's going to get harder as I press forward. A few things I've discovered:My strategy of rotating my characters is working well. On the couple of occasions in which my entire party has been wiped out, it's been relatively easy (albeit slow and expensive) to rescue and resurrect them. Hopefully this deals with the permanent death problem through the rest of the game.Getting poisoned gets old fast. My useless rogue seems to trip every poison needle trap, and there are several creatures that poison you. My priest hasn't acquired the cure poison spell yet, so every poisoning means a trip back up to the surface. Thankfully, paralysis wasn't the problem that it used to be.Your characters age in this game, when they change classes or spend a week resting in the inn. I'm guessing there's a danger (if somewhat remote) if getting too old and dying. I remember that happening decades ago in Might and Magic. I can't think of other games where the characters get older.When you embark from the castle, your spellcasters have a certain allotment of spells per level. As far as I can tell, the only way to refresh this allotment is to return to the castle. This forces you to \"budget\" your spells as you adventure because there's no \"resting\" in the dungeon.Leveling is a bit odd. You have to rest in the inn to gain levels, and when you do your statistics change--not always for the better. Sometimes you gain strength but lose vitality, or gain agility but lose intelligence. I'm not sure how the game decides what you gain and lose. One theory is that it's based on what you used (e.g., someone who \"(f)ights\" a lot gains strength), but that seems awfully advanced for a CRPG of this era.What I really want to talk about tonight is mapping, though. It's one of the things I enjoy the most about old CRPGs and one of the things I miss the most when playing new ones. It would of course be functionally impossible to map Oblivion or Baldur's Gate without the automap, but manual mapping works great in these older, \"tile-based\" games.Wizardry levels are arranged on a 20 x 20 Cartesian grid and the DUMAPIC spell tells you where you are on the x- and y-axes. Games that I remember sharing these square, limited grids are the \"gold box\" Dungeons & Dragons games and the Might and Magic series through #5. This makes mapping them somewhat easy. As I posted before, I'm using Excel to draw the maps on the computer screen, although it's been hard to find a border style that makes a good door. I use letters to indicate special encounters.Level 2 of the Wizardry dungeon.If I recall correctly (and I could be wrong), the Might and Magic games used every square, so if you found yourself walling off an area, it was a sure sign of a secret door. Wizardry doesn't seem to use every square, although walled-off areas are sometimes signs of secret doors (I didn't have any on this level). If you have a walled-off area, you have to test it by (k)icking at every wall square around its perimeter (something I have fun picturing my characters doing). If, having done so, you can't find a way in, it's a good sign that those squares aren't used. I color them in at that point. But there's always a chance that some alternate staircase or teleporter will toss you into that area (perhaps with a one-way secret door for an exit).The maps in Wizardry also have another odd characteristic: they double back on themselves. If you look at the one above, space 0,10 is theoretically at the westernmost extent of the map. But there's an opening to the west. Take it, and you find yourself at square 19,10. Without the DUMAPIC spell, this would all be a little tough to figure out.I suspect I'm going to run out of things to say about the game long before I win it, but I don't want to wait too long between postings. So here's a discussion topic for the next post: coming up with character names. How do you do it? Probably some of you can figure out where the names of my party at the top of this post came from, but this isn't my usual modus operandi.Later edit: I was getting cocky, apparently. Level 3, in addition to featuring numerous pit traps, plays host to legions of ninjas who can decapitate your characters with a single blow. I've run out of money to use for resurrection, and it will take hours of killing low-level monsters to build up my finances again. I'm going to sleep on it, but Telengard (the next game on my list) is starting to look really good right now."}, {"title": "Wizardry: Dead Means Dead", "date": "Wednesday, February 24, 2010", "text": "In my introductory post, speaking about the difficulties of balancing CRPGs with my busy schedule, I wrote, \"If my problem was that CRPGs were competing with my to do list, they would become part of my to do list.\" My success in this area was made manifest over the last few days. Traveling on both pleasure and business, I didn't have any time to play, let alone blog, and (absurdly) I started to worry about how far behnd in CRPG playing I was falling. I'm back, thankfully, and continuing to try my hand at Wizardry.Through some experimentation, I figured out how the game's \"save\" works. Basically, every time you end your session and leave the game, it saves whatever has happened to your party through that point, including if your entire party is dead. You cannot choose when to save and, therefore, when to reload, so death is more-or-less permanent (more on that in a sec). The really odd thing: Wizardry saves the game even if I force DOSBox to quit instead of leaving through the normal method. How does it do this? Isn't forcing DOSBox to quit essentially like killing the power?Whatever the mechanism, the only way to preserve your save game, apparently, is to make a copy of the save file before you go adventuring. That way you can restore it if things go ill. That would be cheating, though, and cheating is against my rules.But here's the thing that makes Wizardry unique among role-playing games: when your characters die, their bodies remain in the dungeon, and another party can \"find\" them! I discovered this quite by accident when my third party wandered into the room where the second party had been killed, chose to (I)nspect (I thought it was for secret doors) and found their brutalized corpses.\"Let's just check over here and see if there's any treas--....oh, yuck.\"Apparently, I can recover these dead characters, get their equipment, and take their bodies up to the temple for resurrection. Unfortunately, this only helps to the extent that your new characters can survive long enough to reach the dead ones. And by that time they're probably about the same level as the dead ones, so you don't need the dead ones anymore anyway.Still, a strategy becomes clear. I must create double the number of characters as the party will accommodate (6). Every time I leave the dungeon, I'll rotate a few out and a few more in, keeping their experience levels as equal as possible. That way, if one party is slaughtered, the other can go rescue them. Unlike Rogue, I won't need to keep starting over at level 1.I thought you might be curious what the gameplay looks like, so I took a movie of about 4.5 minutes. When you see the cursor moving around, I'm not actually clicking on anything, of course--the game is all keyboard-driven. I'm just trying to give you a sense of what options I'm choosing.I'll keep playing away at Wizardry and let you know what other cool things I find."}, {"title": "Wizardry: This Is Going to Take a While", "date": "Saturday, February 20, 2010", "text": "Yeah, so Wizardry is a bit of a bitch. Here's what I've discovered bumbling my way through the first level:There's no real way to save the game. When you come out of the dungeon and return to the town, your characters are saved, but the dungeon itself is reset. There is no way to save your progress while in the dungeon. And here's the kicker: if your characters die, they die permanently. You cannot quit the game and reload to save them.When you encounter monsters, only your front three characters can directly engage them. The back characters can use spells, but they only get a couple of spells each at the first level, and these run out quickly. There doesn't seem to be any missile weapons in the game.Practically every chest is trapped, usually with a poison needle, and half the time my thief trips it and gets poisoned.The magic system is interesting. To cast a spell, you must type its name. Luckily I found some spell cards online.When you engage in combat, you tell the game what you want each of your characters to do in the next round, such as (f)ight, (p)arry, or cast a (s)pell. You then execute these actions all at once.There are fixed encounters at certain points on the map. Sometimes these encounters turn out to be with \"friendly\" monsters, but otherwise there is no way to avoid them.\u00a0 I must admit, though, I'm a sucker for games that allow me to map on graph paper. I just enjoy making these maps and annotating what I find in each square. Lacking any graph paper, and not really wanting to carry it around with me, I hit upon the solution of using Excel to create the maps. I'm making each worksheet a level, and using the border options to draw the walls and doors.Modern-day graph paperYou can see I didn't get very far. First trip out, I mapped the bottom corridor and killed some kobolds. So far, so good. I went back up to the surface to save and identify a piece of armor at the store. Second trip, I went back to the same place, got ambushed by two groups of \"small humanoids,\" and all of my characters were slaughtered.Party 1 about to enjoy its first--and only--successful battleI generated a second party and had a little more luck, winning about six battles.\u00a0 But none of my characters had even leveled before the inevitable happened:\u00a0 Damn.

First released in 1981, Wizardry would seem to be the precursor to all first-person multi-character games, like Bard's Tale and Might and Magic. I couldn't find an original manual for Wizardry, but this site gives a basic breakdown of the plot: Lord Trebor, the \"mad overlord\" of the title, has become obsessed with a powerful amulet that he briefly possessed, only to have it stolen by the evil wizard Werdna (one guess where those names came from). Werdna has fled to the depths of the dungeons beneath Trebor's castle. Trebor's heroes have managed to secure the first four levels of the dungeons but no one can survive below that; the first four levels, seeded with monsters and laced with traps, are the \"proving grounds\" of the title: a place where would-be heroes can demonstrate their worth to venture deeper into the dungeon and recover the amulet.I spent a little time tonight making a party of six characters:Yes, I know I could stand to be a little more clever with character names.But this is as far as I got before sleep beckoned. When I return to the game, I may keep these characters or start over. I'm not sure I did it right.Thanks to everyone who has followed my new blog during its first week. I will probably not post for a few days, as over the weekend I will be playing games of a different sort: I am going to the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in New York City.

[Ed. It is no longer online, nor could I find it in an archive. Alas.] I was curious what others had to say about the disappearance of dwarves, elves, and hobbits from Sosaria/Britannia after Ultima I (or after Ultimas I-III, it turns out), and also the absurdities involved with starting in a medieval world as an elf wizard and ultimately journeying into space.15 years old now, this FAQ was written by an Ultima apologist who tried to find logical consistency in the elements of the first few Ultimas. He or she tries to answer why the non-human player races disappeared (a combination of continental destruction and self-isolation), why space shuttles and air cars show up in Ultima I (Mondain, intent on world domination, altered dimensional doors to travel to the future and bring back technology), and why Ultima II takes place on Earth--but ah, we haven't gotten to Ultima II yet. Fun stuff, and I'm sure I'll refer to it again.Anyway, I won a lot more quickly than I expected after my last post.  First, I kept visiting the Pillar of the Argonauts and got, in succession, a triangle (no idea, but it did some serious damage to a few pirate ships), a pistol, a \"light sword,\" a phazor, and a blaster. The last two turned out to do more damage than the lasers on my air car, but I have to confess I kept myself primarily armed (until the end) with my light sword, enjoying the thought of going all Luke Skywalker on orcs and evil rangers.I next spelunked some dungeons and finished the quests that each of the kings gave me. For each king that wanted me to kill a monster, when I returned to him I found out something more about the main quest:Rondarin: \"The time machine must be used in order to win.\"Lost King: \"It requires four gems to launch the time machine\" (each king gave me a gem, too).Black Dragon: \"The princess will help a Space Ace through time.\"Shamino: mutely gives me a white gem.I also discovered a White Dragon castle, which I'm again pretty sure (I'll bet you're sick of me saying this) returns in Ultima VII.Becoming a Space Ace involved purchasing a space shuttle from Britain, launching it, docking with the International Space Station, and paying 500 coins to rent an X-wing with lasers. You think I'm kidding, but there it is on the bottom.Alas, on my first trip, my elf wizard forgot some of the more elementary principles of astrophysics:My second time, I remembered to purchase and wear a vacuum suit, but then I accidentally flew into the sun. My third trip, I didn't bring enough gold for more than one ship rental, which turned out to be too little. Success followed my fourth trip.To become a \"Space Ace,\" I had to shoot down 20 tie fighters. When I mentioned tie fighters in yesterday's posting, you probably thought I was kidding. Hell, I thought I was kidding. But there it is.Killing them with cursor controls turned out to be a bit of a pain, but ultimately I got through it and returned to Sosaria. Of this space silliness, the manual says, \"'Tis said that the Evil One [Mondain] has formed alliances with starwalking monsters of unparalleled savagery. These malicious creatures stand poised to swoop down upon our people and devastate them.\" With light swords, tie fighters, and X-wings, does anyone else want to venture the opinion that Mondain is a Sith lord? It really makes perfect sense. He even has an evil apprentice. And in Ultima VI it turns out that the gargoyles worship him; their three principles of virtue are control, diligence, and passion--which sounds an awful lot like the Code of the Sith presented in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Anyone with me?Anyway, here's where the game gets ugly. The Black Dragon king said the princess would help me through time. The princess is locked in Lord British's castle (actually, every castle, but LB's is the one I went to). The jester--who, it also turns out, has been stealing my equipment--keeps yelling \"I have the key!\" Hence, I need to get the key from the jester. I can't talk to him, and (s)teal doesn't work. The only way I could determine to get it was to kill him.This is going to hurt you more than it hurts me.As you can see, I gunned him down right in front of Lord British. This caused the royal guards to attack me, and I had to massacre them, too.  But in the end I unlocked the princess's cell and led her to safety. \u00a0\u00a0This is great and all, but do you think maybe Lord British could have just given me the princess? I mean, I'm there at his behest to save the world and all.  And the worst part is the jester was named \"Gwino.\" It's a slightly different spelling, but I'm pretty sure I blasted Iolo's wife. Presumably, Lord British resurrected her after I left.After I got the princess to safety, she told me...well, I don't know. The screen only stayed up for a fraction of a second. I must have the frame rate set too high in DOSBox. Long story short, I had to repeat this gruesome process three times before I finally figured out she was telling me the time machine was to the northwest. As you'll soon see, I now had three time machines.The end of the game was remarkably simple: enter the time machine, blast Mondain until he turns into a bat (yeah, the Sith Lord theory breaks down there), (g)et his gem to destroy it, and keep firing away until Mondain was dead. But don't rely on my banal description: you can watch it! I downloaded some video recording software so I can record the ends (and other notable moments) of all the CRPGs I win.Lord British's accolades ring a bit hollow since he did absolutely zip to help me kill Mondain. All he did was send me off to a graveyard and give me some strength and watch passively while I mass-murdered his castle. It was all the other kings who gave me the tips I needed to win. Here's hoping you develop some virtues as you get older, young LB.Verdict: Should you play Ultima I? Absolutely, without question, if you intend to play any of the later Ultima games. It introduces you to the lore of the land and the basic mythology of what will become Britannia. The dungeon crawls are fun and the space stuff is silly but inoffensive. Finally, as you've seen, it takes a mere few hours to win.Next up: Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord.*****Further reading: The story continues with Ultima II (1982), Ultima III (1983), Ultima IV (1985), Ultima V (1988), Ultima VI (1990), Ultima VII (1992), Ultima Underworld (1992), and somewhere in there we have the dreadful Ultima: Escape from Mount Drash (1983). For a British copy of the original Ultima, see The Ring of Darkness (1982)."}, {"title": "Ultima: Hit Points and Progress", "date": "Wednesday, February 17, 2010", "text": "There aren't many common elements that you find in every RPG, but hit points (or \"life points,\" or \"vitality,\" or whatever you call them) may be one of them (if there are any exceptions, let me know). You even find them in non-RPG first-person shooters, although you usually see something like a \"health bar\" instead of an actual number. This seems obvious to any modern gamer, but remember that to those of us who grew up with parlor video games, and then early console games, the basic unit of health was the \"life.\" In Galaga, or Space Invaders, or Pac-Man, you got three \"lives\"--and every time the enemy scored a hit, you didn't just lose some portion of your health. You died. Die three times and game over.Even the earliest CRPG-ish games were \"life\" focused. Ghosts 'n Goblins is a good example. (I'd have a mansion in Santa Barbara now if I had just invested the quarters I spent on that game as a kid.) You started the game with three lives, and each life started with a suit of armor. Get hit once, you lose your armor. Get hit a second time, you were dead. You basically had two hit points.Real \"hit points\" came from pen-and-paper RPGs, of course. Hit points are the glue that holds all RPGs together. They turn action games into strategic games, allowing you to experiment and take risks. And within the game, they are the end-all be-all. When you think about it, almost everything else you acquire or do ultimately boils down to hit points. You buy the best armor to preserve your hit points as long as possible. You seek the best weapons and spells so you can reduce the enemies' hit points before they reduce yours. You quest for rings that protect you from fire, frost, paralysis, and poison--all to minimize your loss of hit points. You level up to increase your maximum hit points. In almost any RPG, if you didn't have to worry about hit points, there wouldn't be any reason not to stroll through the game with cloth armor and a dagger. If anyone ever makes a movie about CRPGs, they ought to call it Hit Points.Last night I defended Ultima I's practice of awarding hit points, upon exiting a dungeon, for all the monsters you killed while in the dungeon. I rationalized that it \"cuts out the middle man\" of experience and levels, which hit points are based on. But I realized a flaw in my logic: experience and levels in other games change your maximum hit points, not the number you currently have. The latter is just absurd. And there are no healing spells or potions in Ultima I, making it the only game I know in which when you're low on hit points, you'd better head straight for the nearest dungeon and find some monsters to fight!Grey Star emerges from a session of dungeon crawling...healthier.As I write tonight's blog entry, I have 2,556 hit points, up from the 100 I started the game with. Based on the counter, which only has four digits, I'm guessing you can get a maximum of 9,999 hit points. That's some serious health. And you can just buy them! When I was a kid, we had to earn our hit points. Oh...wait. Right.Anyway, my plan last night was to buy a frigate, but when I got to Scooter's Super Duper Transport, Inc. in Brtiain I discovered they had both aircars and shuttles available. I had forgotten--probably \"blocked\"--the space-based element of Ultima I. It comes at you with no warning, really. One moment you're fighting orcs with a sword, and the next you're floating about in an air car, shooting your enemies with lasers. People who have never played Ultima I are assuming I'm drunk, but I swear I'm not making this up. After a few hours of play, I lost any need to attack outdoor enemies with regular weapons.Eat pulses of electromagnetic radiation, thou knave!So basically I've been flying around and exploring the map. The map--like all Ultimas until Ultima VI--is based on discrete tiles. There are about 250 north-south and 300 east-west, for a total of 75,000 in the game. Bigger than I remembered. Too many to map. I feel like I should also mention for those readers who have never played old CRPGs that all the moves are turn-based. If you just sit in place, the rest of the game world does not continue on around you.The game consists of four main continents: the Lands of Lord British, the Lands of the Dark Unknown, the Lands of Danger and Despair, and the Lands of the Feudal Lords. Each land has at least one castle with a king who gives you a quest. I completed my quest for Lord British--to find the Grave of the Lost Soul--quite easily. He gave me +10 strength and sent me out again...to find the Grave of the Lost Soul. So much for finding answers. I'm still not clear how to progress in the main quest to kill Mondain, but perhaps once I finish all the various lords' quests once, I'll get some kind of hint. I remember that eventually I'm going to have to buy a space shuttle and head off to shoot some relfighters (again, not making this up).Some other things:I bought a wand but I can't figure out for the life of me how to use it. I can (r)eady it, but neither (a)ttack or (f)ire seems to work with it. In fact, the game asks me incredulously, \"Attack with wand?!\" like I'm some kind of idiot.Screw you, Ultima. What else am I going to do with it?Even squids and sea monsters give you money. I don't know if they carry it around or if the game is assuming I sell their ink and hides.You cannot board pirate ships. That must be in a later Ultima. If you try, they just barrage you with cannons until you die.In addition to air cars and space shuttles, you can buy vacuum suits and reflect suits. Just right over the counter.If you try to (s)teal from the storerooms of a town or castle, you are swarmed by guards who pummel you to death.I know I mentioned this yesterday, but I'm still tickled that Ultima VII's Montor and Fawn show up here in Ultima I. So does Paws from Ultima IV, and there's a city called Moon that I think appears in Ultima III. There are lots of other cities, people, and locations that I don't remember ever appearing again: the City of Wealth, the City of Poor, the City of Imagination, the Pillar of Ozymandais, the City of Snake, the Lost King, the Black Dragon (a king), the Castle of Olympus. But it's been years since I played an Ultima game, so maybe I'm wrong.Shamino is here! And he's a king! (He wants me to kill a balron.) And suddenly yet another subplot of Ultima VII makes a lot more sense.There are a bunch of signposts on small islands that give you bumps in stats when you (e)nter them (took me a while to figure that out). There's also one that gives you a weapon every time you visit. I think it gives the next best weapon that you don't have. So if you don't have a dagger, it gives you a dagger. If you have a dagger, it gives you an axe. It takes a while to reset. I kept leaving and coming back before I realized I could probably just buy all the lower weapons and see what it gives me at the high end. I did that, made my way back to the post, and it gave me...a dagger. Dammit! Turns out when thieves attack you, they steal all of the non-readied armor and weapons you have. I have to go buy them all again and try again (this time without popping in to a dungeon first).I'm well past six hours, but I like the game too much to stop, and anyway, it's the first game in the Ultima series. I have to finish this one.Can anyone else remember any references from an early game in an CRPG series to show up years later?"}, {"title": "Game 4: Ultima (1981)", "date": "Tuesday, February 16, 2010", "text": "UltimaUnited StatesIndependently developed; California Pacific Computing (publisher)Released in 1981 for Apple II and Atari 800Remade and re-released as Ultima I in 1986 for Apple II; 1987 for Commodore 64 and DOS; 1988 for PC-88, PC-98, and Sharp X1; 1989 for MSX; 1994 for Apple IIGSDate Started: 16 February 2010\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My little project encompasses...I don't know...probably more than 500 games. I haven't counted them yet; I don't want to discourage myself. But considering the sheer number of games on the list, I was surprised how quickly I found myself playing a game I had already played. I assumed I would have to slog through dozens of unfamiliar titles before I got to something I remembered. But here I am, starting one of the best CRPG series of all time, replaying Ultima for the first time in over 10 years.The original Ultima came out in 1981. I'm playing the 1986 re-release for DOS, downloaded (along with a suspiciously contemporary manual) from some abandonware site.  From what I understand, the gameplay is the same, but the graphics were notably improved.The manual follows the usual practice of explaining the somewhat limited game world in vivid and florid prose. Of orcs, it says: \"Tribal by nature, they are sub-human at best, just a slight cut above true bestiality. They abhor all things human and cultured and will lay waste to anything fashioned by human hands. 'Tis said that they relish the taste of human flesh.\" In the real game, of course, orcs are little icons against which you hit (A)ttack over and over until they are dead, with no other interaction or depth. This isn't to say the manual isn't fun. If you're of a mind, whenever an orc approaches you can make up a little conversation to have with it. (It will end with the orc sniffing and shouting, \"manflesh!\", naturally.)This one page has more text than the entire on-screen game. I'm not complaining; just saying.I'm surprised at how many oddities I didn't remember. The character creation process allows you to choose from among elf, hobbit, and dwarf races in addition to humans--anyone remember any of these races in later Ultimas? I don't often play nonhuman spellcasting classes in single-player CRPGs, so I thought I'd go against type on this one. Oddly, it later appears my wizard character can still use any weapons and armor. I'm not sure what the downsides are to being a wizard.The top-down game perspective starts you off in the middle of a plain  on the continent of Sosaria, knowing only that your ultimate goal is to defeat the scourge of Sosaria: Mondain, an evil wizard who has unleashed unnatural monsters on the land. A few steps away are Lord British's castle and, right next to it...the City of Britain?! Really?! Was this something changed in the remake to make it more like Ultima IV-VII, or were these two locations always side-by-side? In any event, it's time to role play. You're a new adventurer seeking to rid Sosaria of an evil tyrant. First thing to do is to have a chat with the young benevolent sovereign that the manual has gone on about: Lord British. I wandered into his castle hoping to gain some insight into my quest, but I was immediately and tersely told by His Highness to go find the Grave of the Lost Soul and not return until I had. I guess a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.Lord British's castle and the City of Britain. Alas, no one's telling me anything about mantras and runes yet.The interaction is pretty basic keyboard-only stuff. I failed to remember that you cannot talk to any characters except the king and some merchants. But even here there are fun little touches. Iolo the Bard, your stalwart companion from Ultima IV onward, shows up in every town singing \"ho eyoh he hum\" (it's an anagram; get it?) in the background. Here's the city of Paws, which I remember located south of Lord British's castle in Ultima IV, and here's Yew, the future home of the druids. And why does the City of Fawn sound a forgotten echo in my brain? Do we encounter that again in Ultima VII? (Edit: we do! And Montor, too! Now I know where those cities come from. I just got a little tingle.) (But I have to force myself not to mess around on that Ultima wiki; too many spoilers.) The shops, although they all sell essentially the same things at the same prices, distinguish themselves with colorful names: Li'L Karelia's Finnish Grocery, Cold Steel Creations, Fastest Freshest Food Market, Mystic Melinda's.In the castle of the Lost King.Almost immediately you begin starving. Why are all these early CRPGs so obssessed with food? Every two steps consumes a meal, so at the beginning, almost all the gold you have goes into food. Only when you have more than 1000 meals on hand do you start to feel comfortable buying better weapons, armor, and (in my case) spells. Fortunately, if you buy some method of transport like a horse, it cuts down on your food use.I don't want to spoil how this battle turned out, but...Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!Hit points are awarded the same way they were in Akalabeth: you descend into a dungeon, slay some monsters, and return to the surface. It seems a silly way to do it, but keep in mind that there are no experience points or levels in these early CRPGs. Hit points are your only measure of advancement. Since in later CRPGs, hit points are dependent upon your level, which is dependent upon your experience, which is dependent upon slaying monsters, this method actually makes sense--it just cuts out the middle man. You can also get hit points by bribing Lord British for them. In just the last post, I was lamenting how most games don't give you much to do with all the money you make. Already I find one that proves me wrong. Also, as a mage, I need to keep buying spells if I want to use them. You can never have too many \"kill\" spells!Like Akalabeth, dungeons are first-person. Like the towns and shops, they have creative and forboding names: the Dungeon of Perinia, the Mines of Mt. Drash, the Unholy Hole. Monsters are more randomized than in Akalabeth, and there are fun add-ins like coffins, chests (which are usually trapped), and magic barriers. Monsters regenerate on levels so you're never truly safe--you never know when one is going to sneak up behind you and start walloping you. Stray too far in a dungeon and you won't be able to get out in time (although the mage spell \"ladder up\" seems to help a lot).Rats again. Every game has rats.I explored a bit, made a few forays into dungeons, died a couple of times and was resurrected with only 99 hit points and food, and got an additional quest from someone called \"The Lost King\" (does he ever show up again in a later Ultima?) to kill a gelatinous cube. In both castles I've visted, a mysterious princess is being held captive in a guarded prison, and I remember vaguely that I have to do something with her later, but I forget what. In any event, it's clear that the Grave of the Lost Soul isn't on this island, so I have a plan: screw around in the dungeons until I have at least 1000 hit points and 2000 gold; spend the latter on food and a frigate, and set out to explore the rest of this world. Already I'm having more fun than in Akalabeth, Rogue, and Temple of Apshai combined.*****Further reading: The story continues with Ultima II (1982), Ultima III (1983), Ultima IV (1985), Ultima V (1988), Ultima VI (1990), Ultima VII, Ultima Underworld, and somewhere in there we have the dreadful Ultima: Escape from Mount Drash (1983).

When you first start, you can generate a character randomly or \"enter thine own character.\" The manual helpfully explains that you might want to import a character from some other adventure. I don't know whether the creators really thought legions of pen-and-paper RPG players would import their characters to Temple of Apshai or whether they were just providing some easy way to cheat, but choosing this option allows you to give yourself the highest statistics, all the equipment, and as much money and experience as you want.Generally, I don't regard it as \"cheating\" if you use features the game provides to you, but in this case to get the full challenge of the game, I chose a random character. Out of 18 maximum, I got 8 for intelligence and intuition, 13 for ego, 14 for strength, 11 for constitution, 12 for dexterity, and 43 silver pieces. Sounds like I'm a fighter, maybe a barbarian. I chose the name \"Gnarge\" 'cause it sounds like something a barbarian would say. The game has you purchase your equipment from an innkeeper via an all-text interface, and in short order you're in one of three temples, each with four levels.Gnarge the Barbarian prepares to sally forth.Almost immediately, I discovered something unique about Temple of Apshai. Each of the rooms and corridors, all numbered, have corresponding textual descriptions in the game manual. For instance, you start off in Room #1, of which the manual says: \"The smooth stonework of the passageway floor shows that advanced methods were used in its creation. A skeleton sprawls on the floor just inside the door, a bony hand still clutching a rusty dagger, outstretched toward the door to safety. A faint roaring sound can be heard from the far end of the passage.\" Other descriptions even reference items that you find in the rooms and hint at the presence of certain monsters, treasures, or secret doors. For instance, a warning about a hole in the floor and \"a very long drop\" prompted me to search for, and find, a trap, and a note that \"the west wall of the cavern shows the marks of carving tools\" clued me in to the presence of a secret door. It's vaguely fun trying to figure out whether \"the air smells of decaying vegetable matter\" indicates something important or not.The treasures have descriptions, too. \"A beautiful cloak, wondrously light, yet tough as nails,\" the manual says of an early find. (Too bad I can't wear it.) The effect is to make Temple of Apshai like a graphics-enabled version of pen-and-paper RPGs. In some ways, it reminds me of the adventurers' journals that accompanied the \"Gold Box\" D&D games, which I still remember fondly. The rooms in TOA change quickly, though, and it's tough to keep up with all of them.The gameplay essentially consists of wandering through the passages, fighting monsters, and gathering treasure from chests. When you leave the temple and return to the inn, the innkeeper automatically converts your treasure to silver, which you can then use to purchase better equipment or more healing salves. I've been playing for a few hours, and I think that's all there is to it. As you fight monsters (mostly mosquitos and rats on Level 1) and get hit, your health slowly decreases from 100%. Healing salves only bump it up by a few percentages, so eventually you have to make your way back to the entrance and return to the inn to rest and save. When you do, the dungeon completely resets. According to the manual, the innkeeper is supposed to be assigning me experience for the monsters I've slain in each sortie, but no matter how long I spend in the dungeon or how many monsters I kill, my experience points remain fixed at 0.Gnarge fights the scourge of all first-level adventurers.After but a few hours of game play, I have more silver than I need to buy all of the items the innkeeper sells. I don't know yet whether there are any other places to buy items in the game, but I suspect not. Having too much money is one of the things I can't stand about most CRPGs. There should always be something new to buy, some way to spend your money. But almost every CRPG I know reaches a point--often fairly early--in which it no longer makes any sense to accumulate wealth. The only exceptions I know off the top of my head are the Hordes of the Underdark expansion to Neverwinter Nights, in which you can keep upgrading your weapons with more money, and Might and Magic VI, in which you can convert your money to experience via a magic well.Other oddities to Temple of Apshai: I bought a bow and arrows but I can't seem to hit anything no matter how many arrows I shoot (which is too bad because monsters don't seem to advance while you're shooting at them). Even with melee weapons, I seem to get into positions in which all of my strikes, even against the basest of monsters, miss. You can talk to monsters, even ones like bats and rats that shouldn't logically be able to speak. They generally say \"ye may pass\" but then attack you anyway. I've noticed that the rooms go in rough order, so if you suddenly skip from Room 3 to Room 9, that's a good sign there was a secret door back in Room 3 leading to Rooms 4-8. The game seems to often think I've pressed the \"H\" key even when I haven't, forcing me to use up a healing salve.Our intrepid adventurer is about to be slain by Pedobear.Already I'm suspecting that there is no way to \"win\" Temple of Apshai. The manual doesn't give any suggestion that there is an ultimate goal except to continue to gain experience (which I can't seem to do) and, I guess, explore every crevice of the three dungeons. My rules say I have to devote a minimum of six hours to a game, so I'll keep playing until I get sick of it or discover hidden depths. If there's any of the latter, I'll write a second posting on Apshai. Otherwise, it's on to the original Ultima.**Someone who responded to my original posting on Reddit suggested I would really enjoy Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. Alas, there doesn't seem to have been a DOS port for that game.*****Further reading: An expanded post on Temple of Apshai (1979) and two spin-offs, Datestones of Ryn and Morloc's Tower where you can see the original version, not the DOS repackaging that we have here. The Dunjonquest line continues with Hellfire Warrior (1980), StarQuest: Rescue at Rigel (1980), StarQuest: Star Warrior (1980), Sorcerer of Siva (1981), The Keys of Acheron (1981), Danger in Drindisti (1982), and Gateway to Apshai. Relative to my last line above, I did eventually play Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves (1981).Rogue: The Adventure GameUnited States Independently developed; this version published by EpyxReleased 1980 for mainframes; in the subsequent 20 years ported to nearly every platformDate Started: 15 October 2009Date Ended: 14 February 2010Total Hours: 90Difficulty: Hard-Very Hard (4.5/5)Final Rating: 24Ranking at Game #403: 175/403 (43%)\u00a0There are many versions of Rogue floating about. The original was published in 1980; the one I ended up playing was a 1985 DOS-based re-release (I'm playing in order of original release, not in order of the particular edition I find). The instruction manual sets up the story: you are a rogue, plunging in to the Dungeon of Doom to retrieve the Amulet of Yendor, stolen in some distant time past from surface folk by the Dungeon Lord. I admit to a certain weakness for little stories like this at the beginning of instruction manuals. Always, in the beginning days of CRPGs, the written story in the manual promised drama, variety, and actual role-playing that the gameplay didn't really deliver.There is no character creation per se. You give your rogue a name, and you find yourself in a randomly-generated Level 1 of the Dungeon of Doom, with the same statistics and equipment every time.Entering the appropriately-named Dungeons of Doom.The game has a top-down perspective. Your character is represented by a little smiley face, treasures and items by various characters, and monsters by capital letters corresponding to their names--\"V\" for vampire, \"H\" for hobgoblin, and so on. There are some weird ones: what are (K)estrels and (E)mus doing in a dungeon, and why are they attacking me? There are also a few found, as far as I can tell, only in Rogue, like (A)quators (those armor-destroying sons of bitches) and (U)r-viles.You interact with the world through simple keyboard commands: \"t\" to throw a weapon, \"w\" to wield a weapon, but \"W\" to wear armor, and so on. The goal is to navigate your way around, finding treasure (and especially food) until you find the stairs to the next level of the dungeon. As you descend, the monsters get progressively harder--while, oddly, the treasures don't seem to get much better; you can just as easily find a suit of plate mail on Level 1 as you can on Level 25. (This, incidentally, turns out to be the only real way to win the game.)The simplicity of the commands and the turn-based nature of Rogue are what I think make it so addictive. It's a game that you can easily play for 10 or 15 minutes at a time while waiting for some code to compile or someone to show up for a meeting. There's even a \"supervisor\" key that changes the screen to what looks like a DOS prompt (although having a DOS window open at all would be suspicious nowadays!). The game isn't even designed as if you're expected to win. Instead, the purpose seems to be to get the highest score possible when you either win or die. The game records your score (defined by your level and gold pieces) every time you sleep the Big Sleep. One can easily envision a time when there were thousands of Rogue players each boasting their new high score.I wanted to win, though, and so every time I bit the dust, I howled my frustration to the walls of my study and started over again at Level 1. I lost track of how many characters--many of them maddeningly close to the Amulet of Yendor--died on me, but it must have been 50 at least.Gold, which in early games I was delighted to see accumulating so quickly, has no value except for points. Well into my first week of Rogue, I kept thinking I'd find a merchant somewhere who would sell me better equipment or identify my items. No such luck. What you find is dependent upon what the map randomly generates. Sometimes you might find a two-handed sword +1 on the first level; other times, you'll find three poison potions and a cursed dagger.Our hero takes a chance on an unidentified wand and ends up polymorphing a bat into one of the most difficult monsters in the game. Time to try again...The luck of the draw turned out to be my salvation. On my umpteenth try, my character found both a ring and an ID scroll on Level 1. The ring turned out to be a Ring of Slow Digestion, which greatly decreased the need for constant food. With this need out of the way, I could linger on levels, slay more easy monsters, and increase my level (and hit points) faster. I could also afford to take the time to search for traps and secret doors where before my life had been a constant race to find the next bit of food. I was also extremely lucky on the next few levels finding Potions of Gain Strength, Scrolls of Increase Armor, and Scrolls of Increase Weapon which significantly boosted my stats. I learned to take off my armor at the first sight of an aquator, lest it destroy it, and I learned to throw anything I had (the game lets you throw swords and maces along with arrows and daggers) at rattlesnakes before they could bite me. But the Ring of Slow Digestion was the real winner: if I knew four months ago what I knew now, I would have kept replaying Level 1 until I found one.Once I found the Amulet of Yendor (on level 29), the game was embarrassingly easy. Once you find the amulet, you have to head back up the stairs on each level to get back to Level 1. Instead of exploring levels, you can just head up the moment you find the nearest stairs (and I had saved several Scrolls of Mapping just for that purpose). I figured the monsters would continue to be difficult all the way to the exit. But they actually decrease in difficulty as you ascend. In short order, I was in the teens and there was no real threat to me. By the time I actually got to Level 1 and there was only a snake standing between the exit and my 16th-level rogue with +4 plate mail and a +5 two-handed sword, I actually felt sorry for the poor bastard.Never stand between a rogue with the Amulet of Yendor and the exitThe end game, I must admit, was a bit disappointing after four months of play. Would some kind of CGI cut-scene voiced by Ian McKellen have been so hard?Insult to injury: my rogue is admitted to the fighter's guildThe good news: I've been exposed to a whole new type of CRPG. And no Bioware or SSI game--not even the dreadful Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor will ever seem long or repetitive again. On now to the Temple of Apshai Trilogy.****Further reading: My experience with roguelikes grows with postings on Moria, Omega, Hack, early NetHack, and NetHack 3.0."}, {"title": "Rogue: the most difficult CRPG I've played", "date": "Monday, February 15, 2010", "text": "The original version had even more primitive ASCII graphics.

Rogue was originally written by Michael Toy and fellow students at UC Santa Cruz, primarily for other students. Toy was kicked out of school for poor academic performance, but he got a job at UC Berkeley and finished development there. A few years later, Toy tried to commercialize the game by publishing a version for DOS, Macintosh, and other systems through Epyx--the version that I played. The code proved easy to copy, however, and the future of what became the \"roguelike\" subgenre was destined to be open-source and freely distributed. Rogue's direct descendants were Hack (1984) and NetHack (earliest version in 1988).]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rogue was the second game I played as part of this little project, and it nearly ended the project.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Computer games can up the difficulty--and, hence, much of the excitement--based on how often they allow you to save the game. If I recall correctly, the first few editions of Might and Magic only allow you to save at inns. Every time something good happened to your party out in the world, you'd pray that you could make it back to an inn to save your progress. Ultima IV, at least for the C64, wouldn't let you save inside dungeons. I can't remember how many times I entered the Stygian Abyss only to be killed on the seventh level. Modern CRPGs, I would argue, make it far too easy. Why carefully manage your resources and spells, use a thief to scout ahead, craft a plan of battle if you can just save and reload when the battle goes ill? When playing newer games, I force myself to save only once when I enter a new map and not again until I leave. That way, if my character dies, it actually has consequences.Well. Someone should have told me about Rogue. In all my previous CRPG playing, I had never played it or any of the \"roguelike\" games. Here's the key difference between Rogue and any other game you might play: permanent death. You see, while you can save your game for later play, every time you start up Rogue and choose to continue your progress, the game deletes the save file. If your character dies, he dies permanently. There's no reloading. You can't try to take on that dragon with only a mace \"just to see what happens\" or use an unidentified potion \"just to test it.\" There is no testing, no trial runs, in Rogue.Navigating the corridors of Rogue.Okay, technically speaking, all of this is true only to the extent that you don't cheat and make backups of your save game files. But my rules include no cheating, so  I didn't do that, tempted though I was.Permanent death in some games might be a challenge, but not necessarily an impassable one. In many of them, your character is magically resurrected (albeit with less gold or experience) anyway. You just have to be careful, right? Well, permanent death wouldn't be so bad if Rogue wasn't punishingly difficult in so many other ways. Let's review some of them:All the items you find are unidentified unless you have a scroll of identification or have identified a like item before. Wield an unidentified weapon, read an unidentified scroll, drink an unidentified potion and you may (in fact, usually will) find yourself cursed, paralyzed, or poisoned.Monsters include aquators, which hit by hit rust your armor class down to 0; rattlesnakes, which bite by bite reduce your strength to 0 (unless you find a rare \"restore strength\" potion); wraiths and vampires, which sap all of your hard-earned experience points; venus flytraps, which hold you in place when you desperately, desperately need to flee; nymphs, who steal the magic items you spent hours accumulating; and medusas, which have a reasonably good chance of confusing you the moment you touch them and thus making it impossible to fight them.Almost all of the rooms after Level 3 are darkened, so you never know when you're steps away from a medusa, griffin, or dragon--all of which can kill you nearly instantaneously.Monsters match your pace. You can't even really run away from them. (There are some exceptions but you can't rely on them when permanent death is on the line.)Monsters regenerate constantly. You can't \"clear\" a level. Treasures, on the other hand, do not regenerate. Once you've cleared a level of items, you have to go downwards to find more.Feel like lurking about on the early, easy levels, slaying monsters just to build up experience and hit points? Sorry! You see, your character is slowly starving to death and needs constant input of food which, as in the previous point, does not regenerate. You must keep pressing downward to find food, thus encountering progressively more difficult monsters, whether you're ready or not. Oh, and if you happen to find a cool magic item like a Ring of Regeneration or a Ring of Protection, don't bother putting it on, because it just makes you consume more food!You can't go backwards from difficult levels up to easy ones until you have found the Amulet of Yendor, by which time the need to go backwards has long passed.Traps dog you constantly, some of them tossing you down to the next level before you've finished exploring this one. Sure, you can search for them, but you'd have to search every other square, and thus double the number of movements, and thus increase the speed by which you need your next hard-to-find meal.Ouch. Balancing these difficulties is one \"pro\": your health regenerates fairly quickly. If you can survive one battle, chances are you can heal up before the next one. But, like everything in Rogue, you can't count on this.Our intrepid hero is about to die. Again.The end result is that although the game would probably take only a few hours to complete if you could constantly save and reload, it took me four months to complete playing it \"fair.\" And let's be clear: for three months and 28 days of those four months, I was playing with different characters than the one that ultimately won the game. Most of the time it takes to win Rogue involves playing, dying, screaming, and restarting at Level 1.In the next post, I'll talk about gameplay mechanics and how I finally won.****Further reading: My experience with roguelikes grows with postings on Moria, Omega, Hack, early NetHack, and NetHack 3.0.This main screen is from a later DOS re-make, by which time the game had become known as Ultima 0.\u00a0 [Edit from 2 March 2013: Over three years after I hurriedly wrote about Akalabeth at the beginning of my blogging experience, I revisited the game in much more detail, playing the original Apple II version. I strongly recommend reading the updated posting for a more thorough understanding of the game and its mechanics. Note that in doing so, we more firmly established a 1980 publication date for the game. I also visited some of the PLATO games discussed here in a December 2011 posting on \"The Earliest CRPGs\" and further entries on each of the PLATO games that you can read by following my Index of Games Played by Year. This posting is preserved for historical reasons, but there's really no reason to read it.]Wikipedia's chronology of CRPGs starts in 1974 and 1975 with dnd and Dungeon, two games that never received a DOS port. I would have liked to try them out, and indeed the article notes that dnd \"continues to be played this day on the NovaNET system and Cyber1.\" But frankly, if it's not downloadable and installable on my laptop within a reasonable time frame, it's off the list.The first DOS-based game we come to is Origin's 1979 Akalabeth: World of Doom, also known as Ultima 0, because it features Lord British and several gameplay mechanics that I remember from Ultima I. In this game, we first find the outdoors top-down perspective contrasting with the 3D dungeon-crawl perspective that would remain part of the series, if I recall correctly, all the way through Ultima V (I haven't played any of the Ultimas in about 10 years, so I might be misremembering).I played Akalabeth more than four months ago now (the idea of a blog not having occurred to me back then), and I was surprised by how quick it went. There really isn't much to it; it's more of a demonstration project than a game. After you create your initial character and buy a few supplies (your weapons are limited to a rapier, an axe, a bow, and a magic amulet), you head over to Lord British's castle to get your first monster-killing quest, and then start plumbing the dungeons.Akalabeth shares what I remember as Ultima I's odd trait of awarding hit points based on the time you spend in the dungeon. If you descend with 25 hit points, go down two levels, kill five or six monsters, and head back up to the surface, the game might up you to 30 or 40 hit points. Descend again, try another level, and re-emerge and find yourself with 50. You essentially keep doing this until you have enough to brave the lower reaches and kill the monsters you've been quested to kill. Monsters appear predictably on their levels. Level 1 always has one skeleton and one thief. Level 2 will have a skeleton, a thief, and an orc. Level 3: a skeleton, a thief, and orc, and a snake, and so on down the line. The dungeons are generated every time you start a new game, but within that game, all the dungeons look the same.You gain gold in Akalabeth, but after you make your initial equipment buys, it's really only good for food. In the early stages, starving to death is a real danger, but after you've made a couple of dungeon trips, you have a few thousand meals in your backpack and gold ceases to be very useful. So do weapons, for that matter, once you learn that repeated use of the magic amulet will increase your net statistics to the point that you can kill the toughest creature with one strike from your bare hands.Wikipedia's next titles on the list were two 1979 games in the Dunjonquest series, then Space and Space II, also both 1979. If these were ever available for DOS, I couldn't find them. Temple of Apshai was next but the only version I found was the trilogy released in 1985. Based on my rules, I should have played it next anyway, but I didn't have a clear plan back then so I moved on to Rogue. That's where my blog really begins.Hello, readers! Welcome to my blog, in which I play all computer role-playing games in roughly chronological order from the beginning of time to the modern age. I find that many people who stumble upon my blog start with this entry, since it was the first, so I wanted to give you a bit of an introduction before letting you go ahead and read it, as it was originally published, after the line break below.When I first posted this, I was new to blogging and new to this particular project, and so it took a while for me to find my voice, figure out what I wanted to do, and mature as both a player and blogger. In my opinion, the blog doesn't get good for a while. My early entries are too short, they're poorly-formatted, and in all-too-many cases, I don't know what I'm talking about. As I started, I hadn't discovered excellent online sources like MobyGames yet, I didn't spend enough time talking about developers and companies, I didn't cover the games in enough detail, and I didn't have the same large base of excellent commenters who were helping\u00a0 me find my voice. My point is, if you like the concept of this blog, stick with it and I promise that it improves.Although I intended at the outset to play only DOS or PC games in chronological order, by the end of 2013, I had eliminated this rule, and I started to go back and pick up the games I'd skipped during the first few years. I eventually got through them, but by then new games had surfaced, so I've had to take a third pass through those years. On my \"upcoming\" list, you'll always see a combination of the maximum year I've reached and old games that only recently came to light. It might be a good idea to read my FAQ before you start reading my entries, if you want to better understand my approach and process.As you read the postings on my blog, do be sure to read the comments as well. I get fantastic commenters on this blog. Hardly anyone posts anything trite or juvenile or insulting. We have great discussions that elaborate on the postings, and many of my commenters offer context, clarification, and corroboration of the things I post. Also feel free to comment yourself on old postings. I get a notification on every comment, and I'll usually respond.Thanks for reading this update. Below you'll find the posting I originally offered in February 2010.Best, Chester (\"Chet\") BolingbrokeLast updated 13 June 2021************************************ I don't have time for this.Honestly, in real life, I'm a busy guy. The average visitor to this blog will assume I'm a fat, 20s-something guy who lives with his mom in a dark basement apartment and, if he has a job at all, probably works at a 7-11, making just enough money to buy his geeky computer stuff.It's an unfortunate stereotype that victimizes plenty of young men who are no more absurd in their interests than lummoxes who spend all weekend watching football or bobos who outfit themselves with $1,500 in \"sportswear\" to \"get in touch with nature.\" In my case, in any event, it simply isn't true. I'm in my late 30s. I'm at the top of my field. I make a good living, work about 14 hours per day at several different jobs, and live in a nice house with my wife and pets. I exercise 8-10 hours per week and, for both work and fun, I travel a lot.But I have, always have had, always will have a weakness for computer RPGs. I don't know why. This weakness does not extend to regular RPGs nor to other computer games (I've played my share of first-person shooters and whatnot, and they are occasionally enjoyable, but they don't occupy my attention the way CRPGs do). There is something about the immersiveness of the CRPG story coupled with the active participation and imagination it requires. And I must emphasize \"imagination.\" When I play a CRPG, I visualize the setting. I narrate the scene to myself. I create conversations among my characters. I write parts of the story that don't exist, send my characters off on quests that the game doesn't provide, and otherwise act like a five-year-old playing with his \"Star Wars\" figures.When I said, \"weakness,\" though, I meant it literally, with all of the baggage that comes with it. Ever since I was a kid and got hold of my first RPG--Questron for my Commodore 64--I have indulged my addiction to my detriment. This was quite clear in my junior high and high school report cards, not to mention my social life. I knew every corridor of VARN but was weak in world geography; while other people my age took philosophy courses, I was learning how Ultima IV's Three Principles of Virtue combined to form the Eight Virtues, and while my schoolmates struggled through teen love, first dates, and losing their virginity, I was \"dating\" the clerk of New Phlan.The RPG that hooked me on the genre.Probably all that saved me was how much computers sucked back then. The C64 disk drive alone, which always seemed to be failing, cost more than I made in a month. One day, my computer died, and I simply couldn't afford a new one. Instead, I got some hobbies, got a girlfriend, and went to college, got my first job, and forgot about CRPGs for a while.Then, in the late 1990s, I began to investigate how the field had progressed since I stopped playing a decade earlier. Oh, wow. Why hadn't anyone told me? I updated myself on the Might and Magic series and couldn't believe how good the sixth installment was. Then I discovered Baldur's Gate and its sequel--have two better CRPGs ever been developed? I spent hours exploring the dungeons and towns of Morrowind and was blown away, like everyone else, by Oblivion.But with these new discoveries came the same old problems: tasks undone or done poorly, bleary-eyed confusion two out of three mornings a week at work, disapproving tuts from my wife. Fortunately, by the time I rediscovered CRPGs, I was far enough along in my career, with its attendant obligations, that a sense of professionalism keeps me from sliding completely into chaos and insolvency. At the same time, however, the truth is stark and undeniable: every hour I spend playing a CRPG is an hour that would have been better spent on any one of a hundred other tasks.This came to a head in the fall of 2009. My wife went out of town for a three-day business meeting, and I had planned to use the time to finish editing a book that I'd promised to the publisher a couple of weeks prior. The first morning, I worked maybe an hour on it before deciding to take a break for a \"little\" bit of Oblivion. 72 hours later, when my wife returned, I had done essentially nothing else. I was disgusted with myself. I took the opportunity this feeling provided, grabbed a large trash bag, and before I could stop myself, I stuffed all of my games into it--including almost a dozen that were unopened inside their plastic wrappers. I promised myself I wouldn't waste any more time on such absurdities.This lasted about three weeks, but like all addictions, it proved impossible to fully shake. So I announced to myself a new plan--the epic opposite of what, by throwing away all of my games, I had intended. Instead of dedicating myself to a life of CRPG abstinence, I would instead go the full distance. Assisted by DOSBox, abandonware web sites, and Wikipedia, I would play every CRPG that has ever existed for the PC. If my problem was that CRPGs were competing with my to do list, they would become part of my to do list. Stupid, I know, but that's why I'm here and that's why you're reading.I hadn't intended to make a blog out of this, but it actually makes the project seem more legitimate somehow, more respectable, like the difference between being a movie watcher and a \"film historian.\" Maybe people will read this and re-discover old gems from the past. And, frankly, I think it will be a lot of fun.THE RULESThere must be rules. Otherwise we have chaos. These are my rules as I work my way through every PC CRPG ever published.1. Wikipedia's list is my Bible. The titles on this list are heavily biased towards CRPGs commercially released through established publishers. I understand there are some really good freeware, browser-based, and otherwise noncommercial RPGs out there, but honestly this project is taking enough time as it is. I'm also going to work through the list based on initial publication date, even if the version I'm playing is a re-release or newer port. [Much later edit: This seemed like a good idea when I was just starting, but it soon turned out that Wikipedia's list was not remotely comprehensive. My list ended up being a combination of Wikipedia, MobyGames, and a few other sources.]2. Only PC RPGs. To appear on my play list, the game has to have been released for DOS or the PC, if only as a port. I'm not going to frig around with C64 or Apple II emulators. [Much later edit: This is no longer one of my rules. It was a stupid rule to begin with.]3. No hints, no cheats, no walkthroughs. We didn't have these in the 1980s, and I don't need them now. If I make mistakes, or it takes me a little longer, well that's part of the fun of the game. I will only use the Internet to solve technical problems. I will allow myself one exception: if anyone reading this blog wants to post non-spoiler gameplay hints to problems I've posed, I'll use them.4. I don't have to win every game, but I must at least make a sincere effort to play it. I'm writing this initial posting after already starting on my project. The second game I played (as you'll soon read) was an early version of Rogue. It took me four months of playing to beat it. It became almost an obsession. Four months is an acceptable time to beat some games if the world is big enough (think Morrowind), but the reason it took so long to beat Rogue is that the game is punishingly difficult. After even a few days of playing it, there was really nothing new left to discover. I won't do this for every game. I will devote a minimum of six hours to each one, but if after that I'm having no fun or the play is repetitive, it's on to the next game.4. If the game is still available commercially, I will buy it. I believe in rewarding game developers and publishers for their hard work. But if it is not available commercially, I will have no compunction downloading it from abandonware sites or otherwise obtaining it illegally.With these rules in mind, I embark on adventure!"}]
