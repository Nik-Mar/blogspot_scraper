[{"title": "43 cats to make one bag", "date": "Thursday 17 June 2010", "text": "Thank you for all your comments on the Scrapstore post, some good ideas there. I went again today. It's looking a bit bare now, and thankfully most of it has been passed on to teachers for their crafting classes and to playgroup leaders. I picked out some more fabric offcuts, and other bits and pieces for myself, I also bought a cupboard and an office chair. I have left strict instructions not to dump any fabric, foam, or rolls of window blind fabric, I will collect and store them for future use.Another reason for going was to show them my latest bag made from 35 Felix cat food pouches. It is fully lined and very strong. I am throwing such a lot of these away, and they are so pretty, I was determined to make something from them.First of all I had to think of a way to remove the food without damaging the pouch. The normal way is the tear the top off, but if you look at the bottom it has a gusset, so I took a small sharp craft knife with a pointy blade and carefully sliced through the bottom without damaging the outside. After they were empty I washed them in the washing up bowl after I had done the pots, and left them to dry for a couple of days on the drainer.My first idea was to use all the four colours, but then I thought it would look better using just the red and yellow.I machine stitched it all, and started by sewing four pouches together to make a vertical strip, then joining the strips by sewing the horizontal seams. I held them in place with cellotape at the back while I stitched them because they have to fit together very precisely. The seams are flat with a very narrow overlap.Then I made the two sides using four pouches for each, and joined them to the back and front, with the seams on the outside.The bottom is three pouches, and this is the only place you can see any of the writing. I have overlapped all the others to hide it. The hardest part was sewing the bottom in. I did each seam separately, starting right at the beginning and sewing right to the end. It would have been impossible to sew around the corners, it is far too thick.The top is folded inwards to hide the writing, and the lining is a piece of fabric given to me, the blue matches the pouches exactly.The handles have a vinyl stiffener inside them and are inserted between the outer and the lining. It is finished off with two rows of machine stitching around the top edge.I am very pleased how this has turned out, I think I will make another now with the turquise and pink pouches. They will look lovely on my display at the Arts Centre."}, {"title": "Closing down sale", "date": "Wednesday 16 June 2010", "text": "I've got a bit of sad news today, the scrapstore is closing :0( I had an email last night telling me to get myself over there asap because they are clearing everything out. I was there at just after 10am this morning. I suspected it might come to this, business has been slowing up, there haven't been enough customers through the door for several weeks now.As well as not having enough money to pay the bills, we have also found out that the owners of the building are closing the place down and selling up, so that's a double whammy. There isn't much point in looking for new premises because there isn't enough money in the kitty to pay rent.So it's all gone t1ts up as they say. They have been selling off the stock all week to try and raise enough money to cover the last rent bill. It's such a shame because Lorraine and her husband Bob have been running the place for ages. They have been working voluntarily, five days a week, for a long long time. Phil has also given a lot of his time to it. Other volunteers have come and gone, numbers have dropped, but what can you do, people have other more pressing comitments.The van arrived this morning from Hull Scrapstore, Tracy packed it up to the roof and took it away. She said she might come back for some more. I had a good search round picking out what I wanted, I got a big pile together, mainly fabric, wood, carpet, sticky tape, foam, and other bits and pieces. I made a donation for it even though they said I could have it for the work that I have been doing for them. I was happy with my fantastic bargains. I gave the carpet to Sue to put down in her cat rescue pens.What ever is left on Friday is going to landfill, that will break my heart. I said I will be back on Friday and will take away anything that could be usefull, I can't bear to chuck things into a hole in the ground. I will take what I can, even if it means finding another home for it later on. A very sad day."}, {"title": "Lands End and St Michael's Mount", "date": "Tuesday 15 June 2010", "text": "Another day. Now where was I, oh yes, back at Lands End Youth Hostel, the place that boasts a sea view from almost every room. After checking out it was time to have a look at the last place in England, but I was not going to pay the \u00a33 car parking charge they ask for. Instead I drove to Sennen Cove, the next place along the coast, parked my car free in a layby on the main road, and walked to Lands End.This is Sennen Cove as I approached it from high on the hill top. I walked down to the sea front and followed the path you can see up the hillside into the distance. Leaving the cove, looking back to where I have come from.This is Longships Lighthouse at Lands End, it is 1.25 miles out to sea, and has been unmanned since 1967.Lands End is a bit disappointing, it's like a theme park. The only thing I found of interest was an exhibition telling the history and stories of the land's End to John o Groats challenge, and the different ways people have completed it. This sign is behind a barrier. You can pay the official photographer to put your home town on the sign and have your photo taken standing by it, or you can snap it as it is for free like most people were doing.There is the photographer in his little booth reading his paper, waiting for some paying punters.I spent 75p in the shop and bought myself a souvenir fridge magnet.I wonder if I will ever join the Lands End & John o Groats Club, ha ha.Heading back to Sennen Cove on a slightly different route.My next stop is St Michaels Mount and to see this I must drive past Penzance to Marazion. This is a pretty little town, and I actually found a charity shop there, I bought my friend Sue a pot cat for 75p :-) Here is St Michaels Mount it's an island connected by a causeway, with a castle on it. I was lucky that the tide was out so I was able to walk across. You can have a boat ride when it's high tide.This is the little harbour on the island, no water in it at the moment till the tide comes in.I didn't pay to go into the castle, it's a National Trust property, and I wasn't that bothered about seeing it.This photo is taken from the island looking back at the mainland. More than 30 people live here in the cottages.Workmen are repairing the causeway and are only able to work for short bursts before the tide comes back in. You can see the orange safety netting and the pick up truck parked there.I have a few miles to cover now, I was hoping to visit The Lizard, but time is getting on and I need to check in at the next hostel at Boswinger, not far from Gorran Haven, so I must push on. Driving past Helston and Truro, passing such a lot of interesting places, but no time to stop. I shall have to come back another time."}, {"title": "Looking after their customers!", "date": "Monday 14 June 2010", "text": "How very enterprising of our Ambulance Service. To drum up some more custumers they are having a summer sale. I wonder what offers they have, I must pop in and ask next time I am passing, I might be tempted to bag a bargain.Maybe it's a b.o.g.o.f, ring up for one and they send another free. Perhaps you get a cup of tea and watch a video on your way to hospital. Or maybe they drive at 70 miles and hour instead of 40.Or, if you have broken one leg, you can break the other free of charge and only make one journey instead of two. Perhaps they are introducing a loyalty card where you collect points for each call out, double points if you share the ambulance with your neighbour.I think this sale will prove very popular, it might be worth getting all your ilnesses and accidents over and done with in the summer. Could save you a bit of time and money ;o)"}, {"title": "The Minack Theatre. A magical experience", "date": "Sunday 13 June 2010", "text": "I'm getting there, Day 11. Because I got an earlier flight back, there was time to visit the Minack Theatre at Porthcurno, I went straight there from the airport. I love live theatre but have stopped going because the price of tickets has gone up and up, and as with a lot of other things, entertainment has been taken out of the, 'need' box and put into the, 'want' box, and we all know you can't have everything you want. But for this holiday I have allowed myself a few indulgencies, and a theatre ticket is one of them.When I checked the web site I was thrilled to see there was a performance on the day I returned, well you can't not go can you. I didn't care what the performance was, just the experience of it was enough, so I booked it. They have an excellent web site by the way, with a live web cam and a 360 degree panoramic viewer.http://www.minack.com/Minack in Cornish means 'a rocky place'. The amphitheatre was created by Rowena Cade. She was born in 1893 in Derbyshire, and died in 1983, having built most of the theatre with her own hands. It is a remarkable story, if you would like to know more, please look at the history page on the web site.But for now, here are my pictures. The seats are cut into the steep rocks.The backdrop is the sea.The titles of the plays performed at the theatre are etched into the backs of the seats.The Royal boxes on the side of the rocks.It's very hard to imagine such a dramatic setting, you have to be there to experience it.Click on the pictures to make them bigger, then click again to enlarge more.After checking in at Lands End Hostel I went back to the Minack for the evening performance. You are encouraged to come early and take a picnic, and lots of warm clothing. I took my packup, a warm jacket, a cushion, and a blanket to cover my legs. Believe me you need it, but I was as snug as a bug in a rug. At about the halfway point it was starting to get dark, and after the interval they put the spot lights on. With the moon directly behind the stage, shimmering across the sea, it was magical. A beautiful memory to take home with me."}, {"title": "Beats sitting on your bum", "date": "Saturday 12 June 2010", "text": "I took a few snaps of my walk yesterday, thought you might like to see them. After two weeks of not going very far, I was ready for getting out again. I had another trip to the Lincolnshire Wolds, and a bit more of the Viking Way, starting at Fulford.Oil seed rape, don't you just love it, it's everywhere, a bugger to walk through though. It's as high as my shoulders, the farmers have to leave the footpath clear through the middle though, but when it grows you fight your way through trying to avoid all the buzzy bees going about their daily business. I came out the other side covered in yellow dust.On the map it said Medieval Village of East Wykeham and remains of church. Here is the church, a few stones remain standing, just, probably most of it was knocked over by the cows grazing the land. As for the medieval village, a bit disappointing. I was hoping for a few bits of bone lying around, the odd rib or leg bone, maybe the odd cooking pot or two, but nothing. Just a lumpy bumpy field. I think they can cross that one off the next map they print, it aint there no more ;o)Here is Wykeham Hall, a spooky place if you ask me :-OAt the end of Sandy Lane there are huge stacks of chopped down trees, such a shame to kill a tree. Looks like it has been there for some time, the wood is well weathered with weeds growing over it.Stacked up bags of what I imagine is some kind of fertiliser. Possibly some of this will end up on our dinner plates. Note to self, make the effort and grow a bit more veg in my garden.What a novel idea. A big tree comes crashing down, on a very windy day perhaps, don't bother to pick up the massive trunk now laid on the ground. Bring the chainsaw and cut a few chunks out of it, result a very handy seat for any weary traveller to take a rest. Love that idea.This sad little church made me cry, it is St Helen's at Biscathorpe. The door was open so I looked inside. It's as if time has stood still, everything is old, crumbling, and dusty. There are hymn books and bibles with yellow edged pages which you daren't touch in case they fall apart, an old pedal organ, some of the windows are falling out. Someone has made an attempt to brighten it up with a big silk flower display. The notices on the board are asking for money to keep it going, I fear they are fighting a losing battle. Outside, the churchyard is covered in buttercups and most of the gravestones are either buried under vegitation of have been stolen, because there aren't many left. But look at the beautiful ornate stonework on the top of the building, how fabulous is that. It stands almost alone apart from a house next door which is empty and has been boarded up. It's in a field, with a narrow road 500 yards away, well off the beaten track. You only get to see these things when you explore by foot. How sad that this church may be left to crumble just like the one at Wykeham. What a contrast, St Andrews Church at Donington on Bain.I came across these little fellas in their own little paddock complete with duck pond. They waddled towards me eager to introduce themselves. I had a nice little chat with them. They said, 'wadaya got to eat', and I said, 'who's a pretty boy then'. I think we got our wires crossed somehow, ha ha.There was a lot of walking along the edges of fields, a lot of them growing next years breakfast.Someone has left four gigantic soup dishes lying around.I went for a closer look, the sign on the gate says I am being filmed.They are covered in grafitti, so much for the cameras. I wonder where thay have come from, they are a heck of a size. Maybe Cyberkim has the answer. Some kind of tracking device maybe?Just as I got back the sun was beginning to go down. I took this picture from my friends paddock at the back of the church, looking down on the garden of the house behind it. Looks kind of exotic with the palms, that's the river Trent down there.I really shouldn't have walked so far, trouble is I get carried away and never know when I've had enough before it's too late and I am knackered. 19.5 miles, whew. I thought about my reasons for going walking, it's obvious isn't it, I am creating memories. In fact that's probably the reason why I do most things. Beats sitting on your bum and doing nowt :0) I'll be back tomorrow with some more holiday pics."}, {"title": "A day off", "date": "Friday 11 June 2010", "text": "Can I have the day off from blogging today please, I have walked 19.5 miles. I've just had my dinner, a shove it in the microwave job, it's 10.15pm, my feet hurt, and my brain has packed up for the night. Thank you very much, I'll be back in the morning."}, {"title": "Another Island hop", "date": "Thursday 10 June 2010", "text": "The day after. Another day of island hopping, this time I'm off to St Martins. A couple of pics of The Scillonian on the way out. The islands would grind to a halt if this boat packs up, everything comes across on this. It's unloaded at St Mary's, the cargo is sorted out, and anything for the other islands is reloaded onto a smaller ferry.The Scillonian has been sailing back and forth for 32 years, It doesn't sail on a Sunday so you can't buy any Sunday papers untill Monday.Here is the smaller ferry unloading it's cargo at St Martins. The island is that small people come and collect their own supplies in their pick ups and vans, when they know it has arrived. There is a haulage firm which delivers the goods on St Mary's, but I didn't see one here.I have noticed that there is no litter strewn about, everywhere is spotlessly clean. Such a refreshing change, I bet they don't even know what a litter picking stick is, ha ha. They are very hot on recycling as well, everyone has these little wooden sheds by the side of their house, containing their wheelie bins. All the rubbish is sorted out and the bin men come along and take it away. They don't have to put the bins out on the street, they can easily be reached, just open the door at the front. Their streets look a lot tidier than ours.St Martins is very small, less than 200 residents. There is a hotel which employs some of them, but most have to make a living whichever way they can. You see signs on the side of the road advertising places to eat and drink, tea shops, gift shops, and art galleries.People grow things in their garden and sell them at the front of their house on a table, or a miniture market stall like this one. Just leave the money in an honesty box. Talking of honesty, no one bothers to lock their cars, or close the windows when they leave them. They even leave the keys in the ignition. Wouldn't it be nice if it was like that everywhere.I had a good walk on St Martins, and came back to St Mary's just after lunch time. Another walk before I picked up my salad from the Co op and headed back to the hotel. A night in front of the tele. The weather isn't too good tonight. The last day on St Mary's. My flight back was originally booked for 4.40pm but I changed it to an earlier flight. I checked out of the hotel at 10am, there is a bit of time left to walk some more. Nearly all the roads and paths are now highlighted on my OS map, there aren't many that I haven't walked. To be honest, as much as I love the place, I am beginning to get a bit claustrophobic. I wouldn't want to live here, I am a free spirit and don't like any boundaries. It was the television programme An Island Parish which brought me here, I was hoping to meet a few familiar faces. The owner of the hotel said she would introduce me to Heike the vet, but when I asked her she said she was too busy. I thought that was a bit unfair. But I did meet Heike briefly, by chance. I was standing at a road junction making a few notes in my notebook when a car pulled up to turn round. I looked up and saw it was Heike, she has her name on the side but she is instantly recognisable. I was a litttle bit startled and said 'hello Heike'. No time to engage in a conversation, she had to rush off because she had a calf waking up from an anaesthetic and had to get back to the surgery. I saw her again the following day, she was in the bank, her car parked outside on a yellow line. Nobody bothers. I did meet Fraser the boatman and had a little chat with him. His boat The Sea King is immaculate. He was very polite, he was just finishing work and heading off home with his daughter who works for him. Carol was busy at the airport cafe, so I didn't but in.My last walk around the coast took me right over the top of the end of the runway. I looked out to sea to check nothing was coming in to land before I dashed across, the sign says 'No Loitering'. I can see how you might get carried away taking photographs, and not notice the airbus about to give you a close shave, ha ha. Goodbye Scilly Isles. A little bit sad to go, but I still have some more places to visit.You can see the Scillonian at the end of the quay.Leaving St Mary's behind. Isn't the sea a beautiful colour."}, {"title": "Red hot bargains and a dead cheap curry", "date": "Wednesday 9 June 2010", "text": "Thank you Mr Tesco for my bargains. The other day I bought these strawberries and cream, now eaten. The strawberries were reduced from \u00a31.75 to 50p, and the cream was free. I wouldn't have been able to afford these little luxurys at the full price, so ta very much.Yesterday I did my weekly shop, I didn't need much, but managed to pick up some more cheapies. I got a bag of ten bananas for 35p, wow, amazing. There was two bags and another woman was looking at them. I said they were a bargain. She said there was too many and they would go soft before she had chance to eat them. What is the matter with these people!!! They haven't gone soft yet, just eat two a day for the next five days, I wanted to shake her.The other bargains I got were half a cucumber from 45p to 16p, a big bag of spinach from \u00a31.80 to 45p, and four bags of radishes from 70p each to 7p. A lot of radishes to eat raw, so I cook them with my veg. I have just demolished this veggie curry. Chop up 3 radishes, a piece of cucumber, an onion, and half an aubergine which my friend gave me. Cook it in a splash of oil and some lemon juice. Throw in half a jar of Sainsbury's curry sauce, which cost 9p, yes 9 flippin p, and simmer for ten minutes while the rice cooks. Now I know why I never buy aubergines, they aren't very nice, not to worry, my belly is full ;o)The next day. Time for a bit of island hopping I think. After a full breakfast I walked to Hugh Town and the quay. You walk everywhere here, there is a little community bus but it hardly seems worth the bother of checking timetables and hanging around at bus stops, you might as well just put your best foot forward. You can get anywhere in about half an hour.Tresco seems to be the favourite place to go, and luckily there was a boat in ten minutes, I got my ticket from the kiosk on the waters edge. A beautiful sunny day again, my sunburn has calmed down a bit now, after a couple of days of covering up and lashings of sun lotion. A short boat ride and we land here, not very inspiring is it? Where are these wonderful tropical gardens I have been hearing so much about :-( I feel like I have been dumped on a desert island.I followed everyone else, and fifteen minutes later we were there. You get a little map as you go in, I turned right to the Valhalla Museum. I thought this might have some connections to the ride of the same name at Blackpool Pleasure Beach. Wrong, no rides here. It's a collection of figureheads which were recovered from boats that were wrecked on the rocks around the islands. Very impressive it was too.All freshly painted for the start of the new summer season. It's a shame they dont have beautiful works of art like these on the front of all modern day vessels.This stainless steel cube is a modern work of art. Balancing on a rock, it glitters in the sunlight.The creation of the Abbey Gardens began in 1834, extending over the grounds around the remains of the 12th century St Nicholas Priory. There are over 4,000 different plants here from all over the world.The exceptional hours of sunshine and the Gulf Stream, means the gardens have ideal conditions to thrive.Walking along Lighthouse Walk, looking towards Neptunes Steps.Palm Circle.You can imagine you are in the Mediteranean.There are lots of cacti.This is the Middle Terrace.This pretty little fella was as bold as brass, hopping along and approaching visitors, looking for a morsel or two.A bird of paradise maybe, it certainly feels like I am in paradise. Dont forget to click on the pictures to enlarge them. There is time to explore a bit more of the island before the boat returns, plenty of white sandy beaches to stroll along. Think I might go on another boat trip tomorrow."}, {"title": "Carefull as you go  :o)", "date": "Tuesday 8 June 2010", "text": "This made me laugh when I saw it today, a sign just as you go into the next village.Ha ha, someone wasn't driving very carefully when they hit it. It used to be a big planter full of flowers and someone demolished it, so they replaced it with a small brick wall. They aren't having much luck in Flixborough."}, {"title": "A Scilly Story ;o)", "date": "Monday 7 June 2010", "text": "I think I will take a little breather here, I feel like I have run a marathon around Cornwall. Anyone new finding the blog will wonder why I have got all those money saving tips on the side, and here I am spending willy nilly on a holiday. Those that know me will understand, so you can skip this bit. For years I worked hard and didn't have a holiday, all my money went into the house. I was never extravagant but I was just ticking along nicely, then I got fed up of work. My priorities changed, time for myself was becoming more important than earning money. I found ways of cutting down on my spending. I don't need a show house to live in, one that is simple and comfortable is enough. I don't need to go out and show off my new outfit, my charity shop clothes, old clothes from the back of the wardrobe, and ones that are given to me, are fine.I dont go around with a long face because I am looking at every penny I spend. I can go to town, just do the jobs I went to do, even browse shops, and still have a smile on my face having spent not a penny extra. It's a good feeling knowing that I am in control. I have been receiving the state pension for just over a year now, and I am managing quite well on it. I reminds me of the days when I was a teenager in my first year at work. The excitement of dividing my small wage up into different pots. Half of it for mum for my board and lodgings, five shillings for my club book. Do you remember those catalogues? Buy a dress or a pair of shoes, pay half of it off over several weeks, then scour through for something else and add it on, then pay that off. You have to be carefull not to get carried away and order more than you can afford. Then a pound or two for going out to disco's and youth club, and five shillings for a magazine and sweets. If you wanted something big you had to save up for it. I saw a bike in a second hand shop and put a deposit on it and went in weekly to pay for it. So this is what I am doing now, saving up for bigger things like holidays. This holiday has made a dent in my bank balance, but not one that is irreparable. If I pull in the reigns now it will be back to normal in about five weeks. The secret is not to let it drop below danger level, always keep a bit by for emergencies. Anyway, lets get back to the job in hand.Today is the day I fly. Here is my cute little aeroplane waiting for me. Just eight seats and the pilot, I am so excited. Ever since watching the series 'An Island Parish', I have wanted to go and see the Isles of Scilly for myself. This is what the whole trip is about. Because it is a long way from home it would be daft to drive hundreds of miles, fly over, then drive back again. Why not make it into a longer trip and visit other places. At check in I naively asked if I could have a window seat, how silly of me, geddit ha ha, groan. Every seat is a window seat, doh! The lady in uniform said it is loaded by weight and you didn't have a choice. When it was time to board I was disappointed that I couldn't sit up front, but as she called out the names I could see why I was at the back, me being like a wet lettuce leaf at just over eight stone :0) Wow, it was so noisy, I had to switch my hearing aid off to make it comfortable, no point in trying to make conversation with my fellow passengers. Half way across the pilots attention was taken by another aircraft which was flying parallel to us, they are buzzing around like flies here. As well as these little airbuses from Lands End and Plymouth, there's also the helicopters to contend with as well. Twenty eight miles and fifteen minutes later we were landing, you can see the runway on the right hand side of this picture.Almost down, the rocky coastline looms.Big grin on my face, it's lovely to be here.The time now is 9am, it doesn't take long to unload the baggage, a couple of holiday makers with big cases, business men with briefcases, me and a young lady with ruck sacks. Three minutes and we're on our way.I don't need to check in at the hotel till later, so with my os map that I printed off the computer I went for a walkabout. My hotel is in the middle of the island so I set off towards Old Town, then joined the coastal path around the bay, Porthcressa Beach, around the Garrison, to Hugh Town the capitol, and towards Telegraph Hill to the Hotel. There was no rush, a steady stroll to take in all the scenery.A little bit of rock climbing here, they looked like they could topple off at any moment.What struck me was the amount of flowers, both in private gardens and out in the wild. I think I have picked the right time to come. Here are just a few of them, so beautiful.I checked in at the hotel at 3.30pm, very nice I must say, it should be for the price, \u00a345.00 a night, good God, I must have had a seizure or something, am I mad? Didn't have much choice actually. I made several phone calls and they were all booked up, that's the problem with being a single traveller, not many single rooms. It was either pay up or drag my camping gear with me. Carrying extra weight would have meant paying for it on the flight, getting a taxi to the campsite, and getting all my own food, something which I have been doing while at the hostels. I think this justifies the cost of the hotel. At least I get an en suite bathroom, a tele in my room, and a massive breakfast as much as I can eat, and boy did I stuff my face :0) I declined the evening meal however, not even daring to ask how much it cost. The Co op shop did a very nice salad in a plastic box for two pounds, with a few nibbles, a spud in the microwave (there was a small kitchen we could use), and a can of cider, I was perfectly happy with my meal in front of the TV.When I checked in I was surprised to recognise the man on reception, of course, it was Alastair the photographer, he was engaged to Heike the vet. He seemed such a nice guy on the programme, but the cad turned out to be a bad 'un, he dumped Heike shortly before they were due to be wed. I restrained myself from telling him what I thought of him. He was all smiles, the rotter. Mind you, you never know what to believe with docu soaps. I wonder if I will meet Heike? The day after. Not so far to drive today, but I must get off earlyish because I want to meet Brianna at her place in Hale. I was in her kitchen having a cup of tea with her and her family at 9.30am. First we went a short walk from her house, she is lucky that she has fantastic views on her doorstep. Time for a photo or two. I have just added this one, Brianna set the timer and took it with her camera, clever eh :o) Then we came back and set off in her car. I have been reading about the old tin mines at Botallack and thought this would be a good place to visit. I was right, it was fascinating.It is situated in the St Just Mining District, one of the most ancient hard-rock tin and copper mining areas in Cornwall. Most of the principal sites lie within a spectacular coastal belt of 3.5 miles long and 1.25 miles wide. Some of the shafts have been drilled so deep they level out underneath the ocean bed.It's very peacefull here now but at the peak of mining the cliff tops would have reverberated with noise of crushing machinery and the bustle of miners going about their daily tasks. Mining was the life blood of the St Just area and hundreds of families depended on this ancient industry.These are the Crowns engine houses built on the cliff edge.In the distance is Pendeen Lighthouse. Time was getting on so I didn't think we had time to walk there.I love watching the sea crashing down on the rocks, the colours are beautiful.As we headed back in the car we made a short diversion to Pendeen to see the lighthouse. Sadly it was not open to the public, but our treat was an ice cream from the van parked there. A smashing end to a great day. Thank you Brianna.My next hop is to Lands End Hostel. Strangely it isn't at Lands End, but at St Just, not far from where we have just been. I checked in at 6.15pm. Lots of interesting people to talk to here, several that are about to attempt the long journey to John o Groats. A young 18 year old lad walking on his own, two young men cycling, and a bit older man on his moped. What a plucky lot they are."}, {"title": "The meeting of the Queens", "date": "Sunday 6 June 2010", "text": "The end of the previous day. It was great to meet Frugal Queen and her dearly beloved.

Later we retired to the lounge to relax in front of the tele. I don't know if it was the food or the wine but I was so full I had a job to keep my eyes open. Tonight I have the luxury of a comfy big bed, as opposed to making my own up on the hard matress of a bottom bunk in a hostel. Bliss.The next day. Today I am having a guided tour of Fowey, a place I had marked down as somewhere that looks interesting. It's lucky that Jane was born there, who better to show me the sights. And lucky that her mother lives there, so no jostle for a parking space, we have one waiting on her front drive.One of the fabulous views looking out over the River Fowey.There is a castle which we looked around, here is Jane and Mike.A view from the crumbling castle walls.The river is very busy with all types of boats. We sat for a while enjoying an ice cream in the sun, watching the comings and goings.Someone was loading a small boat onto a trailer. They secured it with a single piece of rope which surprised me. After all the loads I have seen dropped off the back of a lorry, I would have put a strap across it, or at least several more pieces of rope with good old hitch knots in them. Let's hope they weren't taking it too far.The little ferry was doing a brisk trade with cars and foot passengers wanting to cross the short stretch of water.The little town was busy. We did a bit of window shopping around the narrow streets, with gasps of, 'good God, look at the price of that'. I know these holiday places rely on tourists to keep them going, but here was one tourist who was keeping her money firmly in her purse. Looking is free.Back home again, and after a late lunch we sat outside in the sun. I want to take these two fluffy bundles of fun with me, they are delightful. Thank you Frugal Queen for a lovely day, and the gift of a Cornish Flag. It was so nice to meet another bloggerNow I'm off to the north coast of Cornwall, to Perranporth. The hostel was once a listening station and is perched on a stunning cliff top location overlooking a two mile sandy beach, a surfers paradise. There's time for a walk before bedtime, it's still hot and my arms and legs are getting rather red. Look at this for a view out of a hostel window. It's like another world down here, it could be a million miles from North Lincolnshire."}, {"title": "From Salcombe to Burgh Island", "date": "Saturday 5 June 2010", "text": "The following day. A lovely sunny start to the day. It's a pity I am only staying one night at Salcombe, it looks like there is a lot to explore. The car park here is shared with the National Trust for visitors to the gardens, but as they are not open today I don't have to vacate my parking place untill later. The warden very kindly lent me a map with a walk marked out which should take three hours, so off I went. The views over the estuary are stunning.I followed the coastal path to Sharp Tor.Some of the paths went very close to the edge, don't look down :-()Starehole Bay is lovely.Turning inland across the fields, past East Soar Farm towards Sharpitor, I came to Tor Woods. The ground was carpeted with bluebells, and wild garlic flowers, and the sun shining through the trees made it kind of magical.I made it back in three hours, and posted the map through the door. After a bite to eat I went back along the winding narrow roads with the hairpin bends towards Kingsbridge, and on to Bigbury on Sea. Burgh Island is the place I want to see next. When it is low tide you can walk across the sand, I was lucky, the tide was going out. It seems odd to have a tide on both sides of the causeway. There is a hotel which was built in the 1920's and has since been restored to it's original Art Deco style. There are also three private houses, and the Pilchard Inn which is run by the hotel. The sun was blazing hot so a good excuse for a half pint of refreshing cider, I sat on the wall watching everybody walk across.I do believe the hotel is very posh and rather select, judging by the high gates that block the entrance. I don't think they want any common or garden holiday makers like me wearing walking boots, traipsing through.This is the Sea Tractor which ferries people across the 270 yard stretch at high tide. The wheels go under the water.This is a picture looking towards the mainland from the island.There are a lot of footpaths to walk, even though some of the land around the hotel is out of bounds. Some lovely views of the coastline. Looks like I have a skirt on here, no, it's just my baggy knee length shorts, ha ha. I like them because they have lots of pockets. Oh dear, I appear to be sunburnt.Time to leave Burgh Island and head to my next bed for the night. This time I am not hostelling, but staying with Frugal Queen in Liskeard. Best pick up a bottle of wine on the way then, can't wait to taste some of her wonderful cooking."}, {"title": "Just swanning around", "date": "Friday 4 June 2010", "text": "Later that day. My next port of call, a short drive along the coast, is Abbotsbury Swannery, now is the best time to visit as the swans are hatching their chicks. I have missed the 12 noon mass feeding but will make the 4pm session. Swans are such beautiful birds, and there are reported to be over 600 here, a sight well worth seeing I think.The huge nests were everywhere, even on the footpaths. The swans didn't seem to mind many pairs of feet walking past them. Large dustbin lid like dishes are put next to the nests and topped up with water and food. In the wild the swan would have to leave the nest to forage for sustenance, leaving the eggs and chicks vulnerable to predators. Having everything close to hand means the chick survival rate is higher.Mother swan was close by watching over her babies.A lovely sight to see, but at \u00a39, rather expensive to get in ;0( Never mind, I'll square it up with a cheapy walking day. I had a longish drive to my next Hostel at Salcombe, time to leave Dorset and go to Devon. But look what I found when I got there :o) Although I had a map the hostel signs are usually quite easy to follow. This one seemed to take ages to find, just as I thought I was getting close yet another hairpin bend and a steep hill to climb. Crawling along in first gear I wondered what would happen if I met someone coming in the opposite direction, thankfully it was late and I didn't.This magnificent Edwardian building is high up overlooking the Salcombe Estuary. It is set in the National Trust gardens of Overbecks. I was lucky enough to be the only female guest so once again I had a room to myself. The window at the top right hand corner of the photo is where I slept, I felt like I was the lady of the manor."}, {"title": "A wooly story and a dash to Portland Bill", "date": "Thursday 3 June 2010", "text": "The day after. Up with the lark this morning, I've got quite a lot of mileage to cover to the next hostel. I was in the kitchen cooking my breakfast, porridge and peaches today, when I noticed two four wheel drive vehicles pull up at the gate to the field next door. They let themselves in and opened the tailgate on the pick up, four border collies jumped out, eager to get to work.I used to love 'One Man and His Dog', on the tele years ago, such intelligent dogs are amazing to watch, they obviously love their work. I remember when the first shepherdess won the competition, one up for the ladies, well done Katy Cropper. I can tell you a little story about her.I was at the Savoy Hotel for the Women of the Year Luncheon, and Katy Cropper was also on the guest list. She arrived with her dog as you would expect, they are a team. She was told that her dog would not be allowed to enter the luncheon with her, and the start of the event was delayed while discussions went on. Katy declared to the powers that be that if her dog couldn't come in then she wouldn't come in either. Management had to back down and her lovely dog lay by her side at the table all the way through lunch. Ahhhh, a happy ending.Now I was seeing sheep dogs work for real, this is a great start to the day. My breakfast was ready, I took it outside with me so I could get a better view of what was going on. Job done and all the sheep are awaiting their turn.I chatted to the young lady as they were getting ready. She told me they are from Lanarkshire, and they go all over the world shearing sheep. They have 350 to do here today.The farmer feeds them through a series of pens, and ejects the lambs, which are more like teenagers now. They are left to wander around outside the pens and wait for mummy sheep to come and claim them.The two lads worked fast to pop music blaring out from a portable radio, maybe this helps them to keep up a good pace. I timed how long it took to do one sheep, it was 90 seconds.Although it looks like they are rough handling the sheep, they hold every one of them in the same way. They wear soft leather slippers on their feet so as not to cause injury if they should accidentally step on one.That's another one finished, off you go. The young lady had the job of folding the fleeces and packing them into a big canvas bag. Lots of bleating going on as mummies look for their offspring after their makeover in the beauty parlour, ha ha.Well you learn something new every day. My early start has been delayed, I couldn't set off untill I did a bit of nosey parkering and took some photo's. Never mind, I am on holiday. I arrived at Portland at 10.30am and found a free car park next to the coastal path. The weather was a bit misty so the photo's are not as clear as I would have liked. I didn't bother taking any distance shots at first, visibility wasn't so good. I hoped I would have time to walk around the whole peninsula, but as I wanted to stop off somewhere else later I had to be content with a shorter walk. I followed the path past Verne Prison and the Young Offenders Institution, to Church Ope Cove. All that remains of the ancient church is a few stones outlining the layout and a few grave stones. From here I turned inland past Perryfield Quarry. The whole peninsula is covered in quarries, either working or disused, it's a good job it's connected to the mainland by a narrow artery, or it would sink :0) I love quarries, fascinating places.Looking down on the beach huts, or were they posh sheds?This very large majestic building was called Pennsylvania Castle. I've no idea whether it is a private house, a hotel, or what type of building it is, there was no signs to indicate who might live there. Stop Press! I've just googlied this and found a fantastic site. The castle used to be a hotel and is now a private residence. There is more information and pictures of the church behind it and the cove. Worth a look if you are interested. http://www.geoffkirby/portland/695710/I've just spent half an hour trying to get this link to work, and I've got to go out. Blooming frustrating, tried everythingArriving back at the car, the mist has cleared a bit, worth trying some photo's. These were taken looking out over the docks and marina at Castletown. Fortuneswell is at the bottom of the steep cliffs, and you can just about make out Chesil Beach as it disappears into the distance.Just time to drive to Portland Bill at the tip and take a photo of the lighthouse.A place to come back to later, I think.Back down to earth with a bump now :0) I've got Henry choc lab here with me waiting for a walk, he's coming again tomorrow, and then I'm looking after Ben over the weekend. The diary is looking pretty full for June, not much time for breathing, ha ha.I've made a start on the hedge trimming, I have a fairly long Leylandi hedge, 6ft tall so I need to get up and down on the stepladders. I thought about making the job a bit easier and getting an electric trimmer, but that wouldn't be very frugal. Also we have to cut down on our electricity use because in a few years time we will be facing blackouts when it is rationed. It aint going to last forever :-( So it's onward and upward with the shears.I went into the 20 21 Arts Centre yesterday, to pick up a copy of the latest brochure which lists future exhibitions and events. There is my name for all to see, I shall be there on the 31st of July showing my craft work. They are having some workshops over the week, although I won't be running them they are using some of my ideas for which I get the credit for. I know it sounds a bit barmy but I have had to be CRB checked just to set up a table and talk to people, because children will be around. A bit over the top if you ask me, but I went along with it because the council pay for it.My gas and electricity bills arrived while I was away, and my cat sitter friend Janet duly paid them with a cheque I left for her. Thank goodness they are back to normal, a big drop from last time. Gas was \u00a342.64, down from \u00a396.89, and electricity was \u00a323.44, down from \u00a345.99, and both meters were read. Big sigh of relief, that's more like it.Henry is pestering for a walk so gotta go. I'll be back later with another holiday report."}, {"title": "Monkey World and the Jurassic Coast", "date": "Wednesday 2 June 2010", "text": "The next day. I have always wanted to visit Monkey World ever since I saw it on the TV a few years ago. The series was called Monkey Business and I looked forward to watching it week by week. It was like a soap opera, all the residents had names and they all had a story of how they came to be there.The 65 acre park is home to over 250 rescued and endangered apes and monkeys. Many of them have been neglected, kept in unnatural conditions or experienced unbelievable cruelty. Monkey World was set up in 1987 by Jim Cronin to provide a permanent stable home for abused Spanish beach chimps. Sadly Jim passed away in 2007, but his wife Alison continues to work with foreign governments worldwide to stop the illegal smuggling of primates from Africa, Asia, and South America.I am thrilled to visit this wonderful place today.The monkeys were very entertaining and put a smile on everyone's face. I wondered who was watching who, as they seemed to enjoy our company and take great delight at studying the faces on the other side of the fence. Some people say you shouldn't cage wild animals, and on the whole I agree, but these have been rescued from some awful conditions, and this is the best chance they are going to get. Their enclosures are massive, they have lots of space to do what monkeys do, and to live out their lives in safety, and with love and compassion.Jim Cronin was in his fifties when he died of cancer, he went back home to New York for treatment and sadly didn't return. This beautiful memorial is in a quiet wooded area of the park, almost completely hidden. A perfect place to sit for a few minutes and reflect on the wonderful legacy he has left us.After eating my pack up lunch in the park I went back to the hostel and set off for a walk along the coast. You can't go in an easterly direction from Lulworth Cove because the land is used by the army for target practice. If the flags are flying you go in the opposite direction and head westbound. This quirky tree in a front garden made me smile. Every bucket and spade left on the beach is hung here, doesn't it look pretty?Lulworth Cove is shaped like a horseshoe, ideal for messing about on a boat, or a spot of paddling, and dogs love romping and splashing about in the water.I'm on my way now, looking back at the cove.Walking along coastal path, fabulous views. A little bit further along this Jurassic coast I came to Durdle Door. This is a natural limestone arch. Apparently the word Durdle is derived from the Old English word, thirl, meaning bore or drill.Just after I passed this point I turned right acros the fields and returned to the hostel along a parallel path that followed lanes and the edges of fields. An enjoyable walk, and a pint of cider in the pub made it a perfect end to the day."}, {"title": "A trip to Brownsea Island", "date": "Tuesday 1 June 2010", "text": "Day 2 part 2. The day is not yet over. I got off the bus once we had landed back at Sandbanks, and lo and behold, there was another ferry waiting for me to board, couldn't have timed it better. So off I went to Brownsea Island.A few months ago I saw Piers Morgan presenting a programme about Sandbanks, on the BBC iplayer, it is claimed to be the fourth most expensive place to live in the world. Some of the houses are worth millions, especially those which have their own landing jetty on the waterfront. I wondered if there was anyone famous at home. Worth a look I thought, nope, no sign of anyone sunbathing. I could do with one of those telephoto lenses then I could peer right into their living rooms, ha ha.Our little ferry boat seemed to have attracted the army, who appeared to be in hot pursuit. Soldiers in camouflage were crouching in their boats, rifles at the ready. No shots were fired, just a lot of shouting, the boats whizzed by us, looks like good fun I thought.Here we are arriving at Brownsea Island.I discovered that this is National Trust owned and I had to pay a further \u00a35.50 to walk around the island, on top of the \u00a35 ferry boat ticket. I pleaded with the young man on the desk, 'I am a poor pensioner and don't have much money', but it didn't get me anywhere, I had to cough up or go back on the same boat.Basically it is a nature reserve so I went walkabout. The church looks very nice, all neat and tidy. I'm not sure whether the parishioners would have to pay to come to the services.Scouts and guides have summer camps here, this is a stone commemorating the first one. This is one of the few places where you can see red squirrels, and I was lucky enough to catch sight of one. I was inside the visitor centre reading up on the history of the place, when I glanced out of the window to see a squirrel just the other side of the glass. They had attached a wire mesh box to the outside which had an opening for the squirrel to get inside and eat the food put there. A nice little bonus sighting for me. The last ferry back left at 5pm and I made sure I was in plenty of time. Here it is just arriving.I got on and another ferry pulled up alongside which was going to Poole. The lady with the hair down to her bum was driving our boat, I think it's great to see women doing unusual jobs. She told me she works 8 till 5.30 and goes backwards and forwards all day, with a 20 minute break, and she never gets bored. Nice job to have on a nice day.Walking back to my car, I had a snoop around the back of some of the posh houses, They don't appear to have a garden at the back, just big gates straight into the garage. That wouldn't suit me at all, how awful to be squashed into a small plot with just enough room for the house.Anyway, this is my house for the next two nights, the youth hostel at West Lulworth. It may not be flash, looking a bit like a big shed, but it's at the end of a quiet lane, and surrounded by green fields full of sheep. It's cosy inside, only me and two other people are staying, and I have a room to myself. Fantastic."}, {"title": "Sandbanks to Harry's Rocks", "date": "Monday 31 May 2010", "text": "Second Day. Early start today, places to go, lots to do. A filling breakfast at the hostel. I was entertained by an amusing grey squirrel performing acrobatic manouvers just outside the dining room window on a hanging bird feeder. I quite like these cute 'tree rats', as some people call them.I wasn't sure about parking at Sandbanks so I asked the chef for advice. He said ignore the large car park as you get there and carry on round the loop at the end, it is free parking with no restrictions on the road. He was right. I would have thought that all the posh residents would be up in arms about every Tom, Dick, or Harry parking right outside their multi million pound homes. I could see why they weren't that bothered though, high walls, electric security gates with intercoms, and tall trees giving ample screening to their investments. Once they have barricaded themselves into their little fortresses they couldn't give a toss about what was going on in the outside world.Right at the end of the loop, at the entrance to Poole Harbour is a ferry which takes cars, buses and people travelling by any mode they wish, the short distance to the other side. It is very busy because it is a heck of a distance for anyone wanting to go to Swanage and the Isle of Purbeck by road. Just as I arrived it was getting ready for off, I quickly put my one pound coin in the machine and got a ticket.This drive on drive off ferry is quite interesting, it does not travel across the water by it's own means, but is pulled by huge chains which go under the water. If you want to read more about this, here is the web sitehttp://www.sandbanksferry.co.uk/The man in his crows nest driving, or is it piloting, the ferry.It has room for 48 cars.The huge chains which propel the diesel-hydraulic craft.Stepping off the other side at South Haven Point, the view across Shell Bay.I had intended to stay an hour or so there, just so I could say I had been on the ferry, but when I saw this sign for the South West Coast Path, I had to explore a little further.I walked along the beach for over an hour and saw the white cliffs in the distance. In my dream like state and enjoying the glorious sunshine, I hadn't noticed the warning signs. Looking across to the sand dunes, I blinked and looked twice, then quickly looked away. It was a surprise to see people without any clothes on. Oh well, each to their own I suppose. I was more interested in the coastline up ahead.Passing through the lanes of Studland I came across this pretty pub, The Bankers Arms, which was almost totally covered in a creeping ivy like plant. No time to stop, must press on, I have some ground to cover if I want to get back and take the other ferry to Brownsea Island.It seemed a long trek to Old Harry, as the white rocks are named, I kept stopping briefly to admire the view. I came across two men with huge cameras on tripods who were filming right close to the edge. Me being nosey I asked if they wanted to film me, never one to miss an opportunity, ha ha. They said they were filming for a local TV news station because a dog had fallen over the cliffs a few days before. I wish they hadn't told me that, it certainly put a dampener on my day, the poor dog. Why are people so stupid as to let their animals wander loose in such a dangerous place.I tried to put the dog to the back of my mind and took some more photo's. The scenery was certainly stunning.These are The Pinnacles, just around the corner from Harry's Rocks.I asked a nice young lady to take a photo of me, modelling my new sun visor.The ferry coming out of Poole Harbour on it's way to France.Time was getting on and I needed to get back pretty sharpish if I was going to Brownsea. I backtracked to Studland and took the footpath past this Norman Church.At the other end I came out onto the road, aha, a bus stop. Oh good, there is a bus in ten minutes, lucky I have my pass with me. I hopped on and was back on the ferry in ten minutes, still on the bus. Did I get to Brownsea? Keep reading."}, {"title": "Day one, saying my prayers", "date": "Sunday 30 May 2010", "text": "It wasn't a relaxing holiday, there was no time to chill out and do nothing, always on the move, always something to keep me busy. If I wasn't driving, or walking, or sightseeing, I was planning my next move. The only time I did put my feet up was in the evening in the hotel on St Mary's, I actually got to watch a bit of tele, now that was a novelty, flicking through the channels.I must have walked a fair distance, didn't check it but I had my walking boots on every day. The scenery was fantastic, I did lots of bits of the South West Coastal Path, and I can see now why people like to do the whole lot, it was beautiful, I fell in love with it. Just when I thought I had stumbled upon the best sight ever, I turned a corner to find an even more breathtaking view. Some parts of it brought tears to my eyes, I was in awe of the sheer beauty of the cliffs and the rock formations, the force of the waves as they came crashing down around them. The surf of a clear blue sea rushing onto the pure white beaches, the abundance of wild flowers carpeting the ground, and the blue skies and sun looking over me. Someone up there was making sure everything worked out fine, I had a lovely holiday, I was so lucky.I am not going to overload you with a chronicle of every detail, I will make it a series of day trips out. I wrote a diary to help me remember it all, and picked up loads of leaflets, I hope you find it interesting.Here is the Youth Hostel at Salisbury. It is a 200 year old secluded villa set in private grounds, close to the city centre. When I drove up the long sweeping driveway and caught sight of it my first thought was, 'wow, look at that'. After my walk around the town I came back to cook my dinner, and ate it outside at the picnic tables. Breakfast is included in the price at this hostel, which is quite rare, mostly it is optional with an extra cost of \u00a35. At all the other hostels I was self catering, trying to keep the cost down, besides I don't normally like a big breakfast. The staff were very friendly and helpfull, nothing was too much trouble. In fact I find all hostels are run by friendly people, that's why I like them.Of course, if you are in any city with a cathedral you have to go and have a look. This one is fabulous. I couldn't get many photo's because a large part of it is covered in scaffolding where they are renovating it, but these will give you an idea.The spire at 404ft is Britains tallest.It has Britains largest secular Cloisters with newly landscaped gardens.It has the earliest surviving complete choir stalls in Britain.Some more facts. It has Europe's oldest working clock. 1386The Chapter House is the home to the best preserved of the four surviving original 1215 Magna Carta. Tomorrow I'm going to Sandbanks to see where the posh folk live. Hi there, I'm back. I have been to that many places, I feel like a globe trotter. I woke up yesterday morning in Boswinger hostel near St Austell and it was raining and overcast, not a nice start to my last day. Also the hostel was due to fill up with more children last night, and I didn't fancy the scramble to use the bathroom and kitchen facilities, so I felt the best option was to head off back home. Not before a visit to the Eden Project however. I left there at 2.45pm, called in to see my sister for a coffee, arriving back at midnight, with a total of 1,075 miles driven.I feel whacked, the car wants unloading, the runner beans and peas want planting out, I need to go and buy some food because I emptied the fridge freezer before I went and I am craving fresh vegetables, and Lilly cat wont leave my side. I will get the photo's sorted out in some kind of order today, that's going to be a job and a half.

It's 240 miles door to door. The hostel is beautiful, a large white building a bit like an old fashioned ranch with a verandah, set in it's own grounds, close to the town centre. A massive tree is at the front and it's surrounded by bushes, lawns and I've seen two pussy cats. I cooked my simple meal in the members kitchen, cous cous with a tin of mackeral fillets, got to keep the cost down.My room mates are all nationalities, I have just had a lively conversation with two young girls from Canada who are backpacking over here for seven weeks, you should see the size of their rucksacks! I had to take a top bunk because all the lower ones were taken, hope I don't have to get up in the night for a pee, ha ha.Salisbury Cathedral is magnificent, although a large part of the outside is covered with scaffolding, they are renovating it.

My friend Karen who lives behind the church has a big brown one and a little white pony, and when I am passing I pull up handfulls of grass that they can't reach, and feed it to them.Last week I decided to adopt a horse from Bransby Rest Home for Horses, near Lincoln. I have made donations to this charity before, but I thought it would be nice to have a connection to a particular resident there. There are eleven to choose from and I picked Craigie Boy, an ex race horse.This morning I received my certificate, isn't he a handsome boy.They also sent me a laminated picture to put on the wall, a rosette, a key ring, and a notebook, and they will send me news of his progress throughout the year.I am so thrilled, my very own horse. Well I don't suppose I actually own him, perhaps just part of him, a very small part, well ok, maybe just his left ear, ha ha.They tell me he is always the first one waiting at the gate for his breakfast and tea. He has made friends with new arrival Percy, another ex racehorse, and they are often seen galloping around the field together. Aaahhhhh, how nice, he sounds like a happy chappie.Just a couple of updates on the cats I previously mentioned. Remember Mr Beasley? He is still with Sue in a chalet in her garden. He now shares with Bobby and they have become great friends. Bobby may have a new home to go to shortly, and there is a lady who lives opposite Sue who is seriously thinking of taking in Mr B. He looks lovely now, and enjoys being groomed. All his knots have gone and his coat is silky soft.Lucifer, the black cat who was taken into care because his owners are very ill, has sadly had to be put to sleep. Although he was very poorly we hoped he would have a few more weeks. He went to live with Janet and her cats and settled in very well. She has a big garden and he was able to stroll around in the sun. But the tumours on his kidneys were inoperable and he drifted in and out of consciousness, a genetic condition that no one could do anything about. It was kindest to ease his suffering. We are all very sad. Janet is doubly upset because it was only a week ago that she lost one of her own cats. All we can do is give them our love while they are here."}, {"title": "How very dare they!", "date": "Thursday 13 May 2010", "text": "Our council are on the ball where household recycling is concerned, their enthusiasm is commendable, but a little over the top sometimes. They supply us with three wheelie bins, a red one for cardboard and plastics, brown for garden and compostable waste, and a grey one for general rubbish that can't be recycled, this goes to landfill.Then we have two plastic boxes that we put out on the pavement once a fortnight, a blue one for paper, and green for glass and tins.I am a keen recycler as I believe we should not be throwing everything into a big hole in the ground, so I diligently sort out my waste and put it in the right container.However I have just had a letter from the council, not addressed to myself, but a general letter with just the address on the front. It was posted on the other side of the country, in Ellesmere Port. It says, and I quote....'During April 2010 it was noted that a number of homes in your area did not present material for collection'.It was in reference to the boxes, it then goes on to explain what should be put into them. I was furious, how dare they send me this letter. Do they think I am dim, or can't be bothered. I was on the phone immediately to the Waste and Recycling department.I explained the reason for not putting my boxes out on the collection dates, I have a perfectly simple and logical answer. I create very little to put in them. I don't buy newspapers or magazines, so it's only the free papers and junk mail that goes in the box. I drink hardly any wine maybe a couple of bottles a month, and I eat mainly fresh food. In the picture you can see an empty wine bottle and an empty olive oil bottle, most of the cans are from Ben's dog food.  What is the point of putting my boxes out every time when there is so little in them, why make the lorry driver stop for such a piddling small amount, and what a good idea it is to wait untill the boxes are full before I put them out. By the time I had finished my rant the woman was apologising for sending the letter. I should think so to.  After I put the phone down I noticed a council van parked outside, two young ladies have been hovering around for a week or so. I have spoken to them before about recycling so I went out to ask them about the letter. They told me that the council send people out to do surveys on collection dates to see how many are putting their bins and boxes out. All those who haven't, get the letter. How ridiculous is that. What about people who are away from home for a long time for whatever reason, illness or holidays? What about people who do as I do and wait till they have a substantial amount to be collected? Why don't they knock on the door and ask at the time why they haven't put their box out?  Sending a letter is a sneaky way to do it, and I suspect it's just an excuse to give people a job. The council should stop harrassing innocent Joe Public and pay more attention to reducing the rubbish they collect from businesses. Phew, I had to get that off my chest."}, {"title": "The kids have been playing up", "date": "Wednesday 12 May 2010", "text": "I'm not cut out to be a mum. No, you're not hearing things, I dont have any children, but I feel like I am a mum to my two cats, and several dogs which I look after from time to time. Animals certainly take a lot of looking after, or is it just that I make hard work of it and they are easy really. Perhaps I fuss too much, do they want to go out, have they got enough food, do they want to come in, shall I leave the door open for them, are they happy?I have Ben dog staying here, the routine is get up by 7am, stroll in the garden in case he wants to do a whoopsie, I can't leave him out by himself because the garden is not secure, and he would root around under the bushes for any tasty cat poo morsels he can find. Disgusting! Come in, feed the cats, feed Ben, then I can have my breakfast. At 10am I took Ben for a walk.Today I have the key for a house up the road, the man has gone out and he asked me if I could let Scruff dog into the garden. So I did that at 11.30, I tried to take him for a walk but he didn't want to go. Although he knows me he is a rescue dog and was worried about going out without his owner.Then I managed to get a couple of hours off to visit the Scrapstore and the Arts Centre. When I got back I went to see if I could get Scruff to go for a walk. He went a short distance but I could see he was not happy so I took him back to his house and we played in the garden. I decided to clean the inside of my car, so I got the dyson out and pulled all the carpets out. I felt sorry for Ben in the house, as it was sunny I brought him outside on the driveway and tied his lead to the door handle. I looked up from my cleaning to see he had tied himself in knots with the lead and was pulling towards the back garden, so I took him onto the back lawn and tied him to the line post. He was ok with this as he could lie in the sun on the grass.When I finished the car I took Ben to Scruff's house, intending to walk them together, I thought Scruff would like the company of another dog. Ben did a poo on their lawn, I picked it up and we went a walk, this time a bit further. At last Scruff did a poo, which is what I was hoping for, it's not good for them to hold it for too long.By now it's 6.30pm, time for dinner. Scruff is in his house, his owner should be back soon. I have some minced beef to cook for Ben as a treat, and a piece of trout for me which I put under the grill. The meat is cooking and the animals can smell it. The cats are round my feet crying, and Ben is following my every movement in anticipation of a good feast. I nearly tripped over him as I moved around the kitchen, talk about kids getting under your feet.I prepare a salad, fry a courgette in oil, and put a spud in the microwave, to go with the trout. By now Bugsy cat is wailing because he is desperate to eat. The mince is cooked so I make two small cat size portions and one large dog portion. It is still hot so I put some cold water in the bowl and put the dishes into it to speed up the process of cooling it down. A few minutes later I put it on the floor and it is scoffed in two seconds.At last I can get my meal. I settle down to enjoy it. Not for long though. The fishy smell has attracted Little Blackie, the cat from up the road, he is always in here. I have to stand up holding my plate as he tries to mug me. Thankfully he gives in and goes away. Now I can eat.I've had a busy day with the kids today, and still one more Ben walk to do before bed time. I'm not cut out to be a mum.I was talking to my neighbour yesterday after I had come back from shopping, telling her that I had bought my food to take on holiday. I said I wouldn't be taking a cool box because I will be moving hostels almost every day, and it wouldn't be practical to try and keep chilled food cool. I have bought more tinned and packet food than normal, simple things that don't need much cooking. I will have to make some changes to my diet for the two weeks I am away.For instance, I will have beans on dry toast, or porridge for breakfast instead of cereals. Her reaction was that she couldn't possibly start her day without her cornflakes. I wasn't surprised to hear her say this, as I believe people are so set in their ways they are unable to see the advantages of change.Ok I know I have said I eat steamed vegetables almost every day, and I hope to still eat them while I am away. I will take my steamer with me, and root vegetables do not go off as quickly as leaf vegetables. But there will be some days when I will not have the time or inclination to cook, then I will heat up a tin of soup, or have some cous cous with a tin of mackerel fillets.Because I don't feel tied to a particular eating regime, I can easily adapt to my circumstances, so when I need to cut down on my food bill I look for something that is just as good but cheaper. My tinned food will not be as cheap as preparing it from scratch, but for a few pennies more I will have the convenience of food not going off and having to be thrown away.I am busily eating up all the food in my freezer, so I can turn it off, then start again afresh filling it up. It's a good idea to have a clear out every so often, and it's a good idea to not be so picky about what you eat."}, {"title": "The sun in my eyes", "date": "Monday 10 May 2010", "text": "My poor sun visor has seen better days and needs chucking out. It has faded with the sun, and is starting to fall apart. I wear it nearly every day when I am out, I hate the sun in my eyes, and wear it even when it isn't sunny. It's great when I am driving, my own personal sun visor, I don't need the one in the car.I have prescription sunglasses, but it is such a pain to keep changing them when I go in and out of buildings. I thought about getting some specs with reactolite lenses but they seem to take ages to change from light to dark and back again. So my visor is the best for me. I have searched in every shop in town to find a replacement but no luck. So, only one thing for it, I will make another one. First of all take the old one apart and rescue the stiffener in the peak.I have a tie I bought from the charity shop for 50p. Measure from the narrow end a piece to go around my head with a bit extra for the velcro fastening at the back, cut it off. Then unpick the stitching in the broad end, remove the liner, and iron out the creases giving a flat piece.Use the stiffener as a template, mark around it on the wrong side of the fabric, and cut it out with extra for the seam. Make two of these. Then sew them together around the outer edge wrong side in, and turn it inside out. Insert the stiffener, pull it tight. Attach the band with pins, and stitch into place.I put a strip of extra fabric on the inside to hide the join. Then sew each end up. Make sure it will fit your head before you sew the velcro into place.And there you have it, a lovely purple silky sun visor. It looks great."}, {"title": "Dress up on the cheap", "date": "Sunday 9 May 2010", "text": "As well as washing the bedding in the machine, I'm also doing a bit of hand washing in the bowl today. From the age of thirteen I always washed my own clothes in the sink, firstly when we didn't have a washing machine, and then when mum got a twin tub, I still did my own. I didn't like the way the machine bashed the clothes about, and I certainly didn't want my frocks to go in the same wash as my brothers socks and underpants :o(I was very particular and took care of my clothes, with money being tight I knew they had to last. So a gentle hand wash and drip dry, hanging them out on the line on a sunny day, was my routine. Of course this meant I couldn't dress up to go out on a whim, it had to be planned. It often took a week to wash, dry, and iron something, so I had to make sure clothes were washed the moment they became grubby, and not leave them in the linen basket because I was too lazy.I found that my clothes never really wore out, they just went out of fashion. When that happened I adjusted them slightly with a few snips and a needle and thread. Looking through my wardrobe I have clothes that are so old, I can't remember when or where I got them from, so here are a few guesses.This colourful top was a dress with a black skirt. I don't like skirts so I cut it off, and now wear it with trousers. It is silky fabric, loose fitting and comfortable to wear. It's possibly about 20 years old. I wore this to my nephews wedding last year. Another top about the same age. It has an elasticated waist and drawstrings across the shoulders. Now this one has got to be 30 years old, I love this top. It's a light jersey material with threequarter length sleeves. I wear this one often. My posh frock, bought in 1988 to wear at the Women of the Year awards at the Savoy Hotel. If I go anywhere posh now, I always get this out first, it makes me feel special.  I can't remember when I last bought something new to wear, I get all my clothes from charity shops now. Just rememberd, my waterproof jacket, it was new but only because I couldn't find one second hand, so I think I am allowed that.  There really is no need for me to buy any more clothes, with everything lasting as long as it does. By carefully looking after your clothes you can save yourself a fortune."}, {"title": "Tonights sunset", "date": "Saturday 8 May 2010", "text": "I could see there was going to be a nice sunset tonight, and if I was quick enough I might catch some of it with my camera.

Dog sitting has taken over a bit at the moment, so I am not wandering off anywhere, however there is plenty to do in my crafty workshop.Here is a photo of the vinyl offcuts I get from the Scrapstore, no piece is too small, I save them all. They come from a company that makes lorry curtain sides, bouncy castles, canopies for market stalls, and large bags for the construction industry. I can go at any time and have a root around in their bin.I have a small round mirror which I got about 20 years ago, intending to make a frame with macrame, it never happened, so what to do with it? It's five inches in diameter.An idea, make a frame with the vinyl. Cut a round piece slightly bigger than the mirror for the back. Cut another piece for the front and cut the circle out of the middle. Then cut flowers out of as many different colours as I have, there are eleven, and find the same number of small coloured buttons.Sew the flowers and the buttons on first, evenly spaced out. Sandwich the mirror between back and front, keeping it in place with double sided tape. Not cellotape, but I think it's used in carpet fitting, it's very sticky. Also make a hook for the top to hang it up, stick it between the layers. Then hand sew around the outer edge with neat stitches to finish it off. And there you have it.I am very pleased with this, it looks lovely. I shall keep it because I can take it with me when I show my work at the Arts Centre."}, {"title": "Punch up looming?", "date": "Friday 7 May 2010", "text": "I was listening to the radio today, (in between dog walking), trying to understand what happens next. I am not very bright where the voting system is concerned, and can't understand why the Conservatives didn't win even though they had more votes and won more seats. It doesn't seem fair.Gordon Brown is still there even though he didn't win, and said he is willing to talk to Nick Clegg about an alliance. That's doesn't seem fair either. So now we have got three main parties who are heading for a big punch up to decide who is going to rule the country. That sounds like one hell of a battle.Why can't they all sit round a table and come to some kind of agreement where they all work together for the good of the country? Wouldn't it be nice if they were polite and pleasant towards each other, and not continually slapping each other down? What is it with men and power, why do they always have to fight to be top dog?

Well I've done it, put my cross in the square. Dithering right to the end, do I vote for the party or do I vote for the man. I stood there in the village hall, with the pencil in my hand, now which one do I go for. I looked down the list of names. Never heard of him, didn't recognise that one, and who is that bloke?There was one name I did recognise. I know who he is because several years ago I had a little job taking names at funerals, so those who had attended could be mentioned in the newspaper. The man in question turned up and told me his name, I started to write. 'No, no, that's not the correct spelling'. Oops, well I spelt it how it sounded, I don't think I will forget him in a hurry. I didn't put a cross in his box.The other name I recognised has been popping through my letter box on a regular basis for the past year. His enthusiasm for the job has been amazing, I must have received several tons of literature, detailing all the campaigns he has been involved with. On the bottom of one of these pieces of paper, it said it had been printed somewhere in the south of England. I was a bit miffed about that and sent him an email to register my disapproval. I asked why hadn't it been printed locally. I was impressed, I had a very detailed answer back within the hour, the contents of which I understood perfectly.It seems to me that he is one step ahead of all the rest, pity that he is not with the party I was leaning towards. Never mind, I decided to go with him anyway. He is a youngish family man with a responsible job, a decent type who makes time to communicate with ordinary folk like me. He'll do.While I have been writing this something amazing has happened, he must be psychic. I've just had a phone call from one of his team asking if I have been to vote yet.

Now I have never seen this, having no tele, but I have seen Aidan before in The Desperate Romantics, which I caught on the BBC iplayer. I was totally smitten by him in that production, he played a lovable philanderer, the type of character I find extremely fascinating. I'd forgotten how gorgeous he was untill I read this article this morning, now I have lots of cheeky thoughts in my head.

It is best that he goes in the car, even though it isn't far, the walk back up the hill is too much for him to cope with.Going down I put him in the front passenger foot well with the seat pushed as far back as I could get it. He is a big dog and only just fits in. The trouble is that he has to come out backwards so I have to guide his back end onto the pavement. Understandably he panics a bit, but he is ok once he finds solid ground underneath him. For the journey back I opened the tailgate of my estate car, and physically lifted him inside, to see if that worked any better. He seemed far happier at having plenty of room to lay down.Once we got home however, he didn't want to get out. The big drop must have looked like jumping off a building to him, and he doesn't jump at all now. I tried to get him towards the back of the car where I could lift him off, keeping in mind that I needed to be carefull not to do my back in. He wasn't having any of it. Aha, I have an idea. Get the wheelie bin laid on it's side pushed up to the car. It's a few inches lower so it's ideal to make a step with. Then get the old blanket I keep in the back, and lay it over the car and the bin so it all looks the same. I sat on the bin, enticed him out with some treats, then put my arms round him and lifted him from the bin down to the ground. Success :o)Anyway, I digress, this post is supposed to be about what I had for lunch today. I have a policy of never throwing food away, I eat everything I buy, even though it might be well past it's sell by date. Take these two crusty granary rolls for example. They were in a pack of four, reduced from 65p to 26p. I never buy white bread by the way, there is no taste to it. The date on the wrapper is 24th April, so you can guess by now, they are not only crusty, but also rock hard, even the birds would find them hard to break up. Not to worry, saw them in half with the bread knife, cover each half with margarine spread, zap in the microwave for a few seconds, top with slivers of cheese and zap again untill the cheese bubbles.Then find a few leaves of lettuce from the bottom of the salad box in the fridge, dated 23rd April, and add a grated a carrot from a bag dated 21 April. arrange attractively on the plate and tuck in. I have to add though that it took me nearly an hour to eat it, due to the bread still being rock hard. I had to be very carefull not to break my \u00a3800 four teeth bridge, and my two crowns.

I have been looking on the internet for interesting places to visit along the south coast, I don't know what we did before the www, it's marvelous the amount of information out there.I have booked to go and see a play at the Minack Theatre, not sure what the play is but apparently it's a place you have to visit before you die. It's an open air theatre cut into the side of a cliff, overlooking the sea. It looks fantastic, you can see it here....www.minack.comAnother place I am going to see is the Swannery at Abbotsbury, between Weymouth and Bridport.

The sensible thing would be to pass them on to a younger child, which is what happened in my family. I got my aunties clothes and my sister got my clothes. Here is another idea, why not make them into something else.I started this project about six months ago, but came to a halt when I couldn't think of an idea for the next stage. This morning I picked it up again, and my dear Lilly so wanted to help. It is a childs denim skirt, which I bought from a charity shop for 39p, and I've turned it into a bag.I didn't want to completely remodel the skirt because of all the work that would entail, unpicking seams, trimming and sewing up again. So I turned it inside out, stitched the bottom hem together and turned it back again. Then I inserted a zip at the top along the waistband, and put it away because I couldn't think what to use for a strap. Ideally a piece of denim to match the skirt would have been best, but I didn't have anything suitable.After giving it lots of thought, I had the idea of using pink fabric because the stitching and the button are pink, so I thought it wouldn't look too out of place. I inserted a pink lining, and covered the pocket with a pink patch. I cut a piece of fabric for the stripe across the front and stitched on some crystals for decoration, which I got from a chandelier I found in a skip.I have put a long strap on it so it can be worn diagonally across the body, although it would work just as well with a shorter strap over one shoulder.There is plenty of room in the bag for all the essentials that us ladies carry around, and maybe a few extras like a sandwich and a small bottled drink. This idea could be used on other items of clothing as well, such as a jacket or sweatshirt, cut the arms and collar off, or a pair of short trousers, sew the bottoms of the legs together.

I'm glad we didn't take him in, we could have been accused of cat napping.Update on Mr Beasley. He seems happy at Sue's for the time being till we can find him a home he likes, and will hopefully stay there. He has a new friend called Lucifer and they are happy to share a pen. Sadly Lucifer is poorly, he has had a scan and is found to have tumours on his kidneys. He came to Sue when his elderly owner had to go into a care home. Now he will be on medication for as long as he is comfortable, but he will be going to stay with another friend Janet, (my cat sitter) and her nine cats, untill the end of his life.

I found a firm that makes fitted carpets for cars and caravans, and the very nice production manager said I could rummage in his skip anytime and take what I wanted.

They are very busy and their skip is emptied twice a day so there is plenty more when we want it.Today I had a haircut, when it gets to a certain length it starts getting on my nerves. I had already trimmed it myself a few weeks ago, but now it needed a proper cut. I popped into a hairdresser I have used before, straight in the chair no waiting, and asked for a trim. The thing is when I take my specs off I can't see very much. I knew she was chopping away, which was a good sign. Remember the last haircut I had when the girl did more talking than cutting?Ten minutes later I was done, blimey, it looks as if I have been scalped, it's a bit short. Never mind, at least it will last a bit longer this time, maybe six months before it needs cutting again.There was a bit of a panic tonight, someone I know who lives down the hill rang me and said there is a pregnant cat who is close to giving birth, camped out in his mothers garden shed. He has asked around the neighbours to see if anyone knows who it belongs to and no one has claimed it. He was afraid that the dirty old shed was not a warm and suitable place for it to have it's babies.I rang my cat friend Sue, and she rang me back to say she had found a place for it at a cat shelter about ten miles away, so we went to pick it up. When we got there the cat had done a runner, it was nowhere to be seen. We were looking up and down the road in the pouring rain, we caught sight of several cats, even crawled on our hands and knees trying to get one to come out from under a car. Unfortunately it didn't fit the description, we were looking for a black and white cat, not easy when it is getting dark.So the best we could do was to leave the cat box and some food inside the shed with the door slightly open, hoping it would come back. I will go and check on it in the morning, and see if there is any sign of it.

I went to school for ten years from age five to fifteen, because we had to or mum would have got into trouble. I started work at the age of fifteen because mum couldn't afford to send me to further education, and I wasn't bright enough. Mum also needed my contribution to the family finances so I had to earn some money.At the age of eighteen I left home and got a flat because I wanted my freedom and independance. But I didn't really have my freedom because I had to work to pay my rent and feed and cloth myself. I met a man and nearly got married but turned him down because I didn't want to be tied down, so I suppose I was trying to cling on to what bit of freedom I had. I moved around a bit living in different places, I had a little bit of freedom then but still had to find work to pay my way. I was tied to my sense of responsibility for providing for myself. There was no choice, I had to work.Then I became a lorry driver and my freedom went right out of the window. I was a total slave to the job, working all hours, staying out overnight, never knowing when I would be going home. By this time I had bought my first house, the thought of being tied to a mortgage terrified me, I couldn't just up sticks and go, I had more responsibilities. Now I was a slave to my bank balance, bills started coming through the door, all these people were after my money, now I was also a slave to the utility companies. I felt totally bogged down, where had my freedom gone? When would I ever get off this treadmill? Several years later I met a man who promised me the earth. He said he wanted to be with me forever, we would be a couple. I moved house to be nearer to him and was waiting for him to make a move so we could live together. Three years later we were no further on, and no wonder, he was a control freak and I was his slave. People said I had changed, my personality had shrunk to nothing, I didn't have one it was gone and I became quiet and withdrawn. He was a bully, he wanted total control over me and I let him. It was three years of hell, but I didn't see it at the time, love is blind. Eventually I saw sense and ended the relationship, but he had destroyed my confidence. Slowly I got over it, well you have to don't you, it's either sink or swim, and I swam right to the other end of the pool and got out. I picked up the pieces of my broken heart and put it back together again. So I made a new life with my pussy cat Bugsybaby. But guess what? Now the tables have turned, the slave I am no longer, now I am the control freak. At last my destiny is in my own hands, never again will anyone tell me what to do. Yes I have a small mortgage, it's easily manageable and I could get rid of it. I have a house that I could sell if I wanted to spend the money, and my pensions are enough to pay for my simple life. Every morning I wake up and decide what to do. Never again will I be a slave to work, money, or men. Now I am the control freak ;o)"}, {"title": "A purrfect day out", "date": "Tuesday 27 April 2010", "text": "Whoopsadaisy, I have been so busy today, I forgot to blog, must put it on my 'To Do' list, ha ha. I've been out to visit my friends Janet and Alan at their cattery near Selby. I love going there, they have seven of their own cats as well as lots of happy boarders.  Janet had to go to the dentist in Ripon so I went with her for the ride, it was an opportunity to browse some charity shops, while I was waiting for her. I found a few oddments, a couple of small gifts and some ornaments I can use for crafting purposes. It made a nice change to be driven somewhere. I am feeling quite tired now, probably due to the fact that Alan did us a big meal when we got back. I was falling asleep after we had eaten, and now I am home I can't stop yawning.

Because you are all making me feel so guilty. Everyone seems so organised with their cooking, cleaning, and general orderliness of their lives. I used to be so efficient at organising my time, but what has happened? Now I gaze out of the window and feel no sense of urgency to do anything.I make mental notes of little jobs that need to be done, and promptly forget them. Sideboard looks a bit dusty, I must get the duster out. Car looks a bit grimey, must give it a wash. Running out of clean pants, must do a wash. Can't see out of the windows, must clean them. Oh bother, the grass is growing far too fast for me, must mow the lawn. And so it goes on, I am turning into a slob. Whoever wrote the saying, 'Don't put off untill tomorrow what you can do today,' probably didn't get out much, because if you continue to keep on top of things you wouldn't have much time left to do naff all. And doing naff all can be quite enjoyable, even though you might be in danger of turning into a slob, like me. Anyway, I've started a 'To Do' list, because I need some help to turn my chaos around. I have a 'going on holiday' deadline looming, and if I don't get organised things won't get done. It will cost me more because I wont have planned the food I need to take with me (self catering). My car will let me down because I wont have taken it in for a check, it's developed a strange knocking noise somewhere under the back end. My cat sitters will think I live in a tip if I haven't cleaned up, and even worse there wont be any food to feed the cats if I don't go and buy some. I must fine tune my holiday itinerary or I will be driving round willy nilly wasting time and money, and I must get some maps from the library so I can find the places I want to see. Other jobs on my 'To Do' list. . . Collect more scrap for the Scrapstore. Get my hair cut, and buy a colour, I fancy going red. Put some credit on the mobi, just changed service provider so I need to work out how to do that. Buy a new pink sun visor for my head, or make one if I can't find one in the shops. Work out a 13 mile route that me and my friend can walk, we want to do our own sponsored walk for charity. Sow some more veg seeds in the raised beds, nothing seems to be happening at the moment with the seeds I have already sown.Oh dear this is all rather overwhelming, my list is growing by the minute, I think I'll stop now.

I was glad to help out as Graham although retired, does a wonderful job of keeping our graveyard neat and tidy. He lives only a five minute walk away so it was no trouble to collect her. Another excuse for more walking. We went out twice for an hour each time, and she had a great time playing with Karen's two dogs when we met them on the hills. It was the first time Lady had been in my house, and she was fine with the cats, and they didn't mind her sniffing them. When I took her back I did a bit of litter picking.

From the reports in the press it appears that a lot of people have suffered horrendously complicated journeys taking much longer than the quick flight they had originally intended. Stories of running out of money, with nowhere to sleep, stranded miles from home, seem like the stuff of nightmares.But now it emerges that some people have found the experience of travelling great distances overland, a very enlightening and exciting adventure. Their epic journey will be a talking point down at their local pub for quite some time, long after the rest of their holiday will be forgotten. This has planted the seed that they may be missing out on many more adventures if they install themselves into a metal bird, and sleep all the way to their destination.The report mentioned that some people had returned to the UK on a container ship, and went on to interview a couple who discovered this mode of transport many years ago. They have taken many holidays on these huge floating warehouses, and the excitement for them was never being certain that the boat was actually going to reach it's scheduled destination. They said the crews were usually made up of all nationalities, and because there were so few passengers they were treated like VIP's. Even being allowed access to the bridge at any time, a treat they enjoyed at night. Their enthusiasm for their particular choice of transport meant that they had lots of time to explore places that they would have otherwise never seen if they had been flying.Years ago when I was working, getting from A to B by the quickest route was paramount. Places were measured in 'how long to get there' rather than 'how far away is it'. I lived life in the fast lane, literally. Foot flat to the floor and go like stink. My concentration on the road ahead was finely tuned, so much so that I didn't notice things along the way that might be interesting. I had no time.Now I do have time. I recognised a few years ago that I was spending too much time earning a living. Too much time worrying about money, it had to stop. I wanted to get off that fast jet plane and take the meandering cruise ship. Now I can stop off and see places that I never had time for before. This poem is very true. . . . . .What is this life if, full of care,We have no time to stand and stare?No time to stand beneath the bows,And stare as long as sheep and cows:No time to see, when woods we pass,Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass:No time to see, in broad daylight,Streams full of stars, like skies at night,No time to turn at Beauty's glance,And watch her feet, how they can dance,No time to wait till her mouth can,Enrich that smile her eyes began,A poor life this if, full of care,We have no time to stand and stare.W.H.

I have visited them several times, met the dedicated staff and volunteers, and have seen first hand the work they do.I settled down to read my newsletter as I ate my breakfast. I wasn't very far into it, page three in fact, the News page, when I had to stop eating and wipe the tears from my eyes. There are pictures of two horses which were removed from their owner and taken into care at Bransby, both of which were severely mal nourished. The rescuers gave them the names Carrot and Spud. Carrot looked terrible, I have never seen a horse looking so skinny with all it's bones protruding from it's skin. How anyone can be so cruel is beyond me.All charities are struggling for donations at the moment, it can't be easy raising funds. I shall continue to do my bit for the horses, I wish I could do more.

The shopping centre was busy. I'm not sure if it qualifies as a shopping centre though, it's more like a covered over mall, just one walkway through it, with some temporary stands down the middle. There's a florist who seems to be taking up more and more space, and a bloke selling Sky TV, who's always chatting on the phone and never seems to have any customers.I see there's a new stand today. Two young girls are manning it who are dressed up to the nines, with makeup so thick it might crack if they smile, and hair that is laquered so much it looks like a helmet you can take off. They stand there pouting, with their chesticles popping out, hoping to catch a few punters off guard.What are they selling? A poster asks two questions, Do you smoke? Do you want to save money? If the answer is yes to both, they then urge you to buy a packet of amazing electronic cigarettes. They look like the real thing apparently, and no one can tell the difference. Do people really buy these things? Have they gone totally bonkers? They buy the substitutes, but still have to go outside into the smoking shelters. They want to save money but they still spend it on this hairbrained idea.I think I must be missing something here, surely the best way to save money is not to smoke at all. And why would anyone want to be seen 'pretend' smoking, when everyone knows smoking is bad for your health, makes you stink, and will probably kill you. People who want to give up, and save money, can get help from the doctors surgery, they don't have to fall for this ridiculous gimmick. I am totally bewildered by this.Just up the High Street I spotted another advertising board outside a new mobile phone shop. It was like an old fashioned blackboard, the words were written in chalk, 'New Kids Tariff'. Buy a new phone and get zillions of free texts, and hours of free calls. Blimey, I can just see our tiny tots with a mobile phone strapped to their heads walking around talking to themselves, while they try and use up all their free calls.Think of all the money they can save by signing up for the Kids Tariff, they can spend it on 'pretend cigarettes', they'll look really grown up then, won't they. What is the world coming to! I can't keep up with all these modern ideas, I am beginning to sound like my mother.Oh, I nearly forgot, I went a walk today, it was a lovely sunny day. Didn't take many photo's though, here is one of a horse. I did 15.16 miles, and not a cough or a phone call in sight ;o)"}, {"title": "Entertaining Henry", "date": "Thursday 22 April 2010", "text": "Up at the crack of dawn today, well not quite, 7am to be exact, Henry wasn't going to let me lie in bed any longer. After a swift cup of coffee we were out by half past, and onto the hills . I took my litter picker stick and a bag with me because I noticed that the wood was looking a bit raggedy the other day, with lots of cans, bottles and fast food cartons lying about. I felt much better knowing I have beaten the litter louts, they chuck it and I will clear it up. I will not tolerate such a mess in our lovely village.Back home for breakfast, then an attempt to do some craft work. Henry was having none of it and pestered me for a game with his ball. Then I went upstairs and put the computer on. Five minutes later I heard a lot of barking and went to see what was going on. Henry wanted to go into the living room but Bugsy cat was sprawled out in the hall, having come out of the window because he was too hot in the sun. Poor Henry dare not try and get past him, and Bugsy was enjoying being top cat. It's funny to see such a big dog scared of a fat old pussy cat. They have never come to blows yet, but I think Henry knows his place.By 11.30 I could see Henry was getting bored and the easiest thing to do to entertain him is go for another walk. The sun is lovely again with a slight breeze. We went through the woods on the other side of the village, and along the edges of the fields. Henry stopped to nibble on some lush grass so I lay down next to him. I just love lying on the ground looking up at the sky, I am so attracted to mother earth. I lie down with the cats in my garden sometimes. It was an opportunity to get close to Henry and take a few snaps.This is what Henry likes doing best. He runs around frantically to find any drop of water he can, then dives into it. You just can't stop him.On the way back we met a man with a young German Shepherd called Ziva, and we walked together for a while. The two dogs were having great fun. I like to see dogs getting on with each other, it is vital to get them to socialise from a very young age, then there are less problems later on. Yesterday we met a man with a snappy spaniel type dog, who didn't like Henry very much at all. The man grabbed it by the collar and shouted at it, saying 'stupid dog'. I didn't say anything but I wanted to, I can't always think quick enough. It was the man who was stupid not the dog, for not having trained it properly. I've just had a phone call from Helen, she will be here in an hour to pick Henry up. He's snoozing on the bed right now, but you can be sure as soon as the door opens he will be leaping about all over the place with excitement. I'd better get his bag packed."}, {"title": "He is such a sweetie", "date": "Wednesday 21 April 2010", "text": "It's a beautiful sunny day here, and I'm full of the joys of spring.

Here is my pile of pots from the last three days, I suppose it's about time I washed them :o(There is no hot water coming out of my taps because I don't switch it on untill I want a bath, and the central heating hasn't been used for a few weeks now, I can manage without it, it's not cold any more.So it's down to boiling a kettle to wash the pots, and if I do it once every three days that's quite a saving on the cost of heating the water if you work it out over a period of time. The pile is a bit unsightly but I can live with it. I will use the smallest amount of washup liquid and the only thing I dry is the cutlery, everything else will stay on the drainer till it is dry. That cuts down on how often I have to wash the tea towel, which eventually reduces the amount of times I use the washing machine. I've just had the statement from my credit card company, now I have to pay for my next holiday, so the relentless money saving excercises continue. I must always stay on top of things, don't ever become complacent. Just because I have the money put by for this one, doesn't mean I can relax and take my eye off the ball.

I struggled to get out of bed this morning, my leg muscles were still sore, never the less I was determined to do another day. There is a lane close to the hostel which goes up the side of Ullswater, with a choice of two paths. You can stay close to the water or you can take the higher route which gives some good views over the lake. I took the high path. I'm on my own today so it's up to me to find the way.The weather today is much better, lots of clear blue sky, no sign of fog like we had yesterday. Today would have been the better day to go up Helvellyn, but when you organise walks several weeks in advance you have to take whatever weather comes along. You have to go come rain or shine, or fog. This photo is looking across at the hills we were climbing yesterday. If you click on the photo's they will come bigger, then click the back button to come back and carry on reading.Once you have climbed the first bit, most of this path is fairly level which I was pleased about. Any downward steps I had to make were so very painfull, I felt like an old lady hobbling along. I thought it might get a bit easier the more I kept walking. One view of looking back, the water is on the right.It was worth making a short climb up to get this view, here I am on a rock, ha ha. At this point I took two paracetamols, my aching muscles was making every downward step so painfull. Unfortunately the painkillers didn't reach my legs so I just tried to ignore it. Dont look too closely at this one, dont know why I put it in really, shows all my wrinkles ;o(There was lots of streams and waterfalls, so relaxing to sit and contemplate the meaning of life.I walked along the waters edge passing the boathouse at Howtown, the halfway point where the steamer sets sail. I thought I might take a ride on it but the timetable in the unmanned shed was a bit complicated and the boats were few and far between. I had already come across lots of walkers going in the opposite direction to me, apparently most people get on the boat first thing in the morning, take a one way ride, then walk back. I had chosen to walk first and maybe get a boat ride later, it was not to be so I carried on walking. A mile after the pier I did a u turn and set off towards Fusedale and followed the beck, the picture below is where I am heading towards.The next photo is halfway along the dale, looking back at Ullswater.And another shot from further on and a bit higher up. The views are stunning. I enjoy walking in the valleys as much as on the tops.At the top of the valley I did a u turn and came back on a parallel path along the tops, over Brownthwaite Cragg and Steel Knotts. I followed the ups and downs, looking down along the route I had just walked. I didn't have to climb this, but you have to while you are there, don't you!At the top and a fabulous place for a picnic. Not another soul for miles around, so peacefull and lovely.I didn't take any more photo's as time was getting on and I needed to crack on. Back into Howton I took a winding narrow tarmac road alongside Boredale Beck. Eventually it fizzled out to a rough track strewn with loose rocks. A clamber up to the top and I was on Boredale Hause, a peak where several footpaths come together. I spent a few minutes wandering around not sure of the way off, looking for the Cairn, when I came across a group of youngsters rough camping. Was I glad to see seven or eight tents and a lot of chattering teenagers. A friendly young girl pointed the way, and half an hour of scrambling down a steep path with my legs about to crumble underneath me, I was back in Patterdale. It was now 7pm so I have been out for ten hours. Trudging towards the hostel, hardly able to put one foot in front of the other, the sight of the pub 200 yards the other way was impossible to ignore. Stuff the cooking tonight, I thought. I ordered a pint of cider and a jacket potato with all the trimmings, and lowered my aching body into a soft and comfy chair. Bliss. Getting out of the chair was another matter. I staggered out of the pub, anyone seeing me would have thought I was intoxicated, an elderly woman wobbling down the road without her zimmer frame, ha ha. Todays mileage 14.64, about the same as yesterday. Brilliant!Day four. This is my last day and I have the option of packing up and going home. I checked out of the hostel at 9am, and decided to do a short walk before I went home, can't give up now, surely my legs will hold out a bit longer. Down the little lane again, but this time turning right towards Hartsop. It's a wide level track that passes through a couple of farms. At one place I was greeted by a spotty dalmation who rolled over for some tummy rubs, then a black cat entwined itself around my ankles asking me for some fuss, then I saw these black lambs and watched their amusing antics. What a lovely morning for a walk.In the pretty village of Hartsop I stopped to chat to a man with his three dogs, in his garden. He had a lovely stone cottage, and proudly showed me his vegetable plot. Everyone is so very friendly here, fellow walkers and local people alike. At the end of the village the road goes into a track as it follows Pasture Beck along Pasture Bottom.I took a few photo's along here because the scenery kept changing. Walking alongside the Beck. I must say that you don't get as many walkers along the valleys as you do on the tops, it makes for some very pleasant tranquil rambling along.At this point there must have been a lot of rock fall as I had to look very carefully for the path. The clues are worn grass and smooth rocks where many hundreds if not thousands of pairs of boots have passed that way. Now which way is it!That's better, found this path on the other side. This photo is looking back at where I have come from, you can't really get a sense of height and distance from a photograph.If you look very closely at the next photo, you can see a person wearing a red jacket. A couple passed me while I was sat on a rock having a bite to eat, so I decided to keep them in my view. I was now in a big bowl, surrounded by steep sides in every direction. It seems like a dead end with no way out, but if you keep going you find the way, going up and up and up.At the top there was a junction of several paths coming together, I looked up to my left, the path I had already chosen to follow, and was horrified by the sheer steepness of it, and the loose rocks. There didn't seem to be anything to grab hold of for stability, unlike Striding Edge where you used all of your limbs to haul yourself up and down. For once I was glad there were other people about, just in case I got into trouble. I haven't actually got any photo's of this climb because I dare not take my camera out of my pocket. Any distraction and I am likely to lose my balance. So, onward and upward, was I relieved to get to the top.And this is what I found when I got up there, the beacon at Thornthwaite Crag, which is on an old Roman Road called High Street. A good time to take a break, it was very windy so I took shelter behind a wall.The other side of the beacon, there is still some snow about.The path along High Street is fairly obvious as it is a popular route. This is looking down at Hayeswater on the left, I am doing an anticlockwise route around it. You skirt round a peak called The Knott, and descend the hill heading towards the corner of the water where the dam is.By now my legs are jelly again, and I am wishing I was on my way home. But as usual I have over stretched myself, and still have about two hours left to do back to the car. I followed the most direct route along Hayeswater Gill back to Hartsop, and retraced my steps back.I sank into my car seat with great relief, had a bite to eat, and set off at 6.30pm. As there was still a bit of daylight left I chose another route back. Down the A592 through Kirkstone Pass to Windermere, across to Kendal, the A590 south to cross the motorway and the A65 towards Settle and Skipton. I suddenly remembered a fantastic chippy in Wetherby so I took the A59 to Harrogate and called in for my fish and chip supper at 9.30pm. My entertainment for this journey was Radio 4 and the Party Leaders Debate, maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it interesting. In fact it may be the only political programme I listen to before the election because I have already heard enough spin to last me a life time. At 11pm I was home, tired but happy. My short walk for today came in at 13.05 miles, making a grand total of 46.40 miles over the four days. Would I do it all again? You bet I would, ha ha. I called in at Poundstretcher today just to see if they had any reduced price food. Didn't bother to look round the shop, didn't need anything else. In the past I have found out of date stuff which has been dead cheap. They had a few items in a basket. Packs of four tins of Branston spaghetti reduced from 99p to 49p, so I bought the four packs which were there. Sixteen tins of spaghetti for \u00a31.96, and only just out of date. Then I had a nosey on the biscuit shelves checking the sell by dates, and found some flapjacks dated 31st March. There was eight bars at 39p each. I took them to the checkout and said if you reduce these I will buy them. He said 19p each, I said done.The moral of this story is check the dates in case the staff have missed some, and if you find any out of date ask them to reduce the price for you. If you don't ask you dont get. It pays to be vigilant and not miss an opportunity. I also noticed that the checkout lad gave me a foreign coin instead of a penny. I gave it him back."}, {"title": "In the Lakes, day 1 & 2", "date": "Friday 16 April 2010", "text": "What an amazing four days I've had in The Lakes, I stayed at Patterdale Youth Hostel near to Ulleswater. I had a steady drive there on Monday, after taking two dogs for a walk before I left. With the price of fuel at the moment I didn't go more that 60 mph, preferring to trundle along at 55mph with the lorries, much better fuel consumption. The hostel cost me \u00a347.85 for three nights self catering, so I took my coolbox with enough supplies to last.I arrived about at about 3pm and had a walkabout to check out the area and to find the meeting place where I was to meet up with the walking forum members the following morning. I was immediately in awe of the scale of the mountains, they seemed to be towering up in every direction, hard to imagine what it would be like on the top looking down. I was soon to find out.It was a gloriously sunny day and I had my shorts and teeshirt on. This is a couple of views of Glenridding looking across Ullswater. It is a very popular area for campers and walkers because there is direct access to Helvellyn, where I am going tomorrow. Patterdale is just 20mins walk away so I could leave my car there for the four days.Click on the photo's to make them bigger, then click again to make them giganticIf you look across to the other side of the water, that's where I walked on the Wednesday, more of that later.You meet all kinds of people in a hostel, that's what I like about them. You can be on your own all day and there is someone to talk to at night. My first night in the ten bedded room and there was only three of us in it, so we all had our little corner to disappear into. After my makeshift dinner, something simple I don't spend ages faffing about as you know, I sat in the lounge reading magazines. I was having trouble staying awake to be honest. Two couples sat in the corner chatting, one of the women came over to me and said they would like to sing and hoped it wouldn't disturb me. She asked if I would like to come over and join them. I told her to carry on, but declined their invitation. For the next hour I was treated to 'Uncle Tom Cobbly and All', over and over again, with great in depth discussions about the words and their meanings. I lost the will to live and went to bed, ha ha.Next morning I was up early becoming increasingly excited about my day on the mountain. What would I need to take, will it be warm or cool? I was rather hoping the weather would be kind to us so optimistically I didn't take great bundles of clothes. In the first few photo's you can see why I wish I had.I met up with seven guys from the forum :0) Hey, I was the only woman, and they were all younger than me, can't get much better than that. As you can see there was a lot of mist and fog and wind, which hung around for a good part of the day. There were some clear patches where we had to whip out the cameras pretty sharpishly to take a few snaps, before it was all lost in the swirling mist.Half the time I didn't know where we were, but I had a feeling we were on Striding Edge, that was one of the most difficult routes across to Helvellyn, but the mist was all around us so thankfully I couldn't see the bottom. If you imagine a letter 'V' upside down, /\\ like that, with a scramble up massive rocks at the beginning, and a scary scramble down at the other end. It was probably just as well I couldn't see the bottom.You would think people had better things to do, but no, when we got to the top of Helvellyn it was like a mororway service area, and Striding Edge was the M1. Amazing how many people were there, all very jolly of course. Me eating my sandwich.Yes, that's my feet in the snow, it was freezing cold, one of our group kindly lent me a pair of gloves because I hadn't taken any, I didn't think I would need them.Hey, wait for me guys . . . . .Aha, the sun has tried to make a break for it, this weather is so unpredictable. A few moments to whip out the camera and capture a nice view before it disappears again. This lake is called Red Tarn, on one side is Striding Edge and the other Swirral Edge, we went all the way round it.If you look very closely at the photo below you can just about make out three or four dots walking along the path at the bottom, they are a long way down from here.This is Swirral Edge, I think ;o)We have completed the circle and this is Red Tarn from another angle. The thing about walking up high is that the scenery changes every few steps, you have to keep getting your camera outI'm not sure where I am on this photo, we went up and down that many times. I think the guys wanted to get in as many peaks as they could, and I was happy to follow. In fact I felt like I was being dragged a few times, but that is exactly what I wanted. I like to push myself that bit further, out of my comfort zone. If you carry on doing the same things day in day out, month after month, life can get a bit boring.Off we go again, I'll follow you.Here are the team, two of them split earlier, for a different route.We're on our way back now, my legs were beginning to buckle a little bit under me. The pain in the muscles in my upper legs was agony, especially on the downhills. I have never done so much climbing in one day before. No point in moaning though, just get on with the job.When these are the views you are rewarded with it is worth every step.There's only one way to experience the height and that is to be there, the photo's don't do it justice. When you look down you wonder how on earth you are going to get back down to ground level, it seems such a steep drop. But the hills are covered in paths that you cant see untill you are up there. There is a way down from here.Only one thing left to do, a pint in the pub, boy was I gasping for that! I am a happy bunny, and the verdict is that we have walked, or should I say scrambled, stumbled, slithered on bums, nearly fifteen miles in ten hours. Now what will my legs be like tomorrow, because I want to do it all again, on another route. My poor legs have never done so much work, I am struggling to get up and down stairs. I have climbed several mountains. Each day I thought crikey that was hard work, then the next morning I got up and did it all over again. Four days in the Lake District, I'm off to bed now, will sort out the pics tomorrow."}, {"title": "I'm gonna climb a mountain", "date": "Sunday 11 April 2010", "text": "To follow on from the last post of building a mountain, I shall be climbing a mountain on Tuesday. I'm off to the Lake District to meet up with a few others from http://www.walkingforum.co.uk/ and we are going up Helvellyn, the third highest mountain in England. Whooopeeee, I'm so excited. While I am there I thought I might as well do some walks myself as well. It looks pretty interesting on the map, lots of hills, and I might have a trip on a boat, that's if they are working. So, I'll catch up with you later, lots of pics to post when I get back.I wont keep you in suspenders any longer, you may be wondering what the heck has happened to this piece of foam. . . . . . . Well, I am building a mountain. Inspired by my walking, this is my interpretation of the great outdoors. I started by roughly cutting a piece of any old fabric, this happens to be an old teeshirt that someone gave me. I then tacked in some seams to make it roughly fit the foam mould. I started at the bottom adding pieces of randomly cut fabric, using any stitches in any colour of embroidery thread. At this stage I had no set plan. I knitted small pieces and added them, I cut up any fabric into any shapes, pinned it on and stitched around the edge, frayed edges are fine it doesn't have to look too perfect. So, imagine standing at the bottom of the mountain looking up. The black snakey thing is the footpath cut from black vinyl, the green stitches is the grass growing between the stone slabs. I think I may have to do a little more work on the footpath because it looks a bit lost amongst the other colours. The beads represent piles of stones.The green tufts are the ends cut off the plastic fatball bags that you hang up for the birds, and the flowers I cut from coloured vinyl. Now I am beginning to make a sculpture.There is still a lot more work to do on it. I am going to add more features to it, maybe a couple of climbers, some sheep, and it will have snow on the top. I also want to add a waterfall, hedges, and a stile or two. Then I am going to add more at the base, to take it further out, and possibly add another mountain. There is no limit, it could grow and grow to be a whole range of mountains. I will go wherever it takes me, just like my feet following a map, only this map is in my head."}, {"title": "Full to bursting", "date": "Saturday 10 April 2010", "text": "It's been a lovely day today, hence my spring picture above. I am not able to go far this weekend as I am looking after Ben dog untill Monday. This morning we were picking up litter around the village. Ben is getting on in years and his back legs are becoming weakened, a common problem I think in dogs of this breed, he is Collie/German Shepherd cross. He can only walk very slowly, and not very far. It is so sad to see him struggle, we can only make his life comfortable from now on.This afternoon we were in the garden. A lot of my plants had outgrown their pots so needed potting on. Ben was snoozing in the sun. Tonight's dinner was an invention. My food stocks are very low as I am running everything down before I go shopping again. So, I chopped half a butternut squash and an onion into small pieces, and fried them in olive oil. Then I added a squidgen of tomato puree, teaspoon of turmeric, dash of lemon juice, spices that are three years out of date, some apple juice, and added some sauce I made with a packet of beef stroganoff mix. Into a pan of boiling water I put any odd bits of pasta and spaghetti I had. The finished meal........My goodness I am full to bursting, and it was lovely."}, {"title": "A sad state of affairs", "date": "Friday 9 April 2010", "text": "This is an observation, it's not a criticism, and not aimed at anyone in particular, just something I have noticed. These photographs which I took yesterday in town, make me very sad. There are ten barriers in total which have been installed in strategic places at a busy crossroads in the town, which is a magnate to teenagers hell bent on rendering themselves totally legless and out of their skull. The area has several bars close together, and on Friday and Saturday nights it has been a no go area for quite some time now for people not wishing to partake of this activity.The police and ambulance services are in attendance to pick up the bodies and hopefully make sure that no lives are lost. But what a sad state of affairs. The reason for the barriers across the roads are to prevent vehicles entering the area and accidently knocking the intoxicated teenagers over, whilst they stagger from pub to pub. You might say it is health and safety gone mad, but I suppose it is better that people have to divert from their normal route rather than a young life be snuffed out.Young people drinking has always happened, it's nothing new, I did it when I was a teenager. But never to the extent that I didn't know where I was. I always went home while my legs could still carry me. How sad that now they are picked up off the street, taken to a hospital, cleaned up, and escorted home, and that's if they are lucky. Some may even find themselves lying face down in a back alley having been beaten up and raped. Truly shocking. How sad that the only way to control the situation is to put up these barriers. In a way the message they give out is, 'you go ahead and drink yourself into oblivion, we'll keep you all in one enclosure, watch over you, and take you home when you are ready.' Responsibility for your own actions is a hard lesson to learn. You drink a little, fine, you can handle it, most can but some can't. They don't know when to stop. I am not talking about alchoholism here, but social drinking that has got out of hand. Walk down any street when it is collection day for recycling glass and tins. I am shocked at how high the boxes are piled up with beer and lager cans, and wine and spirit bottles. It seems like every day is party time. I listen to people who think it's fun to have a few drinks, not just once or twice a week but every single night. I think it's sad that people feel they need to drink to enjoy life. The harm they are doing to their internal organs does not enter their head, it's only later on in life when their bodies can no longer function properly, that they begin to wonder if they might have overdone it a bit. It is possible that some people will never connect their ill health to the amount of alcohol they have consumed, instead looking for other reasons why they are so tired and have digestive problems. Oh dear, this all sounds a bit preachy, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be. I just feel sad that some people don't think about the choices they have in life. Ok teenagers might be at the experimental stage, and hopefully they will grow out of it, but some will carry on the downward spiral into an early grave, that's not only sad but tragic. My father's premature death was caused by excess drinking and smoking, he dropped dead of a heart attack at the age of 46. Thank God I have not inherited that gene from him. The thing is that none of us know when our time is up, but I am sure as hell not going to do anything that might accelerate my demise. I am having too much of a good time, with an ocassional bottle of wine once a month."}, {"title": "Gourmet cook? Probably not!", "date": "Wednesday 7 April 2010", "text": "I thought I might take a leaf out of Frugal Queen's book and concoct some tasty morsels for my lunch. So here we are with a tin of borlotti beans, all the gunge rinsed off under the tap, cost 44p. Add a splash of toasted linseed oil, teaspoon of turmeric, lemon juice, black pepper, sprinkling of herbs and spices. Take a fork and mash it all up. Finely chop an onion and a handfull of spinach, and add these to the mix. Take a desertspoonfull and mould it into a flattened ball. Four of these will use half the mix. Put them on a piece of foil on a grill pan, and grill them till they are golden brown, flipping once. Serve them on a bed of spinach.  Don't they look delicious, yummy.Now for the truth. Difficult to get the mix to stick together, they fell apart under the grill, and broke up when flipped. They went all dry and had no taste, like eating cardboard, ha ha. But I still ate them because I don't throw food away. The other half of the mix is in the fridge, I will use it as a sandwich filler as it tastes quite nice raw ;o)"}, {"title": "The plan unfolds", "date": "Tuesday 6 April 2010", "text": "I've had such a lot of fun today, and I haven't even been anywhere. I surrounded myself with maps and guide books, the computer has been purring away while I've been flicking backwards and forwards from one web site to another, checking and double checking. My map of the south coast from Dorset to Cornwall now has a series of dots stretching from Lulworth Cove to Lands End.No, don't get excited, I am not going to walk all that way, a ramble of that magnitude would take about two months and I can't spare the time. But I will be exploring lots of interesting places in my car, staying at Youth Hostels along the way.So, it's all booked and ready to go, only a few weeks to wait and my holiday begins, I'm so excited. The first hostel is Salisbury, then Lulworth Cove, Salcombe, Perranporth, and Lands End. Then I fly to the Isles of Scilly on the Airbus, it only takes 20 minutes. I have four days there, staying at a guest house.I have been watching the television series, An Island Parish, all about the Scilly Isles, and made my mind up to go and see it for myself. When I spoke to the lady who owns the guest house this afternoon she tells me she is a friend of Heike the vet, and she will introduce me to her. I am chuffed to bits as Heike is a smashing lady, it's going to be so thrilling.Ok, I know it's going to cost a bit of money, quite a lot actually, but this is why I am frugal in other ways. I don't smoke, rarely drink, don't eat out, don't go to pubs, and don't put the heating on. I save a few pennies wherever I can, so this is payback time. I shall be self catering at the hostels so that will keep keep the cost down a bit. I shall be doing a lot of exploring with my feet, and visiting places which cost very little or nothing to get in. I'll take my bicycle with me, and might get to use my bus pass. I will check if I can exchange my Tesco vouchers for admission tickets, might visit the Eden Project again. And of course there is lots of free fresh sea air. Can't wait :o)"}, {"title": "Eye catching necklace", "date": "Monday 5 April 2010", "text": "It's been a blustery old day today so I've been doing a bit of crafting. Remember the red velvet necklace I made, here is the picture to remind you.I have made another one, same idea but a different design. This idea suddenly came into my head. Here are the materials I used. Twentysix small glass marbles, some brown knitting wool that looks like eyelashes, and some fabric cut from a dress I bought for 50p. If you want to have a go at making it this is how to do it. Make a long narrow sausage from the fabric, just wide enough to slide the marbles inside. Sew it together inside out then turn it the right way round. You need to make it as long as you want the necklace plus extra to tie it at the back.Push the first marble inside to the centre, then take two pieces of wool about six inches long, you can use any wool, and wrap them round the fabric so you trap the marble. Tie it tight, then take a needle and thread the same colour as the wool, and put a few stitches through it so it doesn't come loose. Keep on adding the marbles, and seperate them with the wool, untill your necklace is long enough. I have 30 in the red one, and 26 in this one. If you don't have marbles you could use any small beads. You finish off the ends by tucking them inside and securing with a few stitches. Then you have your necklace. I am really pleased with this one, though the photo's don't do it justice.All I need to do now is find somewhere nice to go so I can wear it."}, {"title": "A right good natter", "date": "Sunday 4 April 2010", "text": "I went back home today, by home I mean my home town of Burton upon trent, a visit to my relatives was well overdue. I don't go that often, maybe two or three times a year, everything has changed so much since I left thirteen years ago. The house where I used to live is on a main road, and now it has a McDonalds opposite, it is so busy with traffic now, thank goodness I moved out.My first port of call was to see Uncle Stan, he is coming up to his 87th birthday in June, and is still as busy as ever with his painting, hairdressing, and gardening. He has been busy painting pictures for an exhibition in the library starting on Tuesday for two weeks. All the money from the sale will go to the Air Ambulance, a charity Stan has supported for several years. He was in the local newspaper recentlywww.burtonmail.co.uk/News/Blind-artist-has-a-fund-raising-vision.htmI was invited for lunch, and Pat his wife prepared a lovely spread, vegetarian lasagne, steamed vegetables, roast potatoes, and bread and butter pudding with cream. I was well stuffed.After that I knew Stan would doze in his arm chair so I went to meet my sister and her husband in their local for a drink, then back to their house where she showed me some photo's of her new granddaughter.Then I went back to pick Stan up and we went to see my Aunty Lyn, Stan's sister. Neither of them are able to drive any more because of sight problems, so while I am visiting in the car it is a good opportunity to get them together for a natter. And boy did they natter, we left at 7.15pm, I dropped Stan off, and drove the 95 miles home arriving at 10pm.So there you are, visit three relatives all on the same day, and everyone is happy. Now I can relax with a glass of wine."}, {"title": "Direct debits make you blind", "date": "Saturday 3 April 2010", "text": "I had a letter today, in fact it says it is a special letter, wow, I am privileged. It says, 'Don't miss your EARLY BIRD savings,' now that's a word I am interested in. Savings, what can I save, and what do I have to do to make a saving? I read on.My Early Bird reminder comes from Saga magazine, offering a wonderful opportunity to save mega pounds off my next subscription. You may remember I was given my current subscription as a Christmas present from my uncle, and going by the date on the letter, we are only three months into it. Never the less they are keen, or should I say desperate, to keep my custom so have come up with this amazing offer.The letter continues, 'It may seem a little early to be thinking about renewing, but if you choose to do so now, well ahead of time, you can secure a further 12 issues for \u00a35.95. That gives you a fabulous discount of \u00a324.05 off the full subscription price.' What is even better is that you don't have to pay anything untill your current subscription runs out.'This isn't the first time they have written to me offering a cheap subscription, it looks to me like they are falling over themselves to get people to sign up. Of course to take up an offer you have to commit to direct debit payments, this is a sure fire way to extract money from people without them even noticing it. In eight months time when the direct debit is due to kick in, they hope most people will have forgotten they ever agreed to it, and won't even notice the money disappearing from their bank account.It is possible that a great proportion of the British public, or even the world wide public, have no idea how many direct debits go out of their accounts each month, or even what they are paying for. Oh yes, the letters may arrive year after year informing of the new subscription about to start, but how many people read them? A quick glance at the company name on the top, oh is it that time again already! Haven't got time to deal with it now, I'll sort it next year. And so it goes on, and on, and on.That's why big businesses favour direct debits, they spin their web around you, extracting your bank details, and squeeze so tight that you can't get away, the temptation is just too strong. They prey on people's weaknesses, and their vulnerability. Their sales literature is so worded that you think they are doing you a favour by offering these fantastic deals. Well this old gal can't be won over.When my current Saga subscription stops at the end of the year, I shall start at the beginning and read them all again, because by that time I will have forgotten what was in them. I did the same with Gardeners World, one year of growing veg is much the same as another. Mind you, I am looking for a good home for twelve copies of Psychologies magazine, it was pretty boring and didn't tell me much more than I already know, so I won't be reading those again.

I did speak to the man at the fair, and he did say they were looking for drivers, but the rest was my little fantasy. Ah well, it's nice to dream, back to reality.This isn't fantasy though, it's true, I walked 20 miles today, yipeee. You do believe me don't you ;0) I wanted to beat last weeks walk of 18 miles, so I worked the route out first and checked the distance before I started out. I set off at 10.15, behind the church then along the hills above the River Trent. I decided to stay local for this walk. The footbridge here used to be wooden, but the youths kept chopping it up and making bonfires with it. So now it has been replaced with a new aluminium one. They also had to replace all the wooden sign posts as well, for the same reason. I never tire of this view even though I have seen it many times before.  A bit further along I came to lots of parked vehicles, vans and cars with trailers, then I realised what they were doing. The local scrambling club were out in force, there must have been about fifty of them. The noise of reving engines is not something I want to hear in the countryside, so I quickly marched on and left them behind. As you come into Alkborough there is a good view of the flood plains. The plaque on the plinth shows a map of all the places you can see from this viewpoint. Alkborough Church is well cared for, with immaculately cut lawns.Pressing on, I only stopped for short food and drink breaks. The weather was ok, sunny with a few clouds. I passed through Whitton and arrived at Winteringham Haven at the Humberside Yacht Club. Everyone looked busy getting their boats ready for sailing.The footpaths are very well maintained in this quiet corner of North Lincolnshire, but they do tend to plough over those that pass through the middle of a field. Here the farmer has kindly marked the way with two sticks. Sometimes it seems natural to follow the tractor marks across but this doesn't always apply when the path goes diagonally from one corner to another.This one seems pretty clear which way to go, but half way across the path veers off to the right, away from the tracks. You need to look for the sign post or a stile in the distance to give you some idea of the direction.Here the farmer has planted the whole field up, then put the marker sticks in, and flattened the plants where the path should be. Seems a bit sad to destroy plants that are already growing. I had to put my waterproofs on before I got back as the weather turned very windy and wet. I arrived back home at 6.15pm, it really shouldn't have taken that long, but it was my fault, I will stop and chat to people. Never mind, the main purpose was to do the distance, it wasn't a race.

I took my car in for a service this morning and as I walked across the road to spend some time in the library while I waited for it, I saw that the fair has come to town. Now fairground people favour old British lorries for their workhorses rather than the posher foreign types. There are still a lot of Foden's and ERF's about even though they haven't built any new ones for years in this country. The old ones just refuse to give up, and with a lot of love and attention they will give many years of service, going round the clock several times.Lucky I had my camera with me as I found these three beauties. I've had many a love affair with an ERF. I remember driving one just like this, for British Road Services on the Crompton Cable contract. It was a beast, twin splitter gear box, couldn't find the gears, like stirring a rice pudding, I played some lovely tunes on it. Brings back memories. I was positively drooling when a guy who was hitching up his trailer came over to speak to me. Well, I'm in my element when I find someone who talks trucks. I was rabbiting on about all the jobs I had done with ERF's, Leicester Heavy Haulage being my favourite. Lo and behold, he comes from Leicester. I mentioned that I had recently reached retirement age, and I was beginning to miss the life on the road. How I would love to get back into a cab again.  A broad smile crept across his face, 'We need some drivers', he said. I couldn't believe my ears, I said, 'What, really.' The next thing, I was sitting in his posh living trailer, with his wife making us a cup of tea, and talking about what the job entailed. He explained that I wouldn't have to do any of the heavy manual work of erecting and dismantling the rides, but I would have to work on the rides when the fair was open. Taking money in the pay booths, or collecting money from the punters when they are already sitting in their seats.  He said I would have to have a trial on the Waltzers to see how my balance was on a moving platform, as it could be a bit tricky to start with. They usually find lots of coins underneath the ride after it has been taken down due to the attendant stumbling and missing his pocket. They even had one guy knocked off his feet by one of the cars because he wasn't paying attention. I told him I have a very good sense of balance because I am a very good ice skater, he seemed to like that.  Anyway, I have got to go back tonight for a trial run. The man, Jim, said come at 7 o clock, then we can see how you cope in the dark as well, and you can meet the rest of the gang. He said if you are happy with it you can come for six months. It seems a tight schedule, with a fair few miles between the bookings.   Wow, this is all a bit quick, I'd better get onto Sue to take my cats for me. Then I'll have to get some steel toecap boots. Not sure where I am going to live, he did say they had a small trailer for me. I'll let you know how I get on at the trial ;0)"}, {"title": "No news is good news", "date": "Wednesday 31 March 2010", "text": "I think I'm going to have to stop listening to the news on the radio, I can't stand all the bickering that is going on between the political parties. I suppose it is only to be expected in the run up to an election, and it is going to get a whole lot worse the closer we get to it.I used to be quite interested in politics, especially when it concerns matters that might affect me and my life, but these days the politicians just want to score points off each other rather than run the country. Some of the interviews end up as slanging matches, I get so annoyed I just want to bang their heads together.What really makes me blow a gasket is to listen to them discussing the financial deficit, and how they are going to get us out of this mess. It sounds to me like the UK is bankrupt, but that's hardly surprising, their business acumen is appalling. They pay people who have no intention of looking for work, they pay women to have lots of kids, they let anyone into the country and give them anything they want, and they prop up businesses that are about to collapse, then allow the directors to carry on paying themselves massive bonuses.And then they have the gall to say there is not enough money to look after our older generation, and they want us all to pay into an insurance so we can have care in the home. Excuse me Government, what happened to all the income tax and national insurance contributions I have paid for the last fortyfive years? Mr Brown, what have you done with my money? I didn't have a choice, you took it from my wages. I thought that was my insurance, that it was going to be used to look after me. And now you want more, because you have squandered all the money I have already given you.I'm going to have to stop listening to the news.I've done my litter picking stint this morning, in between the showers. The village is starting to look ship shape and Bristol fashion now, no idea where that saying comes from, or what Bristol has got to do with keeping things tidy, ha ha. It's surprising how many people are speaking to me as I go around with my plastic bag and pickstick, everyone says hello, or good morning, or makes some light hearted comment about the weather. I seem to have aquired lots of new aquaintances. People even shout and wave to me from across the street. I was worried that people might think I was bonkers, but it has not happened I am pleased to say.I started some small talk with a woman waiting at the bus stop, as I picked a sweet wrapper up from near her left foot. She asked why I was doing the job. I thought that was a strange question. I muttered something about the kids buying sweets from the shop and discarding the wrappers as they walk along. She immediately replied, 'It's not kids from round here that are doing it'. I said, 'I don't care where the kids come from, I am fed up of seeing it lying around so I am doing something about it.'I see we are entered in the Best Kept Village competition, there is a poster on the notice board outside the Post Office. I will try and find out when the judges are expected to come and look round the place, then I can put a bit of extra effort into it the week before. It would be nice if we could win, we have been very close in past years.Talking of rubbish, we have just had the new Thompson Local Directory delivered. I can't see the point in this publication when we have two perfectly acceptable directories called Yellow Pages and The Phone Book, both from BT. Why do we need another one? Well I don't want it cluttering my office up, it is going straight into the recycle bin, along with all the other junk mail.I'm off out now to take Ben dog a walk. You can bet your life that if I don't take my pickstick I am bound to see some litter lurking, so I had better take it, just in case. We shall go a walk up to the smallholding so I can get some free range eggs, I have run out.

However I was not pleased to discover that my usual Tesco fruit yogurt had gone up a massive 20p, from \u00a31 for a pack of six, to \u00a31.20. What a cheek! I wonder why it has leapt up so much, is the fruit in short supply, or has half the country's cows dropped down dead?I decided to leave them on the shelf and think of something else I could have as a treat that doesn't cost as much. I noticed they had a special offer of 70p on the 500g size of Low Fat Natural Yogurt, so I bought one.When I got home, I opened a tin of Morrisons own brand peaches in light syrup, and was impressed that the tin was packed full of fruit, not half full of juice like you would expect of a cheap 24p tin. I chopped the peaches and put some in a dish and covered it with the yogurt. It's lovely.So for 94p I have got a lot more fruit yogurt than I would have had out of six little pots, and it keeps for almost two weeks in the fridge. The moral is, if you find prices have gone up more than you are willing to pay, look for something cheaper that is just as good.

Ten of us met up yesterday morning at the church in Youlgreave, a village in the Derbyshire Peak District. The weather was mainly sunny with a light breeze.It made a nice change not to have to find my own way, although I still carried a map because I like to keep a record of where I have been. Forgive me if this post is lacking in detail, but I rather let my concentration slip a bit as I was enjoying the company and looked on it more as a day off.There are quite a lot of unusual shaped rocks in this area.Everyone rushes to be the first one to the top. Lovely views from the top of this pile of rocks.This is the entrance to Hermits Cave, it was believed to have been inhabited around the 12th century, it's occupant carving a Christ image into the rock. Tall rocks hidden behind the trees.These lamas live at Barn Farm, a holiday complex for campers and caravaners.Boys will be boys. Radder and Joe are standing on a funny shaped rock called the Cork Stone. It is a tall stone which has been shaped naturally by the weather.One of the many stunning views looking down from Stanton Moor.Here's one for us, girls. Now you know why I like walking. When you get eye candy like Radder, it's worth going, believe me he is a hunk :0)Some of the boys like climbing, and here they are looking up at The Earl Grey Memorial Tower. Shall we give it a try? This memorial was built in 1832 to mark Earl Greys electoral reform bill that gave every man the right to vote.The legend of the Nine Ladies Circle says that it was formed when nine witches were turned to stone when dancing to the music of the fiddle. Thank you to Joe for giving us printed information on these landmarks. Nearing the end of the walk it was time for a group photo session.And finally a pretty little cottage next to the River Lathkill in Alport. It looks a lovely place to live, but I'm not sure I could stand the noise of the water rushing past my front door every minute of every day.This morning was a bit disappointing. After staying overnight in Hathersage Youth Hostel, I was looking forward to another day of getting high, onto the moors that is, ha ha. A drizzly misty start, and the weather forecast said it would be the same all day. Oh well, better make the most of it while I am here. I checked out of the hostel and set off. Not too bad, just a bit damp.It got worse, the mist came down covering the tops. I did manage a couple of climbs. When I say climb, I don't mean with ropes, they are just very steep hills, I am not into mountaineering. These boulders were huge at the top of this peak.After a couple of hours the rain was coming down heavier and I was getting fed up of plodding through mud, so I headed back to the car. I came across this strange ruin in the middle of a wood. Not sure what it might have been, but I thought it looked interesting.I think I'll stay at home for a few days now. We've got Easter coming up, I don't like going anywhere on a bank holiday, too much traffic, too many people."}, {"title": "Back in a bit", "date": "Monday 29 March 2010", "text": "Have you missed me, sorry about disappearing again.

I decided that to walk further I needed to choose an area closer to home, so I drove 23 miles to the Lincolnshire Wolds. The hills may not be of the same greatness as Yorkshire or Derbyshire, and may not require the same level of physical fitness, but the views are still impressive, and the solitude of walking in a less busy area gives one the sense of being at peace with nature.I set off from Nettleton , a village a mile and a half south of the market town of Caistor. The time on the clock church is 10.30am.My route for a good part of this walk was the Viking Way. I have walked the northern parts of this long distance path around Barton upon Humber before, so I wanted to see how it develops further down. The only problem I can see with walking the Lincolnshire Wolds is the lack of footpaths. Not a problem with shorter walks, but to do a longer circular walk, without doing a lot of road walking means going a bit out of your way to get back to the start. Which is what happened to me.I came over the brow of a hill and came across this beastie chewing the cud. Not knowing if it was a he or a she, I kept my eyes on it as I gave it a wide berth. It glanced at me and carried on chewing. On closer inspection I decided I was safe, it looked as if it was ready for the knackers yard and wouldn't have the energy to haul itself onto it's feet. Phew, I'm always cautious where cows are concerned.In fact I came across a lot of cows, didn't always have to walk through them but they add a bit of interest to the photo's. I think we should all stop eating them and just keep a few as decoration, but that's another subject for another time.Gentle rolling hills were the order of the day.On the map it said disused pit, I came across several of these tunnel entrances which have been bricked up. It looks as though they went into the hillside and came out at the quarry at the other end. Probably a way of transporting the chalk away from the area.I was lucky with the weather, blue skies and fluffy clouds for most of the day, with the ocassional dark cloud passing by.I spotted this golf ball from a distance,and made a short detour to get a close up picture. It's a Radar Station.I passed through the pretty little village of Normanby le Wold, and came to Walesby. The church is worth a good luck round here, as it is called The Ramblers Church. It sits high on a hill outside of the village, and is lovingly cared for by local volunteers.A notice on the board says they had some lead stolen from the roof, and it has now been replaced with a substitute material which has no value at all, and is security marked. We have had that same problem, as I suspect a lot of churches have, twice our lead has been stolen. It is now going to be repaired with stainless steel.This is the view from the church looking out over the Wolds. The wooden bench gives walkers a welcome rest place. Looking across the horizon I can see Lincoln Cathedral, a good 25 - 30 miles away.As I left the church I looked back to take this photo.A lot of the footpaths were well defined bridleways and easy to follow. If you look on the horizon of this photo you can see where I entered the bridleway from the road, the path followed the gentle curves along the edges of the fields. I left the Viking Way at Tealby, it was about time to set off back. I went through Tealby, Stainton le Vale, skirted round the edge of Thoresway, and arrived in Rothwell to see this babbling stream.All the villages have their own individual signs, this one stands proudly on the roadside close to the pub. It's a shame that I am too early for the daffodils that are about to come into bloom at any time.I arrived back at my car at 6.55pm, just in time for the Archers.

I like the newness of maps. When I open one I imagine a journey of discovery, like I am the only person who has ever been there. I gently tease out the folds, taking care not to tear the paper. Then I spread them out on the floor and search for interesting places to visit, lakes, rivers, hills, mountains, forests, woods, railways, nature reserves, castles, churches, they are all there on the map, so much to see.

No longer is there a counter with welcoming ladies ready to assist with the returning and borrowing of books, now we have a robot, which apparently can do the job just as well, without the smile and chit chat of course.I was in the library today and chose three books, pressed the 'borrow books' button on the screen, and inserted my card underneath the scanner, bar code uppermost. The message came up, 'error, seek assistance from a member of staff'. I looked round, where was the member of staff, now they have all been dispensed with. I spotted her sitting at a little table in the corner, tapping away on a keyboard. She put my details into her computer, and handed the card back to me. She said, 'That's ok now, you've been updated for another three years'.The nice smiley chatty member of staff approached the robot to show me how it works. Scan the card, put the books onto the shelf below the screen, press 'print ticket', and there you go, job done. It even knows how many books, and their titles, I have out already. Apparently if you put 20 books on the shelf it will read twenty titles, and list them all on the ticket. Amazing. All very well when the system is working, but what happens when it crashes, will they go back to the old fashioned way of rubberstamping the date inside the cover?I don't like all this automating things. I remember when I was at the Job Centre (Labour Exchange) searching for a job by pressing buttons on a screen, then printing a ticket out. The one I really hate is the serve yourself checkouts at the supermarket, what a pain that is. Whizz an item over the scanner six or seven times, and it still won't blasted well scan. I gave up with that one and would rather wait for a real person to serve me.I can cope with the hole in the wall to withdraw cash, but I still like paying my bills the old fashioned way by writing a cheque. They say it won't be long before cheques will be phased out, I think we should all be fighting against that happening, and writing as many cheques as we can to let the powers that be know we want to keep them. Don't suppose it would make any difference though, we are all doomed to a world run by robots.

I thought I had used up all of the gazebo roof which I pulled out of a skip, but I found one last piece in my garage. A good scrub up with soapy water on the table in the garden, and it has come up like new.The size is 13\" tall, 11\" wide, and 7\" deep. I cut the cat shapes out of the vinyl from the Scrapstore and stitched them on by hand. I did try machining them on but it wouldn't feed the fabric through smoothly and the stitches kept getting smaller. I used blue embroidery thread to match the bag so it looks acceptable, in fact it gives it a home made look. Can't wait to give it to her, I am as excited about it as she hopefully will be."}, {"title": "She's a good sport", "date": "Sunday 21 March 2010", "text": "Hasn't it been a lovely day today. I went another walk this morning, no not my usual hike, this time it really was a stroll in the park. My friend Irene did a three mile sponsored walk for Sports Relief, along the roads surrounding Central Park. I went to keep her company. There was the usual razamataz at the beginning, the warm up session that had us hopping about and clapping our hands, the colourfull fancy dress outfits, and the pop music blaring out. It was nice to see a lot of families with small children taking part, groups of teenage girls enjoying themselves, and a few serious runners who were quick off the mark. This is Irene. It didn't seem to take us long to complete the circuit, even though we were last in the three mile event, mind you we were nattering all the way. I think Irene did extremely well considering it wasn't that long ago that she had an operation, and she also has a few back problems. As far as I could see, Irene was probably the oldest person to take part, and I was probably the second oldest, ha ha.When we got to the finishing line Irene was given her goody bag and a medal, then I was handed one as well. I said I wasn't taking part, but they insisted I had one because I did the walk. So we both have a medal. I think Irene might get hooked on this walking lark, maybe I have found a walking buddy.I called in Tesco on the way home and found a few bargains. I spent \u00a34.45 on reduced price, bread, crumpets, hot cross buns, mushrooms, potatoes, and cauliflower. That is all I need, I still have lots left from my big shop last week.I did a bit of work in the garden this afternoon. Normally at this time of year I have got my seeds in trays on the window sill, but I haven't done anything yet. I will have to pull my finger out or I will have no veg to eat in the summer. I am going to keep it simple this year, only grow stuff that doesn't need pampering, I will get it started then it will have to look after itself.I found some seed potatoes for \u00a31 a bag at Poundland. They were well chitted so I put them straight into the raised beds. I have sown runner beans, tomatoes, and cucumber seeds, in plastic drinks cups. I didn't buy any new compost, but used the old compost from last year out of the raised beds. I don't know if the seeds will germinate, we shall see.I've still got some sprouts left to eat from last year, as soon as they have gone I can use the bed again for something else. I am not going to do brassicas again, it is just too much trouble to keep them covered. You get them going in the spring, the butterflies somehow manage to get under the net curtains and lay their eggs, and the slugs attack them from the bottom. I just can't be bothered.I will just grow the things that I know will do well, like the courgettes, cucumber, salad leaves, runner beans, a few tomatoes, carrots, and of course spuds. They will have to look after themselves while I go gallivanting about."}, {"title": "Martha Elizabeth Helen", "date": "Saturday 20 March 2010", "text": "March is always a sad month for me. The 4th was my mothers birthday, she was born in 1918, and the 20th of March 1982 is the day my dear mother died. She was 64 years old and suffered a fatal heart attack. It was such a shock to us, my brother and sister and me. When I was young she told me stories of her life in Hamburg. She had a comfortable life as a child, her teenage years were happy years, and in her early twenties she married and had a son, she called him Ingo. Her husband was unfaithfull and in those days that meant divorce.Then came the war and she found herself homeless with a little boy in a pram, most of Hamburg had been flattened. She met my father who was a serving soldier, and came to England to marry him. There was pressure from family members to leave her son with his father to be brought up in the country of his birth, his father had remarried. This must have been a heart breaking decision to make, but as she did not know what she would find in England she thought it best to go along with their wishes. One can only imagine how distraught she might have been, Ingo was four years old. Mum then had four more children, the last one being a premature baby boy that did not survive. Alas her second marriage was unhappy, she did not get the support she needed from my father, and it ended in divorce. In the beginning there were letters, and photographs of Ingo, arriving from Germany, but they eventually became less frequent and stopped altogether. Her life revolved round us, her three children born here. Although she had very little money, she went without herself so that we were clothed and fed. She had such a hard life, she was a hard working woman who did her very best for us. In 1981 mum received a telegram from her brother Henry in Hamburg, he had received a phone call from Ingo, asking about his birth mother. He was now 37 and wanted to contact her. Next came a letter from Ingo and over the next few months letters and phone calls passed between mother and son. A date was set for mum to travel to Germany to meet Ingo, I was to put her on the boat at Harwich, and Ingo was to meet her at Hamburg. She wasn't able to make the journey, she had a heart attack a month before she was due to go. She said she didn't feel well so I called the doctor. I watched him in disbelief as he pounded on her chest with his fist, cracking her ribs in the process. I rang for an ambulance and thankfully the medics came within minutes. They continued resuscitation all the way to the hospital and they managed to save her life. For several months after she wasn't well. I was writing to Ingo in English and he was writing to me in German. We both had to get our letters translated. I told him that she wouldn't be able to travel, even though she was recovering from the heart attack, she had developed angina. He would have to come here to see her. Ingo wrote to say he would come on the 1st of April 1982, he would fly into Heathrow Airport and I said I would be there to meet him. She died on March 20th, she never saw her son again, and he never saw his mum. My darling mother, after all this time I am still carrying the pain of your passing, the tears of sadness flow freely from my eyes, on this day every year.RIP Martha Elizabeth Helen 4.3.1918 - 20.3.1982"}, {"title": "Not a stroll in the park", "date": "Friday 19 March 2010", "text": "I finally decided that my walk was going to be a one day walk, so I asked my mate Tony if he would like to come along. He wasn't needed at work so he he said he would. Tony isn't an experienced walker, in fact never tackled anything like this before. He was happy to leave the route to me, saying that ten miles was about right. He also warned me that he was a fast walker, I didn't mind because I wanted to get more miles under my belt anyway. We got to Pateley Bridge, a pretty stone cottagey type small town a few miles north of Harrogate in North Yorkshire, at 9.50am and got on our way at 10am. We left the car in a long stay car park, I was certain that we would be back before they closed the gates at 6pm.We set off along the Nidderdale Way, this is a circular 53 mile long distance footpath around the valley of the River Nidd. It wasn't long before we reached Gouthwaite Reservoir. Quite often you can walk along the top of a dam, but this one had locked gates across. I was only able to get this photo of the impressive structure as it was partially screened by trees and bushes. The path follows the edge of the reservoir along the whole of it's length, I looked back and took another shot, you can just see the top of the dam on the left.And another view forward. By now we were striding along, the well walked path was easy to follow. We arrived at Bouthwaite at the other end of the reservoir, and continued on to Lofthouse.Tony was beginning to flag a bit so I suggested we take refreshment, there is a hotel marked on the map. His pace quickened when we saw the sign for The Crown, 500 yards. Amazingly a real log fire was ablaze in the grate as we walked in, very hot and thirsty. A pint and a half of cider was ordered and we went out to the garden to sit in the sun. It was turning into a glorious day. The view beyond the lovingly maintained gardens, of the hills reaching up to a perfect blue sky, made me think, you can't get better than this.It didn't seem to matter that we ate our own sandwiches, in fact I think it was positively encouraged. The elderly rather portly dog which eyed us up in the bar, rose slowly to it's feet and walked ahead of us towards the door. I realised later that he has probably gone through this ritual many times before. We sat down, and so did the dog. He seemed to have a fixation towards Tony, and more importantly to what he was eating. I'm sure he sensed that Tony had the meat and I didn't. It was so funny, his stare never wavered, pleading with his eyes untill Tony caved in. Clever dog.Leaving The Crown we went up Trapping Hill, a minor road which climbed steeply towards Lofthouse Moor. Nearing the top we took a footpath on the left which took us along the edge of the moor past Thrope Edge. It was very high up here and gave spectacular views.We were striding along without our jackets on and hadn't noticed the cloud coming over. The wind started buffeting us from across the moors, but we didn't care, we joked as we went along. Two walkers coming towards us were well wrapped up with all the gear, they looked frozen with drips from their noses, and I could swear that one of them had tears running down his face. Anyone seeing us would have wondered what we were on, all I can say is that we had taken copious amounts of our glorious countryside. Surely better than any drug you can get from a dodgy guy on a street corner, and virtually free as well.I didn't take many photo's because Tony seemed keen to stride on. I'm not sure whether he wanted to get to the end more quickly, but I did say that if he was uncomfortable or he was in pain, I could modify the walk and cut it short and head back. He said his feet were hurting and his back was aching a bit, but he was alright to carry on.Coming down off the moors we did a u-turn and rejoined the Nidderdale Way to head back. By now jackets were needed, as it looked as if we were in for some rain. I hate walking over the same ground twice so I picked out a route which made a slight detour bypassing Lofthouse, and through a small village called Middlesmoor. We checked the time every so often and I reckoned it would get us back to the car just within the 6pm deadline, although it would be cutting it a bit fine.So no time to waste, we quickened the pace. We planned to come back down the other side of the reservoir, using mainly footpaths but a little bit of road walking. I'm pleased we took the detour because we came across How Stean Gorge. The road goes along side it and you can look down into a deep ravine, and see the caves and massive rocks below. Pity we haven't time to stop and explore.All was going well, we were making good time....untill we came across a stream that we had to cross. I'm sure there should have been a footbridge, or some stepping stones to get across. Maybe the fast flowing water had washed the stones away. We could see the stile on the other side that we had to climb over, but how can we get across the water. Tony found a spot with two or three large stones which were above the level of the water, and decided he could stride across. I didn't have the confidence to try it as my stride is not as long as his, and one of the stones was partly submerged and was no doubt slippery.There was only one thing for it. I took my boots and socks off, rolled my trousers up to the knee, and gingerly stepped into the freezing water. I was in danger of losing my balance not knowing how deep it was, and how slippery the stones were, so halfway across I hurled my boots towards Tony so I could use my hands to steady myself. I reached the big boulders on the other side, my feet were so painfull with the cold, I thought I was going to lose my toes to frostbite. After half an hour of walking they were just about getting back to normal.Further on we came across this non stream. It looked a bit strange, dry rocks, I've no idea where the water went. This one was a lot easier to cross, ha ha.Passing Ramsgill we still had a long way to go, but I was still optimistic we would make it and get the car out before 6pm. Although we were covering a lot of ground quite quickly I must admit I was becoming a bit anxious as I checked the map, and the time, every few minutes. I hate deadlines. By now Tony was almost on his knees with his painfull feet, but he put a brave face on it. At 5.15pm our chances of getting there on time were becoming slim. We had decided to stay on the road for the last few miles as it seemed the most direct, and made quicker easier walking.We passed a bus stop and eagerly studied the time table, was there a bus coming, no. Only one thing left to do, try and get a lift. When we heard a vehicle approaching we turned to face it, put our thumbs up in good old hitch hiking fashion, and prayed for someone to stop. It's a long time since I have done that. Eventually a guy in a Range Rover took pity on us and pulled up. We couldn't thank him enough. I was surprised at how much further we travelled in the car, getting the lift was the right thing to do. We would never have walked that distance in the time we had left.I have checked the distance we walked, and it was 16 miles. If we hadn't had a time restriction I am sure I could have walked the last three miles.

I have spent most of this week searching through my maps, checking hostels on the internet, checking routes, distances, where is the best place to start a walk from......and it goes on. I couldn't find a hostel within a reasonable distance that can accommodate me for two nights, most are getting booked up on Saturday nights now. So I picked the area around Pateley Bridge north of Harrogate to walk, then looked for somewhere I might stay. Sorry fully booked, I'm too late. Missed my chance.So then I thought never mind it is warm enough for camping, I got the tent out to check it over. I haven't used it for about five years, all is ok. Then I found a campsite exactly where I wanted to stay, and checked their web site. Not open till Easter. It's also \u00a312 a pitch which I thought is a bit much, it's only a little tent.I thought I'd better check the weather forecast, light rain on Saturday, chucking it down on Saturday night, showers on Sunday. Don't fancy that, maybe I'll camp when the weather improves, wonder how long I'll have to wait.I have changed my mind yet again. I am now only going for the day, tomorrow. I had to ring my friend Janet to say she doesn't need to come and feed the cats after all, as my three day trip has turned into one day. So now I must pack my rucksack, now what do I need to take, oh heck, I've got a headache now. There is a walking forum meet up on Sunday in Derbyshire, I wonder if I should go on that one.

First of all I walked down to the kennels to see Henry choc lab have his second swim. He was a bit apprehensive about going into the water and had to be enticed with some toys to play with, but once he was paddling around he enjoyed it. Here he is getting dried off by Jimmy.  Helen and I took him for a walk, and I just happened to have my pick stick and bag with me, wasn't that convenient, so I did a bit of tidying up as well. Then I had a phone call from Flora, can I call in and see Ben and give him his lunch, there is some chicken for him. Poor old Ben has been poorly for a couple of days and after not eating anything for 24 hours, he is allowed chicken and rice to settle his stomach. Flora thinks he might have eaten something nasty. He seemed ok so I took him out for a gentle stroll. Luckily I had my pick stick and bag with me, a bit more tidying, ha ha.I went back later at about 4.30pm and took him for another short walk, no litter picking this time. On the way back we were passing the surgery, and I noticed Sue cat lady had arrived to start work, so I stopped for a natter. Guess who should turn up, yes that's right, Mr Beasley.  I took Ben home, came back for Mr Beasley, picked him up and took him home. He scoffed two pouches of Felix, he was ravenous. I thought I might let him stay the night and take him back in the morning, but when my Bugsy came down the stairs and saw him there was a big hissy fit and a lot of growling. Oh dear, I don't think this is going to work very well. Sorry, Mr B, you'll have to go home. He has a lovely home, I stopped for a few minutes to talk to his owner, she is such a nice young lady, both her and her son adore the cat, but she now thinks he might have to be rehomed. The thing is would he stay in a new home. We both agreed he is the equivelant of a stroppy teenager, wants to be top cat, and wants his freedom. He is very vocal and if he wants something he jolly well lets you know about it. I eventually ate my dinner at 8.30pm. What a busy cat and dog day it's been."}, {"title": "Litter picking, a whole new world", "date": "Tuesday 16 March 2010", "text": "Pick sticks are like buses, you wait ages for one, then two come at once, ha ha :-) I mentioned my new hobby to my friend, and she said 'There's a stick in my front porch you can have, you should have said so before.' So now I have got two.The top one is the council stick. I have been out today to test drive them. I used the council stick for an hour this morning, and the other one for half an hour this afternoon. Overall I found the council stick easier to use because the jaw opens both top and bottom, and the round shape is ideal for picking up cans and bottles. However, the bottom stick grips tiny items like ring pulls much better due to the overlap of the plastic covered ends. Both are quite comfortable to use, not too heavy, and you don't have to put a lot of presure on the trigger to get them to grip tightly. First of all I took a black bin bag out with me and put everything into it, but it soon became quite heavy with the bottles. I want to recycle the clean cans, and plastic and glass bottles, but this means sorting it out when I get back, and of course all the filthy stuff has contaminated the newish items which were still clean as they have only recently been discarded. On my second session I took a largish carrier bag instead, and this made it easier to carry, then I tipped the rubbish into the bin bag when I got back. I have learnt to turn the drinks cans upside down as I pick them up because they might be full of water if they have been lying there for some time. Also crisp packets can have water in them as well. Tomorrow I'm going to take two or three carrier bags out with me so I can keep the clean recyclable stuff separate. This litter picking is all very technical.I have been doing a bit of research into it, and I have discovered that pick sticks come in several models with lots of different features. There is the Nifty Nabber, the Trashstick, and the Ez Grabber. Some have a four finger trigger, or a rotating shaft, or a magnetic end. I quite fancy the model with the intellilight, that's a light on the end which comes on automatically when you retrieve something from dark, hard to reach places. Cool eh! You can have non slip flexible rubber gripper cups, a rotating head, and a locking feature, with a choice of length, 24ins, 27ins, or 32ins. Blimey, which one is best, it's almost as difficult as choosing a new dress. Did you know there is a web site just for litter pickers? You can send your photo and they will put it on. And I was worried that people might think I am a bit barmy, it's comforting to know there are a lot more like me out there, I am not alone.www.litterheroes.co.ukIf I feel this job is a bit beyond me, I can go on a training course with Keep Britain Tidy. I can join their Network, and go to their annual conference in Manchester. It's a pity I have missed this years though, it takes place today and tomorrow.   I wonder if they have any litter picker competitions, now that would be exciting :0)"}, {"title": "It's all a load of rubbish", "date": "Monday 15 March 2010", "text": "I had to be a bit organised this morning, as I was due to give a talk to the members of a Probus club, near Doncaster, and punctuality is not one of my strong points. No pottering around in my slobby clothes today, I needed to smarten myself up and look a bit respectable. My talk was about simple living, recycling, and living within your means. I visited this group about a year ago, they made me very welcome and I had a great time, so I was looking forward to seeing them all again.I took along some props to illustrate my talk, a selection of items I have made out of recycled rubbish. The room was very big so they fixed me up with one of those radio microphones, and after the committe reports I was called upon to do my bit. I normally talk without notes, but as this is a newish talk I thought it sensble to jot down a few words, just in case I dried up. I needn't have worried.Everything went according to plan, they are such a cheeky lot, and the banter made it so much easier for me. It is a pleasure to do when the audience is only there to enjoy themselves. Afterwards I joined them in the bar for a glass of lemonade, and the jokes were coming thick and fast. It was a great way to spend a Monday morning, all I've got to do now is design another talk for next year :o)Hooray, I have got my litter picking stick from the council, I found it when I got back, along with loads of black sacks. I must say I am a little bit disappointed though, on closer inspection I see they have not given me a new one, it is second hand. Surely if they can afford to install a brand new massive flat screen tv in the reception area of the main offices, they could buy me a new stick, especially as I've had to wait nearly four weeks for it. Oh well, looks as if I am out litter picking tomorrow, I'll let you know how I get on."}, {"title": "Meet the boss, just for today", "date": "Sunday 14 March 2010", "text": "I'm not getting a lot done today, here is the culprit. Daren't take my eyes off him for too long as he's into all kinds of mischief. No Henry, you can't eat the mouse.Plenty of walks though, up early in the woods for an hour, rest for a couple of hours when I can perhaps do a bit of sewing. Then he wakes up and wants to join in.He is so intelligent and a bit cheeky. He usually comes to me when I call him, but if he decides that he must jump into water, he dashes around frantically trying to find some. It could be a filthy ditch with a couple of inches of mud trickling through, or a pond a couple of feet deep. He always comes with a towel in his overnight bag, this is for drying him off when we get back. Off out again in five minutes. He is lying by my side waiting for the words, 'Do you want to go out?'Last night we were out for the, just before bed time walk, and who should we meet but Mr Beasley, well it had to be didn't it! I called him and he came towards me, hesitating when he saw Henry, who wanted to play. He thinks all cats will play now, because mine are quite happy with him being around. Mr Beasley hissed a bit and kept his distance, so I called him to follow me. Of course the fella was hungry so he followed us back home.Mr B immediately scoffed two pouches of Felix, and I rang his owner. It was nearly half past ten, and if Henry hadn't been there I would have kept him till the morning. Five minutes later a car came and he was whisked back home.....again.Right must go, my every move is being scrutinised as Henry waits in anticipation, he is gorgeous."}, {"title": "There's always Hope", "date": "Saturday 13 March 2010", "text": "Good morning, and it looks like it's going to be another lovely day again. I am not going far this weekend because Henry choc lab is coming for a sleepover, so I am getting on with this post before he comes bounding through the front door wanting lots of fuss and attention.Sorry I didn't get to post yesterday, I went on another excursion. I set off for Derbyshire even though the weather wasn't particularly pleasant. A bit overcast, drizzly, and gloomy. Going through Sheffield I thought about giving up as the rain drowned everyone going to work, but I carried on through Hathersage and Bamford, and parked at Hope outside this lovely church. The rain had eased off by the time I was ready to set off for my walk.I had it in mind to gain a bit of height today, but it looked like the weather was not going to allow me any fantastic views. Oh well, you never know, the misty clouds might lift, and the sun might just show it's face, I live in Hope, ha ha. I took a path out of the village towards Lose Hill and met an elderley couple walking in the opposite direction. Most walkers are cheerfull and it was lovely to spend a few minutes chatting to this sprightly couple. They told me they are in their late seventies, live in Sheffield, and come walking three times a week. I hope I am doing the same when I reach their age, wonderfull stuff. They seemed quite knowledgeble about the area and pointed out Mam Tor, quite a big hill. I thought, that's where I will be heading for.This is one of many stiles to cross, you can see Lose Hill in the distance. The rain started again and I stopped to put my waterproof over trousers on, which immediately inflated with the wind whipping around me. I looked up to the heavens and shouted, 'now rain all you like because I don't care, I am ready, and I'm going up there', ha ha.Onward and upward, head down, one step at a time. I was in my own little world thinking there was only me daft enough to do this, when something caught my attention in the corner of my eye. I glanced sideways to see a young twenty something woman in skimpy sports gear, pony tail dancing in the wind, picking her way over the rocks and grass. She was running like the wind towards the top. After that I saw quite a few other people, I definately wasn't alone.Here I am almost at the top, it would have been a lovely view, if........Here is the top of Lose Hill. The wind and rain were buffeting me from the side, thank goodness I had this stone to hold on to. I didn't dare step too close to the edge. It's a wonder the photo turned out, I couldn't even hold the camera steady.This is the path away from Lose Hill, looking towards Mam Tor. It looks neat and tidy doesn't it. Some of the badly eroded sections have been repaired and replaced with large stone slabs. Mam Tor is lost in the mist. Just as I was setting off again another lone walker appeared. He looked a big bloke so I asked if I could walk with him for a while across the exposed top, as I was in fear of being blown off. Well that was my excuse anyway:0) He was a pleasant chap. I let him go on alone after about fifteen minutes as he was in training for an endurance walk, and I didn't want to hold him back. I know how seriously these fitness fanatics take their walking.At last it was beginning to brighten up a bit and I caught a glimpse of the highest peak, Mam Tor. You can see it at the top of the picture, it's still got a bit of snow left on it. I stopped at this big rock for a bite to eat, as it gave some shelter from the wind. You can see a line of walkers coming along. When I set off again I passed them all, having lunch in a sheltered spot behind those trees.This is the view I had as I had my lunch, beautiful isn't it?Off I went again, the weather is getting better. Some nice views on each side, a little bit of sun, lighting up the wonderful tapestry below me.A little bit of blue sky.Mam Tor is getting closer now. I let two walkers overtake me, their chattering was irritating. As far as I'm concerned the only way to enjoy this spiritual place is to be completely alone with nature. I'm not religious, but this is God's heaven. Getting closer, this stone marks Hollins Cross. It's a place where many footpaths meet, there is a quick way down to the bottom from here.Now I'm in a quandry, do I take the grassy cycle path or the foot path? It doesn't matter, they run along side each other. I choose to walk on the cycle path, easier on the knees and boots.Whew! Here I am, arrived at the top. I didn't take any more pictures because I have already taken enough, and any more would have been the same.Nobody up here, so I took a picture of myself.To complete my anti clockwise big circle on the map, I descended at this point, and set off in a southerly direction, over Windy Knoll, across the fields, crossing Limestone Way, and heading towards Bradwell. I skirted around a limestone quarry, and took a path which went alongside a massive works. There was huge buildings and sheds on both sides, a tall chimney which dominated the skyline, and enclosed conveyor belts crossing the path overhead. The monotonous droning of the machinery was in complete contrast to the stillness I had just left behind. I wondered how the people living in the houses close by could live with this noise in the background every minute of every day. I shouldn't complain, we have to be gratefull for the jobs it gives to people. At least they had marked out the footpath to make getting past it easy.A short walk back into Hope, and I was ready to leave at ten past five. Total distance walked - 10.25 miles. Timed just right to call in at Tesco on the way in, and get my reduced price shopping. I also had a \u00a36 off voucher on a \u00a340 spend, so I went round with pen and paper adding up as I filled my trolley. Got some smashing bargains, so I'm happy."}, {"title": "An aquired taste", "date": "Thursday 11 March 2010", "text": "I bought a packet of this organic three grain bread because I remember mum getting something like it sent over in a food parcel from Germany, when I was a mere slip of a girl. It came in a box with a lot of other weird and wonderful food items. Mum was so pleased when it arrived as it reminded her of home. Of course we were excited as well because there was often some German sweeties and chocolate for us to fight over.We tried everything in the parcel, but weren't impressed with the bread that looked and tasted like cork table mats, so mum always ate the whole packet herself. I wondered if the taste had improved over the years so I got this to try.On the packet it says it contains rye, oats, and barley, linseed, sesame seed, and apple fibre. It has no preservatives, is low in fat, and high in fibre, and is vegetarian, so it's got to be good for you. So why does it still taste blooming horrible :-0 You'd have thought after all this time, about 50 years to be precise, they could make it a bit more palatable. Never mind, I shall soldier on with it and eat every last crumb, even if I have to force it down my throat. . I popped in Asda the other day as I was passing, just to check out the 'whoopsies'. For those who don't know what a whoopsie is, it's when their buying department gets in too many of an item and no one wants to buy it so they have to get rid of it at a reduced price or they will be lumbered with it and have to bin it. Whoopsa daisy we have made a cock up here, better get rid quick, ha ha. Anyway, I bought these two fruits in a bag for 30p. Haven't the faintest idea what they are, I got them because they were cheap. They are quite big, green and red with a smooth skin, and yellow flesh. It tastes a bit like pineapple. Anyone know what they are?"}, {"title": "English Journey", "date": "Wednesday 10 March 2010", "text": "My first thought when I wake up each morning is, 'what day is it?' Without fail I ask myself that question. This is one luxury I am very gratefull for, to be able to spend half an hour or so gently emerging from my sleep and quietly contemplating what the day ahead might bring. I am in complete control, how I fill the hours and minutes is entirely up to me. After ten months of retirement I never dreamed it could be this wonderfull.Some people fear the day they have to stop going to work, the routine of clocking in every morning, chatting with their work colleagues and tasks to be completed, it all gives a purpose to life. I used to be the same, I remember I laughed at the older drivers when they said they couldn't wait to get out. I was so in love with the job I joked that as long as I could climb into the cab with the aid of my zimmer frame, I would carry on driving till the end.So what changed? Well I am convinced it wasn't me. I have thought about it long and hard. I still have that craving for freedom of movement which the job gave me. I still have an appetite for exploration and learning. I still have the confidence required to do the job and the intelligence to work alone, to make decisions, and to do what I think best. It's the job that has changed.I find the whole work ethic fascinating, and have recently found this interesting book which gives detailed descriptions of many workplaces throughout the UK. I haven't read any J B Priestley before but I am really getting into this. English Journey was first published in 1934 and is just as relevant today as it was then. His journey starts in Southampton, then Bristol, Swindon, Cotswolds, Birmingham, the Midlands, Yorkshire, Lancashire, the North East, and back down to Lincoln and Norfolk. He gave up driving after crashing into a lamp post, and used rail, motor bus, and a chauffeur driven car for his wanderings. Maybe the modern day equivelant would be to do it on a bus pass :o)The book paints fascinating pictures of work places. What I like about it is the down to earth, plain speaking descriptions. There is no political correctness, he says what he thinks. Of the Potteries he says, 'Undignified and ugly little towns, the rows of dingy dolls houses, the narrow streets that lead from one dreariness to another'.He visited a hosiery factory in Leicester, detailing the tedious piece-work that the girls spent hours at. The manager explained, 'In his experience girls preferred purely routine and monotonous jobs because once they learnt the fairly simple necessary movements they could then work all day and think about something else while they were working'. I remember doing piece-work myself, in a toilet roll factory. I don't think they call it piece-work any more, it's called targets, ahhh, the dreaded targets:0(And so today, I have no piece work, I have no targets. Good or bad? I don't know. Maybe I'll set myself a few goals, who knows. Perhaps I'll roller skate around the UK and write the follow up to this book, ha ha."}, {"title": "Plain crazy", "date": "Tuesday 9 March 2010", "text": "I've been kerb crawling round the industrial estates today, looking for stuff for the Scrapstore. It's very sad that such a lot of warehouses and factories lie empty, with For Sale or To Let boards on the front of them. The way this recession is going I can't see them being occupied ever again. Such a waste and such a shame that they are left to crumble into disrepair, and become derelict. No wonder people's moral is low when they have to pass these eyesore buildings, day in day out.I visited eight businesses with my begging bowl, and managed to fill my car with cardboard tubes, offcuts from two sign makers, massive rolls of paper, and loads of plastic buckets with lids, from a food processing factory.I am going to take a small step ladder with me next time because I nearly fell into a skip. Also, when I get the litter picker I will be able to use that to retrieve items I can't reach. I had to rummage around amongst a lot of disgustingly smelly plastic and carboard packaging, to reach the large buckets which were near the bottom. Some of them had pieces of cooked potatoes in them, and no I didn't bring them home for my dinner, ha ha. The food comes into the factory in these buckets, they repackage it into small portions, and the buckets get chucked. I thought that was terrible, what a waste of perfectly good buckets.I must say a lot of firms are extremely good at recycling their waste, especially if they can sell it on. But some can't be bothered and send it to landfill in a skip. I heard a story from one guy at a kitchen and bedroom furniture maker, which really annoyed me. Apparently they had been giving their wood offcuts to someone for their wood burner, and someone from the council had seen this person collect his firewood. The company was prosecuted and taken to court and fined.He didn't say why, but I know our council is very heavy handed where rules and regulations are concerned. I had a few discussions with them when I was starting a business, about how I was going to dispose of my trade waste. I wanted to recycle my very small amounts of tins, cardboard, glass, and plastics in the appropriate bins at a collection point. Shock horror, you can't do that. You need a trade waste bin which will be emptied every week, the contents will go to landfill and you will pay for it! I told them where to stick it. In the end I didn't start the business it was far too much hassle.In fact I am sure that if the council found out that I am removing stuff from skips, (with the owners permission of course), they would find a way to put a stop to it. Waste from business premises is dealt with in a completely different way to household waste. The council are always on our backs to sort our own waste and recycle everything, because of the cost of putting it into landfill. Yet they think nothing of chucking whole skip loads into a big hole without sorting it out. It is just plain crazy to me."}, {"title": "Nude vegetables", "date": "Monday 8 March 2010", "text": "Well that's my lodger gone then, and I'm just munching my way through this lot.

I'm going to stretch it over three meals.This meal is typical of what I eat most nights, a big plate of steamed veg, with an addition of something or other. This time it's a grilled salmon portion.I must say, whenever I eat out, which isn't very often these days, the veg is usually boiled to bits and tasteless. I never buy tinned veg except the odd tin of mushy peas, and the only frozen veg I buy is sweetcorn, and peas. All other frozen veg is soggy and has no taste, yuk !So this is my simple, good for you dinner, asparagus, potatoes, carrots, peas, cabbage, salmon. No faffing with sauce, gravy, or any other dressings. Nude vegetables are fantastic.I have a confession to make, I didn't sleep alone last night. At 6.30am my companion jumped all over me, so I had to get up because I was not going to be allowed any more shuteye. What can you do, I had no choice but to climb out of my nest, gulp down half a cup of coffee, with beady eyes watching my every movement, untill we stepped out of the front door.'Come on Auntie, hurry up, I've got my legs crossed here'Five minutes later we were in the woods, boots crunching through the dry winter twigs, with frost glistening in the morning sun. I love mornings, it's the best part of the day. This morning everything is bright and sparkly, and fresh and crisp. Blue sky with the sun peeping out between the trees, what more could you wish for :-)'Was that a rabbit I saw just there'.In my head I hear the song 'Oh What A Beautiful Morning' and I can't help singing it out loud.

She liked it, and we discussed how it would fit in with some of their exhibitions and workshops.It would fit in well with a recycling project they are planning for July, so I said I would be happy to go along and display my work and talk to the visitors who are interested. There is also the possibility of exhibiting some of the items in a glass display case.The Scrapstore will be tied in with this also. I am really excited about the opportunity to pass on ideas so that other people might be inspired to try and make things as well. The most important message though is to think about what we are throwing away, and that everything should be used again wherever possible.Now I have to think of a title for myself which reflects what I do, to go into the next brochure, so what do I call myself?

I thought it would be a good idea to take photographs which remind us of the wonderful place we live in. I spotted these pretty catkins today. I am high up overlooking the River Trent at Alkborough, less than three miles from my house. This is one of my favourite walks.Spring is definately coming. Mother nature is waking up the woodland plants and flowers once again. How sweet the snowdrops are, pushing their way up through the carpet of dry leaves.   I looked out of my window at about 6pm tonight and caught a glimpse of a lovely sunset, behind the houses across the road. I grabbed the camera and ran down the street to the back of the church, hoping I wasn't too late. Just a few minutes left before it disappeared over the horizon.  The blood red sky was reflected in the river below.I couldn't walk away untill it had gone, it was so beautiful it brought tears to my eyes.

No not loads more photo's, just the one, which I had to lie down on my back in a ditch to take. I thought it was a bit different.Talking of photo's, thank you for your comments on my last post, I very much appreciate it. I am a little bit disappointed however that although I post photo's at the biggest size allowed, they are not big enough. It would be a better if the width of the photo was the same width as the text. When I put them on the walking forum they are bigger and look so much better. I know you can click on them and a new page opens with the photo blown up, but then it is too big to fit on the screen, and you have to scroll sideways, not ideal. I am to become the chief litter picker in my village. That's as soon as the council gets their finger out and provides me with a picking stick and some black bags. I contacted the secretary of our parish council to volunteer my services, she then contacted the council offices in town, and I had an email from her to say someone would be in touch with me. That was over two weeks ago, I emailed her to say I'd heard nothing. At last they contacted me and said they would drop the equipment off at my house. I am not holding my breath, everything is so long winded with the council. We will be knee high in rubbish by the time it arrives. I decided to offer to do this job, (a) because I already walk around the village dog walking anyway, and (b) I am sick of seeing the mess. It is mostly wrappings and cans that the youngsters throw down, despite the fact we have enough bins. I think the only way to deal with the problem is to do battle with the little beggars, why should a few people spoil things for the many people who are proud to live here. I can see me becoming about as popular as Linda Snell in The Archers, a noseying busybody, ha ha. I went to donate blood yesterday, but they didn't want it. Another low iron level reading. Oh dear, I am going to have to up the Guiness intake, and maybe a bottle of red wine will help just before my next attempt to donate. Remember Mr Beasley, the cantankerous but lovely pussy cat that won't stay at home. I walked past the bungalow where he used to live yesterday, calling his name, just in case he was about. I often do this but he is not usually there, mainly because someone else has picked him up and taken him back home. Well yesterday he came running to me when I called, I quickly grabbed hold of him and virtually ran home with him clutched tightly to my body. After he scoffed two pouches of Felix cat food, I rang his owner, put him in a cat carrier, and drove him home. Once again his owner was gratefull to get him back. We don't know how to stop him from doing this. His home is down the hill over half a mile away, yet he keeps coming back up to the bungalow. As soon as he was let loose in the house, he was on the sofa enjoying lots of cuddles, purring like mad and rolling about, obviously pleased to be back. I bet he thinks we are right mugs. All he has to do is go for a stroll, get fed lots of food, and get a car ride back again. I think I'm being taken for a ride. But he is lovely though.

I took ninetyfive, but have managed to get it down to thirtytwo, phew. Anyway, let's crack on. I went to Lockton which is a small village north of Pickering, just off the A169. This is the area of the North Yorkshire Railway, it looks a bit interesting on the map. There has been a lot of heavy rain causing flooding in the area, so I wondered what I was going to find.The weather wasn't too good, frequent showers which became more persistant as the day went on, however my new jacket was doing it's job and kept me dry. I set off and this is the first view I saw as I turned a corner behind the old rectory, and left the village behind.I walked along the top of a wood which fell very steeply down on my right hand side. The path started off very muddy and continued like this for a long time. Soon I was scrambling down through the scrub, being attacked by spikey bushes on all sides. The path continued to descend very steeply as I struggled to remain upright. At the bottom I came over this stile. Eventually I came to a farm next to the railway line. The path I wanted to take through a field was completely impassable, it was waterlogged. Time for a drink and a quick bite to eat, next to this water wheel. All of a sudden I heard the distinct toot toot of a train approaching, I didn't think there were any running this early in the season. I looked up and saw a steam train, wow, got to get a picture of this. In my haste to get my camera out of my pocket and get a good position, I managed to trip over the towing hitch of a small trailer which laid on the ground. A split second later I was sprawled out on the grass with my face in the mud. I don't mind if you laugh, because I did. I jumped up and pointed the camera, yep think I have got it. When I checked, oh dear, I have cut the front of the engine off, what a shame, that would have been so good.I thought I would put this photo in here as an example of the mud I was having to do battle with. In the summer this would be a pleasant bridleway to saunter along. No, this isn't where I fell thank goodness.My alternative route was over the railway line and follow the path alongside. I knew I had to cross back over further up at Levisham Station. More mud to do battle with, and rain as well. I was paying so much attention to where I was putting my feet, I couldn't find the path I wanted. I went a bit too far, but no matter, I was able to turn right onto a tarmac road, which took me to the station, where I asked the ladies in the refreshment room if I might sit in their dry shelter for ten minutes to eat my sandwiches. They said, that's ok.Suddenly it got quite busy, men in orange overalls came from nowhere and started busying themselves in anticipation of something about to happen. The warning siren sounded as they closed the crossing gates, so I guessed there would be a train arriving. I asked if it would be a steam engine. One man said the first would be a diesel, and the second would be a diesel but it would be towing a steam engine at the back. Another chance, I thought, yipee. So here they are, both stopped on the platform. They look like they are side by side going in the same direction, so I have cheated really. I love steam trains. I set off from the station along the road, I'd had enough of mud and rain so I decided to go back to Lockton on tarmac. The road was very steep, with a hairpin bend at the top, just off the bend was a footpath straight on, still climbing, onto the moor. I checked the map and saw I could make a diversion to get some more height. Even though it was still raining I was determined to get up there, wow what a view! This is the picture I took at the top looking down on the road I had just walked up. A little bit of lingering snow left. The photo is a bit hazy due to the rain, but well worth the effort of getting up there.There was a choice of which way to go next, but as time was getting on and it was still raining, I decided to follow a wide path which changed to a road. I stayed on the road through Levisham village, a chocolatey box picture village, pity I don't have time to linger. My walking mileage for the first day was 7.87 By 5pm I was setting off for the youth hostel at Boggle Hole. I got a bit lost because I wasn't sure which road off the main road I had to approach it from. Eventually I saw the YHA sign, three miles to the hostel. Then I came to a sign that said 'To The Sea Only'. By this time it was getting dark. I knew you had to park before you got there and walk the rest of the way. At last I found the car park, and set off down the track with my rucksack, cool box full of food, and a holdall, walking into the blackness. I was beginning to wonder where I was going, would I end up in the sea! After five minutes I could see the lights through the trees, I could hear the sea but not see it. I was given an eight bed dormitory all to myself, great. Time to cook dinner.The next morning I saw how close to the sea we were. The main building has a waterfall behind it, with water continually flowing down the side of it, which then goes out to sea. When the tide is out you can drive a four wheel drive or a pick up truck, down the ramp and over the sand and pebble beach, to the courtyard. When they have a delivery they have to take their smaller vehicle up to the car park where the lorry will be waiting, to collect their stock. The building at the back, up lots of steps, is the annexe. A party of school girls were put in there on the Monday night, I'm glad they weren't next door to me.In the picture you can see a pick up truck. Two men came to repair a wall, this is the ramp they had to drive down, then sharp left over the beach. There is a gap in the fence for pedestrians, you follow the walkway over a wooden bridge.I took a short walk onto the beach and took this photo looking towards Robin Hood's Bay.I decided to follow the footpath north from the hostel onto the Cleveland Way, towards Robin Hood's Bay. Not far to go now.Thought I'd better have my photo taken. As you can see the weather is much improved today, in fact it is glorious, I have removed some of my layers.Almost there now, this wonderful boardwalk makes it easier.This charming olde worlde place is full of tiny cottages packed tightly together. Some of them must never get any sunlight through the windows, and not much privacy either. The best time to visit is out of season, it must get heaving with tourists in the summer. Some of the streets are only the width of a couple of paving slabs, as you walk around you feel like you should be apologising for encroaching on their territory. I try not to look in the windows.After half an hour of wandering around this model like village, and partaking of a double chocolate and toffee cone, it was time to continue my walk along the coast. I like to check the view behind me as I go, to see where I have just been, and thought this was lovely.I headed inland towards Hawsker and walked along a disused railway track for a while. The railway between Whitby and Scarborough closed in the nineteen sixties, and now it is maintained as a walkway and cycle track. The old station here has been turned into a cycle hire place and cafe.The two carriages are full of bicycles.From here I set off back along the road which goes right through Fyling Hall School. Very strange, you think you are on private property because there is a big white gate at the entrance with the name of the school on a sign on a stone post. This was my longest day at 12.39 miles.Day three and I set off south from the hostel, on the Cleveland Way. These are the steps at the start, quite a steep climb onto the top of the cliff. A bit further on I found a lot of neat steps, thank goodness someone has built these for us walkers.These were steps that went down towards the beach.And then back up again. I decided to have a walk along the beach, might as well while I am there.Some distance away I could see a waterfall coming from the top of the rocks, worth an investigation, I thought. I wasn't sure about the times of the incoming tide so I kept my eye on the waters edge just in case I had to do a runner back to the safety of the path. Isn't it lovely.As I walked around the other side of it, with my back to the sun, I found a rainbow, even better, this is my lucky day.Magical, I love rainbows.While down on the beach, I got a different view of just how much of the edge was crumbling and falling into the sea. Large chunks of earth and vegitation are slipping away, in some places the path was only three feet wide. It wont be long before they have to move the boundary further inland. This concrete bunker type building is already losing it's foundations, you can see the right hand side of it jutting out. I think they will have to take it down before it falls down.Look at this lovely wooden bridge, it's a work of art. Thank you to the people who put it there.I'm not far from Ravenscar now. This is the view looking inland.And this is the view looking out over the sea.I'm almost in Ravenscar now. In the distance is Robin Hood's Bay, where I was yesterday. Wouldn't you just love a view like that, I could sit and look at it for ages.I am beginning to feel a little bit weary now but there is still time to do a bit more, don't want to get back too early. I left the cliff top at this point, and continued my journey along the disused railway line/cycle track. After a mile or so I turned sharp right to head back to the car at the hostel. I hadn't done much moorland walking so I set off across Brow Moor and Howdale Moor. A bit early for the heather, and a bit flat, but thankfully not much mud.Once off the moor my legs were beginning to turn to jelly and I still had a good bit further to go. I always push myself to the limit. I walked through a farmyard and looked for the stile out the other side. I found this gentleman waiting for me, my knight in shining armour, and I was his damsel in distress. It's a pity he didn't have a white horse to whisk me off to the car. Nice to see a farmer with a good sense of humour.My mileage for the last day was 11.18 making a total of 31.44 for the three days. I'm quite pleased with that. I hope you like my photo's, thanks for looking."}, {"title": "Me blinkin feet are sore!", "date": "Tuesday 2 March 2010", "text": "I'm back and I've had a wonderful time. Haven't checked how many miles I've walked yet, but my legs ache and I have one blister. Hope I've got some good photo's I took loads. I've been on the beach, over the moors, along the cliff top, through farmyards, alongside the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, along a disused railway track that is now a walking/cycling route, through woods and fields, and up and down hundreds of steps. The hostel was almost on the beach and I had an eight bed dormitory to myself. Couldn't be better.

I also cleaned two more windows, this time at the back. Two is all I can manage in one go, then I get bored. My attention threshold is very low, half an hour and I have to do something else. I had a quick whip round with the Dyson, the cat litter was getting spread about by over enthusiastic scratching cats.My walking boots were still filthy after the walk last week, another cleaning job I do not relish. I generally don't bother, they are only going to get dirty again. I thought I'd better make the effort, they might last longer if I look after them.So after brushing all the dry mud off with an old washing up brush, they got a generous layer of wax. They look a bit better now.I must have been in the mood for cleaning boots, I polished up my posh going out boots, gave them a nice shine with black polish. Don't think I have done them for over a year, crikey!  I went down the town this afternoon, I thought I might buy a waterproof jacket for walking. I looked in all the charity shops but couldn't find any. It's a bit of a pain to put on a plastic mac everytime a shower comes. I looked in Millets, too dear, I looked in another shop which had 'Sale' signs in the window. I tried a few on, and found a lightweight grey and black jacket, which was reduced from \u00a340 to \u00a320. I didn't want a fleecy lining because I wear lots of layers anyway. This jacket is ideal, waterproof, breathable, and windproof. Just the job.  I had a look in Pets At Home to see if they had Felix As Good As It Looks, on special offer. They had, but there was none left on the shelf, I was disappointed. Then I looked round the corner in the next aisle, and found a big stack of them. I was chuffed to little mintballs. I got six boxes of 48 pouches for \u00a360. To buy this amount in boxes of 12 pouches from a supermarket at the normal price would have cost \u00a3104.40, so a massive saving there. That's me stocked up for a long time.  Anyway, it's been nice chatting, but I have got to get my things ready for tomorrow. I'm off to North Yorkshire in the morning, for three days. I shall be exploring just north of Pickering tomorrow, then moving on to Boggle Hole Youth Hostel, near Robin Hoods Bay on the coast, for two nights. My plan is to walk part of the Cleveland Way, and possibly venture onto the moors. Have a nice weekend, I'll catch you soon."}, {"title": "Doggy paddle", "date": "Friday 26 February 2010", "text": "Ben dog went for a swim today, we have a hydro therapy unit at the kennels, here in the village. Ben's back legs are becoming unsteady, he is thirteen now, and Flora his owner is hoping the excercise will help his muscle tone. I have noticed his gradual slowing down in the four years I have been walking him, we don't do hills any more, just a steady plod and a sniff about. Here he is getting his life jacket on. This is the fourth session of a course of ten weekly visits.He was a little bit nervous on the approach down the ramp into the water, but Jimmy coaxed him gently in. When he first came he only had three, one minute swims, now he has three two and a half minute swims, with a rest in between each one. Jimmy is constantly massaging his back legs under the water.After the first swim he was panting a bit, but after a rest he soon started to relax and enjoy it. I hadn't noticed that my camera lens had steamed up, apologies for the misty photo's.Now it's time to get out and he rests for a few minutes on the ramp, all the time Jimmy is reassuring him with a lot of, 'Good Boys'. At the top of the ramp his back end collapses in a heap because of all the extra weight he is carrying with his coat full of water.He waits for a few minutes before he descends the second ramp to the drying area. Off with the life jacket and a rinse down before the shampoo and conditioner is applied. More rinsing and on with the hairdryer, he also has a good brush to removed the matted fur.He was so good throughout the whole operation. I took him home in my car because it was pouring with rain. The weather was too miserable to take a photo of the finished article, so here is one I took earlier. Last year on a walk across the fields.

It's taking shape nicely but still a long way to go. I am naming it The Mountain, it's a sculpture in fabric.In between the showers I went out for some excercise. Remember my gym, the hill? I walked up and down it six times, no not all at once. Up and down twice is all I can manage in one go without stopping, then I need a rest. As it's so close to home I can nip out, it takes 20 minutes to do it once. It sure does warm me up, haven't put the heating on at all today.I'm just back from the Arts Centre at Barton, I've been to see a film called Creation. It was a story about Charles Darwin. Before the film started there was a speaker from Hull University talking about the differences between the Darwin in the film, and the real life Darwin. He had ten children altogether though the film only showed five. He was torn between the love for his deeply religious wife and his own belief in a world where God has no place. It was a very emotional film, as he struggled to accept his daughters death.I quite enjoy going out to watch a film now and again, it's a cheap night at \u00a33 and I don't buy anything else. I can never find any decent films at the cinema in town, but I have several marked off in the Arts Centre brochure to see. Goodnight sleep tight."}, {"title": "What a boring post", "date": "Wednesday 24 February 2010", "text": "Well, my gas bill has provoked a lot of interest, thanks for sharing your views. Now that I have actually studied the bill I dont feel quite so peeved. Apparently the price of one kwh came down part  way through the bill period, and I was using the heating at the coldest time, which was also the most expensive time. So the bills from now on will be going down as the temperature starts rising. Today it already feels a little warmer and I dont need to put the heating on. There is a little chart on the bill comparing how much gas I used in the last three months, with the same period last year. A year ago I only had the gas fire in the living room, there is a big difference to this year, it has shot up.I don't have a problem with quarterly bills, as long as I have an idea how much they might be. In fact I would rather not have to be bothered with monthly bills, it seems as soon as one payment is made the next month comes round almost immediately. Four times a year would be ideal for me to pay all my bills, as long as they dont all come on the same four months. It would be a sort of rota, then you could work your household budget out for the whole year.A few years ago I would find that my bank balance had plumeted to a dangerously low level on several ocassions, when work was either not forthcoming, or I couldn't be bothered to do any. I was hanging on by the skin of my teeth at times, wondering what I could sell to make a few bob. Of course something always turned up and rescued me from the mire. I always made sure there was enough to cover the mortgage, that was priority.Anyway, back to the price of gas. I had a look at the British Gas web site, (thankyou dancingonabladeofgrass),read up on energy smart, and I don't get the point of it. Perhaps it might be usefull to a large family when the teenage kids all want to play their computer games, and you need to nag them about the cost of electricity, but it would be no use to me at all. Apparently the gadget tells you how much electricity you are using at any one time, I can't see how that can save you money.What do you do with it, plug a few things in and watch the number rise, then think about what you can do without, and pull a few plugs out? You can do that anyway without the gadget. Common sense tells you if you are going to have an electrical appliance plugged into every socket of the house it is going to cost you a fortune and your bill will go sky high. As far as I can see the only way you can save money on utilities is to either reduce your consumption, or the companies  drop their prices.My goodness what a boring post this is, let's get onto something a bit more light hearted for tomorrow :-)"}, {"title": "Global warming, bring it on!", "date": "Tuesday 23 February 2010", "text": "I've had a bit of a shock today, the quarterly gas bill arrived. When my central heating didn't work it was so easy, I just managed without it. No questions, no worrying about whether I could afford to switch it on. No central heating, end of story.  I didn't mind receiving a gas bill, because I knew I wasn't going to get any nasty surprises. Every time I opened one I smiled, that will do nicely, I thought.But now that the government has very kindly fixed my heating for me, my bill has shot up to \u00a396.89 from the \u00a352.90 it was for the same period last year. They said, get a new energy efficient boiler and watch your bills go down. Well mine flippin well hasn't, it's gone up! I knew it would be too easy to flick the switch when I felt the slightest bit chilly. I knew I would become a whimp and give in. Well this has got to stop. I can't be doing with the uncertainty of these fluctuating bills, I want to get back to the old method of not using it and not paying for it.I know you can pay by direct debit and spread the cost, but from what I have heard the gas and electricity people always set the monthly payments quite high so that you are always paying more than you need to. Eventually you end up with quite a sizeable amount in your credit pot. I am not going to get into that situation, lending British Gas my money so they can invest it and make a profit. Better that it's in my purse, and I will pay for what I have used.That's another thing, I try and keep my direct debits to a minimum, I don't like the idea of people helping themselves from my bank account. Whenever possible I pay my bills as and when they arrive, that way it feels like I am paying with real money. It helps me to keep track of things, my bank statements are usually only one page because there is very little activity, makes it easier to spot anything untoward. With a bit of luck, with all this global warming going on we won't be needing central heating, then everybody will be in the same boat, hot and sweaty :-)"}, {"title": "Aha, there is a road outside my house!", "date": "Monday 22 February 2010", "text": "My mucky windows were starting to bug me a bit, cleaning them is a job I hate, along with most other household chores. The easy way would be to get a window cleaner, but I am far too mean to pay for someone to do a job I am perfectly capable of doing myself. Only the elderly, infirm, or those with upstairs windows that they cannot reach, and the filthy rich who live in mansions, should have a window cleaner. I must have saved loads of money over the years by cleaning my own windows. I don't suppose it is such a big chore after all when I come to think about it. They don't get done until I cant see out of them, and that is only two or three times a year, so I don't know what I am moaning about. I used to faff around with cheap spray cleaners made for windows, or water and proper window cloths, aren't you supposed to put vinegar in the bowl? All far too messy. Now I just cut up an old teashirt which is ready for the rag bag, and get my trusty Pledge from under the sink. I don't have a rag bag actually, I wear my clothes till I start looking like a tramp:-) Anyway, this morning I cleaned the two upstairs front windows. Luckily they have the sort of openings that you can hang out of and reach the outside. My goodness, they were filthy. I don't think I have done the ledges for several years, I don't know what people thought as they walked by. They are now clean. I know aerosols are not good for the planet, but this is the only one I have in my house, and as I use it sparingly and very rarely get it out, it lasts ages.

I wanted to know how to work out the distances I walk, and some kind member pointed me in the right direction of a really good web site. I can mark out the route on a map with the mouse, and hey presto it comes up with the mileage. Yesterday I walked 9.5 miles. And today I have walked 5.25 miles into town, I didn't think it was as far as that. It takes me 1 hour 40 minutes, which is about right for the average of 3 mph.Anyway, I am going to go back over my previous walks and start logging my miles. It will be interesting to work out some totals, maybe for the week or month. I can see this spurring me on to do longer walks, and maybe walk a bit faster.I bought another OS map from W H Smiths, and while I was in there I spotted a special offer on Cadbury's chocolate 140g. They were 80p each or two for \u00a31. I thought that was a good buy so treated myself to two bars, one for now, and one for later. Then I had an idea. I usually give my next door neighbour some chocolate for feeding my cats when I am away, so I bought another 8 bars for \u00a34.I have started to eat one bar, well I did buy it for myself, but I have put the other nine bars in the fridge, to save for John next door, and Janet my friend who also comes in. I may have set myself an impossible task here, not to touch the chocolate in the fridge. I wonder how long I will last before I cave in? To be honest I would find climbing a mountain a lot easier than keeping my mits off the choccy, it's going to be one hell of a challenge.

It was a sunny start so I thought let's get off for a walk, checked my maps and picked out an area just off the M1 motorway junction 37 north of Shefield. There seems to be plenty of footpaths to do a circular walk, starting at Silkstone.It wasn't long before I found myself on a very long bridleway which was a sea of mud. Oh well, I thought, maybe it will get better further on. Wrong! It seems every way I turned I was paddling through boggy fields or slipping around on muddy paths. Instead of a pleasant stroll through the beautiful countryside I have been on an army assault course. I now feel fit and able to join the lads on their next mission. I have taken a few photo's, not a lot, I'm sure you all know what a boggy field looks like.This is Silkstone Church, it sits high up on a huge piece of land, at the crossroads in the centre of the village. I went inside and found two guys putting books out ready for the coffee and book sale tomorrow. They were very chatty and told me a few interesting stories about the history of the village. This stile is an example of health and safety gone mad. The stone steps up and over the wall are all that's needed and have been around for hundreds of years. This design can be seen all over the place. Some bright spark has decided that a wooden frame needs to be built around it with hand rails, presumably so that us incompetant walkers don't fall off.This is Cannon Hall, a big stately home near Cawthorne. There was a wedding party having their photographs taken.This is the river that runs through Cannon Hall Country Park.And some of the birds that live there.There is also a Cannon Hall Farm which I came to after passing through some fields of sheep. It must have been feeding time, because a farm worker turned up on his quad bike with a trailer, and started dropping piles of feed . It was ever so funny, the sheep were chasing him as he went from one field to another. The farm buildings were surrounded by high fences and had notices up saying no entry at the back, because there is an entry fee to pay. I passed by the front driveway ten minutes later and the sign said \u00a34.95 per car. I suppose that is quite reasonable if you can squash about a dozen in your car :-) As usual I over estimated the distance I thought I could cover in the time, and ended up doing the last bit on the road.

I was one of those pupils who hid at the back of the class and hoped I wouldn't be picked on by the teacher. I was never going to be an academic, and couldn't wait to walk out of those gates for the last time. My learning came to a halt when I was fifteen.Now I have a new teacher, Radio 4. It's like having a lesson in my own living room when I tune in, I can be getting on with my crafting and still learn something new as I sew, knit, and crochet. The programmes cover such a wide variety of subjects, I think of it as food for the brain, so I am trying to make sure I get enough nutrition in that department. Use it or lose it is what they say.I start off by listening in to the Today programme, a magazine of world news. Sometimes it gets a bit too heavy with political matters or world affairs, but overall it is pretty balanced.A few of my favourites are:-From Our Own Correspondent, introduced by Kate Adie. These are stories from behind the headlines from BBC correspondents, often with an unusual slant on the subject.You and Yours, a consumer programme on every day from 12 o clock. Lots of usefull information here about consumer matters.Costing the Earth. This is about what consumerism is doing to the planet, global warming, over polulation, and what we should be doing about it. A little bit of nature, a little bit of science.Material World is along similar lines as Costing the Earth. Again very thought provoking.The Bottom Line. Evan Davis presents this business programme. I am interested in all aspects of business.Desert Island Discs. I sometimes listen to this depending on who is the castaway.Last Word. This is an obituary programme about people who have passed away in the last week. I find other people's lives fascinating.Case Notes. Mark Porter explores medical matters. Well we all need to know how our bodies work.Taking a Stand. Fascinating programme about how people have made a decision which has had a profound effect on their lives. The resilience of some people who have the strength to pull through is astounding.File on 4. An indepth investicative programme on a variety of issues.In Touch presented by Peter White. An informative programme on blindness, interesting even if you are not blind.Beyond Belief. A look at religion from a different angle.The Food Programme. It tells about what is going on behind the scenes of food production and consumption. Something we all should be taking note of.Excess Baggage. Adventures, frustrations, and joys of travel, with a lot of humourBlimey, I could go on, that's rather a long list there isn't it.

There was about seventy in the large room so I had to use the pa system. I really get a buzz with a microphone in my hand, and in no time I had them falling about laughing. They were such a jolly crowd, it makes the job so easy. Afterwards people came up to me and said how much they enjoyed it.Just as I was packing away, a very nice gentleman asked if I would care to join them for lunch. Well I could hardly refuse could I, hearing the words, 'I'll treat you', swung it for me. So for my free lunch I had cheese and broccoli bake, chips, peas and salad, and for pudding I had treacle sponge and custard. It was lovely.

He has been going back to his previous house, apparently he likes the greenhouse there. Don't know why because there is hardly any glass in it. Anyway, Sue went to look for him and there he was, so she rang Janet who came with her car and a crate, and they took him back to Sue's house. He is now in a cat chalet.He is beginning to lok a bit scruffy, his beautiful long hair is becoming matted around his neck, and his bottom. This is the fifth time he has run away from home now, even though his owners have tried to keep him there. For some reason he does a runner, and we don't know where he has been getting his food from. Possibly the mouse population has shrunk in the village. Sue gave him two sachets of cat food which he quickly demolished. I think the owners will have to consider re homeing him, unless they move back to where they lived before. He needs to find somewhere that he is happy to stay. Sue is hinting that he would be very happy at my house, she is not listening to me when I say I don't want anymore commitments. He is lovely though. During these cold days, I am not in a hurry to go out very early, except if I have a days walking planned. Mostly I have a leisurely start, up between 7.30 amd 8am, sit at the dining room table overlooking the garden, eating my breakfast, listening to the radio, and planning my days activities. Ahhh, the joys of retirement :-)The sun always comes up over the back from the left hand side and travels across behind the row of silver birch in the next garden, then after lunch time moves around the side of the house to the front. In the summer I have to close one of the curtains as I sit there and daydream, as it is too bright. This morning the sun was cheekily peeping out from behind some very moody clouds drifting along in the breeze. I just had to capture the image.Fabulous, isn't it! How often do we take these things for granted. The sun will rise, it will move across the sky, and it will disappear over the horizon.  How often do we dismiss these sights as normal and carry on with what we were doing, and how often do we look but don't see? It only takes a minute for a stunning view like this to reveal itself, and in another minute it will be gone forever. How amazing is that! And if we weren't paying attention, if we were so engrossed in our own little world, wrapped up in our own worries and anxieties, we would have missed out on many beautiful sights that present themselves every minute of every day. The best part is that we don't have to go anywhere to appreciate natural beauty, it is all around us. We only have to open our eyes."}, {"title": "Pampering my feet", "date": "Monday 15 February 2010", "text": "I think I had better start looking after me feet, after all if I am to go off trekking at every opportunity I'm going to need a couple of happy plates of meat. What I would really like is to treat myself to a lovely relaxing pedicure by some professionally trained person, but that is most unlikely because the cost of it would be more than I could bear. So what's the next best thing? A frugal diy pedicure, my mum used to do this all the time. First of all gather up all the bits and pieces you will need. I had a look in the back of my bathroom cabinet and found some Deodorising Lemongrass Foot Spray and a bottle of Peppermint Leg Cooling Gel, left over from my Bodyshop consultancy job about eight years ago. I did this work for a while so I could get my toiletries at hugely discounted prices. Next I need some implements to scrape, and scrub, and cut toe nails. I love those sponges with a rough bumpy side, my whole body gets cleaned with one of those, face as well, ouch! A pumice stone for the hard skin, and sharp scissors for my nails. I know you are not supposed to cut them into the corners but I always do, and I have never had ingrowing toenails. A fluffy towel out of the airing cupboard will be needed. To finish off the treatment I have a selection of moisturising creams in sachets. As I mentioned before, these were given to me as part of a bag of usefull stuff. All I have to do is decide whether to use the Hydrofirming Night Treatment Cream, the Comforting Moisture Cream, or the Biologie Skin Optimizer, what the heck is that for? As I am not going to bed yet, I choose the Comforting Cream. Nearly ready, boil a kettle full of water, and lay a towel on the floor in front of a comfortable arm chair. A nice bowl of hot soapy water to soak my feet in. Washing up liquid for me, it does the job and is cheap, but you can use any old soap. Time to relax and close my eyes while I swish about. My Andrea Bocelli cd is perfect for these daydreaming moments. When you are scrubbed clean up to your knees, and the hard bits smoothed with the stone, dry your legs and wrap your feet in the towel. A trim with the scissors should be easy now the nails are nice and soft.Finish off with a foot massage, I use generous squirts and splashes of creams and lotions, all the way up to my knees. If you are going to be wearing sandals you might like to paint your nails. I can't be bothered with that sort of thing so I just slip on a clean pair of socks and my feet feel warm and snug. I am going to pamper my feet more often, they deserve it. I must have saved about thirty quid today."}, {"title": "No smiles from Henry", "date": "Sunday 14 February 2010", "text": "I've been a bit tied up with Henry for a couple of days, another sleepover. He is a gorgeous fella. Although he was hard work a few months back, he appears to have passed his naughty stage, and is now just a bit cheeky. He has made me laugh this weekend with his antics. Lilly cat has has his face washed several times with Henry's big sloppy wet pink tongue. My dirty socks have been dragged out of the laundry bin and used as a play toy. The carpet has been pulled up at the top of the stairs. I was reading in bed last night and the big lump jumped up and trashed the covers, eventually settling down to sleep on my feet.It's so funny when we are out walking, he stops dead when he sees someone, and just stares at them. We stood for ages on the street corner while he was people watching, I should have taken a fold up chair with me.He went at 5pm today, and I felt a bit sad, never mind I shall be seeing him again no doubt. Trying to get a good photo of Henry is not easy. He will not smile for the camera."}, {"title": "Holmfirth, again. Not the touristy bit.", "date": "Saturday 13 February 2010", "text": "It was a toss up today whether to go on a mega bus ride, or chat with the sheep in West Yorkshire. The sheep won. I arrived at Holmfirth at midday and began my walk with a fairly steep climb out of the town, it wasn't long before I was peeling layers off. A bit of huffing and puffing with the old ticker quickening it's pace has got to be doing me some good. I have already done the touristy bit of this 'Last Of The Summer Wine country', now to explore the rest.It seems every road out of Holmfirth has an incline. How they managed to cram all those houses into such steep and minute plots never ceases to amaze me. It's interesting to stroll by peering into someones back yard when their roof is the same level as the footpath. Here are two photo's of the first views I saw.While a lot of dry stone walls are neglected and crumbling I was most impressed with this neat and tidy example. I have no idea how long it has been standing but I would say it is good for a few more hundred years. The square slate like slabs were perfectly placed, I can't see that it will ever fall down. It's a pity these ancient skills are not taught to the youth of today, because when the human race has blown itself into oblivion we will need to start all over again. I joined the Kirklees Way, a designated leisure footpath promoted by the local council, and was pleasantly surprised at how interesting it was. A bit of allsorts really, I love trees of any kind. I like to incorporate a walk around or alongside some water in my travels, and had planned it so I pass a couple of reservoirs. I came down a steep bank to the Brownhill Reservoir, the map clearly indicates a crossing at this point. Unfortunately this was the sight that greeted me, a building site, the path was closed untill the spring. Not the sort of thing you expect to come across in the beautiful countryside, but I suppose they have to do this work to ensure that we enjoy continual clean water at the turn of a tap. Not to worry, there is another crossing half a mile further along, and this is it. You can see the footpath I took over the little bridge and along the top of the slope. On the other side I heard the sound of the rushing water as it cascaded down the overflow channel from the higher level to the lower. Further along the path I looked back to see this great view, it always pays to stop and look behind you, you might miss something.This photo is taken looking back at the path I have just come down, still part of the Kirklees Way.And what should I come across but a lovely little waterfall with a rather ugly iron footbridge crossing the water. It was a beautiful woodland scene, very pleasant when you are the only person there. Couldn't resist taking more photo's.I arrived in Holme village, after passing a house which was hidden underground. It was like one of those you see on Grand Designs, the only clues to it's existance was a glass dome and several glass bubbles poking up from the neatly planted camourflage. I couldn't get any pictures because of the high banks that surrounded the structure, obviously the owner values their privacy. This rather splendid building on the roadside is for sale if you fancy buying it.This is a photo of Digly Reservoir, another water feature I passed on my way back. The darkness was beginning to descend, my day was almost over. It was a race against time to get back to the car, so the last half an hour was along the roadside. Something I hate doing but it makes no sense to stumble around in the dark on uneven ground. I like to make the most of every minute so often find myself trying to cram too much in the day, roll on lighter nights. One last shot, of this dramatic sky."}, {"title": "I've had the snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip", "date": "Thursday 11 February 2010", "text": "I try and limit my visits to the hairdresser, not because I am too meant to pay, well ok I don't want to pay very much, but because it is so damn boring in there. I wait untill I absolutely have to go, usually after I have chopped lumps off and it is starting to look a bit odd. I can manage the top and the sides, but I struggle a bit with the back.I hate sitting there while someone fiddles about with my hair, combing, lifting and separating, clipping it up out of the way, trimming my fringe, pushing my head this way and that, bits of hair floating around my face and landing on my eyelashes and in my mouth. I hate looking at myself in the mirror so it's just as well I can take my specs off so I can't see how awful I look with flat wet hair. I hate anyone else seeing me in this unglamorous state as well.Then the hairdresser starts making conversation, and I can't hear her because I have taken my hearing aid out. I just smile and say yes to everything, and hopes she gets on with the job pretty sharpish so I can be out of there. I don't know why some women like going to the hairdressers, I wish I could take my head off and just leave it there and go back for it later.Anyway, I had my haircut today, there is a new shop just opened in town, big signs on the window with the prices, \u00a35 for an oap trim, that will do me. The girl did more chatting than cutting, I was in a rush but she kept rabbiting on and I couldn't hear a word of it. Then she got the hairdryer out and blow dried it, which it didn't need it was almost dry anyway. I said how lovely it was when she positioned the miror round the back of my head. I paid my \u00a35 and as I was leaving I said, 'see you again'.

I came away with lots of candles, lots of sachets of moisturising creams, a bag of fabric for my sewing projects, insoles for my boots, a lovely silk blouse, and a few other bits and bobs. A very nice haul indeed.We took Henry dog a walk, he was so excited to see me again. He will be coming for his sleepover on Saturday, but we have strict instructions not to do a two hour walk. We must only do several shorter walks, because Henry has started limping a little bit. He is such an energetic dog, but he tends to overdo the dashing about.I spent a bit of money today, I got the Dyson out and sucked the dust out of the carpets. I'm not sure how much an hour of Dysoning costs, but it needed doing, I got fed up of the place being knee high in cat hairs. Cleaning the stairs is a job I hate, but I can just about put up with it twice a year, ha ha. My latest Tesco vouchers arrived this morning, I now have a grand total of  \u00a339 in the pot. They sent a Rewards catalogue as well so I had a look to see what I might treat myself to. I could fly to Paris and back. I could have a Thornton Chocoholic Hamper. I could get an annual pass to visit ten attractions as many times as I like in the year. I could have a years membership of English Heritage.

I know I could close the door to keep other non resident cats out, but this time I wanted the cat to come so I could see who the culprit was.At 10pm I gave up and closed the door. For the previous two nights food has been eaten, and guess what, tonight food has gone again and I don't know who came in for it because I wasn't watching. Do I just close the door now and give up, or do I carry on watching?The reason for my detective work? Mr Beasley, the big ginger puss has gone missing again. We found his owners for him when he was lost a few weeks ago, they came to pick him up. He was kept in for a couple of weeks so he would know where he lives, but then he went walkabout back to his old home. The owners found him and took him back for another spell of confinement.

We had a bit of a catch up work wise, I still like to talk shop even though I have been out of it for a while. Interesting to find out how things have changed in the last year and a half. He told me about his biking and I told him about my walking, and suddenly he jumped up and said, 'I've got just the thing for you,' and disappeared out to his car. When he came back he handed me this.A lovely pair of gloves with matching hat. He had them for Christmas and didn't need them as he has loads.

Some need to be large, others are ok in small. I generally make everything large, cause that's how I am, bold and brassy and shout it from the rooftops type. There's still a lot to learn from this blogging, I need to look into the nuts and bolts of it, all a learning curve I suppose. Anyway, that fiddling about has taken a good part of the day up, but at least I got there eventually. I increased the size of some of the photo's but you can still click on them to make them gigantic if you should so choose. Please don't look too closely at my wrinkly mush, ha ha. I must get on with something else and get off this computer for a while. The garden needs tidying, the bin men are collecting the brown bin tomorrow so I will go out and cut a few trees down, only joking, trimming a few shrubs will do.

Here is a couple of pics to start you guessing.Take a round piece of foam, 8 inches diameter and 5 and a half inches deep. Take an electric carving knife and slice pieces off the sides, making it into a cone shape, it doesn't have to be perfect.That's it. It's going to be a complicated piece like the rock pool, so you will have to be patient, it will take a while. I have a picture in my mind of how I want it to turn out, and I'm going to look pretty silly if I make a hash of it. The inspiration comes from my walking.

I left home at 9.40am on Wednesday and met my sister and her husband at Bedale, a few miles from the A1 in North Yorkshire. They are staying in their caravan near Stokesley on the edge of the North Yorkshire Moors, and came across to meet me. We found Panetti's, a cosy little Bistro where we had lunch, this is me, Bryn, and Anna Maria.After a walk round we parted company, and I carried on a few miles further to Leyburn. I have wanted to visit this small town for years, ever since I delivered cement to a quarry there. It was just as I remembered it, a charming Dales town full of character. Then it was time to go to the hostel. The road is quite narrow and twisty and passes large areas of moorland which are out of bounds to everyone except the military who do a lot of their training there. Best not to wander into it in case you get shot at. It had started to snow and after a couple of miles it was getting quite heavy and settling on the road. I was down to a crawl in some places. I couldn't see the edges of the road. Thank goodness I came across the hostel before it got too dangerous, I was pleased to see the huge castle like building come into view, partially hidden in the trees.I checked in and found I had the place to myself, just me and the warden. I had my own room with four beds to choose from, and numerous shower and toilet facilities. I had the kitchen to myself and after I cooked my own dinner I had control over the television remote all night long. A real fire in the grate and a can of cider, it was heaven.This is Grinton Lodge, I took a photo of the poster on the wall. It was built at the centre of a large shooting estate in 1817, by James Fenton of Doncaster, a mansion with outhouses and stables set in gardens with wonderful views of the surrounding moorlands. It changed hands several times and had extensive alterations in 1880 for it's disabled owner to enable wheelchair access. The lodge was sold with 5 acres of land to the YHA for \u00a35,500 in 1948. I wonder what it's worth now.This is the sight that greeted me when I set off the next morning with my backpack and my map. This path is opposite the hostel, no footprints, just rabbit paw prints in the snow. It wasn't long before I came to a deep and slippery slope down to a stream.And a climb up the other side. You can see it is quite misty. Into Grinton village, this is St Michaels Church. I took a footpath alongside the river, then veered off to the right through the fields heading towards Cuckoo Hill. If you look at the skyline in the next picture you can see the snow at the top of Fremington Edge, I am hoping to climb up there. A breather half way up and a chance to look down and admire the view. There is a lot of mist hanging in the sky, and the sun is trying to come out. Oh well, set off again, still a fair bit to go. A bit further to go, stop for another breather. The weather is changing by the minute, the sun is trying to make a show on the left, the wind is swirling the mist, sometimes you can see for miles, then the view is hidden.Another stop before the top, the view is so magnificent I sit on a rock and take a few minutes to take in the gloriousness of it. You can just see the barn on the left hand side of this picture that was in the shot at the start of the climb. This is better than flying.At last, the pile of stones indicates I have made it. That last few hundred yards was rather difficult, a vast shelf of frozen snow to cross with no obvious foot holes, I could have done with some crampons. But once you get so far there is no giving up and going back. I know to some experienced climbers that this would have been a mere stroll in the park, but to me it was a wonderful opportunity for a challenge. The sense of achievement I felt made me beam with pleasure, and the rewards are a stunning view. Well worth the effort. At the top I turned left and walked along the edge for about an hour, the mist was coming down very fast so my views were totally lost and I was walking on a ridge of snow alongside a wall with the moors on my right, and very little vision in any direction. Eventually I came to the point when I had to start my descent, the mist cleared a bit as I went down. It wasn't obvious where the footpath was, but thankfully the kind walkers before me had built little piles of stones to mark the way. I eventually got down to the bottom at Langthwaite, and turned left to follow the Arkle Beck back to the hostel. Time was getting on, and at one point I lost the footpath. It was becoming quite difficult along the waters edge, the erosion of the soil, due to possibly snow and rain, and walkers boots, had left all the tree roots exposed. I was literally stumbling about which was taking it's toll on my feet. I noticed a lot of branches that had fallen or been blown from the trees had been stripped of their bark, I thought that was strange. I also noticed that there were a lot of dead rabbits about, probably hundreds of them, also very strange. It was time I was getting off this rough ground and onto the road before it got dark, a race against the clock. Eventually I came to the road at High Fremington, and knew that I could easily get back to the hostel along the road from there.Day three. A drizzly start to the day so waterproof gear needed. I headed towards Grinton on the road and came across a pleasant little footpath alongside a stream. There was a poster in the hostel that said Market Day in Reeth on a Friday, so I went to explore. It's a gorgeous little village. This is the Babtist church.It was a very small market because it is early in the year. I had a chat to two of the stall holders who said how much they enjoyed coming and it definately was worth the effort to get up early and travel the long distances, because the same regular customers came every week. This tiny cobbled street with it's pretty cottages is typical of many Dales villages. I had a look round the craft workshops and had a chat with a very friendly artist who makes animal sculptures. I asked him if he could shed any light on the dead rabbits. His explanation was that they have had three weeks of snow and the rabbits wont have been able to find any food so they have just died. He said that would also explain the trees without the bark as they would have been desperate to eat anything. Also the burrows would have been flooded. I felt very sad that all those bunnies have died, but I suppose that is the law of nature. I thought I would have a spell of easy walking along the road to give my feet a rest. There was a lot of baa baa noises coming from the fields as I was passing, so I stopped to talk to the sheep. They seemed curious and all came strolling towards me bleating incessantly. It was so funny, I had to take a photo.I was watching the time, this walk won't be as long as yesterdays because of the time I spent in Reeth, but I wanted to make the best of every minute and not get back too early, so I took a diversion up a steep track at Healaugh. My goodness it was very short and very steep, I had to peel off a couple of layers I was so hot. I passed by a lovely big house and had a chat to the two gentlemen in the garden, they pointed out the track back to the road past Thiernswood Hall, a big stately home.Back on the road, I eventually I came to a junction and turned left over a bridge. I turned left again and continued along a tarmac track. A short way along there I had the option of dropping down onto the edge of the river Swale, or keep on the track back to Grinton. I chose the river walk.The river is quite fast flowing here. It looks as if the path might have been washed into the river at some time, because it has been repaired with large rocks. After a few bends the path leaves the river for a while, it eventually returns and you see this wooden footbridge. It looks quite spectacular from a distance but close up it looks like a miniature version of the Humber Bridge. It would look quite at home in a theme park.I walked back to the hostel over the fields rather than the road. Quite an impressive building don't you think.If you've got this far well done, thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed it."}, {"title": "A lot of walking", "date": "Friday 5 February 2010", "text": "I'm back and I've had a fab time.

I am addicted to it, every time I see a stile, and footpath sign pointing across a field I have an uncontrollable urge to go and see where it leads to. Even when I drive around, I want to stop and have a look. I suppose being nosey helps, I like to find out things, meet people, ask questions, it all adds to the tapestry of life.

The hostel is an old shooting lodge, it looks a very interesting old building with lots of history.I bought an ordnance survey map of the area this morning, and I have a couple of books out of the library which have interesting routes to follow.

I thought I would wait untill this morning to indulge in a little relaxing water therapy. It seems so much more heavenly to bath on a weekday morning, and remember the times when I used to be up and out on the road at 4am. Such bliss to lie and dream about the week and months ahead, making plans.This year I want to go out more, see places before I die. I dream of wandering around Scotland, the south coast, the Scilly Isles, the south west, the Yorkshire Dales, and many more wonderful places. So what do I need to do to achieve these goals? For a start I need to find someone reliable who will come in and feed my cats, I don't think they would do well in a cattery, even though my friend runs a top class establishment. I'm going to ask a few people close by and offer some payment for the service, that way it is ok to ask several times. After three years of growing my own veg, I am going to scale it down a bit for this year, just grow a few things that need very little maintenance. In the past I have faffed about looking after my precious seedlings through wind and rain. This year they will have to fend for themselves. Right, that's the plan, I still need to be frugal though to pay for my holidays, so I had better carry on with my money saving.

With the nights being very cold at the moment, and me not having a human hot water bottle, I thought I might redesign my bedmaking to make it more snug and cosy. My electric blanket was chucked a few months ago, before the house went up in flames, and has not been replaced, so I need an alternative method to keep warm.The flat surface of a bed does not lend itself to the contours of the human body. I know you can get such things as a memory mattress or a memory topper to put over the existing mattress, but I cannot see how these can work if you are constantly changing your position while you sleep. They would not keep up with my tossing and turning, the memory bit would have to be re programmed every week.So I need to introduce some lumps and bumps into my bed, this is a much cheaper alternative as long as you already have the necessary components.Step 1, put a sheet on first, you could skip this if you don't have a sheet as it is not really necessary.Step 2, you need a fluffed up feather duvet in a cover on next, any old cover would do.Step 3, next put on another fluffed up duvet in a nice cover because you are going to sleep on top of that. Step 4, Next add the pillows. You can have as many as you like. I have three under my head, (I might move one of these elsewhere during the night), and I put one half way down the bed because I lie mainly on my back and the slight elevation under my knees is more comfortable for my hips and back. When I turn on my side I put this pillow between my knees, supporting the upper leg slightly, a more natural position. Single people could have an extra pillow for hugging. You can experiment till you get it right.Step 5, cover the whole thing with a big duvet in a nice cover because this is the one you are going to sleep underneath.Step 6, then add another duvet in any old cover.Step 7, finish off with a throw. If you don't have pets on the bed you could possibly manage without this, but put the top duvet in a pretty cover.To sum up, this is the basic recipe, you can adjust it to use whatever ingredients you have to hand. Feather duvets are best, it makes a cosier nest, but fibre ones will also do the job. Don't think you will have to do a lot more washing, you only need to wash the covers which are next to your body, the others can be washed maybe once a month. I have been sleeping in my nest for a few weeks now, it is so lovely I don't want to get out in the morning. Think of the electricity I am saving by not having an electric blanket. Are you going to have a go at making your own nest? Of course you will be a lot warmer if you don't take all your clothes off at night, ha ha :-)"}, {"title": "Stanage Edge", "date": "Saturday 30 January 2010", "text": "Oh dear, I hope I'm not going to bore the pants off you with another walk, if you don't want to see it look away now, ha ha. Today was lovely and sunny so I got myself sorted, made my pack up, and set off for Hathersage in derbyshire. I have been there before but wanted to try another walk because it is so lovely there. I arrived at 11am and parked near the church. I wanted to explore Stanage Edge, a line of craggy rocks high up, with great views.There seemed to be quite a few walkers about, that's not a good sign, I like to wander off on my own, just me and my map. Not a lot of snow left, except for up on the hills where it was frozen hard. It wasn't long before I had to stop and strip off, I always start with too many clothes on then get a sweat on when I am climbing. I had a pair of lightweight trousers on and underneath a pair of jog bottoms, and under that a pair of leggins. Well the leggins had to come off, and of course I had to take my boots off for that, so there's me hopping around in the woods hoping no one comes along. I had just finished when one man and his dog strolled by. I came to a wood called Dennis Knoll, there is a car park there, and I looked up the track towards Stanage Edge, it was like the M1 motorway I had just driven on, there was that many people they needed traffic lights. I decided to go in the other direction and look for another path across the moors and meet the Edge a bit further up. I found the stile ok, the path wasn't very obvious so I hoped I was going in the right direction. I got to a disused quarry, it must have closed many years ago because mother nature had been reclaiming the land. The view was fantastic, very difficult to take a photo though because half of it was in the shade. It was a lovely spot to have lunch, it feels very spiritual when you are by yourself amongst the massive rocks, and the erm....sheep droppings, ha ha. I set off in the direction I thought was right, but there was no sign of a path. I decided to go back to the road because I didn't want them to have to get mountain rescue out for me if I was still up there after dark. I went back to Dennis Knoll, not quite so many people about now so I set off towards the Edge. Here are a few snaps. Through the gate into The WarrenThe wooden bridge over the streamThe disused quarryCan you see me waving to youClimbing up to the EdgeYou can see the Edge along the skyline The path is under the snow at this pointThe view from the topIt's a popular spot for climbersIt looks like you could push this rock off the edgeThis is on the top of Stanage Edge Another view from the top, it doesn't look very steep but it is a sheer drop. The path is very well worn, many cyclists, runners, and walkers use it. I actually prefer to get off the beaten track, but I need to improve my map reading skills for that. There are a lot more places you can walk now, and some of them are not very obvious, you need a map and a compass to explore them. The scenery on our island is wonderful, so much to see and so little time."}, {"title": "How much ! ! !", "date": "Friday 29 January 2010", "text": "I was up a bit earlier this morning, with a plan to go walking, but one look out of the window put me right off, dull, overcast, and damp. I thought I would give it an hour to see if it brightened up. After breakfast it was still the same, so I thought it had better be plan B then, the bus to Hull, that's Kingston upon Hull if you're posh. At least I can walk around in the warm there, even though shopping centres are not my idea of fun.Just as I set off, the sun came out, how can you ever make plans for anything with such fickle weather like this. It was flippin freezing cold, sunny one minute and a snowy blizzard the next. I had to tie my scarf over my head, caught sight of myself in a shop window, what an awful sight, just like Olive from On the Buses, ha ha.I was looking for charity shops but only found three, and they were way too posh for me, so no bargains there then. The only way I could warm up was to walk around big shops. I thought about going in a coffee shop for a warm drink, but I just cant bring myself to pay their extortianate prices. I had a sandwich and a banana in my bag and ate those. Then I found myself looking for bargains in Tesco's. I thought I might get myself a little treat, something nice to eat. I bought a multipack 12 bags of crisps for 48p and a bottle of peach flavour water for 34p, and sat on the chairs behind the checkouts watching the world go by while I ate six of the bags of crisps and swigged from the bottle. Very ladylike I think not.I thought, this is daft, I have some money in my purse, I could buy myself something, but what do I need. I wandered in and out of the shops in a daze. Every time I scanned across the shelves I thought that's nice, but I don't need it. I looked in Bodyshop I used to like their stuff. Oh look, Body Butter half price, only \u00a36.50, still too much for me. I thought I might get myself some outdoor gear for my walking so I went into Blacks, the outdoor clothing specialist shop. I checked out the jackets and trousers and nearly fainted with shock, how much! Then suddenly I remembered, my jog bottoms are looking a bit scruffy, going baggy round the knees, stains on them, and a few holes. I'll get some new jog bottoms.I went in and out of all the shops again, looking for the best prices. Eventually I found some, I actually spent six pounds on two pairs from Primark. Wow, that wasn't too difficult was it, maybe I could buy a body warmer as well, my old one has the pocket almost ripped off. I had a quick look for one but by that time I was really cold and couldn't be bothered any more. Maybe spending six pounds was enough for one day."}, {"title": "You never know what you might see.", "date": "Thursday 28 January 2010", "text": "Lazy me didn't get up till 8.45 today. At last we have some sun, so as this walking bug seems to have taken hold I set off for a local walk, a bit more excercise for the legs can't do any harm. Even walking on familiar footpaths is enjoyable, you never know what you might see. I called at the shop on the way out and bought a bar of chocolate, to give me an energy boost of course. I walked along the bottom of the wood to Flixborough, turned left along the edge of a field. I was pleased to see that the kissing gates at both ends had been replaced with brand spanking new ones. The last time I was here the stiles were crumbling. I walked along the road and turned down Bagmoor Lane, I stopped to watch the wind turbines, one of them wasn't working. The door at the bottom was open and two men came out, they must be repairing it, I thought. One of the men went to the car, while the other one had a pee up the side of the turbine. I don't think that will make it go any better, ha ha. A bit further on I saw two deer in the woods. I must have startled them because they scurried away.Then I carried on past the chicken farm, we have a lot of them round here, horrible places. Saw some gulls on a big pond next to the council tip, they all took to the air, I wondered if Jonathan was there. The breeze rippled the water.I turned left up a track which was more like a stream, to Thealby, then along the road, turn right along the edge of a field, past the new cemetary, the playing field, and the allotments, and home. It was turning chilly by now, the sun had gone in, three hours was enough, I was ready for a late lunch."}, {"title": "What is a Scrapstore", "date": "Wednesday 27 January 2010", "text": "I have been at the Scrapstore today so I thought I would post some pictures in case some people don't know what a Scrapstore is. We collect stuff from businesses which would normally be thrown into a hole in the ground. We then distribute it to anyone who wants it for crafting purposes. Individuals can come and buy it very cheaply, and teachers collect it for use in their classes.Today we had a delivery from Hull Scrapstore, they very kindly give us stuff that they have to spare. This is Tracy, she does all the collecting and delivering for Hull.Lorraine helping to unload, she is our main volunteer, she comes in most days.This is Bob, Loraines husband, he is helping Tracy. The main part of the store, we also have a big workshop, office, storeroom, kitchen and toilets. A display of some of the things that have been made using scrap.Rolls of fabric donated by a company that makes window blinds. Vinyl donated by a company that makes lorry curtain sides. Plastic trays, tubs, and bottles, collected from food manufacturers Rolls of sticky tape.Cardboard spools with plastic ends, we can find a use for anything.Assortment of wood, mostly medium to smaller pieces because we don't have the room to store anything larger.Rolls of stickers and decorated plastic tapes, some sticky some are not.Drums of fabric, leather, and foam offcuts.We also have all kinds of fabrics from the biggest rolls to the smallest of pieces, we have paint, dress patterns, cardboard, zips, wool, absoulutely anything that can be used for something other than what it was intended for.

My thigh and upper leg muscles have become rather flabby, too much sitting in front of this computer I think. I am never going to climb a mountain in this state so I had better do something about it, get off my butt for a start.I have joined a walking forum, which will hopefully spur me on to get out into the great outdoors. The members seem a great bunch of people, they post pictures and write reports of their walks, I can ask questions on any walk related topic and a lot of people come forward with the answers. They also organise meet ups to go walking in different parts of the country, that should be good fun. Although I enjoy walking by myself it would be nice to meet some friendly folk who have similar interests. I had to come up with a new name for myself to use on the forum, so now I am, 'fit old bird'. So you can see how important it is for me to get some training under my belt, I have a name to live up to. If I join them for a 20 mile hike it would be so embarrassing if I collapsed in a heap before we got to the finish, I would never live it down. I would have to change my name to 'knackered old bird' :-(Anyway, I have hit on the ideal solution to get fit, join a gym. Ok I know gym membership costs an arm and a leg, but I have found a very special gym. It costs nothing to join and nothing for a session, it's totally free. It is open 24/7 weekdays and weekends, so I can go anytime, and no limit on how long I stay there. Sounds too good to be true doesn't it? I also don't need to buy any special gear because my normal clothes will do. There is a downside to it, there are no showers and no coffee shop, but that doesn't matter because it is two minutes from where I live. I can literally walk out of my door, do my training and be back in the house again to drink my own coffee. I'm starting off with two short sessions daily, I want to build up the muscles in my legs gradually without injuring myself. No point in going at it like a mad woman, then having to rest up because I have torn a ligament. I like to go last thing at night before bed time, it's nice and quiet and I have the place to myself. Eventually I shall extend the sessions to last longer as my fitness increases. At the moment I am huffing and puffing a bit, but that should get easier with time. I took some photo's of my gym when I was there this morning, I bet some of you might have a gym like this. This is the entrance, it's called Stather Hill. Turn right at the pub, past the church and follow the footpath on the right hand side. When you go round the bend you can see the length of the hill into the distance. Walk very briskly down to the bottom.When you reach the cottages you are at the bottom where it starts to level out. No point in going any further because the real training starts now as you turn round and head back up. Keep up the same pace on the uphill stretchAlmost back up at the top. This is where I start puffing a bit, but it's head down and march on. There is a bench on the left to sit on if you come over all faint, but so far this has not happened to me. The street lights are a bit sparse at this point, just be carefull that I don't slip off the edge of the pavement, a twisted ankle would put me out of action for a waile.It's a great gym, isn't it? Six months of this and I will be running up those mountains.

Looking back through my life there are many instances when I have felt empowered to follow my own instincts, and make my own decisions on which path to follow. One thought that keeps coming into my head again and again is that I don't feel the need to do what everybody else is doing. I don't have to go with the flow, and it's ok to be different.Here is a quote from the book to illustrate :-'For the next few days, Jonathan tried to behave like the other gulls, he really tried, screeching and fighting with the flock around the piers and fishing boats, diving on scraps of fish and bread. But he couldn't make it work, it's all so pointless he thought.'Jonathan went off to do his own thing, he practiced his flying untill he became an expert. But this brought him big problems with the elders of the flock, they didn't understand. He tried to tell them why he wanted to fly high but they didn't want to listen, and so he was cast out.Here is another quote :-'Jonathan spent the rest of his days alone, but he flew way out beyond the cliffs. His one sorrow was that the other gulls refused to believe the glory of flight that awaited them, they refused to open their eyes and see. Jonathan discovered that boredom and fear and anger are the reasons that a gulls life is so short, and with these gone from his thoughts, he lived a long fine life indeed.' I can understand Jonathans thinking, you must live your life for yourself, even though it means others may shut you out. You are the only person you have to live with, if you are at peace with yourself then you have a good life. Try reading Jonathan Livingston Seagull, if you haven't already, there may be some answers in there for you.Thank you Frugal Queen for adding your comment yesterday, I understand what you are saying."}, {"title": "Flying with Jonathan", "date": "Sunday 24 January 2010", "text": "There was a lot of seagulls swooping and circling the back garden today, no doubt tempted by the meat and two veg scattered on next doors lawn. My neighbours are avid bird feeders, the leftovers from most of their meals play a big part in feeding the bird population round here. I don't know where these seagulls came from as we are not close to the sea. I can only think they must have been hovering somewhere near the Humber Bridge when their radar system picked up the distinct aroma of roast potatoes.Every time I see seagulls I always look for one that is flying higher than the rest of them, because this one is special, he is called Jonathan Livingston Seagull. Someone gave me a book about him over thirty years ago, it was written by Richard Bach and was first published in 1970. It is the story of Jonathan who is bored with doing seagully things like following the boats and picking fish out of the sea. He is frustrated with the meaningless materialism and conformity and limitation of the seagull life. He has ambitions, wants to do better things, like flying higher than any other seagull. He practices every day and stops following the boats, he is missing his meals because he is so driven by his quest for excellence. He becomes skinny through lack of food and his elders are worried for his health, but Jonathan doesn't give in untill he fulfills his goal. His flock turn their backs on him, casting him out of their society. He finds another flock who are all high flyers, and they take him to a higher plane. Eventually Jonathan becomes a master of his craft and passes on his knowledge to younger gulls. We are all free to soar in our own directions in life. This is a quote from the book. 'Dont believe what your eyes are telling you. All they show is limitation. Look with your understanding, find out what you already know, and you'll see the way to fly.'I read this book many times when I was in my twenties, and each time I found something I hadn't seen before. It reminds me that I can be whatever I want to be. I lent my copy of the book to someone and never got it back. Seeing the seagulls today has reminded me to get another one."}, {"title": "It's a dogs life", "date": "Saturday 23 January 2010", "text": "I've got my sleepover guest here again. Henry arrived just after 1pm, Helen his chauffeur dropped him off with his overnight bag.

I am glad that Helen remembered to pack his favourite blue rubber ball, we spend ages playing with that. He is very good at catching it, and sits at the top of the stairs while I throw it from the bottom. Then he pushes it with his nose so it hops all the way back down to me, and the game starts again. After the goodbyes were said Henry looked at me. I know what he is thinking, when are we going to go out. He knows the signal, I take my jacket from the coat hook near the door, and his tail starts wagging frantically. He waits patiently as I check that I have everything I need, poopascoop, plastic poo bags, biscuits, keys, phone, camera, tissues for my wet nose. We had a long walk, two hours, and he was in and out of the muddy dykes as usual. It is not easy to get a good photo of him because he wont stand still, but I managed to get this one.We have just had our dinner, and are off out again for a walk round the block.

Well I was keeping him a secret, in case anyone else made a play for him, I am the jealous type you know. He has been my fella for a couple of years now, we don't actually 'walk out' together, he is a little shy you see.We met in the High Street, I remember it well. I was busy rummaging in my bag for my purse, which inevitably is always at the bottom. I always panic when I cant find it straight away, oh my God, I'll have to cancel the cards. Saved once again, my fingers found the small purse, I really must get a bigger one then I wouldn't have these panic moments. I walked towards the automatic doors of the shopping centre, and the most handsomest hunk caught my eye. My heart missed a beat and I blushed, was he looking at me? He was lurking in Burtons Menswear window, a shop I never usually give a second glance to. I looked away and took a few steps, I turned and looked back over my shoulder, he was still looking. I hurried on towards Woolworths and thought no more about it.The following week I was in the town again, and wondered if the hunk would be there. I turned the corner, this time my eyes were searching the shop window. Yes, my heart was by now missing several beats when I saw that he was looking right at me. I walked on a few steps and as I walked I noticed that his eyes were following me. I hadn't the nerve to enter the shop, and went on my way.This happened for three or four weeks, he was watching me every time I passed. Then I could stand it no longer, I had to go in the shop. There were several sales assistants tidying the clothes rails, I approached the cash desk and felt a little bit silly. A nice young lady asked if she could help. It's now or never I thought, here goes. 'You know that huge poster you have in the window of a rather dishy man wearing a green sweatshirt, I would like to take him home with me. Can I have him when you have finished with him?' She smiled and said, 'yes, he is rather nice isn't he. You can have him in a couple of weeks when we change the window display, I will save him for you'. So here is my fella, he is in my hallway and smiles at me every time I walk by. Isn't he gorgeous?

Part of me wanted to take off into the hills somewhere for a hike, I'm getting withdrawal symptoms because I haven't been anywhere interesting lately, but I also wanted to buy a couple of Ordnance Survey maps. Now I can't justify getting into my car to go to town, just to go into one shop. I suppose I could have gone free on the bus, but that seemed a waste of time, just for two maps. By the time I had finished dithering there wasn't a bus at the right time anyway.Then I thought about it, it's too late to go walking now, but if I drove to town I could call in a couple of factories and pick up some stuff for the Scrapstore. I could take that huge money plant with me that I have been promising to give to one of the volunteers. I could take the red velvet beads with me to show Lorraine. I could pay my visa card bill at the bank. I could get some dog biscuits from the market, \u00a31 for a big bag. I could look for some black paint to finish the coffee table. I could go to the college and book myself on a couple of courses that start in March. I could pick up some cat litter from Morrisons, and I could get the maps. Sorted.Everything went almost according to plan, except I couldn't find any paint cheap enough, so the search continues for that one. The price of cat litter has shot up, I wonder if it is because everyone was buying it to scatter on their icy paths, so I only got two bags instead of the six I normally get. I will have to look elsewher for a better price. And I didn't have time to go to college, so I will ring and book the places.It was lucky I was in the car, because I spotted a big metal display basket at the back door of Wicks, on the grass verge where they put stuff they don't want and people can help themselves. It was a bit bent, but I thought, no matter, Bob can straighten it at the Scrapstore, it will come in handy. There was also a very nice clean pallet and a large piece of wooden chipboard, so they found their way into the back of my car as well. By the time I got to the Scrapstore, I had quite a haul for them, fabrics and vinyls and cardboard tubes, they were well pleased.

How could she do that to him, such a nice hardworking lad, and after that lovely Christmas present he bought her as well. I do hope he finds someone else, someone a bit more appreciative.Isn't life a bitch sometimes? I've had my fair share of broken hearts, been stood up on dates, and been dumped a few times. They just walk away, I mooch around and cry into my pillow. It sort of knocks you back a bit, your self esteem takes a battering and you lock yourself into your room wondering if life will ever be the same without a good looking boyfriend to show off to your mates. What a bummer it is when you get dumped.But I have also been the one doing the dumping. You think you have found the right one, it's all sweetness and light, he picks you up to take you out, parties, dancing, holding hands, and walking along the beach under the moon light.

Hopefully you have learnt something along the way. Your heart gets broken, it mends, you move on.I don't know what's going to happen to poor Tyrone, he is still a young lad, perhaps his heart will be broken again sometime.

His name is Mr Beasley, he was kept inside for a week when his owner moved house, but he went walkabout and ended back at his previous home. Sue has looked after him since before Christmas, but now he is back in his new house, and hopefully he will stay there this time.It was great to get out for a walk today, I put a sandwich and a drink in my backpack and off I went. I stayed local and was out for nearly five hours across fields and farm tracks. I like the solitude of walking alone, it gives me time to think, to mull over things that have happened, to look for reasons and solutions. Sometimes people can be so unfair, they make judgments without knowing the full facts, and they say hurtfull things. I mentioned a few days ago that I needed to declutter my mind, well I have done it now. I know the truth and that's all that counts. I have deleted these people, they no longer have a place in my life. Sorry if this sounds a bit cryptic, but in a nutshell, if someone treats you unfairly it's best to walk away. So now I feel a lot better. I saw a waterfall today. This is my first attempt at making a necklace using the glass beads I bought for \u00a31 from a charity shop. I have seen this idea at a craft fair, they had beads tied within a fabric tube, and a knot between each bead. I made a tube from some red velvet I had left over from a previous project. I guessed that 30inches would be about the right length, best to make it longer than you think, you can always shorten it later.The strip of fabric needs to be slightly wider than the bead to allow for the seam. Sew it together right sides in, very close to the edge so it doesn't look bulky. Then the tricky bit, turn the sausage inside out. I attached a piece of thin string to one end with a needle, then threaded the tube onto a crochet hook from the other end, hooked onto the string, and pulled it through. You have to be careful that you don't pull too hard and break some of the machine stitches. Ease it gently inch by inch. Next I inserted a bead and pushed it to the middle. I found that I couldn't knot the fabric as it was too bulky, so I decided to use some fine wire that I had taken out of a video player. I think you might find some of this if you take any old electronic gadget apart.I cut 6 inch long pieces and wrapped them very tightly in between the beads. A pair of small pliers helps to pull the wire tight and twist the ends together. Keep adding to the first bead either side of it until you have the desired length. I couldn't find a fastener so I have left two ends of four inches to tie the necklace at the back, sew up the ends. My necklace has 30 beads, and the gold coloured wire in between gives it a look of classy handmade. It wouldn't look out of place on a table at a craft fair with a \u00a310 tag on it. Total cost, less than 1p. I'll make another one with some different fabric."}, {"title": "Making a coffee table", "date": "Saturday 16 January 2010", "text": "This is a post for Butterfly, or anybody else, about what you can do with cat food boxes. I made this coffee table some time ago and have been thinking of ways to finish it off.I have used fourteen boxes, a simple test design to see if it will work. The two sides are four boxes on each side, the top is six boxes. Make the sides first. You need to get inside, pierce small holes on the outside about one inch from the edge where two boxes meet. You also need to pierce another hole through the two boxes on the inside so you can thread a piece of string right the way through, and tie the ends in a tight knot on the outside. Trim off excess string and close the box lids. Practice with two boxes first. When you have made the sides, make the top in the same way with six boxes. Then tie the three sections together. It's like a bridge but the middle two boxes will not fall in if you tie the string tightly. You can see on the first picture that I covered the joins with parcel tape to strengthen it. I had to remove this later because the papier mache would not stick to it. I then covered the whole thing, except the bottom, with papier mache. I started with walpaper paste and newspaper, but it wasn't sticking very well. Also the wet was distorting the flat sides of the boxes, they were bowing inwards. I tried tearing up some large sheets of white paper and stuck these on, it worked a lot better than the newspaper. Any recycled A4 sheets would do, it's a better quality paper than newsprint. Then I had to build up the dips with extra paper to try and level the surface. I used some old CV's next because they were printed on strong paper. Now the whole thing is covered in washable wallpaper. I put a coat of varnish on the top which has stuck alright, but it is difficult to get the edges straight and tidy. It is very sturdy.I think there is no limit as to what furniture you could make with them if you have the space to work. Think of them like lego bricks, in fact you could use lego to play around with different designs, then copy it with the boxes. If you make anything big though you would have to think about it being very inflammable, it would be very dangerous if it was placed in a position where it might catch fire."}, {"title": "Better than landfill - make a bag", "date": "Friday 15 January 2010", "text": "What can you do with sixteen dry cat food bags, seems such a shame to throw them away. I have been saving them because I like the bold colours. Light bulb moment.....MAKE A BAGFirst I did the back and front. Sew four bags together with a flat overlap seam, zigzag stitch on the machine. Zigzag two bags together for the side, make two. Then join the four pieces together with running stitch seams on the outside, so you have a bag with no bottom. Next join two bags with zigzag seam for the bottom, trim to size and pin into place. Sew together. Fold top edge over one and a bit inches and pin. Make two handles out of two bags, you have to open bags out lengthways and cut two strips, fold lengthways, sides to middle, and stitch. Do two rows of running stitch around the top edge half an inch apart and attach handles while you are doing this.Overall dimensions are 14.5 inches tall, 15 inches wide, 7 inches deep, it will fold flatish when empty. It seems quite strong because it is double thickness, although I would use it for lighter items such as toilet rolls and cereal boxes, rather than heavy vegetables. That way it would last a lot longer.

There is three new exhibitions in our 20 21 Arts Centre, so I went along to have an eyeball. The first one is along the wall on the left hand side as you enter the reception area, about seven or eight very large abstract waterpaintings in pastel wishy washy colours. It is supposed to be pictures of Venice. I read the introduction by the artist, loads of gobboldeygook masquerading as art speak, I didn't understand a word of it. Then I looked at the leaflet giving titles and prices. You could have knocked me down with a feather. How much, good grief, over \u00a31,000 for each one. How to describe the pictures? Straight lines, boxes, curves, squares and circles, randomly daubed on. I looked closely at the paper he had used, second hand out of the recycled box, with printing on the other side. What a swiz. If anyone buys one of those they must be out of their tree.Around the corner down the next corridor was an exhibition of Pointillism, painting by dots. The artist Sean Williams called it Between here and here. It was fantastic, such detail in his work. Anyway, I didn't get any photo's of that, I forgot all about it when I saw the next exhibition in the main church building. You know how you see something amazing and it stops you in your tracks, it was like wow, that is stunning. The artist is Marian Van Der Zwann from the Netherlands. The exhibition is called The Last Supper. I am stood in front of a very large table covered in a blood red velvet cloth, on it are several large loaves of bread and a gigantic pewter drinking goblet. Around the table are hanging pictures of female figures from different cultures and religions. Beautiful serene music played in the background, it was very calming. What a talented artist.

My old mates at HM Revenue & Customs have sent me a very cute little note telling me what they are going to do to me if I don't get my arse into gear and fill out my tax return. It seems the threat of a one hundred pound fine is hanging over my head.It's a coincidence because I was only talking to my accountant on the phone yesterday, asking if I will have to fill a form out now I am a pensioner. Barrie has been looking after my financial matters for the last few years. I know it sounds a bit daft, having an accountant when I have so little spending money in my pocket, but he has been a good investment, well worth the hundred quid or so I have paid him. He has ensured that I have claimed for all my allowances whilst I had my business, saving me loads of money.You may not believe this but I really struggle with numbers. I can work out simple calculations like how much money comes into my bank account and how much is going out, but that's about it. I was always bottom of the class in maths at school. Faced with anything more complex than add, subtract, multiply and divide, and I am completely flumoxed. When I signed up for my mortgage it was more like sticking a pin in a list of options. Dont even mention about traipsing round the building societies looking for the best deal, confused or what!Anyway, I am going to tackle this tax return myself, because there will be so little to put on it, surely I can't make a botch job of it, can I? The first thing is to register online, dunnit. Next wait for a pin number to come through the post. In the meantime I'd better gather a few bits of paper together, because time is running out.Why can't we just go into a real office and sit at a real desk, and get a real person to help us do this? I usually steer clear of putting any of my financial information onto the internet, I just don't trust it, things get hacked. Anyway, it's got to be done.

I was browsing the bric a brac table in our Scope Shop this afternoon and came across this...A carrier bag full of glass stones. There's small round ones like marbles, bigger flat ones, clear glass and opaque, a lot of blue ones, and some are metalic. They are usually displayed in a dish as a table decoration. I would say there is at least one thousand if not more, I don't fancy counting them there are that many, they weigh a ton. And they only cost \u00a31 for the whole bag.Now all I have to do is think of a good idea for them. I have seen somewhere where you make a long narrow sausage out of some thin fabric, stuff beads inside one at a time, and tie a knot between each one, and you end up with a necklace.

It is more or less how I imagined it would be, although all the way through it I kept changing my mind. Finding the exact parts to fit in the right colours was a challenge, I wanted to use wool, plastic, and vinyl and anything else a little bit unusual. I am pleased with the way it has turned out.First the six stones covered in crochet jackets.Springs from a video player painted with nail varnish.Six x 4inch coloured zips cut in half, stitched into circles and made into flowers.Tops from plastic felt tip pens sliced up and sewn on with beads.White buttons with spots painted on with nail varnish, and wool fluffed up.Piece of plastic washing line, the strands separated and knotted, and black beads added. Seven x 4inch coloured zips cut in half and wrapped tightly into spirals and stitched together.The rock pool is a piece of circular crochet in shades of blue to represent rippling water. I added a plastic backing to the underside, and inside is a tin lid completeley enclosed with crochet all completed in one piece, no seams. It is 9.5 inches in diameter.The blades of grass, and flowers, were cut from vinyl and stitched on. The fish is cut from a drinks can. The fluffy tufts of wool are sea creatures growing on the bottom of the pool, and the green tufty wool on the edge is grass.The five flowers are made from Christmas tree lights, with pink foam cut from the toe separaters in the centre, and blue beads added. The leaves are green vinyl, two pieces sewn together to sandwich the stalk which is wire from the lights.And here it is with the stones in place.It is a very nice decoration for a sideboard, or a centre piece for the table. You could make a collection of stones for it, and change it round every so often so it always looks different. I must say the finished article looks far better than the photo's.

He had filled the hole up to capacity and then had to trundle across the foot deep snow with his wheelbarrow, to dispose of the excess onto the pile in the corner. After several trips backwards and forwards, I watched him lean on his spade for a few minutes while he took a swig from his bottle of water. I felt quite sorry for him.Apparently more elderly people die in the winter than the summer. I realise in these hard times that someone might be gratefull for a job as a grave digger, but I can't help wondering that it might be a lot easier if the corpse was sent on it's final journey to a crematorium during ice cold weather. We could perhaps keep the burials for the summer months when the sun shines and the flowers dance in the breeze. A more pleasant task for the grave digger. A few years ago when times were very lean, I was doing several part time jobs to make ends meet, one of them being the church cleaner. I gave myself the title, Church Scrubber, which brought a little chuckle whenever I mentioned it. I had a key to let myself in and could choose my own hours to fit in with everything else. I was in there one day at about 4pm, when the vicar came in. He looked a little perplexed and asked how long was I going to be. I said I had mopped the stone floors, done the dusting, cleaned the toilet, and needed to get the hoover out for the carpets.He said the funeral directors were due to arrive with Mr Webster, in a box, and his wife was coming along to pay her respects and meet her husband on his final journey. The plan was to leave him there untill the funeral the next day. I said, 'That's ok, I will go home and have my tea and come back to finish off.'Two hours later I crept into the church and put all the lights on, glancing at the coffin on it's wooden stand at the front. I plugged the hoover in and started. I did all round the edges first but my eyes were drawn towards the coffin as I got closer and closer. I kept thinking about what would happen if this was a horror film, imagining the lid to slide off, and Mr Webster slowly rising to sit bolt upright. I looked to see if the lid was fastened down, it was, and I was relieved. As my initial apprehension subsided and I became more comfortable with the situation I found myself talking to him and hoovering right underneath him. I hope he appreciated the effort I was putting in to make the church look nice for him. I often say hello as I stroll past his grave."}, {"title": "Memories of fun in the snow", "date": "Thursday 7 January 2010", "text": "I finally got to Tesco this afternoon, it was touch and go after several snow storms this morning. I had a brainwave to defrost the car. It is parked close to the front door so I plugged an extension lead into the kitchen, and put a small portable fan heater inside the car. The windows defrosted in ten minutes and it was warm and snug inside when I set off. My street is always the last one to clear of snow, but as I got onto the main road it wasn't too bad. My shopping came to just under \u00a334 in total, including the bargains I picked up at the cash and carry as I was passing. If we get more snow I will be ok for a couple of weeks, maybe three.I am pleased that I haven't got to take a lorry out in this weather, I can remember some horrendous shenanigans in the snow in years gone by. The biggest problem we had was with the diesel solidifying in the pipework from the tank to the engine. You held your breath everytime you turned the key to fire it up. It coughed and spluttered, then gave up with a big groan. Some of the drivers used to light little bonfires underneath their engine, I was never brave enough to do that, preferring to ring for assistance. It was bliss when they finally added something to the fuel to stop this happening, but we had to scout around to find the fuel stations which had this magic formula in their tanks. I used to have lots of nights out in my cab, in fact I had one job when I lived in the lorry, only getting home on a Friday night or Saturday morning. There was a particularly cold night when I was on Cardiff lorry park, and I hadn't got a night heater in the cab as they had only recently been invented. Some of my fellow campers thought I was mad to stay in my cab and advised me to get booked into a B & B instead. I said I would be ok. Walking back from the pub with my pals, I was indeed beginning to feel a bit parky and wondered if I should have taken their advice. One of the drivers suggested I bring my matress and bedding into his cab and sleep across the seats, because he had a night heater. He assured me that I would be perfectly safe, he was sleeping in the pod in the roof, a bit like a loft. At first I declined his offer, then as we got back to the park I changed my mind. I thought sod it, I don't want them to find me frozen to death in my cab. I was lovely and snug, the night heater kept coming on to top up the hot air, by the time morning came I was sweltering. I don't know what the other drivers thought when they saw me carrying my bedding back across the park to my own cab, but I didn't care, he was the perfect gentleman. I remember one winter, it had been snowing all day on the last day of the school term before the kids broke up for Christmas. I was driving buses for Stevensons Travel and did the school runs, which were mainly in the countryside. Most of the kids were picked up and dropped off outside their houses, some of them quite remote. They never thought of closing the schools early in those days, so at normal finishing time I was there to pick them up.  It was starting to get dark when we turned off the main road down a narrow country lane, the snow was coming down. Up ahead I could see a pair of headlights coming towards us so I eased off the accelerator and slowed down to a crawl. The dozen or so kids I had left on were all near the front of the single decker, I think they were trying to help me to see where we were going. As the headlights got closer it became apparent that the vehicle was as big as my bus, a rigid six wheeler lorry which had stopped. I started to brake but we kept on sliding down the hill towards it. Now we were in trouble. There was no way I was going to hit that lorry, and the road was not wide enough for us to pass each other, there was only one thing left to do. I shouted to the kids to hold on, and steered into the grassy bank on the left hand side. The back end on the right hand side slid into the other bank and the bus was wedged across the road. The kids thought it was hilarious. We all gathered our belongings and clambered out of the emergency door at the back, and headed off towards the lights of a farmhouse. The kind people allowed the kids to ring their parents to come and collect them. I rang my boss for a breakdown truck, he said, 'Oh no, not another one'. Seems I wasn't the only driver that night to get into a bit of bother.

Yep, it's just fine, good old trusty Ford.I rang my friend in the next village to see how she was going on in the snow. I said I might go shopping tonight because that would be the quietest time on the road. She rang me back at just after six and said, 'Thank goodness I have caught you, don't go'. Her husband has just arrived home from work after struggling up the orbital hill, it's like a sheet of ice. The only trouble is that to get anywhere from here we have to go up or down a hill. I will go tomorrow instead, I hope it is sunny so the ice will be melted on the roads.I took Ben out this afternoon for his comfort walk and it snowed heavily while we were out. Alright for him with his big fur coat. When we got back to his house I left him in the kitchen on his mat by the back door. Although his coat keeps him warm he gets lumps of snow and ice sticking to his legs and undercarriage. My friend would not be best pleased if she found puddles all over her living room carpet.   There was a message on my answer machine when I got back, the doctors surgery has cancelled my visit for tomorrow morning. I was supposed to be helping out with some training with student doctors, they want to quiz me about my ovarian cyst I had in 2008. I don't mind doing this, they have to learn somehow. Anyway, the students can't get there because of the weather, and I think I might find it difficult as well, there's a big hill to go up. They are going to ring me back with another appointment.My dinner was a bit basic tonight, using up some bits and bobs. I fried an onion in olive oil, added half a tin of sweetcorn, it was 20p for the whole tin, and half a jar of cheese sauce that was six months out of date and cost 30p. I cooked it for ten minutes, and boiled some egg noodles from a packet that cost 60p from which I have had four portions. A cheap dinner, well below my \u00a31 per meal limit.

The silver birch trees at the bottom of the garden are very pretty, like they have had a dusting of icing sugar, all white and crispy.I am getting a bit low on food, I could do with going to the supermarket, but it says on the radio not to drive unless it is absolutely necessary. Well looking at my food stocks I suppose I could always have soup or prawns for breakfast, or perhaps runner beans, carrots, and peas would make a change :-) Ha ha, not quite that bad. I have some bran flakes and porridge oats left, but if it carries on like this and I can't get out I will be having some weird and wonderful combinations on my plate. This has got me thinking about how society would manage if extreme weather conditions became the norm, certainly we would all have to drastically alter our shopping and eating routines. How many would cope if we got snowed in for weeks at a time? Some would panic and stockpile all those familiar items they couldn't live without, ready meals, snack foods, and booze. Looking at my food stash I could probably live off what I have in for 3 - 4 weeks. My imagination would take over and I would stretch out the ingredients to concoct some strange but wholesome meals. I am not a fussy eater, plain and simple that's me, so I wouldn't be bothered if I had to make a few variations of the same dish. Imagine the worst case scenario, if no one could get in and out of the village. We have a small mini market/general grocery store, there would soon be queues outside there and the shelves would be stripped. The two pubs would sell out of food, then that's it. Next would be the allotments getting raided. I have some sprouts in my garden so I could eat them, and there is a smallholding down the road where I could get free range eggs, that's if they will have any left. They might have a few winter veg in their poly tunnels as well. I suppose we could all go down to the fishing ponds and the river and try and hook something for tea. And if we were really desperate we could raid the kennels and cattery for any tins of chum or Felix, I believe it is tasted by humans so it can't be that bad. I have got the usual rice, pasta, and a few tins in the cupboard, and a freezer full of mostly veg, so I will be ok for a while. If this snowing keeps up I am sure my self sufficiency skills will see me through. On second thoughts, maybe I will ring the bus company in the morning to see if the buses are running.

I am quite excited because I have some Christmas tree lights that don't work, so I took them to pieces and can use some of the parts in this. A few weeks back I found one of those pink foam toe separators in the street, you put it between your toes when you paint your nails so the polish doesn't smudge. Why it should be lying in the street I don't know, but I picked it up thinking it might come in usefull, and it has. Here is another rock, it has three flowers on it made from six coloured zips, and buttons. The zips are 5 inches long, the two sides are separated and the zipper bit removed. Then sew two ends of one half zip together to make a circle and make a row of running stitch along the opposite edge to the teeth. Pull the stitches tight to make a flower shape. Do six of these and add three buttons to make three flowers.And here is the pool, well the start of a pool, it needs to be bigger, and a lot more added to it. Think of the blue circles as ripples of water. I know it doesn't look like a pool at the moment, but it will. It needs to have some plants growing on it, and around the edges.

Since May last year when I changed from Job Seekers Allowance to State Pension, the balance has been steadily increasing. I haven't made a conscious effort to save, so this happy state of affairs could be down to the fact that my frugal life style is so normal and routine that I hardly notice the pennies mounting up. And of course we all know that a few pennies saved every day add up to a few pounds eventually.Take shopping for instance, it's normal for me to go to town, buy what I went for, and come home. Sometimes I wander into one or two other shops, just out of curiosity more than anything, but I always come out with nothing because I feel sick at the sight of all that stuff bulging from the shelves that is neither use nor ornament to anyone with a sense of value.It's also normal for me to sit in my house, with no heating on, wearing more clothes than I would outdoors. My utility bills are normally an average of \u00a375 a quarter combined gas and electricity. If you look down the list of money saving tips on the right hand side, I practice just about all of them. I think nothing of it, it's normal to me.So what am I going to do with this accumulation of cash? The interest rate is so low at the moment, if I save it I wouldn't be gaining very much. I suppose I could pay a lump sum to the Building Society to shrink my already small mortgage, but as I am paying very little interest it hardly seems worth the bother.I have never in my whole life had any long term savings, a secret stash somewhere put away for a rainy day. As long as I have a small emergency fund should any unforseen disaster strike my home, me, the car, or my cats, that's as far ahead as I plan for.So it seems the best thing I can do is spend my spare cash, after all I can't take it with me. So now I must find something I need, because if I spend it on something frivolous that would be wasteful. So how can I spend money and be frugal at the same time?

I seem to have slowed down, and the world is spinning faster, whoa put the brakes on.The first day of a new decade, and a time for reflection. What better place to get lost inside ones own head, than strolling through the woods and fields of our wonderful countryside. There was a dusting of snow overnight which glistened in the morning sun. I decided to start the new year as I mean to go on, and not waste any opportunity to get out walking. I set off, out of the door, round the back of the church, down the hill, through the gate, across the field to the fishing pond, and on to the river bank. The pond is frozen over, no one fishing and no ducks or swans, I wonder where they have all gone.Picking my way round hundreds of mole hills along the river bank, I could hear the church bells ringing out welcoming everyone to the midday service. Overhead a gaggle of geese were chattering away as they flapped their wings in formation, soon out of sight and on their way. This is the area where they want to put some wind turbines which is upsetting a lot of people in the village. Up to now I haven't been drawn into that arguement and I think it's best not to let my feelings be known. Once they are up and running I don't think they look too bad, don't tell anyone I said that. I reached Flixborough and skirted round the edge of the industrial estate to join the path that runs along the bottom of the wood, and back home. By this time the sun had disappeared, the sky darkened and a few flakes of snow were falling. I came across this chappie in the middle of a field, looks like he has plenty of time to contemplate a new year out in all weathers. Behind me is the wood, and a long way in the distance is the river bank.What was the outcome of all my reflecting? Overall 2009 hasn't been too bad for me, although the first five months when I was on the dole wasn't very pleasant. Being patronised and made to feel like a scrounger was soul destroying. It was only when I stopped looking for work that did not exist, and concentrate on just getting through each week living on very little income, I began to relax and enjoy myself. Freeing yourself from the shackles of earning money takes a weight off your shoulders. Having no money means you don't need to think about spending it, freeing up time to do other things. Once I became a pensioner it was plain sailing, so as long as the government keep on paying what they owe me, then I will have a wonderful life. I am not sure what 2010 will bring, it's still at the planning stage, but I am sure that I will make the most of it. I want to do more walking, longer distances if my health holds out. I want to keep busy busy busy, grabbing opportunities when they arise. Not waiting for things to happen but making them happen. I have just been watching 'An Englishman in America', the last part of the life of Quentin Crisp, I love his philosophy. John Hurt played the part perfectly. In his last stage appearance, in Tampa Florida, Quentin finished with this gem. 'If there is anything that you want, don't look on the outside. Look on the inside to see if there's anything you haven't unpacked'.

Before this happened I thought I might bury my cats in the garden when the time came, but the ground is hard, and I would be so upset I doubt I could find the strength and courage to go through with it. Also if I moved house I would still be leaving them behind. So I though cremation would be best.In the spring I will pick a nice day, when the sun shines and the new growth is coming through on the bushes, I will scatter his ashes in the places where he did his territorial spraying, so he will still be doing his duty and scaring the other cats away. I felt a bit better this morning, after a good nights sleep, so I went off for a walk as it was nice and sunny. My friend told me that someone had taken a vehicle onto the footpath along the top of the woods, between here and the picnic area, and at the point where the water naturally flows down from the fields and into the woods, the ground had been churned up that bad the path was now impassible. I went to have a look.They had come down from the posh housing estate and flattened the security post on the tarmac snicket, put there to stop youths driving onto the walking area. The size of the tyre tracks made me think it was some kind of dumper truck, definately a four wheel drive vehicle. I followed the tracks to the the water crossing, it was a mess. They had tried to turn round at that point and gouged great deep ruts into the ground, it's a wonder the vehicle didn't turn over. I was so annoyed that someone had made so much mess on our lovely footpath. A lot of people use this route, it's a very popular picturesque place to walk. I had a bit of time to spare so I set about looking for wood to cover it so that people could get by without too much difficulty. I know where the youths hang out in the woods and went in search of pallets. I found one and dragged it up to the path and along to the swamp. A good scout round the area revealed more wood which I gathered up and threw onto the mud. Nearby is a small stream with some good sized rocks in it, so about twenty of these also landed in the mud. After about an hour and a half, and covered in mud myself I finally gave up. Several people had come by while I was working and were able to get by. Perhaps someone else might come along and finish the job off. This is my building handiwork, as you can see I never got an engineering degree. Three hours to midnight. I would like to wish all my blogging friends aHappy New Year.I hope all your dreams come true and 2010 brings you lots ofjoy and happiness."}, {"title": "Goodbye Freddie", "date": "Tuesday 29 December 2009", "text": "I'm just going to do this post quickly because I am crying buckets. I took Freddie to the vet today because he had stopped eating and was very lethargic. He had his Christmas chicken dinner on Friday and Saturday, but then he didn't eat much more after that. The vet said he had a big lump in his stomach, he took a sample of fluid from him, the vet said it doesn't look good. He started to tell me about what could be done, xray, scan, then cutting him open.  It seemed such a lot to put a cat through, with no guarantee that the outcome would give him a good quality of life. He mentioned the words cancer and tumour and I realised what we had to do. I held Freddie while he went to sleep.My poor little Freddie, he turned up on my doorstep as a stray in a terrible mess, about seven years ago. A fiesty little fella, he ruled the roost and had us all trembling in our boots.  Goodbye my little friend, sleep tight."}, {"title": "Shhhhh, Horace is asleep", "date": "Monday 28 December 2009", "text": "The garden has looked lovely and clean these past few days, with a thick layer of snow covering up all the ugliness of the empty veg beds, and those where I have yet to pull up the last few dying plants. Today the sun is out and the ugliness is back.The lawn is covered in a white sliced loaf of bread torn to shreds and offered as bird food, along with fat balls, rotting apples, and a scattering of bird seed. The frying pan/bird bath is now visible and even though it is filled with fresh water, our feathered friends are not in a hurry to hop into it.As I followed Ben round the garden for his morning stroll I noticed that two of the raised beds have been used as a feline toilet, several little squiggly mounds are laid on the top. Despite my attempts at putting barriers over them, they have managed to squeeze under and between the branches I laid on top of the plastic trellis covering the surface. They must have given up trying to bury it, which I suppose is a good thing, because at least I can see it to scrape it off with a trowel, rather than sticking my hands into it in the spring when planting time comes around again. :-(My defences need to be reinforced, I gathered up the plastic tubs, pots, and pieces of wood that were scattered around and placed them on any bare sections of compost which might be the next target. I lifted a piece of wood which was laid over the join between two of the beds, there is a gap of a few inches here, and underneath I found a prickly ball. Horace the hedgehog was asleep.I quickly replaced the wood, not wanting to disturb him. I though hedgehogs buried themselves under piles of leaves and twigs, this one did not seem adequately covered. Not wanting the poor little mite to freeze to death, I got some plastic sheeting and made a tent over his hideaway. I do hope him and his friend survive and come back next spring. They came onto the lawn every night last summer because they knew there was a feast to be had, it was lovely to watch them.  The tall silver birch trees in the next garden are looking like skeletons. At the moment they are still, but when the wind comes a thousand small twiglets rain down on my garden. These are home to several wood pigeons who seem to do all their courting around here. All my pottering in the garden takes place down the bottom in the veg patch, the rest is lawns. The borders are full of evergreen bushes, so these only need trimming once in a while. I love the seasons in the garden, going to sleep in the autumn, resting in the winter, new growth shooting through in spring, and glorious colour in the summer. How lucky we are."}, {"title": "Quick peek into my rock pool", "date": "Saturday 26 December 2009", "text": "A month or so ago I posted a picture of a stone I had covered in crochet, and added some beads for decoration, just to remind you here it is again.Now I have some more stones finished which are going to be part of a larger table decoration. It's taking a bit of time to complete because I have a picture in my mind as to what I want the finished piece to look like. I have to be happy with each part of it, design wise, and the construction has to be as good as I can make it. I want to move a bit sideways with my creations, thinking further out of the box, using my imagination to make things more artistically appealing rather than having a practical use. I loved the tv programme, School of Saatchi, where six young people were given the task of creating pieces of art. Fascinating to see how different people's interpretation of art manifests itself. Anyway, I thought I would let you have a sneak preview of my new creation. I have finished six of the stones. To keep the cost as close to nil as I can, I am using found, recycled, or rubbish items that would be thrown away. Here is one stone.The springs are from a video recorder which I have taken apart. I have painted them with nail varnish, and stitched them onto the crochet covered stone. I rather like this one, the colours contrast nicely. The problem I had with the two long thin springs was the nail varnish chipped off when I bent them into an arc, so I had to repaint them once they were sewn on. Maybe I'll put a picture of another one on soon."}, {"title": "The big yawn", "date": "Friday 25 December 2009", "text": "I can't stop yawning, don't know why, I haven't done much today. Perhaps it's the two glasses of wine and the glass of sherry, or sittting in front of the computer watching two episodes of Coronation Street, one hour of Victoria Wood, The Fattest Man in Britain film, and the Queens speech. Or it could be the three dog walks that has worn me out, or the hour I spent chatting to my friend who is coming down with some nasty flu like symptoms. I did wash my hands and face and brush my teeth when I got back though, so I hope I haven't caught any of the germs that might have been flying around.Ben was well impressed with his steak, there is enough left for tomorrow, and the cats were equally thrilled with their grilled chicken breasts. I will open a tin of tuna for them tomorrow for their Boxing Day treat. I only have to say the word 'fish' and they immediately rush to the kitchen.No Skyping today, I don't know what happened to my brother who was supposed to call me, he hasn't been online at all.

Passing the time of day with the postman as he rushes to complete his deliveries, waving to my elderly neighbour who sits by the window, and chatting to the church gardener as he takes his dog for a walk.We had a big snowfall last night so I expected to wake up to snow halfway up the doors, but I am pleased to say it has started to melt. I like to keep my driveway snow free so I don't drag it into the house on my boots. My friends Alex and Irene are on their way to Edinburgh as I type, I hope they get there safely. It's not a journey I would like to undertake at this time of year, especially as the weather forecast is not good, predicting snow and ice. They have a large family and they all like to meet up for the Christmas celebrations.Thank you for your good wishes, I hope everyone has a lovely time.

I couldn't wait to strike out on my own when I reached 18, I was off. So I reckon I have kind of got used to being alone at Christmas, it's no big deal.I feel a touch of bar humbugs coming on. The build up starts earlier every year, and by the time December arrives I just wish it was all over. People ask me if I am ready for Christmas, and I want to scream, I have to stop myself from going off on a rant. I politely answer, 'I don't do it.'Why do people feel the need to go on a shopping frenzy, it's a trick, Christmas is for shops to make money, that's all. And what happens in January, everyone asks if you had a good Christmas, I smile sweetly and say yes.Anyway, I have the company of my pusscats, and Ben dog, perfect. Today I admit I did join the throngs at Tesco, to get a few treats for us. Steak for Ben, chicken for pussies, and smoked salmon for me.

Within minutes of switching the computer on this morning, I had a Skype call from my brother in India. It was amazing to be able to see him and chat with him. You can't chat as if you are in the same room though because there is a slight delay on the signal, so you have to wait for a gap at the end of a sentence. I find this quite difficult because I am usually in a hurry when I speak. I have an awful habit of cutting in before the other person has finished, a bit annoying for them I imagine. Anyway we managed. He showed me his dog, and I showed him Bugsy cat, and then I moved the webcam around the room, and showed him the snowy garden through the window. He laughed at me wrapped up in my many layers, he was sweltering in the heat with a shirt on open to the waist. Our chat lasted 59 minutes, we arranged to have a chat on Christmas day and have a party with a few drinks and food. That will be fun.  A bit later on I had another Skype link up with a friend who lives in the Orkney Isles, I haven't seen him for about five years, when he lived in Southport, so it was nice to catch up with him and his wife. They love it up there and had just been out with the ramblers club. I went to Sue's to take some photo's of Bigpuss, isn't he gorgeous.  Now we will ask around to find out where he lives, and if they want him back. Ben is now here with me, laid down besides my chair. Lilly is on my knee, Bugsy laid next to Ben, and Freddie on the bed, I'm surrounded by animals, it's great. You're never lonely with a pet."}, {"title": "Bigpuss is safe", "date": "Saturday 19 December 2009", "text": "Good news, Bigpuss is now safe in Sue's cat chalet, tucking into his dinner. I say 'his', she hasn't checked on it's gender yet. I think she has fallen in love with it, but there again she loves all cats. With 13 of her own her house is full of them, and each one is special. Tomorrow I will go and take some photo's of Bigpuss, so we can look for it's owner. At least he is safe now and has a warm bed, not wandering the streets in this bitterly cold weather.I've been fiddling around with Skype this morning, and hey, it works :-) Not too difficult to install. You are asked to take a snapshot of yourself for your profile, look at the webcam, smile, and click. I wondered if I really want anyone to see me in my slopping around the house gear, it's enough to make them roll about laughing, but what the heck, let's do it.The whole thing is rather clever, more toys to play with. I had to do a couple of tests to make sure I was working ok, test that my voice was beaming out and my speaker is working. I could hear my own voice coming back, weird. I sound just the same as when I was on the tele, a bit posh but rather intoxicated.I discovered I have four people already in my email address book who are on Skype. As soon as I imported the list across, I tried contacting Jonathan as a test. Lo and behold he was online and answered, magic. We had a lovely conversation, most of it was me laughing though. I haven't spoken to him for nearly thirty years although we ocassionally email each other. Isn't it just amazing that we can now chat.I have added another two people to my Skype list of contacts, so maybe later I will get to talk to them. I'm not sure what the time difference is between here and India, so when my brother gets out of bed, or gets logged on, we will have a chat. I will leave the computer on for the rest of the day, because it will tell me as soon as he is around.I'm chuffed that I can now chat to people all over the world for free, it will be a boon when I get shunted into an old folks home. As long as I can take my computer with me I will be happy to sit in my little room chatting to all my geriatric pals. :0)"}, {"title": "Brrrrrr it's cold outside", "date": "Friday 18 December 2009", "text": "We've had some heavy snowfalls over the last couple of days, looks pretty but not nice to drive in. I got my car back from the bodyshop yesterday, the paint job looks ok, but it will have to go back because I can't open the rear passenger door from the outside. Seems they took the door handle off and didn't but it back on correctly.I went to the Scrapstore this afternoon for a natter and a coffee. They are closing now untill the new year. My friend Sue rang me while I was out, she thinks someone has found Bigpuss, so I went and picked her up. We went to a womans house with a cat basket but there was no one in. According to the description the woman gave her on the phone it sounds like it could be the lost cat. Now we are waiting for a phone call to go and collect it, as Sue has an empty chalet, and we can keep it there while we get some posters up around the village. The plan is to get it back to it's owner, but we are wondering if the owner actually wants it. If I lost a cat I would have posters up all over the place and leafleting, within hours of it going missing. My brother who lives in India emailed me yesterday to ask if I have Skype, so we can talk to each other. Well I haven't, but I bought a webcam while I was in town, so now I have to download the programme from the site and get it set up. I'm not sure how it works but I'll give it a try. My sister is also going to get set up with it, I'll let you know how it goes. I was rather hoping to go out tomorrow, but with the roads being icy it would be madness to set off on a two hour journey if you don't really have to. I wanted to go to the Dickensian Christmas Market at Grassington in North Yorkshire, the photo's of last years event look fabulous. Such a disappointment, but it's not worth the risk. The journey could take a lot longer if there are hold ups because of accidents. It looks like I shall have a lodger next week, I have offered to have Ben while his owner goes down to London. She could have taken him with her but it would be a lot of hassle staying in a hotel with a small child as well. I am not doing anything in particular so he might as well share Christmas with me and the cats. I've got to get them all their pressies yet, some chicken and tasty treats might go down well. I thought I would put this spring picture in here to remind us of warmer times, and to cheer us up a bit.

This made me smile, my friend emailed it to me, cute kittys, all say Aaaarrrrhhhhhhh.Talking of cats, there is a lovely big ginger cat with a massive bushy tail around here, when it sees me it meeows like crazy and follows me. I was talking to my friend Sue about it who fosters cats, she has seen it as it hangs around the medical centre where she works. We are not sure where it lives or even if it has a home.I used to see it a few months ago, always in the garden of the house on the corner opposite the medical centre, but then it vanished. Now it is back. I think it has been in my house and stolen some food from my cats dishes. I was at the top of the stairs and caught a glimpse of a bushy tail disappearing out of the back door, I always leave it open so my boys can come and go as they please. At first I wondered if it was a fox, but I reckon it was big puss.It followed me last night and I picked it up, it seemed keen to stay with me. The fur underneath it and round it's back legs is a bit dirty and matted, but it wasn't skinny, as far as I could tell. I put it down and it followed me again. I was going to bring it home and ask around if it belongs to anybody. Not that I really want another cat though, but Sue would find a home for it if it is homeless. Anyway, big puss jumped up a six foot high fence and down the other side into a garden. I went back later to look for it but the paddock was awash with people carol singing around the tree, so I suppose puss was keeping out of the way.I spoke to Sue later on the phone and we couldn't decide if it belonged to anyone, so we thought we would ask around first before we catnap it. Sometimes people go out and leave their cats to walk the streets all day and night, which I think is terrible. I got my Lilly because his previous owners didn't care about him, he lives a life of luxury here with me now, compared to the dog kennel at the bottom of the garden he had before. That reminds me I must send them a Christmas card, from Lilly, or Smartie as they used to call him. They will probably be surprised he is still alive. I'm going out in a bit to walk Ben, my friends dog, so I'll take the camera and see if I can get a snap of big puss, and knock on a few doors in that area.

Glad it made you smile, the whole house made me laugh. :-)Sharon, I didn't find out what BDD was till later on, and when I read about it in a magazine, I thought, wow, that's me, now it is becoming clearer. Of course at the time I didn't tell anyone for fear of them calling me a crank. But it was like a light going on, oh so that's it! It's more than just hating something about yourself, it becomes the only thing you think about. Some people suffer much more than me, thankfully I have managed to cope reasonably ok. In fact it has probably made me the person I am. My confidence can sometimes plummet, then I over compensate and mentally drag myself back up from the doldrums, even becoming slightly bolshie. You have to or you wont survive. Annabel, I will look out for that book, I greatly admire women who challenge the norm, women who aren't afraid to be themselves. There are too many expectations put on women to conform to the stereotypical wife/mother role. It's good to know that women are choosing to follow their dreams. Jane, I like your blog piece, it's a shame they airbrushed Twiggy, she looks lovely anyway. When will people wake up and see the trashy celeb magazines for what they are, a money spinning, made up, plastic fantasy world. Sometimes those nasty media people snap a star without their slap, usually women, and say, 'oh my God, what does she look like?' Ermmm, excuse me....she looks normal.

I think a phone call to NHS Direct is imminent, however I will do this first.And now for something completely different, I feel confident at this stage to 'come out'. No I am not gay, but there has been something going on in my life which I very rarely talk about. I have tried to explain this to a few people but the response has always been the same, awkwardness and blank looks. If you haven't experienced it you can't understand it. I am hoping that at least one person reading this will know what I am talking about. I may waffle on for sometime, so if you become bored, feel free to skip this bit. I don't blame you because I can waffle.I'll give this, 'something going on', a name, Body Dysmorphic Disorder, or BDD. There, I've said it out loud and blown my cover. I'm not writing this to get to get it off my chest, I have tried to cast it off before and it doesn't work, it is always there, sometimes hidden and sometimes it rears it's ugly head. If you know someone who has this, my post will help you understand. It is classed as a mental disorder though mine has never been diagnosed. In my younger years I thought hating your looks was a part of growing up, everybody did it and I would grow out of it. I never did. Hair dyed black, hairpiece, lots of thick makeup, not wearing my specs.What has prompted me to write about it at this stage is Susan Boyle. Remember when she first came onto the stage, people ridiculed her, they laughed at her, and they poked fun at her. They judged her on her looks alone. Why is it that people are so judgemental before they know all the facts. Susan admitted to struggling a bit in life, she was bullied, and suffered name calling, something I can well relate to, it happened to me. What an absolute joy when she opened her mouth and sang, finally her dream is coming true. God bless you Susan.Looking back, my BDD started with bullying at school. Of course when you are young you try and get on with things, but a seed is planted waiting to manifest itself later on, in whatever form it may take. In my case I learnt how to cope, some of the time. At this point I will pick out a few phrases from various websites so that you know I am not just talking about bullying but the devastating effects it can have. Dr David Veale.....'Most sufferers are preoccupied with some aspect of their face. Typical concerns are percieved flaws on the face or head. Sufferers may be concerned about a lack of symmetry, too big, too small, or out of proportion.' In my case it is my face. Notice the word 'percieved', for that's what it is, a preoccupation with a percieved defect in one's appearance. Everyone tells you, you look normal, but inside your head you are not. Dr David Veale......'Most sufferers are extremely distressed about their condition and spend several hours a day thinking about it. They remain very anxious and self concious. They monitor and camouflage themselves excessively to hide their percieved defect by using heavy makeup, and brushing their hair in a particular way.' Yes, I did all that. Dr Frederick Penzel.......'People with BDD may be depressed because they cannot convince others of the problem, and not being able to change it no matter what they try. Social isolation is also common.' I will add here that my level of BDD is probably not as high as some people, but I felt cheated that God hadn't given me a normal face. I will explain in the next paragraph.I have grown up hating my face, a bold statement but true. As I said, it started with bullying, my teenage years were hell at times as I struggled to fit in. The swinging sixties were indeed exciting, I dreamt of kissing Paul McCartney, I imagined myself singing on stage like Cilla, walking down the catwalk after Twiggy, I idolised these people. Then I caught sight of myself in the mirror and it caused me great sadness. No matter how I tried to copy their styles, their fashions, and their looks, it always ended in tears. It was hopeless, I would never be pretty. Looking back this knocked my confidence right off track, I thought I wasn't as good as anyone else, I left school to go to work because I did not do well in lessons. Boys did not want to go out with me and I was laughed at if I mentioned to my friends that I liked someone. I was painfully shy, and painfully thin and everything was such a struggle. A turning point came for me when I passed my HGV driving test at 27, and got my first lorry driving job, then I threw myself in at the deep end of working in a male environment. I was engrossed in my new career, so BDD was pushed aside because now I had more important things to think about. It did come to the surface however as the bullying began again, this time from men who hated me. They said I was taking the job off a man, and I should get back to the kitchen sink, in 1976 men were very chauvinistic. Again I cried buckets and blamed it on my face, I was sure that attractive people didn't have these problems. Another turning point came a few years later. I was listening to a programme on Radio 4 about a charity called Changing Faces. I heard the story of James Partridge, a young man who was horrifically burnt in an accident when his landrover turned over and caught fire. He went through many operations and skin grafts to restore his face to some form of normality. I had to stop my lorry to listen, he sounded such a kind and caring man. He started the charity because there was very little help for people with facial disfigurements, after the surgeons had done all they could. I took the phone number down and rang him when I got home. I explained how I hated my face, and asked if I could attend his courses for confidence building. I felt a bit of a fraud really because to the outside world I do not have any facial disfigurements. I explained that my scars are on the inside. He was so understanding and said I would be welcome to meet him. I booked the two day course.I met some lovely people at Changing Faces, and James himself was wonderful, it did my confidence a power of good. I strolled around the streets with him during the lunch break, and I noticed people looking the other way and couldn't think why. When I talked to him I looked through the outer covering to the person inside, and I saw a beautiful man. He put everyone he met at ease, he was so confident, and I wanted to learn how to do that. If you want to meet James he is here....http://www.changingfaces.org.uk/I hope you can now see how pleased I am to see Susan's dream coming true. There is a young lady who also has an uphill struggle to get her life back on track. Katie Piper was attacked by a man who threw acid over her face, she was a pretty young girl with her whole life ahead of her, and it was changed in a few seconds. She still is pretty, but in a different way, look through her skin to see the beautiful person inside. I have just read that Katie will be reading the Alternative Christmas Speech, something I shall be looking forward to hearing. You can read the report here....www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/dec/11/channel-4-alternative-christmas-messageLooking back now, I feel that my face has been the biggest obstacle in my life. I still hate it, that will never go away. There's no getting away from the fact that people do judge you by how you look. The media is to blame for young girls mutilating themselves under the surgeons knife, bigger this, move that, flatten the other. There is an appetite for beauty, but the best beauty of all is the one you can't see."}, {"title": "Henry's sleepover", "date": "Sunday 13 December 2009", "text": "Most of my weekend has been taken up with Henry sitting, he came on Saturday for a sleepover. We had a lot of fun out walking, we met several other dogs which delighted Henry as he romped around with them. I managed to keep him away from dykes full of water thank goodness, so I didn't have to give him a wash down before letting him back in the house.The cats are getting used to him now, Lilly even lets him lick his face, Lilly is a boy by the way :-) There was a bit of commotion this morning though, Henry had followed me upstairs and I was in the bathroom, he stuck his head round the door of the office and didn't notice Bugsy asleep.  Such a kerfuffle, yelps and hissing, Henry knows when to back off though.He is becoming a very clever boy now, I can talk to him and he listens. There are some words that he understands, and if I spend a penny he knows it must be walk time and he sits looking at my jacket hanging on the hook behind the door. Helen forgot to bring his ball so we didn't have anything to play games with, then I remembered he picks up plastic pop bottles in the street and tosses them around, and I had an empty squash bottle in the bin. This did the job of entertaining him perfectly.He was here for 24 hours, just to give Helen and Paul a break, at just over a year old he is very demanding, needing four walks a day and plenty of playtime and fun. It disrupts our routine a bit when he comes, I have to move the cats food dishes upstairs and put a barrier up at the bottom of the stairs, so Henry can't get them. I sleep on a camp bed in the living room, with Henry on a chair, because he wants to be near me. It's nice to have him here for visits, and to help Helen out."}, {"title": "Walk around Blacktoft Sands", "date": "Saturday 12 December 2009", "text": "A couple of weeks ago I went a bike ride over the bridge, and up the other side of the River Trent. I had to cut my journey short because I was going to run out of daylight hours and I had no lights, and my backside and legs were aching. So yesterday I went in the car to see the bits that I missed.Blacktoft Sands is a nature reserve on the south side of the River Ouse about eight miles east of Goole, in East Yorkshire. It has the largest intertidal reedbed in England, and has a fascinating range of birds and other wildlife. There are six observation hides, a reception centre and picnic area. Although I don't know a lot about the different species of birds, I do like looking round these places. It was a lovely sunny but crisp afternoon, the frost was still on the grass where the sun hadn't reached. This is the entrance to the Marshland Hide. Inside are narrow windows all round and benches to sit on while you watch the birds . This is the view from inside the Hide, a barge is passing having unloaded at Goole Docks. It looks a lot closer than it is but it is in the channel beyond and not travelling through the reserve. The sun was setting as I left, I wasn't sure if photo this would turn out ok but I think it's nice."}, {"title": "Not a load of rubbish", "date": "Friday 11 December 2009", "text": "I'm rather pleased with my bag of rubbish. It doesn't look very artistic, it doesn't look pretty, but it is my only bag of household rubbish that went in my grey wheelie bin destined for landfill, in two weeks. Yes this is the total sum of my rubbish that can't be recycled, and I'm proud if it. In fact I tell a lie, there is two empty cartons of soya milk in there, squashed flat. If I want to recycle those I have to drive ten miles there and back to the council dump, not a good idea. Most of it is cat food pouches, bits of plastic wrapping that can't be used for anything else, and one or two labels off tins which I don't have to remove but do, after washing and squashing. Any smallish plastic bags get used for dog poo picking, things like bread bags, insides of cereal packets, and frozen peas bags. As I don't hand pick, I use a small plastic spade, any bag will do.I recycle all my plastics where I can, you have to check on the number in the little triangle that is stamped on the bottom. Sometimes it is so small I have to look closely over the top of my specs. This gets put in the burgundy wheelie bin along with the cardboard. The biggest filler of this bin is the boxes that the cat food pouches come in. I think that is such a waste, why can't they just put 12 pouches in a small plastic bag, then I could use it for dog poo.My plastic boxes for paper, and tins and glass recycling get collected  once a fortnight alternating with the cardboard and plastic, but I only need to put these out once every six weeks. I might have a few cans and a couple of wine bottles, maybe an odd coffee jar or honey jar, but that's about it. My newspaper box has junk mail and the free newspapers, so not much there to collect.So the biggest creator of everyday rubbish in my house is the cats, the other bag that goes into my grey bin is their dirty cat litter. I use the clumping type and try to keep it to a minimum by using the plastic spade to lift out the soiled material, then top up with fresh. Every week I run it down and give the boxes a good scrub out and start again. In this weather they tend to stay indoors more, but in the summer their use of cat litter dramatically reduces and the hedge bottoms get well fertilised.I think my lack of rubbish is down to my frugal living, only buying what I need, and buying simply. Of course the packaging that goods come in is beyond my control, but a lot can be recycled these days, and if you don't buy junk food that cuts a lot of rubbish out. Can you get your rubbish down to one carrier bag for two weeks, like I can?"}, {"title": "Look down now", "date": "Thursday 10 December 2009", "text": "I've made a profit today, must write that in my little book. Today I spent nothing but made a profit. I took Henry  for a walk in the woods, we had a lovely time, he was romping about getting filthy and I was huffing and puffing climbing back up the steep bank to the top.I just happened to look down, being carefull trying not to lose my footing on the wet leaves and twigs and fall buttocks over chest, to put it politely, ha ha. I spied a coin, a very dirty coin it must have been there for a long time. I picked it up, how lucky that I had looked down at precisely that moment in that particular spot. I must have had an angel guiding me, perhaps I have an inbuilt radar which was picking up the signal from this coin.I had been selected from the many people who walk through the woods, to be the one who would have this lucky find. Perhaps it's an omen, fate that I found the coin, perhaps there is more good luck coming my way, how exciting. Maybe tomorrow I ought to go to the shop and put the ten pence coin towards a lottery ticket.  You never know, this could be my lucky break."}, {"title": "Pleasure v Pain", "date": "Wednesday 9 December 2009", "text": "I've just been watching a magazine programe on the iplayer, and one of the stories was about getting help with managing your money when you are struggling to make ends meet. I agree there is a need for the government to fund places where people can go and talk to an advisor about their problems, but I can't help thinking that instead of getting right down to the nitty gritty, they just paper over the cracks.The programe featured two similar stories of hardship, one a single mother bringing up three children on around \u00a3800 of benefits a month, and a pensioner also living on a similar amount. They both have debts of \u00a35,000. They were advised to start writing down every penny they spend in a notebook, so they can see where their money is going, something I think everybody should be doing regardless of whether they need to or not. Even people who earn a lot of money can easily find their spending spiraling out of control if they don't monitor it.The camera followed the mum of three as she did her shopping, and she talked about seeing things she liked but couldn't have them because she couldn't afford it. She picked up an aerosol can, looked at it and put it back on the shelf, to illustrate her point. I thought that was a good sign, at least she was trying to keep her spending in check. But later she said she spent \u00a3300 on each of her children at Christmas, and got them a large present as well. Now I can see how she got herself in debt.One thing that baffles me is why some people don't understand the difference between luxuries and necessities, because if they did they would be halfway to solving their problems. If you see something and think, I wish I could buy that, wouldn't it be better not to look in the first place? If you can't afford something and it causes you a lot of sadness and you think you are being deprived of a fundemental right to own that object, you are close on to becoming a slave of consumerism.When I say look at the nitty gritty of spending, I mean an indepth conversation about why you want to buy objects that you could well live without. To discuss each individual item, what makes you want to buy it, is it because everyone else has one, is it because you are in the habit of always putting it in your shopping trolley just because it's there, is it pressure from other family members to get one, or is it because the supermarket with their, 'in your face', displays make it scream out, 'buy me'.Another thing to look at is the value an item has for you if you buy it. Will it make your life 100% better? Will it give you many years of fun and entertainment, or will you get bored with it in six months and give it to a charity shop? If it is a large purchase you could also work out how many hours you have to work to cover the cost of it, will it be worth all the toil? Or if you live on a pension as I do, how many weekly payments will I have to forfeit in order to pay for it. It's all about balancing the value of the item with how much pleasure it will give you, and how much pain it will inflict on your finances. Is it worth it?It has become second nature to me to question all my purchases before I part with any money. There has to be a good enough reason for me to open my purse, and the biggest reason is that I need it. It's not good enough to think, 'that would be nice', or 'I fancy that'. I know some people would eat chocolate every day, but for me it is an ocassional treat. Yes I did fancy it, but I savour the sensation, it gives me an uplifting experience and makes me feel good about life. So you see you don't need to deprive yourself from all life's little pleasures, just work out exactly what you need and what you can afford."}, {"title": "Somewhere in the middle", "date": "Tuesday 8 December 2009", "text": "I can't decide where I fit in any more. I feel young but I am not young, I look younger than my years (so I'm told), I am not old and certainly don't feel old. My head thinks I am 29 but I look more like 50. I've done a lot of living but I've still more to do, so I must be somewhere in the middle.I know I'm not a teenager because I don't like their music, and I don't go out on a Saturday night to drink myself silly and throw up everywhere. But I know I'm not old because I don't wear cardigans and pearls, and play bingo down the club.What's brought all this on you might ask. Well, I went out today to the DHL Retired Employees Christmas Dinner, very nice it was, in a local pub. It's the first time I have ever been, they meet three times a year for a meal and a natter. Everyone was very friendly, they made me feel most welcome, but I can't get my head round the fact that I am a pensioner. Looking around I realised I was the youngest person there, and I felt completely out of place.So where do I go to meet people like me?

My living room tables were disappearing under masses of crafting bits and bobs, a sort out definately needed. One table is against the back wall under the window where the cats sit in the sun, that's when we get any. They jump on the chair, then onto the table and climb onto the window sill, leaving a trail of cat hairs floating around. I decided to strip everything off the table and pull it out so that I could clean behind the radiator. The tablecloth started life as a bed sheet, I opened it out and gave it a good shake outside and refolded it with a clean side on the outside, and put it back on again, no point in washing it untill all sides are dirty.Most of my housework consists of a quick whip round with the Dyson once a month, but today I decided to do my thorough six monthly job by getting down on my hands and knees and using the hose with the attachment, to get right into the corners. When you get your face down near the carpet, especially a dark coloured floral carpet like mine, you can see all the bits you have missed when Dysoning standing up.I put the table and chairs back when I had cleaned underneath, and put the items on a tray on the table rather than have them scattered everywhere. By this time I was getting fed up of cleaning and decided to leave the rest of the room for another day.Last week I bought a bag of plastic shower curtain rings from a charity shop for 50p. Today I got my spare curtains out of the cupboard and used the rings to hang them on top of the curtains already up. This gives it an extra thickness, hopefully keeping it a bit warmer inside, well it would be warm if I actually put the heating on. I am determined to soldier on without it, only flicking the switch if I am absolutely freezing cold. At the moment I am back to my old habit of last winter, of wearing loads of clothes indoors, including coat, scarf, and gloves. This morning I washed my hair in the kitchen sink with two kettles of hot water. The rinse water was still quite clean when I finished so I got a floor cloth and got down on my hands and knees and washed the kitchen floor. Might as well get some more use out of it before I pour it down the sink.I've just remembered, I'm getting a free Christmas dinner tomorrow, only I shall be having the vegetarian option.

It's a pleasant bit of chitter chatter and I can be getting on with other jobs while I listen. Some of the story lines are very emotional, especially the one at the moment about Jack Woolley going into a care home. Peggy his wife was becoming worn out, because his advancing dementure is becoming too much for her to cope with. Now he seems settled in and has a few of his personal possessions around him, poor Peggy now has the guilt to cope with, leaving him in a prison, as she put it. It reminds me of an incident some years ago, my brother in law had an elderly aunt and uncle in their late eighties living in a care home in Lancashire. They wanted to move to the Midlands so that my sister and her husband could visit more often. A place was found and a date was set to move them. My brother in law hired a box trailer and I went with them to help with loading and unloading the furniture.I remember it clearly, we were ready to leave, checking we had picked everything up, and the elderly couple settled comfortably in the car. I was shocked, we only had half a trailer load. Surely there should be more, went through my mind, is this all you end up with after living on this planet for almost ninety years. It made me very sad that this small pile of possessions was all they had left to show for a long life. That image of the half full trailer has stayed with me, will that be all I have left as well.Now, several years later I see things differently, I look around my house and think someone else will have to remove this eventually, so why not make a start now. Don't put the burden onto whoever is left, they will probably throw most of it in a skip anyway, but gradually wind it down, sort it out, and pass it on to someone who will make good use of it. Recycle now before it is too late, this could be the answer to save the planet. When all the shops have nothing left to sell and close their doors, and I do believe that will happen eventually, that's when we start reusing all our old stuff. Then everyone will realise why we are all here. Pity I won't be around to see it happen.If I can end up with half a trailer load that will be fine, that's my bit done  After all, we don't own actually own anything, it is all borrowed and we just give it back.

I had it in mind to try and get in the festive spirit and visit the big Christmas Market in Lincoln, it really is spectacular. But the thought of being squashed amongst thousands of visitors and herded around like sheep, peering over peoples heads trying to get a look at the stalls, just didn't appeal. So I went for my second choice, the healthy option.I arrived at Donna Nook just after midday, and although there was a lot of people about I managed to get a place in the car park. You wont find Donna Nook in a road atlas because the road leading up to it is a dead end before you fall into the sea. It is near the village of North Somercotes, half way between Cleethorpes and Mablethorpe on the Lincolnshire coast. It is home to an RAF bombing range, but that wasn't what I had come to see. This is also a Wildlife Trust nature reserve, and every year at this time hundreds of seals come onto the sand dunes to give birth. It has one of the largest and most accessible breeding colonies of the grey seal in the UK. From 27th October to 30th November, 1,082 pups have been born. The conditions for them are ideal here, mainly saltmarshes, inter-tidal mudflats, and sandbanks. You can walk along a footpath which is separated by a fence from the breeding area. The seals come very close, it's very tempting to reach out and touch the pups, but you must not, because the mothers would smell your scent and abandon them. It's a wonderful sight, those gorgeous big eyes just melt your heart.  Leaving Donna Nook I decided to vist the Seal Sanctuary at Mablethorpe ten miles down the coast. There is a hospital for rescued seals, some of them have been caught up in fishing nets, and are at various stages of treatment. Eventually when they make a full recovery they will be released back into the wild. They have two permanent residents that have been there since 1986, they can't be released because they are both blind, so they will live out their days at the sanctuary. I think my second choice was much better, don't you? I hope you like my photos.

I eat lots of vegetables, probably too much and nothing else. I can be a bit obsessed about not eating any junk food at all, but maybe a little bit wouldn't be so bad. I must try and introduce a bit more variety into my meals, so this is what I bought today, and some of the reasons for my choices.6 pieces of frozen salmon for \u00a34.50, that is 75p per piece, so I should be able to keep within my \u00a31 per meal limit if I add some veg.6 pieces of frozen tuna steaks for \u00a33.69, that's 73p per piece so again it keeps it down to \u00a31.2.5k potatoes for 99p.A savoy cabbage for 29pA huge butternut squash for 49pBroccoli 33pPack of six custard tarts reduced from \u00a31 to 65p. One thing that bothers me about them is that I don't think they use free range eggs. I will have to cope with the guilt but I wouldn't buy them at full price.2 frozen fish pies at \u00a31 each. I don't normally buy processed ready meals but they are handy to have now and then if you don't feel like cooking. I put extra frozen peas or sweetcorn in them before I microwave them, to bulk it up a bit.2 large pots of organic yoghurt at \u00a31 each. I normally buy six small pots for \u00a31, but I got the large ones because they are probiotic and are supposed to be better for you. I will try and spin them out into six portions per pot so it won't be any more expensive than the single ones.A small cheese and tomato pizza for 46p. A bit sparse with the topping but I shall add a few extras to make it a meal for under \u00a31. Pizzas are never usually on my shopping list.A packet of choc digestive biscuits for 33p, Tesco Value brand. Don't tell me off, I never buy biscuits, but I fancied a bit of chocolate and the biscuits are a cheaper option. I will try and make them last me the week.Wholemeal loaf reduced from 66p to 46pPacket of 6 oatcakes for 39p. These will make 3 lunches, fill with cheese and tomato and microwave, scrummy.Packet of 6 potato cakes, reduced from 43p to 25p. I haven't had these before but they were cheap. I will toast them with a topping for lunch.Litre of soya milk, sadly full price \u00a31.26, no special offer this week.Small vegetable quiche for 95p, it will be over the \u00a31 if I can't find something for 5p to add to it. Just had a thought, I have some cuppa soups which were 5p each so that would just about do it then.Most of my shopping was cat food, Tesco have a special offer on, Felix As Good As It Looks for \u00a33 instead of \u00a34.34, so I stocked up with a few boxes, the cats get better fed than I do. I usually buy this from the market at \u00a32.99 but they have run out, when Tesco put theirs back up again I shall be back to the market to see if they have had a delivery.My next shopping trip will be in about two weeks when I shall use a \u00a33 off voucher for my tins and packets, I will be needing some more bran flakes by then.I also had a little treat today, I wanted to get the Susan Boyle CD, but couldn't justify buying something I didn't need. So I got round my little dilema by using my points vouchers which I had saved up, after all they were given to me and I still have plenty left. The CD cost me 65p plus \u00a39 in vouchers. I've just been playing it, it's lovely, so pleased I got it.Good morning, another new day another fresh start. I awoke this morning and remembered what I have to do today, take my car to the garage for them to assess the damage inflicted upon it yesterday. Now I have had time to mull things over in my mind I can't help wondering why pick my car out of several others that were parked in the street. Was it someone who knows me, possibly someone who wants to hurt me. I don't normally make enemies but you can never tell what goes on in someone's deranged mind. I have one or two suspicions, but of course with no witnesses and no cctv cameras, I am unable to follow it up. The police are going to make some enquiries but I don't expect them to make any arrests.I remember many years ago I was shocked and horrified when someone I knew said he had done exactly the same thing to a car which had parked quite legally outside his house. It had annoyed him so he thought he would teach the owner a lesson so they wouldn't park there again. He got his come uppance though, several months later we met up and went for a coffee. On our return to the car park someone had scratched the side of his car. He was quite annoyed by it, I kept my mouth shut, muttering under my breath, you reap what you sow. Now he wasn't a dodgy character at all, in fact he held a very responsible position working in partnership with the police force. His behaviour was not what you would expect from someone who was held with high regard. It just goes to show, you don't know what is going on in someone's mind.Anyway time to move on, no point in crying over spilt milk, there are people who have many more worries than I do. I just heard on the news about a young man who who was also the victim of a violent act yesterday, only he paid for it with his life. Someone had tried to grab his laptop, he tried to stop them and was shot in the stomach by the assailant, he subsequently died. A tragic story. It puts everything into perspective, I may be \u00a3100 lighter, but I still have my life. So sorry for the young man and his family."}, {"title": "Thank goodness for cats", "date": "Thursday 3 December 2009", "text": "There are some days when I would like to live as far away as possible from other human beings, and today is one of those days. Sometime between 2pm and 2.20pm today, my car was vandalised. Someone decided they would have a bit of fun and scrape down the side with a sharp instrument, I think they generally use a key. From front to back there is a wavy scratch, down to the metal, and the whole side will have to be resprayed.What goes through someone's mind when they do that? Why pick on my car? I was parked at the back of the Scrapstore after unloading some stuff I had collected from a couple of businesses, doing my bit of voluntary work. I had a cup of coffee and a chat and came out to find that some pathetic excuse for a human being had decided to land me with a bill for \u00a3100 and an insurance claim. I feel as if I have been personally attacked myself, I feel very saddened that there are a lot of evil nasty people roaming about, and I do despair at what is happening in the world.Thank goodness for cats. No matter how angry or upset I am, I still have Lilly and Freddie both trying to sit on my knee as I type this. I have already given up my comfortable office chair for Lilly to sit on and I am on a hard dining room chair, but no that isn't enough, he has climbed onto the desk, gone round the back of the computer, and is now balanced once again on my knee.

I find that very hard to believe. Mark Boyle is 28 and lives in a borrowed caravan on an organic farm near Bristol, he volunteers his services on the farm, presumably to cover his rent and access to a clean water supply.It sounds all very romantic, living off your own means without the burden of modern day stresses and strains, but I'm sure if you asked homeless people living on the streets, they wouldn't think it was an ideal situation to be in at all. If you have no money coming in you have to rely on the goodness of others to help you out, which to me sounds a bit selfish if your situation is self imposed. If you plan to barter your services in exchange for food, light, heat etc, then that is more acceptable, but there are bound to be people who feel sorry for you and donate something out of the goodness of their heart. At what point does this turn into begging?As you know I do believe you can live off very little money, but I would not like to live off no money at all. I tried living in a caravan once, though I did have a paid job, my house was sold and the money was in the bank waiting to buy another. It was quite nice not to have to pay utility bills, council tax, or mortgage. My job was a short pleasant walk down the road to the cement works, I could shower there when the day was finished before I walked back to make my dinner.The downside was that after a few months I ran out of clean clothes and bedding, no launderette in the middle of the countryside. I got fed up of the cramped kitchen, no room to make decent meals, no fridge, and the condensation inside made everything damp. It was also very lonely, I used to go walking a lot just to get out and meet people, and then it got to November and it was so cold I went to bed as soon as I had my dinner at 6pm. Then I bought another house.As an experiment, I believe living without money is something everyone should do for a while, it certainly makes you think about what is important in life. I could easily not buy anything for a week, or even maybe a month, I would have to stock up on cat food though, my boys have to be fed. Another experiment I would like to see is for all the shops, cafe's, restaurants, and retail outlets, to close one day a week, let's go back to six day trading. Wouldn't it be nice if families did something together on a Sunday instead of traipsing round Tesco's.

Their striking colours caught my eye as I rummaged through the bric a brac box on the floor. I had to wash them first as they were a bit dusty and it took couple of days to dry them, blowing in the wind outside on the line, as they have some kind of brown hessian inside them. I started off by cutting them into 28inch lengths, this was just a guess. Then I hemmed all the ends up, at this stage I wasn't sure whether to make the stripes horizontal or vertical. Next I joined all the stripes together with a zigzag stitch on the machine, they are too thick to overlap them. This gave me a flat piece so I joined the two ends to make a circle. I hand stitched this seam because it was slightly crooked, and because of it's bulk I couldn't use the machine. I kept two pieces back for the handles. I had to sew the handles on by hand, and I used string to do it. I covered the handsewn vertical seam with one of the orange handles to disguise it. I just need to hand sew across the bottom now, I shall do it with string to match the handles. I took the photo first as it stands up nicely on the worktop. It measures 14.5 inches across and 12 inches deep. I have about five inches of yellow left over so I might make a fastener with it and add some velcro.

I see the shopping frenzy has begun, I hate town centres on a Saturday. The council has been advertising an ice skating rink in the main square, and as I still have my boots from many moons ago (I used to work at the ice rink in Blackpool), I thought I would take a look. Of course I didn't expect real ice, but this was pathetic, what a rip off. A small platform covered in plastic blocks which didn't look remotely slippery at all. The kids were having fun walking around on their blades and no doubt were enjoying their erm...'ice skating' experience. Price per adult was \u00a33 for 20 minutes, but I didn't see any adults daft enough to pay that.I went to the market for my cat food, the cheapest place round here, and it's always a good idea to walk round the veg stalls in the afternoon because they are keen to get rid of their perishable stock. I have a good stash of vegetables at the moment in the freezer, amongst other things beans from the garden, and I bought a big bag of carrots last week and froze them into single portions. But I did spot a bargain I couldn't resist, ten large bananas for 50p.I am starting up my little accounts book again which I keep in my kitchen drawer, I need to record where all my money goes. I did it for a while but then stopped because I became so disciplined with my spending, I never spend more than I earn, or in my case, receive from my pension. I find this is a good way to keep focused on money matters. Not that I am becoming a spendaholic or anything, no chance of that, it's just that I have had a lot to pay out just lately. Car mot, tax and insurance, computer went wobbly again and Mark had to come and sort it, and the utility bills will be rolling in soon now the meters have been read.I scrutinise my bank statements constantly, and always get a balance slip when I visit the hole in the wall, and always inside the bank never outside. My last big treat was my walking boots a few weeks ago, there won't be any more big treats now untill the new year, I need to build up my money buffer in the bank. Looking at the long term my car will need replacing eventually so that will be my priority in a couple of years. I'm thinking six to seven grand for that, and it will be cash, I don't do credit.So my little cash book now comes into play again. I won't be going short on good wholesome food, because contrary to what people think, it costs very little to eat decent fresh food. I am a living testament to that, my health is good, my weight is right, all because I take the time to prepare food from scratch. My winter veggie stews are lovely at this time of the year, and cheap to make."}, {"title": "Craftycats", "date": "Friday 27 November 2009", "text": "I've got a few craft projects on the go at the moment, some in various stages of completion and some are a figment of my imagination. I have been so engrossed with ideas swimming around in my head, that other things have taken a back seat. I actually forgot to go and help out at the Scrapstore the other day, luckily they had some other volunteers they could rely on. I must remember to take a note book with me when I go out so I can write down any dates I need to remember, then transfer it onto my calendar when I get home.Remember the stone I made a dark blue crochet cover for, and stitched some pearl beads onto? I wondered what to do next. I covered some more stones in various colours, then I came up with the idea of making a rock pool with them. I can visualise them on a plate also covered in crochet, in greens and blues to give the appearance of water. The stones would have plant life growing on them as in a real rock pool. So far I have used cut up zips, shredded plastic rope, plastic pen tops, beads and buttons to add sea flowers and plants. I'm not telling you any more I don't want to spoil it, you will have to wait for the finished article which might take a couple of weeks or more. I bought three quite thick, long fabric belts in green, yellow, and orange, for 30p each from the charity shop. I didn't know what they were untill someone told me they are judo belts. When I saw them I thought, aha, a bag. Watch this space. I have made some more crochet beads and I'm in the process of stringing them together to make a necklace. I want to add something else to them to make it a bit more interesting, still thinking about that. I have also brought down the small coffee table I made ages ago out of cat food boxes, it was tucked away in the spare room. I was getting a bit fed up with it because I couldn't get the surfaces flat and level, but then I thought, why does it have to be perfect, I could leave it all lumpy and bumpy, as long as a cup or glass can stand on it without toppling over. So now I want to finish it off with Felix cat food pouches all over it, but I am struggling to find the right substance to stick them on with. I have tried three types of glue but no joy. I don't want to spend lots of money on glue because that defeats the object of it being made out of rubbish. I have an idea to ask a man that makes vinyl covers for lorries, he uses glue that might work. I have been struggling to get onto my two crafting tables, everytime I sit down to do some work the cats want to join in.

There was a music quiz but I didn't join in, I am hopeless at quizzes. I purchased a pint of cider and a packet of crisps. Shock horror, the price of it. Cider \u00a32.70, I got a four can pack from Tesco for \u00a32. Packet of crisps 65p, I got a multipack (12 packets) from Tesco for 47p. No wonder everyone's recycling bins are full of empty cans and bottles. I did read the paper though, so that saved me 36p, ha ha.I've been thinking of this simple life I have, maybe it's becoming a tad too simple, maybe if you don't use your brain very much it turns into cotton wool. What is it the experts say, use it or lose it? I always seem to shut down at this time of year anyway, shorter days, thinking it would be nice to hibernate, everything takes a lot more effort in the winter. I could very easily become a slob.Looking around me there is plenty to do, a bit of dusting, dysoning the carpets, cleaning the windows, but I can't be bothered. I'll leave it till the spring. I know someone who lives in a junk yard, it reminds me of Steptoe's house if you can remember the sit com from years ago. Steptoe was a rag and bone man who went out in his horse and cart to collect scrap. I am not exagerating here, she collects junk. Each to their own I suppose, but I couldn't live with all that clutter, an utter nightmare not being able to find anything. Her life is very complicated, she tries to juggle job, child, clubs, dog, no wonder she is always worn out. I tell her to get a skip and get rid of all her junk, she says she will, but never does, some people are like that I suppose.So back to my house. I keep things simple by periodically sorting out, then take a bag or two to the charity shop. Once it's gone out of the house I forget all about it, forget I ever owned it, forget I ever saw it.Sometimes things coming into the house hardly get past the front door. Like junk mail for instance. My paper recycling cupboard is just inside the kitchen, the leaflets from companies I have no interest in go straight in there. I might scan the supermarket ones to see if there is anything I need to buy, but nine times out of ten the special offers are on junk food. Any unsolicited sales letters which have my name and address on them, have my personal details ripped from the top and go in the shredder, the rest goes to recycle. Do not put any bits of paper in the recycle which have any personal details on them which might identify you. I still get paper bills so they go on the notice board in the office with the date they have to be paid, highlighted so I don't forget.The man came yesterday to read the electric meter which is hidden behind a cupboard. I have to move it away from the wall so he can have access.

I always call in to view the latest exhibits, I just wish they would change them more often. The work of Susan Bowman is on show outside in the courtyard untill March next year. She uses mainly ladies undergarments with some camisole tops, and turns them into invisible people by moulding them to the shape of the female form, and preserving them in resin. They are rock hard and able to withstand the elements for a long period of time, an idea which I find fascinating, to turn something soft to the touch into a virtual suit of armour.They stand independently on their plinths, a group of invisible women, gathered together, waiting, chattering maybe. Who knows, they may even come alive when darkness fills the skies.

I used to take part in Christmas, not any more, it's too much hassle. Hours trawling the shops for suitable gifts for friends and family. Worrying myself to death about getting something they might like, I am hopeless at Christmas shopping, oh the misery of it all! I have the answer, don't do it.I will send a few family cards, and one to my best friend. What is the point of sending cards to people you don't have any contact with all year. I would much rather pick up the phone and have a chat, and if they don't ring me that's fine. I might give away some of my home made things, but I will definately not be battling my way round the shops filling my bag with cheap tat, or spending ridiculous amounts of money just because everyone else is and just because it's Christmas.The same few decorations will come out of the box again, a small tree, some coloured lights, a few baubles. My food won't be much different from what I eat all the year round, I might get a small cake, and make a trifle. I'll treat the cats to a bit of chicken, and might even have a mad moment and treat myself to a small bottle of Pernod ;-oThis is my least favourite time of the year, lets just get it over and done with.

I had a great day out at Harrogate yesterday, the Knit and Stitch Show was very popular judging by the crowds that came pouring in from the many coaches arriving. I got there at just gone eleven, after abandoning my car in a side street on the outskirts of town and hopping on a bus.I declined the invitation to buy a \u00a33 brochure after parting with my \u00a311 entrance fee, and waded into the crowds elbowing for space to view the goodies on offer. Of course without a floor plan the only way I could make sure I saw it all was to methodically walk up and down every aisle. My reason for going there was to search for new ideas to inspire me, but after an hour or so of seeing nothing but trade stands flogging their wares, I wondered if I had wasted my time. It was ok if you wanted to buy fabric, wool, and crafting materials, or spend \u00a3250 on a machine that punches six holes in fabric over and over again. I sat down next to a lady who was supposed to be giving knitting lessons, and tucked into my sandwiches. I think she was happy just to chat with me. Nearby was a full size boat which had been covered in knitting, including all the bits and pieces you would associate with it, all knitted. For the life of me I cannot understand why women take so long to go to the toilet, for goodness sake, don't they faff about! There were long queues, 99% of visitors were women so it was to be expected. Eventually some bright spark came up with the good idea of sticking a sign up on the door of the Gents, immediately turning it into a Ladies, but not before I had already been in there to miss the queue, I don't faff around, in and out in a jiffy, ha ha. In the next hall I found what I had come to see, the exhibition side of the show. This was better, a gallery of artists showing their work. I had a chat to a very talented lady, Jill Flower, she is a textile artist who stitches paper and adds beads and buttons. Her work is stunning. It is difficult to explain and you need to see it close up to appreciate the hours she puts into it. I didn't take any photographs because they wouldn't have done it justice, but I urge you to look at her web site. http://www.jillflower.com/Most of the exhibits had 'No Photography', notices close by, but I did ask permission to take these. Backpack, boots, flask, and sandwiches, all knitted.A knitted dustbin with it's contents spilling out.As you know I am more interested in making things out of rubbish, the world is awash with the stuff, there really is no need to to buy your crafting materials. There seemed to be a frenzy of activity around the trade stands so I had a quick look to see if I should treat myself to something. I have to say there was nothing that caught my eye. The only thing that did interest me was the huge wooden knitting needles, I thought I could perhaps rip up an old blanket and knit it into a rug. But then it crossed my mind that I could possibly make the knitting needles out of an old broom handle I have in the shed. So I didn't buy a thing. The quilts were fabulous, I would never have the patience to take on such a huge project. One exhibit that was very powerful which sticks in my mind was part of a display of the deterioration of the human body after death. Centre piece was Jesus on the cross, resembling nothing more than a skeleton draped with fragments of cloth. On the opposite wall was twelve rough pieces of wood, about 6\" x 12\", set vertically. Nailed on each one was a glove which look as old as if they had been on the hand of Christ. They had been torn to shreds but were still obviously gloves, and treated with some kind of plaster and resin. A very powerful image. The last two photo's I took are clever ideas with rubbish. Someone drank a lot of Guiness to make this wall hanging. Each aluminium can has been painstakingly cut up and stitched together onto a fabric backing. It's about the size of a single bed sheet. An idea I might try, smaller version of course. This picture is made out of woven, knitted, and crochet, plastic carrier bags. The more I view artwork, the more I realise I have to move further outside the box. Each one of the exhibits have their written signs next to them explaining the artists thinking when they create them. More often than not the jargon means nothing to me, I am drawn to certain pieces only because I like the look of them. Getting inside someones head is one of the most complex activities ever, I wonder if I should even bother to try, or am I missing out on the true enjoyment of art. Oh, I almost forgot, I met another Ilona, she was selling beads. They are coming thick and fast now."}, {"title": "Just go", "date": "Friday 20 November 2009", "text": "I'm looking forward to sleeping in my bed tonight, after spending five nights on a camp bed in my living room.  I have been looking after Henry 24/7 since Sunday afternoon, and there was no way I could leave him even for a few minutes, he wanted to be by my side the whole time. He has gone home now, collected by Helen at 6pm. I was a little bit sad to see him go, but I can now relax as I  have my life back.I found the experience mentally and physically demanding. He is such a strong boy, and not yet fully trained so I was dragged round the streets everytime we went for a walk. I used the Halti collar as well as his normal one, which helped a little, but never the less I feel totally exhausted by it all. I am having problems with the muscle in my upper right arm, getting sharp pains when I reach for something. This has been building up for a long time from my lorry driving days, and now I find it painfull to use the mouse for any length of time, all part of old age I suppose. I mentioned mentally demanding because I am unfamiliar with the concept of sharing my life with anyone, man or beast, that expects my full attention. I know I have the cats, but we rub along nicely together, I feed and cuddle them and they do their own thing.Commitment to another human being frightens the hell out of me, it always has done, and now I know I could not take on a dog full time either. Life just seems so simple when you are on your own. I am going to the Knit and Stitch Show tomorrow at Harrogate. I dont have to ask anyone, dont have to make arrangements for dog sitters or child minders, or deal with sulky husband, just walk out of the door and go.

It's quite manic here at the moment, Henry gets very upset if I dont give him my undivided attention, omg, now he is eating the paper, just a minute while I remove it from his mouth. Bugsy cat is in his hideaway in the spare room, Lilly is asleep on my bed, and Freddie is glaring at Henry from the safe haven in the window sill.Freddie gave Henry a hissy fit warning not long after he arrived, which was a good thing because Henry now knows who is top cat, and gives them all a wide berth. We all get up at 7am, and as soon as I have brushed my teeth and fed the cats, we go out for the first toilet walk, me being dragged down the road. It's only Wednesday and I am exhausted, my shoulders ache, in fact I ache all over. I am using his new halti collar on him now, he doesn't like it very much, but at least it reduces some of the pulling.It isn't all hard work, well not quite. I keep reminding myself he is only a baby and he will be missing his mummy, he makes me laugh sometimes. We went to town yesterday, he loved sitting outside the library watching everyone walk by, a few came to stroke him. You are never alone with a dog.Sorry this is a bit rushed, but everytime he is quite for a few minutes I have to get up and see what mischief he is up to.

I've found a pallet that just needs a bit sawing off it and a couple of slats adding. That should do the trick.

I started gathering bits and pieces together for a book a while ago, but I seem to have come to a halt, sometimes the words just dont flow. This tale is from my time at Leicester Heavy Haulage, hope it makes you titter.Whenever I hear the song \u2018Three Wheels on my Wagon\u2019, I think of the time when two of my trailer wheels decided they were going no further, and took a diversion into the woods on the side of the A75, while I was en route to Stranraer. Colin and myself had picked up a couple of heavy lumps of machinery, bound for Belfast, they were loaded on low step frame trailers. We were booked onto the 5pm boat and had timed the journey to the docks just right, only a few miles to go. I felt a little jolt but thought I had maybe run over a pothole in the road. Suddenly my CB radio bursts into life, Colin, who had been behind me all the way, was yelling at me, \u201cThere\u2019s something funny going on with your back wheels, pull over.\u201d Luckily there was a layby just ahead so I swiftly steered into it. We got out to check my trailer, something was missing, there was a gaping hole where there should have been two wheels. The middle axle on the nearside of the trailer had dropped down to within an inch of the road surface because it now had no wheels to support it. We looked up and down the road, no sign of the runaways. I dropped the trailer and we carried on to the docks, we needed to tell them of our delay, and to get some help. Colin discovered that he couldn\u2019t board the boat because his load was too high, so we were both booked onto the next one due to leave the following morning. I rang Jim, the transport manager, and we were instructed to go back to my trailer and search for the missing wheels, in the meantime he would arrange for a tyre company to come out and put them back on for us. It was getting dark by this time and I was beginning to see the funny side of the situation, singing \u2018Three Wheels on my Wagon\u2019, while staggering about in a pitch black wood, with a small flashlight. Talk about looking for a needle in a haystack. \u201cI\u2019ve found one,\u201d I shouted excitedly as I pushed it up to the road, but we didn\u2019t find the other. The tyre man turned up and said he couldn\u2019t put just one wheel on, there had to be two, but he did have a plan to get me going, he asked me for a chain. He jacked the axle up so that it was raised off the ground, he attached the end of the chain, with a shackle, to a hook on the edge of the trailer on the opposite side. Then he took the chain across the bed of the trailer and underneath the lame axle, bringing it back across. Then, with a tensioner he attached the other end to an anchor point on the trailer and tightened it up. He lowered the jack, and hey presto, it worked. The dangly axle was supported by the chain, and I was able to complete the journey to the docks, get on the boat to Belfast, and drive for an hour to the destination.  When we finally delivered our loads we got the crane driver to lift my trailer onto the back of Colins, he took it piggy-back and I followed him in my tractor unit back to the depot. It's a good job I had a lot of wheels, when you start off with twenty you can afford to lose a couple, ha ha."}, {"title": "Show support for homemade", "date": "Friday 13 November 2009", "text": "For saying I don't do much shopping, I sure do have a lot of shopping bags now! Here is the sixth one, just finished. Think I'll start a competition, how many shopping bags can you make from a gazebo roof. I still have some material left so look out for number seven. I am rather proud to show my bags off now when I go through the checkouts, the till ladies show great interest in them. I thought I would make this one with bold lettering, to show my support for home made. I cut the letters out of a piece of fabric used for making blinds, it doesn't fray so it is ideal for stitching straight onto something without having to hem it first. I used red embroidery thread and deliberately made the stitches large to emphasise the home made look. The size of this one is 13\" x 11\" x 7\". I like the handy size box shape as I am very particular how I pack my shopping. Having bags of different sizes means you don't damage anything because they don't fall over in the car, if you pack properly they stay upright. Smaller heavier items can go in the smaller bags, and things like boxes of cereals can go in the bigger bags. The handles are strong and firmly attached and can easily cope with the weight. Much better than those floppy flimsy plastic bags that spew their contents all over the place.

Remember the 32 tyres I found dumped in a ditch? Well there are eleven more now, totalling 43. I rang the council again, third phone call, and the environmental health chappie said a contractor has been to inspect the site and has tendered a price to remove and dispose of them. They will do the job next week. I thought that was a bit strange and asked why one of their own vehicles could not be sent to pick them up. He said they would still have to pay for disposal at an authorised site, so it was cheaper if they paid an outside company to do it. I wonder how many other jobs they contract out?   A leaflet came through the door the other day advertising a new Cash and Carry which has recently opened. It's on the way to town so I stopped to have a look at what they are selling. It's a small warehouse full of food stuffs, pet food, household and toiletries. Some of the prices were really cheap, the catch is that a lot of the stock is out of date, or least popular flavours and varieties which haven't sold in the bigger shops. I filled my basket for \u00a39.50 with packets and tins. Putting dates on food is the best thing they ever did, but the other week I read in the press that they were considering stopping the practice because people are throwing too much food away. I hope they dont because I dont mind eating out of date food, especially if I can get it cheaper.In all my sixty years I have only ever spoken to one other Ilona on the phone, and met another in person. It was lovely to find people with the same name as me, and ask about their experiences of living with an unusual handle. I seem to have had more difficulties than they have with explaining the pronounciation of it. Their English version is much simpler than the German version my mother taught me. It is natural for me to say it with a German accent, but then no one can understand it.This week I have spoken to another Ilona. I found her on the internet and she lives in Glasgow, but guess what, we also have the same surname, how cool is that! It was exciting, I rang the number and asked to speak to myself, ha ha. The woman replied, 'speaking,' and repeated her name. I said 'hello, I am also Ilona.' It was lovely chatting to her.

Some may even think I'm from another planet. My straight forward black and white ideas, and my simplistic solutions to everyday complications seem to baffle them. I am an ideal candidate to embrace a simple lifestyle.For a long time now I have understood the concept of choice. Each one of us has the mechanics, the information, and the capacity to learn, to enable us to make informed choices on how to live our lives, yet many follow blindly the path taken by millions and ignore the junctions which veer off in another direction.I am not a fan of making decisions, so I take the simplistic way out by eliminating everything that is not important to me. For example, my house could do with some new decoration, but I wouldn't know which wall paper to pick, so I simply live with what I have, it's not important. I simplify my food shopping by not going down half the aisles of the supermarket. I eat what is good for me, no need to go down cakes and biscuits.I stay with the same insurance broker for my car insurance, because I know they will find me the best deal. I have tried looking myself but no one else came up with anything better. I don't flit around the utilities trying to get gas and electric a bit cheaper, because they are all as bad as each other. The simple solution for me is black and white, use less and you pay less.I dumped the TV because I could see no usefull purpose for it except to take up too much of my valuable time. I will not be dictated to by a box, simple choice. I don't have to buy a TV programme magazine, don't have to scour through it to find something that is slightly interesting to watch, and don't have to organise the rest of my time around it. Simple.I have no fear of receiving bills I cannot pay, because I simply don't buy what I cannot afford. The word 'overdraft', is alien to me, I have never asked for one so I would not know how to get one. Overdraft puts the fear of God in me, it is spending someone else's money, so why would I want to do that? I would have to pay it back. Black and white answer, earn more or spend less.I build simplicity into every aspect of my life, I don't have to think about it, it comes naturally. Ask me a question and I will give you a simple answer.

I thought it best to keep them upstairs while Henry had the run of the groundfloor, although he could see them if they ventured onto the top stair. He wagged his tail with glee and barked a few times, when Lilly peeped between the railings on the landing. It's a good job I put a barrier at the bottom of the stairs or he would have been up there like a shot to play with his new friend.The fireworks last night were a bit of a pain, the cats hide because they are frightened, so I put the radio on loud, and the lights on. I took Henry for a walk at 4pm, and again at 9pm, when hopefully most of them had finished.Henry is used to sleeping in the bedroom, I hadn't the heart to turf the cats out of there, so I decided to sleep on the settee, because I knew Henry would not settle on his own. All started ok, then Henry became restless, he kept changing his mind and alternating between the floor and the chair. The next thing, he launched himself onto me, we lay together for five minutes squashed onto the two seater settee. I finally gave up as my back was beginning to ache, and I made my bed on the floor, at last Henry is happy and I got to sleep.Up at seven, out for a walk at quarter past, no time for a drink, Henry is whimpering. We had a long walk, and I had my breakfast when we got back. I was hoping to do a bit of sewing but Henry had other ideas, he loves his blue rubber ball and keeps bringing it back to throw again. There was no settling him, so we went another walk at 11am. My left shoulder feels like my arm has been pulled out of it's socket, hanging onto a big strong dog certainly tires you out. We went down a farm track where I could let him lose, and thankfully there were no other dog walkers about. He just loves water, and of course he managed to find a ditch with a foot of lovely muddy water in the bottom. He thought a good rub down with a towel when we got back was such good fun. At last he flaked out on the floor, and I managed to get back to my sewing."}, {"title": "Going to collect Henry", "date": "Saturday 7 November 2009", "text": "Just a quickie, I'm off to collect Henry for his weekend away, hope he's packed his overnight bag, ha ha. I've tidied the house, and picked everything up off the floor that he might consider to be a tasty morsel ! The cats food dishes are upstairs in the bedroom, this is the routine we have when we have a house guest. They will have a surprise as Henry comes bounding in, and I don't expect to see much of them over the next 24 hours, poor little loves. I feel a bit mean doing this to them, but if Henry can gain a little bit of knowledge about cats, he will turn into a more sociable dog.  If it goes wrong I can always take him back to his house and stay there with him.

This is my idea for recycling ornaments that are past their best. This cat wasn't particularly old but it had a strange face with puffy cheeks, and some of the paint had come off. The shape was ideal, gently rounded, no bits sticking out.Remember the beads and stone that I covered in crochet, why not try it with something bigger. It helps if the ornament is not too complicated though, it would be almost impossible to do a horse unless it's legs were tucked underneath it. This is puss approaching the halfway stage.I started at the bottom, crochet a circle then add a few more stitches for the feet. Then go round and round, increasing and decreasing to fit the contours, no pattern just follow the curves. I drew a picture of it before I started, marking where the stitching should go. I thought a red cat would be nice. Four buttons for the eyes, and black wool for the markings. And hey diddly, introducing Oscar, isn't he cute? He is almost 10 inches tall, the photo doesn't do him justice as the flash has whiped out the detail in the stitches.

This is me and HenryI have got him for the weekend while they go away. Henry is 10 months old and a big boy, he is so strong. I looked after him in June and it was a nightmare, he ate everything he could find. I am hoping he is going to behave himself in my house, I don't know what the cats will think, they will probably do a runner. If things don't work out I can always take him back to his house and stay there. This is going to be a trial, because I am looking after him again in a couple of weeks time, and it will be for six days. I think it would be good to take him out to places he hasn't been to before, treat it like a holiday for both of us.

Much too stressful to sit around waiting for it.I took some books back to the library, and took the bag I made to the Scrapstore. They were very pleased with it, and I came away with another sample in several shades of blue, to make another one.My poor little baby is spending a lonely night locked inside the Central Tyres garage, awaiting some new front discs and pads, which will be fitted tomorrow morning, then I will get the pass certificate. The lads at the garage look after me, I have been going there for years, they very kindly gave me a lift home.On a lighter note, I did find a one pound coin plus a 5p and a 2p coin lying on the ground in the car park at Wickes, not that it will make much of a dent in the \u00a3294 I have got to pay out for my MOT.

I had visions of her standing on top of me, using all her body weight to pull with both hands. I gripped the arms of the chair and pushed myself downwards so that my head wouldn't lift up as she pulled, I braced myself for the struggle. A couple of seconds later, as quick as a blink, she had my molar between the pliers in her hand.

They used to have The Times, a newspaper that I quite like but stopped buying years ago. On the low tables there were notices saying because of the spread of germs, and the swine flu epidemic, they no longer have papers and magazines. They might as well take the tables away then. I sat and twiddled my thumbs. Does this mean that all the public libraries are going to close, due to the risk of catching some dreaded lurgi?Anyway, I came away with a smile on my face today, a clean bill of health and an appointment for nine months time.

I went to the Scrapstore yesterday and they have been given a lot of fabric samples from a furniture company, lovely patterns and colours. They're not the usual single piece of fabric, but have been made up into flat cushions with a piece of wadding between non matching front and back. They are about a foot square, and no one has come up with a good idea for them yet. It was obvious to me......bags of course. One of the seams is machine stitched on the outside, so I unpicked it. Then I cut a two inch strip off the top, I separated the two pieces and cut the two inch wadding strip lengthways in half again. Now I have two handles, roll them into two sausages with the wadding in the centre and sew them down the length.Next find a piece of pink fabric to match, for the lining, sew the sides together. The wadding in the bag has been removed, it can be used for something else. Then get a small piece of pink, make a small narrow sausage, in a similar way to the handles but a lot smaller. And finally you need a button, sew it into place putting a small piece of folded fabric on the inside to reinforce it. Pin everything into place, the lining inside, sandwiching the handles and the button tie, between the outer and inner. Sew one neat seam around the top, I used the machine but you could hand sew it. Finished in a couple of hours, and almost free. I'm going to take this to the Scrapstore next week so they can put it on display, in the hope that other people will be inspired to make one.

I bought 16 wooden beads for 20p from the car boot sale last week, they are the ideal size, 2cm in diameter. There is a pattern in the book, but I don't understand crochet patterns, they are like a foreign language to me, so I made it up as I went along. The end result was just as good as the book.

I had a stone (6cm's across) in my drawer which I picked up off the beach when I visited Spurn Point a few months back, so I started in the same way, round and round. Finally got it covered, what do I do with it now? It needs some decoration, so I found a few pearl beads and stitched them on. Hey presto.....a paper weight.I am going to cover more of the beads in different colours and string them together to make a necklace. This has set me thinking about covering all sorts of objects with crochet, because you can increase and decrease the stitches to fit, not like knitting, where you have to start with the right amount. When I get really profficient in it I might attempt to cover a damaged ornament of a sitting cat, I could stitch the markings on afterwards.

You may recall I live in a village next to the River Trent, I often walk on the embankment, and I wondered what the view was like from the other side, so I got on my bike and went to have a look. First I went along the track at the bottom of the wood to Flixborough, the tyres are still there in the ditch, then I went to Gunness and onto the A18 to cross the river over the Keadby Bridge. This was originally named the King George V bridge which was opened on 21st May 1916. It was a lifting bridge but was fixed in 1955, so it no longer opens. They used to pump water into the massive ballast box which rolled the huge wheels over the track, lifting up the other end so boats could pass through. Close up of the ballast boxThe big wheels underneath the box.I stoppped at Keadby and took this photo of the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, where it joins the Trent. Keadby Power Station is in the background. On I pedalled through Amcotts to Garthorpe, and looked across the water to the church on the hill, that's where I live, so near yet so far away. I wish there was a bridge here so I could just nip back home, my bum is beginning to get a bit saddle sore. I sat on a stone and had my lunch.I wanted to go a bit further to Blacktoft Nature Reserve, but time was getting on and I didn't have any lights on my bike, and I didn't think my bot could stand much more pedalling.I was right to come back at that point, my left knee hurts when I bend it, my left hip aches, and I have a shooting pain from my knee up the front of my leg.

It's a thingybobwotsit for keeping earrings tidy, so you don't have to search through a box for the right pair everytime you go out. A small plastic coathanger with a piece of thin foam stapled onto it, just poke the earrings through . A simple invention which does the job, though rather unsightly. Surely I can come up with a better idea. First a small coathanger, cut two pieces if thin foam, one to fit the triangle at the top, and one to hang below the bar. Tack them into place. Then cut two pieces of fabric this shape. Preferably plain not patterened, and loosely woven so that the pointy bit of the earring will easily pierce it and not leave a mark. Test it first before cutting the fabric out, I used dark blue velvet. At this stage you need to choose something to decorate the top bit, it's easier if you sew this on now. You can use some contrasting fabric, or ribbon, or buttons or beads, let your imagination run riot. I cut a flower pattern from a piece of cotton fabric, sealed the edges with clear nail varnish, and hand stitched it on with invisible thread. You could embroider your own design by hand or machine. Or you could personalise it with a name if you are giving it as a gift.Then you sew the two pieces together inside out. Sew the sides and the top bit but leave a small hole for the hook of the hanger to go through. Turn it the right way and put the hanger and foam inside it, then neatly hand stitch the bottom together. Because I have used velvet you can't see the stitches. Finito.

Under the cover of darkness, sneak out with a carrier bag and grab a handfull of newspapers.  Magazines are even better, as this would be more money saved.Wearing a balaclava is advisable, the embarrassment if you are spotted, you don't want people pointing at you in the street. You must do everything to protect your identity, and going out very late when everyone is in bed gives you less chance of being rumbled.Of course you should be very selective about which neighbours you choose to 'borrow' your reading matter from. Bypass the houses where they read the red tops if your taste is for something a little more cultural, and look out for people who might have the same hobbies as you. Twelve copies of Gardners World could save you a tidy sum.Please don't misunderstand me, I am not telling you to go out and steal, think of it as a library, you are just borrowing. You can always return them the following week or two weeks, in exchange for a fresh supply.

I got the bus to Hull Bus station, it's massive, lots of choices to venture further afield, so I got on a bus to Beverley. Luckily it was a double decker and I had the best seat for the best views, upstairs at the front. I love being nosey and peering in people's gardens.Many years ago I used to go out with a chap at Beverley, it's a lovely market town with lots of small shops with their own unique character. I noticed there were a lot of charity shops which I ambled in an out of, and as Beverley is a very affluent town the quality of stock was much higher than normal. I found a pair of roller blades, I have been looking for some for ages, and these were only six pounds. Sadly they were a size 4, not big enough, I was disappointed. Never mind I will keep looking, I really fancy having a go at it, I used to be quite good at ice skating. Here is a photo of St Mary's church, it's very close to the bustling town centre, yet when you are inside it you can't hear anything of the noisy traffic passing a few feet away. Beverley also has a Minster, it's huge, so quite difficult to get the whole place in one photo. There used to be a monastery on the site, and work started on the present church in 1220 and it was finished in 1425. The official website is http://www.beverleyminster.org/ if you want to know more. When you look up and see all the ornate stonework, you wonder how they ever managed to build something of such a great size and with so much beauty. These buildings never cease to amaze me. Imagine if they attempted to build something similar now, they would have all the modern mechanical means available to do it, so how did they put this up all those years ago? Absolutely amazing.On the way back I had a look round Hull for an hour and took this photo. Radio 5 Live were doing a promotion in a big dome. I cropped this photo so that it looks like a spaceship from another planet has landed :-) The kids were having fun inside pretending to be radio presenters, their images were shown on the big screen outside in the square.A good day out for free, oh I nearly forgot, I treated myself to a Thorntons Cappuccino chocolate bar for 69p, naughty but nice."}, {"title": "Splashing out a bit today", "date": "Thursday 22 October 2009", "text": "I wasn't going to spend any money today when I went to town, just pay a couple of bills into the bank, and pay my council tax, BUT......I spotted the 'SALE' sign in the window at Millets the outdoor and camping shop. I have been toying with the idea for a while of getting some new walking boots, but the prices seem astronomically high, \u00a3130 is a bit over my budget. Besides I have been managing ok with my charity shop and car boot sale boots, at \u00a32 and \u00a34 a pair you can't get much cheaper than that.However, I am planning on doing longer walks in the future, and possibly doing the coast to coast long distance path of 190 miles. I have also heard about a 24 hour walk over 64 miles next year, which I wouldn't mind having a go at. So I meandered into the shop, just to see what the sale prices were like. I tried a few pairs on and was pleasantly surprised at how lightweight they are, and how snugly they fit. I am not too keen on the fabric type uppers, preferring the brown leather style, even though the assistant said they are both waterproof. I opted for a pair of Karrimor boots which had 50% off in the sale, so at \u00a355 I thought that was ok. I am not looking forward to breaking them in, and will probably have to do a few short walks in the beginning. The shop girl said I could wear them in the house for 24 hours and if they weren't right I could take them back. I might do that. I was on my way to the Scrapstore when I noticed that the Oxfam shop had closing down notices in the window, all clothing is three items for \u00a31. Not one to miss an opportunity I was in there like a shot. I found these six items. Top left, a light brown suede type jacket, fits me perfect. Next a blue fleecey top, ideal for winter. The flowery fabric is an old fashioned ladies long sleeved dress, I think they call it vintage now. The fabric is gorgeous and soft, I will probably cut this up for my crafts. Next to it is a skirt I bought for the colour, also for cutting up. And there is a pair of dark purple trousers which I can wear. The peach coloured jacket is another gorgeous soft fabric, also for cutting up, although if I am daring enough I might wear it, a real classy style jacket. Also not in the photo, I bought a set of floral curtains for 50p. Quite a few bargains there, all for \u00a32.50, I am well pleased.

At ten months old he looks like a fully grown labrador, he came bounding out to greet me when I opened the door, his tail wagging excitedly.It was a little bit drizzley so we went a walk before the rain got too heavy. He has been going to dog training classes for a while, so I was hoping for an easy walk. No, he seems to have forgotten most of what he has learnt, the first thing he did when we got out the gate was to drag me across the road.I talk to Helen constantly and she updates me on his progress. I have been to dog classes with her so that I can learn how he should be trained, to make sure we are both following the same commands and he doesn't get confused. Boy is it hard work, but it has to be done if you want your dog to be well behaved.We had a long walk across the fields, labradors love water so he was in and out of the dyke several times, it was great to see him enjoying himself. On the way back I constantly had to stop and start, to keep his pulling in check, treats come in handy as a reward for good behaviour.Helen had very kindly left me some home made soup for my lunch, it was delicious. She had been having a clear out of her wardrobe and left me a pile of clothes to look through before she takes them to the charity shop.

I know, I know, that's disgusting, I am a slob, but I do have an excuse. My dear cat Lily who sleeps on the bed with me, insists on trying to burrow underneath the bedclothes. I have to give in because my face would be torn to shreds by his paw as he whacks me with it every few seconds to remind me he is still there. Then he wriggles and squirms untill he finds a comfortable position, I on the other hand have to lie there not moving a muscle in case I squash him. Eventually we both drop off to sleep. Not for long though, he stands up and jumps down and proceeds to start scratching around on the carpet. I am sure that because it's green he thinks it is grass. I know this is a warning signal for thinks to happen, so I shine the torch in his direction. A torch comes in very handy during the night, it's wind up of course, saves getting out of bed to put the light on, and I don't like being blinded suddenly by a bright light when I am half asleep. I waited a minute, the scratching continued, then it went quiet. No, it wasn't alright to go back to sleep at this point, just a few more minutes and I would know what to do next. Then it hit me, the vomit inducing smell coming from the direction of the litter box, this cat has forgotten that he is supposed to bury it. Not an ideal situation I know, to have a litter box in the bedroom, but when you have an old boy who has a few senior moments, it's better than scraping it up off the carpet. I shot out of bed in a flash, and holding my breath I dashed down the stairs with the box, putting all the lights on ahead of me. A quick turn of the door key and I was out on the back yard dumping the box on the ground. Thank you Lily, can we go back to sleep now, I think we will lie in a bit longer in the morning. I've been wondering what to do with some old felt tipped colouring pens, they were too pretty to throw out. I took all the insides out and trimmed the ends and finished up with mulitcoloured plastic tubes. They have been lying around on my dining room table for ages. I had the idea to make a bracelet with them, but the main body of the pens are made with brittle plastic which doesn't cut too well as it splinters and cracks. The tops however are made out of a more flexible plastic, and trim up nicely with a sharp craft knife. Here is my bracelet.The pieces are half an inch long, I made two holes in each piece with a hot nail, heated over the gas cooker. The holes are not exactly opposite each other because the bracelet has to curve round the wrist, and I didn't want the elastic that is threaded through them to show. Measure the right amount of pieces to fit snugly round the wrist with no gaps. You need to trim the excess plastic from around the holes with a small craft knife. Then tie a knot in the elastic in the centre of one of the pieces so it is hidden. Simple but it looks dead cool."}, {"title": "Handy little containers.", "date": "Monday 19 October 2009", "text": "Here is an idea you might like to copy.

As I very rarely go there I do not want to have them lying around for that long. Once washed they can become handy little containers for small items. I cut these down to three inches tall, and as you can see, twelve of them fit nicely inside the lid of a box. You could make them any height you like, and if you have a bigger box you could put more of them in, maybe 15 or 2o or more. If you had a hobby that you needed to store lots of small parts you could cut them to fit inside a drawer. I'm not sure what to put in these yet, I was thinking of sorting out my nails and screws as they are all mixed up in a big tin, it takes me ages to find the ones I want.

Today I walked to town and back, it's about 4.5 miles each way. I can use footpaths across the fields for part of it, but have to put up with cars whizzing by along the road, for the rest.I had a browse round the charity shops but nothing took my fancy. I am always on the look out for some sturdy outdoor walking shoes, as I like to have a choice of what to wear, according to the conditions I am tramping through.I picked up some pumpkin seeds and flax seeds from the health food shop, then went to the library. Had a read of the newspapers, half an hour on the computer, and borrowed a couple of books.On the way home across the fields, I met a woman coming the other way and stopped to have a chat. It was a coincidence that she was doing virtually the same walk as me, only the opposite way round. Funny how these things happen. We agreed we were both walking because we love the outdoors. I could have easily got the bus but I really enjoy the physical excercise, knowing that each step is doing me good.When I got home I made a big pan of veggie stew, there's enough for three days, so I wont have to bother cooking untill Tuesday."}, {"title": "A lot to remember !", "date": "Friday 16 October 2009", "text": "I thought I was going to get my hot water fixed today, two young men arrived this morning, they said they had come to change the gas pipe from the meter to the boiler, which was the wrong diameter.

Half an hour later they said they had forgotten to bring a gas bottle for the blowtorch, and they had to go back to the depot to get one. They both went off in the van.Forty minutes later they came back. Have I got a key to open the gas meter box? They had forgotten theirs. Have I got a cloth to wipe up with?

After crawling along narrow lanes worried about meeting something coming the opposite way, and having to shunt around a particularly tight right hand turn, there was the entrance. A narrow rough track, should I drive into it, or park and have a look first, remembering my days of driving a lorry into a yard and finding myself unable to get back out again. I took a chance and inched my way between two massive stone pillars that were once gate posts, relief as it opened out into a small car park. No sign of anyone as this hostel is run by volunteers and the opening time is 5pm. I grabbed a bite to eat from my pack up, and put my boots on. Armed with my map I headed off towards a tall monument on the top of a hill, which looked not too far away. This area is riddled with footpaths, the Pennine Way, the Pennine Bridleway, and the Calderdale way, and hundreds of others. The climb became very steep and I had to have a breather a couple of times. As I sat on a rock a little boy appeared from nowhere, and started chattering merrily away to me. I was just about to ask who he was with, when the rest of the family turned up. Grandma and Grandad, Mum with a little girl, and Dad carrying a small boy. It was nice to see the whole family enjoying themselves. When I reached the top the views were wonderful, well worth the effort.  This is Stoodley Pike, it stands at 121 feet tall and was first built in 1814, it collapsed in 1854 after a lightening strike and was rebuilt.This is what I am looking at, heaven.....From here I went down the other side, a very difficult walk over boggy ground with no obvious signs of a footpath. It was a matter of looking into the distance and heading for what looked like a stile or a marker post. I reached Withens Clough Reservoir and skirted round the edge of it before returning to the Hostel. The next day I was up bright and early to get the bus to Todmorden and the train to Manchester. I must say the Northern Rail service was excellent, a clean train, running every half hour, and a reasonably priced day return ticket. I had a bit of time to kill in Manchester so I had a ride on the huge Observation Wheel. It's a bit like a smaller version of the London Eye, only it went a bit faster, a good panoramic view of the city. The pods had smoked glass so I was afraid the photo's wouldn't come out very well.   Pity the Cathedral is undergoing renovation and is half covered with plastic sheeting.I also had time to have a peek inside the Town Hall, a stunning building.View of the clock tower taken from inside the building.Now it was time to head off for Granada Television Studios, and join the throng waiting to sit in on the recording of a new game show called Heads or Tails, hosted by Justin Lee Collins. There were about a dozen people in front of me, I did wonder at one stage what on earth I was doing there, for a start I hate waiting for anything, especially in a queue. I took a photo of the rather sad and neglected looking gateway which might have been the main entrance at one time. Now it is rather shabby and blocked off. At 1.30pm a young lady came out and checked our names and issued us with wrist bands. We were escorted in and went through the usual security checks, handbag search and metal detector. We were then herded into a room next to the Rovers Return, a replica of the famous pub, not where they do the filming, then we were led into the studios, passing the Countdown clock in the props department. I got a seat on the second row, and once we were all sitting the warm up people came out and whipped us all up into a frenzy! No not quite that bad, we were given instructions when to clap, cheer, shout, and jump up and down with glee. They recorded all this activity at the start, and then they add it all in afterwards. Justin Lee Collins appeared next and everyone applauded. I couldn't stop giggling, I thought he was a big chunky guy, what a surprise to see a not very tall, rather weedy frame dressed in a baggy suit. The show got underway, the contestant was a young lady called China, who works in a circus. I couldn't understand how the game worked, other than you could win one million pounds if you correctly guessed heads ot tails all the way through. Maths has never been my strong subject. It dragged on and on and on. Stopping and starting, surprise guests, lots of banter, I could have happily left halfway through it. Eventually the end was in sight, building up to the grand nail biting finish, would she gamble the \u00a310,000 that she had won, and try for the million. She asked us what should she do, we all shouted. It makes for good television if someone goes for the make or break death. We waited for her answer, 'I will take the ten grand thankyou very much.' A huge sigh from me, and a sort of half hearted cheer from the audience, yay, we can all go home now. Bye the way it will be on Channel Five, not sure when. Back at the hostel I found I was not the only one staying the night, a man turned up who actually works for the YHA, he had come to do a health and safety inspection. We got chatting he was an experienced walker and very knowledgeable about maps, he gave me a quick map reading lesson. He also had two lurcher dogs in his van, which he had trained for mountain rescue, they were lovely animals. It was nice to have a bit of company. The next day I was up early again, eager to get a full days walking in before returning home. I picked my route and set off once more into the hills. It was very misty, and at one point it appeared to be getting heavier instead of lifting. I marched on through the swirling fog. Eventually visibility began to improve. I came down from the hills to walk along the Rochdale Canal for a while.I shared my cheese sandwich with two black cats who lived next to the canal, and on the last leg of my walk I stopped to chat to a man who was repairing a drystone wall. You meet some interesting people when you holiday alone. I arrived back at the hostel at 5pm and said my goodbye's to the wardens, you never know I might bump into them somewhere else one day."}, {"title": "I feel a mini break coming on", "date": "Sunday 11 October 2009", "text": "Can you manage without me for a few days, I'm off tramping the hills of West Yorkshire.

I shall also be going to Granada Television Studios for the recording of a game show hosted by Justin Lee Collins, I mentioned it last weeek. I'll tell you all about it when I get back. Toodle Pip.I thought it was too good to be true, two days of gas contractors working in my house, and I have a fully functional central heating system....ermmm, not exactly. True, it was working and I had two wonderful baths out of it, but things seem to have come to a halt, the water has stopped flowing. Now it's just a dribble, .I am now reluctant to switch it on because I suspect the tank maybe empty. It's not easy to tell with all that cladding on it, but it sounds like an empty tin when I give it a slap. So best err on the side of caution and leave it alone till someone comes to look at it.Last week Warm Front sent an inspector to check out the work. Sharp intake of breath and a tut tut was heard from the vicinity of the airing cupboard. He called me over, 'See that meter there, they've put it on upside down, they will have to come back and put it right.'Then he asked where the gas meter was, I directed him to the box outside, on the front of the house. Another sharp intake of breath. 'They've used the wrong diameter of copper pipe from the meter to the boiler, it should be bigger than that due to the distance between them. I'm afraid they will have to come back and change it.' So now I have to wait for Bodgitt and Slapdash to return with their bag of tools. I suppose another few weeks won't make any difference, I've been without central heating for two years, I am well used to it."}, {"title": "Saving up for a new car", "date": "Friday 9 October 2009", "text": "Do people accidentally drop money in the streets, have they got holes in their pockets, or do they deliberately throw it away?

If I can do that more often then I'm laughing, it all helps to balance the books.I was listening to Ellen McArthur yesterday morning on Desert Island Discs, Radio 4. She told of the time when she was at school and wanted to buy a dinghy, and needed about \u00a3500. The clever girl worked out that if she only had potatoes and gravy for her school dinners, then she could pocket the rest of the money. All the pennies she saved were recorded on a chart, when she got to 100 she put it into a savings account. She reached the magical figure and got her boat. Now that's what I call enterprising.

I'll take it again tomorrow, good job it's only two miles away. Look what I found under my stairs..... A lovely big puffy cushion I made about 25 years ago. I thought I had thrown it out, I'm rather pleased I didn't. It measures 24 inches across, and I can remember painstakingly hand stitching every piece. The cover has a zip opening, and I made the cushion inside out of an old nylon bed sheet, remember those awful things! I cut the 61 hexagons from a couple of my dresses, again a crimplene/nylon type fabric that never creased and never needed ironing. The back is just one piece of plain dark blue.

It's three walks a day, so I'm not able to venture very far.Yesterday I very bravely entered my spare room, I have been putting off this moment for a couple of months, knowing what I would find on the other side of the door. Anything that doesn't have a designated place in the house, and isn't used very often, gets shoved in there. It's just got to be done, I thought, as I cautiously peered inside. A big sort out is needed.I like to do this chore every couple of months or so, but you know what it's like, keep the door shut and forget about it, and a year later the clutter is horrendous. Pussycat Bugsy came in with me, hopeing for a game of hide and seek, he soon did a runner when I hauled a lot of the stuff out onto the landing and plugged the Dyson in.The secret to sorting stuff out, or decluttering as I like to call it, is that you don't put it all back again, like my friend Rosie. Her house is a nightmare, it is packed to the rafters with stuff, and she keeps buying more. As a consequence her life is rather chaotic like her house. I couldn't be doing with having to search through mountains of stuff everytime you want something, I'm sure it was here somewhere, ;-0Anyway today I feel a whole lot better, like a burden has been lifted off my shoulders. I have some stuff to take to the council dump. Why do I need to keep an electric blanket that could potentially burn my house down, or a padded headboard that hasn't been used for twenty years and probably never will again? I've got a couple of boxes of stuff for the charity shop. I don't need a magazine rack , I keep my copies of Psychologies on the dining room table to browse while I eat, and I don't need a waste bin in the bathroom, I take my rubbish downstairs and put it straight in the kitchen bin.I have just been in my tidy spare room, there are still a few items I can give away.

I picked out some matching fabric samples from the pile I have been hoarding for many years, and cut them into three inch squares. I stitched these together with the machine to make two sides. I added a strip across the top of each one because I thought this would make it easier to sew the zip onto, I also added two strips on the inside cut from an old plastic tablecloth to act as a stiffener. Next I made the handles with matching fabric, and stitched one onto each side. Then came the decoration, always best to sew it on now before you join them up. I cut three leaf shapes from some red upholstery fabric, and sealed the edges with clear nail varnish, then hand stitched them into place with a few buttons. I rounded the bottom corners and sewed the two sides together. Next I sewed the zip into place, this came from a garment that I took apart. Finally I made the lining from a gold shiny blouse that I bought for 20p from a car boot sale. I hand sewed this into the bag neatly round the top. Everything fitted together perfectly, the right colour lining, right colour cotton, and a zip the right size. It is 12\" x 11\" and the handles are long enough to put them over your shoulder. I'm very pleased with it."}, {"title": "Extreme money saving tips", "date": "Sunday 4 October 2009", "text": "You may have read my money saving tips on the side --> I thought I would explain the logic in my thinking, in case you are wondering whether I have totally lost the plot. I know some of them are a bit bizarre, but believe me, they work.My background is that I was brought up in a family with no money to spare, my mother was brilliant at making ends meet, and so I watched and learnt from her. In fact I probably go further than her when it comes to saving money in the kitchen. You have to keep in mind that I live by myself, so it is a lot easier to adopt a frugal lifestyle. Some of the things I do may not be readily accepted by other members of the family.For instance, cooking a three day stew in a big pan and eating it out of the same pan. I cannot see the point of putting a portion onto a plate, eating it, then you have to wash the plate. It costs money to wash dishes, so don't dirty them. When I make a meal I use the minimum amount of pots and pans, so I don't have to pay for the water, then heat it, and buy lots of washup liquid.Who says you have to wash the dishes after every meal anyway? It's not set in stone, it's just a habit. Why not put them on the side of the worktop for a few days, and when you need a pan or a plate, take one off the pile. When the pile gets too big or they get too dirty, then wash them. I have been known to lick my plate clean after a particularly delicious meal, shock horror. I don't want to waste any of it. Not very ladylike you may say, but there is no one here to see me, and the plate can be used again. Seems logical to me.My meals are simple. I use very little oil, I hardly ever make sauces, and never fry anything. For example, you fry an egg, frying is bad for you, it spits oil all over the cooker, time, effort, and money to clean it. Why not boil it in a pan used just for this purpose, you don't need to wash the pan.I never use the oven, it uses too much gas, and it takes too long to cook anything, and I hate cleaning ovens. Those who want roast meat should seriously think about becoming vegetarian, it's a healthy lifestyle and a lot cheaper. You wont die if you stop eating meat. Which brings me onto the next point, bulk up your food with oatbran, it's wonderful stuff. Put it into everything.I never follow recipes, it's cheaper to make it up as you go. How many times have you bought ingredients for a special dish only to use half of them, and the other half sits in the cupboard for the next five years! When concocting a meal throw in anything you happen to have in your store cupboard. Only buy items for your cupboard that you know you will use within three months.When you shop for food don't take a list unless you have a terrible memory. Buy your food on price, good value for money, and nutrition. Don't be a picky eater, buying what you fancy costs a lot more. I don't care what I eat as long as it is not meat, and it is good for me. Food is the fuel I need to keep my body in good condition. I miss out whole aisles at the supermarket, dont do cakes, biscuits, soft drinks, crisps, ready meals, confectionary, sugary spreads, ice cream, and puddings. I might spend some time studying prices and reading labels, but it makes shopping a lot easier if you limit the range of food you buy.And the last money saving tip is, never ever throw food away. Eat everything you buy."}, {"title": "My winter tonic", "date": "Saturday 3 October 2009", "text": "I noticed a bush heavily laden with elderberries last week and after passing it several times whilst dog walking, I finally remembered to take a carrier bag and a pair of scissors with me.After stripping the berries from the stalks, I boiled them up in two big pans, adding a small amount of sugar and a few drops of lemon juice. When cooled I put the mushed berries through a sieve. The sesame seed oil bottles I had been saving came very in handy for bottling the juice, and the excess was frozen in ice cube trays. I shall be adding it to other drinks, as I find the taste a little strange. The main reason for me making this is because it is good for me, so as long as it is palatable that's fine.

When I saw them on Wednesday they said they would be launching further along the river bank today, just down the hill in Burton upon Stather. I didn't know what time but I took a chance and went to have a look for them. Sure enough the orange blob was highly visible from a distance.They were almost ready to launch, and in place of the young lady from Hull University, the passenger this time was a man who was going out to measure the contours of the waters edge. The pilot cut the engine for a few minutes to chat to me, and I cheekily asked if I could have a ride, not expecting a yes, but if you don't ask.......He said the regulations don't allow for passengers that are not part of the official business, all kinds of permits have to be applied for before any craft can go on the river. I discovered that the pilot is also the owner of the hovercraft, Dr James Thurlow, he gave me his card. The company is called intertidal, here is the website if you want to learn more.http://www.intertidal.net/ I would love to be able to go on one of these, and even learn how to pilot one, but I feel my age is against me, I have missed the boat :-( I remember how excited I was when I learnt to drive a lorry, got my first job, and several years later worked for Leicester Heavy Haulage transporting abnormal loads, the buzz was fantastic. My work often involved massive cranes, something else I would have loved to learn. But there was three things against me, my age, I should have started lorry driving earlier, the fact that I was born female, not a problem for me but it was for other people, and the cost of the training. Never mind, I'm going to put my cosmic order in for another life, there's a lot more to do, and I'm going to need another go at it :-)  And then they were gone........."}, {"title": "A walk with a bonus", "date": "Wednesday 30 September 2009", "text": "It was a bright sunny morning, this morning, so as soon as I had my breakfast I was out the door for a walk. The footpath behind our church leads onto what we call the Hills, a series of mini ups and downs along a wide grassy area. It runs high above the River Trent as it joins the River Ouse. I have walked this path many times before, but each time I get a thrill as I marvel at the spectacular views, I never tire of it. It takes one hour to walk to Alkborough, and this is what you find when you arrive. Julians Bower, a maze cut into the turf. This was first recorded in 1697, it stands high up on a plateau. In 2007 it was closed for three months for restoration. I walked down the steep hill to the Alkborough Flats. It has been developed as part of the Environment Agency\u2019s flood risk management strategy. In September 2006 a 20m wide breach was cut into the flood defence bank allowing up to170ha to flood during the highest tides of the year. The site is designed to act as a flood storage area in times of extreme weather, primarily during tidal surges which will reduce impacts of flooding along the Trent, Ouse and Humber.Just as I reached the bottom of the hill I saw a hovercraft about to leave, there was no time to take a photograph, with a loud roar of the engine it was gone. I wondered how long it would be away for, so I had a walk round and waited for it to come back. About two hours later it appeared and guess what, I was in the wrong place to get a good photo :-( This is the best I could do.I had a chat with the two people that had been using it. The young lady was working for Hull University and they had hired the craft from a company a few miles up the river in Barrow on Humber. The reason why they were away so long was because she has to take hundreds of samples from the mud, so there is a lot of stopping and starting. After their lunch break they were going to go out again, but I didn't wait around, it was getting a bit chilly. I took a few photo's of the flora and fauna. On the way back I stopped to chat to a couple who were sitting on the bench at the maze. They were on holiday at the caravan site, so I was able to suggest places for them to visit. Then half way back I came across five men who were sitting on their fold up chairs, flying their radio controlled model aircraft over the edge of the steep bank. They were very friendly answering all my questions, no one would let me have a go though. Boys and their toys, ha ha. What an interesting walk, you never know what you are going to find, it was a bonus to see the hovercraft. I was out for six hours, completely missed lunch."}, {"title": "Free coffee and biscuits", "date": "Tuesday 29 September 2009", "text": "I got my free coffee and biscuits yesterday at Blood Donors, I reckon it was a fair exchange. They decided they could take some this time as my iron level was high enough, maybe that was because I had some broccoli for my dinner the night before. Normally I don't feel any different after they have removed nearly an armful, but last night I felt so tired.This morning I had to sit and rest because I was still tired, so I read a book for an hour in the arm chair, then fell asleep. This is very unlike me as I usually have bags of energy. I am wondering if I should carry on donating blood, but my next appointment is not untill March so I have plenty of time to think about it. I might ring them up and ask about it.This afternoon two men came to wire in the electrics to my new boiler. The timer box is in the airing cupboard above the hot water tank, and the thermostat is on the wall in the hallway. The young man explained how it all works, but I am still going to have to study the instruction booklet, it seems very complicated.

First of all I cut six pieces of red plastic from an M & S carrier bag, this is going to be used for the letters. Sandwich them between two sheets of baking paper, you can use greaseproof paper, it doesn't matter if they are a bit creased. Then iron them with a medium to hot iron. I use a piece of hardboard to protect the table. It is best to be in a well ventilated room while you do this, open the window and door.  Use circular motions with the iron, turn it over and iron both sides. Check to see that all layers have stuck together, and peel the paper off while it is still hot.  It will go a bit wrinkly but that doesn't matter. Then I traced the letters I wanted from an embroidery magazine, onto the baking paper, and transferred them onto the plastic with a pencil and cut them out. Next cut eight pieces of plain plastic, I used a charity bag, slightly bigger than the panel size I wanted. Arrange your bits of decoration and cover the whole thing with a piece of clear plastic.Don't forget the paper top and bottom before you iron, you will end up with a piece like this, after you have trimmed the edges.Save all your plastic bags, they come in usefull for cutting the pieces for your design, you can really go to town and personalise it. The more colours you have the better. You can also make up several of these panels and sew them together, it gives you a very strong piece which you can make into a bag."}, {"title": "Keeping in touch with the past", "date": "Sunday 27 September 2009", "text": "I got back lateish last night from the wedding in Nuneaton on Friday, managed to make it into a two day jolly. The bride and groom, Adam and Gemma, looked lovely, here is a photo I took outside in the park. It is not as sharp as it should be as there was a bit of a jostle for places, and they were both having fun so it was difficult to snap them at the exact moment for a perfect picture. After the service we all walked to Adam's favourite hostelry, The Jail House, for a meal and entertainment, then we went on to the Conservative Club where more guests arrived for the evening disco. At this point I was very pleased that I had dressed sensibly, in black trousers, soft little boots, flowery top, and a jacket, all from charity shops except the trousers which I have had for years. The walk to the club was a bit chilly for some, but I was ok. A lot of the ladies were tottering around in high heels and suffering the consequences of sore feet. My feet were lovely however, as I threw myself around the dance floor to Sweet Soul Music, the moment that starts I just have to get up. I gave up dressing for fashion years ago, now I dress for me, and my style is comfortable. After an overnight stay at my sister's house in Burton upon Trent, she wasn't there and her bed is lovely and comfortable, I had a look round the town. This is where I grew up so I was keen to see some of the changes, some of them good some not so good. The traffic seems to have increased tenfold, there are two bridges to cross the River Trent so I decided to cross it early because later it was going to become almost gridlocked. I parked a short distance away and walked into town. I had to have a stroll over the long foot bridge which goes from the back of the market place, over the washlands to Stapenhill Gardens on the other side of the river. This area flooded regularly when the river burst it's banks. It used to be just wild rough ground, now it has footpaths criss crossing it has been turned into a lovely country park. This is the sign in the ironwork half way along the bridge. This is the point where the bridge crosses the river. I had a loaf of bread which I fed to the swans and geese, it took all of three seconds for it to be demolished, then I made a hasty retreat as the word got around that there was food, and another fifty thousand birds appeared. Maybe I should have bought a pallet load for them, ha ha. I remember playing in the Stapenhill Gardens when I was a child, mum would bring us on the bus, we loved it there. The flower beds had little footpaths and steps between them which we merrily ran up and down. It's nice to see that the council are keeping things tidy, although there are no flowers at present it still brings back memories. The big white swan is still there, this is also filled with flowers in the spring. As a focal point in the centre of the gardens it must have been photographed millions of times.A lot of the town is pedestrianised now, with modern shopping malls. I used to spend my Saturdays around the market when I was a teenager, spending my small wages on clothes, makeup, and magazines. The outdoor market has been downsized now, due to the economic climate, but the indoor market is still vibrant. It was a pleasure to walk round, light and airy, and clean and tidy. I even recognised some of the stall names, though I'm not sure that the original people are still running them. The old Woolies in the High Street where I worked in 1965 is now a Wetherspoons pub, my old optition is still there, Lancaster and Thorpe, and the leather shop where I worked for all of five days, Start and Tremayne, is still there. Of course over the years all the new names have moved into the town, the people in the area are well served now and don't need to go to nearby Derby like they used to. The rest of the day was taken up with visiting my uncle Stan, he is a lively gentleman of 86 years young, his wife Pat cooked us up a lovely lunch. From there I visited my lady lorry driving friend, Paddy and her husband Joe, at Melbourne just outside Derby. It was good to see her, and talk about the old days of trucking. Paddy was 73 last week and she is still driving her 44 tonner. As she was late starting her driving career, 50 something, she still has diesel in her veins, although she admitted that the job has changed and it isn't as good as it used to be. I tried to persuade her to retire, and go off touring in their motorhome, one day she might just do that. I have found an interview that Paddy did with the late John Peel for Home Truths on Radio 4, six years ago. She talks about retiring then.

I have applied before but never received anything, most of them are filmed in London which is too far to go.But today I have a Priority E-ticket to go and see Justin Lee Collins hosting a game show called Heads or Tails, on Tuesday 13th October, at the Granada Television Studios in Manchester. I'm really chuffed, it will be interesting to see what goes on behind the cameras, the bit that doesn't get screened.There are a lot of rules and regulations to keep to, I won't be able to take photo's, and I have to wear something colourful. It says the audience is a very important part of the show, we have to come ready to enjoy our visit, but we have got help them to facilitate this by following the directions and instructions that the staff may give us. Does that mean we have to leap up and down clapping like demented seals at feeding time, when instructed to do so? When I have occasionally caught bits of these game show type programmes I always wondered what the audience have been taking to cause such hysteria, now I shall find out. I will report my experiences on here."}, {"title": "It's on the cards", "date": "Wednesday 23 September 2009", "text": "I've got a wedding to go to on Friday, my nephew Adam and his girlfriend Gemma are tying the knot. I thought they might appreciate a home made card as they are both into saving money, and not wasting it. This is what I have come up with. The colours haven't come out too well because of the flash. It's a white card with a roughly cut piece of red fine netting over it. The heart is from and old card, I have covered it with clear sticky back plastic to strengthen it, and stitched it on with running stitch in yellow embroidery thread. The picture is a couple of love birds dressed in their Sunday best. Each letter is cut out seperately, from a roll of gold sticky backed foil, and stuck onto some shiny red card to give them a red border. Then they are stitched onto the card. The red ribbon bow is off a chocolate box, (never throw anything away), and attached with four coloured stars. I am really pleased, it looks a lot better than the photo. Inside the front you can see the stitches, all neat and tidy I might add. So to cover them up I put an insert in which I did on the computer.A few words and a picture of their new baby, held in place with yellow embroidery thread. I think they will like it, something to keep and a bit more personal than a shop bought one. Looking at all my card making bits in the cupboard, I think it's time I was getting it all out again and make a start on the Christmas cards."}, {"title": "Putting the garden to bed", "date": "Tuesday 22 September 2009", "text": "The veg garden is looking a bit sad, now that we are getting towards the end of the growing season. It's been a good summer for putting fresh veg on my plate, and I shall be a bit sad when it is all over and I have to go back to buying it from the supermarket.I still have some potatoes left, a few carrots and onions, four cabbages, and a few spriggs of broccoli, but the beans are all finished, and so are the courgettes. It's time for the Autumn tidy up to start I think. I don't relish the job of pulling the dead plants up and stacking them on the compost heap, but it has to be done.My tomatoes have been a long time coming but now I have them in abundance, I am eating several every day. There are a lot of green ones which will never ripen, so I'll be cutting them up, cooking them for a few minutes, and freezing them in margarine tubs. These will be handy for adding to my winter stews. I know most people make chutney but I don't like it. I've still got some huge cucumbers which are a great accompaniment for my cheese sandwiches.With a bit of luck I should be getting some brussel sprouts as the plants look strong and healthy underneath the net curtain covers. That definately did the trick with keeping the dreaded butterflies from laying their eggs all over them.I am not looking forward to the nights drawing in and limiting my time outdoors, the seasons seem to go by so fast."}, {"title": "Matching bags", "date": "Monday 21 September 2009", "text": "Remember the gazebo roof that had been dumped in a skip and I pulled it out and brought it home? Well there's loads more fabric left after I made a couple of bags with it, so I made two more. I like the handy size of the Tesco wine bags which carry six bottles, so I used one for a pattern and copied it. This is it. I didn't put the dividers inside though so it can be used for general shopping. I made the decoration on the front by fusing together plastic bags. There is six layers of green, with letters and hearts added, all sandwiched between clear plastic, and ironed. If you are going to do this be sure to put greaseproof paper top and bottom to protect your iron. Then I stitched it on with a zigzag stitch on the machine. It looks very eyecatching.

After three days in the house I was ready for another walk. There is an Open Studios event at the Ropewalk, a contemporary arts and craft gallery in Barton on Humber, 13 miles away, I thought it would be a good idea to walk there and get the bus back.I set off at 10.50am and walked for three hours then stopped at South Ferriby for a rest and a bite to eat, my feet were already getting a bit sore then, I had done 8 miles. After changing my socks, I decided to get the bus to Barton, what a relief to sit down.There were some very interesting people to chat to at the gallery, fascinating to watch them at work. Artists painting, a young lady was weaving with a very complicated looking loom, a graphic artist was designing the cover for a book, and people were happy to explain how they made their designs. I was so busy talking I didn't notice the time, and as the sun was still shining I thought it would be a good idea to make the most of it and start walking back along the side of the river. I walked the five miles to South Ferriby, and found there was a bus due in ten minutes so I sat on the bench and waited fot it. The trouble was, it didn't go into my village so I had to get off and walk the last two miles home, it was getting dark by now and to walk on a road without a footpath is a little bit crazy, I had to keep jumping onto the grass verge as yet another hothead sped by me.The last half hour was a real struggle, I wanted to collapse in a heap, then I saw the lights of my village, so head down and go for it, I got home at 8pm. I still try and walk the same distances now as I did thirty years ago, well there's no harm in setting goals is there. My poor feet feel like they are on fire, hardly surprising after 15 miles."}, {"title": "What a worry", "date": "Friday 18 September 2009", "text": "I'm well and truly scrubbed up clean tonight, I have hot water. So what did I do? Have a bath of course, the first one since July.....2008 ha ha. Lit the candles, opened the wine, and laid back in a swirl of Peony Bath Relaxant Foam by Bronnley. My friend gave it to me last year when I came out of hospital and she very kindly invited me to have a bath at her house. At last I am able to use it again.As I laid there I felt a bit guilty, it was an awful lot of water, seemed such a waste on one person. And to send it all down the plug hole when I had finished, oh dear, should I save it for flushing the toilet or watering the garden? Maybe not this time as it's getting late, but perhaps I could bath in the daytime and scoop it out with a bucket.It seems strange turning a tap on and getting hot water. When I washed my dishes earlier, the first thing I did was to boil the kettle, then it dawned on me, old habits die hard. I'm not sure I like the idea of heating a whole tank full of water when you only need a bit in a bucket or bowl. Seems daft to store hot water, for it only to cool down and heat up again, and again, and again.Now I've got this white box on my kitchen wall, saying 'Look at me, I'm going to cost you a lot of money.' I think I might switch it off, and carry on boiling the kettle to wash the dishes. And why soak your whole body when you only want to soak your feet? I wonder if I should switch the water on once a month to have a bath, and go back to the old way of washing bits of me in the kitchen sink.All these decisions I have to make now, it was much simpler when nothing worked, no heating no hot water. Now I have to decide how cold I need to be before I put the central heating on. How much money do I want to spend, is this goodbye to my very cheap bills, will I be crying every three months when that dreaded British Gas envelope drops onto the door mat. I don't think I can cope with all this, I think I'll move into a cave."}, {"title": "Mustn't grumble", "date": "Thursday 17 September 2009", "text": "I am one step closer to having a working central heating system, not sure if I really want it, but it is free. The gas men came today to fit a new boiler, thanks to the government's concerns that I might freeze to death this winter.The lady on the phone said they would be here at 8.30, they arrived at 9.45, but I mustn't grumble. After closer inspection of suitable places to position said boiler, it was decided to ignore the first inspectors report which recomended it go in the airing cupboard in my bedroom. The kitchen wall which is an outside wall was a far better choice, logical I thought.Once the plan had been established they set to work, moving furniture, taking carpets up, pulling floorboards up, removing the gas fire in the front room and sealing off the back boiler behind it, then replacing the fire. When I cleaned up afterwards I noticed that the carpet was wet, someone obviously hadn't been very carefull, but mustn't grumble. My three cats made a hasty exit when the deafening noise of the drilling started, there was dust everywhere, but mustn't grumble. The hot water tank was too big to fit in the space in the airing cupboard where the old one had come out, so at this point they stopped work to make a phone call to order another one for tomorrow. Another error by the first inspector, I can't remember seeing him measure it up, but mustn't grumble. So tomorrow they will be back to finish the job.

I had a fantastic mini holiday, walking in Yorkshire. I set off on Friday lunchtime and had a look round Saltaire near Bradford in the afternoon. Picturesque Saltaire is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The village has been preserved in all it's Victorian glory. They have an Arts Festival on over ten days, and as I don't know the story of Saltaire I thought it would be a good opportunity to combine a visit with my holiday. I spent a couple of hours getting my bearings, street map in hand, and decided to visit again over the weekend because that's when most of the activities and entertainment was taking place.I got to the Youth Hostel at Haworth at 5pm.A beautiful Victorian mansionYou meet some very interesting people at Youth Hostels. I was there four nights, and one of my room mates was a lady in her sixties who was walking from Edinburgh to Manchester. Another was a young lady from Tiawan, on her way to Newcastle University to start her course. Then there was the couple from New Zealand who were touring the UK for five weeks, their daughter, who now lives in the UK was also staying there with her friends. Another lady I got chatting to was in her seventies and goes hosteling regularly, she loves it. I sat in the lounge on the Friday night, studying my maps and working out which footpaths I was going to follow, and got chatting to a friendly chappie. After an hour we were getting on great, so he asked me if he could come along on my walk the next day. I said yes, nice to have some company.It was a fantastic day, we ambled through Haworth main street, had a look at the church then set off. I did the map reading and oh dear, we got lost a couple of times. We had a bit of everything, tramping through fields, sloshing through boggy moors, scrambling up steep banks, climbing rocks, and marching along the road. I couldn't resist stopping at a lovely country pub and partaking of a half pint of Theakston's Old Peculiar, my favourite ale. We had such a laugh. The highlight was when we sat on a big rock on the top of Penistone Country Park, it had fantastic views. Suddenly overhead we looked up to see the Red Arrows passing, what a bonus. On the way back I needed to dive behind a bush, as you do, so my friend walked on. I noticed a lot of scraps of paper strewn about and saw that there was a letter and some membership cards. I was just thinking that some people are so inconsiderate littering the place up, when I noticed a handbag with most of it's contents still inside. I was shocked and wondered what had happened to the woman who owned it. I picked all the bits up and found a wallet with bank cards in it, and two cheque books. My friend came looking for me as I had been gone a long time. We decided to take it straight to the police station, but found it was locked, so I used the phone on the wall to talk to someone. It transpired that the bag had been reported stolen from a car, they said they would contact the owner and she would ring me to arrange to pick it up. I got a phone call half an hour later, the police said the lady was about to go on holiday and a police officer would collect it the following morning. I was relieved to hear that she hadn't been attacked, and pleased she was going to get her bag back, even though she had probably lost some cash and had cancelled her credit cards. Here are some pictures from our day out.My walking friend, Lester.The main street in Haworth. The steep cobbled street is lined with flower boxes at the front of each house. We had a look at Haworth Railway Station. We don't have time to travel on a train today.Haworth Church at the top of the main street. the Bronte's are buried in a vault inside the church, except for Anne who was buried at Scarborough.The Red Arrows have just flown over the top of Penistone Nature Park.On the Sunday I went back to Saltaire and picked up a free directory of all the houses which were open to the public. It's a bit like the Open Gardens idea when people invite everyone to come and have a look round, only this is to come in and view what crafty things they have made, or pictures they have painted. It seemed very cheeky to step into people's front rooms and have a nose around, but they were all very friendly and keen to talk about their craft projects.I had a look round the huge Mill built in 1851 by Sir Titus Salt, it stands near the the River Aire, hence the name Saltaire. He also built all the houses nearby for his workers, and the church, and nearby Roberts Park. The whole project took 25 years to build. The Mill now houses art galleries, shops, and restaurants, many of David Hockney's works are displayed there. I hadn't taken much notice of his creations before, but now I am well and truly hooked, the man is a genious. Saltaire Mill.The former Congregational Church built by Sir Titus Salt.  Typical narrow cobbled streets.Later in the afternoon I had a walk to the Shipley Glen Tramway, but unfortunately it was closed, so I carried on further up onto Baildon Moor, I just love spectacular views. The following day, Monday I had a full day's walking by myself, as my walking friend had gone home. I set off up the footpath from the Parsonage Museum, and headed towards the Bronte Waterfalls. Someone had mentioned that it was only a stream tumbling over some rocks, but I was determined to see it for myself. An hour and a half later I was there, it was a beautiful setting, massive rocks all around, steep sides reaching up to the sky. I sat for a while listening to the water trickling by. I carried on from here up to Top Withens, on the Penine Way, it's a farmhouse ruin on Haworth Moor thought to be one of the inspirations for Wuthering Heights. Blimey it was a long way, I seemed to be going forever. I was amazed to see a film crew when I got there, having their lunch in the ruin.On the way back I walked around Ponden Reservoir. Just when I think I should be starting to come back I think of a detour I can make to see something else. I looked at the map and decided to go to Oakworth and take a look at the railway station where they filmed The Railway Children. Oh boy, my feet are sore now, I must have walked about 13 miles, or possibly more, another mile and I can take these boots off. The sore feet only last a day or two though, can't wait to go out walking again."}, {"title": "What a laugh it was tonight", "date": "Thursday 10 September 2009", "text": "I've had them rolling in the aisles tonight, giggles, belly laughs, tears streaming down their faces, and hysterical side splitting laughter. My visit to the local heritage society was a barrel of fun, it is so much easier for me to tell my stories when they are enjoying my talk. There was about fifty people in the room, and they all went home in a merry mood. I started off with how I started the Lady Truckers Club, the events I organised for them, my radio and television appearances,  the three times I went to the Women of the Year Luncheon at the Savoy Hotel and met royalty, and the publicity shots I did in France with Sir Alistair Morton in the dining car of the euro tunnel train.Then I went on to talk about my appearance in Hunt for the Tightest Person in Britain on Channel four in January. I took along some of my bags to show them, and read out my list of money saving tips. I'm sure most of them didn't believe me when I said I put my widdle on my compost heap, and one woman said 'you don't really cook a meal in a saucepan and eat it out of there as well, do you.' Yep, I answered, 'why mess up a plate as well, it just makes more washing up, and I hate washing up.'The whole night was hilarious, someone asked me where I come from because I sounded just like Pam Ayres without the poetry. I just tell it like it is, open my mouth and surprise myself sometimes with what comes out.Anyway, I've got to get a few things together now, because I'm off to Yorkshire in the morning. I'm having a frugal holiday. I have booked myself into the Youth Hostel for four nights, at Howarth, near Bradford, Bronte country I believe.  It's a Victorian Mansion, here is the link  http://www.yha.org.uk/find-accommodation/yorkshire-dales-south-pennines/hostels/haworth/index.aspxVery reasonably priced as well, I have a bed in a dormitory and I shall be getting my own food.

I like bold, contrasting colours so I chose black and red for the bag, and added random coloured triangles for the decoration on the front. It's a shoulder bag, some of it is sewn with the machine, and some parts are hand sewn. The hardest part was sewing the gusset around the bottom corners of the front and back, as it was bulky and bunched up a bit. Pushing the needle through was not easy so the pliers were a help here. I have sewn through two buttons on each side to attach the strap. I didn't bother to line it because it would have been difficult to attach it to the edges of the bag. The fastening is red plaited elastic over a yellow button. It looks very eyecatching but I won't be using it because I have left it at the Scrapstore to illustrate my idea, maybe someone else will be inspired to have a go and make one."}, {"title": "I feel seasick", "date": "Tuesday 8 September 2009", "text": "I'm back, cheers and tears of delight and relief.

I decided that me and Ben should have a couple of hours at the Epworth Agricultural show, I say a couple of hours because I'm not sure if the old boy is up to doing any more due to his wonky back legs. He could probably manage one circuit of the field.Getting him in and out of the car is no easy job. The footwell isn't big enough for him so his entry and exit has to be through the back door of my estate car. This is a bit too high so I had the idea of making some steps for him. I got the wheelie bin laid down against the back bumper, and a big plastic storage box upside down next to it, and covered it with a piece of carpet, this made two steps up. He was a bit nervous but with some biscuits scattered inside as an incentive, he managed to haul himself in. In previous years I have never seen anything of the show because I was always working on my stand selling fancy goods and giftware, so it was nice today to have an amble around. Ben thought it was wonderful to sniff so many other dogs, and hoover up the bits of food that people had dropped. His prize find was a whole sausage. I met a few people I know, my friend Polly was a judge in the dog show, Anita and Alan with their rescue Labrador, another friend with her Dalmation, and some people I know showing their classic cars. I took a few photo's.There were three alpacas, haven't they got lovely faces. Nearby was a lady with a spinning wheel demonstrating how to spin the wool.This shire horse decided to do a whoopsie, the man leading it is waiting for it to finish before he moves on. Bernese Mountain Dog. There was a team of these dogs, each one had a wooden cart full of flowers to pull.This Morris car has been chopped in half and converted into a mini truck, it has exhaust stacks on the back.I was very impressed with these fabulous blooms in the Flower and Produce tent. We both enjoyed our visit to Epworth Show."}, {"title": "Handsome boy", "date": "Sunday 30 August 2009", "text": "I have a lodger for a week, my best friend Ben is staying with me. He is a lovely steady old plodder, so gentle and kind, he gets on with anybody. Don't you think he is a handsome boy?I have to make a few alterations while he is here. He knows there is cat food about and would demolish it given the chance, so I have to move their three trays from the living room into the bedroom. This confuses the cats for a couple of days, they look at the empty space and say, 'Ok, what have you done with it now?' Then I have to put a barrier across the bottom of the stairs so Ben can't sneak up when I am not looking.He is a crafty old so and so. Yesterday I hadn't seen him for 20 minutes and panicked when I couldn't find him anywhere in the house. I looked out into the garden, and there he was, enjoying a sniff around the hedge bottoms. My garden is not fully secure, goodness knows what might have happened if he had wandered further. The only way he could have got out there was through the cat flap, I was amazed because I thought he was too big to go through it, but I suppose, where there's a will there's a way. Now I have put the cat scratching post in front of the hole so the cats can still squeeze through.Bugsy and Lilly are fine about Ben being here, he has been brought up with cats so no chance that he might fight with them. But Freddie has gone a bit sulky, he stands his ground and threatens Ben. This is his territory and he doesn't like it being invaded by some alien from another planet. Freddie will hiss and spit, and lash out in an attempt to drive Ben away. Poor Ben retreats because he is such a gentle soul, and I have to be vigilant and make sure Freddie doesn't go the whole way and jump on him.What fun and games I am going to have for the rest of the week. At least I can take Ben to his own house for a few hours to give Freddie a stress break. Ben also needs some restfull times because he is not so good on his back legs. We can't go long walks any more, just several short strolls around the nearby churchyard. Yesterday the Church was open so we called in for a chat with some of the ladies who were doing the flower arrangements.Everything will have to be worked around Ben this week, so I won't be going far. I don't think it's right to have pets and then keep them locked up for hours on end. The cats are more independant and don't need constant supervision, so I can go out for a long day, they are fine till I get back.

What was it, Ten Years Younger, or something like that. There was two women who looked a lot older than their years, one of them had the full works under the surgeons knife, and the other had non surgical treatments. They both had their teeth fixed, hair done, and were fitted out with a whole new wardrobe of clothes, and both were delighted with their new image. I suddenly realised that I have let myself go a bit just lately, and looked much the same as the before version on the tele. Today I decided to do something about it, a visit to a few charity shops should kit me out with some bright new clobber. My friend was delighted when I told her, she said, you always wear baggy clothes, which is true, I like to be comfy. It was my intention to get some colour into my life instead of the drab dark clothes I usually wear.  Anyway, the Oxfam shop had a sign up saying all clothes 50p, I went through all the racks, and found this, a nearly new fleecy jacket. Perfect and what a bargain. Then I went to the Scope shop and found another bargain, just what I want, another pair of walking boots. I tried them on, perfect, well broken in by the previous owner, so hopefully no blisters for me. A snip at only \u00a32. I also found another nice jacket, a bit thicker than the other one, perfect for dog walking in, almost new and a good make. At \u00a33.50 I felt it was good value. I also bought a pair of brown cord trousers for \u00a33, very smart. When I got home I found that both the jackets are reversible, so that's a bonus. So that's me kitted out for winter.My new image looks like it is not going to materialise just yet, I just can't find anything that is cheap and fashionable, and warm and comfortable.

When I started the blog I thought I might do it for a year. One year of frugal living, money saving, and how to live within your means. I've had plenty of practice. I had an operation last year and needed twelve weeks off work to recover, then lost my job and became unemployed in October. You could say my enforced retirement started ten months early, rather than the actual date three months ago. But here I am, eight months into my blog, and always something to write about. Life is grand. This is my latest bag, made out of fourteen zips I got from the Scrapstore. It is quite small, 18cm x 13cm, so it's more like an evening bag. I was limited by the colours I have, and the metal zips make it quite heavy, but it is all hand stitched. The handle has a leather stiffener inside it and is covered with the same fabric as the lining, from a dress I got for 20p at a car boot sale. I am going to put a simple press stud on the inside to fasten it, as inserting another zip along the top would make it too bulky. The colours on the photo's are a shade lighter than the actual colours, and on the other side the zips are in a slightly different sequence, there is two blue and one pink. It looks quite trendy and quirky, maybe Iwill have to have a night out to try it."}, {"title": "On top of the world", "date": "Tuesday 25 August 2009", "text": "The weather forecast is wet and windy for Wednesday, so I thought I had better take myself off for another day out today. I fancied going to Bradford and Saltaire, looks pretty interesting, art galleries etc, but I noticed in the brochure that there is an arts festival on next month, so I think I'll wait till then. Now, where to go where I won't be battling my way through zillions of holiday makers? Derbyshire again? Plenty of big open spaces, maybe a bit further than my previous trip to Hathersage. Studying the Ordnance Survey map I see there is a reservoir with a forest on one side, hilly terrain, and a maze of footpaths surrounding it. Perfect, I printed off the maps.I arrived at Bamford at 12 noon, and found my first footpath down a lane, then turn left between a big old mill and some modern houses. This is what I found, magic. A pond with ducks, water tumbling over the weir and over the stones, and a footpath through it made of rocks and wooden boards. I lingered a while listening to the rush of the water and enjoying the sun, a great start to my walk. I carried on over the wooden bridge and into a field.All the signposts were very well marked, I decided to follow the Derwent Valley Heritage Way a short distance past Yorkshire Bridge, to the dam at the bottom of the Ladybower Reservoir. My plan was to walk the route anti clockwise along the waters edge for a while, then turn left through the forest, climb the hill out the other side and return via Win Hill, and the village of Thornhill. As I stopped for a few minutes at Yorkshire Bridge, dark clouds blew overhead and decided to release a few hundred gallons of water, I dived for cover underneath some large trees. I don't like to be laden with a heavy backpack on a day out so I just take the bare essentials, food, drink, camera, phone, shorts to wear if hot, sweatshirt to put on if cold. I wouldn't go out walking if there was going to be continual downpours, the odd shower here and there is not a problem, I just find some shelter. If I get wet, so be it, it's only water. The clouds blew over in a few minutes and gave way to brilliant sunshine as I reached the dam over the reservoir. This photo is looking south, down onto the water works, away from the lake. Then I turned round and took a photo looking to the north over the water.I walked a good distance following the curve of the reservoir on my right and the forest on my left, then turned left up a steep bank through the trees. I thought I was at the top and my first instinct was to turn left but then after checking the map I realised if I did that I would miss Win Hill, so I climbed even further through more trees untill I reached the open, heather clad hills. The view was fabulous. There was a lack of signposts up here, maybe the sheep or the wind had knocked them over, so I followed what appeared to be a well worn wide path through the heather, in the direction of a mound of rocks, this looks like it could be Win Hill. Getting closer I could see the path up to the top, wow, how exciting, I was thrilled with a big grin on my face. I looked back to admire the view and savour every moment. Following me up was a couple of young fit and healthy looking guys running after me, I couldn't believe my luck, ha ha. I stood aside and they passed. Alas they were not running after me, but looked like they were on a training programme, they turned round and dashed straight back down again after reaching their goal. My ascent was a lot more leisurely, I ambled to the top taking care not to loose my footing on the uneven rocks, oh dear forgot to pack my crampons :-) Looking down at Lady bower Reservoir. Looking the other way towards Castleton and Hope. It was very windy, nearly got blown off. I feel like I am on the top of the world :-)It was downhill all the way now. A couple more photo's before I reach the bottom.As I got back into Bamford at 6pm I saw a big house with a notice board at the front of the driveway, I stopped for a nosey. It was a Quakers House, and to the side of it was a communal garden I couldn't resist taking a look. It was laid out like allotments, I don't know much about Quakers, but I believe they share their food. It was in a lovely setting, down a private lane.I don't think I will get another day out for a week or two, I have some dog sitting coming up. Ben is an old dog so it will only be short walks close to home. Still, it will give me a chance to do some research and find more places to visit."}, {"title": "Not buying veg", "date": "Sunday 23 August 2009", "text": "The veg garden is still providing me with lots of food, I am pleased to say. My cucumbers are doing really well, and now at last I have some tomatoes. Most of them are still green though so it looks like I might be cooking and freezing a lot of them.I took the cover off the brassicas today to weed underneath them and to put some fresh canes in to keep them upright. The sprout plants are massive and looking healthy, and there are some cabbages coming along. Thankfully the net curtains over the top has kept the butterflies off. I still have beans in abundance and have started to freeze them, but the courgettes have slowed up a bit. I pulled some onions and had three for my dinner tonight, they went in the steamer with the potatoes, beans, and broccoli. I've still got some carrots, beetroot, and turnips left. I have made a new salad box, in a washing up bowl, the last one has just been dumped on the compost heap. They last me ages, I just keep picking a few leaves for the meal I am having, leaving the rest to grow.

I get the feeling today is going to be a walking day, but I'm not sure where to go. It's too late to make it a full day out so I think it has to be somewhere not too far away as I don't want to drive for miles. I am only ten miles from the Humber Bridge, and it is a sunny morning, seems like a good idea to walk across it, and explore the other side. I need a map, thank goodness for the internet where any map you want is free. Of course they don't let you have the whole map, but that's fine, I only want the bits of where I am going to walk. I printed off six sections and stuck them together.At 12 noon my car was parked on the south side of the River Humber, near the footpath up onto the bridge. This is the start.On the bridge, a little way along...Now I am over the other side, looking down onto the country park, the old windmill and the pub/restaurant, That's the A63 out of Hull on the right which leads onto the M62 across the Pennines to Liverpool. This part of the north bank stretches as far as Goole. I walked as far as you can see, along the waters edge. The path is part of the Yorkshire Wolds Way, which leads onto the Trans Pennine Trail, and is suitable for walking and cycling. Looking back at the bridge.  As you can see the shore line is pebbles, rocks, and mud, not a good place for a paddle, ha ha. I sat on the rocks and ate a sandwich. I carried on past North Ferriby then turned right onto a footpath through Long Plantation, which goes through the woods, then turned right into the village. I like to spend a few minutes of contemplation in a church, I am not religeous but it seems appropriate to say my thanks for such a lovely life. I wrote a little prayer request and hung it on the tree, for Henry, my friends dog who is having an xray on Monday, I hope God prays for animals. The bridge seems an awful long way away now, stretching over the water in the distance, I walked towards it along the road. I wanted to walk back over it on the eastern footpath to get a different view, but they had closed it due to roadworks. So with my head down my pace quickened as I tackled the final leg of the walk. At 5.30pm I was back in my car, pleased with my half day out, I estimate it to be about 13 miles."}, {"title": "Double bonus bargains", "date": "Friday 21 August 2009", "text": "I got a double bonus today. Firstly I decided to cash in \u00a310 of my points vouchers, and get \u00a320 back, at Tesco Customer Service. You can only do this in certain departments, you can't spend them on general food. I thought it might be a good idea to get a few bottles of wine.My six bottles, three red and three white, came to \u00a323.68, then I got a multibuy discount of \u00a31.19, and the \u00a320 off left me with \u00a32.49 to pay. Yippeee, wonderful. I know I spent money in Tesco to get the vouchers, but they don't make anything out of me because most of what I buy is special offers or reduced to pence on the last date, so I consider my vouchers as free gifts. The second bonus was this...Found on a reduced trolley tucked away at the back of the store at the end of an aisle. Stackers filled with nails and screws. Each pot screws into the other, five in a stack with a red lid and handle on the top pot. Guess how much??? 5p a stack, amazing. I bought all seven, you cant have too many screws and nails. Great bargain find."}, {"title": "Catchup day", "date": "Thursday 20 August 2009", "text": "I've been a bit busy these last few days, tied up with dog sitting. One perk of that was I found blackberries in abundance while out walking Henry. They are now as juice in my refrigerator. I don't like the bits in blackberries so the best option for me is to add water, cook them for a few minutes, and put them through a sieve. It takes a bit of time to do squash them all down to mush, but I really can't stand the pips. No point in blending they would still be there.I'm having a catch up day at home, the lawn looks more like a meadow so the mower will have to come out soon. I try and leave it as long as I can between cuts, this reduces the amount of electricity I use, sorry I am not buying a hand mower there is too much lawn.I shall have to go to town in a bit, bank and pay a bill. I shall also pop in the Arts Centre. There is a wonderful exhibition in there at the moment, worth a second look, and I have a voucher for a free cup of coffee, got to claim it before the end of the month.In between these jobs I have to walk Ben a couple of times because his owner has gone out for the day, and night. I might bring him here for a while so he wont be lonely. He can come into the garden with me while I do a bit of weeding. Must go, loads to do.

It could be used as book shelves as it is strong and sturdy, or in the greenhouse or potting shed. Or it could be used for tool storage in the garage. You could make it taller, wider, or deeper depending how many pallets you had. You could make it smaller and stand it on a cupboard against a wall. I used batons (free from work) to hold it together but you could improvise with pallets. I got the varnish for a few pence on the last day Woolies closed down.

I am thinking I need to travel a bit further afield. The leaflet for the North Yorkshire Moors Railway looks interesting, so after making my packup I drove to Pickering, arriving at 11.45am. I checked the timetable and saw there was a train leaving at noon, so I quickly legged it to the station from my free parking place in the street on the edge of the town. Just made it with a minute to spare and plonked myself down opposite a middle aged couple and soon started a conversation.  There are four stops before the train arrives at Whitby. I decided I didn't want to go that far because I wanted to get some time walking as well, so I got off at Grosmont, the last stop before the end. This is Grosmont.... it's a silent 's' by the way.I noticed that they were moving the engine on the front and went to have a closer look to get a better shot, isn't it lovely, so exciting. Then I had a look around the engine sheds, and treated myself to an ice cream, before I set off walking back to Goathland, the station before this one, it's just under four miles. The path follows the old railway line and runs alongside the river and the new track. Parts of it were very steep, at one point I could hear the chug chugging of the train but couldn't see it because I was deep in the woods, very frustrating. There are still remnants of an old bridge, big stone pillars in the middle of the river where the rail track was wider than the pathway. The water running over the rocks in the river was a great attraction for the children scrambling over them. This is a place called Mallyan Spout.  I arrived at Goathland by the side of a big hotel opposite the church and sat on a bench for a bite to eat. The sheep are not penned in and are left to wander all over the road. Goathland is where they film Heartbeat, which is called Aidensfield in the series. It is very touristy and commercialised, it's a shame the shop fronts had awful special offer, and bargains stickers all over the windows.  This is the train approaching the station that I caught back to Pickering.I arrived back at 6pm, had a look round the town, the church, and the castle. There isn't a lot left of the castle, mainly just ruins, there is a path that you can walk around the perimeter.

I love my days out, grabbing the opportunity whenever the weather looks ok. The number 163 bus dropped me in New York Street, opposite the Kirkgate Market. This is a massive indoor and outdoor market with traders selling everything you can think of. I had a browse and if I was shopping for food I would definately get my fresh fruit and veg there, plenty of bargains to be had. Three bags of cherries for \u00a31 and 24 peaches in a tray for \u00a32. Sadly not today, this is my sightseeing day.I bought one of those picture maps from a machine for \u00a31, it gave me two copies, and try as I may, I couldn't sell the extra copy for 50p. The map was invaluable for finding my way about. The Victoria Quarter was lovely, all the old shop fronts very tastefully modernised, I tried to imagine what it might have been like in the old days with the horse driven carriages clattering along the cobbles. Now it is pedestrianised with beautiful ornate ironworks and a glass roof with the sun beaming down. I couldn't resist going into Harvey Nicks, just to gasp at the extortionate prices. Looking around the ladieswear, I was shocked to see a shapeless piece of fabric that looked like a throw draped over a hanger, price tag \u00a31,000 :-0 I asked the nice young man assistant if anyone paid these prices. He said indeed they do, and showed me a coat priced at \u00a33,500, I was gobsmacked, people definately do have more money than sense. I could get something like that from my Hospice Charity shop for a tenner.Strolling along The Headrow, I came across people playing chess with giant pieces, on the pavement outside the Town Hall. They had a little audience of others waiting to take their turn.I went into the Library next door, which leads onto the City Art Gallery and the Henry Moore Institute. There was an amazing display of the Leeds Tapestries, depicting life in and around Leeds from days gone by. I spent a good hour looking around the exhibitions, I love modern art and trying to work out what was going through the artists mind at the time of creation. I wandered around City Square, a lovely area with fountains and statues, old and new buildings side by side. The Corn Exchange has a tastefully restored interior, a vast space with a coffee lounge on the lower floor, shops on the ground and upper floors. It was a shame that most of them were empty, a sign of the present economic climate I think. Looking up at the ceiling you would think you were underneath an upturned boat. Parts of the Waterfont have been transformed from ugly dock warehouses into modern blocks of flats. The old style renovated buildings, and the new and modern are side by side, with cobbled pathways and outdoor eating areas joining the two. I walked over this Centenery Footbridge.

Then I tried these shapes the other way round, the silver side on the outside, but it didn't look very interesting, so I decided to incorporate colour into it. I keep changing my mind as I make these bags, sometimes it works brilliantly, sometimes it's just ok. I cut these shapes from various aluminium drinks cans, then punched the holes in them and used black wool to crochet around the sharp edges. I stitched them onto the front of the bag. The buckle fastening is a cat collar. For the lining I used a piece of fabric from a dress I bought at a car boot sale for 20p.

Good enough reason I suppose, but I'll explain. When I go out I have a plan of things to do, if all those things are in one place then fine, I can go on the bus. I might have a trip to town and go to the bank and the library and the market, all within walking distance of the bus station.But what if there is a special offer on of Felix cat food in the market and I want to buy loads because it's cheap. I cant because it is too heavy to carry, and I'm certainly not old enough to get one of those trolley things. And what if I pop into the bargain shop and see they have some dry cat food which is a good price, again too heavy to carry.I might need to do some food shopping, but how can I find the special offers and reduced prices when the big four supermarkets are dotted all over the place? Do you think I could get the bus driver to do a tour for me, and wait while I make my purchases, I don't think so, and how do I carry it when I walk from the bus stop to home?I am in the habit of calling in places as I am passing, at a certain time, that's how I get really cheap food a fraction of the price. Buses to and from my village pack up at 6 o clock, and you need to shop at 8 o clock for bread that is 10p a loaf. So using my bus pass to get my food shopping is going to bump up my food bill astronomically, because I wouldn't be able to get the bargains.What if I see something in a skip that I want to take home, or pick up a couple of pallets for the garden. Imagine if I asked the bus driver to stop when I see a skip that is overflowing with usefull stuff, would he wait while I had a rummage through it, probably not.You just don't get the flexibility with a bus like you do a car, that's why I am not using my bus pass very often."}, {"title": "Saving money in the kitchen", "date": "Sunday 2 August 2009", "text": "I don't like to spend too much time in the kitchen, just enough to cook myself a quick and simple meal. I can't be doing with faffing about with loads of post and pans, mixing this, and chopping that, slaving over a hot stove is not my idea of fun. My meals have got to be cost effective, cheap but nutritious, and quick to prepare, because I don't want to be in there longer than I need to. I rarely use the oven because it uses too much gas, and I hate cleaning it. Cleaning the top and grill is bad enough, but my head in the oven, definately a no no.I don't fry any food, (a) because it's bad for you, and (b) because it creates a greasy pan to wash, and (c) it spits all over the top of the cooker, and (d) greasy wash up water blocks drains, another hidden cost.Another reason for keeping the use of kitchen utensils to a minimum is that it costs money to wash them, the cost of the water, heating the water, and the washing up liquid. This might seem a pifflingly small amount of money to save on a daily basis, but if you multiply it by 365 it can add up to a quite lot pounds. For instance I can make a bottle of washing up liquid last for almost a year.So taking all these things into consideration, one of the cheapest ways for me to make a meal is to steam my veg in one of these. I have just bought a new one for \u00a32, the old one has been in use for about 8 years and was looking pretty grotty. In my mind, this is the best kitchen gadget ever invented. It fits most pan sizes, you can put all your veg in here together, and if you use a big pan there is enough for three people. You put an inch of water in the bottom, bring to the boil, and put on a low heat for six minutes, and it's ready. Tonight I had a massive plate of veg from my garden, potatoes, turnips, courgettes, onion, peas, and runner beans, with a piece of cod grilled in foil. Even the foil had been used before.

Every morning I look out of the window and think, should I go out today, then the heavens open and that answers my question. However, this morning it didn't look too bad so I decided to go for it. I set off at 10.30am, battled my way through Sheffield, and arrived at Hathersage at 12noon, 53 miles away. The peacefullness of the countryside was a relief after all that traffic earbashing.I found a quiet street to park. Hathersage is in the Derbyshire Peak District, on the A6187 between Sheffield and Chapel en le Frith. I took an Ordnance Survey map with me and had a good idea of the route I wanted to walk. I always think it is better to plan a bit rather than wandering around aimlessly. I also like to keep a record of my walks. The map of my local area has almost every footpath highlighted with a marker pen, I have walked them all. I love map reading, and looking for the paths and stiles on the ground, a sort of adventure, and of course the bonus is the fantastic scenery. I walked up the hill to a church I spotted and found it was where Little John is buried, friend of Robin Hood. Here is the church and gravestone.Following my map I climbed the hill through a mixture of pretty lanes, farm tracks, open fields, and through woods. I bleated at the sheep, and nudged a few cows out of the way so I could pass. At one point I passed round the edge of a golf course, and stopped to help a man look in the hedge bottom for his lost ball, ha ha. I headed towards Bamford then crossed over the main road and the river. Passing Offerton Hall, a big posh farmhouse, I lingered a few minutes and wondered what it would be like to live there, it must be wonderful. This is my route. Hathersage is in a valley and the scenery is fabulous the higher you climb, you can see for miles.This is my spiritual home, anywhere up in the hills is heaven to me, wandering around the countryside, it's like I have a calling, a need to connect, and I have to do it by myself. I will come back to this area, a few miles further north is Ladybower Reservoir, worth a look I think."}, {"title": "Clever Henry", "date": "Wednesday 29 July 2009", "text": "I've been looking after Henry for a couple of days, at his house. You may remember I stayed with him for a week not so long ago, while my friend Helen went on holiday. He completely wore me out when I discovered that a Labrador puppy eats just about anything.In the space of five weeks he certainly has grown up a lot, in size and intelligence, what a handsome boy he is now. I can see that Helen's perseverance with dog training classes is paying off, and he isn't half as unruly as he was. He understands all the basic commands, and I can see that he will make a perfect companion. When I speak to him he listens intently and looks into my eyes. He recognises a lot of words, and will sit and offer his paw immediately when he knows a treat is coming his way.Yesterday we went a walk across the fields, he picked up the scent of something in the wind and his nose twitched, and his ears pricked up as he listened. If he was off the lead I think he would be charging across the field after something, but we didn't have much time. It's obvious he has an appetite for learning, for adventure and excitement.We only had a short walk today because it has been pouring with rain all day, so I made up a game to play indoors. I put him in another room so he couldn't see where I was hiding some of his treats. Then I let him back in and encouraged him to 'find'. His tail was wagging with excitement as he found each one, what a clever boy. I am glad that Henry is growing up, I can see that he will be a lot of fun."}, {"title": "Designs in wood", "date": "Monday 27 July 2009", "text": "Richard at http://www.downthelane.net/ has given us a bit of a challenge, it's a competition so there is a prize for the winner. We have to come up with a good idea to make something out of pallets, draw a plan and assemble it. Today I have been taking my pallets apart, not an easy task. I gathered my tools for the job, a big club hammer, a hammer with a nail claw, a big screwdriver, and a chisel. The idea is to dismantle them without damaging the wood.I had three huge pallets, they were about six foot long, they were in my garage so the wood is nice and clean. I managed to get them apart but I think it would have been a bit easier if I had a crow bar. Here is my pile of wood. I have a lot more wood in the garage, but I think it's ok to use it for the project as all of it was free, salvaged from skips or work. Now I need a good idea, I'm not sure whether to make something for the outdoors or indoors. I have a sander and some varnish so I suppose I could make a piece of furniture. No hurry we have got a month or two before the competition closes, I'll have a look round a few web sites."}, {"title": "A day not wasted", "date": "Sunday 26 July 2009", "text": "I set off this morning to go to Derbyshire, and stopped off at the car boot sale on the way out. I thought I might find a pair of trainers as mine are nearly at the end of their usefull life. I want black or any dark coloured ones, not those impractical white and pink ones. Found some but unfortunately the wrong size, never mind. Someone shouted 'everything 5p in this box', so I had a nosey through it and picked out a nearly new, white leather belt, bargain I thought. I felt spots of rain, and not a bit of blue in the sky. The rain got heavier and everyone started packing up and leaving. Not much fun walking in the rain, I thought, so I went home. So to plan B. Make a bag. I had some upholstery fabric offcuts from the Scrapstore, and found a template for a bag in a magazine. I cut two pieces back and front, a 2inch wide gusset, and a piece 2.5inches wide for the shoulder bag length strap. Before I stitched it together I put the decoration on the front. The red leaves were cut from another piece of upholstery fabric, I then painted the edges with clear nail varnish to stop it fraying. After sewing it on I put more varnish on to make sure it definately wouldn't fall apart, and then I added five red beads. I made the lining out of some thin grey fabric. The ends of the strap are sandwiched between the outer and inner layers, and luckily I had a black zip of the right length.Here is my new bag.It looks lovely, I am really pleased with it. the measurements are 7\" by 9\", and 2\" deep. Enough room for essentials, purse, phone, keys, etc. So the day was not wasted, I will get to Derbyshire one day."}, {"title": "Jobs in the garden", "date": "Saturday 25 July 2009", "text": "I couldn't decide whether to go out today or not. I looked at the map and thought I might go to Derbyshire, so I put the computer on and printed off some os maps of the Hathersage area. But, by the time I had checked Down The Lane Forum, clouds had started to drift over, and they said it might be showery in the afternoon. Perhaps I will work in the garden instead.Some of the peas are ready for taking out, I have them in plastic boxes on a pallet, which I built a frame round and covered the sides in shrink wrap, so it's quite easy to move things about. This left me with a space and as my tomatoes are rather cramped and not getting enough light, I was able to move some of them onto the pallet to make room to move the others about. The compost I had left from the peas I spread on the tomato plants, then I went round them all trimming some of the leaves off.The broad beans are nearly finished now so I cut the tops off some of them, they want taking out in the next few days, I can't be bothered to do it now. The compost heap is growing, a good time to add some of the shredded paper. There seems to be spuds and tomatoes sprouting up everywhere, that will teach me not to throw the potato peelings and rotten tomatoes on the compost heap.It looks like the hedges need a trim, so I got the shears and step ladder out and made a start. The hedge at the bottom of the garden is too high for me to reach all the way across the top, so I will have to go and ask the people in the bungalow round the corner if I can go into their garden to finish it off. Maybe next week sometimes for that job. I knew I should have worn something with sleeves for the hedge cutting, now my arms are sore and stinging with red blotches, from leaning over the conifers. I smothered them in aloe vera jelly and that made them sting more than ever, ouch!"}, {"title": "Turn your radio on", "date": "Thursday 23 July 2009", "text": "Well I don't know what's been going on, I haven't blogged because I have been unable to get logged in.

These computer things baffle me, anyway, lets get on with it before it decides it's going to cut me off.I wanted to tell you about my radio interview today, I went into BBC Radio Humberside at Grimsby, to chat with Lara Croft on the morning show. She comes on from 9 till 12. This is my third time on her programme, I think she likes me because I am a chatty person and we have a lot of fun together. I took her some potatoes fresh out of my garden which she was very pleased about. The chat is about topical subjects from the newspapers and I am given a cup of coffee while I browse through them to pick out my snippets. I had made a few notes to give her as well about what I have been doing, just to give her some ideas. It is so easy to chat with Lara, we are sat opposite each other in the studio and I follow her lead, answering her questions and adding what I think is appropriate. The whole thing lasts about half an hour, during that time she breaks off to do the weather, traffic reports, and jingles, and I carry on browsing the papers. Some of the chat was about my moderating duties on http://www.downthelane.net/ on the forum, she was interested in Battery Hen Rescue as she is very keen on happy chickens laying free range eggs. Then I told her about my skip diving, and collecting stuff for the Scrapstore. We finished off with a couple of items from the newspapers. I asked Andy on the desk to take our photograph,And this is Andy,If you want to listen the whole programme is on the iplayer here, I start about 18 minutes into it so you need to scroll forward. http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p003s3j8/Lara_Kings_Morning_Show_23_07_2009/Afterwards I went for a mooch around Grimsby. This boat is moored next to the Fishing Heritage Museum.This is a monument of a fisherman pulling his nets up over the side of the boat, outside St James's church. Around the base people had placed floral tributes to those fishermen who were lost at sea. I spent a few quiet moments inside the church to reflect on how lucky I am to be able to enjoy this lovely sunny day.  On the way home I stopped off in Immingham to visit Sheila, Jackie, and Anna, at the agency I used to work for. It was great to see them again and catch up on the news. I told them about the collecting I do for the Scrapstore, and they said I should go and ask the company round the corner that makes blinds, because they are very nice people and might have something to give me. They were indeed very nice people, and they gave me a load of end of roll, blind fabrics, all colours, I was very excited about this because I know they will be very much appreciated.I delivered my load on the way home and Lorraine was over the moon with it. We immediately cleared some shelf space in a prominent position for the rolls. I am sure I will be going back for more at some point, they said I could call in any time.

I was up at 5am this morning, and started work at 7am. The motorhomes we took to Pickering on Tuesday all had to come back again, so it was two trips in the mini bus, one lot went to the Laceby depot near Grimsby, and the others went to the Colsterworth depot on the A1 near Grantham.The sales team had a good weekend, they sold 20plus vans, amazing in this credit crunch when people are supposedly short of money. I think holidays in England are becoming more popular, and a motorhome would give you reasonably priced holidays for a good few years. Then you could sell the van when you have finished with it.The guys I work with are a happy bunch, we always have a good crack, jokes are flying about thick and fast. Of course I join in with all this banter, I can't help it. They start it by teasing me, and I come back with a cheeky answer, then I get drawn into my story telling. At one point they were all doubled up with laughing and the driver nearly drove off the edge of the road he was laughing so much.I admit I can get away with a lot more silly chat as I am the only female. It's great, they treat me as one of the boys. Nothing bothers me, they know I have an answer for everything, and will give as good as I get. I love it when I make people laugh.

I used to buy in hand made soap from a small family business, and sell it on at craft fairs and agricultural shows. Sales were slowing down and it was no longer worth doing all the work for so little in return, so I closed my business over two years ago. I sold off nearly all my stock at a much reduced price.I thought it was silly to let it all go, so I kept a large 2.2 kilo block back, with a fresh lemon and lime fragrance. It was in a drawer for a long time, the drawer smelt lovely, and a year ago I got it out and cut it into big chunks. I had the idea of using it as a room freshener, so I put it in plastic trays, and dotted it around the living room. It worked, the room smelt much fresher, a big improvement on the feline smells that sometimes wafted through. Sadly now the fragrance isn't quite so strong so maybe now is the time to start using it for it's original purpose. I think it's going to last me a long time, it still lathers up well, I wonder what it will be like when I get to the last piece?

So to celebrate my recovery I drove to Wetherby in North Yorkshire, where I stopped for a fish and chip lunch. Might seem odd to choose a chippy but this is a treat for me, I only have fish and chips about three times a year, I don't do fried food.Then on to Harrogate. It was bright when I set off but oh dear, the rain started, and never stopped all day. I parked at Sainsbury's on the outskirts and used my bus pass to get into town. I have driven through Harrogate plenty of times in the past, but never been to look round. I love all the flowers, they put a lot of effort into keeping the place neat and tidy. This is the world famous Betty's Tea Rooms, a big corner building, obviously very popular as people were queuing to get in. They have a shop as well, gazing longingly at the pastries and cakes made my mouth water, the prices made my eyes water :-( This Victorian shopping arcade is lovely. It's on two floors, with shops selling fine china and ornaments, pictures, and expensive furniture.I was a bit disappointed that some of the beautiful buildings have been spoilt with modern signage, this is a Chinese Restaurant. With my feet thoroughly soaked by now I headed home, thank goodness I had put spare shoes and socks in the car. As I was passing Tesco I called in to do a big shop so I could use my \u00a36 off voucher. I needed to make it to \u00a340 so I carefully recorded all the prices as I added the items to the trolley. There were several reduced price items from the chiller, the veg, and the bread counters, and when I had almost finished, I went back to these counters to see if they had added anything else. I was lucky, they had, but they had also reduced even further some of the items I had already chosen. I hope no one was looking when I did a quick swap. The best prices were, smoked salmon slices from \u00a32.49 to 62p, washed lettuce from \u00a31 to 25p, spinach from \u00a31.50 to 38p.

This is Teddy.He is so funny. He stops to look at something, then makes a mad dash, then stops again when something catches his attention, then runs off again. He is so entertaining, and what a cutie, couldn't you just fall in love with him! I took him for a walk with Ben, the two of them get on very well. Ben is an old boy, a steady plodder, and ambles along without his lead, I didn't let Teddy off his lead, he might not come back.:-0 After lunch I went to Winteringham to help my friend Helen walk her dog Henry, and the next door neighbours dog, Alfie. This is Henry, you may remember I stayed at his house and looked after him for a week recently.And this is Alfie looking through the fence, saying please take me for a walk.These two dogs are great friends, and Helen often fetches Alfie into her garden to play with Henry. We took them in her car to a quiet lane where they could both play off the lead. Helen threw a ball for them to chase, unfortunately her aim was not too good and it disappeared into a corn field. Neither dog could find it, and we were wading around in the corn looking for it when a tractor came along. I don't think the farmer was too impressed with all of us destroying his crop.

The countryside is looking lovely and golden at the moment, the fields are littered with massive bales of straw, and tractors pulling farm machinery are trundling up and down the roads. Everyone is busy getting the harvest in. Arriving at the Showground I was directed to an area designated for vehicle washing, they have to be in pristine condition to impress the public. I found Steve and Andy, our chief valeters, up to their elbows in soapy water. They are here for three days getting the stand ready. They soon made a start on the one I brought in, as soon as I was out of it and took my trade plates off, the pressure washer was fired up. This one sells for \u00a352,000Not long later, the other drivers turned up, so we all had a picnic on the grass before we went back in the mini bus.

It was a mad rush to get some scrambled eggs on toast for my tea, a quick change of clothes, then out.The ladies were waiting so I quickly set the projector and screen up and started immediately. They loved the talk, my sense of humour can be a bit erm, down to earth, no fancy big words, just open my mouth and see what comes out. I look around the room to read the expressions on their faces, that tells me a lot. Shock horror means tone it down a bit, fits of laughter means keep going, tell them some more stories like that. It's knowing how far you can push boundaries, and adapting your talk to suit the type of audience.I have no problem speaking to a large group of people, in fact the bigger the audience the easier it is. A few months back I had an audience who hardly raised a smile, nothing I said made any difference, they all sat there with blank looks.

I had a stroll round the dog pens and read some of the details of the dogs, which were on a board outside each pen. It was heartbreaking to see so many abandoned dogs waiting for some kind soul to take them home. I watched a little girl for a while who was looking longingly at a small friendly dog who was jumping up at the wire fence. I could tell she was smitten by it, I hoped her mum and dad would see how much she wanted to take it home. I couldn't look at all the dogs because I found it too upsetting, how could people abandon their pets! Maybe some of them had lost their owners for other reasons, still very sad when you think they might never find another home.We were very busy on the stand, a steady stream of enquiries, and we gave out lots of leaflets, lets hope some of them come to the Scrapstore for their crafting supplies.

I thought I had better go because if they think we are not bothered they might not save stuff for us again.They were like huge, very thick, toilet roll middles, all different sizes. The tyres started to look a bit squashy on the back because of the weight, so I thought I would only take half of what they had and promised to go back next week for the rest.After unloading them at the Scrapstore I went round to my tyre place to get them checked out, they told me in January that one on the back was getting towards the end of it's life, the tread being a bit low. He got his gauge out and declared they were all legal, so I got him to check the pressures. He said come back in a couple of months.By now it was lunchtime so it wasn't worth setting off anywhere with half the day gone, so after a sandwich, I set about taking some pallets apart that I have stored in my garage. I don't know what it is with me and pallets, if I see some good quality clean ones at the back of Wicks I can't drive by, I have to pick them up.

I met Becky in town then we went to meet a works manager from a well known furniture manufacturer, they make three piece suites. He showed us around the factory so we could see what kind of scrap they generate. It is such a big factory and they have so much waste, they sell as much as they can for recycling. There are large skips for cardboard, plastic bags, and wood, so they make money on those. But, we did get a lot of upholstery fabrics, some quite large pieces, and many different designs and colours. Also some leather offcuts, and leather sample swatches. The factory line manager was instructed to bring us out some sheets of wadding, foam sheets, and wood pieces. A fantastic find, my estate car was full to the roof, and we can go back there every two weeks.After unloading that, we went out again, this time to a factory we visited last week, the manager had rung and told us to come for more. They have massive bags of polystyrene beads, the type they put in bean bags, and they also had a lot of boater type hats they made but have some left over. These are ideal for children to decorate. Again the car was filled to the roof.After a cup of coffee and a biscuit back at the Scrapstore, we were suitably refreshed to go out again. I was now getting quite excited about finding more stuff. We went back to the vinyl man, and had another dive in his skip, he gave us a contact to visit who might be able to give us something, a small company that makes holdall type bags, so after we picked out a lot of wood from the skip next door, we went to see him. The boss was very enthusiastic about what we were doing, he said he would get some stuff bagged up for us and deliver it himself on Saturday. We had heard about a company that has massive sheets of foam on the same industrial estate, and managed to track them down. Sure enough a young lad brought it out to us on a pallet. After stuffing as much as we could into the car, we had to admit defeat and take it back to the Scrapstore, saying we would come back another day for some more.We are now beginning to build up good relations with several businesses, and regular collections are being organised, much better than throwing it all in a big hole in the ground. We are only able to do a little bit towards recycling, a lot more effort is needed.

It's so nice being able to pick fresh veg and have it on the plate within twenty minutes. I have an abundance of peas, but I am not sure which are mangetout and which are ordinary peas, as they are all mixed up. So I am eating them with the pods when they are small and flat, and shelling them if I have missed them and the peas are fat. There are loads of spuds in the raised beds and some in pots, I am sticking my hands down and pulling a few out at a time. The broad beans are nearly ready, and the first courgettes are appearing. It won't be long before the beetroot is ready, might pull some in the next few days, I love cooked beetroot. There are a few carrots ready so I am pulling them to make room for the rest to grow, same with the turnips. I have been eating the broccolli, should be quite a lot of that as the plants look big and healthy. The brassicas are under net curtains over a frame, I made the mistake of taking it off too early last year, so they are staying covered. With a bit of luck I will have sprouts and cabbages later on. The tomatoes are coming but won't be ready for a week or two, I was a bit slow at getting them started this year, also the cucumber plants are only a foot high, but they will come eventually.I'm surprised I haven't had as much trouble with slugs and snails this year, could that be because I have been collecting them up over the last two years, and there aren't many left I wonder."}, {"title": "Scrapstore day out", "date": "Sunday 5 July 2009", "text": "What a busy day we had today at the Winterton Show. I picked Becky up at 8.15 and ten minutes later we were pulling into the Showground. We found the marquee and unloaded, then set about errecting the stand. I had brought our own tables to keep costs down, so all we had was a ten foot square of grass to work in. Out pitch was in the centre, it would have been better against a side or back wall, but as it was a two day event and we didn't attend yesterday, all those pitches were taken. In this situation you have to think of other ways to build height into the display.As I have been building stands for three years in a previous business, I have a pretty good idea on how to make it eye catching to draw the visitors in. My dad once told me I should train to be a window dresser when I left school, advice I chose to ignore, but now I realise I could have excelled at it. Funny how things go round in full circle.Anyway this is the stand we built. It is two larger than normal, heavy, paste tables, one behind the other, with two smaller tables tagged onto the side. You have to be carefull not to encroach on your neighbours pitch, and to leave enough room to squeeze up the sides when you want to talk to a customer at the front. It's always a good idea to take more than enough equipment with you so you can build according to the space you have. I only ever buy the smallest pitch size, sometimes if you are lucky and your neighbour doesn't turn up, you are asked to fill the gap, because gaps look unsightly. So your extra table will come in handy, I like extra free space.You usually buy space by the frontage at a craft fair in a hotel or hall, you will only be allowed six foot, so it is a tight squeeze. My tables are a tad too long for this, so I try and get there early and shuffle all the tables in the row along a few inches so I can get mine in. Cheeky I know, but it has to be done. You sometimes see people with just one six foot table, not enough space to display all their stock, they sit behind it knitting or reading. I always double up on the depth, sometimes not leaving enough room at the back for a chair so I have to spend the whole day standing. This is the sacrifice you have to make if you want to maximise your sales area.It is important to build height into it, there is nothing more boring than a flat display with a bed sheet for a table cover. I have got two, two meter lengths of timber with three coathooks on each of them. I clamp these to the back of the table with the big metal clips they use on market stalls. The hooks are facing the front, these support three cross bars. Then I hang anything on there with plastic clips, my bags are ideal for this. I pack the stock into those collapsible plastic crates, as these are ideal for elevating the display, put three of them upside down at the back of the table and cover with a cloth.I've just found another photo of a stand I built at a cat show in 2004, it's a good example of using height and elevation. Thanks to Vince Hogan of Our Dogs magazine for taking the photo. You can just see one of the timbers behind me, I clipped them to the back of some plastic drawers I carry stock around in, which are against the back wall. You are not allowed to put anything on the wall itself, in case of dammage. Lightweight teeshirts are also ideal to hang on this, as well as the bags. On the table I have a wooden display unit I built out of wood, and covered it in red velvet. It's like a mini staircase, ideal for putting smaller items on, here I have mugs and ornaments on it.I digress, the day at Winterton went very well, we talked to lots of people and gave out a lot of leaflets. We are hoping a lot of them will visit the Scrapstore in the next few weeks. By 4pm the crowds were thinning out a bit, but a sudden downpour brought them all back into the marquee again, sometimes the rain is a blessing at a show, provided it doesn't last too long and send them all home.By 5pm were were packing up, and next Sunday we are doing it all again, at Jerry Green, a local dog rescue centre open day. I have booked more space for that one because it was a cheaper price.

There was a great party atmosphere last night, over 500 women most in their night wear or fancy dress, me in my pink nightie, it was a lot of fun.I decided to walk alone because I wanted to push myself hard and do it in the shortest time I could. We set off at 10pm from the football ground, and I was in the second bunch of thirty to get off. The pace was quite fast throughought, we had two curcuits of six miles each, with a twiddly bit in the middle making it a total of thirteen miles. The second circuit was the same as the first, in reverse.There was a lot of car horn hooting going on as we looked quite a spectacle, a lot of flashing lights on heads, mine were fastened to the waist band of my bumbag. Plenty of watering holes dishing out bottles of water and chocolates, and marshals, ambulances, St John's, as far as I could see no one needed their assistance but it was comforting to know they were there.The conditions were ideal, dry, slightly warmish, although my skin felt cool I was comfortably warm inside. I thought my feet might give me problems but they didn't, I wore an old pair of trainers, a bit like a comfy pair of slippers. I even managed to run part the way round the second circuit, overtaking a lot of young ones. On the last straight I could see the three hour looming, with seven minutes to go I had one last push, determined to be within the 1am deadline I set myself. I know it was supposed to be a fun walk, but I do like some element of competition, even if it is just competing against my own boundaries. I received my medal at 1am as I checked back in at admin.Breakfast was provided inside the football ground and I opted for the bowl of fruit as opposed to the bacon butty. I sat for ten minutes looking out over the pitch, imagining the roar of the crowd as a goal is scored, only ever hearing a real roar from the Tesco car park across the road. With my goody bag in my hand I got back in my car and drove the ten minutes home. Here is my medal.Today I feel great, pleased with my achievement, and looking forward to the day ahead, I'm off to the Scrapstore soon to pick up what I need for the stand tomorrow.

I did the letters on the computer, printed them and cut out templates. Then I found ten different colours for the ten letters in each word, and drew round them with a pencil. Cut those out with nail scissors, and put a backing onto each one with very strong, two sided tape, cutting it to fit the letters exactly. I found a piece of white vinyl just the right size, 5ft 2ins x 1ft 7ins, and hemmed the edges with the sewing machine to strengthen it. This is the finished banner. We don't need eyelets putting in because it is going to be attached to the front of the table. I'm very pleased with how it has turned out, it's very colourful, total cost, zilch.Now I have got to get ready for the sponsored walk tonight. I hope to get an hours shut eye first because I will be walking 13 miles, starting at 10pm.

It's great fun, Becky and I have been visiting businesses to ask if they have anything they are going to throw away, and could we please have it because we can recycle it and make something with it.They have to pay for their rubbish to be taken away, so if we take what we want first it's better for them, less in landfill, and it gets reused for something else. People have been ever so accommodating to our request, they take us on a tour round the factory, show us how the raw materials are turned into the finished product, and we are able to identify any waste that might be usefull to us. Some people tell us they have nothing suitable, but when we look around we usually find something. It's all very interesting and a great excuse for being nosey and asking questions.Today I was removing a lot of vinyl off cuts from a bin when the lorry turned up to empty it. The driver said, 'Carry on, I'll do next doors first', then he wheeled the other bin out. There was a lot of clean wood in it, so I said, 'Wait a minute, I want some of that as well'. He then proceeded to help me fill my car from both bins before he tipped them up into the lorry. It was so funny, and I was filthy with all the dust.I think I have found my forte with this job, it's right up my street. Now I can put everything I learned from 'The Apprentice' into practice.

My weekly grocery spend is only about \u00a312 to \u00a315, so I need to be quite low on food to justify spending \u00a340.I was in Tesco yesterday. A friend and I did a six mile walk to check out the route of the sponsored walk on Friday, we started and finished at Tesco, so I popped in for some fruit. I don't normally wander into the non food section but I noticed a few people rummaging in the discount aisle so nosey me had a peek. Most of it was a good price but not what I needed, but I did see a couple of bargains that I could not resist. Six plastic wash up brushes for 20p, I bought two bundles. A medium size black, backpack for only 50p. I do like backpacks for walking, this was a strong but lightweight one, fantastic bargain I thought.

This one has the seams on the inside, and has eight zips whereas the last one had six and the seams on the outside. I think I like this one better, plenty of room for cash and cards.  I have been trying to think of something else to make with zips, and came up with these pretty wristbands. The top one has a pink ribbon edging with beads added to the stitching, and small coloured buttons sewn onto the zip. I have used velcro for the fastening, it works well but looks a bit messy. The bottom one is edged with red vinyl strips, also stitched on with beads added. The glass crystals down the centre came out of a skip at work, they threw a lot of chandeliers away. I put a press stud on to fasten it, it looks better. Oh, I almost forgot, I made another shopping bag as well, out of the gazebo roof I mentioned before. I made the handles seperately for this one. The panel on the front is a piece of fused plastic bags, I wondered what to do with it, so I sewed it on with the machine with a zigzag stitch.

What starts of as a few potatoes and onions, ends up a massive pile of veg falling off the edge, I just don't know when to stop. This is what I have just eaten.Potatoes, lettuce, and mangetout peas out of the garden. Reduced price out of date tomatoes, sweetcorn out of the freezer, and shop bought onions, all steamed in one pan, except the lettuce of course. Drizzled with Toasted Sesame Seed Oil, scrumptious. This is typical of my meal most nights, for anyone watching their weight you can eat as much of this as you like. I find it no effort at all to keep my weight down because I just love my big plates of veg. Another plus side is that it goes through you pretty quickly, you don't get that bloated feeling...like I did when I had the afternoon tea, definately won't do that very often. Processed food stays in your body far too long, it clogs up your arteries, makes fatty deposits around your organs then they can't function properly. I feel sluggish when I can't get enough veg, feel tired and sick if I eat the wrong things. When I'm on holiday I can't wait to get back and get my normal food, and of course this is a very frugal meal, a win win situation."}, {"title": "Free magazines", "date": "Saturday 27 June 2009", "text": "Twas our village fete today on the green, literally two minutes from my house, very handy.

There is always a book stall there, and last year I found some crafting magazines for 5p each and bought ten. This year they had some more, but this time they were free, so I helped myself to ten, I didn't want to be greedy, so I left some for someone else. I was very pleased with my find, they have lots of craft ideas in them, and patterns to copy. When I got home later, I found a carrier bag on my doorstep full of lots more magazines, how lovely, a very kind gesture indeed. I counted them, another sixty on top of the ten I already have.

I feel the older I get the more precious life becomes, I don't want to waste a minute of it. None of us know how much time we have been alotted or how our health is going to pan out, so I need to replace some of my laid back - no rush - it doesn't matter attitude, with get off your backside and 'DO IT NOW.'Today I fancied going to York. I looked at the bus timetables to see if it would be possible to do the journey on my bus pass. I would need to get a bus to Hull, change, then on to York, the journey would take three hours. Double that for the return, six hours on a bus didn't sound too exciting. I chose the alternative, drive to the outskirts of York to the Park and Ride, time one hour, get a free 20 minute ride into town on the pass, much better. Armed with my free street maps and a packed lunch, I set off to walk around the city along the walls. It is almost complete except for three gaps, two where you cross the river, and one when you walk along the road for a short distance. Some of the sections are quite high and don't have any railings along one side. I did it anticlockwise, so I had the wall on my right and sheer drops on the left down grassy banks and into people's gardens. It was strange walking at the same height as some rooftops and peering into office windows on the same level. People beavering away at their desks, I smiled, look at me, I'm retired :-)I only found one art gallery which was free to go in, all the other tourist attractions had quite a hefty entrance fee, so I decided I was quite happy to look at the outside of the buildings. The river walk was very pleasant, ducks waddling along, people enjoying a drink and an ice cream, tour boats cruising and canoes racing. Here are a few pictures.Mummy and daddy ducks walking their babies, so cute.Tour boat passing under Ouse Bridge going back to it's moorings.The wall passes over the road at this point.View of part of the Minster from the city wall.There is a lot of restoration work going on at the Minster at the moment, so some of it is covered with scaffolding, but I managed to get a few good shots.Street entertainment, singing and dancing. Shambles, the world famous shopping street where the upper floors of the building almost touch each other across the narrow street. This corner shop has the address No 1 Shambles. On the way home I called in to see my friends Janet and Alan at their Breighton Lodge Cattery. Their garden is a blaze of glorious colour at the moment with their hanging baskets, bedding plants, and rose bushes, it looks lovely. As usual I did my tour of inspection I have to say hello to all their pussycats, a full house at this busy time, and also lots of cuddles for their own seven cats. It was lovely to see them again.

I was given two vouchers for my birthday, so I invited my friend Irene to come with me.We were served with posh wholemeal bread triangle sandwiches, no crusts.

I handed my form over with all the questions answered and all the right boxes ticked, and the nice nurse pricked my finger and took a sample. This is put into a test tube full of pinky liquid to see if it sinks within the required time. Oh dear, the beeper went and it hadn't sunk.Then we moved to another table where she stuck a needle in my arm to take a bigger sample, I chuckled as I thought of Tony Hancock all those years ago in that classic comedy, The Blood Donor. The line, 'very nearly an armfull', is so funny. We waited while she did her stuff, and put my blood into a machine, the verdict, oh dear, not enough iron.

Any cat can visit here, other cats just stroll in and out. I went to see Lily's other cat mum round the corner, they don't allow him in the house, that's why he likes it here better.Freddie is the bully, he thinks this is his patch and will see off any others he doesn't like. He arrived about five years ago, in a terrible state, lumps of fur missing, smelly and flea ridden. as an entire male he just had to be 'seen to', but it didn't cure his spraying, unfortunately he still does it, occasionally indoors. I have to have some of the furniture covered, and cleaning solutions at the ready. I still couldn't get rid of him though, even with his bad habits. Not sure how old he is, probably quite old.

I punched the outline of a hole in the corner with one of those gadgets which makes holes in leather. It wouldn't go right through so I carefully prodded the outline with the point of a sharp craft knife untill it came out. Using the same method with the barclaycard, I cut a flower shape into it.

The best way to approach this was to knock on doors, and ask if we could rummage through their rubbish, and we found people very helpfull, they wanted us to take stuff, to help cut their costs of sending it to landfill. This particular bin was full of vinyl offcuts, the company makes curtain sides for lorries and trailers, they are made to measure so they will always have an excess. The pieces were varying sizes, and all colours, I'm sure we will find a use for them.Another company is going to deliver some stuff to us, because we don't have a van, and someone else is going to save their broken tiles for us to make mosaics with. There is so much stuff going to landfill that shouldn't be, what we need are a lot more people to be creative and find new uses for these materials.

The bus pass comes in handy for free travel, but today I had the fancy of going to Holmfirth, home of 'Last of the Summer Wine', so it was the car, as it would have taken all day to get there on the bus. Seventy miles and one and a half hours, later I arrived at 11.30am. What a picturesque place it is, nestled in the valley just south of Huddersfield, exactly as you see it on the tele.I thought Sid's Cafe would be a good place to start, there was Compo waiting for me. Sorry to say, I didn't go in, I sat on the bench outside the church opposite, and ate my sandwiches. Just outside is the starting point for the tour bus, and luckily it came along just as the rain came down. I got front seat for a good view and paid my \u00a36. For fortyfive minutes we were taken up and down the narrow lanes, the driver did a comentary and told us some of the filming secrets. Everyone thinks all the houses in the programme are in the same village, but they are not. They are in several villages dotted around Holmfirth. When all the trucks come with all the equipment they are parked in a large park, and the actors and props have to be ferried around in small vehicles due to the width restrictions of the roads. Also some of the scenes are shot in the studios. Aunty Wainrights junk shop doesn't exist, it is a house made to look like a shop, and the cafe has to be changed to make the counter on the left hand side, but in reality it is only a wall. The scenes showing Ivy going into the kitchen are shot in the studios because there is no kitchen behind the counter. When we got back the rain had stopped and the sun came out, what luck! I set off for a walk up into the hills, I wanted to be high up and admire the views. The Ordnance Survey map was very useful, I did a circular walk following the footpaths. Here are a couple photo's. When you are in Holmfirth you have to go and see Nora Batty's cottage. Remember the railings around the balcony by the front door, well the the balcony is not very wide, so for filming they have to build an extension, like a wooden platform so everything can fit on it. Also they never show the top story of the building, in the programme it is a one up one down cottage, in reality it has three floors. The people living in Holmfirth must be very fit, it is full of steep and narrow streets, some of which you can't take a car down. The only thing that spoils it is all the traffic going through it, it's a pity they don't have a bypass, but I am not sure where they could put one without blowing up millions of tons of rocks and destroying the beauty of the place."}, {"title": "I love books", "date": "Tuesday 9 June 2009", "text": "I'm going to be doing some house sitting soon, and looking after a dog while the owners go away.

The trade stands leave their piles of junk lying around and I can't resist rooting through them to see what can be salvaged.The other day I got it out of my garage, spread it out on the ground, and cut it up into massive blue and white triangles, discarding all the seams. Although it was in quite good condition, hardly used, I scrubbed a blue piece with soapy water and hung it up to dry. It cleaned up nicely, now what can I make with it? I tested a small piece to see if it would go through my new sewing machine without breaking a needle, and if the stitching would be strong enough to hold a bag together without tearing. It looked fine to me. Next get a carrier bag to use as a pattern, lay it out on the floor and cut round it. A bit of decoration would be nice. I used a stencil to cut some letters out of the vinyl offcuts I have, and stitched these on first. Then sew up the sides, and make a fold in the bottom to give it some width, copying the plastic bag. Next I cut two pieces matching the shape of the handles and stitched them to the inside of the bag to reinforce them. Here is my bag, I know the letters are higgledy piggledy, and the sewing is not perfect, but I think this adds to the fun of the bag.

I'm still thinking of ideas for the thousand zips we have at the Scrapstore, though I don't think I will be making any more of these.Take eight, 4inch yellow zips, sew them all together with running stitch with contrasting thread, seams on the outside, all the same way up. Then you have to close the gaps at each end of the zips by sewing them together neatly on the inside with same colour thread. Very fiddly, makes your fingers sore, I used a pair of pointy pliers to pull the needle through the tough edges of the zips. Get an empty tin can, washed out, cut two circles of fabric, and one oblong piece for the inner lining.Sew one circle to the zips for the bottom, seam inside. Sew up the side seam on the oblong piece, then sew that to the other end of the zips. You have to put the zip tube inside the lining tube, so the seam is on the inside. Pin it in place and sew.Now you have a long tube, turn it the right way round, then put the can into the tube. This is where I came unstuck. I thought I had measured it to fit snugly over the can, but my stitching round the top edge was a bit too tight, which made it a fraction too small for the can. I tried for ages to get the can inside.Admitting defeat, I did not want to unpick it and sew it up again more loosely, so I used an aluminium drinks can which is slightly smaller, cut the top off. Because the can is now a lot lighter, the zips make it top heavy, so I found some washers in my bit box and stuck them in the recess in the bottom to weight it down.Now the lining is too loose so I put four vertical darts in it, then stitched the inner circle on. I'm still not 100% happy with it, because the zips should have been a tighter fit around the can, but it will do as an example at the Scrapstore, maybe give people ideas.

I've also been trying to sew pieces on to the fabric, not sure what you call it, blimey, that's not as easy as it looks, going round corners is difficult. I definately need more practice. I was worried that the machine might go too fast and run away with me, but I have rectified that by using a naked right foot on the pedal.It will take me a while to get used to it, it's nothing like the old fashioned treadle machine I used as a teenager, but it will be interesting to try out all the functions. Don't hold your breath for some masterpiece to appear just yet, while the sun's shining I will be outside, the sewing will fit in nicely on rainy days."}, {"title": "Free day out in Hull", "date": "Thursday 28 May 2009", "text": "I used my bus pass again today, to go to Hull. It's real name is Kingston upon Hull, so much nicer than just Hull. The bus station is massive, and so organised, buses coming and going every few seconds, it's a hive of activity. I went into the ticket and information office and gathered all the timetables which I thought might be usefull for my research on days out. Then I went walkabout, armed with my map and tourist guide book. As it is school half term there was a lot going on, continental food market, craft fair, childrens entertainment, and street performers. I took a few photo's.The Deep, one of the deepest and most spectacular aquariums in the world. I didn't go inside, maybe next time when I get a free ticket with my Tesco vouchers.A polar bear in the Mariners Museum.  The Marina.Street entertainment.  This bus is as old as me, built in 1949 Streetlife - The Museum of Transport  Monument of Ghandi in the Wilberforce GardenAnother frugal day out, I took my sandwiches and a drink, and didn't spend any money apart from \u00a34.36 at Tesco. Well I had to get my reduced price bargains, didn't I, as the store was next to the Bus Station. I will have to go back to Hull again, there is such a lot more to see.

I spread them out on my dining room table, and pondered, usually you sew them onto fabric to open and close something. Thinking outside the box, why not sew them together. My first thought was a handbag, but as the zipper part is quite thick, the bag was going to be very heavy, what about a purse, it might just work. I picked out six zips in two colurs.Next, what to sew them together with? It will have to be strong because the purse will get a lot of rough handling and it will have to be robust enough to withstand a lot of pulling around. I have a reel of thin string, just the job. I decided to make the seams on the outside so the stitching shows up, and it will be easier to assemble. Here is the finished article, it measures 13cm x 9cm, and you can open it using any zip, quite a handy little purse.

As I lifted them out I found they came with plants that are definately not past the sell by date.I repotted them and now they stand on display in my front garden, I wonder if anyone will recognise them, ha ha.

Also two cucumber plants fit nicely. Last year I tried courgettes, one plant in each box. They grew alright and I had quite a few fruits off them, but they weren't as productive as those in the raised beds. I ended up with six extra runner bean plants last year, so I put them in a box with their canes.

Here is part of my collection of drinks cups, yoghurt pots, plastic food cartons, and flower pots.

I arranged to meet up with some 'Down The Laners' from the Forum I am a moderator on, see right for link. Checking over the timetables, I picked out a bus that would get me into Lincoln at 10.30am. I wanted to do the whole journey on the bus but unfortunately the last bus back to my village leaves before the Lincoln bus gets in, so the only option was to drive the four miles to town.I felt in a cheerfull mood as I got on the bus, and chatted to the driver a few minutes before we set off. I bet he thought I was a bit dotty, but I don't care, I love to make people laugh, no point in being miserable. An elderly gentleman got on and we chatted all the way to Gainsborough, which helped to divert attention from being bumped around a lot. I have decided buses are no good for anyone with a bad back, you would need crutches by the time you get off :-)I met Wilma at the Bus Station in Lincoln, she came in on the Grimsby bus. It's a good job I told her to look for red hair, specs and shoulder bag, because I had accidentaly deleted her phone number when I cleared out my message box on the forum. A senior moment, I think! We had a good look round the museums and galleries, a walk up Steep Hill past the Castle and Cathedral. I love the little antique and gift shops, there was a mini craft fair in the street, me snooping for ideas again. I had a chat with a woman who did felting, quite amazing how it is done, and she had some lovely bags, necklaces and bracelets.  At 1pm we met two more Laners at the Museum of Lincolnshire Life, Silky and Mallard were waiting in the cafe for us. After chatting for an hour me and Wilma had a look round the museum, I took some pictures. I love the old fashioned rooms in a house they set up, and the shops, can just imagine how they looked with people in them.   Wilma got the 3.45pm bus back and I got the 4.15pm, All in all, a good day out, and it only cost the price of a drink, a toasted teacake, and an ice cream.

Does it go faster as you get older? I went to the Scrapstore this morning to meet up with some like minded people who are passionate about recycling. There hasn't been much happening there for a while because of a lack of, 'can do', volunteers. Lorraine and Phil soldier on, but it's an uphill struggle when some committee members seem to exist in name only.I personally think it is almost impossible to get a good active committee working together in complete harmony. From my experiences there will always be one or two dedicated members, and the rest just make the right sounding noises. I'm not saying that's happening here, because I am the new girl, but it's my perception of all committees.I started the Lady Truckers Club and ran it single handed for seven years, I built it up to over 350 members, and that was before computers, a lot of hand written work was needed. Then they wanted a committe, so that's what they got. It worked for a while but just as I predicted it fizzled out, very difficult to keep it going on a national level. Still, it had served it's purpose, a support network for women in transport, I like to think I did my bit for the cause.Anyway, back to the Scrapstore. It seems we have a little band of willing helpers which might work ok because we are all in the same area. We have a plan of action, we need more people through the door, and we need to collect more scrap. Our agenda has been recorded in our minutes book and hopefully things might happen.I came away with some scrap to play with, lots of zips, offcuts of vinyl and leather, coloured buttons, plastic bottles, and....metal hooks, don't ask, I am going to have to play with them for some inspiration.

I got the 10.35 into town, the driver glanced at my plastic card and handed me a ticket. Now where shall I sit to get the best view out of the window? The seats towards the rear were higher so I chose third from the back, thinking the further back you go the bumpier the ride will be. I remember riding on buses when I was a child, mums with buggy's had a terrible job of getting in and out of them. It's not like that now, the step is low so the buggy can be wheeled on, and plenty of room for baby to stay in the buggy. It was a bit hot so I opened a window, this will be a good way to keep warm when winter comes along, riding around all day on buses, ha ha. We pulled into the bus station at 10.50, so it's only a couple of minutes longer than in the car. I imagined I was a tourist and headed towards the museum on Oswald Road. I could have got another bus but decided to walk. I've never been inside before, all very interestingNext I went to the 20 21 Arts Centre, I love this place,the exhibitions are very inspiring. The building is an old church with a modern extension to it, it works very well. You will see the Free Admission sign on the glass front. I can get lost in arty and crafty things, and I always want to sing when I am inside the churchy bit.Time to sit on a bench in the sun and eat my sandwiches, and watch the world go by. To finish off I went to my regular haunt, the library, and spent an hour reading the newspapers and magazines.

I'm holding my bus pass :-)By the way, I had the most fabulous present from Carol, there's a big hamper in there packed with lots of lovely things to eat, bought from all the best shops. Carol often frequents Marks and Sparks for her food, in total contrast to my bargain hunting, so she had the good idea to get me some posh nosh. Now that's what I call a really usefull present.Sadly Carol is now on her way back to Hampshire, we have been friends for 50 years, although we don't see each other that often we know the other is always going to be there, surely the best kind of friend to have."}, {"title": "Today is my birthday", "date": "Saturday 16 May 2009", "text": "Today is my birthday, not too much of a hangover from last night I'm glad to say, managed to curb my drinking a little, wouldn't want to spend my big day in bed. After a short dog walk with Ben so that I could show Carol around my village, we set off after lunch and arrived at Bransby Horses about 3pm. Carol, who lives in Hampshire, adopts a horse every year so I thought it would be a good opportunity for her to see the place. Unfortunately she couldn't visit her current horse because he has had an operation recently, he was kicked by another horse and had to have his jaw wired up. He is in quarantine because he has been away from the centre, this is to prevent any strangles being passed on. I handed over the money raised, which they were very pleased with then we went a walkabout to see the horses.On the way to Retford we stopped off at a lovely pub for a meal before our night at the theatre. I can highly recommend the Whitehouses Inn at London Road, Retford. I opted for a home made nut roast in a scrummy sauce with fresh spinach, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower and boiled potatoes, it was perfect.The show was a Rock-n-Roll music show, performed by Black Cat and the Blackettes. They performed songs from Connie Francis, Bill Haley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, and Brenda Lee. I love that music, just can't stop my feet tapping. Pity I was stuck in the middle of the row or I would have got up and danced. Guess what, Carol had arranged for them to announce my birthday, so I had to stand up and reveal myself, in fact I was smiling and waving to everyone, I was so happy.

As I turned the corner into my street, my best friend Carol is sitting outside the house in her car, having arrived five minutes before, good timing.Some catching up to do with the gossip, then we went round to the club to decorate the party room. Luckily I have been given all the banners and glittery bits by two friends who have also turned sixty in the last couple of months, when I have finished with it I shall pass it on to someone else. Room done, we were invited for a drink in the bar with Mad Mick, can't get plastered yet, we've got all the food to prepare.The next three hours were spent in my kitchen up to our eyeballs in bread, salad, nibbles, assembling it all into some kind of respectable buffet, with the help of a glass or two of Chardonnay. Of course I tried to make it as frugal as I could, margarine tubs came in handy for the reduced price crisps :-) We delivered the food to the club and then came home to change.Mandy the DJ was great, I had asked for all sixties music and that is what she played. Everyone was given a free raffle ticket and I donated some stock I had left over from a closed business, so that was a bit of fun. Tina Turner, aka Carol, put in an appearance later, the wig, black tights, what a scream she was, Simply the Best will never be the same again. I had asked for no presents, because I have everything I need, and I hate to see people waste money on stuff to fill my drawers. Instead I said if anyone wanted to make a donation, I would give it to an animal charity. I chose Monkey World in Dorset, and Bransby Home for Horses near Lincoln.

I've been reading up about it, apparently the peninsula is breached every 250 years, the sea cuts across it permanently and all beyond the breach is swept away and will reform again over the years, repositioning itself slightly to the west and pointing further south. Here is a link to an arial photograph.http://www.spurnpoint.com/SPURN%204.jpgSpurn Point is 3.5 miles long and 50 yards wide in places, it has been owned by the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust since 1960, and the sea defences built by the Victorians are now crumbling. There is a life boat station which is the only one in the country with full time paid staff. There are seven men and their families who live in RNLI houses, 29 people in total, they work seven days a week and must be on call so can't go anywhere. The wives have to do all the running around, shopping, getting the car fixed, etc, and the children get the school bus every morning. The jetty also has the Humber pilots working from it, these boats guide the big ships in and out of the narrow and treacherous shipping lanes of the Humber. This is my photograph of the jetty. It's a nice day today so I set off at 10am, over the Humber Bridge, and through Hull. When I get my bus pass I'm going to have some days out here then I won't have to pay the bridge toll, it's \u00a32.70 at the moment. I kept on going through a lot of villages, on the A1073 then the B1445. You can park for free before you go onto the peninsula, and walk the three and a half miles to the point, I decided to drive almost to the end, and pay the \u00a33 parking, because I wanted make sure I had enough energy to do some exploring as well as some beach combing. It was very windy as I walked towards the point, the tide was out so I went down onto the beach, it was like being in a sand storm, thank goodness my back was towards the wind or I would never have been able to open my eyes. I walked along the North Sea side of it for a while then went up onto the sand dunes. There was squillions of brown caterpillars everywhere. These are from the brown tail moth, a notice said not to touch them because their small barbed hairs may cause irritation, often developing into a rash. I decided to sit down in a sheltered spot to eat my lunch but wasn't there very long, I jumped up when I noticed some furry little bodies climbing over my boots and scurrying up my trouser legs, thankfully on the outside. The caterpillars were everywhere, in the grasses, blowing across the beach, getting squashed on the road. Another reason I wanted to visit Spurn is that we have an exhibition at the Arts Centre in Scunthorpe at the moment, of thousands of pieces of plastic picked up from the beaches, by artist Martin Waters. If you look at his web site there are pictures of it on the Installations page, the six big coloured panels, they are pretty impressive.http://www.martin-waters.co.uk/On the way home I went a slightly different route, to drive past the wind farm at Holmpton, the seven turbines were spinning in the wind. I stopped off at Withernsea and had a lovely fish and chip tea. This is a small seaside town with a few amusement arcades, I took a walk down the promenade before I left to come home. I really enjoyed my day out."}, {"title": "The modern charity shop", "date": "Thursday 7 May 2009", "text": "I'm in a bit of a quandary, this morning I was in town looking in the charity shops for something to wear at my party in 8 days time, I am determined it won't cost much money. I am quite drawn towards the 'Sue Pollard' look, bright, bizarre, and cheerful, my aim is to make people smile in admiration, or fall about laughing. I searched all seven charity shops and found one item, this lovely shiny, crumpled look top, in shades of yellow, orange, copper, gold, red, and green, it fits me just right a bargain at \u00a32.50Then I started looking for something to wear with it and shock horror ! I started looking in the mainstream clothes shops, and I found some of the prices were almost as low as the charity shops. Now this may be that the charity shops are putting their prices up. At one time you could guarantee that their prices were rock bottom, but now you have to search the sale rails for any bargains.I went back for a second look at the British Heart Foundation shop, they were busy earlier because they have just had a refit and everyone was crowding in to see their brand spanking new shop. Just as I was browsing the rails it struck me that they have spent a lot of money, everything looked perfect, even down to all the coathangers being the same good quality wooden ones. The press arrived from the local paper, and I stood earwigging as they interviewed a very smartly dressed young chappie, obviously from the regional or even national headquarters, you never see someone like him helping out on a day to day basis. Of course he was singing the praises of his shop. I suddenly became reluctant to buy anything, for a start it looked like a proper shop, the prices were slightly higher than you would expect, probably to pay for the refit, and it lacked the homely, friendly, thrown together feeling. It's far too posh for me.Now my quandry, should I stick to my principles of buying as much second hand as I can, or should I say sod it, I might as well buy new and cheap if the charity shops are going to spend all my money on expensive refits? Don't know what to do now!"}, {"title": "Life is learning", "date": "Wednesday 6 May 2009", "text": "I've had a lovely day out today, courtesy of North Lindsey College, another free course. So far this year I have done Introduction to Psychology - ten weeks, Introduction to Social Sciences - ten weeks, Running an Event - one day, and today was Introduction to Life Coaching. I am also part way through another ten week course, this time Health Psychology.None of these have exams or qualifications, they are taster courses that people can attend if they are not sure whether they want to sign up for the real course or not. If I was about twenty years younger I might seriously consider going down the Life Coach route, but for now the subject will remain just an interest.I love learning about life, I think I have mine pretty much sorted so I am lucky. Others are not so lucky. When I was young I didn't think I was worth very much, I had very little confidence, but things changed when I realised that I had choices, at the first opportunity I left home to stand on my own two feet. I could live where I wanted to live, I could do the job I wanted to do, I loved my freedom and independance.I have just re-read the above, I said I am lucky, let me re-phrase that. I am lucky because I thought about my life, about how I wanted it to be, and about which direction I wanted to go. I thought about the decisions I needed to make, and the changes I could make if I was not happy about something. So maybe I shouldn't say I am lucky, because it was all planned. There is one quote that keeps coming back to me, and I don't know who said it, 'If you don't have a plan for the rest of your life, someone else does.' How true.Of course I called in Tesco as I was passing on the way home, and was chuffed to find some bargains. Alpen luxury oat flakes and clusters reduced from \u00a32.93 to 20p. Capri 5 pouch fruit drinks from \u00a31.80 to 30p. Choc soya drink from 79p to 10p. Potatoes 2.5kg \u00a31.97 to 49p. Big bag posh crisps \u00a31.55 to 20p. Big spiced fruit loaf \u00a31.76 to 50p.

I wonder if they try and baffle us, for instance a pile of stones looks like a pile of stones to me, but the artist sees it differently. I occasionally come away with the notion that maybe I could do something like that. I decided to have a go, my raw materials cost virtually nothing, start with an empty cat food box.Paint it yellow, three coats of emulsion from a small sample pot I bought from Woolies for 4p, don't need to paint the back. Collect bits and bobs, plastic bottles, cd, drinks cans, vinyl scraps, curly electrical wire, (I used to have a job making headphones and saved all the offcuts), piece of cord, bits of christmas decorations, nail varnish, and fine wire from the inside of an old video player I dissected. Cut a flap in the back of the box and attach all the bits with the fine wire. And this is the result, a picture to hang on the wall. I have entitled it MY FACEWhen I started it I didn't know how it was going to finish up, I had no idea it was going to be a face. I stuck the cord on first with lilac paint. The ears, nose, and mouth is cut from a cd and painted with nail varnish. I boiled the cd for a few minutes to see what would happen to it, the two layers fell apart which made it thin enough to cut with scissors. There is a real earring through the nose. Drinks cans cut with curly scissors, mix the colours. The eyes are blue vinyl, unpainted cd bits, plastics cut from shampoo bottles, and the eyelashes are cut from a decoration you stick on a gift. The hair is the curly electrical wire, and earrings are christmas decorations. On the bottom left hand corner I have put my blood donors badge.

My fault for trying to get a few more walks out of an old pair of boots, I think it's time I binned them. I came across my ordnance survey map the other day, a well worn map I might add as I have walked most of the footpaths in my area. There's nothing I enjoy more than planning a route on a map and discovering the footpaths on the ground. I've never been on a map reading course, but I imagine it would be quite interesting, you can keep your sat nav's, give me a map any day.This morning was lovely so I set off up Tee Lane and turned right at the water tower down a track. Heading towards Coleby around the edge of the fields I came across a bench, in the middle of nowhere in particular, strange place to put a bench, I thought. Someone had tied a bouquet of flowers to the tree next to it, I read the card, it said, 'Forever yours'. How kind of someone to put a bench here so people can sit awhile and enjoy the solitude of the countryside. Of course the bench was placed there in memory of a loved one, someone who probably walked that path many times. I carried on through Colby and across the fields to Alkborough. I have mentioned this place before. The sign at the entrance to the village has a picture of St Julian's Bower, a maze cut into the turf. I joined the hill top to return home high above the River Trent. I love it up here. By this time my blister was starting to make me limp, but I hobbled on. The seven mile walk took me two and threequarter hours to complete.

I don't watch the programme but was prompted to take a look at her performance on youtube, or is it utube, by all the media hype about it. I was mesmerised by the sound that came out of her mouth, a beautiful voice so full of warmth and charm. And the look on the faces of those who were gobsmacked that such a plain woman could produce an enchanting sound, it brought tears to my eyes.I watched it several times, and each time feeling the same emotion as I felt the first time. What made me smile was the fact that no one expected her to be able to sing a note in tune, well she showed them didn't she?And again, while watching the Apprentice this week, Lorainne, one of the contestants, and no beauty, was ignored and ridiculed yet again by her fellow contestants. No one listened to her when she had made a perfectly valid point, that the carpet they had to sell was probably worth a lot of money. During the time in the boardroom. Margaret, Alan Sugar's assistant, came to her rescue and said she was a Cassandra. I admit that I didn't know what she meant, Margaret explained and I looked it up in the dictionary. Cassandra....You know the answer but no one listens, prophecies of doom are unheeded. Lorraine knew that the carpet shouldn't be sold for such a fraction of what it was worth, but no one listened.I can relate to the struggles these women are encountering, because I am not a beauty either, and I had to fight for years to be taken seriously, to be listened to, and to be accepted as an HGV driver. I believe it was because of my looks. Plain women don't feature on the front cover of a magazine, they are overlooked when applying for work, they do get passed by for promotion, sales assistants do ignore you in a shop, and people push past you in a queue. It's as if you are invisible.Sorry if you think this topic a bit serious for my normally jolly blog, but it's been on my mind. I shall be willing Susan to win Britains Got Talent and meet the queen, and Lorraine to win The Apprentice and get her dream job with Sir Alan.

I had a computer expert here this morning gasping in amazement at how it was infected with every imaginable bug. I watched as he zapped through the lot, cleaned it all up with his little stick, put a new anti everything programme in it, then he left me to watch it scan for over an hour and a half.

Well, I have actually been to work. Last year I did a few jobs for Timberland Motorhomes, collecting and delivering them to and from shows. This weekend they had about 50 at Peterborough, they rang and asked if I was available, so 15 of us went in a mini bus to bring them all back. I call this my hobby job, as it's more like a day out, the guys are good to work with, we have a laugh, and I get to drive some really smart top of the range motorhomes. I was pleased to see they had bought us a brand new mini bus. Previously we had a basic school bus type box on wheels and the seats were awful, I always had to take a cushion it was so uncomfortable. It seems the sales of motorhomes have not been hit by the recession, possibly more people are electing to do their own thing rather than fly off abroad somewhere. Some of the interiors are luxurious, I can picture myself touring around in one of these, but at almost \u00a340,000 for a newish small one, or \u00a360,000 for the deluxe with garage, I think it will have to remain, 'in my dreams.' It's countdown time to my party, the guest list is growing, I need to plan the buffet, and decide what I am to wear. I have decided not to look like a conventional 60 year old, but to look like a bright and crazy chic, so I have been scouring the charity shops for something totally outrageous, can't wait to see the gobsmacked look on everyone's face. I am going to cease puttting my daily spend on here for the time being. I have been doing it because I thought it might give inspiration to others and illustrate that it it possible to live on very little money. I will make a mention of the bargains I get from time to time, just as a reminder that I am keeping to my strict rules of searching out the best that I can get for my money.

This is the life for my friends Janet and Alan, who have a cattery near Selby in North Yorkshire, I love to visit them and enjoy the tranquility of their place, it's 45 minutes drive away and I arrived just after 2pm.After catching up on our news in the conservatory, I went for a stroll around the gardens and to see the cats in their chalet's. Janet is like a mother to them, checking and playing with them, making sure they are not getting too homesick. She has seven of her own as well, but all the cats get her equal attention.I noticed that the stepping stones across the lawn were disappearing underneath the grass and the tidying instinct in me kicked in, I asked her for a sharp knife and a bucket. I like to do a job where you can see a difference, here are the before and after pictures.  Janets helper, Laura, turned up at tea time and they proceeded to serve the guests their evening meal, then there was some pruning to do around the bushes which Janet got on with while Alan set to in the kitchen to make us all a meal. Afterwards there was time for me to trim round the edges of the lawn with the long handled shears, once I start a job like that I have to keep going untill it's finished. I ran out of time and had to give up as darkness approached. I could quite happily go back there tomorrow and find lots more to get on with, I enjoy working in other people's gardens.Now just to re-cap on what I said at the beginning. It is nice to live and work at your own business, but Janet is on the go all the time, there is a lot of work to do in a cattery, she has had two days off in the last eighteen months. The gardens need constant attention, they have just painted the exterior of the house, Alan has cleared the pond out, sealed the bottom and got it working again three ponds with cascading water. Alan is also a cat photographer and has made their own signs, and he makes signs for other people, also prints business cards, and of course cats are coming and going all the time.

You know how you know straight away, when you meet someone for the first time, that you are going to get on with them, well it was like that. We both couldn't stop talking, we had quite a lot in common, both being unemployed and heading towards retirement, enduring similar experiences at the job centre.I felt we had been mates for ages, so I gave him an invite to my party next month.

I have never skipped breakfast, even then. Most drivers starting at that time would grab a cup of coffee and a cigarette, and make a stop at around 10am when they pulled into a transport cafe and filled up with a full fried breakfast. You've only got to look around you to see retired truck drivers struggling with excess baggage and wheezing like they have just run a marathon, which none of them could ever hope to do.So, without trying to sound too preachy, a good start to every day is very important. This is how I do it. I have an assortment of seeds and nuts, which I vary from day to day. I try and include sesame seeds, linseeds, and pumpkin seeds every day, with any nuts, walnuts, almonds, cashew nuts, brazil nuts, and pecans. These I crush with a pestle and mortar, and add to my cereal. I don't like packets of ready made muesli because there is too much sugar and salt in them. I have either bran flakes, oat bran, or porridge oats. Sometimes I will cut a banana up on top, or mix some dried fruit into it, then I pour soya milk over it. I never seem to have problems with my digestive system or my waste disposal, so I think this diet is right for me. It's a matter of trying different ingredients to suit yourself.

No one seems to be able to catch them at it though. I have flattened the ramps, and I know other people have as well. A few years ago when I moved to the area there was only one path through the woods, now there are dozens. It seems such a shame that our young people are intent on destroying everything.

They didn't give me a grilling, just told me a bit about what would be expected of me, and asked me a few questions.They asked me if I had any previous experience in this type of work (catering) and I delved into the depths of my memory to recall my job of working in a cafeteria on Blackpool Promenade in 1967.

The hairdresser at the next chair also joined in, as did her customer who was getting her hair blowed dried. It goes against the grain a bit for me to go into a salon and pay to have my haircut, but on this occasion I think it was well worth the seven pounds, to pass a pleasant half hour with such nice people.

If you want to try it protect your iron by sandwiching the plastic between two pieces of paper, I used brown baking paper, which incidentally also doubles up as tracing paper. The iron needs to be on a medium setting and it's best if you iron both sides. I used eight layers of bags.The pieces went a bit wavy because I swept the iron from side to side, I now know you have to also go up and down and round in circles to get a flatter more square piece. You can trim the edges if it is the wrong shape.For this I used a charity sack, only the white part with no lettering, then I added some other coloured pieces. Fresh and simple comes from a bag of spuds, but you can also use bread bags.This is a bigger piece, I added different colours, and types of plastic. The cats heads did not stick well as they were thicker. Also the eight layers did not bond too well because of the size, it needs more ironing along the edges, or reduce the size, smaller pieces are easier to work with.I have yet to work out what to use them for, the finished piece is very strong and could be stitched together, they could also be welded together with more heat.

I set off to walk back home, a distance of about seven miles. As I was passing a young man waiting at a bus stop, he yelled across the road to me, I couldn't hear him properly so I walked towards him. He repeated himself, 'Have you got your boys pants on?' A big grin spread across his face. Anyone overhearing that may have thought he was being abusive, but I stopped to chat, a great conversation ice breaker I thought. Of course he was referring to my appearance in the television programme, Hunt for Britains Tightest Person, I'm amazed that people still remember it, and recognise me. I am shocked at how much booze people drink at home, me being a bit nosey, I look in the recycled boxes which are awaiting collection outside people's houses.

My specs have been the cause of most of my insecurities, my shyness, and at times my total lack of confidence and self esteem.It all started when I was eight years old, I couldn't understand why I didn't know the words of the hymms we had to sing in assembly at school. I thought we had to learn them and I couldn't remember them all because there were so many. I told my mum so she took me for an eye test, it was then that I found out that the others were not learning the words, they were reading them from a big chart on the wall, and I couldn't see them. Of course when I got my new national health specs I became a target for name calling, which I had to endure untill I left school. We couldn't afford the newer nicer frames that were becoming available. It was one of the first things I saved up for when I started my first job, I was determined to ditch those horrible monstrosities that had given me so much grief. All through my teenage years I hated my specs, I would immediately whip them off when someone came near me with a camera. The taunts then were 'Boys don't make passes at girls in glasses', which was certainly true in my case. I tried to manage without them and put them in my handbag when I went out. Of course I had to give up and put them on when I couldn't see who I was talking to. Anyway, I finally had some respite when I reached my mid twenties, it was my brother I had to thank, because he came out with the statement, 'You look bloody awfull, why don't you get some contact lenses?' Although the remark was very hurtfull, I looked in the mirror and thought, he's right, I do look bloody awful. My confidence soared when I got my lenses, it was like a miracle, at last I was like most other people. I didn't have to look through a window to see the world, people didn't know my eyesight was so bad, I now looked normal. I had a lot of years of happiness with my contact lenses. Now they have have gone because I need reading glasses, and it seems silly to wear lenses and put reading specs on top, so I have changed to varifocals. Technology has moved on a lot now, and I no longer need to suffer with my bottle bottoms, I can have ultra thin lenses giving me a much wider choice of frames. So, today I have been to Specsavers to have an eye test and order my new specs. At this point I have to say a big thankyou to the super young lady assistant, Jo, who helped me chose the frames, she has the patience of a saint. It wasn't easy, I was in the shop for three and a half hours, and this is what I have chosen. Thank goodness I won't have to do that again for a few more years.

I took the bags, some cards, beads, and pen holders, they were fascinated by them. I explained how I had made them, they thought the knitted bags were fantastic, and asked me to how to turn plastic bags into yarn. I think they want to have a try at making some themselves.I went on to tell them about my simple lifestyle. Now some of these ladies could probably tell me a thing or two about frugality, but I'm sure they were a bit surprised at my extreme money saving ideas. There were roars of laughter when I confessed I use my urine as fertiliser on my compost heap, and no, I didn't go down the bottom of the garden and drop my drawers!They were a bit unsure whether to believe me when I told them about my habit of using the same pan for cooking two or three meals, and the same dish for my bran flakes three days on the trot, to cut down on the washing up. They thought I was kidding.I think some of the ladies actually saw the logic in what I was saying when I explained some of my less extreme ways of saving money, I noticed they nodded in agreement.

Just look at this 'butter wouldn't melt in his mouth' face, I can assure you it would! He has been full of energy for almost the whole time, from when I picked him up at 9.15am, to when I left him locked safely in his house at 9.45pm.On arriving here I took him a short walk and he had a pooooo on my friends lawn, good job she wasn't in. Then I gave him some breakfast. I thought he might settle for a sleep so I put a sleeping bag on the floor for him. No such luck. I tried to read a book but Henry had other ideas, like wouldn't it be fun to jump on me and rip the sleeves out of my sweatshirt. I thought my best defence was to stand up, then I got a bit of peace, but he was sad that I no longer wanted to play.My cats had scattered, two of them made for the garden, and the third took refuge on the window sill in the bedroom. It was essential to keep doors closed between them as I didn't want to take Henry home with a bloody nose. Freddie is no coward where defending his territory is concerned. I managed to get myself some lunch, which was eaten at the table with Henry sitting next to me, his nose resting a few inches from my plate. No mate, that sad look in your eyes does not wash with me, sorry, this is mine. I rang Sue, my friend, to see if she would come and help me walk both Ben and Henry together, because I was also looking after him as well. She came round at 1pm and we collected Ben from his house. It was a gloriously sunny day so we walked to the new allotments to see what progress is being made. I decided not to let either dog off the lead, even though it is rare to see Ben with his on, he is such a placid old man. Back at my house, after taking Ben to his, Henry eventually fell asleep, ah pure bliss, twenty minutes of calm. Not for long though, he thinks it is a good idea to rip my carpet up, and finds a loose wooden batten in the corner, it's in his mouth and I have to retrieve it. By 6.30pm I thought the best option was to take him back to his home and stay with him untill he settles, he might calm down in his own familiar surroundings. Surprisingly he is very good at car travel, happy in his harness, and dozes on the back seat. I left at 9.45pm, Henry is sprawled out in his bed, after a particularly vicious attack on it, his toys scattered the length of the kitchen. He looks so innocent.My day was still not finished, I had to take Ben for his last walk before bed time, he is staying with me for three nights and is not a bit of trouble.

Although there are a million sites on the net, with everything you need to know, I still like having a book in front of me to browse through when I have a spare minute. I picked up a couple from the mobile library the other day.Patrick Holford is one of the worlds leading nutrition experts, so it says on the back cover of 'The Holford 9-day Liver Detox', I have read his books before and found them easy to understand, no blinding you with science. I am quite tempted to try this 9 day plan, and looking through the lists of what to eat and what not to eat, I don't think I will find it too difficult because I already eat a lot of seeds, nuts, fruit and vegetables. The only problems I might encounter are giving up my morning coffee and branflakes, but it does say you could possibly do it if you limit your coffee to one cup per day, so maybe I could just have a smaller cup.His other book I have chosen is called 'Food is Better Medicine Than Drugs'. I am not into herbal medicine, and I rarely take any kind of medicine, I believe you are a product of what you eat, and everything that goes into your mouth is going to have an effect on how your body works, or doesn't work.I am going to study these two books over the next six weeks, and hopefully get a few ideas on how I can improve my diet. Of course this will have to be done within the confines of my budget. People say you can't eat healthily on little money. I am going to have to search in many more places to find my food, because I think it is an excuse to say 'I can't afford to eat healthy food.'I may not be able to start the detox immediately, because I have to eat the food I already have, is that an excuse? No not really, I can't be wastefull and throw food away. But I can start by tweaking, and gradually phasing out the stuff I shouldn't be eating, and phasing in the good food. As I am getting older, I am becoming more aware of how little time there is left, I would like another twenty years. Before my operation last year my consultant said I would have another forty years after it was done.

First I had to strip off the old plastic by removing all the battens, I bought the plastic sheeting from a car boor sale, a massive roll for \u00a33.50, it has lasted well. Then I covered the sides with shrink wrap, the sort they use in warehouses to wrap palletised goods. I wrapped it round and round loads of times, then I put the roof on, a double sheet from the roll, and battened it down. Next I put more shrink wrap on to overlap the roof to stop it from flapping, the whole thing is nice and tightly wrapped. Then I cut a hole where the door is, and fastened the excess to the posts.

It's not very often I eat tinned food it took me a month to save these four. If you've got a tin opener that leaves a clean edge that's better, but mine doesn't so I squashed around the tops with a pair of pliers to tidy them up.I used upholstery samples to cover them, but you can use any thick fabric, cut a piece that is twice the height of the can, and wide enough to wrap around the circumference, adding a quarter of an inch for the seams. Sew it into a tube inside out, I do it by hand. Turn it right side out and check that it fits the can exactly. Turn it inside out again. Cut two circles of fabric, don't forget to add enough for seams, sew one on the bottom of the tube, pin it first. Turn it right side out and check that the can fits snugly inside.If you are going to decorate it with something soft like the two white crochet flowers, you can add those to the finished pen holder because it's easy to sew them on from the outside. But if you want to put something on that needs sewing from the inside, you need to do that before you put the can inside. It is very fiddly, you have to roll the tube down so you can get inside.I cut seven small hexagons from aluminium drinks cans and pierced each one around the edge with a pin, and stitched them on. For the one on the right I cut three green strips from a shampoo bottle, and cut out three plastic flowers, and made the holes for sewing them on with a hot nail over the gas cooker.To finish them off push the can inside down to the bottom, and sew on the second circle, you will have to do some of the stitching on the right side of the fabric, but it doesn't matter because this will be pushed down inside the can.You can put any decoration on them, maybe personalising them with a name if you want to give them as a gift.

I also got a bottle of wine so we could start celebrating as soon as we got back.Later, Carol spent a couple of hours in the kitchen, but I am more an outdoor person so I left her to it and did some weeding and hedge trimming for her. I had given her three small bushes that I had grown from cuttings so she showed me where to plant them. Then we took all the food to the club in readiness for tonight. That left one more task to do, get ready for the party. Carol is a member of a social club and helps organise some of the events, all the members were invited, and as is the custom, everyone makes a contribution to the food, there was loads of it. The party was great, lots of dancing, eating, and drinking. We were planning on walking home but some kind soul offered us a lift which was a good job because we ended up with lots of presents to carry. This is Carol and her cake.

Carol doesn't actually need anything, having chosen a much more lucrative career path than me, I know her house is lovely, and she wears the best clothes and accessories. I asked if she would like something for her garden and she replied an ornament would be nice.I had a trip to the garden centre in mind this morning when I finished my business in town. I called in the hospice charity shop on the way back to my car to see if they had some new knitting wool in. Down at the bottom of the well stocked shop is the household and ornaments section, and then I saw it, straight ahead on the middle shelf, the perfect garden ornament. A very large painted snail, perfect, only it wasn't a proper garden ornament it was a biscuit barrel.

There are supposedly no right and wrong score directions, but I think it is fairly obvious that they would give you a wide berth if you admitted to being a lazy, miserable, untidy slob.On reading the brief summary of my scores the first impression I got was that I would be the ideal candidate, but on looking a little closer there seems to be gentle hints that my personality could be a bit of a problem when it comes to conforming and fitting into their mould.I scored eight on the Agreeableness scale, this means I would be perceived as genuine and sincere in my desire to help people and do my best, but I would find it difficult to deal with people who are brusque or off hand. Too right I would, manners cost nothing. My Conscientiousness score was also eight, this indicates I am quite a methodical and neat person, and I have the capacity to be painstaking. I would pay attention to detail....correct, but pay less attention to obvious things like punctuality....also correct, what's a few minutes late now and then, I always turn up. Then my score plummets to four, for Conformity, this made me laugh. It says I am a fairly unorthodox person who occasionally likes to be something of a non conformist. It goes on....I probably don't place the same high value on social convention as many of the people who work within the company, oh dear, maybe a square peg in a round hole! Then it says if I try to introduce some form of innovation into the working environment I could find the emphasis placed on following procedures was a little restrictive. Too right I will, I have a brain and I am capable of using it. On the plus side it says I am an original thinker, yep. Moving on to Extroversion, I am up to a score of nine on this one. I am energetic and outgoing, and motivated by any kind of challenge, I would agree with that. But it's not going to get me anywhere in a company that stiffles individuality. I seem to have some plus points in my Emotional Stability, it suggests I am a fairly confident and optimistic person, that's a fair assumption. I am likely to be enthusiastic, and able to make most descisions on my own without asking for help from my superiors. Saying that, my superiors are likely to be younger than me, so that scenario is a possibility. It says I could cope with most pressure, agree, I am very laid back, and have been known to doze off while someone is talking to me.

I started off by cutting eight x 8cm squares out of aluminium drinks cans, then making holes round the edges with a paper punch, making sure they are evenly spaced. Trim off the sharp corners. I found it easier to make the template out of cardboard first. Next I did a row of black crochet, double stitch, around each one, three stitches into each hole, five stitches into the corner holes. Then two rows of red crochet single stitch, and another row of black crochet single stitch. Forgot to take a photo at this stage, but similar to the juice bag. Next I stitched the two lots of four together to make two sides, and did another row of black single stitch all the way around. Then I joined the two pieces together right side out, with a row of single stitch black crochet. I decided to make two handles out of cans, rather than one long knitted shoulder strap, this is the template I made and one of the handles.Each handle is in two pieces joined together with an edging of one row of single stitch in black. I have sandwiched a tent peg (bent end cut off) between the two pieces to strengthen them. Next I stitched the handles to the inside of the bag, and finished it off with a lining made from a skirt I got from a charity shop a long time ago. I'm very pleased with it.

One man had two tables full of stuff and several boxes in front, with a notice saying everything is 20p. Worth a look I thought, even better than a Pound shop.I got a couple of handbags with chrome handles that can easily be removed, and transplanted onto my hand made bags, and a large net curtain which I will use to cover my brassicas when they start appearing. I am going to step up my battle with the cabbage white butterflies this year. I popped in the nearby Poundstretcher store, I have noticed that a lot of discount stores now have an expanding food section, so inevitably there will be many more opportunities to find out of date stuff. I was lucky, I got three packs of 6 pack Princes Tropical Fruit drink, reduced from 99p to 49p. Five cherry coconut oat bars reduced from 39p to 20p, and the best find was five packets of Whitworths apricots for 1p each, that's right, one pence each! Next stop was the DIY store for a bag of compost for my forthcoming seed sowing. Outside the door was a beautiful border collie, mostly white with a few brown and black splodges, with it's lead loosely round one of those concrete bollards. I felt a bit concerned that someone had left it there, probably to go inside the shop. A few weeks ago I saw a terrible story in the newspapers about an elderly man who had left his dog tied up outside a supermarket, when he came back it had gone. Two youths had taken it and killed it, heartbreaking story. The collie was called Sasha, I looked at the tag on it's collar, no contact details though. I went into the shop, but had to come back out again because I was so worried that she might come to harm. Call me an interfering old woman if you like, but I could not walk away until I knew she was safe. I waited for nearly half an hour watching Sasha looking for it's owner, I was beginning to think she may have been abandoned. Eventually a young woman appeared, and at once Sasha acknowledged that her owner had come for her. The woman adjusted the dogs collar which I had noticed wasn't fastened properly, a clear indication that she was the owner. Was I relieved!

It worked! I met up with a crowd of people, and after signing in, Sarah, our Ranger, briefly outlined the plan, and told us there were a couple of points where we could shorten the walk if we felt it was too much.

He told me he was a member of the Barefoot Society, and has been doing rambles with no boots on for years. He said he is used to it and feels no pain. Even the thought of it makes my eyes water, ouch! I had never heard of such a society, so he told me the web address, if anyone wants to get started on barefooting here is the linkhttp://www.barefooters.org/Sure enough, he did the five miles without crying once :-)I have been thinking about the idea of showing and demonstrating my bag making, and other craft projects using recycled rubbish, and came up with the idea of setting a table up in a suitable place where people could come and chat to me about it. Waters Edge seems the ideal place, so after the walk I took some samples to show them to see their reaction. Bruce thought it was a great idea and suggested I could come when they have an organised event, then there would be more people there. We talked about the possibility of me doing some workshops, the school holidays would be a good time for this. Bruce said he would pass on my details to the recycling manager at the council because they would be interested.

My highlighter pen came in handy and I marked some of the news items which I thought would make interesting topics to chat about, then I was called into the studio.Lara is great fun to talk to, she is friendly and chatty, and everything flowed perfectly. She introduced me as Meanqueen. We didn't get around to discussing many news stories because she was keen to quiz me on my money saving trips to the supermarkets.

Then we went past the fishing pond and turned right along the river bank, keeping well away from the water, as neither of us fancied diving in to pull the little scamp out.

If you use them all you could save \u00a32.75, but of course if you don't normally buy the products your shopping bill will escalate and you will end up with things that you don't really need.To get the best out of them you have to be fairly disciplined. Keep them in your purse and not forget to hand them in when you get to the checkout. How many times have you tidied your bulging purse only to find you have coupons a year out of date, another good reason to be tidy.Then you have to study the products the coupons relate to, if there are brands that you don't normally get would it be worth your while to have a change for a week, if using the coupon would be cheaper than your normal brand? For instance, there is a 50p off coupon for Weetabix Weetos, would this make it cheaper than my usual Value Bran Flakes at 70p per 750grms, I doubt it very much, so I will dump that one.There is one coupon that I would definately use, and that's for Pilgrim cheddar cheese. I like this cheese, so providing there isn't a special offer on another brand that is equally as good, I will use it. I won't compromise with cheap tasteless cheese.Another trick is to make a note of the closing dates on the coupons, some of them are valid for several weeks. You could wait to see if your particular favourite item is going to be part of an instore promotion, a special offer, then you would get the store reduction plus the coupon discount.Don't forget that the magazine is free, so if there is a coupon for something you always get in your shopping, pick up several copies and stockpile a few while the offer is on. All the coupons can only be used in Tesco, except for the cheese, so I could look around the other supermarkets for that one.Are you with me on this ladies, let's become a little more savvy with our shopping and see how much money we can keep in our purses.

One day the teacher set us a task, write a story about a most important person. It didn't take me long to decide who I should write about. While most of my class mates wrote about famous people they had heard about in history, who had invented something or discovered a lost continent, the most important person as far as I was concerned was my mum. I used to listen to her for hours telling me what it was like growing up in Hamburg, and then later, stories of the war. The teacher commended me on my choice.As a teenager I used to have penfriends, it was quite a popular past time amongst my friends. I remember Janet from Aberystwyth, and Jane from New Zealand, I wonder where they are now?I carried on writing when I parked up overnight in my truck, scribbling away with pen and notepad after I had eaten my pot noodle, not great cooking facilities in a cab.

He said he is going to do three pages about me, I think he will need three whole issues to get it all in :-)The wild garlic is starting to grow now in the woods, I love that smell, can't resist plucking a few leaves to rub between my fingers and take in the aroma, wonderful. There used to be deer in the woods but I haven't seen any for ages. There's plenty of rubbish though. It's terrible the way people spoil the beautiful countryside. If everyone in the whole country joined in a massive litter pick, there wouldn't be enough landfill space to put it, perhaps that's why they leave it lying around. We have a beautiful country here, it's a shame to see it in such a mess.When I got home I rang the cattery in Flixborough and told them about the cat and where it was.

I love rock and roll, the mersey sounds, the mods and rockers, and flower power. These songs stand the test of time, not like the music today's teenagers listen to, here today and gone tomorrow. Oh dear, I sound like my grandmother. Our pop music had words you could sing along to, and music with a melody that was embedded in your brain forever. I went to a sixties outdoor concert a couple of years ago, some of the original groups were playing. I got my place right at the front and sang along with all the songs, the words are all still in there.I've started to give out my invitations, I managed to get some lovely cards from Woolies just before they closed, 20 cards for 10p, amazing luck that I found them.

I think that's better than people giving me something I don't really need which will end up in a drawer.

Everyone is very friendly and there's a great deal of light hearted banter going on. In fact it's more like having a structured and interesting chat with like minded people, better than going down the pub with your mates.I didn't like school very much when I was younger, that's probably because I never really excelled in anything. I liked the practical subjects like needlework, cookery and art, but didn't like sports because I was always worried I might hurt myself thrashing around on a hockey field or jumping over a hurdle. I had a mental block where maths was concerned, and I couldn't for the life of me understand the point of history.But now it's different, things are dropping into place, things are making more sense.

I set off towards Alkborough about three miles away. The village is high up on the hillside, overlooking the spot where three rivers meet, the Humber, Ouse, and Trent. I stopped at the maize to admire the extensive view across to Yorkshire, this is a maize cut into the turf, not one you can walk round as I thought when I first came here twelve years ago.In September 2006 a breach was cut into the flood defence bank creating a flood storage area, allowing flooding during extreme weather such as tidal surges.

They have made two pedestrian/cycle paths around the perimeter, I rode along the first one as far as I could which stopped at the breach, and came back. Then I cycled along the second path, and saw a beautiful white barn owl hovering and swooping down to catch his prey. At the end I had to turn back because it went into a footpath across a field, although my bike could have made it I am no expert at rough riding.Now to tackle the hill back up again. It was too steep to cycle down so there was no way I could pedal back up.

Our parents had to work through hard times after the war, things were in short supply so there was a lot of make do and mend going on. Mum taught me how to crochet, knit, and sew.I can picture my mother now on her old treadle sewing machine, she made all the soft furnishings, curtains, cushions etc, and most of her own dresses. When I was old enough to use the machine I followed her example and made my own clothes. I remember I had a good line in mini skirts going, I would get a piece of fabric off the market and knock one up in a couple of hours, then I sold them to my mates. My mum was an expert at making tasty meals out of not very much at all, another talent I have inherited from her. We always went picking elderberries together and came back with masses of them. It was our job to strip all the berries off the stalks using a fork, then they would go in a big pot and simmer on the stove. They were strained through cotton fabric several times and the juice bottled up. This was our Ribena, we thought it was lovely, much better than the shop bought juice which we couldn't afford. March 20th is the aniversary of my mum's death, she died 27 years ago aged 64, she would have been 91 on March 4th. This is a picture of her first son, my elder brother Ingo. She made all his clothes, here he is wearing a knitted jumper and trousers, with matching socks. Isn't he a lovely little fella? He lives in Bremen, Germany. I can't part with this door mat that mum made out of plaited tights. It's never been used, and I keep it in the sideboard that I inherited from her. Isn't she clever making this, just one example of her many ideas. I found this photo of her, proudly holding the prize she won for the best Easter bonnet, her friend and next door neighbour, Mitti, is on the left. She had a creative flair for anything and could make amazing things with a few scraps of fabric and a needle and cotton.

Then fold it twice so that you have a piece that has eight layers. Get two pieces of paper, I used baking paper, and sandwich the plastic in between. Press down with a hot iron for a few seconds, this is the fusion bit, all eight layers are supposed to stick together. Hooray, it works.I tried it with several bags, the plastic goes crinkly. Best not to have the iron on a high setting or the first layer shrivels up too quickly and the inside layers don't stick together. The Sainsbury's bag made a lovely textured orange piece, very interesting, now what can I make with it?I made a square of plain white plastic, eight layers of a charity sack, and put some coloured stripes across it, to see how that would turn out, it looks quite arty. You could cut any shapes out of coloured plastic and make up pictures, or you could sew the pieces together to make bags.

This is my plan, it is hanging on my office wall, a calendar, and notice board that I can pin all my cuttings to.I am collecting information about what's going on in my area, from magazines, newspapers, notice boards, and leaflets at the library. There is such a lot to do if you make the effort of using your eyes and ears to find out about it. I can't walk past a shop window with a lot of posters in it, I have to read and digest each one, is there anything I should know about? The same with the free paper, well it's free, so I read it.

My plan is to get as many free days out as I can, find out what activities cost no money, go and take part and enjoy them, take photo's and write about them. I made a start today. We have a walking group organised by volunteers, called Walking the Way to Health in North Lincolnshire, I picked up a leaflet at the beginning of the year. I checked it at 9am this morning and found there was a walk of nearly three miles, starting in the next village at 10.30, just the job, get the boots on, pick up Ben, and off we went. These walks are very popular, usually between 30 and 50 people turn up, I was pleased to see there were people there I had met before. They are a friendly group, always someone to chat to. Looking at the programme I think I am going to do the longer walks of seven miles, a short stroll is pleasant, but sometimes I like to push myself a bit more. Years ago I could easily walk 20 - 25 miles in a day, I remember on my 30th birthday I did a 30 mile walk, organised by the army, a great way to celebrate, I thought. I don't think I will be doing a 60 mile walk in May though, now that would be pushing it a bit too far. I am hoping to get a lot of the dates filled in on my calendar on the wall. I see there is a free tour of the crematorium organised for the end of March, that should be interesting, and there are some art exhibitions coming up at the 20 21 Arts Centre.

She sounded really sad, and at a loss as to what to do next.They then broadcast live from the exhibition, which seemed mainly about companies offering training courses. There was a lot of chat about having to look for new skills if you want to rejoin the job market. This is when I had a little rant to myself, retrain if you want to, but retrain for what exactly? You tell me which industries are looking for new staff, where are the jobs for all these retrained people because I can't see any on web sites, in the job centre, and in newspapers.These exhibitions are nothing but a wallpapering excercise, let's stand behind a facade, get people signed up on courses, that will keep the government happy.

I would like to tell her to stop applying for jobs that she won't get, stop building herself up only to be knocked down again, and stop beating herself up about not having a job. She will end up in a mental home if she doesn't take control of her life now. The best thing she can do is to take a close look at her finances, look at her incomings and outgoings, and if she has a family get them involved too.

My seed potatoes are installed on the window sill, hopefully to produce the first signs of life. I have been preparing for the new growing season and feel quite excited, I like to be ready. The first year I did it, it was all a bit of a rush, I went mad sowing seeds willy nilly not knowing what was going to come up. I was amazed when I did so well, especially as it was a bit of a hit and miss affair. I don't know anything about the different types of soil, the bugs that eat your food before you do, and when things should be planted, I like the idea of a surprise. I ended up with 69 tomato plants and was eating them untill December.Last year I said I wouldn't grow so much, but did it happen, no! I ended up with 88 tomato plants, and was eating beans, courgettes, tomatoes and cucumbers till they came out of my ear holes. Anyway, I'm getting things ready again, collecting usefull bits and bobs, certainly don't want to buy anything. Have you seen those fancy plastic propogators with a lid? Don't need them. This is what you want, any plastic bottles, yoghurt pots, especially those with a lid on, plastic drinks cups, and plastic food trays. If you haven't got lids a bit of cling film will do to keep the seeds snug till they get going.Large plastic water bottles can be cut open on the side to make a propogator, leave the lid attached, or the top cut off for a planter. Food trays are handy, don't forget to cut holes in the bottom. You can put a tray on the top to act as a lid. If you are going to give away or sell plants and you don't want to give a pot away with it, use drinks cartons, make holes in the bottom, these soya milk cartons are ideal. You can also use dry cat food bags to plant stuff in if you haven't much room in your garden. I have made some more plant labels out of an oblong margarine tub, just cut strips of plastic. My plant ties are cut up strips of plastic bags, you can get loads out of a charity sack. These plastic storage boxes come in handy for planting any extras in if you haven't room in the beds. I have to confess I bought these in a rush because I had plants coming up and nowhere to put them., but they will last a good few years and were only 97p each. Last year I had courgettes, broad beans, carrots, beetroot, dwarf beans, and even six runner beans with canes, in them. I lift them off the ground onto wood to give a better drainage. I built a cloche that just fits over four of them while the new plants need protection from the weather. If you want to rearrange your garden you can just move them around to suit.These are the blue plastic crates I get out of the skip outside the takeaway, they are very handy for transporting small pots around the garden. Handy in the potting shed, and the greenhouse. I have got that many now I might sell some to other gardeners. So as you can see I am nearly ready. The raised beds are full of compost, soil, and hoss muck, just need turning over and a bit of fertiliser added. I need to get a fresh bag of compost for the seeds, and the greenhouse and plant shelters need recovering in plastic. I managed to get a free roll of industrial shrink wrap for that job. I might not grow potatoes in compost bags this year if I can find other suitable containers. I had such a job last year picking out all the slugs and snails hidden in the folds of the bag.

I like going with my instincts and doing what I think is best, and dealing with the consequences if I have made the wrong choice. Big decisions need a lot of thought, like which direction do you want your life to go, but now we seem to be bombarded with so many choices for such trivial matters, that can screw you up if you let them.In my quest for a simple life I have made the decision to limit my choices on small unimportant matters, the more clutter I can delete from everyday life the more I value life.For instance, it is important that I spend time getting the most for my money whilst food shopping, but, there are a lot of things I will not eat. This cuts out many of the supermarket aisles which I don't venture down at all. I miss out meat, (fresh, frozen, and canned), cakes, biscuits, crisps, fizzy drinks, alchohol, all freezers except veggies, most of the dairy except yoghurt, soya milk, and cheese. I also give a wide berth to sauces and pickles, jams, household cleaning products, and all non food. It makes shopping so much easier.As I said, I buy my food on price and quality, this also limits my choices, but I like that. When I shop I don't walk around thinking what do I fancy for my dinner. I buy what is on special offer or reduced at the time, and plan my meals around that. Contrary to what most people think, that having a shopping list helps you spend less, for me the opposite is true. If you have a plan for your meals then you have to get the ingredients to make them. I have no plan, I eat what is cheap, even if it means having the same meal for three of four nights on the trot. Less choices to worry about, and less food thrown away because I eat everything I buy.In the house I apply the principal of if you haven't got one you don't need it, and if it doesn't work you can't switch it on, simple. My central heating conked out a couple of years ago, people have offered help and advice to get it sorted, and I have declined. My thoughts are, if it doesn't work I dont have to make the decision whether to turn it on or not, get rid of the choice, it's easier. The same with a television, I don't have one so that takes away the decision of whether to watch it or not. If I had one I know I would sit on my bum for hours and become a cabbage, best to take the choice away and not have one at all.It's a good job I have never tried smoking, can't for the life of me understand why people do that, but that is their choice.Daily spend - \u00a318.03 landline"}, {"title": "Easy to make bag", "date": "Tuesday 17 February 2009", "text": "I'm posting early today because I am excited about the bag I have just finished, and wanted to share it with you.

It was an experiment to see how easy it was to make, I don't intend to go into full scale production, though some people say I could sell them. It's an evening bag, the tie is swirled round, a bit like a coil, pinned into place and stitched very carefully. The broad end is at the bottom and the narrow end is the handle. It was a bit floppy so I made a stiffener out of an old plastic tablecloth, the same shape as the tie, and threaded it through the middle. It has a button fastener, I left a small gap where I joined the tie to make the button hole, and there is a matching button to attach the handle to the bag, with a piece of chain added for decoration. I didn't cut the tie at all and it doesn't need a lining.There is room for a small purse, keys, mobile phone, and a few essential small items that a girl might need on a night out.

It is then used for craft projects.I found it tucked away behind the Blind Centre, there was a board outside and a sign on the fence. I went in and thought I was in heaven. There was all kinds of usefull stuff, card and paper, plastic bottles, fabric, wallpaper, beads and jewellery, net, lace, fur, ribbon, and a million and one other things. I had a chat with a very nice lady called Lorraine, she told me they could do with some more volunteers, and I met Phil who also works there.This is the sort of thing I would like to get involved with, because whatever can be used again means less going to landfill.

It all started with one cat, a little fella who didn't have a proper home, his owner went off and left him to fend for himself at ten months old. I fell in love with the little bundle of ginger fur, so I took him in. Bugsy is now twelve years old.Next a scruffy, filthy, battle scarred black tom appeared at the back door, looking pleadingly at me for some food. Of course he got it. A few weeks later a trip to the vet, and he moved in, haven't the faintest idea where he came from. I asked around if anyone had lost one, but no one came forward. It was hell for about eighteen months as Freddie, named after Freddie Mercury, attacked Bugsy to try and drive him away. I almost gave up, poor Bugs ended up with bitten bleeding ears, and lumps of fur pulled out. Eventually things settled down.My back door is often open as the cats like to wander in and out. One day I caught a very small tabby cat stealing the food, and he kept on coming every day. I asked around the neighbours and was pointed to the house he belonged to, I went to ask about him. Yes he did belong to them, he is called Smartie, he is 13 years old and he lives down the garden in an old dog kennel. I spotted the filthy food dishes outside the back door. The man said, 'kick him out.' I couldn't do that, poor little soul wants a bit of home comforts at that age, so he stayed. He has put on a bit of weight now he is getting some good food. I have been back several times since with some updates on how he is, but they are not interested.The last time the man said, 'oh, is he still alive.' Yes he is and he's gorgeous.No, no more, please! We have been getting regular visits from a black cat a few doors down, most of the time he steals the food and goes, but sometimes he settles down on the settee. I definately don't want any more......but it's fine if he calls in sometimes for a bit of love and cuddles. Oh dear I am a sucker !

OK, I know I have to drive myself there, but it isn't far, it only takes fifteen minutes. Last night I started Psychology, and tonight was social Sciences, these courses are over ten weeks. Now the good part is that they are free, and the bonus is that I go past Tesco to get there. They finish at 8.30pm, an ideal time as I mentioned before, to go shopping.Last night I got some amazing bargains, bread at 7p a loaf, chicken slices for the cats for 30p, pack of six youghurts for 10p, and a \u00a37.50 Dalek cake for 72p, plus some other reductions. I reckon if I only shop at this time for the next nine weeks I can save a fortune. I am getting to the stage where I don't want to pay full price anymore, and I'm thinking it might be possible to have every single item in my trolley either with a yellow sticker on, or a special offer, or a BOGOF offer. I'm going to try it. It might mean changing from a brand that I normally buy, but I can be flexible to save money. It isn't important for me to stick to the same food every week, so some changes might make it interesting.Of course I wouldn't buy a special offer if the reduced price was way above what I would normally pay, because it was a very expensive item in the first place. I have a lot of prices fixed in my head, and I can never be tempted by something that is not what it appears. My head has an inbuilt calculator.

The pink fabric is from a very old curtain, the white lacey trimming I salvaged from a skip (lampshade), small buttons from my button box, pink elastic from a box of chocolates, two metal buttons you cover yourself my friend gave me. It's easy to make, knit an oblong piece, twice the size you want the bag, fold in half. The video tape will not slide along the needles as you knit and there is no give in the tape, so you have to adjust the tension of every stitch. Cut the lining longer, so you have enough to fold over and enclose the edge. Cut two long pieces for the handles, sew along the edge and turn inside out and neatly sew the end.

I picked the last few brussel sprouts and pulled up the stalks and raked over the raised beds. The compost heap is humming away nicely, covering it with old plastic compost bags keeps it cooking. I built the raised beds out of pallets, cut them in half and stand them on their ends. Nail them together with odd pieces of wood, and make a row of three.

Oh no, they have sold out of cat food, expecting some more to come in, that's a bit annoying. Then I remembered I needed some cereal.

Just made it with a minute to spare. I waited my turn, I heard my name being called but couldn't see where it was coming from. There have been that many new people registering for job seekers, that they have had to increase the amount of signing desks and train up staff to deal with the influx. I dutifully reported what jobs I have applied for. There was no point in trying to access the job vacancies computer points, all of them had a notice on saying out of action, probably run out of jobs, shut up shop, sorry no jobs.I decided on a bit of research around the town centre. We have one of those shops where you can buy household items like furniture and electrical goods, and pay weekly, they seemed pretty busy. The banners said, 'Beat the Crunch, No Deposit, and No Credit Checks.' I studied what was on offer through the window. A pair of quality refurbished (it said so on the sign), two seater, brown leather sofas. A bargain price (?) for cash \u00a3654.12. If you want it on the never never, tick, or slate, whatever you like to call it, you can pay \u00a313.58 per week for 55 weeks, giving a total of \u00a3746.90. Then it gets worse, if you want to include a service cover in that it would be \u00a316,98 per week, making it \u00a3933.90. My god, is anyone daft enough to fall for that, it seems they are judging by the number of people who stepped inside and handed over their cash.The main item in the window to pull in the punters, was a strategically placed 42inch refurbished Ambilight Philips TV, so placed to catch the eye of everyone passing. If you want to pay cash it is a snip at \u00a3792.06, I think not. You could elect to pay \u00a38.77 over 120 weeks making it \u00a31,052.40. If you want to include service charge cover and digi service cover that will be \u00a313.49 per week, making it a total of \u00a31618.80. What was horrifying was that there was no posh, well dressed, obviously affluent people crossing the threshold while I was standing there, they looked like they were families struggling to make ends meet.These refurbished goods they are selling are possibly reposessed from people not able to keep up the payments. What annoys me is they way the shop advertises 29.9% interest, doesn't that sound a whole lot better than 30%, a devious trick. I wanted to stop everyone going in and say to them don't do it, you are signing your life away. Get a sofa out of the charity shop down the road, you don't need a tele that big, but I didn't want to get arrested. These shops are like piranha fish, they will strip you bare, they prey on peoples weaknesses, and vulnerabilities. They don't bring hopes and dreams to people, they bring misery.

I'm not sure of the longevity of the negatives, probably forever because I have had some of them for ten years or more.

I had a good scout round, first to the shelves in the top left hand corner to look for reduced prices, nothing I fancied there and not cheap enough. I found a good deal on mature cheese, 500grm for \u00a32, better than the 400grm I picked up last week for the same price. Fresh salmon caught my eye, I only buy this if it is reduced, so from \u00a33.34 down to \u00a31.67, I picked up a couple of packets, one to eat now and one for the freezer. I got cabbage reduced from 68p to 25p, carrots 37p, fruity snack bars reduced to 5p, plus a few other items.I must admit I did spend a lot of time chatting to people about prices, a lovely old couple in their 80's who drove their car there, a nice lady assistant who was reducing some prices, and I pointed a couple in the direction of the reduced salmon, anything to help my fellow shoppers.

I had a scan round to see if any more of my favourites were on offer, I am sure I have radar on my head which draws me towards the bargains. Quorn fillets \u00a31, veg bakes 80p, a quick look at the end of aisle displays, and the radar is buzzing.

Although I am known as the Meanqueen of North Lincolnshire, the only reason I chose the name is because I want to buy things as cheaply as possible, though I would prefer not to buy things at all, and besides, it is rather a catchy name. I am also unmean, I raise money for animal charities, I help people walk dogs, and give my excess vegetables away. Tight is another word for mean, I am not that either, I call myself frugal.But why do I have a frugal lifestyle, giving up what most people would think is normal to have, like central heating and television? The first answer is that if I don't spend money, I don't have to earn it, which gives me more time to do what I want to do. The second answer is that I save money in some areas of my life so that I can channel it into things that are important to me. And the third answer is that I want to reduce my impact on the planet, to rob the earth of it's resources, in my mind, is criminal. I am frugal for all these reasons. I have a car because I like the freedom it gives me, but I keep my journeys to a minimum. I have the internet because it is my entertainment and a learning tool. Television is a big waste of time, and I can keep my body perfectly clean in a couple of bowlfulls of hot water. I took these photographs today as an illustration of a frugal life.

Apparently they have a policy of not reducing the prices like the supermarkets do. I think that is scandalous. It has been on the news today that they are closing some shops because they are losing money, I'm not surprised when they are chucking perfectly good stuff in the bin."}, {"title": "Radio Star", "date": "Wednesday 7 January 2009", "text": "Well that was an early start to the day. I had to set my alarm for 6.30am, so I would have enough time to have a cup of coffee and wake myself up before BBC Radio Hereford and Worcester rang me. I picked up the station early on the iplayer, aren't computers wonderful, and listened in to get a taste of the theme of the programme. Five to Eight the phone rang and I was live on air. It was all about the TV programme I am on, on Friday night, Hunt for the Tightest Person in Britain. They asked me about wearing boys pants, which I do, because they last a lot longer than girls knickers, which stretch and fall apart after a few months. I love boys pants, they go on forever and so they are cost effective because they hardly ever need replacing. There wasn't much time for chatting. I told them how I wear more clothes inside the house than out, due to the lack of central heating, my choice I may add, and I put my widdle on the compost heap to cut down on wasting water on toilet flushing, don't think they were too impressed with that one. I could almost feel the cringe and a sharp intake of breath.Even more excitement this afternoon, a phone call from a reporter at the Scunthorpe Telegraph. After half an hour of questions, he said he will send a photographer round, he wants to get the article in the paper for tomorrow. A very nice young lady came round with a very big and complicated looking camera, we had a lot of fun in the bedroom with toilet rolls and my pants, don't ask, it's all to do with the programme. Autograph anyone?"}, {"title": "My latest creation", "date": "Tuesday 6 January 2009", "text": "Here is my latest creation, and it didn't cost me a penny. I made this knitted shopping bag out of eleven plastic charity bags, cut into one inch strips. They leave them on your doorstep for a donation but fail to collect when you haven't put anything in them, so I found a use for them. The dimensions are 15\" high, 10\" wide, with a 4\" wide gusset. The handles are made seperately, (3 stitches) and I fixed it all together using a rug pegger. I shall be taking it out on a trial shopping trip later this week, it should stand up to the job because it is pretty strong. Now, what am I going to make next?"}, {"title": "Thank goodnes it's over", "date": "Monday 5 January 2009", "text": "Time to take the Christmas decorations down, a very quick job for me as I only had this tree decoration that I made, and a few coloured lights along the window sill. I had a very frugal Christmas, in fact I didn't really do Christmas at all. The frenzy of shopping, wracking your brains wondering what presents to get, eating loads of food and drinking yourself silly, not much fun I think. Oh dear, makes me sound like a grumpy old woman, but I visited family on Christmas Day, that was nice, and I had my treats, a bottle of Port and some chocs.My tree has been stripped of it's leaves and berries and put away for next year. I made it out of twigs I had in the garden, cut them to size and nailed them together. The base is an empty tin filled with cat litter, some coloured paper sellotaped around it and foliage attached with elastic bands. I think my free hand made tree is better than anything you can buy in a shop. There are lots of things you can make for no money, if you look around the hedgerows. I made this autumn display with foliage I picked from around the fishing pond when I was walking Ben, in October. It is so satisfying to make things from scratch, even better if you have recycled something that would have been thrown away. It makes me think about what people did before High Street shops, and wouldn't it be great to get back to basics and make things again. The way things are going at the moment, with the threat of people losing their jobs and shops closing, we might have to. Then all the past skills that our grandparents used to have will once again be resurected."}, {"title": "A cold Sunday", "date": "Sunday 4 January 2009", "text": "It's been a very cold day today in this house without heating, but we have managed. I gave in to the cats though and put the gas fire on for a while in the living room, Freddie and Lilly sat gazing lovingly at the warm glow. This morning I was trying to get my knitted bag finished, only the handles left to put on. I saw something on a web site about cutting plastic carrier bags into strips and knitting them into a new bag. I have a lot of those charity bags which are a lot bigger but they never seem to collect them, so I have been using those. I'll put a picture on here when it is finished.This afternoon I took my friends dog, Ben for a walk, some people think dog walking is a chore, but I love it. I have three cats so I can't have a dog, I wouldn't want the ties anyway, so it suits me to borrow someone elses dog. I have been walking Ben for three years, he is adorable. He lives very close to me and I have a key to the house so I can take him out whenever I like. Within minutes we are in the countryside, it's very high up here and the views are stunning across the River Trent, on a clear day I can see for miles across Yorkshire. I am definately a country bumpkin at heart, what could be better than the woods and fields, the valleys and the hills, I'm in my element. Here is my best friend.I don't like spending hours in the kitchen cooking fancy food, after all, it all goes the same way whether you have spent three hours on it or five minutes. Plain and simple food suits me and my purse. Tonight I have made a veggie stew in a big pan that will last me three days, and it's lovely. I picked some sprouts and cabbage from my garden, then I added half a swede, two big carrots, two onions, a tub of cooked green tomatoes I froze in October when it looked unlikely that they would ripen, two apples, some pot barley, bulgur wheat, sesame seeds, linseed seeds, raisins, and a stock cube and spices, and sauce mix. My mum used to make stews like this, just throw anything in that you have, you can't beat it on a cold winters night. I'm iff to get a glass of Port now, my Christmas treat."}, {"title": "Searching for bargains", "date": "Saturday 3 January 2009", "text": "This morning I went into town to get some cat food from the market, this is the cheapest place to get it from. They often have good quality food at knock down prices because they are able to buy in stocks that are near or just beyond the sell by date. As my cats can't read it doesn't matter. I was unlucky today, they hadn't been able to get any in. As cat lovers will know, their pets are the most finicky eaters, mine like Felix As Good As It Looks, but they have had to have the ordinary Felix for the past few days. Oh dear, you should have seen the sulks. Anyway, resort to plan B, I had a scout around in the cut price stores and found some sachets at a reasonable price. I thought it's worth a try because they have had the dry food of the same name, and they like it.My next stop was Sainsbury's. I went in there because I knew I could look through all the papers without being disturbed, they are in the alcove away from the rest of the shop. I wanted to find anything that had my name or my photograph in. I am in a television programme on Channel 4 on Friday night at 7.30pm, it's called, 'The Hunt for the Tightest Person in Britain,' and I want to keep the cuttings for my scrap book. I didn't find any. Not to worry I had a quick check round the shop for any bargains, I don't buy much here because it is too expensive. I got three packs of multigrain bread rolls for \u00a31, a big bag of onions for 50p, and a bag of grapes at half price.Off I went to Tesco for the rest of my shopping. I didn't spend a lot because I only needed a few things that I am running out of, some carrots and swedes, and I got a butternut squash because they are on special offer. Felix cat food is on special offer so I got a box, it's not the one they like but tough, that's what they are getting. I don't shop for food very often but when I do I spend time getting the best value for my money. When I look at all the choice on the shelves I wonder why people buy such rubbish, and the prices are just crazy, they don't seem to mind, we'll have one of those, and those, bung it in the trolley. My shopping trip is a military operation.I put the computer on this afternoon to check on the forum of http://www.downthelane,net/ I am a moderator on there and it's fun. I see someone has posted that I am mentioned in the Daily Mail, and I also found out that The Independant has printed a letter I sent them, so off I went to my local paper shop to get my copies for my scrap book. I wouldn't ordinarily buy newspapers, I read them on the internet, but I think I can afford a couple. Oh dear, maybe I'm not the tightest person in Britain then."}, {"title": "Pleasures of a simple life", "date": "Friday 2 January 2009", "text": "Hi there, thanks for taking a look at my blog, this is my first attempt at blogging, so I hope you find something of interest. The main theme for the blog will be frugal living, because that is what I have been aspiring to for the last ten years. I decided to reduce my time at work, so reducing my income, and creating a whole new challenge, I now work at how to make ends meet. That may sound daunting to some people but it's easy, as long as you can differentiate between what you need and what you want. Making ends meet gives the impression that you are scrimping and saving worrying about where your next meal will come from, that is not true. For me it means making the most out of the money you have, getting the best value, the most food from the supermarket, and the challenge of surviving by your own means. I have never been in debt, always paying my way, so perhaps I am used to living within my means, luckily my mother taught me all about it. I have been a lorry driver for 32 years, something I am immensely proud of, in total I have worked for 44 years, and now it is time to slow down. All my hard work has almost paid for a house, still a bit to go so not completely debt free, but I am working on it. I am now looking forward to a fabulous retirement, but of course I will never fully retire because I like work. But from now on, any work I do will be on my terms, it will be something I want to do, and I will do it when I want to do it. There, a bit bolshie maybe but that's how I am, I know my own mind. Life is too short to be a slave, and by that I mean a slave to money. I have realised that I am perfectly happy with just enough, a simple life for me means less worries. Do I worry about money, of course not because I haven't got any. Please join me on my frugal journey, I am going to record just how I live my life on very little money. I'm not setting any targets, or making any rash statements like living on a \u00a31 a day, it will be a true story of how it really is. Don't expect me to be complaining about how expensive the cost of living is, or how fed up I am of having no money, that won't happen. Instead I want to open your eyes to the pleasures of a simple life, the enjoyment you can have out of life's free gifts, and how I wake up each day looking forward to the day ahead. See you later.
