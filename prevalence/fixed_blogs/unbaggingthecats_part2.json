I was leisurely browsing the internet like I didn't have a care in the world, instead of preparing to do battle with hard-core storm-shoppers over bread and milkWhen out on the porchThere arose such a clamorI peeped through the mini-blindsTo see who dared to yammer.It was Ann, our not-terribly-bright black german shepherd. She stormed down off that porch like a regular guard dog, and tore across the front acreage like she meant business. I was a bit discombobulated. She never gets all aggressive like that. Usually just stands right under the window and barks her fool head off. But this time, she was a bitch on a mission.I didn't see anything that might trigger her usual hair-trigger all-for-naught woofing. No marauding dogs, coyotes, foxes, rabbits, escaped horses, alleged meter-readers, or shadows. I kept my eyes on Ann. She barreled across the driveway to that section of yard that runs along the gravel road.FOUR DEER WERE STANDING LIKE SO MANY PRACTICE TARGETS AND YARD ORNAMENTS, LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDERS TOWARD THE HOUSE.Ann charged right up to them, never breaking stride, and they flagged their cottony tails at her and bounded up the gravel road. Darn that dog. What a pretty picture those deer would have made. They were big by Val standards. Their flipped-up tails were about ten inches tall. Not that women are good judges of that sort of thing, of course. Not an antler in the bunch, all were does. I suppose they were having their morning coffee klatch in our yard, since the hunters were thirsting for blood in the woods.That's just like Ann, to defend our homestead against the quartet of deer, who of course are much more dangerous than chicken-eating neighbor-dogs or strangers who make themselves at home on our range while we're away at work. She's also an ace at defending us from imaginary intruders between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m., from her loyal post just under our bedroom window.I don't know why Ann can't be more like my sweet, sweet Juno. Who would have herded those whitetails into a pretty parade formation for my viewing pleasure, having fortified herself with free-range chicken eggs and a heaping handful of cat kibble the previous evening."}, {"title": "I Guess You Could Say, \"Now She Has a Leg To Kiss On.\"", "date": "Monday, November 17, 2014", "text": "Mom is doing well after her surgery. Hick reported that she was a bit nervous before the big event, but had calmed down by the time they wheeled her into the operating room at 7:32. After three-and-a-half hours, she was being stitched up. Hick and my sister the ex-mayor's wife got to go see her for five minutes in the recovery room. Five minutes every hour. Mom finally got a room of her own around 3:00.MSTEMW sent me two pictures of Mom to show that she was okay. Mom was smiling, but I think that was the anesthesia talking. She had a little bit of a black eye on her surgery cheek, and a patch. The surgeon took some skin from her leg to close up the incision where he took out a hunk from her face. Hope Mom doesn't get the jimmy-leg while she's sleeping, like a dog when you scratch its belly. That could lead to some interesting YouTube videos. Not that I would do anything like that, of course.I sent MSTEMW a text about the picture. \"Is that a patch?\" Because it was an oval, like an Anjou pear, only the orange color of a new pebbly basketball. And it looked like the edges were stitched into Mom's skin.\"Yes. What did you THINK it was, another ear? Did you think the doctor gave her an extra ear?\" I really don't know where MSTEMW gets her sense of humor.\"No. I thought it might have been leg skin.\"\"Oh, the leg skin is there, but we didn't get to see it. It's under the patch.\"So...Mom called me this evening to report that's she's doing fine. Her throat is a little sore from the anesthesia tube. She has a roommate. \"But I can't...um...there might be a story there when I get out.\" Heh, heh. I've even got my post-surgery mom gathering material for me!Mom also reported that she got the surgery prep team tickled. \"I told them, 'This is my daughter, and this is my son-in-law.' And they got funny looks on their faces. Then your sister started in. 'I'M her daughter. But we're not together.' She pointed at Hick. Then she said, 'I don't want you to think we're divorced. Because we're not. We're not even together.' That went on for a while, until I said, 'Oh, that's my OTHER daughter's husband.' But that might have made it worse, because then they really looked confused.\"Mom said she's not in any pain right now. And that while she was out of it, that surgeon even took off an EXTRA skin lesion from her neck. She had told him before surgery that her doctor said it was nothing to worry about, and the surgeon agreed, but said he might as well take it off as long as he was cutting anyway, then she'd never have to worry about it. So Mom agreed. That surgeon! I guess he's a taker, not a giver.Mom should get to come home tomorrow if nothing goes wrong overnight. She said the staff was surprised she was eighty. They talked about her, apparently, like she was a precocious toddler. \"And she lives by herself, and cleans her own house!They're probably just glad she didn't ask for wine with her meal, or some heroin. Can't wait to hear Mom's roommate story."}, {"title": "Please Send Some Positive Thoughts For the Slaw Lady", "date": "Sunday, November 16, 2014", "text": "I have a request today.You know Val doesn't ask for much. A little song, a little dance...a little seltzer down her pants. WAIT! That was Chuckles the Clown from WJM. No, Val doesn't ask for much. An occasional comment about her Pulitzer-Prize-worthy journalism, educating the masses on new developments in the field of feces transplant research. An Emmy for her reports during sweeps month concerning the #1 Backroads crime of road-walking. A humanitarian award for her selfless devotion to the cast-offs of society, specifically three mailbox road cats and one tiny scrap of a canine that was being starved by Val's mom.Which brings us to the issue: Val's mom.Mom is having surgery at 7:30 a.m. Monday. If you could take a moment to send some positive thoughts her way, it would be greatly appreciated. She's a tough ol' gal, but the thought of facing a ride to the hospital at 4:00 a.m., and a five-hour surgery, and a night in the hospital are causing her to have a case of the nerves.Mom will be spending the night with us so she can get an early start. Genius's bed is available, but Mom is a chair sleeper. So she gets the La-Z-Boy. It won't bother Hick. He goes to bed at 9:00. He will be the official chauffeur, because I don't drive in the city. Funny (peculiar, not ha-ha) how I did it for years when I worked by the Bevo Mill, but now my highway confidence has plummeted. My sister the ex-mayor's wife will meet them in Backroads Monday morning, and accompany Mom to the hospital. The ex-mayor is taking the day off work to care for their 9-month-old grandbaby, usually the task of my sister the ex-mayor's wife. I will be going to school as usual, since someone has to haul The Pony around morning and afternoon. Mom said she didn't want me to go, that it was bad enough that Hick and MSTEMW would be sitting around waiting all day. In fact, she had first wanted my sister not to go, and for Hick to leave as soon as they took her into surgery. I told her that was not happening. Listen to me. Such a great daughter, and not even going to be at the hospital with my mom. I daresay I might not be a Five-Dollar Daughter for a while.Remember that growth on Mom's face that her doctor decided to lop off in the office, after forgetting to tell her to stop her blood-thinner, and then rescheduled? Well. He didn't get all of that growth. Which nobody knew until Mom told me way too after the fact that there was a place on her cheek that was bothering her after Doc did that office surgery. She always had her hair poofed down over that area, and I had not seen it since visiting her daily and cleaning the area until the stitches came out. Seriously. That European Space Agency's Rosetta satellite would have been able to see it FROM SPACE, had Rosetta not been so concerned with landing that probe Philae on comet 67P.So I made mom get another appointment, which took a while, and then Doc referred her to a specialist at Barnes, but the office gals took so long getting that appointment that Mom called and asked for Doc himself, who got her an appointment within a week instead of six weeks, and then the specialist needed more tests, and those tests required further tests, and, well, this has gone on simply too long. In fact, Mom was supposed to have surgery LAST Monday, but no, a further test was ordered, and a different specialist visit, and now Mom is at her wit's end. I don't blame her. The forecast of up to five inches of snow for our area tonight is not making it any easier.Anyhoo...I'm sure Mom will be fine. This surgeon says he does 35 of these operations a year. Mom is in good health for an recent octogenarian. She doesn't smoke or drink, has most of her faculties, and will NOT be requesting wine with her evening meal, or heroin. I can't vouch for slaw, though.Yes. I'm sure she will be fine. It's not like she'll be wearing a peanut suit and a rogue elephant will be waiting in the operating room to shell her."}, {"title": "A Cat Outstanding In His Field", "date": "Saturday, November 15, 2014", "text": "This morning as I backed T-Hoe out of the garage to do our weekly shopping a day early because of the impending snowpocalypse of 0.2 inches that is expected in Backroads by Sunday morning...The Pony, unfettered by the responsibility of driving, seated directly behind me, said, \"THAT'S not creepy at all.\" I finished backing before running a tire up over the six-inch curb around the carport slab (unlike Hick in a ice storm several years ago) and directed my attention to the front yard.That's what we saw. A creepy fat cat staring at us. Not amused. The Pony got another shot of him as I started up the driveway. Not that it was any less creepy.Yeah. That's one obese cat. It's not like we feed him any more than the other cats. They get the same pile of cat kibble dumped into a communal black-and-white-speckled roasting pan every morning. Less a couple of handfuls (large) for my sweet, sweet Juno and (small) for poor stupid Ann every evening.This is Stockings. He eats his feelings. Genius pushed to rescue him from the mailbox area down by the creek after somebody dumped a litter of kittens. We thought he was girl at first, and took him for spaying. He has never quite forgiven us, and the vet must have thought us simpletons, like those couples who have a surprise baby after nary an inkling low on nine months that they were pregnant.You won't catch Val putting her cat on a treadmill and making him lose weight until he dies. No sirree, Bob! He can live out his days in his corpulent splendor. He hates us. The fastest he ever moves is trying to avoid a pat.So...we go from this cat out sitting in our field to The Pony, outstanding in his field. He found out yesterday morning that he placed third in a writing contest! It's his first success, after limited submissions. He wins a T-shirt! Here's a link to his story. Not bad for a 16-year-old.

After attempting a fingernail and tooth entry like a rank amateur, Mrs. Thevictorian switched to the old standby: car keys. A simple jab did not do the trick, so she had to resort to sawing with T-Hoe's long ignition key.

If that happened, I daresay you would be hard-pressed to keep up with such an arduous regimen of two submissions per week for the month of November, what with having to first learn to read and write braille.Yes, Val is skipping merrily down the primrose path, plucking submissions from a wicker basket, strewing them all willy-nilly across the blogosphere. She's scattering submissions over the bedspreads of newlyweds in assorted honeymoon suites throughout the land, for aesthetic purposes, of course, not that they'll be doing any reading. Plenty more submissions where those came from...VAL'S HEAD! Uh huh.

So Val got down to brass tacks, pulled out all the stoppers (oops, this is not about cut-class brandy decanters) stops, and kicked it up a notch to ensure that her submissions were ready to slip into the mail Tuesday evening on the way home from work. You know. The first day of mail service for the week. Except that Veteran's Day was TUESDAY. So technically, Val could have taken another day. But she didn't!Anyhoo...three submissions are in the mail, last week's went out over the innernets, and by cracky, Val is pleased as punch that she has met her goal so far.Excuse me while I go ice the arm that I was using to pat myself on the back."}, {"title": "No Need To Start a Telethon for Val Just Yet", "date": "Tuesday, November 11, 2014", "text": "Hey! Have I told you about my newest disease? Wait! Come back! I'm sure you haven't heard this one. It's not like that time my mom went with me to an obstetrical appointment, and was near tears when I returned to the waiting room.\"Oh, honey! I was reading this magazine, and there was an article about a new disease which is sometimes fatal, and the more I read, the more I was convinced that I have it! I have all the symptoms! And then I turned to the back of the magazine to continue the article, and found out I'd been reading the pet column! It's a dog disease!\"No. It's not like that. I don't have a fatal dog disease. I didn't read about my symptoms in a magazine. No sirree, Bob! I gave myself a physical, and blanched at the findings. Okay. Not so much a physical as one might get at a doctor's office. More like an investigation of one's body after a red flag. Okay. Not so much a red flag as something out of the ordinary.I was sitting here at my New Delly in my dark basement lair, and had a little itch on my left side, kind of over the rib cage. So I reached down to scratch, with my bare left hand, not with my red wooden backscratcher, because it was my RIBS, silly, not my BACK. And besides, my red wooden backscratcher is out by the blue recliner by the big screen TV.So I reached down to scratch through the fabric of my purple pin-striped short-sleeved oxford big shirt, and had the most disconcerting realization that there was something on my skin! Not something like a bloated tick. That would be a dog disease. Try to keep up. I already told you it wasn't a dog disease. No, it was something like a firm mole. Not a mole like you might find tearing up your lawn. I'm pretty sure I would have noticed something that big up under my shirt before I felt an itch. Not a mole like a skin tag. They're flexible. They'll roll around like little blobs of that clear stuff that sticks labels on magazines.No, this skin growth was firm, almost rectangular in shape, and as I scratched, IT MOVED! Not like that...um...IT that moved on George Costanza when he got a free massage from Raymond the physical therapist after getting a note from Jerry's dentist who was not Tim Whatley.This rectangular skin growth came right off my rib skin! It was almost sickening. I had scratched off a mole! And there it was, sliding around under my shirt. Well. I couldn't let that go on for long. What if I had severed some minor blood vessels? I could be bleeding out. I'm on blood-thinners, you know. I resisted the urge to scream, \"We've got a bleeder!\" I had to determine the extent of the damage. I reached my hand up under the bottom of my shirt. Didn't feel any slime like blood. But there was the mole! I pulled it out from under the shirt to get a look at it by the glow of New Delly's monitor.It was a tidbit of diced onion.So THAT'S where that dropped morsel went as I bit into a hot dog with the works.Never mind."}, {"title": "Incident #872 Where Val Blames Hick", "date": "Monday, November 10, 2014", "text": "Darn that Hick!

Some of you may think that's plenty late enough to call someone on a Sunday morning. But not Val Thevictorian! The night owl. The darkness dweller. The woman who has always been the last to bed, and rarely early to rise, unless a job depends on it. Even as a kid, I was awake late into the night. Listening to the snores and breathing of the rest of the family.Okay. I was already up at 8:30 Sunday morning. But Hick didn't know that! And I'd only been up since 8:00. having gone to bed at 2:00. But Hick had to make sure he had me under his thumb and out of his bed. Which is where my current problem arose.Because Hick was not there to stab me with his raptor talon toenail, knock my pillow stack askew by burrowing his arm under it, blast my face with breather air, stab me between the shoulders with his pointy elbow, labor my breathing with his gaseous emissions, and, most importantly, TAKE UP SPACE...I hurt my back sleeping. My back, you see, is accustomed to the hefty sag Hick puts into his side of the mattress. Without is, my back worked overtime while I slept, trying to balance itself in a manner to which it was unaccustomed.Uh huh. It's that big muscle near my spine, above my right big buttock. Do you know how hard it is to do anything without using your back? PDH. That stands for Pretty Darn Hard. This is no joke, like that cartoon stick man on the back of T-shirts, the one holding the back stick of another stick man, saying, \"I've got your back!\" Nope. No joking matter. It's PDH to even walk around with a twinge in the back muscle above your right buttock.So what happens today at school?

I'm up here because of my phone.\" Let the record show that in the house of Thevictorian, communications are spotty at best.

Did you get some phone numbers this time?\"\"Uh huh.\"\"The old ones from the summer, or did you meet new ones?\"\"Two new ones. Well. Three. One guy goes to a school that will compete against us as Scholar Bowl in a couple of weeks.\"\"And the other two?

But I didn't, because I was sure I would spill something off my plate.\"\"How was the Halloween dance? Did other people go in costume? Did they recognize you as a Walmart employee?\"\"Yes. Some were in costume. They knew mine the minute they saw the back. For a while, I sat with Alex from Target, and Jake the State Farm guy.\"\"That's appropriate.

She told me no.\"\"And it didn't crush your spirit?\"\"No. She said she didn't like to dance.\"\"You could have told her you didn't know how, either, and you could both practice. But at least you asked. I'm proud of you. What are you going to do this afternoon? You could walk the mini pony.\"\"Nah. There's no grass for him now.\"\"There's grass right there in the front yard! Or you could practice driving your truck.\"\"Nah. My legs are sore from three hours of dancing.\"Still. Baby steps. Our little Pony is going to turn out all right."}, {"title": "The Unthinkable Val Thevictorian", "date": "Saturday, November 8, 2014", "text": "For all of you worried about Ebola wiping humanity off the face of the earth, or about zombies shambling into your neighborhood to feast on your brains...let me take you away from all that. What better way to forget your problems than to take a glimpse at one of Val's?Val is lolling about the homestead this weekend, doing what she darn well pleases. Hick and The Pony have gone upstate to a Factory Safety Meeting and a Future Mensa Reunion. You can judge for yourself which of my guys attended what.Since they were away, I had only myself to feed on Friday night. I stayed late after school, not that such a behavior is uncommon to Val, with her usually staying at least an hour-and-a-half three days per week. So it was shortly after 4:15 when I left. I have to be careful these days. Darkness falls quickly in the hinterlands, what with all those pesky hills blocking out the setting sun before its time. And darkness is very dark in the country. So I wanted to get home before dark so I wouldn't be listening for Mothman flittering about in the woods when I stopped at the mailbox row to pick EmBee's gullet clean.Nobody wants to cook only for oneself. At least not this nobody. So I thought up something quick that would not require a lick of input on my part. I called Pizza Hut for a personal pan pizza and some breadsticks. Yum. I haven't had a personal pan pizza for years. Mmm...it was going to be SO tasty! I chose beef, mushrooms, and onions as my toppings. It's hard to have a pizza how you like it around here. Hick demands only meat, including that horrid pepperoni, and The Pony will only eat cheese.So with great anticipation, I piloted T-Hoe to Pizza Hut, which is on the way home, and just the right distance for that personal pan pizza to be ready when I got there. Let the record show that my commute is around 40 minutes, not due to great distance, but due to two-lane blacktop. I picked up my personal pan about 15-20 minutes into the journey.The window woman brought my eagerly-awaited personal pan to the window in its small cardboard box. The breadsticks were in their own cardboard box, longer, and a bit narrower. The window woman foisted this purchase on me like she was part of the pit crew for Dale Earnhardt Jr. Could she not see that I was without my little helper who rides behind me? I had to reach over my purse onto the shotgun seat and try to balance these unequal sized boxes. As I was finagling them into position, Window Woman growled, \"Here!\" I turned to see her shoving a red booklet of some sort at me, and a flapping receipt. I quickly took them and tossed them onto the passenger seat.I pulled away from the window a bit so as not to impede the next pit stop, and grabbed the breadstick box which was trying to jump over the edge of the seat and land on the business end of the umbrella that has rested its point on the floor since Tuesday. I grabbed that awkward red book, and saw that it was a Pizza Hut calendar. I put the breadstick box on the seat, the calendar flat on top of that, and then my much-anticipated personal pan box on top of that. The receipt had fallen to the floor already. Not that I cared.The tantalizing aroma from my personal pan beef, mushroom, and onion wafted across my nostrils like a silken white thread of eau de PePe Le Pew in cartoonland. Only much more pleasant, I would imagine, though I never had smell-a-vision as a kid. I motored along, obeying all the traffic rules, despite people behind me taking umbrage at my law-abidingness. I was going to arrive alive. None of that speeding for Val Thevictorian. She had precious cargo perched upon her passenger seat. Mmm...that precious cargo was going to taste like the best personal pan pizza that ever personally panned.It was at the roundabout that the bottom fell out of my fantasy. Roundabouts, I am certain, are the main traffic interchange in not-heaven. Folks around here are not accustomed to roundabouts, even though my route has had two of them for nigh on four years now. You never know whether you will have to slam on brakes because young drivers speed up like they're Dale Earnhardt Jr. rather than let you merge, or, as in my case Friday evening, shoot in front of you when there's no chance in not-heaven that an opening is possible.I heard a sickening scrabbling of cardboard, and glanced right to see that my personal pan box had taken a dive over the side of the black leather seat, and was now partially visible between the seat and the door, as a$$-over-teakettle as a square flat cardboard box can be. Though I must say, the aroma grew even stronger. I still had ten minutes of my drive left. I surreptitiously glanced at my fallen feast as I had the chance. Plotting. A method to retrieve my treat before it fell to the cat-haired, bat-guanoed garage floor when I opened the door. There was no leaning over to grasp the box from the driver's seat. T-Hoe has a large console. Val has a large...um...everything. Except long arms.As soon as I pulled into the garage and lowered the door so no neighborhood weirdo could come up and startle me, I grabbed that red, green, and black striped umbrella which I had never properly velcroed back around the handle. I went around to the passenger side of T-Hoe, and laid that umbrella down on the dusty garage floor like a sterilized sheet ready to catch a just-birthed baby. I yanked open the door and reached my hand inside. The Pizza Hut calendar fell onto the umbrella. The personal pan pizza box was wedged in the slot molded into the bottom of T-Hoe's door for placing, perhaps, maps. And books. And magazines. The personal pan pizza itself was not in the box.MY PERSONAL PAN BEEF, MUSHROOM, AND ONION WAS PERCHED AT A DIAGONAL ON THE FLOOR BESIDE THE PASSENGER SEAT!Having been fresh and hot and soft when placed in the box and foisted upon Val at the window by the Pizza Hut pit crew, that tender pizza had flattened on one side like a half moon. Did that stop Val from trying to salvage her fantasy? What do you think? Val is the woman who fed her toddler half a chocolate chip granola bar off the garage floor. Don't act shocked. How dare you assume Val never gave her kids anything healthy like a granola bar!Sorry. I'm feeling shaky from reliving that nightmare. I must wrap up this horror story and let you go back to your own worries.But let the record show that my personal pan beef, mushroom, and onion pizza, though misshapen, was real, and it was spectacular."}, {"title": "Here's to Hoping That Nobody Experienced Any Shrinkage", "date": "Friday, November 7, 2014", "text": "I just got a call from The Pony. He is away at the Missouri Scholars Academy reunion. To say that The Pony has been chomping at the bit and pawing at the turf in anticipation of this event would be an understatement. To say he felt the same way about calling me would be a blatant lie. You know The Pony. He's not really all that interested in helping people, and doesn't particularly care about their feelings.The reason The Pony called, aside from the no-nonsense command of his father, was to report that he indeed had steak for dinner, as he had hoped, and that he also had LOBSTER! The Pony is not adventurous in the food department. Unless it was called a raw fish stick, and served in a sea of ketchup, I could not imagine him trying this allegedly delectable treat.\"We had steak...and LOBSTER!\"\"YOU ate lobster?\"\"Uh huh. It was chewy.\"\"Well...ordering lobster in the center of the continent is a fairly brave thing to do. It's not like it was fresh from a lobster trap Kramer pulled out of the ocean in the Hamptons this afternoon. Did you have to crack it open?\"\"It was already cracked, but we had to dig it out.\"\"Did you dip it in butter?\"\"Uh huh.\"\"I'm surprised you didn't shove the lobster aside and drink the butter.\"\"I used the butter for dipping the lobster...and bread...and baked potato.\"\"Yeah. You're still a Butterton.\"\"Uh huh. It was good.\"\"How's your room?\"\"It has a COUCH!\"\"Oh. Then you'll feel right at home, laying sideways on it. Do you and Dad each have your own bed?\"\"No. There's just one. But it's HUGE. Like a king size.\"\"Dad told you to call, didn't he.\"\"Um...no...well...he DID, but I forgot, and then he reminded me when he got out of the shower. He almost burned himself!\"\"That's your daddy! I know you want to get off the phone.\"\"Um...\"\"It's all right. It's like pulling teeth, talking to you on the phone. You can go now.\"\"Alrightbye.\"That's my little Pony. He's really excited about meeting up with his cronies tomorrow.

Let the record show that there were four contraptions built to hurl pumpkins. Three were of the same design as The Pony and Crew, and one used a counterweight.Lest the builders forget their roots, they used a bag of deer feed to weight the front of their chucker. A clever idea indeed, because after a few chucks, the machine had a malfunction. The plumber's tape sheared in half. Nobody was hurt. The team continued to fling by manual methods, which was seen as cheating by others whose machines malfunctioned and didn't think of it.There was no official winner.

I know nobody in Arizona, but that state has been calling me off and on for a week or two. So I answered.\"Hello? I am calling about your Windows computer.

Two years before that, when I voted in the November election, it rained. This evening, when I voted in the November election, it rained. Guess who's taking an umbrella to the polls in November 2016.Despite leaving school by 3:45, the skies grew dark and headlights came on. Val is no fan of driving on twisting two-lane blacktop in the dark and the wet. But she did it, of course. Because that's her civic duty. It buys her a ticket to complain for two years. Or gloat.Many of my teacher lunch table cronies were early voters. Fie on those folks whose polling place is on the way to work! Mine is in the opposite direction. So I wait until the workday is done, lest there be a delay. My voting buddies reported a glitch in the school town election hall. The ballot scanner was not working. Allegedly...it gave a message something like, \"You have already voted.\" Which seems kind of impossible, because mine was working this evening, and it even said, \"Thank you for voting.\" Not that it recognized me or anything. Nor did theirs have any idea who voted. Maybe they were stuffing that scanner too fast, like the father and son and son ahead of me who didn't wait for the green light, and the scanner choked a bit, unable to swallow, until the older son did a bit of a Heimlich maneuver and pulled the ballot back from the clinched maw of the scanner, explaining to his little bro, \"You didn't wait until Dad's was in. You have to let the green light come on.\"Hick said the scanner at our place was also on the fritz this morning. He went by there after leaving for work at 6:00. He does not have a classroom full of antsy adolescents waiting for him unattended if he is late for work. I made sure to tell Hick how to vote. Normally, I don't bother. He has a mind of his own, and sometimes we simply cancel each other out. Not that he'd tell me. He learned his lesson after confessing to the Ross Perot debacle.Anyhoo...I had to tell him to vote NO on the education issue and YES on the child molesters and also YES for 9-1-1. Not that the education issue will affect me, because, ahem, I will be retired before it will take effect. The child molester issue is a vote on whether an accused molester's previous record of convictions for child molesting can be revealed to the jury. The consensus at the lunch table was that this is too good for child molesters, the idea being that a better plan would be requiring them to be turned loose in prison to serve their time with the \"general public\" as one teacher put it. Upon further inquiry, she stated that yes, she DID mean the \"general population.\" Gotta recommend that TV show \"Lockup\" for her next time. The 9-1-1 issue puts the funding for our county system in a 3/8 cent sales tax, rather than having only the landline subscribers pay for it as a tax on their phone bill.Hick did not think the child molesters should have to reveal their previous convictions. He thinks the alleged criminal should have a right to be tried only on the merits of his current case. Whatever...you're not going to get a tableful of teachers who devote their lives to protecting kids to agree to that.So...climbing down off my soapbox...let's go to church. The church where I voted. Chapel, to be exact, as that is its name: Val's Voting Chapel. Almost. I can't reveal its real name, as it might be swamped with looky-loos who want a glimpse of Val's haunts and hang-outs. And speaking of haunts...that was one spooky spectre this evening.It was a dark and stormy night. Nowhere, a dog barked. The blacktop parking lot of Voter Chapel was full. A big dually truck was trying to back out of a space. An SUV was parked all cattywompus at the entrance, and six cars sat along the retaining wall where they would have to back out blindly onto the blacktop at the risk of cars flying over the hill to pulverize them. I went on past to the gravel lot.That parking lot used to be gravel. Now it is laced with moss and dead leaves. It's not even a regular shape. No square or rectangle or circle. Just a blob where cars can arrange themselves any which way. Three sat there under the big hickory tree. I knew it was a hickory, because even though the leaves had been rained off, some hickory nuts still clung. Then there were the fallen nuts (heh, heh, I said fallen nuts) that I trod upon as I made my way across the moss to the sidewalk in order to go around the front to the side door and the basement voting area. The dark church loomed above me, its stained-glass windows with their pointy arches mere pastels of what they must be when the light shines out. Darkness had settled in, the woods loomed menacingly along the back of the property, past an unkempt wooden shed of unknown purpose. If not for the multitude of perhaps 35 voters, it would have been an eerie setting.I lumbered down the carpeted stairs to the church basement and confronted the local election volunteers. That's how it seemed. Like my presence was an intrusion. One guy had just gone down the line, many were marking ballots at tables better suited for pot luck dinners, and the white haired hens were cackling to beat the band. The one at my end of the table, behind the book for OOPS, almost gave away my last initial, which, of course is \"T\" for Thevictorian, finally turned to look at me. Not in a friendly way. I thought it was going to be a staredown. I wanted to tell her, \"Sister, you think you know, but you have NO IDEA what I go through in a typical workday, and I could stare you down until the cows come home.\" Instead, I spoke first, in order to speed things along, and get back to The Pony sitting in T-Hoe on the undressed set of a real live horror movie.\"Do you need to see my ID?\"\"Yes.\"\"Do I need to take it out?\"\"No. Not as long as I can see the picture.\"Talk about a horror movie. I withdrew my drivers' license that nobody seems to find the least bit flattering. Thank goodness nobody keeled over when viewing my flat plastic countenance. I signed the book and was shuffled down the pushed-together tables, walking the gauntlet to get a ballot. Other cackling hens stopped when they were darn well ready in order to service my voting needs. One handed me a ballot. Another took the cap off a Bic pen, as if I would abscond with it if given the chance, requiring them all to give chase. It would have been slower than George on a Rascal pursued by senior citizens on other Rascals.The rest is history. I voted. My ballot was sucked into the scanner. I gave back my pen and snagged an \"I Voted\" sticker. The Pony had not been attacked, and no bloody hooks were found hanging from the door handles when we got home.I appreciate the suffering that came before me in order to allow me my suffrage."}, {"title": "The Silver Lining of the Raptor-Taloned, Elbow-Jabbing, Virus-Breathing Fart Cloud", "date": "Monday, November 3, 2014", "text": "The Pony is down in the dumps this evening. He has been staying after school for about six weeks now, every Monday, to work on a contraption that will fling a pumpkin. This is an activity for a new club that formed this year. They have a self-imposed deadline of Wednesday.When The Pony entered my classroom at 4:45, he was not himself. Why the long face, one might ask, forgetting that, duh, he's The PONY. He pranced to and fro. I could tell something was on his mind. He's not much of a talker.\"What's wrong? I can tell something's going on.\"\"Curly can't stay after school tomorrow, either. He has band. It looks like we're not going to get done. And it's our part that's holding everything up.\"\"You can stay until 3:45. But I have to go vote. We won't have any longer. You know we have to go way out past home to where I vote.\"\"I know. But it's not worth it. I'm the only one who can stay.\"\"Isn't there anybody else that can do your part for you?\"\"We had four people in our group. But Curly and I are the only two who ever stay to work on it, because the other two have sports.\"\"Well...you can't be expected to do everything. You have stayed every week.\"\"I know. We need plumber's tape and two holes drilled. The other two guys have shop class, so maybe they can do it.\"\"You don't need to worry about it. You did all you could.\"\"We might have had a chance if Curly brought the plumber's tape today like he said.\"\"Clubs should not make you feel bad. Don't worry about it.\"Yet he did. Because he's The Pony. He's not used to leaving things unfinished, or not having what he's supposed to have. Like that time he forgot to wear PANTS for a lab, and was nearly in hysterics, even though the worst thing to happen was that he would have to make it up one day after school. So I called my mom to go out to our house and find his pants and bring them.On the way down the hall as we were leaving today, his teacher mentioned a bunch of kids going home with a stomachache.\"Now The Pony has one. He feels bad that the only reason the pumpkin-flinger won't be done is his fault.\"\"Oh! I told him not to worry. We've got it covered.\"\"See, Pony? She's going to go down to the shop every hour tomorrow and work on it herself.\"\"That's right. I'll get it done.\"The Pony was still not convinced. On the way home, he commented that nobody had any plumber's tape. But he was sure his dad had some at home, because he'd seen it. At first I wanted to verify that we were talking about plumber's TAPE, and not plumber's CRACK. But it just wasn't the time.Hick came in from feeding his animals, and asked me first thing, \"So how did the pumpkin fling go?\"\"Shh...they didn't do it yet. And The Pony is afraid it's his fault because his part isn't done. Curly didn't bring the stuff, and they need two holes drilled and some plumber's tape.\"\"Aw. Hey, Pony! Do you need a drill? No? I have some plumber's tape over in the BARn. Let's go get it. No...you don't HAVE to walk over there with me. Wait. I think there's some downstairs.\"Hick went to the basement. No plumber's tape. He went to the BARn while I dished up The Pony's spinach & ricotta tortellini with garlic toast. Hick was gone quite a while. That was not a good sign. The Pony was almost done eating when he returned.\"Well, I guess I don't have any plumber's tape. I was thinking about running by the auction anyway. I'll pick some up while I'm in town.\"\"Before you eat? Your supper will get cold.\"\"Let it sit there.

Can't let Hick have the newest business on the block. I'm leaning towards a halfway house for nerdy teenagers. Val's School For Boys Who Can't Dress Themselves and Don't Really Care About Helping People. Perhaps you can guess my inspiration.This morning I hollered to ask The Pony if he wanted to wear shorts or pants. The temperature was below freezing. The Pony replied, \"Don't really care. Whatever you want to lay out.\" Yes. I still lay out clothes for The Pony. You might think, perhaps, \"Val! It's time to cut the apron strings!\" Uh huh. But you thinkers are not the ones who are seen with The Pony on a daily basis.Genius grew tired of my taste in clothing in middle school. By his freshman year, he was actively choosing his wardrobe during back-to-school shopping time. No Walmart fall-aparts for him. He was given a budget, and selected his gladrags online. As my mom and all the old people at church used to say, \"Genius always looks so...neat.\"Then we have The Pony. He would let me drape him in velvet and not give a hoot whether or not it was socially acceptable. He would wear clothes from a tourist who asked him to watch a suitcase and never came back. He would wear a woman's cashmere sweater with a red dot and not think twice about it. I daresay The Pony would wear a puffy shirt designed by a low-talker and not have the sense to object. He's the boy who fell off the monkey bars and hurt his butt on the first day of kindergarten, and was discovered to be wearing TWO pairs of underwear. \"You laid out clean ones with my clothes this morning, and I put them on. You didn't say to take off the other ones.\"This morning I chose a pair of khaki pants and a navy blue polo shirt. I laid them on the back of the couch, where I always lay his clothes, straight from a folded stack in the laundry room. I cut out the middle-man long ago. No need to carry those clothes to his room and put them in drawers, when I only have to go back in and select them for wearing.I put the finishing touches on my shopping list while The Pony was dressing. We gathered a pint of day-old chili, four Entertainment Weeklys, and a job application to drop off at my mom's car on the church parking lot. No, she's not looking for a job. The application was for my nephew-in-law, who just got laid off from his job in the lead mine. We had a brief discussion of whether to leave the door locked or unlocked, since Hick was Gatoring about the grounds. The Pony passed me, loaded with his burden, as I looked in the dog house for my sweet, sweet Juno. Alas, she was no doubt burrowing through the burr field behind Hick, having a grand old time living a dog's life.As I rounded the porch corner I saw it. The Pony's complete clothing selection for a morning at Walmart, with his mother, Val, who is a small-town celebrity, everybody seeming to recognize her on her jaunts, what with the 17 years and 1700 students whose lives she has touched. There he was, silhouetted against the white frost of half the front field. He had dutifully donned the khakis and navy blue polo. And on his feet, to complement this outfit, was a pair of Adidas black slides with white stripes. That is all. No socks. His toes wiggled in the wind chill.\"I can't believe you! That is NOT appropriate for Walmart.\" (Hoping he had never seen 'The People of Walmart' in all his computer-fiddling.)\"What? You always let me wear them!\"\"Yes. With SHORTS. On days that the temperature is above freezing. Not today.\"\"Awwww....\"\"Go back in.\"\"Okaaaay. I'll put on shoes!\"\"AND SOCKS!\" It never hurts to be too specific with The Pony.So...yes, I still lay out The Pony's clothes. His sartorial sense is like Forrest Gump's momma's box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get. I folded his clothes in matching ensembles for the three-week Missouri Scholars Academy this summer, and cringed to see him in pictures the week after he had to do laundry. His answer to that? \"Mom. We ALL looked like that.\" And he was right.Thus the need for Val's School For Boys Who Can't Dress Themselves and Don't Really Care About Helping People."}, {"title": "Good Shock Collars Make Good Neighbors", "date": "Saturday, November 1, 2014", "text": "Thursday evening we came home about an hour late, and found three boxers in our BARn field where the chickens like to browse. Not boxers, like muscular sweaty men with 0.5 % body fat, swinging their padded fists and clobbering the noggins of their opponents. No. Boxers. The dogs that I do not find aesthetically pleasing, nor wish to find roaming suspiciously about Hick's chicken zone.I stopped T-Hoe in the middle of the gravel road and glared at those boxers. I know they belong to the neighbors across the road. The ones whose dogs have already killed several chickens, though only one which has been admitted to. I knew they had one boxer, and that long-tailed standard poodle who invade our homestead as soon as The Pony and I drive away each morning. The two bonus boxers were unknown to me until this moment.Those dogs had the nerve to turn and look at me over their muscular shoulders, toned from chicken-chasing, no doubt, like I was the intruder. They gave me that faux surprise expression, like Jerry in George's hospital room when Elaine walked in as he was pushing the pillow onto George's face to put him out of his self-requested misery. Those dogs might as well have said, \"Val. What are YOU doing here?\" One of them was in abominable shape for a boxer. Her belly hung down nearly to the ground. She looked as if she'd recently eaten a Saint Bernard and a Great Pyrenees. Like a turducken, she was a Boxbernees. She really needs Jenny Craig. And not for a snack.I wish I had taken a picture of them standing there so insouciantly, as if they were inspecting their personal chicken herd. Then there's no neighborly denying. But I did not think of preserving evidence. I put the windows down and hollered, \"Get out of here!\" That usually works from the porch. That, and the memory of Hick shooting one of them with a paintball gun, I suppose. One walked slowly across the road in front of T-Hoe, maintaining eye contact all the way. Then he stood on the grassy strip between the road and his other neighbor's horse fence. I hollered some more. Not so much for the dogs, but hoping the neighbors would hear and call their murderers back. That didn't happen.This morning, Hick returned from his mysterious trip to town. He didn't stay long, no doubt because he has his own barbershop now. \"I seen a pile of chicken feathers beside the road, next to our buddy's horse fence.\"\"Huh. That's no surprise. The chicken killers were prowling around your BARn field Thursday night. I know we don't have near as many chickens as we used to.\"\"Yeah. I need to get a cartridge for the paintball gun. They stayed away for a while after I shot that one.\"\"You'd think the neighbors would know their killers are eating our chickens again. They always take the carcasses home. Which one did they eat?\"\"One of the white ones, I guess. It's a pile of white feathers.\"Here's the thing. Even if they didn't see their precious pets with our meaty fowl in their jaws, those neighbors drive by the exact same pile of feathers that we do. A wild predator is not going to grab a chicken, take it across the road, and rip into it in the open, where people pass by. It's going to drag that chicken into the nearby woods, out of sight. I suppose those neighbors might think our chicken looked depressed, and crossed the road to lay down and die of a broken heart, ejecting her feathers with her last exhalation. And that the white feathers on their land blew there in the wind.I know its the country. But their dogs' right to roam kind of ends when they come onto our land and eat our chickens. Other dogs make the rounds and don't eat the chickens. It's not like we didn't offer a couple of sessions with Old Shocky to make their pooches averse to tasting fresh fowl flesh.I can't imagine they would remain so silent if my sweet, sweet Juno took a bite out of their two horses every couple of months. If she did that, I would put Old Shocky around her sweet, sweet neck myself, so she would learn that horses are not snacks.What I need is a male German Shephard pup.

That\u2019s right. A left elbow intruded between my shoulderblades. That\u2019s the proximal end of the ulna poking the space between thescapulae, plural for scapula, in science teacher talk. Of course I squirmed toget away, but it followed me, that pointy implement of torture.Ifelt like a chunk of beef speared by a skewer. A maraschino cherry pierced by aplastic sword. A cocktail weenie stabbed by a festive red-cellophane-frill-tippedtoothpick. Like a cube of day-old bread impaled by a fondue fork. Like a whaleharpooned by a\u2026well\u2026a harpoon. Thatprincess with a mere pea under her stack of a hundred mattresses had nothing tocomplain about.WhenI dared voice a complaint, Hick denied that his bony protuberance was incontact with my thinly-padded spinal column. He then moved the offendingappendage, rammed it under my pillow stack, and denied that it was there. \u201cMyarm is NOT under your pillows. Your pillows are on my arm.\u201d Hick would arguewith a guy when he stumbled and accidentally stuck his chocolate bar in theguy\u2019s peanut butter. I can hear it now: \u201cNo! YOU got peanut butter on MYchocolate!\u201d There is no arguing with Hick when he\u2019s in denial. But that doesn\u2019tmean I can\u2019t try.\u201cDuh. I KNOW my pillows are on your arm.

But now he has four walls decorated on the inside.You've already seen Wall 1, it of the no-fireplace mantel and baseball memorabilia. Now Hick has added two chairs. I suppose that's his waiting area. Notice that he is starting out slowly. Just taking the overflow from his Saturday barbershop frequented by bald men who sit around chewing the fat and rabble-rousing when an impromptu road rage fight finds its way onto the parking lot.Next, he has Wall 2, the lighter and spoon wall, which I hope does not speak toward any strange drug-preparation ritual. I doubt Hick would even know of the uses of spoons and lighters in the drug culture. But avid reader and chock-full-o-culture Val does. Don't ask. A lady reveals nothing. Didn't you retain your lessons from A League of Their Own?The mirrored wall, or as I fondly call it, Wall 3, reflects that St. Louis Cardinal mantel. I suppose that mirror came from an auction, or else from my grandma's house. Looks like this is where Hick will park his barber chair, with counter space for his tresses-trimming accouterments. Perhaps those are cubbies for cups for customers' shaving cream. Not sure about that. But very sure that Hick has never read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, so this is not an ode to Johnny Nolan's shaving mug.And now for Wall 4, my personal favorite, the fisherman's wall. I am especially partial to those fishing lures hanging near the ceiling, some of which may be my grandpa's and my dad's. Or else they are just auction baubles with the audacity to give me a feel-good vibe. Watch out! Looks like we've got a flying fish, ready to swoop in and pluck Hick off that ladder if he has a spell of vertigo.That's the grand tour. I'll let you know when the city officials arrive for the ribbon cutting. Maybe Hick will sell hot dogs off Gassy G, and find an old earthenware jug he can fill with lemonade so folks can take a pull, a snort, a swig...and pretend it's moonshine. I'm not going to push that issue. Hick brought home some real moonshine from Asheville, North Carolina. Yep. Carried it right on and right off the plane in a 20 oz. Mountain Dew bottle. That was before the strict regulations. The Little Barbershop of Horrors has no liquor license, so it will serve no alcoholic beverages.I think the next order of not-yet-business if for Hick to scout those auctions for a\"We're Open!\" sign."}, {"title": "The Ladies Take Over the Barbershop", "date": "Wednesday, October 29, 2014", "text": "We\u2019vegot UNRULINESS, blogfriends.

We\u2019ve surely got UNRULINESS. Right here in Barbershop City.Right here! Gotta figure out a way to close down that future den of iniquity!Oh,dear. Where to start. Hick has been working night and day\u2026well\u2026evening andweekend day\u2026on his precious barbershop. I have fresh pictures, but you'll have to wait until tomorrow for them. Because right now, you must hear of Hick's latest barbershop adventure.When we last convened, Hick had painted the front wall red and set up a mantel with no fireplace, a mantel dotted with St. Louis Cardinal memorabilia. That left him three bare walls to contend with. But in Hick's mind, that was only three walls left to decorate with man-things for my barbershop. So he got to furnishing his newest labor of love.Last week, Hick came stomping in the front door at quitting time. Oh, not quitting time after work at his day job, which he should be keeping, I tell him, rather than thinking we can exist on the proceeds of his pipe dream. No. It was quitting time from decorating his barbershop.Hick was agitated that day, my friends. Agitated, like a hipster doofus in a dented motorcycle helmet after an encounter on the street with the former boyfriend of a gal with a big wall of hair and a face like a frying pan, Crazy Joe Davola, the Pagliacci fan, dressed as the tragic clown.\"My barbershop is full of them! Ladybugs! All over the place! There must be five thousand of them! They're down my collar, up my sleeves, in my hair...all over me!\"So of course he came straight into the house to virtually shake himself like a wet dog, spraying ladybugs throughout our homestead. At least that's what I pictured upon hearing his lamentations from my dark basement lair. That's the last thing we need. An infestation of ladybugs to rival those in my mom's drop ceiling, which don't seem to bother her, since they go back into their hideaway after crawling around on the walls and windows all day.So far, I've only seen one, near the ceiling, on the master bathroom wall by the shower. If only Hick hadn't chopped up those mice in the ceiling light vent fan, they might have eaten any ladybugs that get in the attic. Nah. That's just wishful thinking. Mice don't eat ladybugs. And of course Hick is going to chop up every mouse he gets a chance to behead in a bathroom ceiling light vent fan.I find a certain symmetry in the fact that five thousand LADYbugs invaded the MANcave barbershop that Hick is decorating."}, {"title": "Only Two Things Come Out of Backroads: Fears and Peers", "date": "Tuesday, October 28, 2014", "text": "Tap tap tap. Is this thing on?Greetings, jury of my peers. I address you tonight while stillreserving the duties of judge and executioner for myself. No need to give up apower position to mere peers, when I can keep it to use for my advantage.I stand before you to present my case. A case of goodintentions that took a twisting turn. Please refrain from passing judgmentuntil you have all the facts. On the surface, this may appear to be a case ofdereliction of duty. But I shall show you otherwise. Please excuse me for amoment while I slip on a long white wig. Because I can.All right. Get your quill pens and your parchment paper ready.I plan to show that the behavior this morning of Val Thevictorian did notviolate any statutes regarding the care and instruction of high schoolstudents. Her intentions were good. The instinct to protect her charges isstrong in this one. Don\u2019t let the fact that Spiderzilla ran unchecked throughher classroom sway your opinion on Mrs. Thevictorian\u2019s fitness for teaching.Let\u2019s begin with the pertinent information.At approximately 10:25 a.m., Mrs. Thevictorian observedan arachnid the size of a 50-cent piece skittering across the floor, betweenher own desk and the second row of student desks. Mrs. Thevictorian\u2019s firstinstinct was to KILL.Having nary a vintage pump sprayer of insecticide, nor apocketful of lizards, birds, wasps, or scorpions\u2026Mrs. Thevictorian did what anyselfless protector of empty vessels yearning to be filled with knowledge woulddo, and jumped into action. She grabbed a Puffs With Aloe, sprang to her feet,and took three quick strides across the brown speckled industrial tile to stompthe intruder and scoop him up while the students, in the dark, watching aninstructional video on volcanism, were unawares. Only to gape in horror asthat eight-legged Kennedy-head-coin-sized interloper scampered out from underthe sole of her intended instrument of death and scurried right toward theclosest student, who was tapping his heels with the excess energy ofadolescence. The prey darted under one pistoning heel. Mrs. Thevictorianinhaled the deep beginning of a huge sigh of relief, only to watch her foeshoot back out with not a hair on one of his eight legs harmed.Mrs. Thevictorian had two choices. She could scream, \u201cSPIDER!\u201dand risk injury of her charges as they leapt from their chairs, perhapstoppling them, ramming their growth plates against the bottoms (heh, heh, Isaid bottoms) of their desks. Or she could slink back to her desk, Puff stillclutched in her hand, so as not to be noticed hovering behind the anticipated spider-squishingpupil in the dark like a stalky creeper. She chose the latter.Spiders, after all, roam through people-populated areas all thetime. It is not their modus operandi to crawl upon a human and sink their fangsinto flesh. That is their defense mechanism. Spiders don\u2019t eat humans. Humans eat spiders. At night. As they sleep with their mouths open. So thestudents should be fine with a spider on the loose. Right? And if it\u2019s spotted,an outcry will arise, and Mrs. Thevictorian will have another chance to be ahero.No harm. No foul. Everything\u2019s right with the world. Studentsand spiders may occupy the same space with without issue, because they don\u2019toccupy the same niche. They should be able to peacefully coexist. Right?Case dismissed. Mrs. Thevictorian is free to leave.Oh. Excuse me. You\u2019re the jury.

Uh huh. I was sure you'd say, \"Yes.\" Even though you don't live with him and see his obsession first-hand. Well...he's at it again. The Cardinals memorabilia mantel in his Little Barbershop of Horrors has scarcely had a chance to gather dust, and he's off with a most scathingly brilliant idea.I was on my way home this evening when I got a text. I had The Pony read it for me. Val is not one of these over-the-center-line drivers who can't keep their hands off their phone in the car. Hick had discovered, at 4:00 p.m. when I was in a meeting, that one of our school buildings is for sale. I didn't see that text until 4:37, after the meeting. Val is not one of these I'm-so-important-that-I-can't-turn-off-my-phone teachers at the faculty meeting. I sent back a message that I was NOT interested in buying one of the school buildings. Jiminy Christmas! I'm retiring in slightly less than a year and three quarters, at which time I will have no desire to be the owner of a school building.Hick was so excited that I could hear it in his text, read in a monotone by The Pony. \"It's only $75,000, and I already have 100 ideas how to use it.\" Woe is me. That man of mine is almost too much to handle sometimes. Willie Shoemaker in his prime would have had difficulty reining in my Hick. As I dictated The Pony my reply, HIS phone rang.\"We're on the way home now! It's Dad. He says he has 100 and ONE ideas how to use the school.\"\"Let me talk to him. There's no way we're buying a school.\"\"Here. She wants to talk to you.\" \"I couldn't hear what she said. Val? VAL?\"\"We are NOT buying the school. I don't care how much it is. We're not buying it.\"\"It's only $75,000!\"\"That IS kind of cheap for a school. But no way am I going to get involved. You could please 99 people with your project, but then one would have a fit and make a stink because HE went to school there, the first one ever to graduate in his family, and that school should be preserved as a shrine. People don't want the building sold or torn down. They want it maintained. As a shrine to their glory days.\"\"But I know what we could do with it. It's already had new windows put in, and the asbestos removed. The kitchen downstairs, with the cafeteria, would be a great place for wedding receptions!\"\"Nobody wants to have their wedding reception in an old school!\"\"You'd be surprised. People have them in a lot nastier places than that!\"\"I can't see it.\"\"And downstairs, where that friend of yours who sold the guns had his classroom...that would make three apartments down there.\"\"I'm not renting out rooms in my school. It might be worth the $75,000 just for the furnace and the fixtures and the scrap.\"\"Heck, I'd pay 'em $35,000 just for the gym. It has the kitchen and cafeteria, and all those lockers.\"\"You could probably sell the chairs in the gym for quite a bit.\"\"I know! And...\"\"WAIT! We are NOT buying the school building. It's not worth the headache. People in the community don't want it sold.\"\"Well, that doesn't include the new part with the shop and the music rooms and the offices. They want a hundred-something thousand for that.\"\"Yeah, well. We're not buying any of it.\"Oh yeah. It's not like we would buy the school and kick all the kids and teachers out. We're getting a new building. The ground has already been broken.Sad thing is...I really think Hick was serious. But once I walk out the door and start my forever vacation, I am not interested in re-entering those hallowed halls of academia in any fashion. Not even as a landlady or party promoter."}, {"title": "A-Shiverin' In Me Timbers!", "date": "Sunday, October 26, 2014", "text": "When we last convened, Val was returning from town on a special Friday off work, having narrowly dodged the Hick-stays-home bullet that so frequently pierces her solitude when the Hickster gets advance wind of her mini vacation.The time was 12:45, when Val would normally be spouting off about the commensalism form of symbiosis, where one organism benefits and the other is neither helped nor harmed, as with the example of eyelash mites in the follicles of humans. But not today. Today Val's heart raced not with the excitement of ecosystems and the fine tightrope balance required amongst organisms and their environment, but with apprehension over the sight she beheld in her BARn field.A TRUCK WAS PARKED IN FRONT OF THE barN!Let the record show that Hick's truck sits near the BARn, and his $1000 Caravan sits near his truck. But they are farther from the BARn, more towards his freight containers hidden in the fence row, which he plans to turn into a storage building for odd autos and 4-wheelers. This truck sat insolently between the fire pit where Hick burns refuse to obtain scrap metal, and the pen where the goats and mini-pony frolic.No truck should have been in our BARn field. So Val did what any self-respecting country spouse would do, and vowed to get to the bottom of this trespass incident. What if somebody was planning to steal two lawnmowers again, out from under the BARn lean-to? They already got our two non-working lawnmowers. I'll be darned if they're going to get the working one without a fight. Besides, what was I supposed to do...sit in the house, peeping out the mini-blinds, waiting for that truck to leave, or for somebody to break in? It WAS a workday for the rest of the world, you know. Nobody supposed to be home here.Perhaps you remember Val's apprehension every time that unmarked white truck carrying the ginger-bearded \"meter-reader\" shows up and that dude tromps across the porch. We are not located on a beaten path, but ensconced upon 20 acres on a dead-end gravel road. Val has not forgotten the time the sheriff's deputies blocked off access to her homestead for several hours due to an abandoned portable meth lab a half mile down the road. Nor the more recent investigation of the headless body found in a septic tank a half mile up the road in the other direction. She is well aware of the remoteness of her surroundings. When seconds count, the county deputies are just 30 minutes or more away.I drove up the driveway, not following the tire tracks of that truck that went through our ditch and into the field. I pulled off into the front yard, and called The Pony to put on shoes and meet me in T-Hoe. The BARn is about 100 yards from the house, with a bit of woods and the animal pen in between.\"See that truck over there?\"\"Yeah...\"\"Was it there this morning when you fed the animals?\"\"No.\"\"I didn't notice it when I went to town, either. So it must have got there within the last hour or so. We're going to see who it is.\"Yes. That's Val. Sitting on an armory stockpiled with firearms, yet knowing how to use none. Taking with her The Pony, a creature only slightly less helpless that a newborn kitten. The vigilantes were on the case. Val and her posse of one. Let the record show that The Pony wore flip-flops. Yet even that fact did not bode well for Val, who didn't have to be able to outrun the intruder, but only The Pony.I drove across the yard and onto the gravel section of faux road that Hick has in front of his Little Barbershop of Horrors. We approached the truck, dark green in color, with a crew cab, tinted windows up, but no driver in sight. There were two large styrofoam soda cups in the holders. Perhaps The Pony and I were outmatched.Neither of us had seen this truck before. Hick's oldest son, Sonny, sometimes comes out on the weekends to help him build stuff, or let his kids pet the mini-pony. But he has a white truck. Like that ginger-beareded so-called meter-reader. I looked around for people. None. No sounds. I drove along the side of the trespassing truck. Turned back to get the license number. And saw that the plates were from Texas.\"Did The Veteran move back to Missouri?\"\"I don't know.\"\"Does he have a truck like this?\"\"I don't know.\"\"He hasn't been out here in over a year. I thought he was still in Texas. Your dad hasn't said anything about him.\"\"That would be the most logical explanation.\"\"I know. Why else would a person with a Texas truck even know this place was here?\"\"Yeah.\"I think The Pony was just glad there wasn't going to be a rumble. We drove back up through the field, around the main sinkhole, and back onto the driveway. I parked in the garage and started carrying out groceries. The Pony took them from the porch into the house. My sweet, sweet Juno was nowhere to be found, no doubt bonding with our intruder. I gave her arch nemesis, Ann, both shares of cat kibble. Actually, I put out a big pile for Juno, and a little pile for Ann, but Ann hogged it all. You schmooze, you lose, Juno!\"Need any help?\" It was The Veteran, Hick's second-oldest son, walking across the front yard.\"No. I think we've got it. Now I just need to put it away. I think The Pony's coming out.\" The Pony had told me, on his next-to-last trip to get the groceries, that he saw The Veteran over by the chicken pen.\"Yeah. I just stopped by to say hi.\" He had his two little girls with him.\"Sorry, it's been a long week, and I've got stuff I planned to do today.\" I went inside to put up the food and start my next load of laundry and set out The Pony's lunch, and mine.Let the record show that Val is not as heartless as she appears on screen, and that she has no beef with The Veteran. Let the record also show that Val abhors drop-in visitors, values her privacy, and looks forward for two months each fall to this conference-week day off with grand plans for leisurely writing.I sent a text to Hick after I got the household duties under control. Funny how he had sent me one while I was in the garage, and hadn't had time to check.\"Are you having a good day off?\"\"No. It's a good thing I didn't call the sheriff when I found a strange truck by the BARn. It's a good thing I don't know how to shoot any of your guns. And it's a good thing I don't pass out from hypoglycemia, because it's 2:00 and I still haven't had lunch. And no, I am not having a good day off.\"\"I didn't think you'd even know he was on the place.\"\"You might have thought to warn me in case I heard something. Or saw a strange truck. He says he stopped by to say hi. Funny, what with this being a workday, and me supposed to be gone to school.\"\"I told him he could come out and see the animals, but your name never even came up.\"\"That's odd. If I was at work, he wouldn't have stopped by to say hi. I bet you couldn't wait to get on the phone this morning to tell him to come out. You always find a way to intrude on my days off. You've never even told me he was back in Missouri.\"\"I didn't know. Until today.\"There's something fishier than Fishy McFisherson about this story.

Because if you are, you may want to sit over there under that tree and have a frozen lemonade rather than risk the ups and downs and twists and turns of today's story.Friday was a hard-earned day off from school, since we stayed late for conferences two nights that week. I know I told Hick that I was off. I told him last weekend, when he didn't get T-Hoe's gasping tire fixed so that it doesn't lose five pounds of air a week. So when Hick claimed, on the bed-edge, after waking me from a deep slumber at 6:00 a.m. on my day off, that he didn't know I was off, I begged to differ.I didn't argue strongly, because hey, he didn't know, so he hadn't taken the day off to be with me like he always does, on every day off, ever, to horn in on my free time. I even managed to go back to sleep, probably something to do with getting home at 10:30 the night before, what with picking up The Pony at his Halloween dance. By the time I did a load of laundry, opened the mail, wrote out some bills, and made a shopping list, it was going on 11:00. I jumped in the shower and left for town. The Pony elected to stay behind and lay on the basement couch playing computer games. Shocker there...My town trip was fairly uneventful, though somewhat informative, because the Save A Lot clerks were all a-twitter with news that one of them had come up short yesterday! By a whole dollar! They were castigating an employee who was not present, agreeing that when OTHER PEOPLE are on your register, you can't really be held accountable. I slid my debit card through the dealy-bobber, much to their relief, and they were so grateful that they cautioned me, \"Don't use your debit at Dairy Queen! A guy was in here yesterday, and his identity was stolen, and he had to get a whole new card, and the bank did an investigation, and it happened at Dairy Queen!\" So I told them about Genius's identity theft, and the problem it caused with our taxes not being able to file electronically. We do that, you see, in Backroads. Bumpkins helping bumpkins. Maybe I should start a fundraiser for that, and stand outside the gas station chicken store with an empty ice cream tub, and collect money to help with cash register overages for my gals.I picked up the Hardee's burger that The Pony had requested for lunch, and some chicken tenders for myself, and headed back to the ol' homestead. Time was ticking away on my precious day off. It was now 12:45, and I still had to put away the frozen groceries, toss in more laundry, and wash a week's worth of dishes that my nonexistent dishwasher had so callously ignored since Monday night. I think Hick was about to get creative like the Hecks on The Middle when they gave Mike's dad their old dishwasher that contained all of their dishes, resulting in Axl drinking soda out of a measuring cup, and Frankie serving coffee in a tall glass boot to an old lady applying to be Aunt Edie's caregiver. I could imagine Hick with a grout trowel, trying to skim some No Sugar Added Blue Bunny Banana Split Ice Cream into his mouth.So I was a little preoccupied as I drove up our gravel road, nearing home, passing in front of the field wherein looms the BARn. Something caught my eye. You know how your subconscious notices when things are amiss. And...WHOOPSIE! Too long. You'll have to come back on Sunday evening to see what Val saw."}, {"title": "I'm Surprised He Hasn't Applied To Drive the Wienermobile", "date": "Friday, October 24, 2014", "text": "Hick has the nerve to claim that Val doesn't cook, so much as she warms food in the oven, or heats it up in the microwave.Let the record show that Val is actually a genius, what with managing to warm that food with only one working oven element for nigh on 365 days, and having to open her microwave door with two hands, one on each of the drawer knobs that substitute for a long, curved ACTUAL microwave door handle. Compared to Hick, Val is a 5-star Cordon Bleu master chef.At his advanced age, and spending time batching it between wives, one might assume that Hick knows his way around a kitchen. Au contraire. One would only be making an A S S out of oneself and me. Hick is what you might call a Wiener Chef. Maybe not you. But he's what I call a Wiener Chef. Or just a wiener.The full range of Hick's culinary repertoire extends from the wiener to the weiner. Some calls it a hot dog. I calls it a wiener. And if you know what movie quote I'm parodying, I've got some biscuits and mustard for you. Mmm hmm.Even before we were married, Hick relied on his wiener. His boys would come for the weekend at his apartment, across the parking lot from my townhouse, and he'd fix them wieners. His secret recipe was one package of wieners, one saucepan, and tap water. Give the Wiener Chef a blue ribbon, because he always served up the meal on a glass plate. Yep. He'd set that plate of 8 wieners in the middle of his kitchen table, for himself, his 5- and 7-year-old sons, and his 10-year-old stepson. You can imagine how fraught with danger such a meal was, what with those boys not having much to munch on between weekend visits, and possibly being taken on one of Hick's never-ending rides and missing lunch. A fork is a dangerous weapon when you're only 5 years old, with short arms, and starving, longer-armed people stabbing for sustenance.It's not that Hick didn't have more than one package of wieners. He was a workin' man, with a regular paycheck. The other pack of wieners was for breakfast, cut up in the scrambled eggs and dusted with garlic powder. On the positive side, Hick's boys never had to fight off a vampire.When we married, Hick sometimes cast aspersions on his old high school friend who lives on the land next to ours. \"He is so lazy that his wife mows the yard. That's about three acres. And she works full time at Walmart.\"\"Yes. But he DID buy her that riding mower.\"\"He told me one day that he about starved to death between the time he got off at 3:30, and she got home to make him supper. 'I just laid down on the couch, I was so weak.' He didn't even have the sense to open up a can of soup.\"Like Lucky Ned Pepper declared to Rooster Cogburn, I must say, 'I call that bold talk for a one-eyed fat man!' Because Hick has never made himself a can of soup, even though soup is plentiful in our pantry. Must be his aversion to the 'runny' part of soup. He waits for me to make it so thick he can stack it over the edge of the bowl. But he can whip up a wiener like a champ.Lately I have been taking wieners in my lunch. That's because they're quick. And when you only have 22 minutes for lunch, quick is a plus. I buy the giant packs at Save A Lot. But a couple weeks ago, it seemed like my wieners were running low. Even though Hick was fed a proper diet of oven-warmed, microwave-heated meals, I fear he was skimming wieners. I mentioned that I needed three more wieners to get me through the week, and there were only four left in the pack. Hick became indignant, blurting that he DID NOT sneak wieners! Still. I finished the week with not a wiener to spare. I have a feeling Hick will also deny sneaking those Kraft American Singles, of which there was a whole pack last time I checked, and then only two left last week. And to think that I used to blame poor innocent Genius for being the cheese thief.Yes, Hick's gastronomical proclivities are skewed heavily toward wieners. He'll eat them on buns, he'll eat them on Nutty Oat Bread, he'll eat them on the chicken bread languishing on the countertop for two weeks. When I was in the hospital in May, I'm pretty sure Hick survived on wieners. Thank goodness my mom took care of The Pony.Don't you worry about Hick running out of wieners and starving to death. In a pinch, he will devour wieners' bastard cousin: baloney."}, {"title": "The Man Who Would Be Sausage King", "date": "Thursday, October 23, 2014", "text": "The workday starts early in the Thevictorian household.

I buy Hick his sausage/egg/cheese biscuit or muffin every week. They come 8 in a pack. So after a while, we have enough for the work week without buying. They don't all fit on his shelf in Frig's freezer door. That means I have to get creative. I put the extras on the freezer door shelf below. Hick is a creature of habit. \"Biscuit here. Banana there.\" That's his breakfast every day.Let the record show that Hick has gone without a banana because they were on the cutting block in the center of the kitchen, right by Frig, and not on the counter by the door, beside the sink. And that no matter how many bananas I buy and put on the counter by the door, beside the sink, there are always just enough until Friday. If I buy eight bananas in a bunch, three mysteriously disappear on Sunday. If I buy five, all are there on the counter by the door, beside the sink, until the last one is used on Friday. It's uncanny.So here was Hick, bellowing about his sausage biscuit. \"I know you have enough until Friday. Look on the bottom shelf.\"Then commenced such a digging, with rustling sounds such as might be heard if Little Lotta sprang to life and traipsed across my kitchen in dungarees made of shower curtains, that I was sorely tempted to give up on the last five minutes of my chair nap to investigate. \"WHAT are you doing?\"\"I'm looking for my sausage biscuit, Val.\"\"On the bottom shelf, right below where you get them every morning.\"\"Oh. I found one.\" He also dumped a couple Hot Pockets on the floor for good measure. That man purely enjoys his morning thumping.The thing is...Hick has tunnel vision. There is only one place for his breakfast foods, and if they are not in that place, he might starve to death.Don't get me started on his hot dog self-made meals."}, {"title": "Me Walk Pretty One Day", "date": "Wednesday, October 22, 2014", "text": "Oh,dear. Val is unbalanced again.Itall started in class yesterday, on that wonderful day of days, the late parentconference night. Not that the parents are late. They show up right on time, assoon as our ordered-in supper has been removed from the bag and set before us.No, it mainly started with a headache, which may or may not be related to theanticipation of being at work for 12 hours.Assoon as first bell rang, I headed for the hall to supervise young \u2018uns rushingto class. On my way, I carried some assignments that needed returning to someformer absentees. One young lady came in as I was headed out.\u201cOh,here are some papers that I handed back while you were absent.\u201d Of course Iheld them out, and expected her to grasp them and continue to her seat. Butsince we are working with kids, our expectations are never fully realized. Shecontinued to her desk all right, like a homing pigeon returning to its home.And stood there. Expectantly.Farbe it from Val to dash a young girl\u2019s expectations. I turned to foist the papers onher, had to lean a little bit, because she was rooted to that desk likeyoungster holding his place along a parade route with a Walmart sack waitingfor candy. As I reached and leaned, something inside me snapped. Somethinginside my left knee, to be specific. Sad situation when reaching and leaningare equivalent to an iron man competition for Val Thevictorian.Asthe day progressed, that knee practiced tricks. I could be strolling along,minding my own business, thinking I was going to put one foot in front of theother without even thinking. Knee had other ideas. Like collapsing as anovertired toddler might do in the middle of a hardware store, becomingboneless, or doing the \u201cdead dog\u201d as my brother-in-law the ex-mayor used to saywhen his kids were toddlers. So I grew cautious, and stepped gingerly.Thismorning I could barely walk. The one not-so-bad knee was now the bad knee,making the former bad knee the almost-as-bad knee. You can\u2019t limp when bothlegs want to debate who is weakest. So I made my way through the house likeFrankenstein learning to walk. Like a sweet potato in a root experiment thatescaped its plastic cup, teetering about on toothpick legs. Like Babe Ruth(less the 12 hot dogs and 8 sodas that he consumed between games of a doubleheader) waddling toward home plate. Like Hick stumping around on ankle boneswith no feet, which is how he sounds walking overhead when I\u2019m in my darkbasement lair.Thebones of my knees felt like one big mortar and pestle, grinding a light bulb tosmall shards. WAIT! I can\u2019t do that. I take it back. For the love of science,knee joints are not like a mortar and pestle! That would be our friend the hip,with its ball and socket. No, my knee joints felt like two pestles grinding alight bulb to small shards. You know how chicken bones have that smooth whitecartilage at the ends of the leg and thigh bones? Mine is like shreddedcoconut.Ofcourse my doctor says this has nothing to do with my blood-thinner medicine.Like I\u2019ve been virtually unable to walk all these years, not just since Istarted that poison at the end of May.

But only at the Terrible Cuts frequented by Val Thevictorian.ThePony and I stopped in Sunday morning after our weekly shopping excursion. Ishould have known something was amiss when I saw the diaper laying on thewaiting chairs. Yes. A diaper. Not a dirty diaper. Not one of those disposablesthat clogs the environment. Nope. A cloth diaper. Of the kind one might tossover a shoulder for burping purposes. Burping an infant, of course. Let\u2019s hopeno adult has burps of such magnitude that a catch-all is required. I turned toThe Pony. \u201cYou can sit over there by your diaper.\u201d He was not amused.ThePony has never been attached to a cloth diaper. That was Genius. He used acloth diaper as his security blanket until he was about 2 years old. Yeah.Maybe I had a hand in that. After all, when the object of his affection grewdirty, I switched it out with another. Easy peasy. Genius called it his \u201cine.\u201dHe might possibly show up on My StrangeAddiction someday, confessing that he loves the taste of bleach, because heused to chew on that \u201cine\u201d mercilessly.DiscussingGenius\u2019s toddlerhood peccadillos is not rendering my hair any shorter. Butfunny thing is, neither did getting myhair cut!Asluck, or Even Steven\u2019s grand plan, or the conspiring universe would have it, Iwas called for the first haircut. The Pony cooled his hooves far from theabandoned diaper. I should have known I was in for a Twilight-Zone-episodesquetreat when The Cutter asked if I was letting my layers grow out. I assumed shemeant my hair layers, not the ever-expanding adipose layers that make Val herzaftig self. Since this was the same cutter who cut me at my last cutting,shouldn\u2019t she have been able to discern layers where layers should have been?And not assume that I was growing them out like old-lady Cher, to one lengthsuitable for sitting upon?TheCutter said, \u201cOh, you want an inch off?\u201d Normally, I tell them 1-2, but sincetelling them an inch means they hack off a mile, I nodded. You know. One lastchance to move my head before the slashing started. And that\u2019s when it gotweird.Iknow The Cutter cut off cuttings. Stuff fell to the floor. It could only havebeen my tresses. I don\u2019t think cutters carry throw-downs like cops, just toprovide evidence that they have actually cut off some hair for the payment. TheCutter pulled down on the bottom strands. Compared in the mirror to see if thecoiffure or my head was lopsided. Then she asked how I comb my bangs. At leastshe didn\u2019t ask IF I comb my bangs. \u201cDo you normally comb them over to the sidelike this?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThen TheCutter proceeded to slice from my bangs a hank the exact thickness of a gnat\u2019s wing,while they were swooped over in a tasteful alignment that favors my lovely lady-mullet.Except that no cutter ever, in the history of cutting, including this cutterthe last time she cut me, has ever trimmed my bangs with them combed in mynormal manner. The cutters always pull some hair up on top of my head, and combthose bangs down straight, using my eyebrows, which are starting to favor thoseof the late Andy Rooney, as a benchmark for trimming. Apparently, there hasbeen a policy change in the manner of cutting bangs at Terrible Cuts.Iswear, when I looked in the mirror at home, after the frou-frou blow-outcomb-out had wilted on my head, I could not tell that my hair had been cut. Inthe shower the next morning, it actually felt LONGER than it did the daybefore. How can that be? In what bizarro world is hair longer after a haircut?Only in Val Thevictorian\u2019s world, it seems.Sohere I am, parading my lengthened hair for all to see at parent conferences. IfI don\u2019t have many visitors, I am going to begin working on Val\u2019s Theory ofCut-a-tivity. There has to be a reasonable explanation.

Like svelte,ink-piddling Cabbage Patch Dolls. I had no idea until yesterday, when I boughtadopted the newest additions to my writing family, a package deal of ebonyoctuplets. Little was I aware that their foster family, the PaperMates, had anagenda. And that the little squirts had a story:The InkJoy StoryOur mission was simple: To develop arevolutionary ink system that would give you the best in effortless writing. Wewanted to give you a pen that starts quickly without dragging, requires minimalpressure from your hand, and delivers crisp, clean lines every time. But mostof all, we wanted to bring back the joy of writing, so it felt right to call itInkJoy. We hope that you feel the joy whenever you write with an InkJoy pen.Share your InkJoy experiences with us at papermate.com to receive specialoffers.Yeah. Right there on the back of the package. And it\u2019s also in French: L\u2019histoire de InkJoy.Iwill admit that those octuplets are smooth. Not that I write with them all atonce. But here\u2019s the catch. They are\u2026how you say\u2026um\u2026not wanting to send theminto the throes of anorexia\u2026a bit on the portlyside. I am used to those clogging, recalcitrant WriteBrothers. Thoughstick-thin, they leave a bit to be desired in ink joy. Their ink is as clottyas Val\u2019s blood last May.Onething I\u2019ll say for those WriteBrothers: they wear a cap well. In fact, theircap lends itself to other uses, notably being to dig into one\u2019s ear when there\u2019s an itchthat a pinky-finger can\u2019t reach. It\u2019s like an extra-long, pencil-thin bill ontheir cap. The InkJoys, on the other hand, wear a cap like Gilligan. It\u2019s jammed onto their penheads with noappreciable sticking-out-ness. The clip-on part of the cap is flat, and laysalongside the cap itself. No jutting out for ear-reaming. And that clip had alittle flare at the end, like That Girl Marlo Thomas\u2019s hair flip.But getting back to the stockiness of these husky InkJoys...they are a handful. Hard to grip. Val is not a ham-fisted giant, fee-fie-foe-fumming all willy-nilly throughout the livelong day. She has normal hands. The smoky clear hard plastic is difficult to grip. It feels like three sides, but actually has six sides, with a little bevel between each of the three main surfaces. Val does not want to grip a prism while she writes. Her wrist tendons are screaming out with carpal tunnel syndrome every time she picks up one of those big boys.I will not send back my new octuplets. So they're a bit hefty and thick, and not good for excavating ear wax. They have a story to tell, by cracky!Yeah.

I mostly chow down and clam up, not wanting to stir the pot, content to simmer silently and release my steam later. I sometimes nod in agreement. Add a pertinent fact, as long as it's something they could sip from the well of common knowledge, nothing robust that might leave a bad taste in their mouth.It all started innocently enough. Somebody sipped coffee too quickly and coughed. Then another offered that the worst pain she ever had was when she took a drink of her piping hot coffee and sneezed some out her nose. And I saw an opening. A chance to contribute. Did I tell the story of my own high school lunch table, when I, the future valedictorian, sat across from an albino who laughed so hard at my joke that she shot a chili bean out her porcelain nostril? No. I did not tell that, because I feared that somebody might find such a tale off-putting. I did, however, use the moment to educate my dining companions on a recent bit of news from the world of science. Because I'm a giver like that.\"Hey! Did you see that story in the news yesterday? This lady went on vacation to some tropical country, and she kept having nosebleeds. She was kind of worried, but she didn't want to ruin her vacation. It wasn't a lot of blood, just a couple of drops here and there. She saw a little blob of congealed blood up in her nostril, kind of peeping out, but she did not want to dislodge it in case that would start a worse nosebleed. So she just left it alone, didn't pick at it, snorted it back in. As soon as she got back from vacation, she went to the doctor, and he pulled a 3-inch leech out of her nostril. He said she must have had it for about a month, and it kept getting bigger and bigger.\"Well. You can't imagine how un-sciency and uninformed my colleagues are. The coffee snorter looked at me in pained horror. The dude who chews open-mouthed and rolls that food around on his tongue like a hot dog on a 7-Eleven Big Bite warmer closed his mouth and frowned at me. The gal who alternates meals of Ramen and Brach's Chocolate Covered Peanuts looked at me like \"WTF?\" And the one on my left who once squirted a tomato all over my shirt cupped her hand over her mouth like she might be refunding her lunch.Seriously. I sit at that table and listen to their tales of their kids vomiting and how pink slime is used in fast food hamburgers and worm protein is in Taco Bell meat, and I don't have a conniption. Let the record show that only the worm-protein-cryer nodded that she, too, had read that story. It's not like I said that woman ATE the leech that the doctor pulled out of her nose. I don't know why they have to get all squeamish about nature.I've half a mind not to share the scientific breakthrough in feces transplants. Did you hear? NOW the loose-boweled patients can take their feces transplant in a frozen capsule form.

The grand opening has not yet been announced. There was, however, some activity in the interior decorating department.Apparently, Hick is going with a SPORTS BARbershop theme. I don't know where he got his memorabilia. I haven't known him to seek it out on eBay like his Falstaff stuff and beer trays, or even his Coca Cola oldies. Maybe he got his balls (heh, heh, I said balls) as promotional items at the games. He gets free tickets from his vendors. Not as many as he used to, because somebody made a new regulation (about 10 years ago) that any freebies had to be entered into a drawing for ALL employees, even though they don't deal with the headaches of jobs gone wrong or bringing things in under bid or making sure errors are remedied at no further cost. C'est la FREE, I guess they say...Hick made The Pony take this picture and send it to me. \"What do you talk about in a barbershop? Sports and fishing!\" I have not asked if another wall will be devoted to fishing. Or why he didn't tape off his corners when he painted the wall red.

She might just put off breaking ground on that proposed handbasket factory for a couple more weeks.I arose early on my Saturday, just like last Saturday, for The Pony. No biscuit-and-gravy breakfast this morning. Nothing official. The Pony wanted to use his grandma's high-speed internet to download a computer game he bought last Wednesday. It has 14.8 gigabytes, according to him, though I wouldn't know a gigabyte if it took a bite out of my gigabutt. Since he had his bowling league at noon, I dropped him off at Mom's house before I really wanted to be out of bed.To treat myself on the way home, after running in Walmart for soup starter mix, and dropping in Save A Lot for hamburger and vegetables, I cashed in some winning scratch-off tickets at Casey's General Store. They're not my usual lottery-ticket trading place, but they're my number two ticket trader.As I started out the door, a man and teenage boy came in. The boy stopped, went back out, and held the door open for me to exit. He was probably 15-16 years old, taller than my Pony.\"Thank you.\"\"You're welcome, ma'am.\"There was a time when I would have been incensed that he called me ma'am.

You can tell by the lack of a cell wall and chloroplasts. I find the rough endoplasmic reticulum particularly appealing.The whole project had to be edible, which explains the cut marks for serving it up to his classmates. Real animal cells do not have their cytoplasm divided into rectangles.When Genius did this project several years ago, he used a big cookie as the base. The Pony asked his grandma to make him her famous Rice Krispie Treats with peanut butter and a hard chocolate icing. At first leery that she might cause an untimely death, Grandma made The Pony swear that no kids in his class or using his desk have a peanut allergy.The Pony reported that his Cell Krispie Treat was a rousing success. And that once upon a time, a kid had created his cell with a slice of white bread and raisins and mustard and ketchup, and other organelles not nearly so tasty as Kit Kats and Rollos and Twizzler Bites.The project only cost me $25.

I know that's hard to believe, Val Thevictorian being less-than-enamored with those very special Millennials, so different from Val and her ilk at the split-end tail of the Baby Boomer generation.Today at the teacher lunch table, a very special Millennial mentioned that she had a male student who whipped up his pie filling and said proudly, \"Ms. Millennial, I feel like Betty White!\" Of course she needled him a bit, informing him that he most likely felt like Betty Crocker, of cookbook fame, not like Betty White, who was an actress on The Golden Girls. The rest of the table got a chuckle out of that, especially the other very special Millennial, who declared that Betty White is one bad old lady, what with being in that Snickers commercial playing football.So several conversations ebbed and flowed around the table, and in a lull, I told very special Ms. Millennial, \"That's kind of ironic, since Betty White played a cooking show star on The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\" I don't really know what ironic is, remember, but I felt it sounded pretty smart there at the lunch table, with only one Communication Arts teacher among us to correct me.Well. You would have thought that I'd sprouted another head, like Rosey Grier and Ray Milland in The Thing With Two Heads, the way she looked at me. Let the record show that four other folks around the table smiled and nodded and said, \"Hey, that's right.\" But very special Ms. Millennial was discombobulated. \"I don't know that that is.\" So a Generation X-er explained, \"She was more like a Blanche on The Golden Girls.\"Seriously. That's what you get for trying to contribute. Two very special Millennials yukking it up that they never even heard of that show. C'mon. It's part of pop culture. Sure it doesn't run on cable and satellite like The Golden Girls. But I daresay their parents or grandparents had surely seen The Mary Tyler Moor Show. How could they deprive these very specials of knowledge of such a treasure?

She has her standard causes to which she donates yearly. Sometimes TWICE, if she forgets that she gave, and those greedy nonprofits keep sending her begging letters. I don't mean to appear parsimonious, but there are times when I am unwilling to give.Take that weekend before Labor Day weekend a while back. I pulled T-Hoe into a parking space at Voice of the Village. A 44 oz. beverage was calling my name. Since that was all I planned on purchasing, I only took my refill cup and the 80 cents I picked out of my change bin.As luck or Even Steven with an axe to grind would have it, I was accosted by a beggar the minute I rounded T-Hoe's front bumper and stepped foot on the sidewalk. This was no ordinary beggar. No unkempt long white beard, no stocking cap, no fingerless gloves, no feet wrapped in rags. Nope. It was an urchin beggar.Let the record show that it WAS the last weekend of August. So Urchin Boy was clad in the unofficial uniform of all male Backroads youth, those scraggly stretched-out shorts your older brother won't wear anymore, a misshapen white t-shirt with no slogan, and ripped-out sneakers that had most likely spent half the summer in the river. Urchin Boy ran up to me and thrust out a bucket. \"Would you like to donate to Muscular Dystrophy?\"\"I'm sorry. I only have this change I'm spending on a soda.\" I strode past his receptacle before he could offer a counter-argument.Here's the thing. I'm not so sure Urchin Boy was really collecting money for Muscular Dystrophy. He was not alone. There was a mama and papa and several other urchins, and their apparent friends, all standing out front taking up most of the sidewalk for Voice of the Village. Not one of them had on a t-shirt that might identify them as official collectors. There were no banners or signs on the building. The containers were not marked. I'm sure they had permission from whoever was in charge of Voice of the Village that day. But that doesn't necessarily make them official collectors for the MDA.I'm not trying to be snobby. Just cautious. If you say you're collecting for a well-known cause, you should probably have a collection receptacle that is not the same shape and size of those gallon opaque plastic ice cream tubs for generic dairy treats, with a ragged rectangular hole cut asymmetrically in the lid.Just sayin'.I bought my soda and dashed back to T-Hoe while Urchin Boy was approaching somebody coming the other way. Could I have spared some lottery ticket money to donate? You bet. But I kind of like to know where my money is going. If you want it for bail money, for school clothes for your kid, for a night at the casino, for a heapin' helpin' of heroin...just be honest. Or entertaining.You never know.

They do not enjoy a good cafeteria meal like they used to. I haven't had one in several years. Maybe longer. Time flies when you're having fun, you know. My personal reason for not having the school lunch stems from a bait-and-switch tactic upon which I look with disfavor.Back in the day, a teacher lunch cost $1.75. I know, right? Highway robbery. Even though we all managed to gain weight on our $1.75 per day. You couldn't fatten a steer for that! Not that any beef would be found in our cafeteria. Teachers are funny bunch. We expect a white tablecloth, good silver, fine china, crystal, finger bowls, linen napkins, and a waiter with a towel over his arm, all for a reasonable price of one dollar. That's what we expect. But we make do.Sometimes, one is willing to forgo certain inconveniences for the right perk. So if the menu advertised an entree I detested, such as fish shapes, which were referred to by their eaters as \"breaded bread with a fishy aftertaste,\" yet promised one of my favorites for dessert, such as chocolate cake...I was right there allowing that $1.75 to be deducted from my lunch account. But as bad luck and Even Steven would have it, one such day I went through the lunch line, after waiting for all the kids to pass through, because Val is many things, but she is not a cutter, even though school protocol allows such a benefit to the faculty, and discovered that THERE WAS NO CHOCOLATE CAKE! Even though I had smelled it baking all morning. Clever, those cooks, to rig up some kind of chocolate cake batter candle to fool me. Not a single solitary soul in that cafeteria had chocolate cake. It was vanilla pudding, the kind that comes in a five-gallon can.So...I washed my hands of the school lunch line, and vowed to never eat a school lunch again. Well. Unless it's the Thanksgiving turkey chunks and mashed potatoes and some kind of pumpkin dessert thingy. But I doubt we'll ever see that again, because now everything has changed. That's right. We're not here to talk about why Val holds a grudge against the school lunch ladies. We're here to talk about what The Pony observed today in the cafeteria.First of all, let the record show that I have first lunch, and The Pony has third lunch. Many items can change in that span of time. But today, they didn't. We had vegetable soup and green beans (because obviously we need more vegetables than what's in the soup) and a wheat roll and fruit. My lunchtime companions sat down, one with a full tray, one with a bowl of soup, and the others like me with their broughten lunches which may be a Tupperware of pot roast and veggies, or might be a large bag of chocolate-covered peanuts and a Coke. You never know with that crowd.Anyway, I noticed that the \"roll\" was not a roll at all, but two long wheat breadsticks, whereas yesterday's roll was also wheat, but was the size of a Grade A Large egg. Almost. But yesterday was Salisbury steak (heh, heh, STEAK, they call it) and that tiny roll and mashed potatoes and carrots that looked suspiciously like they had a verboten glaze on them. But getting back to today's meal, my left-hand luncher opened her pack of two crackers and said, \"Wouldn't you know it! They're WHEAT!\" And not like Wheat Thins, apparently, because she took a bite and said, \"That tastes like cardboard.\"In fact, that's the opinion of most kids. You'd think they're being served assorted colors and shapes of cardboard. It's so bad that they actually eat their apples and bananas now, instead of throwing them away. I asked The Pony, a lunch-bringer himself, if he knew that the crackers for the soup were wheat.\"Of course I do. You know, don't you, that I eat lunch with people who get a tray!\"\"Yes. But I didn't know if you paid attention to what's on the tray.\"\"I did today, because one of the guys had an extra cracker, and he said, 'Here, want this?' So I smelled it, and it smelled like dog food, but it actually wasn't bad.\"\"Wait! It smelled like dog food, so you tasted it?\"\"Uh huh. And it was okay.\"Baby steps. Make them hungry enough, and kids will eat the food allotted to them.

You can see the spread at 1:17 in this clip. Watch fast! Then you're back to gruel. But even that would be a treat for Val, after the way this day turned out.Yes, not only was Val not served a banquet, she was instead served a crap sandwich. WAIT! That's too delicious to describe the plate set before Val this morning. Ha! Who am I kidding? There was no plate. Not even a thin, non-absorbent school-issue paper towel. Nope. Val was served up a dollop of crap on a cracker. Not even a Ritz, mind you, but a Hi Ho found under the back seat of the car three years after the child no longer needed his safety seat.It all started with my aching knees, who have decided to rebel from their shopping trip through Walmart yesterday, or their ups and downs with the laundry, or the stock-still statue impersonation during the preparation of the cauldron full of potatoes, sausage and cabbage. Or it's just that darn blood-thinner medicine being extra efficient, filling up my joints with thin blood after the normal wear-and-tear. Or the weather has made my knees a more accurate predictor of low pressure systems than the TV weathermen.Whatever the case, I could hardly make it down the four porch steps to the garage. I though I was going to need a rescue chopper to lower a metal basket and strap me in and winch me down to sidewalk level. So painful that I might have let out a whimper, which made my sweet, sweet Juno poke her rubbery black nose into my face without even prancing towards the cat kibble. So painful. Even sitting in T-Hoe's soft leather seat made my knees hurt. But that was not my only issue this morning. It's too bad Hick can't poop out headlights for T-Hoe. Because he still hasn't gotten me that one he said he ordered, only put back the old one he took out because it was foggy. So this morning, as I backed T-Hoe out of the garage, The Pony suddenly came to life and did something that might have been construed as helping people. Shh...don't tell the ACT interest inventory. I'm not about to go through those seven pages again to update them.\"Hey. Are both headlights working?\"\"I don't know. It looks funny. Get out and run around and check.\"\"The right one is out on the top.\"\"What's that supposed to mean?\"\"The yellow part works, but the white part doesn't.\"\"Thanks. Take my phone and text Dad. Tell him that NOW the right headlight is out.\"Well, when it rains, it pours. You should know that from the Morton salt girl. As we rolled at a high rate of speed (BUT LEGAL!) down the old road to school, nearly to the park, actually, mere miles from my building, the dashboard lit up with flashing warning lights. Where there used to be the SERVICE SUSPENSION SYSTEM light that's been on for several months, a half-tire blinked on and off in cheery orange color.Val is no automobile simpleton. She knew right away to push the button to check on her tire pressure. Faithful followers might remember how the left front tire loses three pounds of air a week. So The Pony puts it in at the convenience store for me. I hit the button, and that tire was fine. Only two pounds down. So I hit it again for the rear tires, which you may recall have been having an issue, what with the sensor telling me the left tire is the right tire, and the right tire is the left tire. Makes it kind of confusing to order The Pony around at the air pump.Now that sensor told me that my left rear tire had 35 pounds of pressure, and the right rear tire had -- pounds of pressure. Seriously? Who has -- pounds of pressure in their tire?Of course I thought the thing was flat, even though there was no wobble, and here I was almost to school, where T-Hoe had to sit on the parking lot all day, getting flatter and flatter in his right rear. Or would he? Maybe it was the LEFT rear that was actually flat! So I pulled off at the only gas station in town, which, by the way, has NO air pump, and made The Pony inspect tires. He reported they looked like they always look. So I went on to work and drove home and pretty much told Hick to get me a manual tire gauge for The Pony to use every day.Sometimes, I think we might as well be back in the good ol' days, when people kicked their tires to see if they were inflated properly.

My typing is not up to par, what with my arm hurting from patting myself on the back.I had the most scathingly brilliant idea to whip up a pot of sausage, cabbage, and potatoes for supper. I started hacking up the ingredients (let the record show that it was hacking in the manner of chopping items into smaller pieces, not hacking in the manner of expelling a lung with a cough, or hacking in the manner of stealing personal information from secure accounts) this afternoon. I let that rib-sticker simmer for a while. All that I needed this evening was a tray of Jiffy corn muffins. Surely you don't think Val bakes from scratch.Around 5:50 p.m., as I was stalling in the recliner before ascending to the main level to start my muffins, reality got me in a headlock, gave me a noogie, then tweaked my nose. We had not a single drop of milk in the house. It's not like I can send The Pony down to the corner market for a gallon. Nor can I send him out to milk a goat. I did, however, order him to get on the internet and see what we might have that can substitute for milk in a corn muffin recipe.Huh. Little Mr. Biscuit-Gravy Stirrer was of no help at all. First, he claimed that his internet was not working. Such a coincidence, after working all day and night continuously, even when mine is down occasionally for the cloud cover. Finally, he said that there was absolutely nothing that could substitute for milk. And that, specifically, I should NOT try water.So I did what any milkless woman in a corn muffin crisis would do, and called my mom. \"Oh. Some recipes say to use milk OR water. No? Do you want me to go upstairs and look in my Betty Crocker cookbook? Okay. Stay on the phone. I'll pick up in the kitchen...Are you there? This says you can use condensed milk to replace one cup of milk, at the rate of half a cup of condensed milk and half a cup of water. Do you have condensed milk? Okay. It says you can use evaporated milk. Oh. Or it says you can use powdered milk...\"\"Mom. If I don't have real milk, I sure don't have condensed, evaporated, or powdered milk. That is not really substituting. That's just adding water to already-milk. I don't know what I'll do. I think I'll try sour cream. It comes from milk. I'll use half sour cream and half water. Thanks anyway.\"So I tried it, and it worked. The corn muffins came out fine, if slightly less dense than when made with milk. You know what I want to say? \"That's it. I did it. I'm a miracle worker.\" Yeah. I totally stole that line from the scene in Not Another Teen Movie when Mia Kirshner transforms Chyler Leigh from an ugly duckling into a beautiful swan. Okay. She's not really a bird of any kind. But she goes from hideous to date-worthy by removing her glasses and taking her hair out of a ponytail. Here's the clip, but be forewarned that there is gratuitous profanity in the beginning.Now I need to write to Betty Crocker and let her know that her red-plaid-covered cookbook is in need of an update. I'll bet she has people to answer her mail."}, {"title": "You Can Lead The Pony to Gravy, But Someone Has to Teach Him to Dish It Out", "date": "Saturday, October 4, 2014", "text": "The Pony had to work at a biscuits-and-gravy fundraiser this morning. You know what that means! Val and her mom strapped on the old feedbag for biscuits and gravy.Let the record show that The Pony knows less about these fundraisers he's involved with than the Secret Service knows about White House intruders. I could barely get his work hours out of him in order to determine whether he could still make his bowling league. The sum total of his knowledge was: \"Nine to eleven, four dollars, three biscuits.\" The wild card was whether sausage was a component of the gravy. He said he had not heard sausage mentioned. He also divulged, at the last minute before we pulled into the parking lot, that he didn't know where the gravy was coming from, but that his sponsor bought the biscuits at Walmart, and the kids would be baking them in the oven in the school kitchen.Let the record further show that nary a hairnet, cap, or plastic glove was seen. Not that Val is concerned about such sanitary measures. After all, on The Amazing Race, people in India eat food from street vendors that has been sitting around all day in the sun with flies crawling over it. And drink beverages from re-used plastic 7-Up bottles. So I was not concerned about contracting dysentery from a student fundraiser. Even though just before reporting for duty, I made The Pony pick up a piece of clear tape that had been stuck to the floor of my classroom for three days, and was beginning to turn black from the foot traffic.\"Mom. You know I'm going to the kitchen now to serve biscuits and gravy. Do you really think that's a good idea?\"\"Yes. Because I won't have to bend over. Now get the Germ-X and wash your hands.\"My mom met us there in my room. She's kind of an odd duck. Not that you'd ever believe something like that, of course. We had called her on the way, because the thought hit me that my mom could not eat THREE biscuits with gravy, and she hates to waste anything. So I told her to bring a container for leftovers. In she walked, after KNOCKING on my classroom door, opening it a crack (heh, heh, I said CRACK) and asking, \"Is this door locked?\" Then she put her re-used Walmart sack with a plastic container on the first desk, and proceeded to the back corner by my mini-fridge, opposite from my desk, and catty-corner from The Pony's desk, to sit with her face toward the wall. Odd. Duck.The record grows longer, because it must also show that I was reading the tabloids so I could give them to Mom when she left, and The Pony was fiddling with his phone to kill time until his shift.\"Mom. You don't have to sit in the corner.\"\"Well, I just wanted to leave you alone until we get our biscuits and gravy.\"\"Oh, I need to get out my four dollars. I hate to use my ones, but they may not have change.\"\"I was going to buy your biscuits and gravy.\"\"You don't have to do that.\" I was willing to give up my Four-Dollar Daughtership for the day, seeing as how Mom only donated THREE DOLLARS to the same club for their Alzheimer's walk last weekend. If the elderly and addled aren't worth more than three dollars, it's hard to believe the Val's appetite is worth four.The Pony left to start work. His soft whiskered nose was out of joint because I \"made him\" ask if we had to pay for the concurrent volleyball tournament in order to enter for the breakfast. The answer was no, which was good news for Mom's pocketbook. Even so, as we went up the hall and turned into the cafeteria, the secretary working the ticket table hollered to ask if we were going to watch volleyball. Times must be tough. Gone are the days the ticket-taker never even made my family pay when we went to watch games.I walked up to the table with the money box and a disinterested senior texting obliviously. The Pony stood by the entrance to the kitchen. \"You get a juice or a white milk or a chocolate milk with your plate.\" The big cooler inside had the top flipped back like a piano key lid.\"Well, I'm going to check the dates. I work here, you know.\" Insider knowledge is a good thing. I tossed my four dollars to the texter and went inside. I was lucky to find a chocolate milk half-pint with Oct 15 stamped into the top. Then the senior dishing up the biscuits and gravy asked me if I was half or full.\"What?\" Seriously. What kind of question was that? In fact, I told him I didn't understand, and he had to repeat it twice. Finally, he got his point across.\"Do you want a half-order or a full-order?\"\"Well, I paid four dollars...\"\"Oh. So you're a full.\"I looked at the sponsor. \"I though he was asking me if I was an optimist or a pessimist.\" I took my plate, and added some pepper. Then the sponsor asked if I wanted jelly. JELLY! What kind of person eats jelly with biscuits and gravy? I took two.In came my mom. She said she was a half-order.\"What? You paid four dollars!\"\"No. I just paid two dollars. When I walked up to the table, the boy said, 'I bet you want a half-order.'\" Which kind of makes me think they assumed, 'Here's Mrs. Thevictorian, that cow, who will polish off a full order.'Let that increasingly obese record show that they were correct. Mom and I took our plates back to my room. There she further informed me that she had asked the texter if I already paid, because SHE had wanted to buy my breakfast, and The Pony assured her, \"You don't have to pay for Mom to eat.\"The food was just right, my compliments to the chefs and the dipper, who had EXACTLY the right ratio of gravy to biscuits, with just enough bare edge sticking out to apply two tiny packets of strawberry jelly. The milk, however. left a bit to be desired, being absolutely tasteless, yet with an aftertaste. I took two sips to give it a chance, then chucked the rest out my classroom window. Not the waxy brown carton, of course, just the no-fat milk. Seems like only several years ago, the last time I ate a school lunch, that we had the pleasure of tasty 1% chocolate milk. Ah. The good ol' days.Mom had taken a half of a half-pint of real orange juice from concentrate. Being a retired teacher herself, she pried that spout open, pried it farther, and swirled that beverage around before trying a sip.\"What are you doing?\"\"Well, I want to get a look at it first.\" Funny how we insiders are so suspicious.As of this moment, neither Mom nor I have suffered any gastrointestinal upset. The fundraiser was declared a success. The Pony got to eat his fill of leftovers.The Pony announced that he received a bit of a promotion with 30 minutes left of the breakfast. \"I got to move into the kitchen instead of standing by the wall telling people about the drinks. My job was to stir the gravy so it didn't get hard, and to dip up the plates when people came in. At first, two of our own workers told me I didn't put on enough gravy, so I started putting on what I thought it should be, and half again.

We take a winding two-lane blacktop route past the lake, over the tracks, down a long curvy hill, over some more tracks, past the shooting range, over the river, and through a residential neighborhood.We caught up with a slow green SUV between the tracks. By the time we crossed the river bridge, a line of four cars had piled up behind us. The slow green SUV actually started scooting along at 40 mph in a 30 mph zone, going up the long gentle hill though the neighborhood. I kept an eye on the traffic behind me. You never know. Like this morning.A guy on a motorcycle came flying out from behind all those cars. He must have been going 65 or 70 mph. VROOM! VROOM! VROOM! He made sure all of us six cars knew of his displeasure as he blew past us. He wasn't quite straddling a crotch rocket, but neither was his hog a Harley Davidson tricycle. It was really more of an off-road kind of bike.Let the record show that this guy was not your typical motorcycle rider. He was a bit rotund. No leathers for him. He was wearing a shirt and light jacket that flapped in the wind. His tail-wind, one might term it. Because it flapped his shirt and jacket, leaving nothing to the imagination about his tail. As he passed, I was treated to the sight of his enormous fish-belly-white buttocks jouncing jollily under the overcast sky. His sans-a-belt slacks, after sans-a-belts ceased to be cool, did little to impede the unencumbered buttocks. Where are the police when you need them?Somebody should have thrown the book at him, with the understanding that it might become wedged in his canyon-like crack and never be seen again."}, {"title": "But What About the Children...'s Hair?", "date": "Wednesday, October 1, 2014", "text": "Hey!

No auction meat. No black-with-white-speckles roasting pans. Nada. He did, however, buy his barbershop a kerosene heater for six dollars. SIX DOLLAR HEATER? I hear you all shouting that like the \"New York City?\" salsa cowboy. Yes. Hick is putting a six dollar kerosene heater in his barbershop.\"Six dollars? There must be something wrong with it. You'll all die of carbon monoxide.\"\"We're not going to die of carbon monoxide, Val.\"\"Don't be so sure. Every combustible form of heat gives off carbon monoxide. Even a wood stove. And I believe your barbershop is a tin shed with no windows, and a door with two doorknobs. I don't see any chimney out there. Where is that carbon monoxide going to go? Besides into the lungs of you and your non-paying customers and the health inspector?\"\"I'm thinking about getting one of those doors with the built-in window. Then I'll have some light in there, and a way to look out.\"\"But it doesn't open. Carbon monoxide isn't going through the glass.\"\"We'll be fine. I got a new chair, too! It was only a hundred dollars.\"\"You already HAVE a barber chair! Down in your safe room.\"\"The one with the wooden seat and wrought iron? That's a shoeshine chair, Val. Not a barber chair. But I do have another barber chair up in the BARn loft. It's more of an old beauty shop chair. With that lever you use with your foot to pump it higher. Here's my NEW barber chair.\"\"You've got to be kidding me! That's not a barber chair! It looks like a Mickey Mouse chair. See the ears?\"\"Well, it might be a kid's barber chair! I wondered why it didn't have a head rest.\"\"Barber chairs don't have headrests! How are you going to get to the hair? Wait! The guys who go to the barber shop don't have much hair. I guess that explains it.\"\"No, Val. The headrest is adjustable, so you can have something to hold your head when you get leaned back for a shave.\"\"Oh. We don't do that where I get my hair cut.\"\"Yeah, and I wondered about that foot rest, too. It seemed kind of small. Now I see it. It does look like ears.\"\"Where is that?\"\"It's over in the BARn workshop right now. Until I put it in the barbershop. I might put in a drop ceiling.

Genius was only here for the day. He left that half-full jug of pink lemonade on the cutting block. That Monday morning, as I was getting The Pony's lunch ready at 5:00 a.m., I smelled the film developer. At first I though it was just a left-over smell in the kitchen. But every time I moved near the cutting block, it was stronger. I saw that lemonade, and sniffed the white plastic lid. OH YEAH! The poison was strong on that one. I grabbed a paper towel so as not to contaminate The Pony's lunch, and then grabbed that evil lemonade jug and dropped it in the trash, the paper towel following it.The next morning I noticed the smell again. Huh. Right around the cutting block. Darn that Genius! He must have had his hands all over it, and must have set his jugs of chemicals over there, too. Every morning it was the same thing. I'd get a whiff. Strong. Near the cutting block. Poor Pony. Now I was slowly poisoning him by putting his metal water bottle on the cutting block to add ice, and compounding the crime by setting his sandwich container there just before inserting it into his lunch bag. Not to mention his mini bag of Cheetos that I tossed onto the cutting block from the pantry until time to pack the lunch bag.Short of sanding that six-inch-thick slab of butcher block until it was a mere sheet of laminate, then sealing it with a clear coat, I don't think there's a way to get film developer chemicals out of a thick wooden cutting block.Yesterday morning, as I packed The Pony's Cheetos, a wave of guilt washed over me like the very strong whiff of film developer chemicals. Huh. Funny how it was so much stronger now, even after a couple weeks went by. I sniffed that Cheeto bag. WHEW! That was almost overpowering. I got a damp paper towel and wiped it. I really had to get to the bottom of this. I leaned over to where the Cheetos had been laying. Maybe I could cover up that area so food didn't come in contact with it. That's when I saw it.PERK ABSOLUTE ZERO CAR VENT AIR FRESHENER!Somehow, I had received a free sample of Perk in the mail, in a small manilla envelope. I never ordered it. I let that envelope languish on the kitchen counter by my purse for a week or two. I thought Genius had ordered some tiny gadget. Then The Pony said, \"Uh. It's addressed to YOU, Mom!\" So I let him open it, and it was the car vent air freshener little plastic thingy, in shrink wrap on cardboard, about the size of a quarter. You know. Suitable for hooking onto your car vent.When Genius was here for the day, I asked him if he wanted the air freshener thingy for his truck. \"Oh!\" Genius loves free stuff, now that he has to pay. He opened it and sniffed it. \"No. You can have it.\" He laid it back on the cutting block, among the paper towel holder, The Pony's comb, two mini plastic bats full of gum that he didn't want, a bag of tortilla chips, and a college recruiting postcard for The Pony.Last night, Genius called to ask if I would pay for a new magical graphing calculator that will prevent him from doing calculus or some advanced brainy math stuff by hand. Since he has his tuition and room and board covered with scholarships and his RA deal, and owed $-1,843.00 this semester, I agreed. I told him how I was glad he was still able to function after imbibing all those film developer chemicals.\"WHAT? I didn't drink them!\"\"I think you did. You should have smelled the lid on that lemonade.\"\"You're ridiculous!\"\"I even had to pick up the jug with a paper towel and throw it away so I could quit poisoning The Pony every morning when I made his lunch.\"\"Heh, heh. Now THAT'S funny. Poisoning The Pony.\"\"Well, he's fine. But you'll never guess what I figured out this morning. It was the air freshener thing you opened and left on the cutting block!\"\"Heh, heh! I knew I didn't get chemicals all over the cutting block.\"\"You must have touched that air freshener when you opened it, and had it on your hands when you drank the lemonade. That smell was strong!\"\"Yeah, well. I like how you were poisoning The Pony!\"At least that made him happy. Genius had his nose out of joint because I did not write enough about his visit. It's not like he still lives here and can compete with his dad for my material.No wonder he didn't want that air freshener!"}, {"title": "Somewhere, Between High Rollers and Pot Heads, Lies Val Thevictorian", "date": "Monday, September 29, 2014", "text": "A frown to the left of me, a toker to the right...here you are stuck in the middle with Val.Walk with me, won't you, into the Casey's General Store on Sunday afternoon? Yes. Soak in the ambiance of Backroads. A crisp sunny day, blue sky, temps in the low 80s, folks out doing what Backroadsians do on Sunday afternoons. Which means a treat of lottery tickets for Val, after a hard day of grocery shopping.I walked in with four winning scratcher tickets, totaling $25, to cash in for more tickets. That's the way you win, you know. Amass some winners, then play off your winnings until they're gone, then wait several months before trying again. When you're hot, you're hot, and when you're not, you're not. Somebody oughta write a song about that.So there's one line with only one register open, because the other clerk is kneeling behind the counter making a money drop. You'd think they'd wait for a lull and not expose the floor safe to every ne'er-do-well in Backroads, but times have changed since I did a stint behind a Casey's counter.The lady in front of me stepped up and asked for two rolls of quarters. She wasn't buying anything. Just wanted quarters. Let the record show that she was perfectly willing to part with a twenty-dollar bill to get her two rolls of quarters. But, as the clerk explained, the employees are not allowed to give out change like that on Sundays. Neither are they allowed to pay off big lottery tickets, either. Not that I've ever taken one in there, of course. But they usually ask me how much mine are worth before taking them. As long as you're just taking your profit in tickets, it's not a problem. It's those pesky banks that keep banker's hours that make Casey's so stingy with their coins and bills on Sunday.Now what does a lady need two rolls of quarters for on Sunday? That's 80 quarters. Nobody does that much laundry. And casinos take bills. What was she going to do, stuff them in a sock like Sean Penn did with cans of soda in the original Bad Boys movie, and whack a bully across the face? Or twist them in a towel like a bar of soap like Matthew Modine did in Full Metal Jacket, to whack a clumsy screw-up in his sleep for getting the whole platoon punished? I think not. She got all frowny-faced when she found out no quarter rolls were coming her way.Then it was my turn. But the other clerk jumped up from behind that counter like a jack-in-the-box, and asked if she could help anybody. So the dude behind me stepped over and said, \"I only want to buy some Zig Zag papers if you have them.\" Well of course they had them. They're a convenience store, aren't they? It would have been mighty inconvenient if Dude couldn't get his rolling papers. To complicate matters, the clerk told Dude that they had both red and white Zig Zags. Not something a toker like Dude wants to hear, because then he has to make a decision. When all he wanted was to step up to the counter and get his rolling papers and get the not-heaven out so he could roll his...ahem...cigarettes...like a cowboy ridin' the range.Dude didn't know the difference in red and white Zig Zags. He said he'd take the cheapest pack, but alas, they were both $1.68 as discovered by the clerk when she practice-rang them up. Then she told him the red ones were smaller. I never did hear what Dude decided to use for his tobaccy of the wacky type, because I had to pick my tickets. Quite successfully, I might add, because when I got home, I scratched off a $40 winner.Just a slice of life from Backroads on a Sunday afternoon."}, {"title": "The One Where The Pony Picks Up Two Chicks", "date": "Sunday, September 28, 2014", "text": "Last evening, just before The Pony left with Hick on the way to the auction on the way to his walk-a-thon, I heard the front door open.

I could picture him and his red ponytail wreaking havoc upstairs with that Mayhem Allstate Insurance dude and the Maytag man who sits under the counter licking dishes.

Look what Dad and I found when we collected eggs! They were just born. One of them was still wet on the head from pecking out of the egg. The mom won't accept them. She tried to peck them. She already had one chick yesterday. I guess she only wanted one kid.\"He held a chick in each palm. One yellow, one black. They continued to CHEEP up a storm. Maybe that gets their lungs going. The yellow one pecked at The Pony's thumb.\"How are you going to take care of them? They'll freeze to death tonight. It's going to be in the 40s or 50s. They need to be up under the hen.\"\"I know. Dad's going to put them in his barbershop. He ran a light bulb in there to keep them warm, and we'll put them in a tub on some hay.\"\"Do they have food and water?\"\"Uh huh. But the food is too big, so tomorrow morning Dad is getting some regular chick feed.\"\"Some of them drowned in the water dish one time. Will they fall in?\"\"No. It's one of those little waterers, with a dish at the bottom that the water comes out in. Shallow.\"\"I hope it works. They'll die anyway without the hen.\"\"I know. Aren't they cute?\"The Pony was practically beaming. I'm surprised he didn't hand out cigars. He really enjoys the critters.This morning, Hick texted The Pony that he checked on the chicks, and \"They were pretty rough.\"\"I don't know what he meant, but he didn't say they were dead.\"The Pony and I went off to do the shopping, and Hick's oldest son came out with his kids to ride four-wheelers and see the chicks. According to Hick, the chicks were still and cold. Sonny picked them up and blew on them and held them in his hands, and they opened their eyes and started CHEEPing. So the men did what all men would do, and put those two chicks in a tub in the sun to warm up, and went off riding ATVs. When they came back, the chicks were deceased.\"Well, they probably got overheated in that tub in the sun. It was 84 degrees! They couldn't even get a breeze down in there. They can't regulate their heat. You gave them heat stroke.\"\"We might of.\"\"Poor things. They didn't stand a chance. Have you told The Pony yet?\"\"No. Hey! Pony! The chicks died.\"\"Which ones?\"\"The newest ones.\"\"BOTH of them?\"\"Yeah. We thawed them out, then we cooked them. We tried.\"\"Aww.\"RIP, little Ivory and Ebony. We didn't even have time to name you. Sorry that the food you had overnight was bigger than your beak, and that hay and a lightbulb don't hold in your body heat like the wings of a hen.

However...non-drivers can't be choosers, only beggars of rides.This particular fundraiser is a walk for Alzheimer's Disease. The Pony had a sign-up sheet for people to pledge per-mile amounts, or donate flat sums. He has had this form since the last club meeting day, which was three weeks ago. The Pony is not exactly a go-donation-getter. He didn't even ask ME or Hick if we would like to donate. In fact, I bought magazines from another kid in his class because The Pony never asked me about that fundraiser, either. I told The Pony that Hick and I would donate $20 for Alzheimer's. He doesn't even have to walk for three hours.The Pony may not be one to wear out his shoes gathering donations, but he is generous to a fault. I told him that his grandma would probably donate, and his aunt, and his cousin, if he only asked. He said, \"I'm going to donate $25 myself. I can afford it.\" He can. Money doesn't mean much to The Pony. He has a stash of saved allowance and birthday money and science fair winnings and Voice of Democracy Speech Contest first and seconds.Yesterday we took my mom along for the ride on bill-paying Friday. She looked forward to it all week. She wanted a Rally's combo for supper, which she got for $1.99, making sure I used a coupon. Mom even sprung for The Pony's combo, and handed me $5.00 for frozen custard.As Mom was trying to force-feed me Rally's fries, even though I declined because I had a frozen custard, and The Pony strapped on the feedbag to devour his cheeseburger...The Pony had a flashback to his upcoming fundraiser responsibility.\"Oh, Grandma? We're having a walk for Alzheimer's tomorrow night if you'd like to donate.\"Mom put the fries in T-Hoe's cup holder.

Then that slow white truck backed up, and sat facing us, halfon the concrete slab behind the garage, half on the driveway. Which completelyblocked my access to the garage.The guy saw us coming,and pulled up the driveway a little bit, barely off the concrete, so I stillcouldn\u2019t make my wide turn to get in. I stopped beside him.\u201cI\u2019m just here to readyour meter.\u201dWell, I\u2019ll be dingdang donged! That was the guy I saw walking across my front porch when I washome on a weekday.

No, not time to set the clocks back, or put out Halloween decorations, or slide my world-famous Chex Mix in and out of the oven (NOW WITH TWO ELEMENTS!). Nope. It's time for the ol' flu shot.This year I did not take advantage of the school flu shot clinic for faculty. It doesn't cost us anything because of our insurance. CeilingReds sends in a shooter, and we all cry a little bit then live happily ever after. Most of us. A couple hold onto their bitterness for a few days. We are not required to get the shot. We do it for our own good. The flu goes through a school faster than Lou Grant goes through Veal Prince Orloff, and faster than Hick goes through a vat of vegetable beef soup (not counting the liquid).No, I didn't want my insurance charged the day before I actually got the flu shot, like the procedure was last year. Just in case I decided not to go through with it, then had trouble getting one elsewhere because insurance said I already got one. I'm onto their tricks.I was not sure if I should get the flu shot like normal, because of this darn Xarelto blood-thinner coursing through my veins. So I made an appointment a few weeks back to see my doctor, and thought I might as well ask him about it, and get the shot there.That was the plan. In reality, I told the nurse why I was there, and mentioned the flu shot dilemma, and she said, \"Oh. I'll go get your shot and be right back.\"People never really listen to the nuances when Val speaks. Like the part about NOT WANTING THE SHOT UNTIL I ASKED THE DOCTOR IF IT WAS SAFE.So in she comes with that syringe, and I put my hand over my arm and said, \"Hang on there! I want to know if this is safe for someone on Xarelto.\" And the needle-wielder said, \"Oh, I'm sure it is. I just gave it to someone on Coumadin.\" Which is a blood-thinner that works in an entirely different way. I really put my foot down and my hand up, so she waylaid the doc in the hall of that inner sanctum, and he brushed by and said, \"Oh, sure it's okay.\" Which made me glad I had secretly stopped taking it two nights before, just in case.Stabber stuck me, explaining how she gives the shots to tall the staff, because they request it, really, what with her not throwing the needle like a dart, but shoving it in slowly and pushing the vaccine at a leisurely pace. Then she withdrew that needle, fiddled with a purple dinosaur bandaid that didn't want to open, then slapped in on my arm as an afterthought. I had the wherewithal to reach over and apply pressure to the stab wound for a good five minutes while she took my temperature and asked about my meds, continuing the cart-before-the-horse process.Good thing I did the ol' self-arm-press. My shot was around 11:15, and by 2:00 I had a sore arm with a knot the size of a plum just below the injection site. I kept an eye on it, lest it grow to the size of a Mackinaw peach, a fresh cantaloupe, and a ripe watermelon. It stayed about the same. After I slept on it all night, the knot disappeared, and the soreness went away after a day.And the moral is: Val is a big hypochondriatic baby when it comes to fluids injected into her muscles where thin blood that can't stop itself courses through veins and arteries."}, {"title": "If She Keeps This Up, She's Gonna Put My Proposed Handbasket Factory Out of Business Before It Even Opens", "date": "Wednesday, September 24, 2014", "text": "When I took my mom back home yesterday, she had three messages from my sister.

She needed to run an errand, and wanted Mom to sit in the car with the baby. Seems like nobody wants to let Mom out of the car lately. The reason for the errand perhaps reveals that people used to raise their kids right. Not many handbasket factories back in my day, not even proposed ones.Sis drives from her town to Backroads to buy her meat. It's not like she goes to Timbuktu. The distance is around 10 miles one way. Sis does not want to get her meat from Walmart, where they shoot it up with water to charge more. Nor does she like to shop at the only remaining grocery chain, where I have had to return expired merchandise on more than one occasion. Not even my mom would serve up some old cheese and past-date mayonnaise. But mainly that's because she doesn't eat cheese, and uses Miracle Whip.Anyhoo, Sis comes to Save A Lot for meat. Not the one where Mom gets her slaw. The one in my town. They have a deal where you can get a bargain on selected items in the meat department. They're 5 for $19.99. Now you have to know what you're doing, because if you only buy one or two of those items, you're not saving, because, for example, the family pack of hamburger is cheaper by the pound. But if you actually have five items you want, and can't use the big packs, it's a deal.Sis got home and looked at her receipt. The clerk had not charged her the $19.99! She felt bad. She didn't want to drag the baby back over there (that's a figure of speech, she didn't drag the baby the first time, either) just to go in and give the clerk the $19.99. So she called Mom, everybody's go-to gal for sitting in the car. Sudoku, baby...Mom can entertain herself.\"They're a small store, you know, and I hate for them to be $20.00 short. I want to take them the money.\"I guess Sis doesn't realize that Save A Lot is a national chain. Still, the people are very nice, and they have the best meat department around here. Sis has come a long way from when she sent Mom to buy her list of stuff from the Dollar Store, because she didn't want to be seen going in there. That's back when her husband was still mayor.

Make that visitorS, lest you jump to the conclusion that it was her neighbor from across the road. The one she would not take food to when a tree fell across his driveway and he couldn't get his car out a while back. Her excuse being, \"Val, he HAS a wife!\"Nope. The visitors pulled into her driveway (!!!) with a silver car. Mom only knew because she was sitting at her table downstairs, writing out bills, with the shades open on the front windows. \"Oh, dear!\" she thought. \"Who can this be, coming to my house? I really don't want to talk to anybody.\" Then she did what any bona fide Thevictorian would have done, and hid. She told me all about it one morning on our 6:00 a.m. phone call.\"I went to the window and looked out. There were two of them in the car. It was the Jehovah's Witness ladies. I crouched down and went over to the downstairs bathroom. I didn't turn the light on. I heard them ringing my doorbell. I thought, 'How many times are they going to ring that bell?' But they only rang it twice.\"\"Did you close the bathroom door?\"\"Yeeessss. Just in case.\"\"How did you know when they were gone?\"\"Well, every now and then I stuck my head out of the bathroom to see if I could see their car driving down the road. But I couldn't.\"\"What would you have done if they were looking in your windows when you peeped out?\"\"Oh, I don't know! That would have been terrible!\"\"So when did you come out?\"\"I crept along the wall, all bent over, until I got to the window. I raised my head just enough for my eyes to be over the windowsill, and I saw that they were backing out the driveway. I ducked down and went back to the bathroom for a few minutes.\"\"You used to let them in and talk to them. I remember from when I was in high school. [Where I was valedictorian, everybody remember?] I think they even told you that they really had to get going.\"\"Well, it's always the same ladies. They're very nice. I used to feel so bad. They would take off their shoes when they came in the door. And there I'd be with my muddy old tennis shoes...\"\"I don't really think that's a custom of the Jehovah's Witnesses. The kids in my class at school never did that.\"\"No. But they were being polite.\"\"Probably because you sat down with them in the living room, where no people had ever gone before, and they thought it was formal sitting room reserved for dignitaries. What did they tell you, anyway?\"\"Oh, they always had their little magazine with a story in it, and they would read the story, and then quote some Bible verses that went along with it. We would talk for a while. Then I would tell them I was sorry, but I wasn't interested just now, and give them a dollar or two. I remember one time, they sent a little girl, well, she must have been about twenty, and she thanked me and thanked me for those two dollars.\"\"Well, she must have pegged you for somebody who would some day donate five dollars to the Extraordinary Dance.\"\"I just didn't want to talk to them last week. I think I might start giving them handouts from my church. They say that's how to get rid of them. That if you do that, they won't come back.\"\"They're not like vampires with garlic. Don't you ever get the Mormon boys on bicycles? We always got them when we lived in town.\"\"No. What did you tell them?\"\"We didn't give them money. We just told them we weren't interested, and that they were good representatives, so polite, and dressed in shirts and ties. But we didn't hide from them. After a while we just said we had things to do.\"\"They never came out here.\"\"Maybe they knew it was Jehovah's Witness territory.\"\"Do you think so?\"\"No. But I know what you can do next time. Tell those ladies that you think your neighbor across the street would like to meet them. Since he's new around here.\"\"Oh! I think they were headed that direction when they backed out of my driveway!\"\"There you go! Without even trying, you have hooked up people who need each other.\"\"I don't know about that.

Sop up that saliva! I don't mean an actual TASTE, taste. Like swirling fine wine around in your mouth before spitting it into a bucket, or walking on Hick like a butterfly would in order to sneak a taste with its feet.Prepare yourself now...here it comes...That's Hick in his work clothes, back when he started building his creekside cabin. No. It may come as a surprise to you that Hick is NOT a plumber! He can do plumbing, but there's none of that going on in this cabin. It's rustic. Like the Jed Clampett and Granny's cabin before Milburn Drysdale got ahold of their bubblin' crude money.Here's a picture of the finished product, though it has been updated with a bedroom since the photo.Y'all are welcome to sit a spell on the front porch if you're in the neighborhood.

Nope. But he HAS been a subject for every medical procedure known to man. I suppose the highlights were that time he had a titanium plate screwed to his cervical vertebrae, just before which the surgeon informed him that he had a really fat neck. And the time he was flipped upside down on a tilt table and vibrated, in an effort to solve a problem with his inner ear. I swear. Those doctors would have had an easier time solving a problem with Maria, the flibbertigibbet, the will-o'-the-wisp, the clown.Every evening when I get home, I bump down the thermostat, put my feet up in Hick's La-Z-Boy, and listen to the phone messages. I'm not obsessed or anything. But if I don't, there's a light on that phone that, unlike little Cindy Lou Who's Christmas tree light, has no problem lighting on one side. It flashes until the message is listened to. That means the phone beside New Delly in my dark basement lair also flashes. It's enough to give me a seizure to rival that of Kramer every time he heard Mary Hart's voice on Entertainment Tonight.Thursday there was a call from Hick's regular doctor's office, reminding him of his appointment Friday afternoon. He goes every month for a B12 shot, due to his pernicious anemia. So the girl says the appointment time, and then says, \"You have a balance of twenty-two dollars and sixty-eight cents, so be sure you bring money with you.\" Like a person in this day and age runs around like a celebrity, no cash, no checks, no credit cards.Ain't THAT a fine how-do-you-do? I found it rather odd. Almost as off-putting as a Casey's clerk running out to accuse a matronly woman waiting for her son to pay for her gas of being a drive-off.When he got home, I reminded Hick of his appointment. \"Oh, and they said you owe twenty-something dollars, so bring money. It seems like I just sent them a check. I don't know how your have a balance due.\"\"Huh. That's stupid! You can bet I'm going to let them know about it!\" Hick was displeased a few years ago when the office staff done him wrong in some facet or another. He complained to the Doc himself, who said that was not going to happen anymore. I suppose Hick is lucky that nobody has shot an air bubble into an artery yet. Snitches get medical glitches is the word on the street.This morning I asked Hick if he paid his balance at the doctor. \"Yes. I told the gal about that message, too. I said, 'And boy was my wife PISSED!'\"\"What? You blamed that on ME? I wasn't even mad. I just told you that I thought I'd paid it. It was an odd amount, a few dollars and change for that part of your shot that's not covered, not twenty dollars. I just don't see how you can owe that much when you pay for an office visit every time.\"\"Last time, I didn't pay the twenty dollar copay because their card scanner didn't work. So it was their fault I had a balance. They couldn't take my payment.\" Never mind that Hick always has walking-around money that he skims from his weekly gas allowance, and uses for flea markets, Goodwill, and the auction. Guess his health wasn't a good enough reason to cough up a twenty and ask me for it thirty minutes later.Sooo...Big Bad Hick didn't want to show his butt (so to speak) while he was there getting a shot, so he blamed the outrage on ME.

Or at least to the edge of their property. They go the other direction, too, with a lone flag propped between two large rocks in the middle of their driveway.Something tells me they are not surrendering.I doubt this new barrier is designed to dissuade their two horses from wandering. They already have an electric fence, as you can see in the photo. Besides, the horses don't have access to the driveway. Here's what I think happened. I believe their two not-heaven hounds came home with a chicken carcass again.We had an issue soon after they moved in. Hick caught their mutts red-pawed. They ran over into the BARn field and snatched a chicken right out from under Hick's nose. Of course, even that little baby cartoon chicken hawk could snatch a chicken from under Foghorn Hickhorn's nose. Hick went a knockin' the next day, and the neighbor guy apologized, and politely refused Hick's offer to break his pets' chicken-killing habits by loaning out the shock collar we borrowed to break Ann of her bloodthirst. Soon thereafter, their dogs quit roaming onto our homestead.Now they have a new dog to go with one of the old dogs. It's a standard poodle with a whippet-like tail, off-white in color, and quite obnoxious. The old dog is a barrel-chested black fellow with tan on his chest and baboon-like black-and-tan butt with a bobbed tail. Every morning since mid-summer, these two dashed into our yard. Our dogs would start yapping at them around 5:00 a.m. from the porch. Then they'd move out to the front yard. Then up to the road. \"Bark, bark, bark!\" warned our dogs. And, like a first-year dainty schoolmarm trying to tame a 7th hour class of eighth graders...they were completely ignored.AND THEN THE NEIGHBOR DOGS WOULD CHARGE!That would explain why the chickens were scarce every morning when I watched out the window for them to peck in the front yard. Once school started, The Pony and I noticed that the neighbor dogs ran back to their own yard when we went up our driveway. They stood on their side of the road until we passed, then charged back into our yard.So...I think those doggies must have done something heinous and have been put under yard arrest.Just my theory.

But look at her this afternoon:She positively glistens! The only remnant that harkens back to her dirty days are the tangled pantaloons on her rear legs. I suppose the dognapper doesn't want to intrude upon Juno's private area. Yes, she's shiny as a new penny, if pennies were covered with black dog hair.The reason I was able to get this photo is because, you see, Juno was snarfing up her beloved cat kibble on the side porch. Please disregard Hick's hoard. I don't know why Gassy G needs two snack tubs of propane. Nor do I know why there's a saucer that used to sit under a plant pot sitting on the porch like Hick gave the cats a saucer of milk. They should be so lucky. They barely get to eat their own cat kibble. And, to my great surprise, there's ANOTHER black roasting pan suitable for serving up cat kibble right there by the propane tanks. The Igloo cooler contains a bag of dog biscuits from the auction. It will come as no surprise to you that Juno and Ann both turn up their noses at such treats. It's like I feel about Auction Meat, I imagine. And I don't even want to know why a strip of roofing shingles is on the porch.Here's my sweet, sweet Juno from another angle.

I know you're not going to believe this, but SLAW was involved!I only found out yesterday morning before school. It was duty day, too, so I had no time to tarry. I had to cut off the conversation while I was only five minutes behind schedule. But here's the gist of it.\"Oh, I went to town for some slaw. I was running out! I just went to the Save A Lot out here. I decided to get TWO containers, because it was on sale, and the date said it was good until October.\"\"Like expiration dates mean anything to you.\"\"Well, I'm sure it will be gone by then. So while I was getting the slaw, I saw that their potato salad was also $.99, so I picked up a container of that. I never look at the receipt. But this time, when I got out to the car, I did. The potato salad was $.99, but she had charged me $3.98 for the two slaws! I was not going to let them get away with that. So I took my bag and my receipt and went back inside. I told her, 'I'm usually wrong on things like this, but it seems to me that you did not ring up my slaw for $.99 like your sign says. The potato salad was $.99, but I'm pretty sure your ad said that slaw was also $.99. And this receipt looks like you charged me $3.98 for two slaws.' She said she would check on it, and took my receipt and my bag into the managers office.\"\"Oh, no! You shouldn't have let her take your bag in there! I hope they didn't pee in you slaw or anything.\"\"Well, she just took it from me. It has a plastic seal around the lid. So I'll know if it's been opened.\"If it has, you take it right back out there and tell them it might have been tampered with, and get one off the shelf yourself. And watch the price when they ring it up!\" Okay. They were in there quite a while. Then she came out and said she was sorry, but their register was not ringing up the slaw for $.99. So she gave me a refund. I was really proud of myself to get my two dollars back. And I got to thinking, that sale has been going on for two days already...Now let me interrupt our conversation momentarily to inform you that my mom does not have a prejudiced bone in her body. She believes everyone should be treated equally, and sometimes even bends over backwards to emphasize how a certain person from assorted minority groups behaved in an exemplary fashion, or went out of their way to accommodate her. She is an equal opportunity, sometimes inadvertently patronizing, staunch supporter of all ethnicities and ablednesses, and even found something nice to say about one of the KKK who were handing out fliers on a street corner last year: \"I think it's a shame that they're allowed to do that. I thought about going around the block so I didn't have to pass them. But there was one guy who had on the nicest blue robe. He must have been the leader, because his robe was different. It was really pretty.\" So, with this in mind, I reveal the next thing out of Mom's mouth concerning her slaw:...I bet they gypped so many people.\"\"Um. Mom. You can't really say that these days. It's an insult to gypsies. You can't say gypped.\"\"Oh. I didn't know that. I will try to be more careful.

You know those sproingy spring things you screw into the baseboard area to stop the door from banging the doorknob through the wall? Door stops, I think they're called. Not the wedge kind that are at a premium in public schools, stolen every day in walk-by hall-liftings if you don't engrave your name into the side. No, I'm talking about the home kind. The gold or silver white-rubber-ended sproingy spring things. Yeah. You know what's funny about them?THEY ARE REALLY NOT ALL THAT FLEXIBLE!It's true. They are not nearly as flexible as an adult baby toe. They're not! Just last evening, I made that discovery. Who knew? Not my baby toe, that's for sure.I might not have found out, except the temperature was scheduled to drop into autumn digits last night. So I rigged our cheap thermostat for HEAT, and set the temp at 69 degrees. Funny thing, the blower kept blowing, even though the house temperature was 72. I knew it couldn't be the air condition, because COOL was set for 78 while we were at work. It defied the laws of physics, that heat pump!So...as I came out of the closet (perhaps I could find a way to phrase that differently in case a journalism student from NYU is lurking in the next booth eavesdropping on my blog post) with my comfy clothes, I stuck my foot over the bathroom floor vent to see if it was blowing hot air or cold air or stale air.I never really found out what air was blowing, because my baby toe lost a game of chicken with the gold white-rubber-ended sproingy spring thing. That baby toe was as flexible as a Romanian gymnast. Like it didn't have a bone inside the skin. Or like the bone inside the skin found a new angle to hang at. Like the pinky finger on Denzel Washington's right hand. You can have your fact-checker Google that if you doubt me.You know that long moment when you commit some calamity with a toe or foot, when you know you're hurt, but there's that time lapse while the dendrites release their neurotransmitters to the axon and...well...no time for a biology lesson now. Let's just suffice to say that you know the pain is coming, but it takes a while to feel it? Uh huh. That's what happened. I went ahead and hollered, because I knew I would want to. What I didn't want to do was look at my baby toe. Even though it was in a sock, I did not want to see if it stuck out like a hitchhiker's thumb.I still haven't looked. No use crying over pooled blood and possible dislocation. Whining, yes. Crying, no. I figure if it fits in the shoe, it must be salvageable.I really didn't seem to have so many physical faux pas until I started taking this blood thinner.

He might think he's going under for the third time in some icy-cold clear green water in a deep hole where granite has been chipped away in blocks for a variety of uses, including, but not limited to: building facades, gravestones, countertops, flooring, and backsplashes.No, Hick is having trouble making a decision. Not that such a state is uncommon for him. I almost feel sorry for my sweet baboo.At first he was all excited, calling people and talking loudly, because we all know that cell phones are just one thin stairstep above tin cans and twine, telling his cronies that he had just been given a house. A HOUSE! Okay. Hick gets excited a bit more than other folks at the though of getting something for nothing. He doesn't realize at first that \"nothing\" may turn out to be a couple of hundred dollars in miscellaneous costs.The more he thought about traveling the 55 miles to claim his treasure, measure it, check with a buddy to help him, get the house onto his trailer, drive it home on winding two-lane blacktop, find a place for it, unload it, and come up with gas money for all the trips back and forth to set up this grand plan...the more Hick thought he might not want the free house.So sad to see his dream go down the drain.Here's what Hick coulda had:Yeah. It's two feet too wide for his trailer. He's not sure if it will be too tall to fit under the overpasses once he reaches the highway. His helper often excuses himself because something suddenly comes up. And I told Hick he is not taking more money from The Pony's stash like he did at the beginning of summer, and still hasn't paid back. A house is not like a trailer from work that can be used to bring in more free stuff. I will not be subsidizing this bargain.I told The Pony, \"Your dad could save all the money he would spend on gas to arrange to bring this cabin home, and use it to buy supplies to build another cabin.\"\"Huh. He already has all the stuff he needs to build another cabin.\"Uh huh. I sense the clamor, clamor of little hammers this autumn.

That's a feat in itself lately, because it means I can actually turn my head enough to see parts of the hall that are not directly across from my doorway.Staffer was heading for the closet right next to my classroom. The one with the microfiche machine and three million reams of paper and some file cabinets filled with old records. It's always locked, but I know what's in there because, well, my room is right next door, and I have connections with master key keymasters. In fact, this is the room I used to plan on using for my own personal tornado haven, before our disaster procedures were revamped, sending us all way down deep into the bowels of the earth to the boys' athletic locker room that smells like bowels.So, as Staffer stuck her key in the lock, I stopped her. \"Oh. I think there's something I should tell you before you go in there. Last Tuesday, I saw a copperhead/lizard/newt/salamander laying in my classroom doorway when I returned from Labor Day weekend. I told The Pony to grab it with a tissue and throw it away, but he said it sure did move funny. And when I turned to see what he was talking about, I saw the tail rounding the corner of my entryway. I looked down the hall, but I didn't see it anywhere. I think it went under the door and into this closet.\"Staffer listened to me, wide-eyed, like there was going to be a punchline. Like maybe I was telling her about the escaped mental patient with hooks for hands who frequented lovers' lane, waiting to kill happy young couples, and I was going to say, '...and do you know what they saw hanging from the door handle? A HOOK!' while I grabbed her shoulders to startle her. Then she saw that I was serious.\"Oh. Now I'm scared. I wish you hadn't told me that.\"\"Well, wouldn't you rather know than be surprised? I was just trying to help.\"\"Um...I don't know. Now I'm nervous.\"\"But you'll be prepared if it jumps out at you from those stacks of paper cartons.\"\"I...I guess so.

As The Pony filled my bubba cup full ofice from Frig\u2019s door spout, something went horribly awry. The cup slippedsideways, refunding its contents onto the red-and-white vinyl flooring. ThePony set to retrieving the icy quarter-moons and tossed them into the sink.I stepped into thework zone to grab a bowl for The Pony\u2019s leftover roast vegetables, and trodupon a frozen fragment. My left Croc absorbed most of the shock, but it startedto slide. I quickly stomped my right red-Croc-shod foot down so as not to flipbackward and give myself an incurable subdural hematoma. Sons of people wholive on blood-thinners shouldn\u2019t throw ice. Maybe I\u2019ll make that into a t-shirtto sell in hospital pharmacies and gift shops.The jamming of theknee that I injured getting out of the shower caused it to bend slightlybackwards, and flood with blood inside the joint capsule when I took mymedicine a half hour later. Funny how a blood THINNER can make my knee FATTER!So\u2026after a painfulevening and night, I arose slowly and hobbled through my morning routine. It\u2019shard to bend my sore neck to scope out the forest-green floor tile of themaster bathroom. But I was fairly confident that the pea gravel and cedar chipsfrom Hick\u2019s work boots had been swept away.OUCH!A not-so-funny thinghappened on the way to the shower. In the dogleg left from the sink past thecorner triangle tub, in the area just in front of the wastebasket that residesbetween toilet and tub, a razor-sharp sliver of the unknown imbedded itselfinto my right heel.YOW!Like a mutt\u2019s buttunacquainted with toilet paper, my heel dragged itself across one of thebathroom throw rugs in an effort to scrape off the offending freeloader. Afterthree tries, it dropped off. A large crescent of toenail, the likes not seen inthe Thevictorian household since The Unfortunate Braided Rug Toenail Incidentof 1994, mocked me from the edge of the rug. I could not bend over to pick itup, what with my swollen knee and recently broken neck.I woke up Hick to getready for work, and asked him to pick up his toenail to prevent futureincidents which could render his beloved wife\u2019s heel as leaky as the trunk of aVermont maple in March. And do you know what my sweet baboo did?He said, \u201cIt\u2019s not mytoenail.\u201dUh huh.

Or a place to harbor this fugitive until the heat throws in the rice towel? Just in case. I don't need it right this moment. But I almost did a couple hours ago! Here's how it went down. We talk like that, you know. Us almost-arrested innocent bystanders who don't give a hoot about grammar.I had a faculty meeting after school. Then I waited for The Pony to finish a session of his independent study Personal Finance class on the counselor's computer. We took off like bats out of not-heaven for the bank, to deposit some money into Genius's account. He bought a futon to fit under his dorm bed that he jacked up so he can lounge about watching the TV he bought himself. Which he did NOT ask us to pay for. But since he was looking for a futon at the Goodwill store and insurance salvage stores, and asked Hick to keep his eye peeled for one at the auction, Hick and I decided we would pay for a new one from Walmart. Because who wants their Genius bringing home bedbugs over the Christmas holiday? Not this tender-skinned family, that's for sure.After leaving the bank, we stopped to gas up T-Hoe. It's not my regular gas station, but I go there a couple times a month when it's convenient, either for gas or for lottery tickets. Let the record show that Val never runs T-Hoe's tank down to EMPTY. Nope. Not gonna do it. I'm not forking over that much cash on gas. I fill it at half a tank. Which is bad enough. But at least I'm not like my mom, who refuses to put in more than $20 at a time. If I did that, I would be getting gas every two days.So...as is our habit, I climbed down to put in the gas, then gave The Pony the cash to go in and pay. I'm not using a card at the pump. People can steal your identity like that, you know! So The Pony trots across the lot, not very far, it's just a Casey's with four pumps, to look for a donut snack and pay for my gas. He does this every week at my regular gas Casey's, with nary a problem.After putting the pump handle back, I opened my driver's door to grab some change. The gas was $45.30. I handed The Pony three twenties and a quarter and a nickel. \"Here. Get something if you want, but if you don't see anything, pay with this change, so I can get a ten and a five back.\" The Pony jumped out of his back seat behind the driver's seat, and I climbed in. Let the record show that our seats were on the building side of the car. The road was to my right. I was the only car at the pumps, and there was one more car parked by the building, with an old man who had gone inside. That left just The Pony and a geezer inside as customers.My window was down. I turned to get some Green Apple Germ-X out of my purse. I slathered up my hands and rubbed them together. Waved them around to dry, inhaling the scent. Then I put the Germ-X back in my purse. I put on my seatbelt. I laid my left elbow on the window ledge, waiting for The Pony. T-Hoe was not running. You turn your car off while pumping gas, you know. And who turns it on to burn up the gas you just pumped in while you wait for your son to pay? Not this ol' Val. I turned to look inside to see if The Pony was coming out yet.\"Did you send someone in to pay for your gas?\" A youngish chubby dude in a brand-spankin'-new Casey's shirt was halfway across the lot, coming toward me. I'd say he was maybe 15 feet away.\"Yes. I'm not a drive-off. My son is inside paying.\"\"Oh.\" Dude stopped and stared at me. Then turned around.I swear. There must be a traveling ring of late-middle-aged, L'Oreal-medium-brown-coiffed, pleasantly plump schoolmarms marauding about the countryside stealing gas. Because never have I ever, in all my years of driving, been suspected of being a drive-away. It's not like this was a 24-bay gas station truck stop mere feet from the interstate. I guess Dude was planning to grab onto my trailer hitch and let me drag him along while he called the police on his cell phone. And me with my bad neck and creaky knees, itchin' to ditch my T-Hoe and run from the police.The Pony came out with a donut and a handful of change. He was chuckling.\"I was just accused of being a drive-off!\"\"I know. I saw him come out. He said something about he was going out to see if you were paying for your gas.\"\"And you didn't tell him?\"\"No. He didn't ask me. He wanted to go out. The other guy didn't say anything. He was waiting on that man. But this guy acted like he wanted to go out.\"\"Thanks. I can't believe that after all that time I sat here, the car not even running, waiting for you...he thought I was going to drive off.

Warning: Do Not Try To Picture This Incident. Val's best ol' ex-teaching buddy Mabel, unaware of the shower switch, texted Val about her level of incapacitation, revealing that she had said some prayers for Val and her neck. Upon learning of the improved neck health and the shower injury, Mabel offered pertinent advice: \"Stop showering.\" I am concerned that Mabel may never have been required to read \"The Monkey's Paw,\" and might need to be a bit more specific when she sends out prayers for my ailing body parts.My mom was all in a tizzy this week because she worries about her Five-Dollar Daughter. She offered many suggestions, involving medicines or muscle-warming aids that contain substances that will interact with Val's blood-thinner. After being reminded that the goal here was for me to stop my neck from hurting without exsanguinating, Mom buckled down to work on the case.\"I sat by your sister in church yesterday. Her neck is sore, too. She was really having a time. There's this man that sits by us that we don't really like. Your sister couldn't turn and shake hands with him when we're supposed to greet each other. She's afraid he'll think she did it on purpose because we don't really like him. But she couldn't turn, because of her neck.\"\"Ask her if it still hurts. Maybe there's something going around like a couple of years ago, and the old school nurse who goes to your church told you that it was a virus that settles in the neck.\"\"Oh, I remember that! It took me about six months to get over it. You probably didn't want to hear that.\"\"No. But see if Sis's neck got any better. Maybe there's hope for me. My best ol' ex-teaching buddy Mabel says Walmart has a heating pack you can put on your neck and it works for 12 hours. She's used them on her back before. You peel off some foil, and it starts heating. If you go to Walmart, see if you can find one. She says there's no medicine. It's like a cold pack, only heat.\"\"You know, I think I have something here for a sore neck. I've had it a long time. You can used it like a cold pack or a heating pack. I'll have to look for it.\"Later that evening, Mom called to say that Sis said she got rid of her sore neck by spraying on some kind of heat from a can that she got in Walmart. \"She says it works all day.\"\"That doesn't sound like something I could use. I'm sure there's aspirin or some form of painkiller in there, just like in BenGay or Thermagesic. I don't think I should try it.\"Mom sprang into action to heal her Five-Dollar Daughter. She goes to Walmart almost every day, anyway. So the next morning she gave me the scoop. \"I looked in Walmart for one of those heating things to put on your neck. I didn't see any, but I know I have one here. I'm going to look for it, and I will give it to you to help your neck. I don't use it anyway.\"According to Mom, this was some kind of heat pack that does not give off any chemical medicine. You could wrap it around you neck to relieve the soreness. So I told her okay. Anything to make Mom feel like she was helping. Couldn't hurt.The next morning, Mom had found her heat pack. \"I'm going to run it over after school. You can take it home with you. You just put it in the microwave for two minutes, then it holds the heat and you can keep it on your neck. I don't know if you could use it at school. It doesn't smell. It's not all that big. I know you have a microwave in your room.\"\"Okay, thanks. Bring it by this afternoon and I'll look at it.\"\"It has the instructions with it. I don't know how long ago I got it. But the instructions are on a card in the package. You'll remember to take the card out before you put it in the microwave, won't you?\"\"Yes, Mom. I think I can remember that.\"So...I was thinking Mom had some spectacular gadget from Walmart that would warm up my neck and relieve the soreness. Not a new one, but one that somebody had given her down the line. Maybe it would be our Label Baby Junior, and Mom could re-gift it to me. She showed up at school as promised. And this is what she brought me:Not exactly what I was expecting. It was rice in a kitchen towel, enclosed in a freezer bag. Doesn't look store-boughten to me!I have not yet given it a try.

After weeks of temps in the upper nineties, the mercury only rose into the mid-seventies today.I had rushed to Save A Lot for supplies before it was time for The Pony to leave for his first bowling league performance of the season. I was cutting up carrots and onions when Hick came in through the kitchen door, fresh from mowing my mom's yard.\"Oh! Carrots and onions!\"I'm sure he was fishing for more information. I withheld it. Let them eat carrots and onions, I say! Even Hick must have known there would be meat involved in such an elaborate meal. Baby carrots don't just bust out of the package and jump into the big black-and-white spotted roasting pan (identical to the one on the porch shelf that holds my sweet, sweet Juno's beloved cat kibble), you know. Nor do onions shed their skins and quarter themselves. The potatoes had not yet been summoned to the counter.The small roasting pan was also called into service. We love some roasted veggies around this ol' homestead. I doused my rooty friends with a bit of vegetable oil, some steak sauce, a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and a dusting of Hidden Valley Ranch Dip Mix powder, then ground some fresh black pepper over the top. Into the two-element oven they went, to soften up before the roast was added.When Hick and The Pony came home around 3:00, I had just taken the hearty meal out of the oven and placed the two roasting pans on the stove top to rest. I'll be darned if a roast is going to rest while Val works...so I went to have a short nap. I knew Hick was home because I was startled awake by his question:\"Taking a nap?\"Seriously. Who asks that? Because there is no way to answer. 'Yes' is a lie, because you're obviously not sleeping. 'No' implies that the asker is crazy. 'Of course I'm not taking a nap. Whatever made you think THAT? As if people laying in bed in the middle of the day are trying to catch up on some sleep!'Seeing that my extra winks were cut short in their prime, I had a question of my own for Hick.\"Did you lift the lid?\"\"No!\"\"I'm sure you did.\"\"No I didn't!\"\"Come on. Tell me the truth. You lifted the lid on the roast, didn't you?\"\"No. I just looked at it.\"\"Oh. So now you can see through metal? You looked at it, but didn't lift the lid? How can you do that?\"\"I just looked at it.\"\"So you DID lift the lid!\"\"Well, okay. But I just looked at it to see what it was.\"\"Why didn't you just admit that you lifted the lid, instead of saying 'No'?\"\"Because I thought you were going to ask me if I ate some, and so I had already planned to say 'No' when you asked.\"\"Did you eat some?\"\"No.\"\"Like I'm going to believe you now.\"One of these days, Hick is going to learn who he's dealing with.

Never mind that she sometimes mutilates their names, referring in particular to a left fielder named \"Holloway,\" and a favorite pitcher who was traded as \"Joe Perry.\" I don't even think Mom is an Aerosmith aficionado.Okay, I confess that I don't so much WATCH the games as I DVR them and fast-forward through them until there's some action. Seriously. It's almost as bad as golf. (Sorry, Joe H.) Did you know I can watch a complete game in about 20 minutes? No need to sit through the pitcher stepping off to psych out the batter, and the batter retaliating by backing up and fiddling with the velcro on his batting gloves every pitch. No need to watch that lead-off batter go to a full count every at-bat and then foul a couple off for good measure.On our 6:00 a.m. phone calls, Mom and I have to rehash last night's game. Sometimes we are rushed, so when she says, \"What did you think of the game last night?\" I just let her have it all at once.\"I am so sick of your guy stealing the most-hit batter title from MY guy! I have never liked him. In fact, if I was the pitcher, I would hit him every time. And as he was walking to first base grimacing at me, I'd hit him again! Yep! I'd fire that ball over there and bean him good. I could, you know. Because as major league pitcher, I would have control. I don't get how this guy acts like he's so put-upon when he can't move his butt out of the way of a pitch. Besides, he has an elbow protector. If that doesn't protect him, then major league baseball teams better start asking for their money back. Oh! And don't get me started! Last night he hit himself in the foot with a foul tip, and laid down like a little girl. THEN he had the audacity to hit our base runner in the toe! And to think I used to get mad because he hit into too many double plays...\"\"But...he's been the reason they won the last couple of games, you know.\"\"Yes I know! I still don't like him. I appreciate the wins. But I will never like him. MY guy gets hit by the pitcher, and he skips down to first, all smiles, because, hey, he's on base, it's part of the game. MY guy makes fantastic plays in the outfield, slamming into the wall, leaping above the fence, scooping up shoestring catches, running all the way over to your guy's territory to make his plays for him, is hitting over .300, and everybody's like 'Meh.' But your guy walks out with his grimace, and everybody fawns all over him, what a solid guy he is. I just don't see it.\"\"What about that new guy last night?\"\"That's another thing! My power went off, and the DVR stopped, and when the picture came back, the camera was on this guy in the dugout. I thought, 'Hey, that ol' clumsy-mule-looking guy sure looks different.' Then I found out it's a completely NEW guy up from the minors. And the announcers had the nerve to say, 'Yes, he's really gotten in shape this year, and is so much more mobile, so the Cardinals decided to give him a chance.' Which made me think, 'Since when have the Cardinals cared if their 1st baseman was mobile and in shape?'\"\"I think maybe I fell asleep, but I did wake up to see that they'd won.\"\"Do you know how many pitchers we used? SEVEN! And my favorite little guy only got to pitch 1/3 of an inning! They brought him in with the bases loaded and two outs, and he did the job to get them out of that jam, then he didn't even get to pitch the next inning. I swear I could be a major league manager.

Everybody knows his last name.Last week, we had a new girl take the order. She was not very good. But she was cheerful and polite. \"Oh, let me ask.\" And she did. Our routine was not disrupted. When The Pony went in to pay, he said the regular guy, behind her back, was holding his hand in a claw like he was going to twist her head off. Still, the pizza was good enough. Even though the leftovers I took the next day had beef that tried to stampede its way out of my descending colon.Yesterday, we had what Genius's old prospective iPhone seller from China on eBay would NOT have called a Professional Sunshine Experience. The minute I crossed over the highway into residential space, I had The Pony dial the number and hand me the phone. Normally, by the time I get to the stop sign by the park that holds the Labor Day Picnic, the order is complete, and we have fifteen minutes until it's ready. That leaves time to stop for gas, or tire air, or for The Pony to buy a bottle of Sprite. He likes to eat his pizza piping hot on the way home. He saves the breadsticks and some pizza for the next evening. It's a finely-choreographed ballet. Let no Domino's worker tear it asunder.

If The Pony hadn't been counting on pizza for supper, I would have said, \"Forget it!\"We wasted some time at Casey's convenience store after The Pony got his Sprite. Contemplated filling T-Hoe's leaky left front tire. Blocked the air hose, but decided against it. Counted out correct change. Waited to dart across traffic to the lake road, the one which would take the most time. When we arrived at Domino's, the parking lot was full of cars. There are usually two delivery cars, and one other car with people picking up pizza. I'd say there were twelve cars on the lot yesterday.The pizza tasted fine.

He often comes back for more, so I am doing him a favor,actually, by letting that food sit out until he\u2019s done.Lastnight, I reached into Frig to grab some of those leftovers to warm in the ovenfor supper. OOF! That\u2019s the sound of me heaving a hefty packet of pork steaksfrom the top shelf. They shouldn\u2019t have been so heavy. Only three pork steaks.Not exactly half a hog. I threw my neck out and probably gave myself aherniated disk. When I went to unwrap the spoils, I found out why that packetlifted like a lead balloon.Thethree pork steaks were wrapped in four feet of foil. I am not exaggerating! Imeasured. Hick took a two-foot section, put the pork steaks in a stack in themiddle, and wound that foil around them. Then he ripped off another two feet ofaluminum, put it across the top of that already-wrapped packet, and folded thataround the silver lump.Where,exactly, does he think these pork steaks are going?It\u2019snot like they will be travelling across the Namib, subject to scraping by swirlingsands. They are not going to be dropped into a Port-A-Potty and sloshed aroundon the back of a honeywagon.

That\u2019s theunemployment office to you laypeople. I had a supervisor who abhorred the useof paperclips in the files. Not my first supervisor, Bob, with his almosttransparent skin that he apparently washed with lye soap twelve times a day,thus necessitation heavy lotioning from 8:00 to 4:30. No, it was my secondsupervisor, Larry, who looked exactly like a real-life version of Ned Flanders,right down to the mustache.\u201cWhydo you need paperclips in your files? I want you to pull every one of them.Those papers are not going anywhere. You put them in order, close the folder,and file it. Nothing is getting loose. They\u2019re in the drawer. Not. Going.Anywhere.\u201d Sheesh! You\u2019d think he bought those paperclips himself. Maybe he wastaking them home, building the world\u2019s biggest ball of paperclips. Maybe not.Normally,I prefer Hick to put the leftovers in flat white rectangular plastic containerswe have gotten from Chinese carryout. Not perfectly flat, mind you, but abouttwo inches deep, with a clear lid that adds another inch. Enough of thistomfoolery with the foil.IT\u2019S ANONRENEWABLE RESOURCE!Hickis singlehandedly depleting our bauxite reserves. I\u2019m so glad I only bought theSave A Lot regular Poly Steel brand, and not the Reynolds Wrap Heavy Duty.I thinkHick should be sentenced to the Sisyphean task of collecting every stray beer canfrom along the highways, county roads, rural byways, and pig trails ofBackroads.Thatseems fitting."}, {"title": "From the Fine How-Do-You-Do Department", "date": "Tuesday, September 2, 2014", "text": "This is what I foundupon arrival at my classroom door this fine Tuesday morning after a three-day holidayweekend:Yeah.

I contributed a baked potato for The Pony, who simply loves that single vegetable, and some delectable baked beans and fresh strawberries. Not that they were mixed, of course. I would have tossed in a salad, but The Pony is a grazer who is pushing it to eat three items, and Hick loves him some meat. No fillers for him.My baked beans were actually made in a saucepan on top of the stove. I know you believe Hick, that I only \"cook\" by warming things in the oven or heating them in the microwave. But I'm branching out. I used to bake the beans in the oven. I like them when they get a little crusty on top. However, my oldest stepson once asked, \"What's the matter with these beans?\" So I stopped that for a while in shame. Even though that was my desired result. The kid also asked his dad once, when I was working late at open house, \"Where's the cheese?\" Because Hick made him a grilled cheese sandwich with a single slice of Kraft American Singles, while I had always made it with slabs of Velveeta. We won't even go into the \"stringy meat\" meal. Let's just say that kid was thin as a rail, so perhaps he was a bit of a finicky eater. And his dad accused him of holding his utensils like a future prison inmate, with the handles in his fists, but he really did turn out fairly normal.Anyhoo...getting back to my beans, I didn't really start from scratch. I sliced some maple-cured bacon, diced an onion, browned them in the saucepan, then added a big can of KC Masterpiece Pulled Pork Baked Beans. Oh! But I didn't stop there. I added some yellow mustard, some Save A Lot hickory barbecue sauce, and some Worcestershire sauce. Then I simmered them about an hour and let them set until time to warm them for supper.Mmmm. The best baked beans ever. A can of KC Masterpiece on the stovetop.At least I didn't hand Hick a spoon and the can."}, {"title": "This Villager Failed At Raising the Child", "date": "Sunday, August 31, 2014", "text": "Once upon a time, in Genius's youth, he was seeking a cell phone over the internet. I'm a little fuzzy on the details, since we did not buy him his first cell phone until his birthday the year he was in 6th grade. So it must have been in the year or two leading up to this great present that Genius took it upon himself to find bargains that he thought might tempt me into getting him a phone before my master plan schedule.\"Look, Mom! This is such a bargain! And you can use PayPal, too!\"Um. No. You are not getting a cell phone yet. Besides, that one is in China. No way am I buying a cell phone off the internet, and especially not from China.\"\"Oh. I didn't notice that.\"\"Look at the shipping details. Besides, my first clue was where it said, 'Having a Hot expensive phone experience with spending ten times less.' And that part about 'Check out more on this Brand new lovely Garget.' Not to mention the seller's Mission: 'Provide the professional sunshine feeling to our customers and turn out to have mutually positive feedback.'\"Yeah. Genius was pretty mad at me for a while over that refusal. Which is neither here nor there today. I simply dug that example out of the vault to explain that today's post is not going to give you a PROFESSIONAL SUNSHINE EXPERIENCE. Sorry.No rainbow, unicorn, fluffy kitten, or teacup piglet stories to follow. It's downright depressing. The seamy underside of Backroads. Seamier than the headless body found in a septic tank just up the road? No. But seamy, nonetheless.The Pony and I drove out to my mom's house after she got home from church. The Pony forgot to fix Mom's cell phone while he was there. She somehow got it on vibrate again, and doesn't know how to get it off. The Pony and Genius have both fixed it before. This time, Mom planned to write down the steps on an index card so my sister the ex-mayor's wife can fix it in church if it happens again. Only The Pony could not fix it. AND, when Mom tried to call it from her house phone, it gave a busy signal. Who knows. Maybe a person should upgrade their phone once every ten years or so. This little brick is so old that it's not even a flip phone. But that is neither here nor there. I'm putting off the horror that is about to unfold.We drove into a maelstrom on the way to Mom's. Rain sluiced down on T-Hoe's windshield like water from...well...a sluice! Winds blew twigs and leaves from the trees. Visibility was nigh nil. But it all petered out (heh, heh, you know what I just said) by the time we left Mom's. And now I am out of delay tactics.As I pulled out onto the main road from a side street by Mom's church, I saw a boy in the side yard of house that faced the main thoroughfare. He could have been the twin of that Dasher boy in need of a leash who I saw yesterday in Save A Lot. I almost hope he WAS the same kid. I do not like to think that there are more than one of his type in town.DasherII was not wearing track pants today, but ragtag athletic shorts and a nondescript t-shirt. The kind of clothes Backroads youth sport all summer until they get three new ensembles to start the school year. DasherII stood on the concrete sidewalk in his yard, a half-grown, mostly-white-with-black calico cat crouched between his bare feet. As I turned onto the road, DasherII bent at the waste. He was shaking his finger at the kitty. Then he swatted Kitty on the head!I found that upsetting. It's not like Kitty had wrenched free from DasherII's arms, perhaps scratching him in the escape attempt, eliciting instant anger from the child. Nope. Kitty was crouched like a little sphinx, chest over toes, minding her own business. I SO wanted to make a right at the next block, and another right, and another...until I came up that side street so I could give DasherII my teacher stinkeye. Perhaps say, \"That's no way to treat an animal. Let it go.\"I did not do that. You know why? Because I'm a confrontation-avoider, first of all. I'm not one to kidnap a dog in the middle of the night. But also because the cons outweigh the pros.PRO:DasherII will see the error of his ways, and never abuse an animal again.DasherII will run into his house, leaving Kitty to flee.DasherII will learn a lesson 'bout a-messin' with a kitty in public view.CON:DasherII will squeeze Kitty between his feet just to show me who's boss.DasherII will scream and his momma will come out and threaten to beat my a$$.DasherII will scream and his daddy will come out and blast me with a shotgun.DasherII will scream and a neighbor will call the cops to come get Val-the-Molester.DasherII will scream and Kitty will escape, running right under the tires of T-Hoe.Maybe I could have honked to distract him.

Belt 'em!\" back when jumping on bandwagons wasn't cool. But the practice of Soap-On-a-Rope-ing youngsters never really got Val riled up for or against. Until now.This afternoon in Save A Lot, as I pushed my cart on its predesignated course, a little boy kept trying to throw himself under the wheels. Okay. Not that he was so coordinated. I would have needed to give him a little help, and I'm pretty sure that's frowned upon, even here in Missouri. But the next person he darts in front of may not be as tenderhearted and sugary sweet as Rainbows-and-Kittens Val.There I was, ready to round the end cap at the jelly/peanut butter/condiment/pickle/olive aisle, when that wiry dynamo dressed in an orange t-shirt and navy blue track pants with a white stripe darted past, scooting his feet. He was like a weird, forward, speeded-up moonwalker. My cart caught his eye. Figuratively, not literally, but only because I have quick reflexes. Dasher momentarily stopped in his gliding tracks, like a deer in the headlights, and made eyes like Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone, but without slapping his dad's aftershave on his cheeks. That could be because I gave him the Teacher Eye. The look that let him know he was not nearly as cute and precious as he thought he was. He scampered on, house left.It's not like the kid didn't know better. He was six or seven years old. Not at a stage where it would be easy to take candy from him. Or where he was just fractious because he was missing his nap. I don't profess to be a model parent. But my own kids never acted like this in a store. Sure, Genius was mighty cute hiding inside the round clothes rack at Walmart. But he wasn't running willy-nilly. He walked purposefully at that age when seeking out an associate to inquire about new hard drives or modems. Don't think I never had to leave my cart in the store and forget about shopping to haul a melting-down child to the car. I did. One time. That's all it took. And it was not The Pony. Kids will get away with what you let them.I'll be darned if Dasher didn't reappear one aisle later, at the back of the store, approaching from the opposite side, and did the same thing. How he got all the way around the store and changed direction to double back is beyooooond me. It's not like he was fetching a forgotten item from his mom's list. I assume he had a mom. Because at the end of the pasta aisle, I saw him standing on the foot of a cart as a woman pushed him past the hot dog and cold cut cooler.After I loaded my box of groceries in the back of T-Hoe, I looked in BOTH of my working mirrors to make sure I would not run over anything sneaky like that concrete-surrounded light pole at Office Max. Dasher dashed by my door and ran to the back of a small silver SUV parked directly across from me. Startlingly enough, it was NOT the same one that almost T-boned me on the road yesterday.This silver SUV was full of folks. It was like a hillbilly clown car. I can say that, you know, being a hillbilly myself. It looked to me like the twenty-or-so people in the back seat threw up their hands as if to say, \"NO MORE!\" when Dasher tried to climb in. I waited and waited for his mom to walk by, but she did not. That's how far removed she was from controlling him. He could have been flattened crossing the parking lot.I'm not saying people should put a metal choke collar on their offspring's neck, and give a yank every now and then. No. That would be inhumane.

Can't go risking a slaw shortage over the holiday.Murphy was my copilot today. Murphy. Of the law fame. I stopped off at the credit union to put in the monthly allotment for The Pony's college fund. A friend and classmate of Genius was working. He grabbed my receipt as it printed out on a printer so old it had those little hole things along the edge for a tractor thingy to feed it through. Being a bit like Genius, and of the same no-patience, instant gratification, cutting-edge-technology world...Clerky grabbed the top of that receipt to hurry it along. Except that receipt was for the customer at the other window, and mine was still attached and printing. I had a smear on the bottom line that I could not read, and a shark-teeth-smile chunk out of the bottom edge.\"WHAT? You ruined my receipt!\"\"Oh, c'mon. You know you're just going to throw it away.\"\"Um. You were in my class for a whole year. You know how I operate. That's a big deal to me.\"\"Yeah. I should have known you're going to save it. Sorry.\"I was pulling his leg a bit. But not by much. I guess I'll get over it. I picked up Mom at the park and headed for the bank. Just the ATM. I did my Genius-depositing yesterday, because I knew there would be long lines today. As there were. The Pony and I had a bit of an adventure on the way to get Mom. The car in front of us slammed on the brakes to make a left turn across two lanes of traffic. As The Pony said, \"The driver in the car he cut in front of...was like you. Yelling. And he gave the finger, too.\" Let the record show that Val does not give the finger.The Pony wanted Rally's for supper. He's spending the night with his grandma. So after making a payment at the savings and loan, we grabbed his food and headed to the real purpose of our trip: THE FROZEN CUSTARD STAND. Mom insisted on a toddler cone. She says it's just right. As if she's Goldilocks. I opted for a concrete made with chocolate custard and chocolate chips. It was breathtaking.When Mom rides in the passenger seat, she throws a monkey wrench into my routine. My purse has to move to the back floor by The Pony, and my giant yellow bubba cup of ice water must balance precariously over the hole of a regular-size cupholder between the seats. I use the other cupholder to harbor my concrete. However, when I first get it, I set it on the top of the console to let it melt down a little, so I don't get the sticky stuff above the rim on my fingers when I pick it up. Mom can hardly contain herself. No concrete shall ride unattended while SHE'S my copilot! Never mind that it has not once tipped over when I am by myself and have no helping mom-hand.So...we were pulling out, making a left as the flow of traffic allowed, and Mom was slurping her toddler vanilla with her right hand, and holding onto my concrete with her left. As I gassed T-Hoe to Frogger my way along the road until my next left, my bubba cup tipped to-and-fro like a badly beaten Bobo doll. Mom gave that auditory inhale that is her trademark in panic situations. I grabbed the bubba cup with my right hand to steady it, turning T-Hoe's wheel with my left like I had a 1950s suicide knob.\"I'm sorry, Mom, but you're going to need to sprout a third arm before I can bring you on a trip like this again.\"\"Oh, don't get me tickled!\"That's kind of her trademark, too.We took a shortcut through the Lowe's parking lot, where a family of five pointedly avoided the crosswalk to jaywalk diagonally from parking lot to door. It was all I could do to avoid them, what with driving on the wrong side of the road to maneuver around a red minivan parked facing the wrong way in my traffic lane. I wended my way out of that rat-maze to a residential street, and was promptly tailgated by a diesel pickup towing a race car trailer.\"I'm kind of glad that truck just turned. I was afraid it was that race driver who runs over people who anger him. Hey! Pony! Tell Grandma about our town experience, where that guy used inappropriate hand gestures.\"\"A car cut in front of two others to get to Domino's. That guy was yelling just like Mom does.\"\"Oh, I can't wait until YOU start driving! You'll have plenty to say. Or else people will be saying them about YOU!\"\"No they won't, Pony. I'm sure you'll be a very safe driver.\" Said Mom. As if she knows. Never having seen him almost take out the side of the BARn in a go-cart.By now we were on a straight stretch of road from one outer road to another. It's about a half mile, across an overpass, nary a view-obstructor in sight. Two pickups were parked on the shoulder as we turned, with two guys chest-to-chest having a discussion. All at once, the wiry guy pointed three fingers right in the face of the stocky guy. I think they were having a disagreement, because the wiry guy spun around and stalked back to his pickup. Mom said I should have pulled over to watch.\"What? This is not a barbershop parking lot.\" Mom was in the middle of asking me if Hick would be going to get another haircut tomorrow morning when it happened.Halfway to the next turn, as I was driving along at the speed limit, on my own side of the road, minding my T-Hoe business, a little silver SUV shot out like a heat-seeking missile from the side road on the left. SHOT OUT! And almost T-BONED my T-HOE! The front right bumper of that ballistic missile came within inches of my driver door. Thank goodness I swerved to the right shoulder. But you know what the kicker was?THAT MANIAC HAD THE NERVE TO HONK AT ME!Seriously. Since when does the car about to smash into your side honk at YOU? I was lawfully proceeding from Point A to Point B, nary a curve, nary a road sign to block the view. I have no idea what that maniac was thinking. That I had a stop sign, maybe? Don't know. But Maniac sat for a moment sideways in the oncoming lane, then pulled out and followed me at a considerable distance.\"Did you see that? What in the world? I can't believe that! Good thing my concrete was unharmed. Did you see that, Pony?\"\"Yeessss. I'm surprised you didn't go on about it like you always do.\"\"WHAT? I was NOT in the wrong!\"\"I know. I never said you were in the wrong. But sometimes I think you go too far complaining about things. And you didn't hardly say anything about THAT, compared to what you say about nothing.\"\"Yeah. Well. That Maniac is crazy. Must have been texting. Look how far back. I can hardly see the driver. Yeah. Must be a girl texting. Or else an old lady with really scraggly bleached hair, in which case she must be demented, and most likely dehydrated as well.\"When the Maniac caught up at a stop sign, I could see a little better. And when the Maniac decided, after sitting four cars back at the light, to suddenly veer into the right turn outlet, I deduced that the Maniac was a middle-aged drunk.Whew! A crash would not bode well for Val Thevictorian. Her thin blood would have flowed like water from a wide-open fireplug spigot.Does anybody have a thread-puller?

Hick is the one who uses the front door. He comes in from work through the kitchen, gets underfoot for a minute, then goes outside to tend his animals, and perhaps work a bit on his Little Barbershop of Horrors. Then he comes in either through the front or the kitchen with a handful of eggs, which he proceeds to rinse in my sink, a behavior which I have forbidden for nigh on four years now. It is not unusual for Hick to return to the wild after eating his supper that has been lovingly heated in the oven or warmed in the microwave by his faithful wife Val. Many's the time The Pony and I have heard the front door open and slam while we are watching our evening programs.Oh, the outrage! That front door was left unlocked ALL DAY! Never mind that sometimes when I ascend from my dark basement lair in the wee hours, I see the knob is unlocked, and turn it to secure the homestead.

Seems in his flurry of packing during the one day he had between the end of his summer job, and leaving for college for his RA training...he forgot the charger cable to his Surface. How he got by without it for these two weeks is a mystery to me. A mystery which I probably do not want to solve.He had sent me a text Sunday night. Not so much Sunday night as 12:06 Monday morning. A request for The Pony to check Genius's room for that cable plugged in by the bed, or laying nearby. Sounds simple, unless you know Genius and his stable of electronic gewgaws. I went to look, because, well, it was after 1:00 a.m. when I saw the text. Of course I couldn't find it. I don't even know what a Surface is.The Pony found that item toot sweet. I stuffed it in my school bag, just in case Genius decided to play the emergency card. Which he did. Texted me again saying he really needed that cable. So I told him I'd put it in the mail after school. Genius the experienced eBay seller told me to put it in a padded fixed rate priority mail envelope. Uh huh.I rushed to the post office (not the dead-mouse-smelling post office in Backroads proper, because I didn't have time nor gas money nor desire to go there) while The Pony was examining blood spatter at his new after-school club for science, technology, engineering, and math. Okay. It was not so much BLOOD spatter as CORN SYRUP AND RED FOOD DYE spatter.No one was in the lesser post office when I got there. I milled around looking at the packaging that took up one wall. I was not finding what my Genius sent me for. There was one employee working. I'm going to call him Slow Mike. No offense to the slow. Or to Mikes.\"I'm looking for a fixed rate priority mail envelope with padding.\" I saw where his eyes looked. There were none in that whole shelf deal.\"I don't see any.\"\"Oh.\" I went back to browsing, looking for something that might substitute. There was a little box that would hold the charger. It might rattle around inside, because I was NOT going to buy a roll of bubble wrap at the post office. You'd think Slow Mike could have offered me some of those shredded envelopes and magazine particles missing from the mail I get in a plastic bag with a sticker that says it arrived that way.But Slow Mike was not interested in me. The customer. A man came in looking lost. He wandered around the packaging, too, and grabbed something not fixed rate, and went to the end of the counter to stuff an object inside. He was from the Slow family, too, from the looks of his endeavors.\"My son said to mail it in a padded envelope. Is there anything else that could work?\"\"If you let me get rid of this guy, I'll look in the back. I thought we had some.\" Let the record show that the new guy who had wandered in did not take offense to being \"gotten rid of\" at all. Slow Mike took at least five minutes to send a registered letter for him. Then he disappeared into the back. Then he sprinted across the door to the other side of the back. Then he asked somebody something back there. Then he came out with an envelope. \"Found one.\" He put it on the counter.Oh, dear. It was white, as thin as a working girl's slip, with a lining of half-bubble wrap. I put the charger in there, and it clunked on the counter. This envelope was like a 9.5 x 11 manilla. Except white and dainty. I had no choice. I sealed the top. Slow Mike was fiddling with some electronic data entry.\"Here. I have the address on this note card. If you have some clear tape, you can just stick it on the envelope.\" Let the record show that Val has excellent printing penmanship, and is often told that she should be a draftsman. Or draft horse. One of those two. Slow Mike was not pickin' up what Val was layin' down. As in, he was not picking up that note card to affix it to the envelope. He looked really confused. Even for a slow guy. He pushed a little sticker at me. Like you might get at a convention, that says, \"Hello. My Name is ___________.\" Only it just said \"To:\" and \"From:\"\"Do you want me to copy this address onto that sticker?\"\"Yeah. That would be easier.\" In the meantime, Slow Mike took my address note card and started typing in data. \"That will be $5.80.\" I paid him. He even gave me the correct change. Then he held out the note card. \"Which address is right? There are two.\"Paula Deen in my front yard eating a lobster tail! How can a postal worker not understand how addresses work in a post office? I have taken the civil service test for mail carrier. Piece of cake. You have to put addresses in order. And the first thing that little exam preparation book tells you is that you read the address from the bottom up. General to specific.\"There are not two addresses. See? The envelope will go to this city. Then to this street. Then to this dorm. Then to my son. It all belongs there.\" Slow Mike grunted. I stifled down my disgruntledness. I got that card back from him as soon as he was done entering what was probably the wrong info in the system. I moved over to copy down the address on the convention sticker. The guy from the other end of the counter moved over for service.\"I want to send this to India.\"\"Um. Just a minute. I'm not sure how to do that.\" Slow Mike got on the microphone and called for a lady from the back. She came out. Apparently Slow Junior had not packed his item correctly after all this time. The lady, let's call her Smarty, squeezed Slow Junior's package. NOT LIKE THAT! This is not a pr0n flick. No boom chicka wow wow.\"This is a cell phone.\"\"Uh huh. I sold it to a guy in India. He already put the money in my PayPal account. Now I need to send it to him.\"\"This is a cell phone. It has a lithium battery.\"\"I don't know if it has a lithium battery. Let me call my son.\"\"All cell phones have lithium batteries. We can't ship them by air.\"\"Then how will it get to India?\"\"I don't think we can send it there by ground.\" Maybe she shouldn't be called Smarty.\"I'll take the battery out. Let me call my son and see how.\"It was like watching a tennis match. Not at the championship level. Slow Mike's head must have been hurting. \"Are you done with that?\" He reached for my label. Then he kind of stood there, watching the Great India Phone Caper unfold. I had to get back to school to pick up The Pony.I wanted to back out, keeping my eye on Slow Mike. But I didn't. I'm on blood thinners you know. So I couldn't risk a collision with another patron. I really hope Slow Mike put that sticker on the right package.I don't want Genius's Surface cable flying to India."}, {"title": "Ain't THAT a Fine Stringer o' Fish?", "date": "Tuesday, August 26, 2014", "text": "Perhaps I've mentioned once or twice that Hick likes to hit the auction circuit a couple of times a week. He always finds some treasure or other. Hick is not one to come home empty-handed from the hunt. No Auction Meat? No problem. He can find other stuff to buy.Like this:Ain't they purty?I suppose they could be called Wood Bass. This is one of the few gewgaw knickknack gimcrack whatnots he has hauled home that I actually kind of cotton to. He got them for five dollars. That's less than two dollars a fish!According to Hick, a stringer alone would be five or six dollars itself at Walmart. Like he shops.You might notice that Hick posed with his catch-of-the-night in front of his future Little Barbershop of Horrors. That's not his name for it. That's blog buddy Sioux's name for it. Which is frighteningly appropriate. I don't know how Hick made his hand look like it has five fingers and a thumb. It's just one of his freaky skills, I guess. And you might notice that he does not manscape his forearm. Which is all we'll say about that.When asked what he plans to do with his catch, Hick replied, \"Hang 'em in my barbershop!\"Of course.

Or maybe that's just how they smell. But anyhoo...Val knows how they feel. Not stinky, of course. But she's pickin' up what they're layin' down. You don't want to change anything when a particular facet of your life is going well. Not that athletes know what a facet is. Are you kidding? They don't even know what a faucet is! Have you smelled some of those guys? But seriously...The first full week of school just about put a nail in Val's coffin. It was all I could do to drag myself through the day. Not to mention the week. I think it's my medicine. The one I'm supposed to be on until May. We'll see about that. On Monday, I was so achy in the knees that I could hardly walk. My stomach hurt. I was nauseous, weak, exhausted, and in tears on the way to school and on the way home. That is not Val's style. Believe it or not, I really do like my job. Sure, maybe you could see why I might cry about coming home to Hick's shenanigans...but that's totally not me. I had to lie down for a half hour to regain my strength before I could go about my household duties.So I did what any sensible person who dodged death by pulmonary embolisms would do, and quit taking my blood-thinner. Not forever. I stopped for three days. The doctors tell you that, you know. To stop if you're going to the dentist, or having surgery. \"Oh, no. It won't hurt you. You'll be fine!\" Yeah. So I stopped for three days. And I was fine. And I could walk normally, and my head was clear, and I was no more tired than a normal work day after a summer off. It was glorious. But Friday I went back on that thinner. Saturday and Sunday were miserable again, joints aching, unable to sleep without turning often, neck pain, unsteadiness. And this morning, this MONDAY morning...I felt kind of okay.I don't know what's going on here. I'm planning to see my regular doctor so he can check with my lung doctor to see if there's a lower dose, or if I can simply switch to aspirin as promised, way back on my hospital bed, after three months on the blood-thinner.Since today was kind of okay, I am trying to be a thin-blooded athlete and not vary my routine from yesterday. Maybe I can keep feeling all right for a while. I'll admit, I stopped short of walking through Walmart for forty-five minutes like I did yesterday. But I'm trying to eat the same things, spend the same amount of time sitting at the computer, sitting in the recliner, standing in the kitchen, etc. I also stopped short at counting the number of black olive slices I put on my super nachos. That would just be silly. I don't know how many I had on there last night.Now I must prepare to fast-forward through my recording of the Cardinals game, eat a few Twizzler bites, fall asleep in the basement recliner from 10:10 until 1:00, and sleep in my bed from 1:15 until 4:50.Stand back.

He decided that he does not want to load his hay bales in the Gator at the BARn, and drive them over to the goat pen for the goats and minipony. While it's no big deal in summer, fall, or spring, I can imagine this task to be unpleasant in the winter.Hick had some scrap lumber that he picked up from work a while back, and more from here and there that he used to set Genius to pulling nails from. Genius, though reluctant, was a much better Hick's Apprentice than The Pony. He also had some roofing tin left over from some project that he coerced his oldest son to climb up on the roof and attach. Hick is now putting the finishing touches on his structure, having bought $140 worth of plywood and screws on Friday. Which is not to say that his creation looks like a finished product.Today I said something to Hick about his hay shed.\"Oh. It's not a hay shed anymore. I'm going to make it my barber shop. I'll put my barber chair in there, and a bunch of my auction stuff.\"So basically, he's been building himself a playhouse. Never mind that Hick is not a barber. He has an old-timey chair that he got about 15 years ago. He has clippers, which he used on his sons before they got wise to what they looked like after a shearing. And he has a knack for talking. He's always said that one day he wants to open a barber shop. He even went so far, when quizzed by me on why places like that must have proprietors with a license, as to suggest enrolling in the beauty school just up the road a piece. So he could get a barber's license alongside 18-year-old girls learning to cut hair.I think this shed is more of a project like his one-room schoolhouse he built down by the creek. He's not really teaching school out of it. Then again, I can't be sure Hick is not planning to put that barber shop on a trailer and haul it around to give impromptu haircuts, picking up stakes just ahead of inspectors from the State Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners. I suppose my first clue might be when he brings home a barber pole.Maybe he's going to pull that little shop of Hick-horrors to town, onto the parking lot of his regular barber shop, and siphon off a little business until Johnny comes out and kicks his butt. And while we're revisiting Johnny's, let me share a disappointing fact. I found out at the faculty lunch table last week that there really IS a waiting period of two hours at Johnny's on a Saturday morning! Found it out from another dude who, like Hick, has barely enough hair to cut.So there you have it. Hick hoodwinked me into believing he was building a hay shed, spent money I did not give him, and emerged from the ordeal with a sweet little barber shop.I don't know what the goats and minipony will have to say about this."}, {"title": "Internet Means Never Having to Pay Your Billing", "date": "Saturday, August 23, 2014", "text": "Greetings, all, from Deadbeat Val. You remember Deadbeat Val, don't you? The one who did not pay her DISH bill in July, right after switching her internet service to DISH and having that installer guy bend the downspout, and got an automated call telling her that her account was past due?So she looked back in her trusty checkbook register, and saw that the phone was right! Indeed, Deadbeat Val had not paid her July bill because she did not receive her July bill. She immediately called DISH and paid by credit card within five minutes of that phone recording, figuring that her Clearasil-stealing mailman or the dead-mouse-smelling post office had delivered that bill to the wrong box. Or perhaps a rural thief had helped himself to EmBee's innards, like that year one stole both electric bills, the telephone bill, and Deadbeat Val's back-to-school letter with important dates and new hires and contract adjustments.So this morning, Deadbeat Val was puttering around with the automated service for her checking account, trying to balance that account which has not balanced even one time, since Deadbeat Val became Mrs. Never-Record-a-Transaction Hick. But that's okay. Because Deadbeat Val leaves a pillowy cushion of funds in that account, just in case.So after checking up on the checking account, and then calling her single credit card automated service to prepare for bill-paying Friday next week...it dawned upon Deadbeat Val that she had not received her DISH bill for August. Surely it was time. Time to be reminded that she owed for not only her TV usage, but also for her internet connection.So Deadbeat Val looked back in her stash of statements, and saw that her DISH bill used to be mailed out on the 10th of the month. What with today being the 23rd of the month, Deadbeat Val smelled something stinky in Backroads. She picked up that phone and called the DISH customer service number. It really did not want her to talk to a person. But after perseverance, Deadbeat Val reached Marquis.Marquis was a lovely young man, so polite, with a barely discernible accent, so unlike those customer service reps \"Susan\" and \"Bob\" who gave Genius such a hard time trying to sort out some HP computer warranty nonsense at the tender age of ten. While waiting for them to return from checking with a supervisor, Genius turned to me and said, \"I don't really think they are giving me their real names.\"So Marquis asked how he could help me, and I explained that I had not received my paper bill for the month of July, and I still did not have it for the month of August. I told him that all I wanted was to receive my bill so I could pay it on time. That must be an uncommon request for DISH, because Marquis said he would access my account, and then said, \"So you have a question concerning your most recent bill of $XXX.xx?\"So I told him no, that first of all I did not even know the amount of my bill because I NEVER RECEIVED ONE. I had no issue with the amount, because I did not know the amount. Poor Marquis. He just was not picking up what I was laying down, as The Pony would have termed it, thinking that all people talk the way they did back in their high school days of hippyism, as he has previously insinuated. I told Marquis that all I wanted was to get a bill in the mail so I could pay it on time.So Marquis said, \"I see here that you do not get bills by mail.\" And I told him that I most certainly did, for the past fifteen years, at this same address, and had paid every one on time except for that last one in July that I never received. And Marquis said, \"I am looking at your account right now, and the box for paper billing is checked 'No.'\" I told Marquis that I WANT PAPER BILLING. And he suddenly understood. \"I am checking that box 'Yes' and sending you a copy of your bill for this month.\" A copy of the bill I never got.So I thanked Marquis, and patted myself on the back for being so proactive as to go on a search for my bill before I even got a call that it was past due.Deadbeat Val leaves no stone unturned in maintaining her excellent credit rating.

And you know that THAT means!DRILLS!Uh huh. What better time to cram in all the emergency drill procedures that the first full week of classes? Gotta get those kiddos ready to run.

Those poor freshmen must think we are the unluckiest campus in the world.It's the fire escape that commanded my attention. All because of The Pony. He stuck his Kindle Fire under my nose last night. \"Look at this.\" I was in the middle of something which I can't remember, but nothing more important than interacting with my youngest son, who rarely comes forward and shares with me, preferring to have information drug out of him by hook or by crook.\"Oh. That's nice.\" It was one of his classmates, standing in front of a whiteboard in The Pony's last class of the day. I was surprised that he had bothered to take a picture on his Kindle Fire. Which is kind of ironic, I suppose. You be the judge when you hear all the facts. If there's one thing Val's not an expert on, it's irony.\"Look at her.\"\"I did. Why did you have your Kindle out taking pictures? I thought that wasn't allowed.\"\"It was this time. See?\"I looked again. The poor little gal had a sign around her neck. A homemade laminated sign. Which declared that she had just burned to death in a fire, and nobody even noticed. Then I understood. When we have drills, the drill-holders spirit away a few kids and hide them. Just to test us. One year a big strapping basketball player was told to lay down in the classroom during an earthquake drill, and refuse to leave the building. \"I'm hurt!\" he declared. \"My leg is broken. I can't walk.\" The teacher thought he was pulling a prank. She grew quite agitated. Demanded that he get up, the fun was over. She tried to pull him out the door. He screamed that she was hurting his broken leg. By the time the support staff came by to check her room, she was in tears, almost hysterical. But she received high praise, because she did not abandon her student.\"How did that happen? Didn't you tell the teacher that she was missing?\"\"Not my job.\"\"What about her friends?\"\"No. They didn't say a word. And they're her really good friends, too.\"\"I guess they WERE. Now she's burned up. How could your teacher not know? We have to take our rosters and take roll.\"\"Our teacher is also in charge of the kids in the room next door. The ones who take web classes. She got all of them. She took a picture of her seating chart so she would have it on her phone when she went out, but the phone cut the little burned-up girl's name off the picture.\"Huh.

The salt and pepper and mustard and a large clear plastic bowl of dill pickle chips and a can of industrial-strength ketchup with a pump on top sit on a cart in the cafeteria, near the exit door from the kitchen lunch line.

They'd like it about as well as these lunches.\"\"I know!\"This morning I asked The Pony if he knew that kids are not allowed to have salt in the cafeteria.\"Uh huh. It doesn't bother me. I bring my lunch. But some of them are going crazy. We can't have salt because we can't handle it. Put air quotes around that. I'm being sarcastic. But that's what the cooks told one of the kids when he asked for salt.\"Maybe, if the cooks were allowed to actually start cooking food again, and could slop it on the trays in amounts the students can enjoy, and stop warming up this over-processed pre-packaged garbage they are forced to buy from the cheapest vendor...sodium would not be an issue.Just sayin'."}, {"title": "To the Victorian, None of the Spoils", "date": "Wednesday, August 20, 2014", "text": "It was, perhaps, notthe best time to bring it up.Before work, inpassing, like two ships in the morning, I reminded Hick of an eye doctorappointment next Tuesday, filled him in on my last communication with Genius,confessed that I did not take my blood-thinner last night on purpose, andoff-handedly mentioned that The Pony\u2019s senior ring will be here next Thursday.That\u2019s the thing withthose rings.

Only 173 days left for me. That's 172 for the kids.Yes, I returned to work last Monday for the annual all-school catered breakfast and full-day meetings. Let me tell you this about that: festival seating is not my friend.Every year, from way back when I was but a toddler learning at the knee of my best ol' ex-teaching buddy Mabel, our little group sat at the same table. Sure, maybe there was one year when we sat at the one right next to it. But we were creatures of habit. Anybody could tell you where anybody else would be sitting. As a precaution, I was assigned table duty. That's because my room was the closest to the cafeteria. So I would go in about 20 minutes before meeting time and mark our territory with a folder, itinerary, pencil, pen, water bottle, set of keys. Reserved. That's just how it was. Until this year.Perhaps I grew lax. Fat and sassy from years of giant cinnamon rolls. Perhaps the cinnamon rolls are to blame. We have not had them for several years, since our caterer went out of business. Scrambled EggBeaters full of red and green peppers are not such a drawing card. So excuse me if I was five minutes late in going out to stake our claim. We're down to only three regulars now, anyway, for the breakfast.OUR TABLE WAS TAKEN!TAKEN! Like seats at a showing of Checkmate at the Paragon, until Elaine was overpowered and had to go watch Rochelle, Rochelle at the Paradise Twin.What a fine kettle of fish THAT was! Nobody ever wanted our seats. Until now. Because this year, we were the row that was allowed to feed first at the breakfast buffet. Uh huh. Every year, a different row of tables gets that privilege. I swear the sequence is written in stone and given to Price Waterhouse for safekeeping. So now I had let my cronies down. All I could do was stake out the very long 8-person table vacated by the usurpers. How pitiful it looked, three seats saved.I abandoned my post to go sign in at the table out front by the trophy case. Of course it's nothing as simple as signing next to your name on a printed list. You must go down the table gauntlet, like a child in a birthday party spanking machine, except nobody touches your butt. There are MSTA reps to contend with. I don't go for that check-withholding stuff, so I am one of four folks who get their form and send it in with a check. For this outlay of low three-figures, I am allowed to pick up a pocket calendar with the MSTA logo.What I really wanted was the little mini flip-top spiral notebook. To get that, I had to join CTA. I have a love-hate relationship with CTA. That's the Community Teachers Association, I believe. Our local organization. I don't mind forking over ten bucks to join. But I draw the line at forking over thirty bucks. Which is what happened one year when I paid the building rep, who gave it to the treasurer but forgot to record it, then put me on the delinquent pay list round about December, so I paid again, because nobody believed me, only to find myself put on notice like a check-kiter on a convenience store cash register list in April for not having paid my dues. I put my foot down. Demanded that records be checked so I could be allowed to vote on next year's calendar without paying triple. Well. What do you know? The records showed that I had already paid twice that year. So I was handed ten dollars and allowed to vote.Woe was me. I had only a five and four ones in my pocket this back-to-school breakfast morning. What I wanted to say was, \"I will gladly pay you one of these days for a membership today.\" But I didn't. You know they would have not appreciated my smart-buttiness. So I looked really sad, and said, \"I only have nine dollars. But I can bring you a dollar tomorrow.\" Because you know if I waited to pay until tomorrow, that sweet swag pile would be gone, baby, gone!The rep and treasurer looked at each other. Like they didn't know where to find me to break my legs with a baseball bat if I didn't pay up. \"I guess that's okay. Go ahead and take a notebook.\" The librarian was sitting at the end of the table. \"I'll cover it for you.\" I snagged a little blue spiral, happy as a clam. There was a pile of Sharpie Accent Pocket Style Highlighters in the colors of the rainbow, but I did not push my luck. Imagine my chagrin when I returned to my breakfast table in the middle of the cafeteria and saw that some people had three mini-spirals and a couple of highlighters.Even Steven then smiled upon me, because instead of my new breakfast table going to the buffet last, as per the usual schedule...we were sent second! I guess even Price Waterhouse screws the pooch some days. And I was again rewarded by a pan of EggBeaters that did NOT have peppers, and was not floating in steam water. Uh huh. I had some eggs, bacon (though it was as see-through and floppy as onionskin paper), sausage links, biscuit, gravy, cantaloupe chunks, and watermelon cubes. It was actually tasty, and I was finished before the speakers began.Then the day took a dastardly turn again. We finished that three-hour meeting with fifteen minutes to spare. An announcement was made that we should report for the technology meeting in the main computer lab. I took time for a potty break, which would have been so much easier from my other table, since it is where we can sneak out unnoticed during the PowerPoints to do our business. I grabbed a bottle of water, and paper for taking notes, and my laptop, which was a required item. I scrounged four quarters from my top desk drawer, and hurried to the CTA treasurer to clear my debt. Didn't want my mini-spiral to be repossessed. Then I headed on down to the lab to get a good seat. One my my cronies was there, also. We grabbed the prime area where the desktops had been moved aside. Three other colleagues were chatting, waiting for stuff to start. Then another came in and announced, \"Um, the meeting is in the library, and the guy is waiting for everybody so he can start.\"Well. Wasn't that a fine how-do-you-do! This misdirection was bigger than the Great Mabel Chinese Buffet Lunchtime Debacle. We snatched up our stuff and hurried across the hall. Thank goodness the only people at our regular table there were the tech guys. I shoved my laptop down and said, \"Oh, are you guys sitting here?\" They retreated to the back of the room, to the counter along the wall with the library desktops. Touche'. Score one for Val.The rest of the day was fairly uneventful. Will I make sure to stake out my table earlier next year during the back-to-school breakfast? Not likely. Nobody will want the area that goes last.Besides. It will be my last year.

I'm sure he doesn't need a haircut every week. He barely even has hair. But that's always his excuse when he leaves at 7:00 and doesn't return until 10:00 or 11:00.At 9:40, Hick called to report that he was going to drop off his prescriptions at the pharmacy, then go look around Goodwill for a while.\"What have you been doing for over two-and-a-half hours?\"\"Getting a haircut.\"\"Sure. You wouldn't even wait that long for a doctor's appointment.\"\"It takes time, Val. I have to wait. There are always ten or twelve guys there.\" Sure. On a Saturday morning, there's a rush on haircuts. I've seen that shop. You can look right in the window. There's not even ten chairs around the walls for waiters. No pool table. No magazines. Just the barber chair in the center, and a few red nondescript chairs ringing the walls for waiters to sit in.\"That's hard to believe.\" It's not like Hick is getting a haircut from Jose Eber. It's some good ol' boy who has this box-like building at a 4-way stop, catty-corner from an auto parts store, across one street from an abandoned former gas station that used to do car inspections in the manner of \"You pay me, your car passes,\" and across the other street from a tiny decrepit trailer where sno cones are dispensed at odd hours on various days, depending on the mood of the proprietress.\"I shoot the bull with the other guys until it's my turn.\" Hard to believe Hick is always last, what with leaving home at 7:00 for the ten-minute trip.\"This morning we saw a fight! A car pulled into the parking lot with another car right on its tail. At first I thought a woman got out. That it was some kind of domestic abuse she was running away from. Then we saw it was a little guy with gray hair. A big guy jumped out of the second car and started screaming, 'You pulled right out in front of me and almost made me wreck!' The Big Guy looked to be about 40, and started swinging at the Little Guy. The Little Guy fought back. He was actually getting the best of it, even though he looked around 60. We all ran out to watch. The Big Guy was about my size. He threw his keys at the Little Guy's face, and they bounced off, and hit Johnny the Barber's truck! Johnny got mad then. 'Mister, now you're messing with my truck. I've got a problem with that.' He stepped up to the Big Guy. Johnny's a big boy. He's about a head-and-a-half taller than that Big Guy. So the Big Guy said okay, and held up his hands, and left. He didn't want no part of Johnny.\"\"They told me to call the police while it was happening. I dialed 311, the non-emergency number, and nobody answered. Anyway, by then, both guys were gone. We all went back inside to talk about it. Johnny said, 'Nothing like that has ever happened here.' And I told him, 'Yeah, but I bet that's not the first fight that parking lot has saw.' It used to be a bar right across the street.\"Can you imagine Hick calling the NON-emergency number for the police? Because when a fight just erupted on the barber shop parking lot, what you want is the dispatcher to tell the cops, \"You can put your feet up and have another donut. It's not an emergency. You can drop by later and see what's going on.\"There you have it. What really goes on when Hick leaves early in the morning and does not return for hours. Apparently, there's some kind of fight club in Backroads. Now Hick has violated the first law of fight club.I imagine his punishment will result in being moved to the end of the haircutting line next Saturday."}, {"title": "Like Sands Through the Hourglass, This is the Delivery of Our Mail", "date": "Friday, August 15, 2014", "text": "Ahhhh...Friday! That's one week of school under my belt. And since the week of school consisted of only two days, I had plenty of room under that belt for some frozen custard!The Pony and I met my mom on her church parking lot, and proceeded to the not-very-good-but-at-least-nearby custard stand. For the record, The Pony had a chocolate sundae, Mom had a vanilla cone, and I had a Hawaiian Delight concrete made with chocolate custard. It was not so much of a delight. More of a surprise. Who puts strawberries in a Hawaiian concrete? I was expecting bananas and pineapple and coconut, but not the added strawberries. Quite curious, the license this treat-purveyor takes with my taste buds.But this is not about my afternoon delight. This is about THE MAIL.We usually get our mail between 11:00 and 1:00. I know that, because all summer when I drove to town each day for a beverage or some lottery tickets or to pick up a package at the dead-mouse-smelling post office, I would stop for the mail when I returned home. So when The Pony and I got behind a car stopped at a mailbox near the beginning of our county road this evening, I thought it was kids fooling around.Let the record show that the time was 4:45 p.m. The car was a white, newer-model Jeep. Not a fancy Jeep like a Cherokee or anything of that sort. A regular Jeep with a hard top and a short wheelbase. It used to be called a Jeep CJ5, as opposed to the long wheelbase Jeep CJ7 that my dad had in baby blue with a wide dark-blue stripe and a black hardtop.So...the white Jeep pulled over at a roadside mailbox with its flashers on. A blond girl yanked open the mailbox door and shoved in an envelope. She shoved the door shut, but it fell down. She left it, and the driver proceeded to the next mailbox. She was blond, too.\"Look, Pony. Those girls are putting stuff in mailboxes. At first I thought they were delivering the paper. But you can't put that in a mailbox. You have to have a little container by\u00a0 itself for the paper. So they must be stuffing invitations or some political ads in the mailboxes along here. That's against the law.\"\"Huh.\" Said The Pony. All interested and such. I don't even think he turned his head to see that single white envelope the gal had put in the gaping mailbox.We finally got around the Jeep. I looked in my rearview mirror. Yep. They even stopped at the old cow-lady's house. So much for the invitation theory. Must be political.\"We'll get our mail, and then sit on the gravel road by the creek until they come along. Then we will know for sure what they're putting in the mailboxes.\"\"Huh.\" Said The Pony. Not at all his bubbly after-school self, who only yesterday agreed with my every statement, in fact telling me, \"I'm a-pickin' up what you're layin' down. As you people would say back in your era.\"I pulled over near EmBee's mailbox row. The Pony hopped out and trotted over to peer into her gullet. He looked at me with not very much fondness at all. \"No mail.\"We turned onto the gravel and waited for that Jeep. In the down time, The Pony revealed that his phone was dead. At least that means he had been socializing by device, and was disappointed that he could no longer socialize by device until he got home to his charger.The Jeep topped the hill and sped down to EmBee. One of the blond gals climbed out and fished around in the back seat for more envelopes. After they finally filled up all residents of mailbox row, the Jeep sped away again. The Pony trotted back to see what was inside EmBee.IT WAS OUR REGULAR MAIL!What in the Sam Hill is going on here? Why such a late delivery? And these blondies didn't even have a U.S. Mail magnetic sticker on their bumper.I almost expect a delivery on Sunday by a cheerful whistling substitute.Neither rain, nor snow, nor sleet, nor hail shall keep the postwomen from their appointed rounds.

Fat and sassy, hobbling around with thin blood, on knees that creak and argue because the Tibia-Fibula family wants to go one way, and Old Man Femur wants to go another. Yes. Except for the aching bones and muscles, which I know are a side effect even though the pharmaceutical family does not list it right up there with sudden death, I have resigned myself to life until May as a thin-blooded person.Sure, I still curse at drivers coming at me over the center line, and take one hand off the wheel to shake my fist at them for almost killing me in a collision that would result in my blood spouting like Old Faithful...but I have kind of forgotten that I'm taking a blood-thinner.Until last night.I have been very careful, you see, not to bump or slice or internally injure myself. For three months I have survived life's jostling without incident.Until last night.Hick built my desk space in my dark basement lair. It's a corner affair. Hick put in two sets of cabinets with drawers, and laid some butcher-block laminated countertop across them. So I can have a high desk with a stool (salvaged by Hick from a bar). Then he put in two sections of V-shaped countertop in the corner, lower, so I can sit in my rolly chair at my New Delly in that V, with comfortable counter space upon which to rest each arm. No carpal tunnel syndrome for Val! Hick put in another high section on top of a cabinet at my right hand, holding my laser printer. It's the next best thing to an apartment with no furniture, only levels covered by a bunch of pillows, favored by hipster doofuses.Last night, as I reached to the left for my glasses in their case on the upper counter, I raked my left forearm against the corner of the countertop. I heard a scraping noise, kind of like an icepick across old leather.Did you know that thin blood flows out quite quickly? Sorry, Best Ol' Ex-Teaching Buddy Mabel, for that description. It wasn't exactly a river. That's because there were just two little spots, about as far apart as snake fangs, that went deeper into the scratch. Blood bubbled up and dripped over the side of my arm. I dabbed at it with some Puffs With Aloe. After a couple of times, the spouting turned to little bubbles that got a coating and stopped flowing. I left them to harden.This morning, after my shower, I saw that my blood was again flowing like syrup from a mighty Maple. I slapped a BandAid on it and went off to my first day of school. Not that I was trying to attract attention to my infirmity. For that, I would have put a fancy Angry Birds BandAid on it at work. Nope. Just the flesh-colored one, which matches nobody's flesh, unless that body was born in a Crayola Crayon box with the last name of Flesh, whose parents changed the family name to Peach.I'm going to take it off later tonight. The BandAid, that is! Don't get your hopes up.

WAIT! That's not right. That's what happens when I just fly in from Tulsa. But I DID just get back from the doctor, with a glowing report after my recent outpatient surgery, and an appointment for February, I don't know why, now that I'm healed after never even being sick in that department. Oh, well. Those sick days aren't going to use themselves, huh, Mabel?Do you know how much I hated leaving school early today to get to that appointment? Yeah. About this much, though I might be overestimating my sorrow.On the way back, nigh on 2:30 p.m. according to T-Hoe's sundial (okay, T-Hoe has as many gadgets as a Swiss Army Knife, but a sundial isn't one of them--I'm fibbing), we stopped for lupper. That's because we missed lunch, and I was not about to volunteer to make supper a couple hours after eating.Hick started out looking for Outback Steakhouse. As with so many of Hick's grand schemes, he could not find the Outback. So he did the next best thing...took me to a little Chinese restaurant next to the Goodwill store. I think he said Goodwill. It could have been a flea market or antique store for all I know. And if the little Chinese restaurant had been a snake, it would have bit him, as far as Hick knew. He kept talking about it, and driving around a strip mall (that's little shops in a long building, not an adult entertainment area), saying he had eaten there and the food was really good, but he just couldn't seem to remember where it was.\"Oh, do you mean Liu Shun Wok?\"\"Yeah. I guess so. Do you see it?\"\"Right there.\"\"Yeah. That's it. It's not a buffet. Just a little place. But the food was good. I think.\"You might think that with \"Shun Wok\" in the name, it might be best to continue looking for the outback. But the food in that little restaurant was quite delicious. We had the lunch special for $4.65. That's right. $4.65! Can't beat that with a stick! Can't beat that with Val-in-a-Recliner! For our $4.65, I had the stir-fried cashew chicken with steamed rice, two crab rangoon, and hot-and-sour soup. Hick had the Hunan chicken with fried rice, two crab rangoon, and hot-and-sour soup. Perhaps I've mentioned that I'm a big fan of hot-and-sour soup. This was fantastic! I daresay it was better than my favorite here in Backroads. Hick, not normally a fan of soup that is liquid, also enjoyed it. I had him pegged for an egg-drop man, but he slurped up every drop of his hot-and-sour liquid.There was just one problem. I'm used to drinking my soup, not eating it with a round soup spoon. Of course I couldn't do that in public, out of a glass bowl, rather than in my dark basement lair, out of a plastic quart container. Still, the soup was tasty. As was my cashew chicken. Did I say there was only one problem? Make that two. On my second bite of steamed rice with cashews, chicken, celery, and carrot...I broke a tooth. Maybe. There was a terrible, horrendous grinding clicking sound from my right jaw area. So loud that even Hick heard it, and he was told just this week that he has profound hearing loss and could benefit from a hearing aid. But I felt no pain. Not about Hick's hearing loss. About that white thing that I picked out of my mouth that Hick held out his hand for, inspected with his one eye, and declared that it COULD be a piece of tooth, or a piece of rice that wasn't steamed, or a piece of bone from the dicing of the chicken. Mmm...doesn't that make you want to run out to Liu Shun Wok? It should. Because that food was a tasty bargain, and I did not begrudge the proprietors the possible breakage of my enamel. Yes, I continued eating.Let the record show that Hick and I were the only people in the restaurant. Hick said it seemed like a Mom and Pop place, but I thought it was more of a Mom and Son place. What it really reminded me of was Babu's Pakistani restaurant, the one very, very bad man Jerry Seinfeld encouraged him to open, which never had any customers besides Jerry and Kramer and perhaps Elaine taking an IQ test for George.I'm not trying to be a snob. But I don't think the health department had ever crossed the threshold of Liu Shun Wok. I looked at my plate, and then at Hick's plate. Mine was plain white (well, many years ago I imagine it had been white, which had kind of faded to gray) and Hick's had a faint pattern of a flower etched upon it.\"I think our plates came from Goodwill.\"\"It wouldn't surprise me. You can buy dishes all day long at the auction, for two, three dollars for a set. I never buy dishes unless there's one that I really like.\"I'm sure Goodwill washes the dishes before they sell them, right? Anyhoo...the meal was very flavorful, and the service good enough. When we went in and sat down, I had told Hick, \"This looks like a small businessman trying to make a go of it. Short of finding bugs in the food, you should leave a decent tip.\" Even though I found a surprise in my food or mouth, I was still game for the tip. Hick left four dollars.My mom would have been outraged. She thinks two dollars is the proper amount of tip for a full service meal, no matter what the cost."}, {"title": "Eight Pens a Day", "date": "Tuesday, August 12, 2014", "text": "Sing that.

My first day back at work was a scorcher. It's not as if I was stringing electrical cables across the Mojave Desert. I was in a climate-controlled building. But the temps outside were frightful. So humid this morning, 90 percent when we left home, and temperatures in the seventies before 7:00 a.m.As is my way, I bump up the thermostat when we're going to be away from the house all day. Our old thermostat used to have a program for that, but I don't think this new one does. You know. The new one the heating & cooling guy put on the wall when he \"fixed\" the air conditioner last summer, saying our thermostat was not working, and taking it with him in his truck. I'm sure some customer from Craig's List is enjoying it as I type. Anyway, this new thermostat requires a person to manually switch it from \"heating\" to \"cooling\" depending on the season. Crikey! It's like the stone age. Says the woman who still has no dishwasher.This morning, after my shower, and before my recliner nap, I bumped up that thermostat from the overnight setting of 73 to the daytime setting of 74. You wouldn't believe how refreshing one more degree of cool is overnight. When The Pony and I started out the door for work, I put the thermostat on 78. No need to cool the house while we're away, only to have it dissipate and need cooling again every 20 minutes or so.When we returned this afternoon, The Pony went in first. As I came through the kitchen door, I hollered, \"Hey! Pony! Bump the air conditioner down to 74.\"\"Um. It's 75 in here. I can't bump it down to 74, because it's already set on 71. You forgot to lower it this morning.\"\"I did not! I set it at 78. There's no way it can be on 71. You're misreading it.\"\"YOU'RE the one who thought those turkeys in the neighbor's driveway were dogs! And just now, at the bank, thought that rolled-up green hose around the corner by the ATM was a car! YOU must not have seen it right this morning when you set it. Allegedly.\"\"I know what I put it on. I would never set it on 71 for the day. That's cooler than we have it at night!\"\"All I know is what I see. Right now, it's on 71.\"\"Well, put it up to 74. No way would the temperature in here be 75 if the thing had been set on 71 all day! I think you moved it down too far when you came in.\"\"No..ooo..ooo. I went to change it, but it was on 71.\"\"There's no way! It even feels hot in here. Put it on 74, and it will eventually go down a degree and shut off.\"\"Okaaayyyy!\" The Pony trotted downstairs to console himself with the two new computer games he bought while using Grandma's high-speed internet today. I cranked back in the La-Z-Boy to rest my achin' back that had been sitting all day.\"If you're talking about the thermostat, I just put it on 71 about 20 minutes ago.\"WTF?The voice came from the master bedroom, and sounded remarkable like Hick, who wasn't due home from work for another half hour.

You don't pull the mask off the ol' Lone Ranger...and you don't mess around with Val's thermostat.Let the record show that Hick had a doctor's appointment today, and came home early from work, and rolled himself up in my grandma's homemade quilt like a hot dog in a tortilla. His head was covered by the quilt, of course, as is his way of sleeping. He knows the temperature I set for the house. I am the bill-payer. He is the frivolous money-waster.

Not that he's done such a thing, of course. He asked first, and was refused permission.For the past several weeks, I have been finding sections of torn paper plate around the old homestead. In areas frequented by Hick. They are pieces of the plate edge, about the size of an orange slice, unless you're talking about those tiny oranges they give the kids on their school lunch tray, which are the size of premature baby clementines. Sometimes the torn crescent of paper plate rests upon a paper plate with a crescent torn out of it. Which is kind of like finding a book about coffee tables laying on your coffee table.I know why the paper plate rips. Hick uses the fragment for picking his teeth. Uh huh. Not very ladylike, I agree. He's kind of a Neanderthal. Not that Neanderthals had paper plates. I'm sure they had proper dishes for their womenfolk to wash up after a hard day of being dragged around by their hair.It's not like I expect Hick to sit at the right hand of Emily Post, sipping tea from a dainty cup, pinky extended. Or to know the proper sequence for chowing down with an 11-piece formal dinner silverware setting. I barely expect him to limit himself to letting only silent farts escape in crowded elevators. Seriously. There is no need to dig at one's bicuspids with a scrap of Great Value Heavy Duty Grease Resistant plate. Not when there is a nearly-full container of toothpicks in the kitchen cabinet. I know Hick knows they're there. Didn't he break the top off the last pack stored there, because he couldn't figure out that it slides open so you can shake out a toothpick? Great mechanical minds are not immune from stumping, it seems.Yes, this behavior is on par with that time Hick tilted his head back and shook the remaining crumbs from an individual bag of Lay's Potato Chips into his gaping maw, while sitting at a table along the main walkway from Harrah's hotel elevators to the casino. People watched him like he was an ape at the zoo. Thank goodness he didn't fling poop on them. Or that time he took me to McDermott's (now called Pat's Bar and Grill) for fried chicken, and proceeded to suck the tip of each finger and thumb loudly after each bite. Thank goodness most people in there were too sippy happy to notice.The only consolation for my discovery of Hick's recent spate of misbehavior is that when we dine in public, he can't break off a piece of his plate to use for picking his teeth."}, {"title": "Not Suitable Reading for Pregnant Women, Folks with Heart Conditions, or Scaredy Cats", "date": "Saturday, August 9, 2014", "text": "Sometimes, there are things more horrifying than discovering in the outpatient-surgery waiting room that the cracker crumbs on your husband's shirt are actually flakes of dry skin from his goatee.Like when you are making yourself a delicious plate of super nachos for your lupper, the chips all layered with shredded extra-sharp cheddar, fajita chicken, Save A Lot Senora Verde Mild Salsa, sour cream, and black olives...and you hear a tiny \"plop\" from somewhere to the left of your visual field.Oh, you might just think it's that 9x13 glass baking pan that you left on the stove from last night's Shake 'N' Bake pork steaks, heating up because it's on the burner, and you have the oven going to warm up your fajita chicken.

Somebody in that kitchen might have some 'splainin' to do if there's a big honkin' overage on the internet plan.I pried open my container with a serving spoon, and saw that my white rice and prok were covered with pepper beans like black spots on a dalmation. Huh. I spent the better part of ten minutes hunched over the kitchen counter like a bell-ringer from Notre Dame, picking those hot spots out of my meal. It was not an easy task. My back started to seize up like a Tin Man left out in the rain. I needed one of those wide Walmart belt-harness thingies to prevent injury.To make matters worse, not all the black pepper beans were in plain sight. I caught five of them hiding in a broccoli floret like clown fish in a sea anemone. In the way of my black pepper bean harvest were other assorted vegetables. Like those sweated strands of onion that were linked together at the middle like a centromere connecting sister chromatids during mitosis. And the mushrooms, for lack of a feather in their cap, concealed black pepper beans up under there. Working a double shift cleaning toxins out of puffer fish at a five-star restaurant would surely have been less taxing.However...I must admit that, once de-peppered, my Hunan Prok was quite tasty."}, {"title": "36 Hours: It Could Be a Series, Filled With Attempted Murder and Ineptitude", "date": "Thursday, August 7, 2014", "text": "Genius is home for 36 hours.Some might call it a day, or two days, or a day-and-a-half. But it's Genius we're talking about here. You're lucky I didn't calculate the seconds.This morning I took The Pony to registration at the high school. We left at 8:15, way before Genius rolled out of bed. I stopped by Hardee's to get The Pony some breakfast. On the way back, I was planning to run in Save-A-Lot for a couple things. I tried to call Genius, but he didn't answer. Once we parked at Save-A-Lot, I tried again.\"I don't want anything. All I did yesterday was eat.\"\"Okay. Are you going to be home for supper? I thought about making meat loaf. I know you like it.\"\"No. I'm going to a movie at 1:00, then surprising my friend's parents. He's at work until 5:30, but they haven't seen me in a long time.\"\"All right.\" I went about my business. When The Pony and I unpacked the stuff at home, Genius started nosing around.\"I can't believe you didn't get me anything!\"\"You didn't want anything!\"\"Well, I got up, and went to look for a Little Debbie brownie, and THE BOX WAS EMPTY!\"\"The Pony hasn't eaten them all summer. It was probably YOU who left the box empty last time you were here. I was going to get you some little donuts, but you didn't want anything.\"\"Oh, but you got HIM Hardee's!\"\"That was three hours ago. I don't think you would have wanted me to get you any then.\"\"What's this?\"Some kind of sugar-free drink for your dad. There are three kinds. You can have some if you want. He'll never know.\"They are all the same color. Mmm...strawberry lemonade! That's pretty good. Here. Try it.\"\"No thanks, Mr. Ebola. You're not going to trick me. You've only been on antibiotics since Tuesday night. I don't want your disease.\" \"Oh, yeah. That's right. Hey, I wanted some Golden Oreos!\"\"Do you think Save-A-Lot has brand names? They don't. But I DID get you these fake Girl Scout Thin Mints.\"\"Nom nom nom. I LOVE them!\"\"So, you're not going to be home for supper?\"\"I think I will.\"\"Too bad. There's nothing for you to eat. I got two pork steaks for Dad and me. Your brother is having corn dogs. I can make you super nachos, with fajita chicken, nacho cheese, sour cream, salsa, jalapenos, and black olives.\"\"I'll take corn dogs. What am I going to have for breakfast?\"\"The Pony has cinnamon toast every day.\"Genius rifled through the cabinets. \"Hey! Are we BUYING our cinnamon sugar now?\"\"No. That's an old shaker that your grandma gave you back when you were a kid. We just filled it up last week. What kind of millionaire do you think I am?\" \"Not a very good one?\"\"The kind of millionaire without much money. Get that toaster out from under the cabinets! You'll burn the house down!\"\"Blah blah blah.\" Genius busied himself watching Ridiculousness. I switched to Roseanne, to see a Halloween episode. \"I hate that show! I'm making some eggs.\"\"I almost bought some bacon for you, but you said you didn't want anything.\"\"I would LOVE to have some bacon with my eggs. But YOU didn't buy any. Now I'll have to use oil. That's not as good.\"\"Your dad fries HIS bacon in oil.\"\"Yeah. That's so wrong. All you need is bacon grease. Not oil to thin it out.\"\"What's that noise? That popping?\"\"Just my oil getting hot.\"\"That's TOO hot! It will get all over my stove and counter.\"\"Blah blah blah. I'm using the big pan. It's easier that way. Did you know your big pan is coming apart? The handle is half off.\"\"Well, I would tell you something, but I fear the consequences.\"\"Tell me.\"\"Um. It's coming apart? Huh. The bottom is all dirty now, too. I might just throw it away. But I'm afraid to tell you that, because I can picture you turning it over to look at the bottom, and spilling your eggs and oil all down the burner.\"\"You know, I probably would have done that. Where's the spatula?\"\"Where do YOU think it is? It can only be three places. It's either clean in the drawer, dirty on the counter, or clean in the sink.\"\"What do I do with this used oil?\"\"Take it out back and pour it off the back porch. WITHOUT spilling it all through the kitchen.\"\"Huh. If there's a chicken down on the ground, can I pour the hot oil on it? Fry it up right now, and miss a couple of steps?\"\"No.\"\"Whoa! You missed it. There really WAS a chicken down there. I had to stop myself when I saw it.\" Let the record show that Genius used a good glass plate to get all eggy with his three fried eggs. They were gone in less than three minutes.\u00a0\"Make sure you put that in the sink to soak.\"\"I AM!\"\"Too bad you lost my Stubs movie card. You could earn me points on your ticket, and get a discount on your movie snacks.\"\"I get in FREE. My friend works there. And I think we get snacks, too.\"\"What do you get?\"\"Probably a small slushie and small popcorn.\"\"Oh. What they give the kids when they go on a field trip.\"\"Maybe. I've got to get going. Can I have your bank card? I need to get some shoes and school supplies.\"\"It's in the purse. Don't go overboard. Remember what kind of millionaire I am. Anyway, I'll take it out of your account.\"\"What do you mean, TAKE IT OUT OF MY ACCOUNT?\"\"Your college savings. It's stuff for college.\"\"Oh. I thought you meant out of MY money.\"Funny how it only works one way, isn't it? Genius grabbed the plastic money and took off. I was just taking a deep breath, getting back to my life, when I heard someone on the porch and say a tall head at the glass thingamabob on top of the door. Great. What kind of stranger was up in here now? I knew I did not have any packages coming from that crazy UPS label-picture-drawing dude. I smoothed down my hair and went to open the door.It was Genius. \"Lock yourself out?\"\"Yes. You can open that knob from the inside, even when it's locked. That's the stupidest thing! You know, I could have died if I did this last night.\"\"I don't think so. It was 75 degrees. You could have slept on the back porch.\"\"Well, if it was winter,\u00a0 I could have died.\"\"You're the kind of Genius who isn't very smart."}, {"title": "From the Small World and Revenge Departments", "date": "Wednesday, August 6, 2014", "text": "The Pony and I stopped for haircuts today after his dentist appointment. Yes, we went to Terrible Cuts. I had a coupon. If I was smart, which obviously I'm not, I would have used the coupon on me today, then taken The Pony back tomorrow to use the $2.00 off savings from my receipt. Too bad, so sad. Hindsight is worth $2.00.The story today is not about our terrible cuts. They're actually presentable. The story is about the cutter. I had a new girl. That happens frequently at Terrible Cuts. In the middle of our haircuts, The Pony's gal asked if he was ready to go back to school. Of course he is. He's a Thevictorian, after all.My cutter asked what grade he is in. Seems that she has a brother in the same grade, at our same school. A brother who is one of The Pony's friends, who he competes with neck-and-neck in the math contest each year. Small world.My mom called this afternoon. I don't know why. I can't remember anything urgent that needed telling, other than she had been out in the yard weed-eating this morning, cutting the heads off those weeds that sprout up. But she said she was disappointed that I had not called her after The Pony's dentist appointment to ask if she wanted to ride over to Culver's for some frozen custard. Can you believe the nerve of her? After not bringing me any free expired frozen custard only Monday! I guess I showed HER!\"We went to get haircuts after the dentist. You'll never guess who cut my hair. I'll give you 2001 guesses, though. We have plenty of time.\"\"Oh. I don't think I can guess.\"\"That's the easy way out. Give it a try. You have a lot of guesses.\" \"Do we know each other?\"\"No.\"\"Well, I don't know how I can guess if I don't even know who it is!\"\"If you knew who it was, you wouldn't have to guess!\" Mom seems to find my interrogation techniques hilarious. She was already gasping for breath. \"That's why I'm giving you so many chances. But all I can answer is YES or NO. You have 2000 guesses left.\"\"Is it a former student from your school?\"\"No. But that is very close.\"\"Does this person have red hair?\"\"No. That is not a very good guess. I gave you a major hint. What's next, 'Does this person have false teeth?' Try to use the hints!\"\"Oh, you've got me tickled. I can't breathe. I was going to change clothes and run to town before it rains, but now I don't know if I have the strength.\"\"You shouldn't have been out in the yard weed-eating, using all your energy! Think of this game as me giving you exercise. Guess again.\"\"Is this person blond?\"\"No.\"\"Brunette?\"\"YES! I'm sure you'll guess it now that you've narrowed it down like that!\"\"Oh, stop! Does this person go to my church?\"\"No.\"\"Did this person talk about me?\"\"No. This person doesn't know you, remember? You're not very good at this game. Hey! Pony! What's that game Genius had that was a little disc that answered whatever you were thinking about in twenty questions?\"\"You mean TWENTY QUESTIONS?\"\"Yeah. I guess that was it. Well, even that game would not be able to answer Grandma's guess in twenty questions. She's terrible at this! Okay, next question.\"\"Is it a male or a female?\"Um. That's not a yes or no question.\"\"Is it male?\"\"No.\"\"Is it female?\" \"Yes. That kind of wasted a question. But you have SO many more to go.You have not paid attention to your clues. What did I tell you in the beginning? That you were very close when you asked if it was a former student from my school.\"\"Was it a teacher from your school?\"\"No. They already have jobs.\"\"Are they under 30?\"\"Yes. I think so.\" \"Was it Mabel?\"\"No. She is retired. Not under 30.\"\"Was it your secretary from school?\"\"No. We already established no red hair. And she's not under 30.\"\"Oh, I am exhausted. I'll never guess!\"\"Probably not. Next question? We've only been at this 15 minutes. We have a long way to go. Here's another hint. It has a connection to The Pony and his friends. The Pony is at the top of his class. What's next to the top of the class?\"\"The bottom?\"\"NO! The bottom of the class is not next to the top. The almost-top of the class is next to the top.\"\"Is it that math teacher's son?\"\"No. He's in a different class. He's older. But it has something to do with the math contest every year.\"\"Was it that math teacher?\"\"NO! Teachers already have jobs. They are not cutting hair the week before school starts.\"\"Oh...I give up.\"\"You just expect me to TELL you? After I've given you all of those hints?\"\"Yes. I have to go to town.\"\"All right. You know that kid who sometimes beats The Pony in math competition, the one he raced to get the medal one year because they tied again, and The Pony didn't want to wait 12 weeks for the duplicate medal to come in this time? It was that kid's sister.\"\"Oh.\"\"I can't believe you didn't guess it! We're going to have to practice until you get better at this game.\"Was that too rough on her? You know. For not bringing me that free expired frozen custard? I don't think it was. But I also don't think she will make the connection."}, {"title": "Facing the Cold Soft Truth", "date": "Tuesday, August 5, 2014", "text": "Sometimes, there are things you don't really want to hear. Like when my boys were in elementary school, and their third grade teacher chose to explain the ingredients in hot dogs. Genius has rarely eaten one since. The Pony got over it much quicker. He would stuff himself with hot dogs if it was socially acceptable.Then there was the elementary art teacher who told the second graders all about Santa Claus. Every year. Like they weren't hearing it enough from the older kids on the bus.Okay, I admit to giving out a little too much info one time. But it had to be done. This was ninth grade. A kid asked me what pickles looked like before they were picked. Um. She didn't want to know that pickles were cucumbers before they became pickles. Seems she really, really didn't like cucumbers. And vowed never to eat another pickle. So sorry. She should be glad that only nine other kids were in class to lecture her about pickles. Not the entire general population of high school students. I did her a favor, really. Saved her from future embarrassment.My own unwanted awakening came out of the mouth of my cousin. She was three years older than me. We were spending a few days at my grandma's house over the summer. Grandma used to take all of us grandkids for two weeks solid every summer. What she was thinking I can't imagine. Perhaps how GOOD it felt to thrash us all at croquet. Anyhoo...as a special treat, instead of sleeping in the back bedroom, or on the hide-a-bed, or on a pallet on the floor, Grandma sometimes allowed us to sleep in the camper. To the best I remember, it looked like this:That's a 1956 Southland Runabout, I think. And if I remember correctly, it had a bed in the back like this:But my rude awakening came in the kitchen. At the table that had been my bed the night before:Uh huh. My grandma's camper was nowhere near this grand. But I am happy to find a reasonable facsimile on the innernets.So...my cousins and I had been running around in the yard, perhaps throwing hedgeapples down the sinkhole by the driveway while adults were busy snapping beans or husking corn. Grandma never let anyone leave without a box of fresh produce. Any time our parents came to visit, they left well-stocked with garden goods. Fresh tomatoes warm from the vine were not what was dancing in our heads, though. We were waiting on the most important food preparation: ice cream.I couldn't find a picture that reminded me of our ice cream churn. I think it was blue, and had a silver piece in the middle, and an area to fill with ice and rock salt, and a crank on the side. The adults took turns cranking. And, by magic, ice cream was formed!There I sat, across the camper table/bed from my cousin, clicking my metal spoon against my olive green Melmac bowl, stirring my ice cream until I had it good and smooth, the way I liked it. My cousin asked what I was doing. She had already eaten her portion.\"I'm stirring it. I like it kind of melty.\"\"Yuck. Not me. Then it turns into what it was before it was ice cream.\"NOOOOO! I loved my ice cream melty. Smooth. Like cold cake batter. No lumps.Now that's what I think about every time I let my frozen treat get soft and smooth.STILL TASTES GREAT, THOUGH!"}, {"title": "Val's Worth Continues to Erode", "date": "Monday, August 4, 2014", "text": "Seems like only yesterday that Val was the Five-Dollar Daughter.Has she not faithfully driven her mother to doctor's appointments, cleaned and bandaged the incision on her face, advised her on how to interact with her handyman, Chatty Handy, and gotten her tickled against her wishes? Yes. The answer to all items in this question is YES!The last time Val and Mom took a road trip, to pay bills, pick up Rally's fast food for The Pony, and indulge in a frozen custard treat...Mom gave Val five dollars. Well. How the worm has turned!Today, Mom wanted to go out for lunch and treat The Pony, Val, Val's sister the ex-mayor's wife, Val's niece, and Val's niece's baby daughter. Let the record show that the baby doesn't eat much. Fighting a headache since last night, unable to dose it with anything other than acetaminophen due to her blood-thinner regime, Val declined, but drove The Pony to Mom's house for the affair.Mom and The Pony met up with the other three gals at Culver's in a nearby town. The Pony had never strapped on the feedbag at Culver's, and later gave a mixed review. Seems he couldn't taste the ketchup and mustard on his burger, and found his chocolate shake to be too thick. As if that's possible. Mom would accept no money, saying The Pony's meal was her treat. Let the record show that Mom had originally been willing to foot the bill for Val's lunch as well.Oh, the things one finds out when one has a little Pony. Seems that Culver's was giving away frozen custard today. GIVING IT AWAY!Mom: \"I'm sorry The Pony didn't enjoy his food. Maybe next time. I ordered my vanilla cone first, and ate it before my meal. The others ate their regular food first.\"Val: \"That's why The Pony didn't like his shake. He was full of real food. Culver's has the best custard ever. I told him that the other day.\"Pony: \"They were giving some away.\" Mom: \"Uh huh. I was not embarrassed to sit there with my cone. They were giving away, what was it, Pony? Containers of custard. Was it pints?\" Pony: \"Grandma didn't get any for you.\"Mom: \"Well, it was strawberry. I didn't think you liked strawberry. I thought you just liked chocolate.\" See what happens when Mom assumes? She makes a bitter custard-joneser out of Val.Val: \"I like strawberry. I would have LOVED to have some custard.\"Mom: \"Your sister said, 'It has REAL strawberries in it!' They were just giving it away. Isn't that right, Pony?\"Pony: \"Yes. But it expired today.\"Val: \"LIKE THAT MEANS ANYTHING! Grandma gives me expired stuff all the time!\"Mom: \"They said it was still good for 45 days.\"Val: \"Yet you didn't get any for me.\"Mom: \"Well, I didn't think you liked strawberry.\"Val: \"I would have liked VANILLA if it was frozen custard from Culver's, being given away for free!\"Mom: \"I'll know that next time.\"Uh huh.

But it's not. Don't bother checking. August 10 is the next lunar bloating. You'd never have guessed that if you experienced the morning I had. My weirdo magnet was obviously operating on a full charge. Let me share my angst with you. I'm a giver like that. I will present three vignettes in reverse chronological order, by descending comfort level.The Yardy Pooper.I parked T-Hoe down at the end of The Voice of the Village to get a 44 oz. beverage. First I busied myself with recording my Walmart purchase in my check register. We'll get to the reason for that momentarily. Remember, these tales are in reverse chronological order, like that Seinfeld episode everybody hates where the gang ends up at a wedding in India, but actually starts out there.A lady walked past T-Hoe from the gas pumps, across the parking lot, up over the sidewalk, onto a grassy area about the size of half a basketball court. She had a sweet little Sheltie on a leash. She proceeded to let her Sheltie do her business on that grass. Not out at the end by the sidewalk where there's extra parking, but up against the building. Where the staff squats to smoke in the shade during break time.Seriously! Why do people assume any grassy area is a dog toilet? This swatch of lawn is more suited to let toddlers run off some energy during long highway trips. Not for dogs to leave their excrement. That lady could just have easily, MORE easily, in fact, led her little dog to the state-maintained right-of-way between the pumps and the road. The area where I saw a big fat rat dashing across the street. There's a ditch by it. The doggie doodoo could wash down in there if we ever have some rain.The Sideswiper.On our way to The Voice of the Village, right beside the concrete plant that makes giant thick beams which hold up bridge decks, I heard a siren approaching from behind. I pulled over to the right and stopped. Much like one would do for a funeral, you know. Except this area has no shoulders. The road goes right up against the sidewalk, then a fence. In my rearview mirror, and my driver's side mirror, I saw a black truck bearing down on me at a rapid rate. Blue lights flashed on the dash. That means volunteer fireman around these parts. Not red for police or ambulance or the actual fire rescue squad. This guy was headed for the firehouse.I understand that speed is of the essence. I also understand that if there is no traffic in the oncoming lane, with a clear view for a quarter of a mile, and with an empty parking lot on the other side of that oncoming lane...there is no need for a vehicle to come within inches of my T-Hoe while passing me. The whole oncoming lane was available. No need to nearly strip me of my one good door-mirror just to show off. He did the same thing to the car in front of me. Came near to scraping it. All for naught. Surely it would have been faster to race up the other lane, much like passing a car on a divided highway, rather than carefully control the trajectory to skim past cars that were stationary, allowing quick passage.Unfortunately, I am familiar with those who like to play fireman, and understand the self-importance and the shoulder-chip that goes along with carrying that radio. Like a physician's creed should be first, do no harm...a fireman's creed should be first, do not cause an accident going to an accident.The 'Christopher-Walken-Crazy' Man.My nerves were still on high alert when the volunteer fireman swooped in for a near-kill. I had just pulled onto the road after cutting through by the dead-mouse-smelling post office, having gone past the lake, headed home from the weekly Walmart trip. Walmart is not a safe haven for man nor beast nor Val nor Pony these days.We came out through the exit door, you know, the one most people walk into and shoulder you out of the way, pushing our cart full of purchases. I handed The Pony the keys so he could push the clicker and open the back hatch while I wheeled the cart up to it. We were fortunate this morning, my friends, to find a spot a mere three spaces up the row. There was handicapped, a red van, and us. But when we came out, a silver sedan had taken the van's place. More on that later.A white Yukon had let us across the people-walk with our cart. As we rolled up to T-Hoe's rear, that Yukon followed. It stopped. And stayed. Obviously waiting for our spot. It was, after all, the first weekend of the month. Busy time for Walmart, parking places at a premium. Obviously, White Yukon had never seen The Pony unload a cart before. I hope the power windows worked, for the driver to unfurl the long white beard she would grow while waiting for the spot.The Pony took the cart to the rack, and I got in. Normally, I fish the receipt out of my pocket, put my debit card back in the checkbook, write the amount of purchase in the checkbook register, and douse The Pony and my own hands with Germ-X. Then we are ready to start up T-Hoe and hit the road. Today, however, I had White Yukon waiting. I turned on the ignition. Looked over my shoulder. And saw a couple of people walking past. T-Hoe's beeper went off. I waited until they were clear.Then another guy crossed the people-walk and strode alongside White Yukon. He glared! At White Yukon! He was not a Ward-Cleaver-looking guy. He was creepy. Dark hair, combed back, a little below earlobe length, probably late 40s, wearing a black leather jacket. Let the record show that the temperature was 85 degrees. I waited for him to cross behind me, but he came in between. He fiddled around with the door of the silver sedan.Let's remember that T-Hoe was running. I was getting a crick in my neck looking over my shoulder. I said to The Pony, \"Well, if this doofus ever gets out of the way, we'll go.\" I do not like to back my large SUV out of a parking space with a person standing between me and the next car. Even though I had already folded in my passenger-side non-mirror when I parked, to allow people easier access to walk between cars. Because, I think we've established, I'm a giver. As I looked over my shoulder, waiting to make my escape, Crazy Man looked in. Also let the record show that there is no way he could have heard me call him a doofus. This was not a case where The Pony says to me later, \"Um. You know your windows were down, right?\" Uh uh. They were up, sealed tighter than a drum, with the air conditioner blasting, and T-Hoe and White Yukon both idling.Crazy Man opened the door of his silver sedan. He put his Walmart bag in. Sat down behind the wheel. Closed the door. THEN GOT OUT! HE TAPPED ON T-HOE'S BACK PASSENGER WINDOW! Yeah, um...NO! No way was I rolling down that window! The Pony and I both refused to look at him. I faced the front. I saw The Pony tuck his chin down to look at his laptop. We waited. Finally, Crazy Man opened up his silver sedan door again, and got in.He might have been an esteemed church deacon running into Walmart to buy PoliGrip for old widow-women parishioners. But to me, he looked like a psycho perv bent on revenge because I had the nerve not to squish him between our autos. Oh. And because I dared to utter a private comment inside the confines of my private vehicle that there is no way he could have heard, and could have only lip-read if he had superhuman vision through my tinted windows. Maybe he was mad because White Yukon was behind his car, blocking him from backing out. Any fool could clearly see that I had that White Yukon waiting for my spot, with my car running, and I was just waiting for a clear path to back up.WTF? I have no clue what his intentions were.Val refuses to be on the local evening news as another parking lot statistic."}, {"title": "Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid", "date": "Saturday, August 2, 2014", "text": "Sometimes I have current happenings to write about, sometimes I have follow-up stories, sometimes I beat a dead horse for nigh unto a week. But today, I have a companion piece. I think you'll be able to match it up by the time you get to the end.Years ago, soon after we moved into our new school building, my best ol' ex-teaching buddy Mabel and I met up after classes every day for a workout. This was back in the day, when students were not appropriated to hang around after school for various programs funded by grant money. When the only people who stayed after were athletes practicing in the gym, and teachers working in their rooms. You could look down our long, long hallway and perhaps imagine a tumbleweed bouncing across the vast emptiness. A pin dropped at Mabel's end could be heard an eighth of a mile away at my end. We pretty much had the place to ourselves.It was our habit to walk the hallowed halls, catching up on daily gossip while exercising our legs and lungs. Because we were so involved in current events, we had to tally our trips with post-it notes made by Mabel. Each trip down and back, she would move a post-it so we knew when our regimen was fini. It was a peaceful time, the only obstacle to our exercise being the occasional blockade caused by faculty standing smack-dab in the middle of the hall for a vital conversation. Yeah. You'd think they could have found a better place to rendezvous than the middle of our workout path.I think, way back then, Mabel had 7th hour plan time, but I'm not sure. For whatever reason, she was already dressed and rarin' to go by the time the bell rang. So I would hurry and change my socks and shoes as soon as kids were out of the hall. I kept my stuff in my wooden cabinet by the door. All I had to do was get them out, prop my foot up on the chair of the desk right across from the cabinet, and switch into white socks and New Balance. Mabel arrived as I was tying the laces, and our odyssey began.My boys rode the bus from their buildings over to mine. They finished homework, had snacks stored in the bottom drawer of my file cabinet, and watched videos. Every now and then a power struggle erupted, and one or the other would seek me out for justice. Genius would merely step outside the door and wait until we passed by. The Pony trotted down the hall to meet me, his persecution much more urgent, and in need of immediate intervention.Once our mileage was completed, Mabel gathered her post-its for another day, and I stuffed my school shoes and socks into a Walmart bag and gathered up my progeny for the ride home. It was the perfect workout system. Cool in the heat of Indian Summer, warm in the throes of winter.Back in those days, I was in charge of the at-risk program. I worked with students who did not qualify for special programs, but were falling through the cracks. Our goal was to keep them from dropping out, and to help them stay on track to earn their credits and graduate on time. I mainly had freshmen and sophomores, no more than 10-12 students per class. I relate well to that type of student, and these were some of the most rewarding times of my teaching career. As you might imagine, the dynamics in such a classroom are a bit different than those in a regular core class course. My students often spoke without thinking, made mountains out of molehills, or tried to smooth mountains into molehills, depending on their personal agenda.One morning, a fairly quiet student had a meltdown. She came in late for 1st hour, asked to go see a teacher about a missing assignment, and flounced out with an air of shoulder-chip-ness. As soon as she left, one boy turned to me and the others, mostly guys, and said, \"Did you see her HEAD? I thought she had a THIRD EYE!\" He was not so much poking fun as showing his awe at her unsightly facial blemish. Another chimed in, \"I think that thing had a HEARTBEAT!\" We heard something in the hall. They gasped and faced the front. Another dude said, \"Shh!

Just this morning, he called to tell me that he finally found a mirror to replace the one he broke while backing T-Hoe out of the garage on the first day of my unfortunate hospitalization in May. Uh huh. Three months of driving without a passenger-side mirror is enough! Never mind that instead of the $350 that Hick initially said it would cost, he has found one for $82. No, he didn't find it at the auction. I think he called it \"down market\" or \"back market,\" but definitely not \"black market.\" That means it's not exactly manufactured and sold as a Chevrolet part. I can't wait to see what it looks like. I'll probably be the only Backroadsian driving a black Tahoe with a cherry-red fold-in passenger-side mirror.But we're not here today to sing the praises of my sweaving, scavenging, mirror-breaking better half. Nope. We're here to discuss his questionable fashion sense. Whoa! I'm not shaming Hick because he's not GQ material. He can hop into his overalls (though I DO prefer that he not wear them backwards like that one morning when he couldn't figure out why it was so hard to fasten those shoulder straps) and lace up his Jed Clampett boots as long as he leaves his straw hat with the green visor brim behind. My issue is with him dressing a bit younger than his age.Tuesday, Hick swove drove me to the hospital for some outpatient surgery. I did not fixate on his attire. After all, I was undergoing the knife, and in no mood for nitpicking. Besides, I had to get up at 3:00 a.m. in order for us to leave by 4:00, so Hick could have been wearing a black Hefty trash bag and silver duct tape prom dress for all I noticed.Once I was checked in, waiting for the doomcryer to announce my name to go back for surgery, the full effect of Hick's ensemble hit me.Have you seen those Kia car commercials with the fat hamsters? That was my first thought. Hick had dressed himself in a pair of baggy cargo shorts, the color best described as canvas watermelon dusty rose. For a shirt, he had chosen a polo with the hue several shades off from the shorts, more like an overly-ripe tomato red. In his mind, and his one good eye, I think the colors matched. His feet were shod with black New Balance running shoes, showing just a bit of white ankle-sock.He caught me looking at him. I didn't want to disparage my driver to his face. Not before he got me home, all groggy, able to fend for myself.\"What?\"\"Oh. Nothing. You just have some crumbs there on your shirt, by the pocket. You must have spilled some of those Ritz Bits crackers that you tilted your head back to swallow while you were driving.\"\"That? Oh, that's just dry skin. From my beard.\" Hick brushed off the flakes, then gave his goatee a scruffing, resulting in more flakes, which he again brushed off his chest.Sometimes, the idea of surgery is not the true horror that consumes one's waiting-room thoughts."}, {"title": "There Is the Edge of Well-Roundedness, and Then There Is the Circumference", "date": "Thursday, July 31, 2014", "text": "A few posts back, I made an announcement which revealed that Backroads is being dragged from the Dark Ages and into modern times, what with the grand opening of its first gay bar, which featured a show with four drag queens.

A celebrity from the city. Perhaps you've seen her, hanging out on street corners in a T-shirt emblazoned with: Will Write For Food. Or maybe it specified: Will Write For Bolthouse Farms Vanilla Chai Tea and Any Form of Chocolate. Yes. Sometimes I call her Sioux, and sometimes I call her Madam. In any case, I was tapping my foot with excitement, counting down the seconds until she arrived.I swear, it was like that time Jerry Seinfeld met Keith Hernandez! Not the part where Keith asked Jerry to help him move. The part where Elaine accused Jerry of acting like it was a date. Yes. I couldn't wait until time for Sioux to arrive so I could talk about myself!Let me tell you a little something about Sioux. She is a real scofflaw. First thing she did was park her tiny little city car right beside a sign that said, \"This lot is for customer parking only. Others will be towed.\" And that, my reading and writing friends, it a bit of foreshadowing. Not the towing part, but the law-scoffing part.Sioux shamed me by wearing her Crocs. I know I should have been expecting that. But I, alas, did not wear my beautiful red version. I wanted to be sure-footed while piloting T-Hoe all around the towns. Sioux hopped in T-Hoe's shotgun seat bearing her likeness on a stick. Not just any likeness. Nothing handcrafted from student supplies while allegedly working off snow day hours. Nope. Sioux had an 8 1/2 by 11 glossy of her happy face, a photo fit for a queen, attached to a sturdy paint stirring stick. And all I had was my little ol' Val-in-a-Recliner. Country mouse, meet city mouse. I must say, being propped against Sioux's stick persona made this full-figured gal feel quite petite!First cat out of the bag, I took Sioux on a tour of the old homestead. Out past the prison and through the woods, to Thevictorian house we went. On the gravel road, I tried my best to slow down. I gave Sioux a warning that if she had a spinal fusion, and this trip resulted in paralysis, that I would make sure to drag her body onto our land so her injury would be covered by our umbrella policy.I couldn't believe that my sweet, sweet Juno did not bound out to greet Sioux like she does every other intruder, the UPS driver, and strange men who walk around the porch like they belong there. Nope. Juno cowered and whimpered like somebody stole her last egg. I don't know what was wrong with her. Perhaps she was embarrassed by her own unkempt appearance. Ann played nice, but we all know that dog has nothing in her noggin, not even a hamster on a wheel.Sioux was kind enough to send me a couple of pictures. I did not even try to get some with my cell phone. I'm a terrible photographer. Sioux, on the other hand, had this magical device like a computer monitor screen. I think I've heard people call those things iSomethings, or notebooks, or tablets, or surfaces. Or maybe it was just a big flat camera. Anyhoo...she captured us in front of Gassy-G, the bargain auction grill with a hankerin' for Auction Meat.Sioux might have been experiencing a reaction to the dust on Gassy-G. I, however, was comfy in my recliner, having immunities to all particulate matter that flies around Backroads.We stopped by the creek and EmBee, the mailbox, for more photo opps. I'd never seen so many cars and trucks come out our gravel road. They all stared at me like I was some city intruder enjoying their wilderness. People can be so rude!From there, we headed to Voice of the Village. Sioux wanted a shot of the famous Diet Coke dispenser in this store where my magical elixir costs 80 cents or nothing, depending on who's working. People at the coolers near the juice had the nerve to turn and look at us. Took a step in our direction. I guess everyone in Backroads thinks they're invited to the party.We took off for my mom's house to drop off The Pony. Sioux hopped out to get a photo of Stick-Sioux and Val-in-a-Recliner near the driveway. Mom ran out and asked what was going on. She thought Sioux was sticking a For Sale sign in the yard. Which kind of speaks to the size of Stick-Sioux. Mom being Mom, she forgot the elaborate scenario we had worked up, in which she would grab her quart of slaw and two spoons, and meet us in the yard. As punishment, I made her show Sioux her recent facial incision. AND SHE DID! No twirling that hair in front of it. I guess Sioux seems like someone who would want to see incisions on the mend.Off to see my school building, though I was not about to venture inside for a third day in a row. No. The halls were being prepped for waxing, and I did not want to lose my head. Or have it get stuck under a faucet in the faculty restroom sink. Not that Sioux would have shoved it there, of course. I though Sioux would simply look at my room from the parking lot. But no! She jumped out with her picture-taker and charged the building. So bold, that Sioux! I jumped out so the inside powers could see me on surveillance, and not call the police on Sioux. Perhaps she mentioned in her account how a police car followed us around Backroads.By now it was time to have Sioux back to her car before she turned into a pumpkin, or before her car was towed for not being a customer. But first we had one last stop. The gas station chicken store! And in honor of the upcoming birthdays of Sioux and Val, a tall cake sat in the grass, with a birthday wish upon it: Happy 150th! Yes. We look young for our age. A picture of that cake was not good enough for Sioux. She insisted on a picture from INSIDE THE GAS STATION CHICKEN STORE!That Sioux has balls of steel. I presume. I did not check out her ball-attachment anatomy. That kind of thing is frowned upon, even here in Backroads. But what happened next was my clue. Sioux said I could sit in the getaway car T-Hoe if I was embarrassed, and she would go in and take a picture. Oh, dear. I know those workers in that cramped gas station chicken store. They can smell a stranger a mile away. And nobody could be stranger than Sioux with her iSomething, propping a giant head on a paint stick and a shrunken head in a recliner up against the soda spigots. It wasn't long before Sioux scurried across the parking lot. I may or may not have been in motion already, causing her to dive through the door like a hobo hopping a train.\"What's the matter? Did they give you the bum's rush? Grab you by collar and belt, and fling you out?\"\"No. But as I was setting up the sticks, a lady said, 'CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?' And I said, 'No. I'm just taking a picture.'\"Balls. Of. Steel.I ferried Sioux over to her tiny little city car, which was miraculously untowed, and she gave me some fudge for not abandoning her on a canoe trip down the big river for toothless men who like purty mouths to find. I must admit I felt a bit guilty. I think I had lured Sioux here under false pretenses, having promised her lunch, then not giving her so much as a gas station chicken leg. Que sera, sera. At least I already had the fudge in my hot little hands.It was a wonderful day.

I've been working on a project. Not so much a project as a method of frittering away the time I served in my classroom to make up some snow days. Here are the results:Yep! That's Val-in-a-Recliner. First of all, let's show the elephant in the room the door. I got this idea from Cathy C. Hall, and her Cathy-on-a-Stick. I'm not really stealing. I'm FLATTERING! Because, you see, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. And Val is nothing if not a flatterer. So, thank you, Cathy C. Hall, for not pressing charges.The reason for the birth of Val-in-a-Recliner was a visit from blog buddy Sioux. I knew we needed something special to commemorate our crime spree. And with no color printer hooked up thanks to Genius, I had only a black-and-white head shot to work with. That would not do. Nobody puts Val in a monochrome. And what better background for Val's head shot than a recliner? So...with scant hours remaining before Sioux's impending rendezvous, I printed black-and-white photos of a recliner and my own head. THEN I colorized them with colored pencils from my classroom cabinet, glued them together with glue sticks that were NOT LOCKED UP (that's for you, Mabel), and taped them to two bendy straws left over from our tower-building competition in May. Perhaps you don't grasp the full effect of Val's artistic ability in that photo. Here's a close-up:Note the finer details in the shading of the threadbare recliner. And Val's ruddy cheeks! Yes. I truly outdid myself on this one. In fact, the consensus is that Val-in-a-Recliner looks more like Val than her state-issued driver's license photo. Here now! No comments on how my eyebrows look like the ones Elaine drew on Uncle Leo with Magic Marker! And nary a word about how I look suspiciously like that picture of George's boss, Mr. Kruger, who George tried to draw in after he got airbrushed out of the beach photo that had George in the background. That's what happens when you're gluin' it old-style. No Photoshop on Val's New Delly. Val is an improvisor, flying by the seat of her comfortable pants.I would like to get on with a rebuttal (heh, heh, I said reBUTTal) of Sioux's version of the visit, but time and space do not allow that today.

Or, rather, it came upon us, head on, from the opposite direction. I saw the line of cars stopped ahead of me, and the oncoming train of cars with lights on, preceded by the hearse. I did what any civilized driver would do, and pulled as far as I could to the right, then waited until the funeral party passed. Between me and the other cars in my lane was the parking lot entrance to a pawn shop. So I did not block it, but left that gap.Just after the hearse and two lead cars passed me, with a full line of mourners still to come, I spied a car fast approaching in my rearview mirror. \"I hope that car doesn't ram us. It's coming pretty fast. I know it can see that I'm parked, and those cars ahead of us are parked. What's the deal? STOP ALREADY!\"That car kept a-comin'. If I had put T-Hoe's PRNDL in R, I would have heard my back-up beeper go off. That's how close Speedy came to ramming me. Speedy sat for about three seconds, half behind me and half in the center turn lane.THEN SPEEDY PULLED AROUND ME AND PASSED! WITH THE FUNERAL PROCESSION IN FULL SWING!I shook my fist and yelled, \"You speed-demon! Show respect!\" It was not as good as my \"You kids get off my lawn\" speech. But I WAS strapped in behind the wheel, and didn't have full use of my shaking fist. \"You know to pull off when a funeral is coming, don't you, Pony?\"\"Uh huh. It's a sign of respect.\"So after blowing by me, Speedy rushed up on the waiting line of cars and slammed on the brakes. The funeral passed, and we came upon the butt-end of Speedy at a red light. I shook my fist some more, for good measure, and my head as well, in an effort to shame some sense into Speedy. At the next red light, we were making a right, and passed by Speedy in traffic.\"Huh. It's not like Speedy is a kid who doesn't know better. She's all bleachy blonde with skin like leather. No spring chicken. And look! She has handicap plates! Must be MENTALLY handicapped.\" (Let the record show that Val does not mean this as an indictment of all differently-mentally-abled folk.)\"Hey! She had a hospital bracelet on her wrist!\"\"Well, maybe she's an ESCAPED mental patient. Which would explain the big hurry.\"I swear. It's the downfall of society.

We only chatted a few minutes, because, as she was the first to say, she didn't know anything. We commiserated on how we could manage the Cardinals better than their current manager, and how he better not mess things up in today's game like he did on Friday.

There were some good stories last week.\"\"Oh. I know you said that, but I didn't read it. That's okay. I'm on my way to church. I have to go to the bank first thing tomorrow morning and get checks without your name on them. I can't use my other checks. Friday was the last day.\"\"I know how much you distrust me, and won't write a check with my name on it. I assure you, your money is safe with me.\" I was just needling her a bit. Her bank was bought out, and they sent her new checks, but they included my name and my sister the ex-mayor's wife's name on the checks because we are on Mom's account. Little things like this really bother Mom. Can you imagine? You'd think the custodian had been moving her classroom furniture around or something.\"I was just telling you that in case you try to call me tomorrow morning and I'm not home. I might go to Aldi's after church, because the regular preacher is still gone on vacation, and we might get out early. But I might come straight home to watch the game.

I don't think anybody is going to steal your cash out of the collection plate.\"\"No, I'm not worried about them taking it. But I want a record that I donated.\"\"So let me get this straight. You won't leave cash, because you wouldn't get credit for donating. So to avoid that, you are simply not going to donate?\"\"Yes.\"\"That seems kind of...I don't know...odd. That you want to make sure people know you donated, that this fact is really important to you, yet you are purposefully not donating. So not only will you not get credit, but you are not actually donating. I don't understand that reasoning.\"\"Well, that's just how I am.\"\"Okay. You'd better get going.

Even in Backroads.Imagine my surprise when I clicked on my hometown online newspaper Friday morning, and saw that Backroads is getting its first gay bar. Not that there's anything wrong with that.Okay, the first thing I thought was, \"Why does this paper sell so many ads that it takes a coon's age to load a page? Why must this paper make it so hard for people who don't pay an arm and a leg for a print subscription to read their paper?\" But I think that every day when I read the paper. For free. From the comfort of my laptop, without waiting all day and watching out the window for it to be deposited in a special box beside the mailbox, because nobody can mess with federal property used by the U.S Postal Service.The next thing I did was read about school drug testing. And then about a dude who left his naked toddler wandering on the state lettered highway, then refused to pick him up from the police station because, \"I have warrants.\" And then about a scam warning because of people calling and saying they're a relative in a foreign country and need money to get home. But right after that, I clicked on the new gay bar.Seems like it opened last weekend, with a big shindig that included four drag queens from the city, and over a hundred customers who had a great time. It's not in Backroads proper, but near a lake development. The guy who runs it says he's going to add a restaurant on the side. He thinks there's enough clientele to keep him afloat, and he says that anybody is welcome, not just gays. I think with his location, he might pull in a bunch of the lake crowd. Think about it. They can drive their golf carts and four-wheelers across the road, and not have to go anywhere for a night out and risk a DWI. Not that driving a golf cart under the influence is good. But you know what I'm getting at. If that location is not exactly where I think it is, he may go under. Nobody wants to drive to the middle of nowhere to have a few brews. Apparently they're only having one drag queen this weekend, with a cover charge of five dollars. Seriously. You can't even go to the movies for that.I told my mom about it on our bill-paying trip. Her paper doesn't get there until the afternoon. Sucks to pay an arm and a leg and have to wait for your paper. Anyhoo...I told her I didn't see people across the county beating a path to its door just for that kind of show. And do you know what she said?\"Oh. You don't think Hick would go to check it out?\"\"Um. No.\"\"Just to see what it's like?\"\"No. Let's remember his buddy will not even wear a purple shirt because purple is a girl's color. I don't see Hick going to a gay bar to watch a drag show.\"Apparently my mom does not know Hick as well as she thinks she does.

A situation which I am reluctant to discuss. Something to be swept under the rug. Locked in the attic. Shoved between the mattress and box springs. But you know Val! She of the loose lips, who could have single-handedly sunk the Titanic with nary an iceberg in sight, just a couple of flippant comments to the wrong parties, and BINGO, the Titanic takes a nosedive into Davy Jones's locker. And I'm not talking about The Monkee who Marcia Brady got to sing at her dance.Here's the deal. There's a dirty little secret in Backroads, and that dirty little secret is my sweet, sweet Juno. She has grown unkempt. She's the Pigpen of the Thevictorian fleabags. Where she used to be silky and shiny, she is now dull and matted. Full of burs. She has truly let herself go. If she was a person, she would be that gal you try to help by leaving Secret in her locker, dropping a sample bottle of Scope in her purse, or telling about this fabulous new shampoo you have just tried, called Prell. You don't want to hurt her feelings, but an intervention must be held.The Pony and I have both tried brushing Juno with the metal-pronged dog brush. She stands mostly still for me, but sits down for The Pony so he can't get to her feathery haunches. Her tail, which used to brush back-and-forth like a silky black broom, is now coated with dust, and tangled. The Pony and I have picked burs until the cows come home. But the next morning, Juno is full of them again.I told Hick that I want to shave Juno, or trim her to a very short length for the summer. He said I can't do that. That Juno's fur is how she keeps herself cool. Today I asked him again. Like maybe we can take her to a groomer at the start of next summer, and get her a haircut. Until then, my idea is a good No-More-Tears kind of dog shampoo. I fear that Hick is correct when he says she will simply run through the burs again tomorrow. And the day after. And the day after. Indeed, that seems to be the pattern.Either Ann the black german shepherd is lazier than Juno, or she has fur that repels the burs. Her only issue is that tan undercoat that gets full of dust, but it is easily brushed out with the dog comb. Funny thing. Lately Ann has been sleek and silky and shiny, while Juno is drab and dull. I think perhaps somebody else is eating Juno's daily egg ration.Anyhoo...Wednesday evening, I sent The Pony in to get my kitchen shears. I stood on the sidewalk and petted Juno up on the side porch. When the scissors arrived, I hacked many, many wads of bur-matted fur off of various locations on her body. Quite a lot, really. She was mainly compliant, though I did have to say \"bad dog\" a couple of times when she tried to run off to her house.While I was snipping snarls of fur-burs, The Pony took it upon himself to clean out the dog brush for the umpteenth time. The easiest way, you know, is to whack it on the side of the porch, or some other sturdy object. The Pony discovered this on his own and showed me, because I used to pull out those tufts of fur with my hands, much like you would clean a human hair brush. So there I am, snipping away, and The Pony, standing up on the side porch, starts whacking that dog brush on the shelf that holds the roaster pan full of cat kibble. Which meant that all of the fur wads he knocked loose were blown by the wind right into my face. I brought that news to his attention.\"Hey! The wind is blowing that dog fur right into my face!\"\"I know.\"Well. I'd had enough! I gave my kitchen scissors to The Pony and told him to take them inside. At least that got rid of him while I gave Juno a reward for being mostly a good sport while I hacked at her fur-burs. Oh, don't think I was rough on Juno. According to Hick, he and his Number One son took a break from putting up the sides of a hay shed to remove burs from Juno. WITH A POCKET KNIFE!\"Yeah, we tried to get some off of her. He had a pocket knife, so one of us would hold her while the other sawed until the fur came off.\"That man is just barbaric.So...Thursday morning I was rushing around getting ready to go serve my second day of snow-make-up hours at school, and I went to microwave the two mini sausage biscuits that I have with my medicine. I took the kitchen scissors out of the silverware drawer and snipped the corner off the package. The I snipped down the length of the package to vent it while they warmed.At that moment I remembered that the last time I used those kitchen scissors was for CUTTING FUR-BURS OFF MY SWEET, SWEET JUNO!\"ACK! I've cut open my food with dog scissors! I have dog germs! Get hot water! Get some disinfectant! Get some iodine!\" Lucy Van Pelt has nothing on Val.\"Hey! Pony! Did you put my kitchen scissors right back in the drawer after I used them to cut Juno's fur?\"\"Uh huh.\"\"They needed to be washed! Why didn't you put them by the sink?\"\"You didn't tell me to. So I put them back.\"My mom loved that story. She almost needed an inhaler to catch her breath. I don't find it quite so funny. And my tail is nowhere near wagging."}, {"title": "More From the Files of Unqualified People Shipping", "date": "Thursday, July 24, 2014", "text": "For a few years we've had a peace. A calm between storms. A ceasefire with Unqualified People Shipping. Oh, sure, we still have our Hatfield and McCoy feud with FedEx. But the biscuit-tossing dog lady had spoiled us with her prompt and polite UPS deliveries. Until yesterday.I was expecting a package from Amazon. Two-day shipping is free with Prime, you know. It's supposed to arrive by 8:00 p.m. on the second day. I had received emails saying my package had shipped, and would be here on Wednesday.When The Pony and I came home from school, we found a post office orange card in EmBee. We thought Genius might have ordered something. Because my email said my package with two items was arriving by UPS. It was a phone cover dealybobber for Hick, and a book for me. When we got to the house, there was no package. No big deal. They usually come around 4:00-6:00, and it was only 2:30. Still plenty of time.At 5:30, I got an email that said my package could not be delivered, and I should call for alternate instructions. I called the number given, which was automated, and a recording told me that the package was undeliverable because nobody was home, and it had been handed over to the post office for delivery. When I checked tracking, I saw that the USPS was the plan for delivery all along. UPS contracts some jobs out with them. Thus, the card. A bit of fudging on my undeliverable explanations there, but at least I was going to pick it up the next day.But wait! That was only the phone cover thingy.At 7:55, I got a call from the local UPS store. \"My driver could not find your address. Is it 1313 Mockingbird Lane?\"\"Yes. That's my address. Same as always for the past 17 years.\"\"Well, he found Mockingbird Lane, but he could not find your house. Which one is it?\"\"Um. The one with 1313 Mockingbird Lane on a sign three feet off the road.\" \"He's new. I'm going to give him a call, and if he's still in the neighborhood, he'll be by with your package in about five minutes.\"You know, I believed him. I hollered up to Hick, who even put a pair of shorts on over his post-swimming, after-shower tighty-whities. As you might have surmised by now, the package was not forthcoming. This morning I called the local UPS, whose number I got off my caller ID. The gal sounded a bit surprised that I was calling about an undelivered package, and that I had the tracking number.\"Let me go upstairs so I can look that up.\"\"I got a call last night that the driver could not find my house. That he found the street, but not my address. That is kind of funny, because my house is less that a half-mile up that street. There is only one other house before it, and I have my address hanging from a sign about three feet off the street, right by the driveway that leads to the house.\"\"Hm. Can you see the house?\"\"Yes. It's right down the driveway by the sign with the address hanging on it. First house on the right.\"\"Oh, yes it is. I will contact the driver. He's new.\"\"This package in only a book. Nobody has to be home. Just leave it on the porch. It will be fine.\"\"I'll make a note of that.\" \"Well, it's one thing if you can't find the street, but don't tell me you found the street and can't find my house, because that is impossible.\"\"I'll let him know.\"She must have been looking up Google Earth, because she acted like she could clearly see my house arrangement. SOMEBODY is trying to pull a fast one and make an excuse for not getting my package to me in two days. SOMEBODY must be really slow on his route, and thought people would fall for his pitiful excuse.BUT HERE'S THE BEST PART!When The Pony and I got home this afternoon, there was a package on our front porch. The Pony picked it up. He was chortling. \"Hey! Somebody drew a picture on our package!\"Yes. I think I got the last laugh. The dispatcher made my point, cartoony and clear. I almost forgive the Unqualified People Shipping for wasting my Amazon Prime money."}, {"title": "The Sign Said \"Professional Building,\" But Something Reminded Me of Brownsville Station", "date": "Wednesday, July 23, 2014", "text": "Monday I had a follow-up appointment with my pulmonary specialist. I really like him. He's outgoing and personable and seems like he knows what he's doing. The good news is that even though my Backroads hospital sent him a CAT scan of questionable quality, he saw no blood clots in my lungs. The bad news is that now he's changed his tune, and wants to keep me on this blood-thinner until May. I said I didn't want to be on it that long, and he said, \"Well, you want to live, don't you?\" I think he was being a bit overly dramatic, but he's the doctor. AND he said he's two years older than me, so he gets to boss me around.The most remarkable thing about that appointment was not what the doctor had to say, but the atmosphere in the waiting room. First of all, I could have climbed Mount Everest faster than the trip from the parking garage to the pulmonary suite. AND we were locked out when we finally arrived at the end of the Professional Building earth, with no chairs in sight, just a disjointed hallway. I take that back. A bunch of mismatched chairs WERE in sight, in the dark, through the glass of the waiting room. Inside we could see a light on the receptionist behind her window, so busy ignoring us. Finally a different lady came out and turned on the lights and unlocked the door. Let the record show that we arrived at 9:45. The first appointment was at 10:00. I was supposed to get there early to fill out paperwork.Anyhoo, I signed in and got my clipboard, and Hick and I sat on opposite sides of a corner from each other. Hick busied himself reading a flyer on how your body reacts once you quit smoking. It had a dramatic picture of a black lung. Other people trickled in, including a husband/wife combo who both had an appointment at the same time. I think they were the 10:00, because they were called back just before me, even though I arrived earlier.While we were waiting, the Combo got up and changed seats, sitting a mere chair away from Hick, and a bit across from me. Hick was playing with his new phone. I sent him a text. \"That guy stinks.\" Of course Hick didn't read it until later, after the HimCombo told the HerCombo he was going to the bathroom, and was gone ten minutes. Judging from his smell before he left, I think I know what he was doing. And it has nothing to do with a toilet. If people in real life had thought bubbles like people in cartoons, here's what was floating above the head of the HimCombo:How you doin' out there? Did y'ever seem to have one of those daysWhere it just seems like everybody's gettin' on your caseFrom your doctor all the way down to your best wifeWell, y'know, I used to have 'em just about all the timeBut I found a way to get out of 'em, let me tell you about itSittin' in the waiting room, thinkin' it's a dragListenin' to the receptionist rap just ain't my bagThe clock passed 10:30, you know that's my cueI'm gonna sneak a butt down the hall in the looSmokin' in the pulmonary specialist's men's roomSmokin' in the pulmonary specialist's men's roomNow, doctor, don't you fill me up with your rulesCause everybody knows that smokin' with bad lungs ain't coolMaybe it's just me, but I expect patients in a pulmonary specialist's waiting room to be smoke-free. Because if you have to see a lung doctor, that means your lungs are not up-to-snuff for smoking. Is that too much to ask? I also expect patients in a podiatrist's waiting room to have at least one foot, patients in an optometrist's waiting room to an eye, and patients in a gynecologist's waiting room to have hooters and a cooter. Oops! Sorry to be so crass as to use the typical Backroads medical terminology for those parts. Ahem. I meant patients in a gynecologist's waiting room should have breastesses and a 'gina.I really don't think that's too much to ask.

Today we take Val's mom to get eight stitches removed from her face. A simple feat, you might think. But you are forgetting that we're talking about Val and her mom, out on the town, together again.Mom hopped into T-Hoe with a bouffant to rival early Dolly Parton. \"I didn't put any medicine on my face today. I figured I could do that after I get home.\" I could not even see Mom's incision. She had that hair all teased up with a silver metal rattail comb so it made a protective layer over her cut like a cone of cotton candy.\"That's probably not good for it. Those hairs are getting stuck in the stitches.\"\"That's all right. Those stitches are coming out.\"In the waiting room, a pharmaceutical rep had the nerve to sit in the chair right next to Mom. Mom had already turned her body toward me, and the rep had turned away from Mom as well, to type into her drug-selling device. Mom fiddled with her hair on that side, twisting it and forming a barrier.\"I swear! Let it alone! What if you had this? THIS? This Frankenstein scar on your throat like me? That looks like my head is about to fall off. If you had that, you would part your hair in the middle, and tie both sides together down under your chin, like a beard.\"\"No I wouldn't. I would wear a scarf.\"\"It's ninety-five degrees out there! Deal with it like I do. A scar's a scar. It's part of you. People get used to it. Own your scar. If it was that big a deal, you should have asked for a plastic surgeon.\"\"Well, you have to understand, this is major surgery for me. It's the first time I ever had stitches. Except for the time I had that operation on my breast.\" She whispered that last word.\"Oh, and I suppose that didn't bother you at all. That you flaunted it. 'Look! Look! I have stitches! See my stitches?' Yeah. I'll bet you plopped it right out there for all to see.\"\"Yes I did.\" Mom sometimes gets a bit horsey when I take things too far.She was called in, and I followed. She said I could. But when I instructed her to say, \"Oh, you come in with me,\" when called, she refused. \"You can come in if you want. But I'm not going to say that.\" Hmpf! I guess I DID go too far.I had told Mom that the doctor would probably not take out the stitches himself. That he has people to do that for him. She said she would demand that he do it himself. That demand flew out the window when he popped his head in and told his nurse to do it for him. She was a tiny little thing with silky black hair (not unlike that of my sweet, sweet Juno--I wonder if this gal likes raw eggs) wearing fuschia sweatpants and a black knit shirt. So much for scrubs around the office.\"What ARE you?\" Mom asked. Perhaps a bit politically incorrectly. The little gal had an accent.\"What do you mean?\"\"Are you a student? A nurse? A nurse practitioner? Why do you do these things? Have you done them before or are you just learning?\"\"I'm a nurse. I've done it before. Yesterday I had the BEST-LOOKING man! I had to clean out his ear. Still. I can look, can't I? I'm married, but I can look.\"\"Oh, when my late husband was in the hospital for heart surgery, there was a doctor who came to talk to me that was so good-looking that I didn't hear a word he said.\"Fuschia told Mom to climb up on the table and lay on her side. She picked up the scissors the doctor had given her, and a pair of long tweezers. There was some debate about whether Mom had six stitches or eight. Mom proclaimed eight, but Fuschia said six. She was having a devil of a time getting ahold of those stitches.\"They are in so deep. Your skin has grown over them.\"\"What if you can't get them out?\"\"Oh, I'll get them out!\" Fuschia went off for better scissors, and returned with a pair that had curvy ends. \"This should do it.\" By the time she was done, eight stitches lay on the exam table beside Mom. \"I'm sorry, honey. I know that hurt. It's bleeding a little bit because they were grown in. Let me put some gauze over that for now.\"Mom was a bit nervous, being back on her blood-thinner. It didn't help when Fuschia wiped with the gauze, and Mom saw it come away red. Fuschia put some alcohol on more gauze, and laid it on the side of Mom's head.\"Just lay there for a minute. You think THIS is bad? Let me tell you about the time I had stitches. All of my male relatives are ministers or preachers. I decided that I wanted to be a preacher, too. So I climbed up on the dresser, and was giving a sermon. I was walking back and forth, preaching.\" Fuschia walked her fingers along the edge of the supply table, back and forth, prancing, stomping. \"I got to the end, and my foot slipped off the corner like THIS! And both feet flew off and I landed RIGHT ON THE CORNER! Do you know where I had to get stitches? RIGHT HERE!\" Fuschia pointed to the area where her right leg joined the rest of her body. \"Image a doctor taking stitches out, with his head right there! I was only twelve years old.\"After we left the office, Mom said, \"I really like her. She tells it like it is.\"\"No wonder. You two are just alike! You never know when to stop. Some things just don't need to be said.\"Of course I had to tell that story to The Pony on the way home.

Remember how I have been kind of recuperating all summer from my unfortunate three-day hospitalization, having knocked a bit too hard on death's door?And remember how I have not been able to sleep past 5:00 or 6:00 a.m., depending on Hick's whim of how much rest he thinks I've indulged in between my usual bedtime of 2:00 a.m. and his departure for work?Get this! Today, Sunday, Hick made sure I was up and moving by 7:30. Yes. I know that's a Rip-Van-Winkle age for my sleep habits. But still. It's SUNDAY! Just because Hick goes to bed with the chickens at the crack of dusk, and slurps up sleep like a five-year-old on a cherry sno-cone...that doesn't mean I am ready to get up when he does to admire whatever shack he's building, or watch him cart his auction bargains from Pacifica to Gator. Or, most often, to observe his tail lights as he drives to town for a clandestine breakfast under the guise of getting a four-hour haircut.Well! Take a whiff of THIS fine kettle of fish! Hick was in and out, puttering around doing a great big deal of nothing, calling The Pony to hold something while he screwed it (something metal or wood, I'm hoping), and waiting for Genius to return from an overnight swimming trip so they could chew the fat about his new phone. I went to town for some provisions for Genius to take back to his basement apartment and wrestle the landlords' Husky for, and some meat for Hick to grill for supper.No sooner had I returned and put away the groceries and plopped down in the La-Z-Boy to rest my weary knees than Hick crossed the threshold in a dramatic, wide-open kind of way that invites flies to partake of our hospitality. \"I feel sick to my stomach,\" pronounced Hick.\"Do we need to go to the ER? Are you having a heart attack?\"\"No. I feel sick to my stomach, I said.\"\"What did you eat?\"\"Just a breakfast platter from Burger King.\"Let the record show that Burger King is not in Backroads proper, but down the highway a piece in a neighboring town. Let the record further show that the time was shortly before noon.\"I'm going to lay down and see if I feel better.\"Let the record show in detail that Hick had already enjoyed a full nine hours of shut-eye before getting up at 7:30 a.m.With the assurance that the Grim Reaper was not Hick's little shadow, the thought dawned on me that I had been forcibly yanked from my slumber, while this snooze glutton was now having second helpings. Not on my watch. Val, like karma and Mother Nature, is a harsh taskmistress. I waited about ten minutes, time enough for Hick to make himself comfortable and nod off. Hm. I had not yet changed out of my town clothes. So I opened the bedroom door on the way to our bathroom to slip into my raggedy attire, and saw Hick, or at least a large lump under a sheet with a tube to the breather running under it.\"Hey! Remember all those mornings this summer that you made sure I was wide awake before you left for work? THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE!\" No. I'm not proud. But I felt like a teakettle releasing steam. Like the boiler at the Overlook Hotel right after Jack Torrance dumped it so it wouldn't blow. Fair is fair. Said the goose mentally to the gander. I might have hear a \"hmpf\" evaporate through the sheet. I went about my business of clothes-changing, and gathered myself some lunch and descended to my dark basement lair to inflict my annoyance on the blogosphere.At 3:00 p.m., Hick hiked all the way down the 13 stairs to ask why I had done such a thing. Was it really necessary? Yes. Yes, it was.\"You know how you felt when I barged in and woke you up? Well, multiply that by 60, and you'll understand how I have felt all summer long. Except that you just went back to sleep for another three hours.\"\"It's not like that at all. I WAS SICK!\"\"Yeah. So was I. I needed rest to recover, and I got none. All summer.\"\"Well, you should have gone to bed earlier.\"\"YOU should have gone to bed earlier! THREE HOURS earlier!\" \"It is totally different. There was no need for that.

He left around 1:00.\"\"Did you pay him already?\"\"Yes. I had one more job for him before I let him go. One of the closet doors in my bedroom is off the track. I used to be able to lift it back on the rail, but the wood is so heavy that I can't do it now. He put it right back on for me.\"\"Are you paying him by the job or by the hour?\"\"I don't know. I paid him $210.\"\"I guess that's all right. But if you were paying him by the hour, you got cheated. He could have been done in an hour and a half instead of five hours.\"\"Oh, it was well worth it for all he did. Those other people I call want so much more to do these things.\"\"Were you satisfied with his work?\"\"Well, I haven't been up on the roof, and the furnace isn't running in the basement, and we'll see about that foundation crack when it rains. But he DID show me a picture of the work he did around the chimney.\"\"And you believe that's really a picture of YOUR roof?\"\"Stop. Don't make me laugh. Yes, I believe him. But it seems like every time he comes out, he's always asking ME for the stuff to work with.\"\"What did he patch the roof with?\"\"Some metal that was down in the basement, on the work bench. It was like folded over flat metal. He said, 'This will work just fine.' So that's what he took.\"\"What about that foundation crack?\"\"Well, I had bought some stuff a while back, thinking I could do it myself, but I have not had a very productive summer. So I gave him that, and then I gave him a baggie, and he cut the corner off to squeeze it out. \"\"What was it? Did it come in a bag? In a bucket?\" \"Oh, it was a powder in a container, like a Cool Whip container, and he brought the rest of it back to me, and he had even written the date on it so I would know how old it was.\"\"How can you not know how you paid him? Didn't you agree on that before you hired him?\"\"No. But he always writes up a bill and goes over it with me so I know exactly what he's charging for.\"\"Yeah. That's a surprise. I guess you didn't pay attention.\"\"I looked at the amount. Then I got him the money.\"\"You didn't let him see you get it out of your safe, did you?\"\"No. I had put some bills in the back of my checkbook. I asked him if he wanted cash or a check. He said, 'Well, I'll take either one you want to give me. A check is fine. But if you have the cash, I'll take that.' So I started counting out the money, and he said, 'Oh, I don't want to take all of your cash. A check will be fine.' But I told him, 'I have ten dollars left, and that will last me until I can get to the bank and cash my little check I get every month.' I wasn't about to let him know I had more money than that.\"\"Never a simple answer from that guy.\"\"While I was counting out the money, he was sitting at the kitchen table with me, and he said, 'That part of your face there will go back to normal after the stitches come out. It won't have that big bump on it.' That's the part I was telling you about that I think sticks out.\"\"WAIT! He was commenting on your face while you counted the money! That is not appropriate. I swear! Did you let him run his dirt-encrusted hands over your stitches? You just don't know how to get rid of that guy. Maybe you should hire him to come back tomorrow and put on your triple antibiotic ointment.\"\"Oh, don't get me tickled! He's gone. I paid him. Now I can call the guy who wants to buy my truck. He said he would come out and get it. That I don't have to take it to his shop.\"\"You need a chaperone. Full time.

Not the fake facelift that her doctor told her he was doing on her face when he carved off her lingering lesion. No. Actual work. On her house. She has a guy she calls for these odd jobs. He works on his own, sometimes with his son, and he has a truck with his name and \"Handyman Services\" on the side.I call him Chatty Handy.He's the guy who replaced the silver aluminum drain plug thingy in my mom's white family-room bathroom sink with a blue one. She didn't know until after he left and she went in to check on the job. He's also the one who asked her for a check to take to the lumberyard, and she refused. She showed him! She rode along with him and wrote out that check herself.Today Chatty Handy was scheduled to fix three things. The DISH man had told Mom she had a leaky hole in the roof near her chimney. Mom said there was a crack in the foundation under the windows to her family room. The furnace in the basement does not blow hot air the way it used to, also according to Mom. Chatty Handy was due to arrive with his son between 8:00 and 8:30 this morning.I called Mom to see if she needed anything from the store. I was going back to tend her stitches, having removed her bandaid yesterday and slathered her with triple antibiotic ointment. I also told her to keep her hair off those stitches, and fished a cap out of her hall closet to keep her from wearing a hairnet kind of shower cap thingy she wears when she cooks. When I called around 9:00, she said she had been in the yard talking to Chatty Handy, who was going up on the roof. What they had been doing the other 30 or 60 minutes, I'm not sure, but I suspect they were chewing the fat.I did not arrive until going on noon. Mom was not sitting on the porch waiting for me as usual. Nor was she standing in the door, asking if I wanted help bringing in the bananas and Little Debbie Swiss Rolls I had picked up for her. I grabbed the bags (of course I got her a treat of Fiddle Faddle and a can of beer nuts, because she's my mom, and she's housebound for a few days) and went on in.Well! Chatty Handy was standing right there in the kitchen, jawing away, and he SCREAMED that I had scared him to death when I came in. Let the record show that the big wooden door was open, and all I did was click the latch on the full-length glass storm door, in plain sight of them, to walk in. That is my right, I think, as the new Thirteen-Dollar Daughter.Mom kept trying to scurry Chatty Handy on his way so we could get down to wound care. I had groceries suffocating under two winter coats in the back of T-Hoe. Chatty Handy does not pick up social cues very well. He kept on with a long-winded tale of some stroke victim without the use of her arm, and how one side of the brain controls the opposite side of the body, and how there is medicine that can do wonders with a stroke if given within one hour, and how with rehab, this lady might actually recover and be better than before, because that's what happens when a person survives a stroke. I'm shocked that he doesn't just chuck this whole handyman business and go on the lecture circuit with a medical team.Finally Chatty Handy made an exit, as I kept my head down, not engaging him, readying a box of bandaids, a tube of triple antibiotic ointment, a roll of paper towels, a cup of water, and a drinking straw. \"Hey! I have a boo boo on my hand? Think I can get a bandaid?\"\"No.\" That's it. Not engaging. I did not even look toward his hand. It could have been hanging by a sinew, and I would not have treated him. I thought he was just joking. He can get his own wound care specialist while he's hanging out with the stroke team. No sooner had I started wiping away yesterday's ointment than Chatty Handy returned up the steps from the family room.VAL: \"Am I parked in your way? Do you need to leave?\"CH: \"Oh, no! I still have to fix that foundation and the duct work in the basement. I guess I'll do it better if I take my tools.\" Chatty Handy headed out front to get his stuff from the truck. Who knows what he'd been doing for four hours. Talking, is my guess. He must have gone around the front of Mom's split-level home, because we were happily without his company for a good five minutes.I was just rinsing soapy water off Mom's stitches by dribbling water from a drinking straw when I saw Chatty Handy come in the sliding doors off the family room patio. Up the steps he came. \"I just wanted you to know that I filled in that crack. I used the baggie you gave me, and cut off the corner, and squirted it in the crack. I dug as far back as I could and pulled out all the broken stuff. I have an ice pick that I used. Here...\"MOM: \"Oh, you used an ice pick? No! You don't have to show me.\"Chatty Handy dug into his tool bag and brandished the ice pick like it was a prize-winning large-mouth bass. \"Yeah. You should be all right unless you notice your carpet getting wet. Or a smell, like mildew or mold.\"MOM: \"So it will be fine unless I smell mildew. I'll remember that.\"CH: \"Just between you and me, we've had a bathroom issue at home...that's all I'll say...but I told my wife, 'Quit spending so much on all those cans of air freshener. Just buy one of those wicks and set it on top of the air conditioner.' She said, 'Won't the dog bother it?' And I said, 'If he does, then he deserves whatever problems it gives him.' You know, you can also buy those filters to put on a furnace that spread a fresh smell.\"MOM: \"So it should be fine?\"CH: \"Yes. I'll go to the basement now. That will give that patch time to set up.\"VAL: \"MOM! Don't engage him! He'll only talk more!\"MOM: \"Well, I didn't think I was...but he just goes on and on.\"I had finished rinsing, and was fanning Mom's face with a folded paper towel to air dry it before applying the ointment. Here was Chatty Handy yet again, standing on the steps to the kitchen.CH: \"Did you kick up the thermostat like you said?\"MOM: \"Oh, yes. It's on 78.\"CH: \"That's good. I don't want to get blasted in the face while I'm working on the duct. I'll let you two get on with your visiting.\"Let the record show that I was FANNING MY MOM'S FACE WITH A PAPER TOWEL.

Yesterday I read a story about a three-year-old boy who rescued an elderly man who was locked inside his car on the church parking lot.Yeah. How can a man get locked INSIDE a car? He said the automatic-locker-thingy had been malfunctioning. But that does not explain how the preacher was able to open the car door from the outside. Also, why was a three-year-old running around by himself? I read that story over and over, trying to make sense of it, but I cannot. You can give it a try here.I was almost certain I was missing something in the story. You see, I have been a bit lax in my concentration lately.I swear I read a headline that said: \"Sandra Bullock Comes Face to Face With Shark After She Saw Him Stood Outside Her Bedroom Door.\" Okay. Major problem. The first thing I had an issue with was the \"stood\" part. Really? Shouldn't that have been \"standing\" instead? I chalked it up to coming from the UK Daily Mail. They talk funny in their writing over there. Then it hit me that what was \"stood\" outside her door was a shark! Dang! Where does Sandra Bullock live, anyway? Get back from the coast, girl! There was even a picture, like a split-screen kind of thing. Nobody was actually there when it happened, to capture Sandy and the shark in one frame. How wacky would THAT have been? So I looked at the photo, and I said to myself, \"Val, that is NOT a shark. That's a man. What's a man doing where a shark should be?\" So I read the headline again. Oh. It didn't say \"shark\" stood outside her bedroom door. It said \"stalker\" stood outside her bedroom door.Well. You can imagine my surprise when I discovered that little slip of the eyeball.And just before that little shark/stalker incident, I was reminiscing with The Pony about his three-week sojourn at Missouri Scholars Academy. The Pony had a stack of flyers that were given out each evening, listing the activities to choose from during free time the next afternoon. Some were quite interesting.\"Look at this one! Making Ethiopian paper heads! I'll bet that one was interesting. Did you do that one?\"\"Um. That says BEADS. Not heads. Making Ethiopian paper beads. That's a little different. I did not go to that one.\" Huh. I guess there's nothing left to say but, \"Nevermind.\""}, {"title": "The Infirmary Called. It Wants Its Bandages Back.", "date": "Wednesday, July 16, 2014", "text": "The report from sick bay is in. Both Val and Mom survived their respective procedures today at the hospital.As you may recall, Doctor scheduled Mom to come in on his day off to slice that growth off her face. He said he was doing us a favor to make it the same day as my repeat lung CAT scan. Never mind that I had been planning to drive Mom for her face-slicing, and she had been planning to drive me for my tranquilizer-enhanced CAT scan. We're the O. Henry pair of the medical procedure world.I swooped by to pick her up in T-Hoe, leaving The Pony on Mom's short couch to soak up high-speed internet and eat donuts. Her appointment was at 10:00, so I went up the elevator with her when we got there at 9:30, and kept her entertained until I had to go back down to radiology for my 10:30 appointment. Mom signed in and sat down, but I insisted that she go peck on the window and make sure Doctor was actually there on his day off to slice and dice. \"Oh, he's not here. Yes. He knows he's supposed to be here for you. But he's not here.\" No further explanation. Mom assumed they meant that Doctor was running late. She settled down a bit, but I could see that she was nervous. I hated to leave her there, but radioactive dye and a magnetic donut called to me. We agreed to meet downstairs in the radiology waiting area when we were done.Then the conundrum. When to take my tranquilizer? Doctor had prescribed a tiny pill. Ten tiny pills, in fact. I must be in for more procedures. Anyhoo, he had told me to take one an hour before the procedure. Hmpf! I took a practice one a couple weeks ago, when I had an appointment with a specialist, and it started working in 10 minutes, and by the time one hour had passed, I was as sober as Carrie Nation. So at 10:15, I swallowed that tiny tablet of 0.5 mg of lorazepam. I was called to the desk for ID and insurance info. Then I waited. And waited. At 10:45 I was taken back to the magnetic donut room.That was a bit shocking, because I thought I would be in a side room, or go to the lab for my IV needle. They have to shoot in saline, then radioactive dye. That's what they tell me. I don't look. The minute I recognized that magnetic donut room, I looked at the floor or the eyes of the IV inserter. Not at the magnetic donut. My anti-anxiety tiny pill had kicked in after eight minutes, and had now leveled out. I was able to refrain from running screaming from the room. I signed some papers. Laid down on that narrow metal bed that gets sucked into the donut. A technician put a pillow wedge under my knees for comfort. Told me to put my arms above my head (like I was going down a big water slide, I suppose), and to listen for the recorded lady's voice telling me what to do. Like inhale and hold it.Then, horror of horrors, that narrow bed began to move! I did not remember that from my first time from the ER. My eyes were closed then, and now. I guess with the IV morphine and Ativan back then, I made myself believe that I just laid there and they got their results long-distance from that magnetic donut. I could sense that I was in it. Then it spit me out. The guy came and said the dye was being injected. Yeah. I felt that rush. Then I was sucked back in and told to take another breath and hold it. I could heard my heart pounding. Lucky for me these tests only last about one minute once they get the dye in and feed me to the donut. Whew! Free at last!The IV gal removed my needle and fixed me up with gauze and that tight stretchy non-tape stuff. Look!She used my favorite color without even asking. And not a drop of my thinned blood spilled! Glad that's over.Next, I had to find Patient Records, so a copy of the results could be sent to my lung doctor at MoBap, even though he can access my records online. That meant I had to stand in the hall waiting for the patient ahead of me to send her records in private. I used that time to sober up from my little white pill. I had no sooner returned to the radiology area and sat down than Mom got off the elevator. We used our reunion to admire each other's bandages. She had a long beige bandaid stuck vertically in front of her left ear. We staggered back to T-Hoe, and picked up lunch for The Pony, and a frozen custard for ourselves.Next medical visit for me? Monday. Two of them. For Mom, Tuesday to get her stitches out.This has not been the Summer of Val that I had hoped for. But at least I'm still here to complain."}, {"title": "Another Day, Feet of Clay", "date": "Tuesday, July 15, 2014", "text": "Alas, perhaps I spoke too soon when reveling in my new-internetness.Oh, my new DISH satellite high-speed internet works like a charm, like a superstar, like a champ. But now, after the fact, after the telephone survey rating, I have discovered that my minivan-driving, plump, bearded, ginger of an installation technician hero has feet of clay.Redbeard was polite. His vehicle was clearly marked with the DISH logo, although it looked like he simply slapped a rectangular magnet on the family minivan. He parked in the driveway and walked up on the porch to knock on the door. I gave him a tour of the current DISH TV satellite location at the end of the porch. I told him he could drive his van through the yard to that end of the house so his equipment was handy. Then Hick showed up dragging his hose (you how guys are always showing off, trying to assert their superiority) and advised Redbeard on where he could screw his DISH. The phone rang, so I went back in the house.The twenty-eleven automated calls we had gotten from DISH over the two days prior to this installation advised us to \"put up your pets so they don't come in contact with our technician.\" Um. Yeah. No way were we going to hide two-score-and-seven chickens, two guineas, a turkey, four cats, and two dogs from the technician. It's not like they're that non-hug-needing raccoon in ELF that attacks Buddy's face. Both dogs were on the porch when I talked to Redbeard, and neither showed an interest in him. He was like the Rodney Dangerfield of intruders.My mom was on the phone, and while talking to her about something like her neighbor coming up behind her while she was bent over trimming the hedge, I heard both dogs baying like hounds after a fox. I considered ditching Mom to check on Redbeard, but...well...you don't cut your Mom short when she's talking on the phone. Then I heard Hick's Gator roar across the front yard like it was coming down the stretch on the final lap of a NASCAR event. The Backroads 500, perhaps. I figured that our fleabags had ripped a limb off Redbeard and Hick was rushing him to town for a re-attachment, or those dogs were simply excited as always by the mystery of the Gator, and were running after it on a new adventure.Later I was filled in on the details of the afternoon. Redbeard screwed that internet DISH onto the side of the porch. Hick saw him getting ready to use giant wood screws about six inches long to attach that DISH to the 2 x 6 boards at the base of the porch. \"Hey, buddy! Won't those stick out on the other side? Don't you have anything shorter?\" Redbeard confessed that he did not. \"I've got some over in my BARn. I'll go get them.\" So Hick had walked all the way around by the garage to get in his Gator and drive back across the yard to the BARn, when it was just as short for him to walk there and back to begin with. But at least the dogs got their hopes up for a longer run behind the Gator.In two hours, Redbeard, Genius, and a little bit of Hick had run some CAT5 through the basement ceiling, and had my satellite installed and my internet up and running. Redbeard told Genius, \"You'll get a call from DISH asking how I did. If you think I did a good job, please give me all ZERO ratings. That's the best. That's how I get contracted for jobs. The better my rating, the more work I get.\" Since the only issue had been Redbeard's screwing faux pas, I figured he deserved a good rating. After all, who answers the phone around here? Val. Rather than the next day, that survey call came a couple hours later. I gave Redbeard a ZERO in every category.It wasn't until the next day that the true nature of Redbeard was revealed.The Pony was the first to know. \"Hey, Dad. I got in the pool today, and I saw that the gutter is smashed.\" Hick went out the basement door to inspect.\"Huh. I saw Redbeard slip off his ladder once. The whole thing slid sideways. He bumped the downspout, with the ladder, but he was on the bottom rung and jumped off. Looks like he hit it again. The whole elbow is smashed. The two pieces that make the 90 degrees at the bottom. It's only about five dollars worth of guttering, but it's the idea. He could of at least told somebody that he smashed it.\"That crafty Redbeard. The length people go to, the depths to which they stoop, in order to garner a ZERO rating. I don't know how he can strap his kids into that minivan with a clear conscience, knowing what he did."}, {"title": "The Persistence of Memory (and I'm NOT Talking About a Painting of Limp Clocks)", "date": "Monday, July 14, 2014", "text": "Somebody around here has a memory problem.You might know the somebody I'm talking about. The somebody who once lost half a donut under his chair while in the hospital waiting for The Pony to come out of broken-elbow surgery. The somebody who left a banana peel stuffed in the cushions of his La-Z-Boy. The somebody who thought nothing of placing a paper plate holding the stub-end of a Subway Cold Cut Trio on the fake fireplace mantle and abandoning it for two days.Every morning, Hick has a sausage/egg/cheese muffin and a banana. He usually grabs these at 6:00 a.m. on his way out the door to drive to work. Last week he was on vacation. I suppose that threw him off a bit. Not the getting up and leaving at 6:00 a.m. part. Believe me and my bleary eyes, he still did that. But he must have varied from his breakfast of champions routine.The bananas are on the kitchen counter by the kitchen door. The better for Hick to grab one on his way out. I have to take them apart from the bunch, and lay them flat. Not to do a favor for Hick. But because they go bad faster if they're on the bunch. Some buttinskies helpful acquaintances have pointed out that there are stands from which to hang your bananas that keep them from ripening so quickly. Hmpf. We have gone through two of these stands. Trouble was, Hick did not grasp the bunch and pull a single banana loose. He grabbed one banana and yanked it until it came off. Which resulted in the destruction of two banana holders.Anyhoo...because the quality of store-bought bananas ain't what it used to be, the bananas sometimes get too ripe before Hick eats them up. I usually pawn them off on my mom, who loves ripe bananas more than she loves those tiny little banty eggs Hick saves for her. When I can't get rid of them soon enough, I have to move the ripe bananas away from the new bananas so they don't contagiously spread their overripeness. That is done by moving the riper bananas way down the counter, over the stove, almost to the fruit bowl of Granny Smiths. At no time do I move bananas to the cutting block in the center of the kitchen.Yet Sunday morning, I found a single banana on the cutting block. A whole banana. Not a peel. It was one of the good bananas. Two bad bananas were still cooling their peels at the end of the kitchen counter. \"Did you forget to eat your banana this morning? I found one on the cutting block.\"Hick: \"No! I ate my banana! I threw the peel to the chickens.\"Val: \"I was just wondering. Because somehow a banana got from the kitchen sink area way over to the cutting block.\"Hick: \"Maybe The Pony put it there.\"Pony: \"I didn't take a banana.\"Hick: \"Maybe you put it there.\"Val: \"No. I didn't move a banana.\"Hick: \"Well, I know I didn't. I ate my banana.\"The discussion continued on our way in T-Hoe to get a frozen custard.Hick: \"You think you remember things, but you don't. Like when you said we had a Jeep Cherokee.\"Val: \"I think we did. It was dark green, and something was wrong with the window, and you took off the door panel, so when I had to drive it, there was a bunch of exposed metal, and I could see how all the parts were hooked in.\"Hick: \"That dark green car was a Ford Explorer. And you never drove it. And I did not take the door panel off.\"Val: \"I may not know the make and model of cars, but I most certainly drove that green one, and there was bare metal on the door. Because you had trouble with the window motor.\"Hick: \"I think you're making that up.\"Val: \"How would I know what a door looks like without its cover? Or that a window has a motor?\"Hick: \"You never drive any of the other vehicles. Except that truck we got from your dad. That blue Silverado that you and Genius took to school.\"Val: \"All three of us took it to school because the battery was dead in my Suburban. AND we were embarrassed because it had that swimming pool in the back that you picked up that a guy was getting rid of, and the filter and hoses were up front, and Genius was riding on my hip and I could hardly steer, and The Pony insisted on wearing that blue-striped engineer cap from Silver Dollar City, and tooting on a wooden train whistle the whole way, with various hoses wrapped around his neck.\"Hick: \"That's the only one you drove.\"Val: \"I drove the Ford 250 that you have now.\"Hick: \"The brown one? No you didn't.\"Val: \"Yes I did. I used to tell you all the time that it scared me, because the brakes never seemed like they were going to stop the truck. I even had nightmares about it.\"Hick: \"You must have dreamed of driving it. The brakes only went out on it one time, when I was at My Number One Son's house. His father-in-law got onto me for driving it home, because the brakes didn't work. I had to use the emergency brake.\"Val: \"The brakes went out on it when Genius drove it.\"Hick: \"Maybe the other brakes went out on it, then.\"Val: \"No. You sent Genius to get a load of rock, and on the way back, he had no brakes, so he stopped on the bowling alley parking lot and called me, and I went to pick him up. Then when you got home, we took you to get the truck and drive it home.\"Hick: \"Oh, yeah. THAT's the time I drove it with no brakes.\"Pony: \"Um. Dad. You're really not in a position to argue about memory.\"Hick: \"I don't know. Maybe I picked up two bananas this morning.\"He is training me for a second career in the court system, cross-examining forgetful witnesses and perpetrators. I'm sure that's it.

A mission I usually tackle at the end of May. It's not so much that I'm a procrastinator (okay, I am, in everything but this mission) as that I had a good excuse this year, what with being in the hospital, weak as a kitten, barely able to draw breath.My mission involves clearing the wraparound porch of stinging insects. I accept that challenge every year, and, I might add, buffing my fingernails on the front of my yellow-pin-striped camp shirt, I do a bang-up job of it. No one has ever been stung on our porch. Hick bears the responsibility of his yearly stingings by the yellow-jackets whose nest he continually mows-over in the BARn field. The BARn field is not my jurisdiction.So, on the way back from a delicious, if problematic, frozen custard this afternoon, I declared to Hick and The Pony, from the shotgun seat of T-Hoe, that I was going to take care of those porch-ceiling nests as soon as we got home. It might have been the custard talking, but I was all pumped up and ready for some carnage. The Pony advised that I should also check the overhang of Juno's doghouse roof, because he has seen the enemy landing there. I agreed. I, too, had noticed the six-legged invaders staking out that territory. Heavens to Murgatroyd, I would not want my sweet, sweet Juno to have flashbacks to her puppyhood close call with those insects.I left on my town clothes. Did not even change into something more comfortable for killing wasps. Besides, Crocs are not the preferred footware for insect-spraying. I went in the back door, right under an enemy camp, marched to the laundry room, grabbed my can of killer, and returned to the back porch just off the kitchen. I could see that squatter Ann in Juno's house. Oh, well. In every war, there are bound to be casualties. Ann has such coarse german shepherd hair that I was not really concerned about her succumbing to a venom injection. \"Look out! I'm going to spray!\" I told her that just to be fair. Even though I'm sure my voice to her sounds like Charlie Brown's teacher.Slowly I turned. Step by step. Inch by inch. I crept toward that nest over the doorway. I know my personal insect-killing advisers told me to spray at night. However...we are talking about a world-class procrastinator who may or may not have been in the throes of frozen custard shock. Chocolate waffle cones don't eat themselves, you know. Now was good enough, to make sure it didn't slip my mind again. One lonely sentinel crawled across that papery nest. I shook the can of killer. Extended my arm, ready to flee like a novice lighting her first Blackcat firecracker. \"Take THAT!\" I pushed the built-in button on the plastic lid.A FINE MIST PUFFED OUT!Not a steady stream so powerful it knocked the nest from its lofty perch while soaking insects as much as a foot away with the backwash. Nope. And to make matters worse, the mist blew back toward my face on the gentle breeze coming off Poolio down below. CRAP!I moved closer and managed to get some poison on that sentry. I turned to Juno's house and puffed my mist up under her pointed eave. Six stinging waspers hovered at my waist. If insects can swear, I think I know what they were saying. Then they dropped, one by one, and began to writhe on the porch boards. I stepped over them and headed for the roof corner overlooking the fake goldfish pond. The goldfish are real. The pond is fake. Three wasps sat on that nest. I extended my can and gave them a good misting. Or not. Because who knew there was a spiderweb protecting their home until the webbing filled up with mist particles? I tried another angle. More web. Eventually I got those wasps damp, and they fell one by one. I gave them an extra dose. Just because. My travels around the porch revealed that our usual stinging guests must have left us for greener pastures this summer.I took my weapon back inside. Back to the laundry room, to the shelf over the washer. Where I saw two more cans, the most notable being the Black Flag Wasp and Stinging Insect Spray that claims to shoot 20 feet. Huh. In my hand was a can of Flying and Crawling Insect Spray, with pictures of a fly and an ant. Go figure.I wish I had known that before I moisturized those wasps to death."}, {"title": "Me And My Shadow, Laying on the Whirlpool Tub", "date": "Saturday, July 12, 2014", "text": "Here's a new one for you.

He's like one of those velcro hugging bears you get at Hallmark on Valentine's day. At the funeral home, I slide down the pew to talk to my favorite gambling aunt, and Hick slides with me like we're handcuffed together. If I'm in the kitchen heating meals in the oven or warming them in the microwave, Hick is right behind me trying to get a fork. When I wash the dishes (by hand, I might add, in case I have forgotten to inform you that I don't have a dishwasher), Hick stands across the sink, trying to scrub his poopy chicken eggs at the same time. When I call my mom, he chooses that moment to have a conversation with me. In the boudoir, I cannot get a moment's sleep for him jamming his arm under my pillow stack, elbowing me between the shoulder blades, or inserting that big-toe talon into my shin.I CAN'T BREATH!I told him that when we both retire, he's going to have to get another job to keep him out of the house. And it might not be a bad idea to run electric and water to his creek-side cabin complex when he tires of the BARn. Familiarity breeds contempt, you know. And absence makes the heart grow fonder. Or at least less annoyed.Can you tell that Hick has been on vacation this week?Here's the thing. Even when he's not with me, he's right on top of me. Yesterday, Hick changed clothes to get in Poolio for a relaxing float on the pool thingies I blew up with my clotted lungs. I had been to town, hauling Hick to get his Pacifica from the shop, then picking up some items at Save A Lot. When I got home in my in-public clothes, I saw Hick floating from the back porch. I went into our bathroom to change into my at-home comfy clothes, and saw the epitome of togetherness.We have a large, forest green, triangle bathtub with jets all around. The long edge of the tub is about six feet, with another 18 inches at each end of that which bend back toward the wall. I lay my sweatpants with the ever-growing hip hole on that tub edge. I don't stretch them out lengthwise, as if preserving a crease. I flop them over the edge, hanging limp like a Dali clock, until I want to wear them again.Horror of horrors, my loyal navy blue sweatpants with the white stripe down each leg were being smothered by Hick's Hanes tighty-whities! That is just wrong. He had the entire span of nine feet, less the one foot my sweatpants occupied, to lay his briefs.Even when I'm gone and he's gone, he finds a way to suffocate me."}, {"title": "Not Rare, Not Medium Rare, Not Medium, But WELL DONE!", "date": "Friday, July 11, 2014", "text": "Val Thevictorian comes to you this evening from the wild blue yonder. No longer does she find it necessary to squeeze herself down like Tim Allen in The Santa Clause to fit through a tiny stick attached to the lid of her Shiba, and out through the glass and screen of her living room window. Nope. Tonight she soars full-blown from the end of the porch, off a platter big enough to serve unlimited catfish, chicken, shrimp, fries, and hush puppies.I've gone and done it! Stick a fork in SPRINT--they're done!No longer will I be held hostage to their whim, charging me six times my monthly fee for allegedly using twice the bytage I was allowed with my mobile broadband stick. That is poppycock! Not only was it physically impossible for me to use that much, even if 10,000 Vals typed at 10,000 keyboards to post 10,000 blogs daily for 10,000 years...but they had overcharged us once before about a year ago, and Genius had called them and they agreed to the preposterousness of it all, and removed the overages. Not so this time. They gave Genius some lip, and were only willing to take off 1/3 of the cost in exchange for an upgrade in service. No thank you. Strong-arming Val is no way to go through life, SPRINT.Yesterday, an unassuming DISH contractor arrived in a minivan with a magnetic DISH logo on the door, and proceeded to drill holes in the porch railing, mount a new little DISH, tunnel through the concrete of the basement wall, attach a modem, and help the hooky-from-work Genius run some CAT5 cable so he could hook that modem into our existing router. Took less than two hours, and I am one happy internet hillbilly this afternoon. When I turn on my computer, the internet is right there waiting for me! No connecting. No loss of service. No reconnecting. No restarts. No giving The Pony a set of TV rabbit ears and having him stand on his head on the roof while trying to get a signal. Whoop-ti-freakin'-do!Genius congratulated me for joining the world of the early 2000s.Today I had the pleasure of calling SPRINT to tell them I wish to drop my broadband service. Hmpf! I felt like I was in a dark room full of interrogators, a blinding light shining in my eyes. WHY? Why did I want to drop my broadband? Because I have been unfairly overcharged twice, and it will not happen again. I will not continue to throw good money after bad service. On a given month, I do not go over my allotment. Occasionally, I have gone a smidgen over, which cost less that $20. Fair is fair. I did not complain. But when the overage tallies up to over $300, for using DOUBLE my allotment in one month, the farfetchedness begins.Let the record show that any little overage previously occurred in the summer months. Teacher. Home from school. Late hours. BUT this falsified trumped-up charge happened during the month of May. You know May. Mrs. Val Thevictorian had 15 minutes on the internet prior to leaving for work, then turned off her computer. She did not arrive home until after 5:00 p.m. Then she had her reality shows to watch part of the night. Oh, and there was that little business of Val being hospitalized for three days beginning May 23, and off the internet for an entire week due to feeling puny upon release.The nail in the SPRINT coffin was when the bill for June arrived, and showed that Val had used barely two-thirds of her internet allotment, even though she was home all day every day, still kept late hours, and was not away from internet for a week. Pretty fishy.Did the SPRINT folk try to make a deal to keep Val, the loyal, never-missed-a-payment, four-cell-phone-plan customer? Nope. Instead, they put Val on hold, with loud muzak, to await a supervisor to cancel the plan, because apparently, regular customer servicers are not allowed to drop options from plans. They are, however, allowed to ask if I contacted SPRINT regarding the disputed bill, while I'm sure they were looking at the futile efforts from Genius right there on screen, chuckling silently behind their headsets. Oh, and they insinuated that neighbors must have been stealing our internet since they could see that our usage was usually less than the allotment. Did you know that when you start service, the bill is pro-rated for the number of days you actually use it, but when you drop service, the option cannot come off the bill until the last day of the billing cycle, in this case August 1st? Funny how that works.I sent Genius a text telling him that SPRINT was being a feed-sack full of penises, and acting all fake sorry at my predicament. Fakers! Though I actually wanted to describe them with a couple letters different in that word. Genius agreed.Then he told me to stop texting him at work, because every three minutes I took from his day cost his employer a dollar.That boy may have a future with SPRINT when he graduates."}, {"title": "Jiving Mr. Crazy", "date": "Thursday, July 10, 2014", "text": "Perhaps I've mentioned Hick's penchant for stretching the truth a bit. Oh, in his mind, it's the absolute truth. Even though his truth has only a nodding acquaintance with reality.Take, for instance, the time he called home excitedly from a business trip to brag that he was staying two doors down from the home of Betty, the famous author, who had just died. Several return calls and detailed interrogation revealed the fact that he was visiting the boss of his company who lived two doors down from the estate of Katherine Hepburn, who had passed away two years earlier.You can understand why I take what Hick has to say with a grain of salt. And you don't have to be a doctor to recognize the basis for my hypertension. I make it a point to question Hick's declarations, lest I perceive an unintentional falsehood as truth. No need for Val to be a laughingstock if she repeats the story.Tuesday evening, Hick took The Pony and me to a local catfish house. The meal was delectable, if one enjoys crispy farm-raised catfish with tasty tartar sauce, peanut-oil-fried chicken breasts with a dipping sauce that is a mutation of BBQ and sweet & sour sauce, breaded shrimp with cocktail sauce, hush puppies with honey butter, steak fries with tangy ketchup, cole slaw (COLE SLAW!!!), baked beans, dill pickles, bread-and-butter pickles, sliced onions, and mason jars full of icy beverages. Not that each of us ate everything. I prefer the chicken and fish, Hick likes the shrimp and fish, and The Pony is partial to hush puppies, fries, and shrimp. We did consume two platters of the all-you-can-eat servings.Because that was not enough for Thevictorian family eaters, we then drove through a frozen custard stand for a single scoop. The Pony cried shenanigans, declaring that he had not been previously informed of the dessert run, and had eaten too much meal. Too bad, so sad. Cheaper custard for me and Hick.It was on the way home, sweaving the back blacktop roads of Backroads, that the latest inane Hickversation floated throughout the cabin of T-Hoe.Hick: \"See that house? That's where that song 'A Horse With No Name' lived.\"Val: \"A song lived in a house?\"Hick: \"No. The one that did the song.\"Val: \"I don't know who wrote 'A Horse With No Name.'\"Hick: \"Sang it.

Kind of like that horse. With no name.My BFF Google says that the dude who wrote 'A Horse With No Name' is still alive. So I had to dig a little deeper. It seems that what Hick meant to say was that one of the guys in the band America, who had a big hit called 'A Horse With No Name' died three years ago, in that house we passed in the town that has a catfish restaurant and a frozen custard stand.Who knew that Hick was a reader of The Rolling Stone?"}, {"title": "Sometimes a Not-So-Great Notion", "date": "Wednesday, July 9, 2014", "text": "Hey!

Problem is, I haven't been my jolly old self this summer. I have not felt much like writing at all until this week. The urge comes and goes. One thing I'm considering is a bundle of stories comprised of Hick's tall tales. I have been mulling a title such as \"Post-Dramatic Jest Syndrome.\" He has such a flair for going over-the-top. It's like the material writes itself, what with my interrogation leading to farther- and farther-fetched details. As a special treat, I've got his most recent story slated to post tomorrow.However...that title may be considered politically incorrect, like it's ridiculing a medical condition that folks don't find the least bit funny. Like a fraternity throwing a wet t-shirt bash and calling it \"The Boobonic Keg.\" So...is that kind of thing frowned upon? Is that wrong? Because if I had known when I started thinking up titles that I should not have done that...well...Never mind. I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself. No need to put the title before the proposed collection. There'll be time enough for titling (heh, heh, I said TITling) when the compiling's done. Excuse me.

No, she just wants that smaller-than-a-dime pink scaly dot gone from in front of her left ear.I, on the other hand, have used up all my comedy bits to distract her in the waiting room. I'm going to have to write some new material for next Wednesday. No. I can't. Because that dastardly Doctor scheduled her to come in on his day off a half hour before MY lab test to look into my lungs for embolisms. So I will not be able to entertain her worries away. I suppose she will be fine. There shouldn't be much of a wait since it's Doctor's day off.Yes, I was in rare form Monday. I stopped just short of concluding with, \"Thank you, I'll be here all week.\" Because nobody wants to be in the doctor's waiting room all week. As we sat side by side, with a chair in between us holding our purses, in the solitude of the kid/TV waiting area down in the corner that was empty save for us, I speculated on her upcoming procedure.\"I guess he'll have you lay on your side on the exam table. If you don't want to lay down, tell him! Tell him you're not comfortable, and they'll prop you up.\"\"Yes. They usually ask if I want a pillow.\"\"Tell him that you're nervous. Maybe he'll give you something. You can be all doped up. I'll drive you home.\"\"Oh, I don't want to tell him that I'm nervous.\"\"You know how your blood pressure goes up when you get in the office? Tell him you're nervous. He needs to know. I'll tell him for you as I walk you in.\"\"You don't have to do that.\"\"I want him to take care of you. I'll wait until he gives you that shot to deaden your face, then I'll probably come back out. I don't want to sit there. I'll be in the way. And nobody wants an audience when he's carving on a face. I don't want it to be like a Gallagher show. I don't have a plastic raincoat.\"\"You can stay if you want.\"\"No. But I wish I'd brought some Junior Mints.\"\"Why? I have some mints. But they're peppermint. I always bring some for Karen, the nurse. Then I found out that Doctor takes them from her. So the next time, I brought him a bag, too. But today I didn't bring any. I was just here last week.\"\"Great! The day you're having your skin lesion removed, you forget the peppermints. And now I'm going in with you, and they'll think it's MY fault! I'm not about to have peppermint on my breath.\"\"I was so glad I'm getting this over with that I forgot. But you want Junior Mints?\" \"Haven't you seen Seinfeld? If I had a box of Junior Mints, I could offer one to the doctor as soon as he sliced open your face. Then he might say, 'I don't WANT a Junior Mint!' and knock my hand away. And a Junior Mint could sail through the air and land right in your incision. They have excellent healing properties, I'm told.\"\"Oh, that's terrible!\"\"Yeah. At first they thought a Junior Mint might be the cause of a terrible infection. But don't worry. It was a life-saver!\"\"Did you hear that? I only ate my Little Debbie Brownie with my medicine this morning.\"\"Um. That was somebody coughing like he has diphtheria over there in that other office complex.\"\"Oh. I thought it was my stomach growling.\"\"What are you, some kind of stomach ventriloquist? That noise was clearly over there behind that wall. Not right beside me in your stomach.\"\"That's really embarrassing. I hope no one else heard it.\"\"Why would you care if they heard some guy cough? It wasn't your stomach.\" I think Mom has seen too much of that Jack Links Jerky commercial with the guy in the board meeting and that wolf in his stomach.

Sometimes, life is an interconnected Seinfeld episode. And most times, there are no coincidences.I set off to take my mom to the doctor this morning to have a skin lesion removed from her cheek. Here now! Be civil. The cheek on her FACE, people! Stop being 13 years old, would you? I wanted to drive her in case she didn't feel well with fresh stitches in her face, right beside her left ear. Mom has had other skin cancers removed in years past, and said the only part that bothered her was hearing the doctor saw through her skin like leather.Because I also wanted to talk to my own doctor, who happens to be Mom's doctor as well, I tried to call and see if they could work in an appointment with me around the same time as Mom's. I needed to talk about my recent medical test results from a specialist. I did not want a free consultation. My two insurance companies are perfectly capable of paying for an office visit. However, after staying on hold for ten minutes long distance because my cell phone carrier is crap and won't hold a connection for ten minutes, I gave up and slammed down the END button on my receiver. I barely had time to throw on my in-public clothes and round up The Pony to get out the door on time to pick up Mom.On the way to town, my best ol' ex-teaching buddy Mabel texted to ask how my mom was doing. She knew I was taking her this morning for her lesion excision. I had my assistant, The Pony, read and send my messages. Val is a safe driver, not a sweaver. I said I was on the way to take Mom to the doctor, and that she was just a little nervous, but that I would walk her in to try and talk to the doctor while Mom was deadening. You know, from the local anesthesia. Mabel said she had been praying for everything to turn out right for Mom. Mabel is a world-class prayer, and the best ol' ex-teaching buddy and friend a Val could have.We left The Pony at Mom's house to soak up some high-speed internet. Mom went to the window of the doctor's office and signed in. I waited, waving at the receptionist so she would open the window. \"I need to talk to Doctor about some test results from a specialist he referred me to. Can you work me in around 11:00? I brought my mom in for her appointment at that time.\"\"Well...you can go in the room with her and talk to Doctor there.\" Oh, well. Their loss if they don't want to garner a payment from my insurances for our diagnostic tete-a-tete.The wacky nurse called Mom back, and when I jumped up to follow, I thought she was going to take me out at the knees. \"What are you doing here?'\"That's my mom. I brought her over, and I'd like to go in with her.\" It wasn't until after Mom had buttered up Wacky with some peppermints from her purse that I asked if I could speak to Doctor when he came in.\"Well, I guess so, because you're in here, and he'll be in here.\"We didn't have to wait long. Doctor came in and told Mom what he planned to do. Then he said he had a minute to talk to me, that the specialist had called him personally about my refusal, and what did I need to know. Then he explained things much more clearly, specifically the things that would happen concerning my biggest fears about the procedure, and how doctors can work around that. Much of my concern was about coming off the blood-thinner for five days in order to do the procedure. Then Doctor turned to my mom.\"Are you still taking your blood-thinner?\" Only he did not call it a blood-thinner, but by its name, which was something like Pterodactyl, which is similar to my Xarelto, but I don't care to take time and effort to look up its real name.\"Yeeesssss. Nobody told me to stop it. I always tell my dentist, and he says, 'Ah, there's no need to quit that!'\"\"Yeah, Mom, but that's probably why your face is bruised for a month after you visit the dentist.\"\"I'm sorry. I can't do your procedure today. You're still on the Pterodactyl. If I did it, you would bleed to death here in my office. Slicing your face open is a little different from the dentist sticking your gums with a needle.\" Um. Perhaps he didn't need to be quite so dramatic. I think Mom got the point.Let's review, shall we? Life's rich tapestry, a thread for Mom to have her lesion removed, a thread for Val to make an appointment to talk to her doctor alone, a thread for Mabel's prayers...Such a different outcome it could have been, if Mom went in alone and Doctor did not have blood-thinners on his mind due to Val's badgering about her own health issue. Several threads intertwined in that tapestry this morning. What set those separate stories in motion to later link up like a Jerry/George/Kramer/Elaine plot?Mabel, I'm going to call you The Snagger.

Val was a victim of a heinous crime this morning. Two heinous crimes, in fact. I know you're shocked. Val is generally not a victim. She pulls herself up by her own bootstraps and soldiers on. No use crying over spilt milk. Val rarely utters a tiny whine about the unfairness of life. Wait! Why are you all looking at each other like that? With the raised eyebrows and all? Huh. Must be some private joke amongst you.I was a victim of HIGHWAY ROBBERY today when I did the weekly Walmart shopping! Seriously. I don't know how people live these days. My bill was over a hundred and seventy dollars! For three people in my household. I didn't even buy meat! Of course, there were those four floatie things I got for Poolio because we were having kid company today. But they didn't cost a hundred and seventy dollars.When I looked over my receipt, I saw that fruit alone cost me thirty dollars. Fruit! Nothing exotic, either. Just bananas, green grapes, red grapes, strawberries, and Granny Smith apples. No, I did not buy a pallet of each. Thirty dollars! Why, folks could get 20 McDonald's double cheeseburgers for that, and have protein!My best ol' ex-teaching buddy, Mabel, has take to buying her produce at Aldi's. Of course, now that she is retired, and on a forever vacation, she has time to drive across the county for her produce needs. Not this ol' Val. By the time I would drive to Aldi's, the cost of gas would negate any savings. Don't even ask me about Save A Lot. Their produce is not their strong point. They did have some pretty plums the other day, but I only went in for BBQ meat, so I passed them by. Who's sorry now? VAL!The other crime of which I was a victim was BATTERY! Okay, not me so much as Granny Smith. You know how you look through the apples, and make sure you get the ones that are the prettiest and most shapely, without blemishes? That checker slammed my bag of Granny Smiths onto the top of the bag carousel like she was Hulk Hogan slamming Randy Savage. Or Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura slamming Dick the Bruiser in a cage match. What is with these checkers? Get yourself a wrestling persona and an arch nemesis, and quit taking out your aggression on my fruit! I swear, I wanted to say, after grunting with disgruntlement, of course, \"Uh! Why don't you go back and get me a new bag of Granny Smiths, since you just bruised the ones I picked out?\" But I didn't. Val keeps a civil tongue in her head in public.Poor Granny Smith. Now she is the victim. I daresay she busted a hip, and will now need the beeper chair to get through Walmart. She oughta take her cane and shake it at that checker: \"Lay off my hip, you maniac!\" I feel bad for not standing up for Granny. But that would have taken valuable time. I had already waited behind a lady in a beeper cart who stood up to put out her groceries, then sat down and drove forward to the payment card keypad. She wanted to pay ten dollars with a check, and the rest with a debit card of some kind. When it didn't work, she told the checker, \"Don't worry, I have cash.\" Not that I blame her for wanting to pay in her own way. I just wanted the checker to advance the conveyor so I could get the rest of my stuff on it, rather than let it sit there idle, a good four feet of bare conveyor between me and the scanner. I couldn't move forward to put the rest of my stuff in front, because the beeper cart lady was parked there.Walmart needs a big WANTED poster area on their bulletin board.

Hick grilled some pork steaks and hot dogs on Gassy-G. They were succulent, the pork steak, anyway, because I have not tried a hot dog yet. I must admit Hick is a world champion griller.I took my mom a pork steak and a couple of hot dogs today. I don't know if it's a driveway thing, or if she was in a hurry to get out, but when I called and offered her my leftovers, Mom asked if she could meet me in town. She had to put one of her checks in the bank, and then she was going in Dollar Tree, to spend her money, I guess. Of course, being Mom, she had an adventure. We'll get to that later, after today's complaint.Mom wanted to meet on the parking lot of Dollar Tree. There's also a CeilingRed's pharmacy on that parking lot, and a beauty shop supply store, and some kind of auto parts establishment. So you would imagine a few of the parking spots to be filled at 10:00 on a Saturday morning. However...you would not expect almost all of the parking spots to be filled by pickup trucks pulling trailers loaded with Jeeps. BUT THEY WERE. I could almost not make the turn in off the street because of how one was parked, and I could barely see Mom's Blazer in the middle of their circle. Not one, not two, not three, but FOUR trucks hauling four trailers loaded with more than four Jeeps, because two of them had double Jeeps. That's ridiculous. It's not good for business. Why can't they meet on the Walmart parking lot like sensible people? I guess that's the price we pay for having an off-road area at the Backroads state park.Once I found her, Mom got right into telling me about today's weirdo. I know I inherited this weirdo-magnet gene from her.\"I pulled up to the drive-thru, because it's Saturday, and the lobby isn't open. While I was waiting, I saw an old man standing at the drive-thru where they service people who have businesses. He had gotten out of a truck that was parked in the bank parking lot. I was trying to listen in. He wanted to cash a check, but he didn't have any ID. The girl kept telling him that they could not cash his check. You know. She's the one who gave me a hard time about cashing my check that I've cashed there for over ten years. But it wasn't because of my ID. She told him that if the main lady was there, and recognized him, she might have been able to cash it, but because of bank policy, the people working there today couldn't do it. I felt sorry for him. He kept saying, 'But what am I going to do for money? I need to cash this check.' Wouldn't you think that since he drove that truck, he should have a driver's license?\"\"Yes! He was probably a scammer. Don't feel sorry for him.\"\"Well, I wanted to tell him, 'I think there are places where you can go and get checks cashed, besides banks.' But then he would have known I was listening, and he might have been embarrassed.\"\"Yes, there are check-cashing places. There's one right over there, between Little Caesar's and Terrible Cuts. That guy was scamming. He probably walked to the business drive-thru thinking they wouldn't know he drove a truck there. Maybe he had a check that he stole out of a mailbox. Remember that ring that was taking mail from boxes with the red flag up, and getting checks out of utility bills, and marking out the utility and writing in their name? And banks were CASHING THEM! That teller should have called the police. If she had seen him get out of the truck, she could say, 'I'd like to report a man driving without a license.' Yeah. She could have caught him.\"\"Surely he knew that he needed his driver's license on him if he was driving. And he didn't have ANY ID.\"\"That's what they do when they don't want to be caught scamming. Stop feeling sorry for him.\"I'm glad she didn't offer him money. That was unlikely, though, because Mom is pretty tight with her finances. It must be because she's a child of the Great Depression, and had to go with only one shoe that time her brothers threw one of hers out the car window.Come to think of it, Mom did not even offer me five dollars today, even though I gave her a pork steak, two hot dogs, three buns, and two brown bananas.The Five Dollar Daughter needs to try harder. I'm taking Mom to get some minor surgery on Monday, and if she feels okay, later in the week I'm taking her to see that new Melissa McCarthy movie.

What's that? You didn't know Mom had a truck? Most people don't. She keeps it in the garage until she needs to drive it to the county landfill, where she sees that worker who wears a suit and is really polite to her. He gives her the creeps. Bet you didn't see that coming.Mom's truck is over 20 years old. Every now and then, she takes it out for a spin. Like twice a year, when she picks up The Pony at school so he can spend the night. Other than that is too much. No need to wear out that truck. My nephew, son of my sister the ex-mayor's wife, borrows the truck in bad weather so he can drive it to his job in the city. Never mind that he makes more than I do, what with my over-25-years of teaching, in his entry-level job with a utility company. No need for him to buy his own truck when he can leave his 4wd vehicle for his wife to drive, and take Mom's truck home until the bad weather is over.My mom has been having trouble with her truck. At first she thought it was an old battery. She had Hick jump it a few times. Took that truck out for a drive around several country blocks to charge it. Yet still, the battery lost its power. Mom had Hick take the battery out, and she took it to Walmart to trade in on a brand new battery. Hick put it in for her a month or so ago.Mom went out to drive her truck to the landfill last week, but the battery was dead. Hick was going to look at it the last time he mowed her yard, but she told him not to, because it was the hottest day of the year, and her garage is even hotter. Yesterday Hick went looking for his voltmeter or some such diagnostic tool so he could go check out Mom's truck. Genius has apparently absconded with the meter. Lucky for Hick that he has at least two of every tool. He found another one in the BARn, and set off for Mom's house. The purpose was to hook that meter up to several in-truck sources, to see if there was a power drain. If, for example, there was some short keeping on the radio or the overhead light.When Hick got home, I asked if he fixed Mom's truck. \"Yep. It was easy to fix. The glove box light was on. The door looked closed, but it wasn't latched. So that light was on inside the glove box all the time, but you couldn't see it. I closed the glove box and charged her battery. She should be good to go.\"Mom doesn't remember opening the glove box, but assumes that she did. I pointed the finger at my nephew. \"Oh, he brought that truck back in April, and it has been sitting in the garage ever since.\" Exactly. But Mom is taking the rap. No word on whether Hick was compensated for his trouble. I'm sure he was. I'm just hoping Mom didn't pay him with a bottle of wine so old that it has fermented itself back into being unfermented again. We have to keep Hick healthy so he can repair Mom's truck."}, {"title": "No Good Dictionary Should Go Unread", "date": "Thursday, July 3, 2014", "text": "Here's a tale from Hick, heard as we chewed the fat amidst his master sweaving amongst six lanes of traffic on our way back from my doctor's appointment.\"My buddy said that back before the 7-Eleven went out of business, he used to buy gas there all the time. One day he saw a checkbook on top of the gas pump. He looked inside, and saw a stack of twenties. The lady's name and address were on her checks. He knew it was just up the road, so he took it and drove to her house and knocked on her door. 'I found this and thought you'd want it back,' he told her. She thanked him, and started counting the money there in the doorway, in front of him. He figured his good deed was done, so he started back to his car. When he got to the end of the sidewalk, the lady hollered, 'Wait a minute! There's a twenty missing!' Buddy turned and said, 'I didn't take your money.' He got in his car and left. He said who would be stupid enough to only take a twenty when there was over three hundred dollars there.\"\"Oh. So he counted it?\"\"No. When the lady was counting, he heard her go past three hundred dollars as he was walking away. The lady called him later at home. She had asked who he was when he returned it. She looked him up. She said, 'I'm remembered that I spent that twenty. I'm sorry for accusing you of taking it.' And Buddy said, 'Screw off, lady!' and slammed the phone down.\"\"I don't know why he had to do that.\"\"Because she accused him of being a thief and taking her money, when all he had done was return it.\"\"I know. But she had already accused him. Then she called to say she was sorry.\"\"Yeah. But she didn't even apologize. That's the point.\"\"Um. She said she was sorry. Isn't that what an apology is?\"\"Well, she accused him of taking it!\"\"I know. But she already did that. All she COULD do was call him and say she was sorry. She didn't have to do that.\"\"But that wasn't enough.\"\"What else could she have done? She couldn't take back accusing him. She didn't have a time machine. That part was done. Going forward, all she could do was tell him she was sorry.\"\"He wanted an apology, I guess.\"\"I don't know what dictionary you guys use, but I'm pretty sure the definition of apology is saying that you're sorry.\"\"Well. He was offended and he was mad, because he did the right thing and got accused.\"Somewhere, there's a moral to this story.

Unable to leave. With only my air conditioned house, dark basement lair, laptop, desktop, low-speed internet, DISH network, big-screen TV, and two recliners to keep me company. Woe is me. The Pony went to spend the night with his grandma. Hick took my T-Hoe for an inspection. And here I sat. Not even a trip to town to interact with humanity.As with every evening, I ascended from my lair to await Hick's arrival. Most days he's home around 4:40 p.m. I find out what he wants me to warm in the oven or heat up in the microwave. Then we go our separate ways. Today he did not arrive. I waited. Watched Jeopardy. Watched a Seinfeld rerun (The Hamptons, with the breathtaking baby, the stolen lobsters, and shrinkage--a classic). I finally called Hick. Funny how he did not let me know he would be late. An hour wasted. Dead time.Hick said he had something come up at work. It never entered his mind to call and let me know he would be late, even though he left at the time he normally gets home. \"What does it matter? You have your little buddy back.\" Um. No. He was well aware that The Pony went to Grandma's. \"What...he didn't leave until after 1:00, did he? So you've only been here a couple of hours.\"\"No. He left at 11:00. I didn't have my car. I've been waiting to make your supper. And now Genius has called, and said he's coming by tonight to pick up his new monitor that got shipped here yesterday. He's not staying. Just picking it up. So that's going to take up more time out of my schedule.\"\"Schedule?\" Hick laughed. LAUGHED! \"You want us to do things at certain times to fit your plans.\"\"Um. YES! That's what a SCHEDULE is!\"\"Things will happen when they happen. You don't need a schedule.\"Thus, the problem. Hick has always been like that. Before we were married, he would walk across the townhouse parking lot to knock on my door and ask me to go for a ride. Sure. I figured I had time for a Saturday ride. Leave at 11:00, back around 1:00 or 2:00. Perhaps stop for lunch. Nope. Not on a Hick ride. He never said where we were going, or when we'd be back. If I didn't know him already, I would have suspected he was some ne'er-do-well, driving me deep into the back woods, never to be seen again. After one of his six-hour rides, I was always dehydrated and famished.When his boys came for the weekend, they, too, wondered when they would get their next meal. I even took it upon myself to fill Hick in on his time management problem. \"Those boys like the eggs and hot dogs with garlic powder that you make them for breakfast. But they tend to get hungry before 6:00 p.m. You might want to think about giving them lunch in between. Or a snack.\"\"They're fine. They're kids. They know they're going to eat sometime.\"Yeah.

I know. The trials and tribulations Val must endure when her menfolk are unavailable.You might recall that our roadside mailbox, EmBee, has undergone her own trials and tribulations. She stands strong among her peers, refusing to acknowledge the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that have been inflicted upon her by the local ne'er-do-wells. Yes, EmBee is still her sturdy green thick metallic tube-self. Her cubby is cracked at the bottom of one wall, a good two-to-three-inch gap allowing access into the cubby of the white thin-skinned metal mailbox on the right, all dented and non-door-closing. You name it, the ne'er-do-wells have tried it. That row of more than a dozen mailbox cubbies has been rammed with a truck, beaten with a bat, pounded with a hammer, poked with a pole, probably bombed with an M-80, and would be a candidate for distressing with a heavy link of chain if those ne'er-do-wells would stay off the back roads long enough to watch some home improvement shows.As I was fetching my own mail every USPS delivery day for three weeks, I had to remind myself to be careful as I pried open EmBee's round metal door. Sometimes stinging insects come out. And most recently, a fine feathered stranger flew out. It was quite startling. One minute I'm pulling down EmBee's door, stepping back to avoid a wasp in the face, and the next minute a little brown bird is beating its wings to make an escape from that white mailbox next to EmBee. That happened at least five times. Every time, I told myself to be ready. I thought I was. Yet still my reflexes sent me reeling away. Flap-flap-flap! Such a commotion for such a little bird.Yesterday, I cautioned The Pony as he climbed out of T-Hoe to get the mail. \"Be careful. There's a bird in that white mailbox. It'll fly out and surprise you.\"\"Okay.\"The Pony was cautious. On the ready. But no bird flew out. He thought I was crying wolf. Today, I warned him again. He gave me that look that implies that he thinks I'm crazy, but he's too polite to put it in words. He stepped up to EmBee. Leaned away from the white mailbox. Opened EmBee. AND JUMPED BACK AS A BIRD FLEW OUT OF THE WHITE MAILBOX.The Pony looked at me and shook his head. I saw a little smile under where his faint mustache sits above his upper lip. He climbed into T-Hoe, the seat behind me, of course, as he is wont to do, and laughed.\"There is not a bird in that white mailbox. It's in OUR mailbox. It goes under the side, through that crack, to get out when we open the door.\"\"How do you know? It looked like it's in the white mailbox to me.\"\"Um. Because there's a NEST right behind our mailbox, with three little blue eggs in it. That bird sits on the nest until we open the door, then it flies out to get away.\"Huh. It's a little brown bird. The eggs, according to The Pony, are blue with some speckles. Probably some kind of finch. I can't imagine what it will feel like to hear a bunch of cheeping babies while trying to extract the mail from EmBee.It's a good thing that duty will fall on The Pony's withers."}, {"title": "A Little Knowledge Is a Dangerous Thing", "date": "Monday, June 30, 2014", "text": "The Pony returned Saturday from his three-week sojourn on the Mizzou campus at Missouri Scholars Academy, all smarted up from daily classes in writing and problem-solving. Those are the two areas he chose for his major and minor.He deposited two suitcases full of dirty clothes, a packsack stuffed with writing accouterments, a bucket of toiletries, and two canvas shopping bags (one Walmart, one Barnes & Noble) containing odds and ends, near and on the two living room couches and coffee table. That meant that if Hick or I was in the La-Z-Boy, the other had to ensconce himself on the vacant cushion of the short couch. Let the record show that I made it my mission to secure the La-Z-Boy.Poor Pony. He left us a 5'6\", 130-something-pound strapping specimen of nerdhood, and returned a 125-pound waif. He has been feeding well over the past two days. I foresee a complete recovery.Sunday I set him to harvesting various loads of laundry from those two suitcases. Funny how now that he's home, he's forgotten how to wash his own clothes. I did scam the leftover quarters from the ten-dollar half-roll that his grandma gave him to take to the Academy. I figure it was for doing his laundry, and I'm doing his laundry. To the laundress go the spoils!This morning I woke up with a pain in my toes. The two smallest toes on my left foot. The little piggy that had none, and the little piggy that went WEE WEE WEE all the way home. Most mornings I awake to various aching joints. But the toes were new achers. I was puzzled for about an hour. Huh. Did my feet hurt yesterday in Save-A-Lot? Did my shoes feel too tight? Did I get stepped on by a minipony? No, no, and no. Then it all came back to me.The Pony had just fished underwear and socks out of his small suitcase. It was wedged on its side between the long couch and the coffee table. Hick had been sitting on the short couch. I got up to turn on the washer, and rammed those hungry and loud piggies into the bottom of The Pony's small suitcase. I did not ram them on the curvy corner that is flexible, like the cartilage of a dolphin's fin. No. I rammed them on those hard plastic posts that are used as feet for the suitcase when you let go of its pull handle and park it while waiting in line. I would not want to see a slow-motion re-enactment, because I imagine those two toes bent all the way back against the side of my foot, as if they had no bones. I cannot bring myself to look and see if they are purple. I know they are facing the right way, because I got my shoe on this morning. And they feel just fine now in my red Crocs.Of course I blame Hick for my accident. Val is not one to careen through the house willy-nilly, slamming into objects in plain sight. If not for the stretched-out short feet of Hick, narrowing my pathway between the couches, I would have completed my journey free and clear. It's his fault, really, that I almost dislocated my toes. And to rub salt in that closed wound, Hick made his turned-up-nose, rolling-eyes face when I screamed in pain. That man is so histrionic! He might as well try for a Tony. He has not even noticed that The Pony is a shadow of his former self.One trip. Two casualties. I think The Pony and I will both recover."}, {"title": "I Met My Old Beggar on the Interstate Off-Ramp Thursday Afternoon", "date": "Sunday, June 29, 2014", "text": "I met my old beggar on the interstate off-ramp Thursday afternoonHe didn't even see meI just smiledAnd he waved a cardboard begging signAnd all the other cars passengers ignored himStill crazy, amongst those idling gearsHalfway back from my doctor's appointment Thursday, Hick pulled off the interstate to find some lunch. There was a dude sitting on the exit ramp, in the lane where people make a left turn to go into town. He was sitting on his backpack, holding a sign that looked like a flap off the end of a cardboard box. Written on it, in Sharpie, perhaps, \"Need Help.\" \"You know, I don't mind to give money to somebody who really needs help. But I'll be darned if they're going to make a fool of me like some of those I read about. You know, the ones who do this for a living. They always need gas money, or will work for food, but they're not traveling. They live here. And if you give them food, they toss it away. In the meantime, they make a couple hundred dollars a day, tax-free. Then go get in their car and drive to their house.\"\"Yeah. You never know if they really need it.\"\"Check his shoes. Are they worn?\"\"Nah. Just black tennis shoes.\"\"That backpack he's sitting on looks kind of ratty. But it would be, if he sits on it every day. I don't see any kind of traveling stuff hanging off of it.\"\"He doesn't look like he's missed many meals.\"\"Yeah. You would think he'd put on a shirt to cover his belly. His cut-off jeans are kind of ratty. But maybe that's his uniform. For begging. I wonder how many days he's been here. Or how many hours. Maybe he makes a couple hundred dollars a day. Tax free. Just sitting on the road, holding a sign.\"\"You never know.\"\"This is a big enough city that there are places he can get help. I can't believe the police let him sit out here on the interstate ramp.\"This is why we need to license beggars. So they can have a badge that says they're real beggars. Really in need. Not scamming. But I suppose the real beggars would sell their badges to fake beggars, so they have money without working to beg. And the fake beggars would use the badges to organize a group and have their minions sit in the sun all day, then take a cut of their beggins.No solution here.

No, it wasn't the insurance-info-taker who told me I reminder her of her ex-husband's new wife. It was the various lab-testers who came to pick up the paperwork and call their testees. Heh, heh. I said testees!They would grab the form, peer at it a moment, and then start walking around the large waiting room full of waiters. Let me tell you, almost ever seat was taken. Hick and I had to settle for two chairs in a corner, with a table between them, under the TV. So all we heard was the sound of Chester Lampkin giving the weather. It's a good thing the grabbers walked around looking for their grabbees.At first, I thought the Grabbers were playing some kind of game. Like somebody was telling them through a tiny ear receiver, \"You're warm. Warmer. Cold! Cold! Warm. Warmer. RED HOT!\" Then they knew they were standing in front of their Grabbees. Silly me. It dawned on me that I had given my driver's license to the info-taker. Obviously, they had printed out a picture on the form, so that the Grabbers were just looking for a particular face.When my Grabber came, she took a few minutes. Of course, she DID have to go from one corner of the room to the opposite corner to find me under the TV. She stopped in front of me, a fairly pregnant bespectacled lady in scrubs, her blond hair pulled back in a ponytail. \"Val?\" I was so proud of her, I almost clapped. I got up and followed.When we cleared the waiting room and started up the hall, I said, \"I guess it's a good thing it took you a minute to recognize me from that driver's license photo. It's terrible! This gives me hope that it doesn't really look like me. It's so hideous that even my mom laughs.\"Grabber kept walking. \"Oh, I haven't seen your photo. There are no pictures on our paperwork.\"Huh! How do they do it? Are those Grabbers like Long Island Mediums? Do they try to judge by height and weight? Or did she know that info-taker's ex-husband and had met his new wife, and info-taker put a note on there about it? I never did figure out how Grabber knew my identity...even though we spent some intimate time together.As for the elephant...this was no case of the elephant in the room. As we cruised up I-270 in the middle of six lanes, traffic flying by on both sides, I saw a curious sight. That's because I was pointedly ignoring Hick with his one eye, sweaving like a master, taking one hand off the wheel to point to a trailer with ramps to tell me how he needed to fix his own trailer with ramps. I looked to the far left lane, the high-speed lane, and saw a red truck pass by with an elephant laying down in the back. Its trunk stuck out over the tailgate. True, it was not a real live elephant. It was a bit of a misshapen elephant suited for a miniature golf course. But still, I saw an elephant riding in the back of a little red truck on I-270. If only I had been able to snap a picture.Now I have two mysteries to try to solve. The elephant, and how that Grabber recognized me."}, {"title": "An Enigma Wrapped in a Conundrum, Encased in a Quandary, and Carried in a Paradox", "date": "Wednesday, June 25, 2014", "text": "Hick took today off work to haul me to the doctor. No city driving for this ol' Val. Good thing I checked out the directions at the last minute. More than five people had told me my appointment was at MoBap, in a professional building. I guess the amateur building was eagerly awaiting for some calamity to befall the professional building, so that he could take over the duties, like a first runner-up in a beauty pageant, or like an understudy for Bette Midler in a Broadway performance of Rochelle, Rochelle in the event that a Humpty Dumpty with a melon head bowled her over while she was catching for her softball team in the Show League.Huh. My appointment was NOT at a MoBap professional building, but on down the road a piece in a stand-alone facility. Hick had his Garmin, the generic version, which performed admirably at finding the address. I wish I could compliment Hick on his driving skills, but this is one area where he does not excel. Okay, I got there an back alive. That's the good news. The bad news is that I had a bit of a rough trip.Hick's sweaving skills were in rare form today. He's a Master Sweaver. Hick is the sweavingest sweaver who ever sweaved. Any other travelers on the roadway might have looked into T-Hoe's passenger window and assumed that Hick was transporting a cobra being enticed out of a wicker basket on the front seat by a pungi played by a charmer on the back seat, so rubbery were my head and neck from all the sweaving.Hick also has never met a speed limit he cared to obey. That's fine on the interstate, because the other drivers and Hick are simpatico, but on the blacktop roads, he really needs to slow down a bit. Those roads are rough and crumbly, with a plethora of potholes. I was jarred so hard that the straps of my over-the-shoulder-boulder-holder slid right off my shoulders. My boulders themselves jounced like big rocks on that very first shake table those crooked Hoffman people used in the first season of Gold Rush.Still, Hick got me to the appointment on time. A little early, even. And as Val Thevictorian's luck would have it, after the exam, she was shipped over to MoBap itself for another test. Hick piloted me there without incident and waited for me to be sprung. He even dropped me off at the door. Unfortunately, our day took way more time than either of us had anticipated. The sweet pregnant lady doing my test even offered me a snack. I declined, but had to chug down the bottle of water she gave me. For the test. Then she came right back for the plastic bottle. \"We recycle these, you know.\" Another mark in the plus column for MoBap. I am having quite a time trying to find something to complain about with them.Instead of stopping for a leisurely lunch at 2:30 on our way home, Hick elected to drive through Captain D's. Too bad it missed my menu review yesterday. Hick had a pressing engagement to haul home and unload and stack for the winter 100 bales of hay.Here's the thing about our lunch. Hick went through the drive-thru, and ordered two fish sandwiches. We waited. And waited. \"Huh. It might have been faster to go somewhere for a sit-down meal.\" Uh huh. I had my heart set on some Imo's Velveeta on cardboard, which was only feet way, but that darn minion of Captain D came to the window with our order. As the official passenger-seat food-hander-outer, I was struck by the redundancies in the wrapping.I looked in the plastic bag for our sandwiches, only to find one of those flip-top styrofoam trays. I opened it. Inside were two foil logs. I opened one up, and found white waxed paper with the Captain D's logo on it wrapped around a fish sandwich. Are you with me here? Let's go backwards, from the way they wrapped it. Fish sandwich wrapped in 1) waxed paper. Waxed paper wrapped in 2) foil. Foil put in 3) styrofoam box. Styrofoam box put in 4) plastic bag.I'll bet that snake charmer could have slapped a hunk of fish on a slab of roti and handed it to us with no wrapping, all while tooting at that cobra.

No matter what time of day, or what kind of weather I purchase my Monsoon...it is runny. Runny like Campbell's Chunky Soup. I might as well order a shake, because the shake would be thicker than my Monsoon. I used to think the workers made it as soon as I ordered, and let it sit on the counter until I pulled up to the drive-thru window. Nope. The last one I saw created right before my eyes. And it was still runny. My best old ex-teaching buddy Mabel says I should ask them to turn it upside down at the counter. That's how they advertise the Monsoons. The cardboard cup even has a picture of the Monsoon upside down. Doesn't matter if it's a mini or a small, all Monsoons are runny. Don't take the spoon, ask for a straw.Hardee's CheeseburgerNot so much a cheeseburger as a large seeded bun sandwiching twin lakes of ketchup and mustard, with pickle chips the size of York Peppermint Patties. Somewhere, there's a wafer of charbroiled meatness, but it's hard to find. The hint of cheese is easily confused with the mustard.Hardee's Hand-Breaded Chicken TendersElongated chicken nuggets fried up in peanut oil with batter crispy enough to break a tooth. The term breading is used loosely, as no bread is evident, only oily hard flour leavings.Taco Bell Supreme Beef BurritoA quilt-sized flour tortilla folded like the maker was taking a stab at the old \"You Can't Fold A Piece Of Paper In Half More Than Seven Times\" challenge. Once you have gnawed your way through one end, you might find the dollop of sour cream and shreds of lettuce with a light coating of red sauce interspersed with several cubes of diced tomato and a couple slivers of cheese. After that bite, you'll get into the burrito proper for two bites of bean paste and intermittent crumbs of a meatish product touted by one of my school lunch companions (who teaches nutrition) to be worm protein.Ponderosa/Bonanza SteakhouseYou can order a variety of steaks, but don't ask for a chopped steak any other way than well done. They won't make it rare because they're afraid of spreading E. Coli or Mad Cow Disease.

Topped with a tiny bit of sauce and tasteless cheese.Pizza Hut PizzaNondescript crust covered with a lake of salty sauce and a miniscule amount of cheese, sprinkled with two or three pieces of each topping.Imo's PizzaBest described by a work colleague as \"Velveeta on cardboard.\" I must say, I'm all for Velveeta on cardboard if it tastes like Imo's. I'm a fan of the square beyond compare.If that's not enough to encourage you to heat up your own food in the oven, or warm it in the microwave at home, I don't know what is.Feel free to review your own restaurant non-favorites in the comments."}, {"title": "Time To Make More Room on the Counter of My Proposed Handbasket Factory", "date": "Monday, June 23, 2014", "text": "Eureka!

The devil part, maybe. He has less of a knack for words than Norm Crosby. No Nipsey Russell is our Hick. But he could be all the rage for guys like himself. Guys who know what they want to say, but simply cannot find their sentiments on a greeting card.A couple of Hick's gems I still remember from when we were first married.\"You are like an elephant.\" So sweet, my special guy, my new husband. When I called him on it, Hick became defensive. \"I didn't mean it bad. I meant...like...you never forget anything! You are like an elephant.\" Okay. No need to repeat it. Can't you see the card with this Hickism? A drawing of a healthy elephant on the front, perhaps adorned with false eyelashes, perhaps with a pink bow. YOU ARE LIKE AN ELEPHANT. And on the inside: You never forget anything! Such a compliment. Any gal would be pleased to receive such a card from her guy. Right?\"I like that skirt. It reminds me of a circus tent.\" Uh huh. So complimentary on my wardrobe. He couldn't believe I was offended. \"No! I didn't mean it like that. I didn't mean it's the SIZE of a circus tent. It's the colors. It's bright. I makes me think of a circus tent.\" Oh, how romantic this card could be. On the front, a colorful circus tent. Above it, YOUR SKIRT REMINDS ME OF A CIRCUS TENT. And on the inside: I can't wait to see what's under the Big Top! Yep. You know that's what's on every guy's mind. Why not just put it out there? No need to beat around the bush.Yesterday morning, I had this major breakthrough concerning Hick's new proposed greeting card line. He had gone through a litany of complaints/suggestions for how I should behave. Not that he's controlling or anything. He just wants me to go to bed at 8:00 when he does, and get up at 5:00 when he does, and go to flea markets and auctions, and go down to his cabin, and walk around looking at his goats and chickens. You know. Everything he does. He summed it up quite well when he said, \"I just want you to be me.\"Huh! Aint' THAT the truth!\"Obviously. You want me to be you. That's the problem.\"\"No, no...that's not what I meant. I want you to be WITH me. That's what I should have said.\"\"But the other part is what it boils down to. You don't care about MY interests, but I should take on all of yours. Indeed. You DO want me to BE you.\"That's the third card. On the front, just those words. I WANT YOU TO BE ME. And when you open it up, it's a picture of the guy with his face cut out, and a little silver mirror so the gal sees her face with his hair and hat and shirt, etc.Yes. Hick's greeting card line would be called Hickmark. Besides those three, the others are a bit more racy. His attempts at wooing a woman with sweet nothings. Let's just say Hick gets right to the point. We cannot mention the verses in these other cards. The romantic line would be 47 Shades of Tan. Cards would be on paper sack material. Or perhaps original (or even used) white butcher paper, because they could smell like meat. Hey! Guys are the ones buying them, remember? Instead of envelopes, the cards would be closed with a knotted piece of twine that comes off hay bales when you're ready to feed the hay to your goats or minipony.It could work.

He's not doing it for the money. It pays a stipend of $100 for the entire session. Which, if you are mathematically inclined, figures out to less than ten dollars a day. Sure, he had a free shared room, and delicious meals from the cafeteria that also fed the Boys State citizenss, but he had to pay his own way there and back.

He says it is a one-time award of $1500. Not too shabby! I was telling my best old ex-teaching buddy, Mabel, by text last evening, that I imagine it's more difficult for a staffer in the IT department to win, what with being behind the scenes and not out front like the counselors. Genius confirmed later that he is the FIRST IT staffer ever to win the Staff Scholarship. Kudos to my little techy. His photo is HERE, on this page, without our Thevictorian surname, and not in order of where he is standing. Let's just say he is proudly sporting his staff shirt, ID badge, and white shorts.I told Mabel that Genius was now back at \"home\" in the city, doing laundry and probably fighting with his landlord's dog over the last slice of Totino's Pizza. Mabel summed it all up with: \"Dog 1, Genius 0.\" Genius was shocked at her blatant pronouncement, though he was pleased with her congratulations for a job well done. Genius also said our county has been well-represented by the staffers, what with his cross-county rival winning the Staff Scholarship last year while acting as a counselor.A few miles away, The Pony has been attending Missouri Scholars Academy on the Mizzou campus. Today was Family Day. Hick, and The Pony's niece, who is only a two years younger than The Pony, went to visit. I stayed home to avoid a possible exsanguination at the hands of Hick at the wheel for a three-hour drive. Hick reported that he took The Pony to a local park, where they toured some caves, and then went out for pizza. They attended programs at 1:00 and 3:00. At 4:00, Hick called to say he was leaving, and that he thought The Pony was ready for them to go. He informed me, upon interrogation, that The Pony seemed to be getting along swimmingly with other Scholars, and that several had called his name to greet him at the park. He's a regular Cheers Norm, our little Pony. Hick also said that The Pony mentioned that he had formed actual friendships with about 15 people while he has been at the Academy. Unless you know The Pony, you may not grasp the significance of this interpersonal interaction.Oh, and one more thing...The Pony has spent the last week keeping company with...wait for it...drumroll please...are you ready for this...A GIRL! He has even forgotten to call me many nights because, as he put it, \"I was talking to a girl, and that distracted me, and then we had our house meeting, and then I had my shower, and now it is time for lights out in five minutes.\" That's his story, and he's stickin' to it.WAIT! That's not what I'm bragging about. Hick said the 3:00 program was a scholar bowl competition, and that The Pony's house was competing in the finals, and that THEY WON! Yeah. Out of 19 houses. Braggin' rights to The Pony for being on the smartest team at smart camp. HooRah! Never mind that he didn't answer any questions during the final competition. He had to do something right to get on the team for all the preliminary rounds. As he told Hick, \"That kid from our rival school who competes against me at our school scholar bowl is smart, and I am smart, but up here, we're nothing special.\" Oh, yes he is! He's very special to me. We had that talk before he left that he's not always going to be the best. I think he's handling it well. The Pony has come out of his shell. No pictures of The Pony, but if you have high-speed internet, you can find him on this page, in a red shirt and plaid shorts, playing conga drums and \"dancing.\"Whew!

It's in a direct line with thehallway leading down to the check-in windows of several doctors. I did not wantpeople traipsing past my tootsies, breathing their germ-laden breath in myface. I figured that if I sat on the opposite wall, surely people would bewalking past those other chairs, evening out their path to the middle of thehall, giving me my desired personal space. You know what happens when wefigure. We make a fig out of u and re. Wait. I might havethat saying messed up a little bit.Yeah. I was all the way across that five-to-six-foot gap, but the sick folk still insisted on crowding me. I was forever pulling back my feet. I looked like a Cossack dancer, but without the colorful costume. Nothing would do those close-walkers but to brush past my legs and feet like a cat waiting for his bowl of Fancy Feast. They were closer than the bumpers of Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Jeff Gordon drafting during the final lap of the Daytona 500. Closer than Russell Hantz to Survivor's Hidden Immunity Idols. Closer than Marlon Brando to Maria Schneider in Last Tango in Paris. Okay, not THAT close. But they could not stay away from Val.No matter whether the walkers were pushing loved ones in wheelchairs, hauling oxygen tanks, or flying solo, they still came within millimeters of my withdrawn New Balance. One lady was pulling her teenage daughter by a clear length of oxygen tubing, yanking on it like she was a recalcitrant canine resisting the leash, saying, \"Come ON.\" And still they trod treacherously close to Val's toes.I wish I had thrust that shortbread rabbit/koala bear at them like a talisman. \"Beware! BEWARE!\" I think those close-walkers would have heeded my warning.

She's perfectly capable of driving herself, but she was having a biopsy of a little growth in front of her ear, and I didn't want her driving in case she felt woozy.Last week, when she went in to ask the doctor about the growth, a new nurse took her in. \"She was really young. She treated me different from Chatty, the regular nurse, who never stops talking. I take her peppermints. She LOVES peppermints. Anyway, this new girl was taking my information. She asked if I still lived at the same address. Then she says, 'Who's with you?' and I told her nobody. And she said, 'You drove yourself ALL THE WAY OVER HERE BY YOURSELF?' And I said, 'Yes. I'm perfectly capable of driving myself. I do it all the time.' THEN she said, 'Do you eat your vegetables?' I don't know what she thought was wrong with me.\"\"I told you they treat older people differently. When I took you for surgery that time, they kept talking to ME, like you weren't even in the room. And I told them, 'I don't know. Ask HER.' Remember that?\"\"I do remember that.\"\"And you were barely 70 then. I don't know what's wrong with people. They need to have more respect.\"So, I drove Mom to the doctor. She refused to be let out at the door, though if it had been still raining when we arrived, she had said she might get out at the door. We walked in, despite a delivery truck blocking the concrete sidewalk ramps so I had to step up and down. Inside, there was some grand rummage sale of scrubs and health care uniforms in the lobby. There must have been 10 racks clogging the area where chairs usually sit.We wove our way to the two elevators, and two men jumped out of the racks and beat us to the button. \"We'll just wait for the next one, Mom, if that's okay with you.\" I don't like to ride with people if I can get a private elevator car to myself. Mom said that was fine. We pushed the button. Both elevators were on the top floor: 4. Yeah. What did you expect, a high-rise?The elevator on the left came down and opened up. Nobody was inside. We stepped in and I pushed 4. That's when it happened. The stampede of a migration of childebeests. FOUR adults and THREE children crammed in after us. I call shenanigans! Where were they while we were waiting? They must have been crouched in the clothing racks like lions around a watering hole. Did they all go to the 4th floor with us? Nope. One adult got off on 2. Two adults got off on 3. And the last adult and two kids got off on 4 with us. I swear. That elevator was like a clown car.But that's not the most exciting thing that happened to us at the doctor today. Nope. Nothing odd about rude elevator usurpers. It was after Mom signed in, while she was waiting to be called, that weirdness visited us. I chose a row of three chairs against the wall, way down the hall, where people wouldn't bother me. As much. Mom came all the way back. \"I'll just wait down here away from everybody until they call me.\"I had chosen the middle of the three seats to discourage those weirdos who want to sit by me when there are 30 other empty chairs around the room. \"Here, Mom. I'll move over one.\"\"Oh, no. That's fine. I'll sit over here.\" She moved to my right.\"No. That's farther away. Let me move my purse. Sit here on my left, where you're closer when they call you.\"\"Well...I don't know if I want to sit there. There's something on the chair.\"Indeed. There WAS something on the chair. Something I had not noticed. \"What IS that?\" Let the record show that I was not wearing my glasses. \"It looks like...cat vomit? I don't know...a cookie? Is it part of a cookie?\"Mom leaned over. Almost put her nose on it. \"Oh! It's a rabbit!\"Looks more like a koala bear to me. But who am I to contradict my mother?

Or at least until she decides to give up her high-speed internet that The Pony enjoys so much.Wednesday morning Mom told me all about it. \"You know how I said the cable people were out front yesterday, with their lift truck, working on the pole in front of my house? And how the AT&T truck showed up a couple hours later at the same pole?\"\"Yeah. You told me about it when you called that afternoon, and my phone showed your call as out of area.

I didn't know they worked that late. And why would he be there to switch your phone? It was already switched. That's why my caller ID showed it different.\"\"I don't know why he was there that late. But I got to talking to him, and he said he went to school where I used to teach! But I didn't remember him. And he didn't remember me. He said his wife went there, too.

How do you know he wasn't just some guy telling you that to get in your house?\"\"Well, he had a big truck. It was parked in the driveway.\"\"A big truck doesn't mean he works for AT&T!\"\"It was a big WHITE truck. With AT&T on the side.\"\"Still. He might have knocked the real AT&T driver in the head! And then taken the truck. Haven't you seen the original Halloween? Michael Myers stole that guy's uniform and his tow truck! The AT&T guy should have had ID.

Have you heard? There's a new program from the Missouri Department of Conservation designed to get more people a-fishin'! It's called the Discover Nature Fishing Rod and Reel Loaner Program. Yes. LOANER. You can check out equipment FROM DESIGNATED LIBRARIES and try your hand at fishing without investing in fishing accoutrements. Not too fast, there. You still must have a fishing license if you're over the age of 14. Which opens up the proverbial and literal can of worms from Val Thevictorian's perspective.If you already have a fishing license, you probably have your own fishing equipment. Oh, and you have to have a library card to check out the loaners. I'm not complaining. Let there be a licensed, library-card-holding, borrowed-equipment fishing frenzy! I'm not casting stones. Not trying to make a ripple. It makes me no nevermind. I just think there are a few kinks that need to be ironed out.The fishing equipment includes up to 12 poles per library, each with a little tackle box containing hooks, sinkers, bobbers, rubber worms, and a stringer. Apparently, the librarians are in charge of this equipment. One article said that the librarians will put a marshmallow on each hook so that nobody is snagged in the handling of the pole. That's fine for a brand-new fishing pole and hook. But think about when people check in their equipment after a day of fishing. There might be worm guts on the hooks if they sprung for their own bait after buying a license and a library card. At the very least, there's going to be smelly moss and weed particles clinging to the line, and fish odor on the stringers. And what about those reels that get jammed tighter than the dickens with twisted line? Do the librarians really want to deal with this stuff? To smell those used poles waiting to be checked out again?I don't know about your librarians, but the ones at my local library are mostly volunteers. Crotchety, dessicated, stern volunteers, who refuse to deviate from established policy, and would like nothing better than to sit amongst the books, stroking them, perhaps, while whispering sweet nothings between their pages, while ignoring patrons as long as possible. I can't imagine these would-be Cerberuses flinging wide their gates to allow common folks to traipse about with sharp hooks (encased in marshmallows) swinging from long rods, perhaps with an unpleasant odor attached. I cannot see them spiffing up those fishing poles to await borrowing by the next patron. Nor can I see the head librarian taking on these duties. Neither do I imagine the Missouri Department of Conservation will assign a paid or volunteer representative to be on the premises daily to deal with their rods.What about this pole-loaning program?

I am not sure what occasion these efforts mark. We don't have a festival coming up. I doubt it's to impress the press which will be convening at the prison. Apparently we are about to lethally inject another convicted ne'er-do-well, because the sawhorses and orange tape that mark the press area have been in place since yesterday.The thoroughfares of Backroads have not had this much attention lavished upon them since that headless body was found in the septic tank, and (unrelatedly) the cardboard-boxed portable meth lab was abandoned along the gravel road.On my way to town this morning, I encountered a truck with a man-basket parked on the blacktop county road, another truck with a woodchipper parked behind it. It looked like they had recently felled a tree, because four sections of trunk were laying in the underbrush across the road. I suppose they were too big or too heavy to chip.In a nearby town, crews had a road blocked off between the mini post office and the old library/city hall, painting thick white stopping lines by the stop signs, and also rectangular parking spaces along the road.On the road to my mom's house, MEN WORKING signs were in place for the gray-pantsed, white-t-shirted prisoners weedeating along the right of ways. Thank goodness we have three prisons in the area to meet our landscaping needs. They are not allowed mowers. I suppose they could make a low-speed getaway like a Humpty-Dumpty-with-a-melon-head kind of guy on a Rascal. The only time they get mowers is on the prison grounds proper, when they gang-mow in a\u00a0 wedge like geese in migration. Yesterday, though, a regular civilian was mowing the grounds all by his lonesome. Again, probably due to the upcoming injection. Because the chopper/chipper combo was blocking half the road, without even the courtesy of a flagman to watch for oncoming traffic, I chose an alternate route home. Wouldn't you know it, I got behind a yellow highway department tractor with a mower that extends off to the side on a stalk. You know. It mows those slanted ditch embankments, and sometimes tree branches.I swear. The Backroads foliage is being trimmed closer than a pr0n performer's privates.

She's been out of the loop, what with my recent hospitalization. Did I mention that here? Feel free to ask in case I didn't. Two weeks without tabloids, and her neighbors are calling to see what's going on. These are the neighbors she likes. The Czech and his wife, the ones she makes Check Mix for.I also wanted to show Mom pictures of The Pony that I found on the Missouri Scholars Academy website. He looks like he's having a rousing good time. Mom's favorites are the pictures of The Pony at the African Music and Dance presentation. Yes! The Pony is right in the thick of it, dancing away. And playing conga drums! Such a departure for our reserved Pony. I downloaded the photos and put them in Mom's picture file. They were the very first photos on her computer. Shocker, there. Then I showed her how to get to them in two clicks. I think she can do it.While we were scanning several hundred pictures for a glimpse of The Pony, finding 17, which is pretty good, I think...I noticed a tab at the bottom that said Mom's computer was in grave danger from a security issue. Something like that. The thing she called the number from last week, and talked to a lady for 30 minutes, and pushed whatever computer buttons that lady told her to. \"Look, Mom. This is a scam. You don't need to call that number. Close it. See? See how easy that was? Don't call them! Close it.\" Mom agreed. But I know how she is.Mom wanted to print several of The Pony's pictures. I figured out how to download them and print. Mom has a color printer. I used to, but Genius replaced it with a non-colored laser printer. We laid a trio of Ponys on the table to dry. I leaned back from the computer, my hands clasped behind my head. Mom had been sitting shotgun on my right. She was up and down several times, peering at the screen with and without her bifocals. I was tired of sitting.Mom stood up and reached for the shelf above her monitor. I assumed she was stretching, or getting a pen to write down instructions on how to find those pictures again. You know what happens when we assume. Mom grabbed a big tube of Bath and Body Works Vanilla Bean Noel Hand Lotion.My sister the ex-mayor's wife gives it to us for Christmas every year. I love it. It lasts a long time. And it smells SO good, even though I'm not usually a fan of vanilla. Back in the day, when Genius used to ride to school with us, and I put on my lotion every morning, he would say, \"Mmm. You smell like a cookie!\" Which is one of the nicer things Genius ever said to me.Mom was headed for a doctor's appointment later in the day, so I assumed she was lathering up to be presentable. You know what happens when we assume. Mom unscrewed the cap while I peered through her computer desk towards her TV with its newly-acquired DISH network. Before I knew it, MOM WAS SLATHERING VANILLA BEAN NOEL ALL OVER MY RIGHT ELBOW! That's a bit forward if you ask me. Even for a mom lotioning up her daughter.\"What are you doing?\"\"Oh, do you mind? I just thought your elbow looked a little scaly, so I'm putting lotion on it for you. Is your other elbow dry?\"\"No, Mom. My left elbow is totally smooth and moisturized.\"\"Okay.\" She started putting the lid back on the tube of lotion. Apparently, sarcasm is not well-detected by the newly-octogenarianated.\"Of course my left elbow is dry, too! Put some on it so they'll match!\" I swiveled my left elbow to give her access. Which was entirely too much like exercise. \"I can't believe you started putting lotion on my elbow without asking me!\"\"Well, I didn't think you'd mind. I was only trying to help.\"\"Now you're making me think of Genius, at Grandpa's funeral, when the Ex-Mayor was still mayor, and had his arm resting along the back of the pew at the funeral home. Genius rubbed the Ex-Mayor's elbow, and said, 'Your elbow is crusty.' That got the whole row laughing. I can't believe the liberties you take with me!\"\"Don't get me laughing. I'll choke.\"\"We wouldn't want that. What are you, drunk?\"\"Oh, stop it! When you called this morning, I had just come up from turning off lights in the basement. I was hoping you wouldn't call, because then you would accuse me of drinking that bottle I'm going to give Hick. Then I ran out to the garage for a minute, and you called as soon as I got back in the house. That's why it took me four rings to answer.\"\"Do you have a bottle out in the garage, too?\"\"No! Now stop it. There. Your elbow is smooth.\"\"Then put that lotion back and sit down.\"Seriously. Who does that? I hope she's not like one of those hat-pin people who walk through crowds and poke their fellow pedestrians. Mom has always said she loves to watch people.

He even cooked one for me, too! What a guy! As he carried them into the kitchen on a stack of three paper plates (we are not exactly Chinet people, so it takes more than one plate to contain the juices), he declared, \"That was the best sixty dollars I ever spent.\" He was referring, of course, to Gassy G, the gas grill he bought at the auction. I must say, Gassy G has performed stellarly in all of Hick's endeavors. That little dent on the front does not seem to differently-able Gassy G in any way.Because the steaks were fairly Flintstone-brontosaurus-sized ribeyes from Save A Lot, Hick did not want much in the way of side dishes. He's quite the carnivore, you know. I offered a potato dish, or a baked potato. It's not like tossing one in the microwave and pushing the timer would wear me out. But Hick said no, that the salad I had mentioned would be fine. So he had a big salad of hearts of romaine, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, and shredded sharp cheddar. I had originally thought about sauteing him some mushrooms and onions, but that seemed a bit out of my league, what with looking up the definition of saute, and dragging a pan out from that drawer under the stove, and raising the temperature of food in a way other than heating it in the microwave or warming it in the oven.If you don't hear from me again, it could be due to the ingredient I added to my salad. I left off the tomato, and sprinkled on some sunflower seeds. The thing is, I found that bag of sunflower seeds in my small pantry beside Frig, and the bag was unopened, so I figured it was fairly new, even though I couldn't remember the last time I bought sunflower seeds, so I looked at the date, and it said, \"Best by 06 10 10.\" Which is not really fresh. But they WERE unopened. So I cut open the bag and tasted a few, and I didn't keel over, so I added them to my salad. They were quite tasty. I can't imagine how I could have stood the pleasure if I had used them before 06 10 10.This shall never be mentioned in the presence of my mother, who once served me four-year-old ranch dressing on Thanksgiving."}, {"title": "Basement Alcohol is the New Wedding Invitation Envelope Cheap Glue", "date": "Saturday, June 14, 2014", "text": "I feel like a prized cow.

Today the wildlife was out in full force.As I started to town, just down the gravel road, at the second neighbor, a deer stood in the gravel road. Doe. A deer. A female deer. She looked me right in the eye, but not in a playing-chicken kind of way, then looked over her shoulder behind her. She bounded off into the woods on the right. Well. Being a country gal, I know what that look means: more deer to follow. I crept along, watching the underbrush between the gravel road and the woods on the left. There it was! A fawn scrabbled across the road mere feet in front of me. It looked neither left nor right, but was intent on a reunion with its momma. It was not a new-born fawn, all leggy and wobbly, but a sturdier one, still with white spots. My mom had seen this pair a couple weeks ago when she was sitting with me during my early convalescence. Oh! Did I mention I was in the hospital at the end of May?I made a trip to the bank, then dropped by my mom's house to school her on her new DISH remote. The serviceman got her all hooked up to DISH, so she's packing in the cable boxes tomorrow. Not letting any grass grow under her feet, or those cable boxes. Mom doesn't count as wildlife. Yet. But when I came out of her house, I saw that T-Hoe's black hood was covered with tiny white flower petals. Mom has a flowering tree right beside the driveway, but those flowers are bigger. I looked around, but did not see where these tiny white petals were coming from. I hopped in and tried to disengage myself from conversation with Mom. As I backed up the driveway, a couple of those tiny white flower petals blew in my open window. WAIT! They were BUGS! Bugs with long oval white wings! I jammed my finger on the window-raising lever forthwith! Those buggy things on T-Hoe's hood held on for a quarter-mile on blacktop. I hope I did not bring home an infestation.Hick reported last night, after dark, when of course I could not go look, that we had acquired 12 or 14 new chicks overnight. Uh huh. Chickens are sneaky like that.

Since they were already out, parading around with their two moms (not that there's anything wrong with that), Hick did not think he could catch them all. He did snap a picture this evening, though.Next time I will demand that Hick crawl towards them on his belly like a serpent, in order to get a better photo. If you count, I think there are 13. Not sure. Some of them are doubled up with a buddy of the same hue. And Hick said some of them kept getting under the moms.

She canceled her cable service yesterday. I was in shock. She hadn't mentioned her obvious vendetta against that company since she was all up in arms about their new one box/one TV policy, in which they required EVERYBODY to update their receivers, and to pay an additional monthly fee of five dollars per converter box. Even though many people did not want the upgrade.I might have related how one of my co-workers said her husband went to the cable office to get the boxes, and saw an armed guard in the lobby. And how the clerk told him that since he had been polite, he could have his for half price. That's no way to run a business. Either you can afford to give everybody a break, or you require everybody to pay the full amount. Pardon my barnyard linguistics, but that's horsepoo.So, out of the blue yesterday, my mom left me a message. \"I've gone to town to stop my cable service. Be back later in case you're trying to reach me.\" Huh. So unlike Mom, to do something without discussing it for several hundred hours first. AND...the Cardinals were playing at 6:00 p.m. Surely Mom would not cancel her cable and go without TV until she found another provider!I gave her time to complete her mission, and rang her up. \"Mom! What's going on? You haven't talked about this cable thing for a while. Did something happen?\"\"No. It's been bothering me for a while. Yesterday, I called and got AT & T back as my phone service. Then I called DISH Network and they're coming out Thursday morning to install a dish and get me all set up. I'm still keeping that high-speed cable internet for The Pony, because he enjoys it so much. But I'm just tired of the way that cable company treats people. I don't care if I don't save ANY money, I will be happier like this.\"\"But...don't the Cardinals play tonight? You'll be without TV!\"\"No I won't. I am paid with cable through the 18th. So I will have everything ready to switch over when my cable is disconnected. I still have it now to watch the Cardinals. After I went over to the cable office and told them what I wanted, a lady called me. She wanted to know why I was cancelling my service. I told her I did not like having to pay that extra five dollars per TV. I said it was just too much now that they'd increased their rates also. I said, 'I didn't mind too much paying up to $150 a month. But now it's $179, and I won't pay that.' And do you know what she said? She said, 'Well, we can reduce your phone bill to $19.99, and that will give you a monthly bill of $143. Let's do that, and you can keep our service.' And I told her no. Why didn't they offer me that in the beginning when I complained about the boxes? I'm not playing around with them any more. I don't care if my bill is higher now. I'm done with them.\"\"I know what you mean. Either they can afford to have lower rates or they can't. That's bull, giving some people cheaper bills. Hey! You may be the only person who was actually paying the full amount! Maybe everyone else complained and got theirs lowered.\"\"That may be. But I'm done with them! Except for the internet. For The Pony.\"\"He will be happy that you thought of him. I hope you like DISH. I'll help you with the remote, until you learn how to use it.\"\"That would be great. They're coming between 8:00 and noon on Thursday. I'll let you know what they say about switching over on the 18th.\"\"Yeah. Genius is gone. The Pony is gone. I guess Hick can help you out when he comes to mow your yard. Show you what you have to take back to the cable office.\"\"I feel so good now that I finally got rid of the cable.\"Yep. My mom. She'll gladly pay more to teach that cable company a lesson. I'm about ready to do the same thing with SPRINT concerning my internet.Like mother, like daughter. We are two peas in a pod.

Who would ever have expected Hot Pockets to be hot? Sure, you don't eat them cold. Any fool knows to heat them in the microwave (preferably one with an original door handle and not two round drawer handles), or warm them in an oven (preferably one with an upper AND a lower heating element). Yeah. That's where the name comes from, isn't it? You increase the temperature of that frozen treat until, in comparison to its frozen state, it's hot. And inside that crispy crust, there's a pocket of goo with flavor (in my case the Philly Cheese Steak edition) that gives it the other part of its name. Hot. Pocket.Oh, dear. I have been spending time alone during the day, what with Hick doing an honest day's work, Genius doing all his work quickly and efficiently and then being used as a picture-hanger or other menial-task-master to justify his salary, and The Pony being away at Missouri Scholars Academy with his people, as he calls his fellow 327 nerds, getting smarter by the hour. Because I am responsible for nobody's lunch but my own, I have not been whipping up seven-course gourmet spreads suitable for the cover of Seven-Course Gourmet Spreads Monthly. I know that may come as a surprise to a few of you. My lunches have been consisting of, perhaps, a cold hot dog with a side of red grapes. A hunk of extra-sharp cheddar and an individual bag of Combos, with fresh strawberries. Or a Hot Pocket with celery stalks and Hidden Valley Ranch dip.If you ask me, Hot Pockets should be renamed to reflect their true character. Renamed as Molten Lava Squirting Tongue Incinerators. Uh huh. That's more descriptive. Lets people know what they're in for. So they can have a tub of ice ready to prevent their tongue from sizzling like a slab of tenderloin on a hot griddle. Or have a phone handy with 9-1-1 on speed dial. Or have Jackie Chiles on retainer.I am no simple-minded rube when it comes to food. Food and I go way back. I've been around the block a time or two with food. I know that when something comes out of the microwave or the oven, it needs to rest a bit. To let its molecules slow down. Dissipate that thermal energy into the atmosphere.I did not grab that Molten Lava Squirting Tongue Incinerator Hot Pocket right off the pizza pan covered with foil that I took out of the oven with a mitt and pop it right into my mouth. No sirree, Bob! I let it sit for five minutes while I gathered up a bubba cup of ice water and my mostly-ice 44 oz. Diet Coke, and carried them down to my dark basement lair. And then, because my little Pony is away, I had to make another trip up to the kitchen to get my lunch. I fiddled about, squirting some horseradish sauce into an old plastic garlic butter cup from Little Caesar's. No ramekins here in the Thevictorian household.Once I had all of my lunch items in place, I set to surfing the internet, broadening my horizons on all subjects but the blast-furnace temperature of Hot Pockets. It was a good twenty minutes after that Molten Lava Squirting Tongue Incinerator Hot Pocket came out of the oven until I took my first bite.

Please don't judge her. She's not looking her best. Her silky fur is not so silky, because in warm weather, she likes to lay in a dirt hollow she dug under where Hick parks his Gator. Of course, I could use her dull coat to frame her partner in crime, Ann, for eating eggs throughout the day. Wait! Did I say frame? What I meant to say was submit proof to Hick of Ann's clandestine activities. No egg-shiny coat for Miss Juno.Oh, and Juno does not like to pose. It took five pictures to get one that wasn't a blur of fur. She must have grown tired of not being petted, so she sat down for the sure head stroke. Yes, this is not a flattering photo. Juno is looking a bit...um...doggy. Showing off her canines, ears back and not inquisitively perked. Her silky tail full of dust, not sweeping back and forth in joy at our reunion.I must also point out that the bites taken out of Juno's doghouse roof are no doubt the work of Ann, the black german shepherd. Juno cannot be peckish enough to snack on asphalt shingles. After all, there are all those eggs handfuls of cat kibble that are dispensed as treats, and the best leftovers tossed out the kitchen door, and the giant pan of dog food every morning, and occasional dog biscuits from the auction. Juno is no goat. She takes care of her abode, even sweeping out the cedar chips onto the welcome mat by the kitchen door.You can still see her human-like eyes, though. At least one of them. I really must have her sit for a proper picture one of these days.Maybe I can bring her into the house while Hick is at work, and have her lay down on his side of the bed.

It's more of a written analysis of what currently makes Genius tick. Even though he has a real adult job this summer, working for $20 an hour at an electrical engineering firm, he still has that starving-college-student mentality.Genius called me Friday to say that he was considering chucking it all and starting his own think tank. WAIT! That was Moira Kelly to D.B. Sweeney in The Cutting Edge, and she was kind of making fun of his dumbness. What I meant to say was that Genius decided he might as well forget about college and gainful employment, and take pictures for a living. He had just networked a gig to take wedding pictures for a four-hour stint at $50 per hour.Genius is not some casual cell-phone-photo snapper. He develops his own film and has many exotic lenses and knows his way around an f-stop. He is also not averse to making some quick cash off this learned talent. Hick has standing orders to buy up cameras he finds at flea markets and auctions. Genius then resells them online for pocket money. Hey! At least he's not selling his plasma for beer money. Thursday night, Hick found an auction camera with two lenses, and texted Genius to see what he should spend. Genius told him to go up to $40, because more would cut too deeply into his profit margin. Crafty Hick got it for $25. He had also bought another camera earlier in the week for $10.Saturday, Genius had plans to swing by the old homestead after a Friday night trip to his college town to work on the solar car, to pick up clothes he needs for his job as an IT staffer at Missouri Boys State this week, and before his wedding photo shoot.\"I won't have much time. Make sure you tell Dad to lay out a five-dollar bill. I owe him $35, but I only have two twenties.\" Indeed. Wouldn't want Daddy Dearest to make an extra five dollars for his trouble. Hick really needs to negotiate a finder's fee.The Pony and I were in the midst of a three-hour packing extravaganza when Genius arrived. The Pony was heading off for the Missouri Scholars Academy for three weeks. A sojourn which would require LAUNDRY before he returned. On last week's trip to Walmart, I sent The Pony to the back aisle for some Tide Pods. I don't use them myself. Imagine my consternation when I reached into the bag of 31 that The Pony had picked up, and found them to be the consistency of a human eyeball. Not that I am in the habit of plucking human eyeballs out of a plastic bag, of course. I put four in a ziplock bag for The Pony to take with him, and set the rest on the mantle of the fake electric fireplace that Hick was all gung-ho about buying after the Great Icepocalypse of Ought Six.\"Hey. Trade me two dollars for this.\" Genius held eight quarters in his fist. \"That's what HE gave me in change for my cameras. Three ones, and eight quarters. I don't need these quarters. Or, you can take the ones, too, and give me a five.\"\"I'll do it. But you have to take the eight quarters out to the garage and put them in my change cup in T-Hoe.\"\"Oh, all right. As long as I get a five.\" Genius circled the living room, his plan to plop on the long couch or the short couch foiled by The Pony's Academy accoutrements. \"Look, Genius. Tide Pods. How much does something like that cost?\" I had no idea. I'm not the type to go over my receipts with a fine-tooth comb. Two of which we bought for The Pony's trip. I figure there were probably smaller packages of Tide Pods, but The Pony is not a comparison shopper.\"Huh. Thirty-one pods. I'd say about twelve dollars.\" Genius put the bag back on the mantle. Gave it a double-take. Said no more.\"It's a pity those pods will go to waste. I don't use Tide Pods. I use the powder.\"\"Why is there a package of ALL Pods on the kitchen counter?\"\"Oh, your dad bought those at the auction. Said he thought The Pony could take them. But I said no. I don't want him having an allergic reaction to new detergent while he's away for three weeks. My mom switched detergents when I was in high school, and it took me two weeks to figure out that rash under my athletic socks was caused by All Tempa Cheer.\"\"Huh.\"\"Yes, it's too bad those Tide Pods are going to go to waste.\"\"I use Tide Pods. But I'm not paying you twelve dollars for thirty-one of them.\"\"Um. There are only twenty-seven left. Besides, did I ASK you for money?\"\"No, you did not.\"\"My point is, I'm not going to use them. So if you want them, you can take them.\"\"I'll take them. Ocean Mist. I use Alpine Breeze. I guess Ocean Mist will go okay with my Spring Fresh dryer sheets.\"\"I'm sure it will be fine. Take them. For free. You can have the ALL Pods, too.\"\"Okay. Thanks.\"Genius only had time to grab the big red wheeled suitcase that The Pony had planned to take, jump in the shower for forty minutes, and command The Pony to carry out the stuff Genius needed for Boys State. He told The Pony that if there was anything else I planned to give him, I needed to lay it out on the counter, because he was getting ready to leave. I made Genius walk into the kitchen. I withdrew two twenties from a stash my mom gives me every now and then \"to give the boys, when they have a special trip or something for school, so you don't have to come up with spending money for them.\"\"This is from your grandma.\"\"Aww...thanks.

I slick it down in the morning at the kitchen sink if it is unruly from being slept on wet after his nightly shower. At least he is potty-trained, and brushes his teeth, and knows how to apply antiperspirant. I've been harping at him that he must eat something each meal, even though chicken may not be served three times a day. I've told him to drink plenty of water. How to do his laundry by using Tide Pods. How to declare that he would like to dance, but alas, does not know how, because girls simply LOVE a project like that.Hick, on the other hand, gave him three pieces of advice. 1) A clip-on tie is good enough. Genius nearly had a conniption over this. He has a bit more sartorial flair. 2) Boys part their hair on the right side; girls part their hair on the left. I think I've mentioned this Hick Rule before. It drives me batty. And not just because I part my hair on the left. 3) Boys put on their belt by poking it through loops and sending it around the left side of their waist; girls put on their belt by poking it through loops and sending it around the right side of their waist. Seriously. Have you ever heard such a thing? I think belt looping depends on left- and right-handedness. Whichever way is easier to put that thing on and yank it back and put the lever through the holes. I know buttons are different for men and women. But that belt rule I've never heard of.Needless to say, The Pony is a bit confused. Not about his gender, but about these arbitrary hair and belt rules. He has a double crown, as his old daycare-lady-the-former-beautician used to say when she cut his hair for free. His hair parts best on the left, though. And when Hick spoke sharply to stop his \"wrong-way\" belt-threading, The Pony said, \"Wait.

Oh. Sorry about that if any of you faint at the sight or mention of blood. Perhaps you should sit down, put your head between your knees, and think about cotton candy and golden retriever puppies and rainbows and unicorns. There now. The rest of us are continuing on this adventure.I only noticed about three days after my hospital discharge that I had an egg buried under my skin around the waistline area. An ostrich egg, it felt like. Each day, it decreased a bit, to a double-yolk, a regular egg, a banty egg, then a jawbreaker. It's still there. But now I know what it is. My doctor said that when I got my third shot of intra-fat bloodthinner, the nurse must have nicked a small vein. So that blood leaked out and formed an egg. Okay, he didn't say it in those exact words, but that's what he meant. Now that midriff area is all colors of the rainbow, no longer deep purple, and itches like the dickens.Each day, I am careful not to enter an MMA title match, moonlight as a crash test dummy, climb into the dryer for a spin, or walk through a juvenile detention center like that of Sean Penn and Esai Morales in the original Bad Boys (caution, clip is rated R for raging bloody violence) after angering one of the detainees, lest I be beaten with several cans of cola in a pillowcase. And for the same reason, I do my best not to mess up Full Metal Jacket basic training drills for my fellow soldiers, lest they try the same trick with bars of soap in a pillowcase after I have succumbed to slumber in my upper bunk. I do everything possible to protect my network of veins and arteries from undue pressure.On Wednesday morning, I awoke with a sinus headache. My nasal cavities were congested. Since I did not think it prudent to swallow an aspirin, I reached for the bug-shaped mini-vibrator on the table next to Hick's La-Z-Boy. Don't go there. It's a little doodad off the shelf at Walmart. I put two of the feet on my head, and it vibrates that snot loose and relieves the headache. Of course, I have to blow my nose about twenty times, but it's worth it to lose the headache. Sometimes, I also have to apply those vibrating bug feet to my cheek area, and also push the ball of my nose to one side to get proper vibratage. I was doing just that Wednesday morning, when a bug foot slipped past my nose ball and whacked me really hard under my left eye, right on that orbit bone at the top of the cheek.I have been cautiously peering into the morning mirror to see if I have given myself a shiner. I must have few blood vessels across that thin-skinned bone, because as yet I do not look like I've taken a beating.That might be hard to explain."}, {"title": "Re-Visiting Val's Watery Grave", "date": "Thursday, June 5, 2014", "text": "Well.

The extent of Val's travels are Montana to the north, Massachusetts to the east, Florida to the south, and Alaska to the northiest and west. But I must protest this fish-trap theory.

Surely the citizens do not wander about, naked and afraid. Naked, maybe, after a few too many dirty-water cocktails. But I doubt they are afraid. Is this how they catch fish in New Jersey? My Magic 8 Ball says, \"My sources say no.\"Besides...it would take a mighty big fish to knock over this fence post of a stick.

It was more of an excited exchange. Something was wrong with the shower. As in, the shower was not showering The Pony with water.Hick came tromping downstairs.

We have no water. Tomorrow, when the drilling companies open, I'll swing by and see if they have a capacitor. I'll put it in and see if we get water.

She tried to waylay my RN, who made a quick getaway by saying, \"I'll tell YOUR RN.\" She almost ran from the room as Screaming Mimi sneered, \"SURE you will! You always leave! Nobody ever helps me!\" Visits to check on Screaming Mimi grew fewer and briefer. Which also meant visits to ME grew fewer.I was fairly self-sufficient. The staff had taught me to fend for myself. I'm surprised they didn't have me helping Screaming Mimi. I was the Tattoo to their Mr. Roarke. The Short Round to their Indiana Jones. The Ho-Jon to their Hawkeye Pierce. They taught me to turn off my pulse-ox machine before unplugging to get out of bed, so the alarm didn't go off. And how to turn it back on and adjust the volume so it didn't beep. I asked for very little. In fact, on shift change, one of the RNs told the new one, \"This is Mrs. Thevictorian. She's a gem.\" Indeed. Compared to the raw ore in the bed beside me.A new doctor came to attend Screaming Mimi, since the pulmonologist refused to listen to her rants. He even stayed for 30 minutes and helped the RN and two patient care technicians (one of whom was Bryce, her favorite fair-haired golden boy) change the dressings on her pressure sores while Mimi screamed that they were killing her. I think her exact quote was, \"WHY DON'T YOU JUST STICK A KNIFE IN MY HEART?\" The staff was good at tuning her out. The new doctor was a glutton for punishment. \"We need a way to admit her. She's only in for observation. I think this one is infected. It is oozing. We're admitting her.\" I could feel the spirit drain out of the staff at that pronouncement. After all that effort, new sheets for the third time that day, a clean gown, and two spoons for her morning coffee, Screaming Mimi showed her thanks by hollering as they left the room.\"We'll be back. Use the call button if you need us.\"\"YOU WON'T BE BACK! NOBODY COMES BACK! YOU ALL GO OUT TO THE MOVIES, OUT TO LUNCH. COME BACK HERE!\"Bryce stuck his head around the curtain. \"Sorry about that. Can I get anything for you?\"\"You are SO good at your job! I don't know how you do it. You're her favorite. No, I don't need anything.\"\"Oh, I used to work in a psych ward. A guy threw a chair through the window one day. You get used to it.\"Bryce got a call on his collar radio. He was quite busy that day. Somebody kept coming unhooked from their heart telemetry dealybobber, he had an old guy with diarrhea who needed frequent bed changes, patient switches that other care technicians asked for, and Screaming Mimi.Screaming Mimi decided that she needed to call her husband. \"HELP! HELP!\" It took a few minutes for the villagers to come see what new wolf Mimi was crying about. \"I want to make a call.\" Never mind that Bryce had already showed her how to dial an outside number on her phone. She wanted the RN to do it for her.\"Okay. I have the phone. What number do you want me to dial?\"\"ONE SIX SEVEN.\"\"Uh...that doesn't sound like the right number. Who are you trying to call? Your husband? I'll go check your records to find that number for you.\"\"NO! COME BACK! YOU'LL NEVER COME BACK!\" Not if she was smart, she wouldn't. Mimi Screamed for help again. Bryce returned.\"What can I do for you?\"\"I NEED TO USE THE BATHROOM!\"\"No, you can't go to the bathroom. Here. I'll get your potty. Now, let me get your legs over the edge so I can help you out of bed.\"\"DON'T TOUCH UNDER MY ARMS!\"\"I'm not. I'm using this gadget, like last time. It goes around your waist so I can lift you. Ready?\"\"OWWW! OWWW!\"Another patient care technician came in to see what was wrong. Bryce got Mimi on the potty. \"I WANT TO MAKE A PHONE CALL!\"\"Here. Here's your phone. Dial 9 to get out. I'll be back when you're done. Use the call button.\"\"NO! YOU NEVER COME BACK!\"\"I'll be back. But right now we're all going to Rome and Paris and London. Call me when you're done.\" Screaming Mimi was so taken aback by his humor concerning her earlier claims that she shut up. I heard her fiddling with the phone. And I heard Hick out in the hall. He was waiting for her to get off the pot. And I heard another voice. It was Screaming Mimi's husband!Mr. Mimi came in and told Mimi he had brought her a few things. She had her back to him on the pot, and talked to him like he was on the phone. A crafty one, that Mimi. The staffer that brought him in said, \"No, he's right here. Look. It's your husband. He came to visit.\" Well. That changed everything. Mimi started right in screaming at him for having her brought to the hospital. I had to feel sorry for the old guy.\"Maybe they can take care of you better than I can. They'll make you better. I'm sorry. I tried. Can I get you anything?\"\"YOU CAN GET ME OUT OF HERE! THIS PLACE IS A SHITHOLE! TAKE ME HOME!\"\"Now don't start. You're better off here right now. I can't do it.\" Mimi carried on with her screaming. Finally, Mr. Mimi said, \"I have to run down to the car. I left my cell phone in there. John is supposed to be getting in today. I don't want to miss his call.\" He left the room, as Mimi screamed away. Bryce came in to check on the hubbub and saw that Mimi had finally done her business on the pot. She demanded a new gown.\"I don't think you need one. That's just a tiny spot. It's not pee. It's a little drop of coffee you spilled with your spoon. It's okay for now. I have another patient waiting on me.\"Hick came back in. My RN came in and asked if I'd seen the doctor. I told her that he had said two hours ago that I could go home. She couldn't find it in the records, and went to call him. Physical Therapy came to make me take a walk around the nurses' station and lay down in bed unassisted. I passed the criteria on oxygen levels to go home. So all we had to do was hurry up and wait. Hick filled me in that Mr. Mimi went out in the hall and said, \"I have my cell phone. I just had to get out of there. I don't know how your wife has survived being in that room with her. I can't take it anymore.\"So...my orders finally came through around 3:00 on Sunday. I was parked in the hall in a wheelchair until Bryce had time to wheel me out. Mr. Mimi asked if I had gotten any sleep for the past two nights, and I told him, \"About three hours.\" Bryce said he told his other patients, who kept asking what was up with all the screaming, that I was a saint. He pushed me past the nurses' station while the RN said I wasn't cleared yet. \"Clear her!\" said Bryce, without slowing down. \"We'll be going out the main entrance.\"Just as we passed though the double doors, halfway into the sunlight, Bryce got a call on his collar radio that I was not supposed to leave, because I had a prescription waiting for me. He told the RN to bring it down. I think she was shocked. She got even, though, because she went to the wrong entrance, and stepped out and waved the paper, and made Bryce run to get it. Whew! I was afraid my getaway had been halted.I don't know what happened to Screaming Mimi and her poor put-upon husband. But something tells me if she's still at MoBap, the nurses just might be trying to find a way to legally give her heroin. Or at least chardonnay."}, {"title": "The Accused and Their Accuser", "date": "Saturday, May 31, 2014", "text": "After supper, which Screaming Mimi picked at and murmured how the white bean soup that came with her salad adorned with chicken was \"crap,\" she was given a dose of two tramadol by the RN. Ah...sweet solitude once again. For a few hours. You'd think a dose like that would knock out a tiny frail dry-skinned old lady for at least a day. But no. By around 10:00 p.m. Screaming Mimi was screaming again.\"HELP! HELP!\" You would have thought I was wrapping her oxygen tubing around her dessicated neck. She had been shown the call button. Screaming Mimi was no stranger to hospitals. But she preferred the dramatic route to get her way faster. The staff came running. \"I need to go to the bathroom.\"Now, the earlier crew had told her that she was not to get up. She was a fall risk. That's why she was admitted, for falling. They told her to use the pad on the bed. This new group offered her a bedpan. \"I'm NOT using a bedpan! Where's my walker?\"\"It's not here. Nobody brought your walker. You're not supposed to get out of bed.\"Screaming Mimi started to get up. That recording went off. \"Do not get up. Lie back down. A nurse will be here to help you.\" They persuaded her to stay put. Told her she was not going to the bathroom. Then they lost their heads. In their empathy, they offered Screaming Mimi a bedside potty. That meant someone had to help her on, and help her off. A production as detailed as this has not been attempted since the invasion of Normandy. Housekeeping was called for the potty. Three staffers tried to get Screaming Mimi up and out of bed. Gently. I could hear them apologizing to her. Faintly. Because mostly all I could hear was Screaming Mimi, screaming.\"OWWWW! YOU'RE HURTING ME! DON'T TOUCH ME THERE! OWWWW! YOU'RE KILLING ME! STOP IT! STOP IT!\"That's the short version. You know the staff is trained in helping eldsters in and out of the bed. That they do all they can to keep from hurting them, lest a complaint be filed. Screaming Mimi was a champ at plinging the guilty heart-strings. They got her up and on the potty. Then Leslie, the patient care technician, was left to attend to Screaming Mimi. I was on pins and needles. Not just from the stress of listening to Mimi's screaming. Leslie was a pleasant black lady who cheerfully answered the call button, and took her time to put you at ease before taking vitals. I was quite afraid Screaming Mimi might hurl some racial insults her way. Thank goodness, she did not. Attempted murder accusations was about as far as it went. Screaming Mimi was an equal opportunity abuser.Leslie spent over an hour at Screaming Mimi's bedside, waiting for her to pee. Screaming Mimi told Leslie all about her childhood, how she became a dancer, had a suitor she was in love with and loved her, but had an affair with another woman and did not ask Mimi to marry him. Screaming Mimi married another guy, but she didn't really love him. She spent time in Rome and Paris. Leslie nodded and \"uh huh\"-ed in all the right places. Let the record show that before Screaming Mimi had eaten supper and been dosed with tramadol, she had asked for books to read. The RN had said she would get Mimi two books, a mystery and a romance. Screaming Mimi said to that, \"I WANT FIVE!\" So she had a stack of books on her nightstand, and was wearing her glasses from before she fell asleep and subsequently got on the pot. I had heard one patient care technician mention, as she was getting vitals from a drugged-out Mimi, \"She looks so cute in those glasses.\" Like children, I suppose, the cranky elderly look so innocent while they're sleeping.Finally, her stories told, Screaming Mimi deigned to pee. Leslie was on it in no time. \"Oh, you're done. Good job.\"\"THAT'S WHAT YOU TELL A KID!\" spat Screaming Mimi. \"My son did that with his boy. EVERYTHING was GOOD JOB, GOOD JOB. FOR NOTHING! DON'T TELL ME GOOD JOB!\"Leslie was calm. \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.\"\"THEN WHY DID YOU SAY IT? GOOD JOB! LIKE I'M A LITTLE KID!\"\"I was just encouraging you. That's my job, to try to encourage people. I won't say it again. I'm sorry I offended you.\" Leslie helped Screaming Mimi back into bed, with loud screams of torture ringing around the room. Another patient care technician came in to check on the hubbub, and together they got Screaming Mimi repositioned. Then the other one left.Leslie stayed a minute. \"There. Now you're settled. I'm sorry if we hurt you. I know your skin is irritated. Look! Our glasses are almost alike!\"\"YOUR GLASSES ARE CHEAP!\"\"Did you just call my glasses CHEAP? I appreciate your honesty. You are something else. So how long have you been married?\"\"Fifty-nine years, and I would NEVER do it again! All he cares about is his GODDAM FUCKING FISHING BOAT!\"\"You've got a mouth on you!\"\"I KNOW! That's what my mother always said. She made me wear a sign around my neck.\" Screaming Mimi sounded almost proud. Smug.\"I've got to go check on other patients now.\"\"You'll NEVER come back!\"\"We'll be back. And if you need us, just push your red call button here. I'll leave this right beside you on the bed in case you need anything.\" Leslie popped around the curtain to see if I needed anything. She rolled her eyes and shook her head. But never once did I hear her or any other patient care technician be anything but sweet to Screaming Mimi.The next morning, Screaming Mimi was having another bout of vitriol over the bedside potty when the phlebotomist came in to take five more vials of my blood. She grinned from our safe side of the curtain. \"Sounds like you've got a live one there.\" Yeah. She didn't even spend the whole night with her.Screaming Mimi was so belligerent that when the pulmonary specialist came in for morning rounds, and stopped to talk to her, he would not stand for it. She insisted that she had her own doctor, and didn't need to tell him anything. \"Then why are you here? I'm going to talk to your neighbor.\" And just like that, he stepped from her side of the curtain to mine. Dismissed.The new RN came in to see what Screaming Mimi was up to. She had a different RN than me this time. One who asked her if she could do anything. Turn on the TV, perhaps? \"I HATE TV!\" I turned mine off and lay staring out the window. About a half hour later, with nobody to berate, nobody to con, Screaming Mimi said to me, in a childish little voice. \"I'm sorry about last night.\"\"Oh, that's all right. I know it's hard to be in pain.\"Yeah. Screaming Mimi knew exactly what she was doing. I did not start up a conversation, and left it at that.Tomorrow, we near the end of the Screaming Mimi saga, and see Val make her grand exit from the hospital."}, {"title": "So Let Me Introduce to You, the One and Only Screaming Mimi", "date": "Friday, May 30, 2014", "text": "Yes. It was the end of the halcyon day, the salad day, the day of wine and roses.An ambulance crew wheeled in Screaming Mimi. Not so much as a how-do-you-do to poor ol' Val, captive in her window bed, tethered to a pulse-ox machine on her left, and a wall-mounted oxygen spout by her nose. The crew unceremoniously yanked the dividing curtain, cutting off my view of the door and hallway and life beyond my adjustable bed. My world shrank to a window soon-to-be-shaded, a flat-screen TV mounted on the wall, and a flimsy blue-patterned piece of fabric. Oh, and Hick, who was ensconced in a visitor chair in the corner under the TV.Hick watched with his shifty eye. I hate it when he does that. He cuts his eyes toward the object of his snooping, without turning his head. As Screaming Mimi was downloaded onto her bed, Hick pantomimed the action. He held his hands about six inches apart. She's tiny. He held up his thumb and finger in the OK sign, with a hole about the size of a drinking straw, and tapped on his forearm. She's frail. He rubbed both palms on his forearms, then shucked the right palm over the left repeatedly, like a hillbilly whittlin' a pointed stick. Her skin is dry. Yeah. The most disturbing part is that I understood him. The next-to-most-disturbing part is that Hick did not realize that if he could see HER, she could see HIM.It's a good thing Hick has superb pantomime skills, because I could not have heard him if he'd blasted words at me through a bullhorn. Screaming Mimi was in full voice. \"STOP! OW! YOU'RE KILLING ME! OWWWWW! GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!\" Sometimes she forwent the words, and simply shrieked. The ambulance crew was quite apologetic. So, too, the hospital staff who were observing, ready to descend upon Screaming Mimi like a Daytona 500 pit crew. My teeth were on edge. I felt sorry for the old bird.Sometimes, first impressions are incorrect.I thought the poor dear was in the throes of dementia. That she was disoriented. That she was addled by pain. Until I spent 47.5 hours trapped in a room with her. What I gathered from listening through the curtain was that Mimi was 84 years old, that she was in for observation because she fell, that she had some gnarly bedsores, that she thought she was upper echelon and slumming in the hospital, and that she had a very short temper. The RN and Patient Care Technician made sure Screaming Mimi was settled in her bed. They put it down as low to the floor as it would go. Screaming Mimi had some sort of a LoJack contraption upon her person. Any time she would sit up, a voice would speak out of the blue: \"Do not get up. Lay back down. A nurse will be here to assist you.\"Far be it from Val to poke fun at a frail woman with dementia. Screaming Mimi's behavior seemed to be more of a manipulating nature. She could remember things just fine when it suited her. Like when she told the RN, \"Thank God I'm not at Barnes. That place is a shithole.\"Alas, the poor RN was trying to get Screaming Mimi settled, and provide her with an upcoming supper tray. To make her comfortable, and go on about her business of tending to a floor full of patients. This was the most straight-laced of all the RNs I had during my stay. Kind of like a Marcia Brady. Reserved. Like she just wanted things to run smoothly, for nobody to die, and to get off shift so she could heave a sigh of relief.\"Are you in pain? The doctor has left orders for you to have pain medication. Do you need it now?\"\"I want morphine and heroin.\"\"Oh. We can't give you heroin.\"\"Why not? They let me have it in London.\"\"Well, we're not regulated that way. No heroin. I'll see what your doctor has prescribed.\" Marcia Brady made her exit, and sent in Bryce, the patient care technician, to get the supper order.Screaming Mimi would not choose anything from the menu. She finally asked for chicken salad. Of course she would not specify whether she wanted a salad garnished with chicken, or chicken salad in a sandwich. When asked what to drink, though, she knew exactly what she wanted.\"Would you like something to drink?\"\"Yes. Wine.\"\"Oh, we don't have any wine.\"\"All right. Chardonnay.\"\"I'm sorry. You'll have to have something else. We don't serve alcohol.\"\"Diet Coke. Not because I'm trying to lose weight. I can't stand the taste of that sweet stuff. I used to be a dancer, you know. You never see a fat dancer.\"\"We'll get you Diet Coke.\" One thing for certain. Screaming Mimi LOVED Bryce. Throughout my stay, I never once heard her say a cross word or criticize him. The rest, though, would likely have had their heads mounted on pikes if Screaming Mimi had been more mobile.Her saga continues tomorrow."}, {"title": "You Don't Know What You've Got 'Til It's Gone", "date": "Thursday, May 29, 2014", "text": "In the continuing saga of Val's death-defying weekend...I had arrived at MoBap around 5:30 on Friday night. Hick showed up shortly, having gone by our house on the way to pick up items that I had not asked for and did not need. If only I had known he was going, I would have made several requests. As it was, I spent the night lolling about in a hospital gown and black dress pants.These were the halcyon days. The salad days. The days of wine and roses. REEEEEEEP! That's the scratch of the phonograph needle on a vinyl LP. Let me correct that. It was the halcyon DAY. The salad DAY. The DAY of wine and roses. The day I had a room to myself. The day before Screaming Mimi arrived. But I'm getting ahead of myself.Loyal Hick left me around 8:00 p.m. I turned on my very own wall-mounted flat screen and began to channel surf. Nothing much was on, but TV kept me company. Every hour, a staff member would walk in and look at me. Sometimes take vitals. My RN Christy left at 7:00 p.m., and was replaced by my RN Chrissy. She only had to wipe one letter off the white board and change it. I didn't notice much difference in them. Both had red hair, though Christy was more put together, and Chrissy was kind of an earth-shoe-wearing free spirit with braids that stopped just short of Pippi Longstocking territory. Chrissy shot a dose of blood-thinner into my belly around 10:00 (research after-the-fact shows that this drug should be injected into a fatty area, of which I have no shortage). Then I was pretty much left to my own devices to snooze or TV watch or gaze into space. My breathing was a little easier. I was given a bedside potty because I was not supposed to move around.Near 4:00 a.m., I had a bout of hand-tingling and shortness of breath. I pushed the call button and was quickly attended by the patient care technician. She used the little black phone dealybobber pinned to her collar to call Chrissy the RN. Chrissy used the pulse-ox thingy on the wall, and said my oxygen was at 97%, so she was not concerned about me getting air. Then she used her collar phone to call the attending, who said to hook me up to a continuous pulse-ox machine. That meant the sensor thingy got taped to the badfinger on my left hand, tethering me to a machine. Oh, and when my oxygen went below 88 percent, an alarm went off, which served to wake me from a delicious sleep two times.Saturday morning, still basking in my halcyon/salad/wine rose day, I was greeted at 5:00 a.m. by the phlebotomist. She might have been my favorite staffer of all. In she came in her dark blue scrubs, peeping to see if I was awake. \"I just need to take some blood.\" She was a sprite of a thing, hair pulled back in a ponytail like a college softball player, and a voice like Suzanne Pleshette after a month-long bout of chain-smoking. She glanced at my left arm, then made a beeline for the right.\"I have a really good vein there. But I already have this thing in my left arm.\" BloodSucker looked at it. Swung her ponytail. And commenced to binding a length of rubber tubing around my upper arm. \"Oh. Maybe you can't use that. I guess maybe it's for putting things IN, not taking things OUT.\"\"Right. Do you mind if I lay this stuff here?\" Nope. Val's lap is one big blood-tube-holding bin. I must say, BloodSucker did not cause a bit of pain, even when she said, \"Big stick.\" I felt nary a twinge. It was over before I knew it.My thyroid pill came at 6:00, then breakfast at 8:30. I had two pancakes, a link of turkey sausage, a bowl of oatmeal with brown sugar, a tiny tub of grape juice, and some red grapes. It was what I had ordered the night before, but I did not feel much like eating. I downed one pancake, the sausage, the grape juice, and half of the oatmeal. I admit that I took the grape container and set them aside for later. Not knowing at the time that Hick would eat them out from under my nose.At 10:00, cardiology came with a wheelchair to take me for a something-or-other test that was like an ultrasound of my heart. It involved a lot of deep breaths. Which I was not very good at. The technician was perhaps from Malaysia or Mexico. They're the same place, right? Not like that island, England. She had an accent, but I could tell when she said, \"Breath in, then.\" Her term for exhale I do not remember, nor did I recognize, but after breathing out the first time she said it, I caught on. When she wheeled me back to my room, she made me carry her fat red notebook like she had on the way there. As she foisted it upon my lap, a paper fell out. She went in front to get it, and that's when I saw it...Let me back up. As this lady was talking to me, I kept hearing a funny sound. A smashing, crunching, crispy sound. She made small talk about how much fluid accumulation I had. Probably not her business, but you know, maybe different cultures discuss these things as a matter of course. She had been unhappy with the main locking door not letting us in and out of that section of the hospital. The door would not stay propped for her to push me through. So she told me to reach out and hold it. I'm surprised she didn't just tell me to get up and walk through, or have me whip out a bobby pin to pick the lock when it wouldn't let us back out. Again, she seemed to have worked in a place with a lot less gewgaws and doodads than this hospital had. She did not take herself so seriously. In fact, she was not happy with her collar phone thingy not calling the people she asked for, because it could not understand her accent. But getting back to that crispy sound...as she bent over to pick up that paper, I saw that she held in her hand several squares of chopped-up apple. SHE WAS EATING THEM AS SHE PUSHED ME DOWN THE HALL. Seriously. She must have had some major one-arm strength to do that. I'm sure snacking on raw food while wheeling patients all willy-nilly is probably against hospital rules. Anyway, she got me back to my room and hooked up to the oxygen and the pulse-ox monitor again.By now it was time for lunch, which was pork loin, diced potato, green beans, and a strawberry shortcake. With grape juice. I did a little better this time, as I was breathing a little easier. Hick arrived to watch me eat. Genius came in shortly after. We talked a while. Genius had eaten, and would not accompany Hick to the cafeteria. Only Hick would come to the hospital at lunch time without having eaten first. So he had my grapes. Genius made his exit. I had time to wash up. Then the halcyon/salad/wine rose day was shattered by the arrival of Screaming Mimi at 3:30 p.m.A screamier screamer I have never heard that Screaming Mimi. A mere slip of a woman, 84 years old, seemingly in the throws of dementia. OR WAS SHE?More on Screaming Mimi tomorrow."}, {"title": "Val Thevictorian's Wild Ride", "date": "Wednesday, May 28, 2014", "text": "When we last gathered, you at the feet of Val Thevictorian, eagerly yearning for tales of her recent near-death experience, Val was awaiting transport to a city hospital from her Backroads ER facility.My chariot arrived at 3:30 p.m. I was strapped onto a hydraulic metal contraption with a gossamer covering some might loosely refer to as a \"mattress.\" The strapping looked like seatbelts or come-a-longs. I had an oxygen tank at my feet, to which my nasal cannula was attached. You all know what a nasal cannula is, don't you? It's that clear rubbery plastic thing with two prongs that sticks in your nose to spray oxygen. I was happy to have it.I had a needle taped to my left inner elbow, though Hick insisted it was NOT a needle, but made of plastic. Like he would know, what with it taped down, showing only the green plastic cylinder end suitable for shooting drugs into. I had not the breath to bandy words with Dr. Hick concerning my arm plumbing. Hick chose to follow the ambulance (ambulance chaser!) so he would have a way home from the hospital.My attendants warned me that the ride would not be smooth. I might best compare it to riding over cobblestones on steel wheels while laying on an iron platform. No shock absorbing going on. At all. My bed was locked into the floor of the ambulance. I had to brace myself with my good right arm against the side to keep from sloshing back and forth on turns and lane changes. I had a lovely view out the back door. A lovely view of tailgaters who had once again found Val Thevictorian, and like nothing better than to rattle her cage. The cage being this ambulance, which had an alarm every time a car got too close to one corner of the bumper or the other. My ride was a cacophony of corner-cutters. Though I wistfully looked for my Hick the entire ride, I did not see him. Little did I know he had run by the homestead to grab a couple of things he thought I might need. None of which I did. None of which included pajama pants or sweatpants.After an hour and a half of lesser gasping, and intermittent vitals checks, I arrived at my destination. I would not recommend riding in an ambulance down I-270 during rush hour on a Friday evening. I had to resort to closing my eyes, as the morphine and Ativan seemed to have worn off. Thank goodness the Lasix had flowed out of my body by the time the ambulance arrived.My attendants hauled me out of the back of the truck, into the bright sunlight, blinking like a bloated white critter exposed by an overturned rotting board. They whisked me into MoBap to an elevator bank, up to the sixth floor, around a roundabout, and into a cramped double room. How they unloaded me in those close quarters I still cannot quite fathom.The RN checked me in, I was ensconced in the window bed, vitaled, and offered a supper tray. That was great news, because all I had at the Backroads ER all day was a quarter of a turkey sandwich and two sips of hot Diet Coke. And THAT was an afterthought, at 2:30 p.m., when a nurse checked on me and asked how I was doing, and I replied that I was getting a little hungry. Apparently, folks at the Backroads ER are expected to fast from 7:45 a.m. until they are pawned off on a different hospital.We will leave me here tonight, in my MoBap bed, snug as a clotted bug in a tight rug, with visions of deep breaths dancing in my head.Little did I know what lay in store..."}, {"title": "And Now, the Beginning of the Rest of the Story", "date": "Tuesday, May 27, 2014", "text": "You might recall that Val had been uncomfortable with her (non)broken back for a few days. An injury which prevented her from taking a deep breath. The back unbroke itself after about three days, but the inability to breathe remained. I thought I must have picked up a bug at work. After all, I had felt like I was coming down with something a week ago Friday, and started to feel unwell in the Walmart line. The next day I took The Pony for shoeing, what with his upcoming summer adventure at Smart Camp on the horizon. I was a bit huffy and puffy that Saturday, but still thought I had a touch of the grippe. Sunday I (non)broke my back. Then I muddled through the week. I actually thought I was feeling better Thursday morning. But by Thursday night, I had decided to go into work Friday, ask for a substitute, and call my doctor. Then I decided I would just go to urgent care, to avoid the long walk into the building, up the elevator, and down the hall to my doctor's office. My mom offered to drive me.Friday morning, May 23, I was extremely huffy. I could hardly finish my shower. I told Hick, \"We're going to drop The Pony off at school, and then you're taking me to the ER.\" Only I said it about three words at a time, because I was gasping for breath. I sounded like Stevie Kenarban on Malcolm in the Middle. Hick wanted to meet my mom and have her take The Pony to school so we could go straight to the ER, but I said I needed to put my awards list in a teacher's mailbox. Next time, I will listen to Hick. I walked down that hall slower than a Galapagos turtle with narcolepsy. I hoisted myself into T-Hoe, and Hick took off for the hospital. We were there by 7:45 a.m.Being Hick, he did not drop me at the ER door, but parked so we could walk in. I did not think I was going to make it. A man in scrubs stood at the admit counter, and three women workers were behind. \"What are you here for?\"I leaned over the counter, trying to get my breath. \"Shortness...of...breath.\" I think that qualifies as irony.I gave my name, and the scrub guy said, \"You can sit down now, Ma'am.\" I thought he meant in the waiting area. Then he said, \"I have a wheelchair right behind you.\" Good thing. He whisked me down the hall, around some corners, and into an exam room. I climbed up on the bed, and a swarm of workers started working on me. One manned the computer, firing off questions. Another got an IV line going. Young Dr. Bailey, the attending, I suppose, asked me to lean forward while he listened to all lobes of my lungs. In the midst of the controlled chaos, one of the workers said, \"Wow. You really ARE out of breath.\" Like I needed to hear that. I guess I was just really impressive in the presentation of my symptoms.I got a portable chest X-ray. I got a shot of morphine, a shot of anti-nausea something-or-other, and a shot of Lasix. That's the stuff that makes you pee like a racehorse. The name comes from \"lasts six hours.\" And it did. I asked about the morphine, because I thought it slows the heart rate, and I could hardly get any air in. But one of the ambulance guys later told me it's a vasodilator, so it actually relaxes the blood vessels and makes the movement of oxygen easier.THEN I was told that I needed a CAT scan of my lungs. The radiology tech came in to explain it in detail. I like that. I like to be prepared. What I don't like is closed-in spaces and feeling trapped. So when she told me that I would have to be STILL and not move and take the exact same breath three times while a machine took pictures after dye was shot into me, or else the test would be ruined and it couldn't be done again for 48 hours...I became a bit apprehensive. I knew I had to have the test. But I felt like I couldn't have the test. I would freak out. Even though she said it would take 10 minutes tops. I was in tears. I heard them in the hall, nurse versus radiology tech. \"She thinks she's going it the tube. The MRI. If she sees it's not the tube, it's the donut, she'll probably feel better.\"Young Dr. Bailey came in. \"I understand you're nervous about the CAT scan. I can give you something.\"WELL WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO? I was definitely on board for that. So I got a shot of Ativan. As I told Hick later, \"I think that's the stuff they shoot into wild and crazy people on PCP, and it stops them in their tracks.\" Anyway, that did the trick. I had my CAT scan. Once in the room, I saw the donut, I laid down flat, closed my eyes, the dye shot into me, the donut apparently sucked me in then spit me out, and it was over. Whew! Good thing I didn't ruin that test, because that's where they found the multiple bilateral pulmonary embolisms. Then I got a shot in the stomach, like a common rabies candidate. It was Lovenox, and it had nothing to do with love.Young Dr. Bailey came in and gave me the talk. \"You have multiple bilateral pulmonary embolisms. This is serious. We don't have the doctors here at this hospital to treat such a serious conditions. We recommend that something this serious be treated at a hospital in the city. They have teams of doctors who can treat serious conditions like pulmonary embolisms. This is serious, and we will get you a bed at a city hospital. For something this serious, we will send you there by ambulance. We have a telemetry doctor who can discuss this serious illness with you on a computer screen. He will explain how serious these symptoms are, and what they will do for you there.\"Hick asked which hospitals we had a choice of, and picked MoBap. I hate that name when they use it on commercials, but after spending three days there, they can call it whatever they want. Hick was a bit concerned when Young Dr. Bailey left the room. \"I think this is serious. He must have used that word eight times.\"So...the next order of business was to hurry up and wait for an ambulance to drive me to the city, about an hour and twenty minute trip. First, though, my team had to treat a heart attack man who came in just after I was stabilized, and got a quick ride in the helicopter. Then there was the lady who failed her stress test, and was also waiting for an ambulance ride to the city. Did you know that no more than two ambulances can be out of our county at one time? It's true. That's why somebody in my serious condition waited from 10:45 until 3:30 to be transported. Funny how they can't treat me there, but they can let me lay around and wait for a ride. As Hick said around about 2:30, \"I could have driven you there and back by now.\"A regular person might have grown anxious, might have seen her life flash before her eyes in such a situation. But not Val. Val was embroiled in the drama, right down to the flapping, palpitating, oxygen-starved chambers of her heart.

Not that he's moving out, or paying bills, or ordering things online. He needs a way to access cash while he's gone this summer to Missouri Scholars Academy. On their website, they recommend traveler's checks. Seriously. Can you see 300 sixteen-year-olds using traveler's checks when they want to buy something. I, myself, cannot? So he's got a debit card. It only works on his account. His account only has enough money to see him through the Academy. Not taking any chances here.The thing about a sixteen-year-old getting a debit card is that a sixteen-year-old is a minor. As such, the sixteen-year-old needs an adult linked to his account. That means that the sixteen-year-old's account pops up whenever the adult goes to use her own card at an ATM.The Pony is a student of the world. He is quite observant, with a steel-trap mind. Many a time he's watched me drive up to our bank's ATM and withdraw cash. It's so easy for him, what with sitting directly behind me like a chauffeured passenger. All he has to do is glance out his window and take it in. Because Val is sometimes a practitioner of overkill, I took it upon myself to show The Pony how to use his new debit card last Saturday. The best-laid plans of Val herself often go awry.I had my mom in the real passenger seat, the shotgun seat, and The Pony in his chosen perch behind me. \"Look. I'll show you what to do when you need to use your card at the ATM. See? It's touch screen. Put in your pin, say you don't want a receipt, choose your transaction type, push the amount...look, both our accounts come up on mine now. See here? Mine is the one ending in XXXX. And yours is here, the one ending in YYYY. WAIT! I didn't want to do that! I barely touched it! Now it's taking that money out of your account! I'll have to drive around front and go in and deposit it back in. But we don't have a deposit slip. We'll have to use a counter deposit slip. WAIT! We don't have your account number. Oh. It will be on that receipt here from when we just put in your science fair winner's check. But I don't have my glasses. You'll have to come in with me and fill out the counter deposit slip. That's okay. It'll be a good learning experience for you. Don't worry. When you use YOUR card at an ATM, the only account that pops up will be yours. You won't have to worry about picking which one the money comes out of. Now, lets go get this straightened out.\"Today after school, I told The Pony I needed to go to the bank.\"Can you not take MY money this time?\"I swear.

Notso much greeted as startled.ThereI was, nearly dozing off, or slipping in and out of consciousness afterreturning home from dropping The Pony off at school, when I was startled awakeor into consciousness by a loud car. I saw it going up the gravel road, a redsports car leaving a trail of dust. And right behind it was a white pickuptruck. The strange thing about the white pickup truck was that it turned intomy driveway and proceeded to the house.I wasin no state to be answering the door. I had on my comfortable sweatpants with ahole on the left waist area (like mother, like daughter), and a pinstripedshirt that may or may not have been free of stains. And black socks. Besides, myaching back did not want to hoist itself out of the La-Z-Boy and cripple overto the door. I sat, mesmerized by the possibilities.Itcould be someone lost and asking for directions, in which case I owed themnothing. This is a private enclave. Nobody should be in here unless they havethe permission of a resident, in which case that\u2019s their direction-giver.Itcould be the package Genius was expecting.

Walked right across my front porch,past the living room picture window, past the porch pew, around the cornertoward the doghouses. He was a big man. Burly. With long curly hair and a beardlike that portly fellow on LOST, only blond. He did not glance left or right.Clomped right on past, as if on a mission. He made a return trip about twominutes later.I canonly surmise that he might have been the electric meter reader, though Ithought that was all automatic now. Besides, he was not carrying a club to beatdogs off his shins, nor a gadget to scan meters, nor an ID tag around his neck.He DID favor the bright neon green plastic work vest favored by certain utilitycompanies. His truck was not marked, but had a yellow light on top that couldflash if needed.Ifthis was part of the universe\u2019s conspiracy to spy on Val Thevictorian\u2026I mustsay, the quality of spies is not all it\u2019s cracked up to be.

Who are you people, Charlie Brown hoping to kick a football held by Lucy Van Pelt? This leopard is not about to change her spots.I am running on four hours sleep. Here, let me reveal the details. They have nothing to do with a pea under the mattress.5:15 p.m. to 6:15 p.mA sound slumber in the basement recliner, awaking to a dream phone ringing. Which turned out to be the real phone, The Pony on the other end, saying his dad wanted him to call and see if I was all right, because I had not been feeling well when he left. The fleeting moments of pain-free-ness quickly turned to tear-evoking back spasms.11:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m.I nodded off under my fleece blanket, all warm and toasty watching TV, again in the downstairs recliner. I woke up because it was time to go to bed. Which was one of the slowest trips up 13 stairs upon which I had ever embarked.4:00 a.m. to 4:50 a.m.Funny how I could not fall asleep at 1:30 in my flannel-sheeted queen-size. I tried laying on my side, in order to slip that dislocated spasm-generator back into place. Funny how my back quit hurting, but my neck started up. Oh, and not funny how every time Hick flopped over, I sailed up and down like a jolly good fellow in a blanket toss. I hadn't been that jolted since Hick drove me through the fields of my grandma's Christmas tree farm in his old pickup while I was in early labor with Genius, who was born at 9:24 the next morning.Yes, that's ten minutes short. But I'd rather think of myself getting four hours sleep than three hours and fifty minutes of sleep.I made it through work without any major sleepage incidents. The back held up. Seriously. This is public school with seven days left, testing over, only fun projects left to do. It's not like I was on the Boys' Town Wagon Train Train Ride.The main thorn in my side was the little dude at the register in Save A Lot on the way home. We went to pick up The Pony's new glasses, and I stopped at the lesser Save A Lot for some hamburger to add to the four-cheese tortellini that The Pony wanted for supper. While I was there, I tossed in some frozen garlic toast, and three individual packs of Soft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies because The Pony asked for them. With my back still tender, I piled my items in the upper child seat area of the cart, so as to invoke no bending and lifting.The cashier slid my foodstuffs over the scanner and tossed them in the waiting cart. There were only five items, people. How hard is it to attend to them properly? Apparently, the difficulty level is on par with herding a clowder of cats from Independence to Oregon City. He flung my purchases into the waiting child seat, which was more ready for a child, what with the flat red plastic seat flap down, not up against the handle. Two of the Soft Batch treats slammed to the tile floor at 98 meters per second squared.That meant Val of the (non)broken back club had to bend over and retrieve them.

Who knew I would be laid up with a broken back on this very date? Okay. So my back has not been officially diagnosed as broken. The internet tells me it is a rib that popped out of its little socket, and now the surrounding muscles are rebelling, and perhaps keeping it from slipping right back where it belongs.I saw a cohort on the school parking lot this morning when I dropped off The Pony. She had the same malady last week, and looked like death warmed over for three days. The difference is, she acquired her injury from working out. Mine was from...um...not working out. She laughed and told me she knew I was miserable, and that she hoped I would get over it quickly. Too bad laughing did not cause her a relapse. I asked how she got through it, and she replied, \"Muscle relaxers and a trip to the chiropractor.\" Since I have neither, I will be toughing it out. She did recommend ice, which I applied around noon, and obtained some relief.From school, I went by my mom's house to drop off The Pony's laptop. Mom was picking him up from school today, then Hick was getting him after work for an informational meeting in preparation for his Missouri Scholars Academy attendance this summer. I didn't get out to visit with Mom. I still had to make a trip to Walmart for a few items. Saving my energy was important. Of course Mom made me laugh, and that set off a renewed spasm of agony.Thank goodness Walmart had a cart for me to lean on like a walker. Or so I thought. It seems that the Walmart floor-sweepers are not as conscientious as they might be, or that hooligans run amok on the makeup aisle. Believe me, I was not shopping for makeup, but merely taking what I believed to be a shortcut. One lady was blocking the aisle. She kind of huffed and hauled her cart over to the side. I'm pretty sure she's one of those drivers who take her half out of the middle as well.So there I was, wheeling my walker cart up the makeup aisle, when IT SLAMMED TO A STOP LIKE I HAD COLLIDED WITH A BRICK WALL! Oh, my aching back. That set off a new spasm. It was all I could do not to scream. I didn't want that blocker woman to think I was challenging her to a fight. I pulled my cart back in an effort to lose whatever had acted like a tire wedge on my left front wheel. You won't believe what stopped me in my tracks and caused me such agony.IT WAS A PINK PRESS-ON FINGERNAIL!That definitely added insult to my injury. I need to stay home, wrap myself in roll of carded cotton, lay down on a mountain of memory foam, and heal. But I am needed at school, what with the end finally in sight, and the students having a whiff of freedom cross their nostrils every fifty minutes.

Perhaps you've heard that Val does not so much \"cook\" as she warms foods in the microwave, or heats them in the oven. My repertoire has been hacked in half.Thursday morning, I packed up the lunches and reached for the microwave handle to warm my two mini sausage biscuits. Imagine my surprise when it popped out like a pump handle on the upswing. With a loud CRACK, to boot! Huh. My long black plastic microwave door handle, shaped like a bow, attached at top and bottom...was now only attached at the top. Val is nothing if not resourceful. And hungry for mini sausage biscuits in the morning. I grasped the top attachment area of the microwave handle. Pinched it between thumb and forefinger. I could still get the door open.Fortified by my mini sausage biscuits, I shot off a text to Hick so he would know that the microwave door handle was broken. He texted back, \"Okay.\" Like he had a say in the matter, giving me permission after the fact. I hate it when he does that.After a late night at the board meeting for a student recognition ceremony, the Thevictorian family once again convened at home. Hick stopped on his way back to pick up some epoxy. He took out the top and bottom screws, slathered that handle in glue, then reattached it. \"There. We will order a new one anyway, because we're probably going to need it down the line.\" I don't know about your definition of down the line, but I somehow expected it to be longer than ten hours.Friday morning, when I reached for the microwave handle to warm up my mini sausage biscuits, the entire assembly came off in my hand. So close. But yet so far. I had mini sausage biscuits waiting. So I stuck my fingernails up under the bottom of the door, and pried it open. Nothing comes between Val and her mini sausage biscuits. Oh, and I made sure to send a text to Hick. \"Good job. Now the whole handle broke off.\" As you might imagine, Hick replied. \"Okay.\"Friday night, Hick headed to his basement workshop. I heard him rummaging, but was not invested enough to check on his progress. It was still twelve hours until I needed mini sausage biscuits. The Pony ran upstairs for some ice water, and came back with news from the microwave front. \"You won't have to worry about the microwave anymore! Dad put TWO handles on the door!\"Of course this news set off an alarm bell in the back of my head. A microwave door should not need two handles.

Closed system settings because it was all Greek to me.AND MY INTERNET CONNECTED!I told Hick to tread lightly if he got out of his chair. I resisted the urge to fist-pump, and started down the steps.

Becomes a risk taker of the intermediate order. Attempts a feat others might consider foolhardy. Today was one of those times.I had packed my lunch as usual. Turkey on whole wheat English muffin, with a side of a snack-size yellow bag of Lays Potato Chips. I plopped it on a paper plate and headed for the cafeteria, where I snagged my rightful seat with my back to the serving line, my vista the entire expanse of tables hosting freshmen in a feeding frenzy. It was Sloppy Joe day. We don't have it often.Two colleagues were already seated. One eating a salad, the other eating a sammich of some kind. I would call it a sandwich, but it looked more like a sammich. You could tell the guy made it himself. I noted that my left-hand companion had passed me as I was entering. Then I saw the across-the-table gal meander down the hall instead of coming to our table. In fact, my right-hand man had no sooner cut into line ahead of the students when Salad-Eater called to one of the kids, \"Hey! Tell Mr. Right-Hand Man that there's mostaccioli in the workroom! We made too much.\"Ahem. Was I not worthy? She had watched me unwrap my sandwich and open my chip bag and pour them on the plate. Mr. Right-Hand Man came out with a tray bearing two Sloppy Joes. Two milks. Two cups of fruit salad. Two tray sections of broccoli. \"I'll probably finish this, and go get some.\" He sat down and spread out his lunch like he was Emilio Estevez in The Breakfast Club. Salad-Eater must have suddenly noticed my near-invisible self sitting at Mr. Right-Hand Man's left hand. \"Oh, I forgot to tell you. There's mostaccioli in the workroom.\"Of course I would not get up to get any at this juncture. Not that I was too proud, mind you. But a good 7-10 minutes of the 23-minute lunch period had already passed. Not enough time to dish up a plate and chow down. Here came Left-Hand Companion and Cross-Table, both bearing steaming plates of mostaccioli. They are not as punctual as I after lunch. They do not have the high-maintenance group that needs above-adequate supervision. The can linger longer.So...flash forward to the golden ten minutes after final bell. That twilight where you can't leave the building, but technically your day is over. An announcement blared from the ceiling. \"Attention, staff. There is mostaccioli in the workroom if you want to take some home for supper.\" Well. Alrighty then. Remember Supermarket Sweep? Those cart-wielding maniacs had nothing on Val. I ready to be first off the starting line. All I needed was a suitable container. Okay. A container. One that didn't leak.I ripped open my cabinets and figuratively kicked myself for taking home those four Chinese soup containers I had kept in the cabinet for a month, full of reward sugarless gum for participants in one student's science project. But wait! There was one soup container left. It had been there all along. For years. Full of Hot Wheels cars for a potential/kinetic energy activity. We had just used them a couple weeks ago. Students handling those cars every hour, rolling them down ramps and across the floor. And there they were, sitting in a soup container. I dumped the Hot Wheels out on the shelf. Gave the soup container a quick swipe with a white school-issue paper towel. Val was in business. The mostaccioli business! I took off for the workroom in the manner of Peter, Aunt Polly's cat, after Tom dosed him with Pain Killer.One staffer was already there, gazing at the large rectangular warming dish. For lack of a container, mostaccioli was lost. But wait. Staffer had kitchen connections, and scurried off to look for mostaccioli transporters. I bellied up to the counter and began wielding the ladel. I pounded that soup container to eliminate air spaces. I packed it full. Salad-Eater wandered in. \"Do you need more containers?\"\"No, thanks. I have this one. Oh, is this safe? Will we get food poisoning? Has it been sitting out all afternoon?\"\"Yes, but it's been on. It's been kept hot. It should be okay.\"I guess she knows about food handling. It's kind of her job. Maybe I forgot to mention that this mostaccioli was made by students. Last Friday. And served at the Extraordinary Dance on Saturday night. Then stored until today. And put out again and heated. All afternoon. Until I placed it in an old Chinese soup container that had minutes before held Hot Wheels cars that had been manhandled by freshmen crawling around on the floor.Every now and then, Val throws caution to the wind."}, {"title": "And Now, the Queen for a Day is Going to Bake a DiGiorno", "date": "Sunday, May 11, 2014", "text": "Hey! I'm going to let you in on a little-known secret: I'm a mom! I know how shocking that must be. Maybe I should have warned you to sit down first, rather than spring it on you, after all these years of keeping my children secret, never mentioning them here on the ol' blog.Genius sent me a wonderful card from college. So what if he had to sell a little plasma to get the money? He even mailed it in plenty of time, so I got it on Thursday. It was a card showing the loving influence of moms behind great people in history. And on the last page was a little mirror. Perhaps it's more of a statement by Genius that he has lofty goals and plans to become a great person in history. I particularly liked the vignette of Einstein, with his mother telling him to do something about his hair before he went out. The Pony preferred the one where Sacajawea's mom scoffed, \"You mean you found a man willing to ask for directions?\"This morning, Hick started off my pampering by only huffing twice and giving me the stink-eye once when I asked to get in the bathroom while he was standing at the sink in his tighty-whities filling his old-man weekly medicine-dispensing gadget. He then allowed me to do the Save A Lot and Walmart shopping, and two loads of laundry while he sharpened his lawnmower blade for three hours.The good times kept on a-rollin'. While on the way back from shopping, The Pony revealed that Hick was going to grill the evening meal. Huh. First I heard of it. Because if I had known, I would most likely have picked up some meat to grill while in Save A Lot or even Walmart. Since I did not plan to make a third store-stop, we agreed on frozen pizza for supper. The next best thing to not cooking. Hick even came out to carry in the groceries.The Pony gave me a musical card with a 1950s housewife on the front, wearing an apron, pulling a roast beast of some kind from the oven, which played the tune, \"Yummy Yummy Yummy I've Got Love in My Tummy.\" The inside said, \"You really know how to make dead things taste good.\" He's such a little charmer. Hick's card was roughly the size of a sheet of 4' x 8' plywood. That's because he loves me so much. It had a little bow, and some sequins and rhinestones, and was very pink. That's because it obviously appealed to Hick's feminine side, and because he knows what a giggly girly-girl I am. Still, it brought a tear to my eye due to the message, and not at all related to the price. The stepsons kicked in with celebratory texts, so all accounts have been settled.Next, we went out on the porch to see my present. I hit the jackpot this year. I got two yellow rosebushes to replace the one that died, and a concrete birdbath. Never mind that the concrete birdbath had the bottom of the bathing part coated with dirt. I asked if it was a used birdbath, and The Pony jumped to Hick's defense. \"It cost TWELVE DOLLARS!\" Well, then. It was a smart purchase. I hope the chickens don't poop up the water for the regular birds who may desire to bathe.Oh, and on the way to town to mow my mom's yard, Hick and The Pony planned to stop and get me a $69 pear tree to plant in the front yard. Just around the time all my teeth fall out, I'm going to have some pears to gum! And it will blossom all prettily between now and then.This was definitely better than the Box of Snowcaps/Three-Dollar Change Purse Mother's Day.Hick done good."}, {"title": "More Mishaps by My Mom", "date": "Saturday, May 10, 2014", "text": "With Mother's Day approaching us in mere hours...I would be remiss in not updating folks on what my mom has been up to lately. I'm a bit concerned. Two recent episodes are out of character for the hot-natured slaw aficionado.Last week, Mom told me she was headed to town to pick up a few things. \"I really don't have much to get. The main thing is slaw. I ran out.\" WHAT? Mom ran out of slaw? That's like somebody letting Carl T. Griffith's 1847 Sourdough Starter die off. Mom always has slaw. And spare slaw as a backup. The weather has not even kept Mom housebound at the bottom of her driveway. I can't believe she ran out of slaw!Also last week, on Wednesday, I believe, Mom spoke softly on our morning phone call. \"Are you sitting down? I don't want you to faint and hit your head.\" I guess that was her way of saying she didn't want me to knock myself unconscious while I was unconscious. \"Are you ready? I just wanted to tell you that I turned my air conditioner on last night.\" WHAT? Mom turned on her air conditioner in April? That's tantamount to celebrating Christmas four months early. Mom never turns her air conditioner on until August. It's like a ritual for her. She dabs at the damp hair tendrils sticking to her neck, with paper towels (torn in half, of course), while lounging about in shorts and t-shirts, barefoot, professing that her house is cool, really, and she sees no need to waste money on air conditioning. Yes, our temperatures here in Backroads it the very upper 80s last week. Still, I'm shocked.This morning she had a story to tell me. The Pony spent the night with her, so she went to the store around 7:00 to get him some donuts for breakfast. While she was in line, the cashier asked if she was with the man in front of her. The cashier was already ringing up his groceries. \"Oh, NO!\" said Mom. At the same time, the guy in front of her turned to look at her, and also exclaimed, \"Oh, NO!\"Being Mom, she could not leave well enough alone. She always has to talk just a bit too much. She used to complain that an old lady in my childhood neighborhood would never say \"Bye\" during their phone calls, but would simply hang up when Mom was in mid-sentence. I'm not sure one can inherit such a trait. I'm sure nobody who reads here would even consider Val to be long-winded. But I have a sneaking suspicion that the old colleague I used to coach basketball with used a similar tactic to get off the phone with me. Can you imagine? And after HE called ME. It just seems unlikely that every time we were discussing practice, somebody would come to his door. \"Oops! I've gotta go. Somebody's ringing the doorbell.\" Oh, I could actually hear the doorbell. But then he let slip one time, on a long bus ride, that he had gotten off the phone with the track coach's wife by reaching out on the porch to ring his own doorbell. The nerve of that guy! He could at least have had one or both of his twin daughters do that deed.But getting back to Mom in line with a box of glazed donuts...she told the cashier. \"Well, maybe I'm with him, if he's paying for my donuts.\" AND THE GUY DID!\"Here. Let me pay for those. Mother's Day is tomorrow. I'd like to pay. Really. Put that on my bill.\"Of course Mom was mortified. She may count her change when I pay her for something she's picked up for me at the store, she might starve a tiny puppy rather than toss it a crust of bread, and she might only donate five dollars to the Extraordinary Dance, but she is really a generous lady who likes to pay her own way and not be beholden to anybody. She regretted not shutting her mouth. She had no idea the guy would offer to pay.\"It conly got me,\" Mom said. That's Backroads-speak for \"I was surprised.\" We have our own lingo here in the hinterlands.The Pony brought home the remainder of his donuts. Written on the box was $2.40. I'm not going to tell The Pony that a strange man bought his breakfast.I might need to keep an eye on Mom.

That other place serves up what seems to be fried rice swimming in the oil it was fried in. Every item I have ever received has been surrounded by a moat of shiny liquid. I don't care how much others rave about it, that place is not for me. That food goes through me like grease through a goose.Now we have issues with Our Chinese. That place is going downhill faster than a rock that Sisyphus has just pushed to the top of the hill.The issue is chicken. I don't like their cashew chicken because I can't find the chicken. Just like Glen Campell as LaBeouf in the original True Grit was warned by that squirrel-headed bastard at The Monarch Boarding House that he would hurt his eyes looking for the chicken in the chicken and dumplings...I must warn others that looking for the chicken under those three cashews and assorted vegetables (meaning flat strips of carrot and celery and a few water chestnut discs) might cause blindness. If you have eagle eyes, you might find several cubes similar to those found in a generic chicken pot pie, or in Campbell's Chicken and Noodle Soup.I have tried the Hunan chicken, but since Hick also partakes of this delicacy, it means they whip it up as one batch, and I invariably get all the vegetables in my container with white rice, while Hick gets all the meat in his container with fried rice. And you don't go taking meat away from Hick unless you are prepared to lose a hand. It would be safer to tug on Superman's cape, spit into the wind, and pull the mask off that ol' Lone Ranger.The hot braised chicken and General Tso's chicken present a bonnet bee of the first order. The chicken is fried and soaked in sauce. The soaking, I assume, is to soften it until it appears edible. It used to be actual pieces of white meat chicken in a batter. I would even settle for dark meat chicken in a batter. But lately I get chicken skin in a batter, fried, soaked in sauce. That's all I can imagine this substance to be. There's no visible meat if you can manage to cut it open. It chews like a piece of rawhide. I would like to challenge them to find the chicken. Recent blindness is not an excuse.Hope springs eternal every time Hick calls on his way home and asks if we want him to pick up Chinese. Every time, I think I will give them one more chance. Tonight, their chance ran out. I could not finish what I put on my plate, even though I risk losing my membership in the Clean Plate Club. My sweet, sweet Juno is in for a treat. I hope these fried skins are not any more dangerous than chicken bones.It's back to soup for me. At least I can see the tofu."}, {"title": "Dreamcrushers, Realists, and Joysuckers", "date": "Thursday, May 1, 2014", "text": "Let\u2019stalk about dreamcrushers.

For example, one of myclasses inquired, \u201cWhat does The Pony want to do when he grows up, Mrs.Thevictorian?\u201d\u201cWell,he wants to be a writer. But his dad and I have told him that he needs to havea steady income with benefits, and he can write in his spare time, and if hestarts making money at it, he can quit his day job. We\u2019ve been discussing thefield of chemical engineering. Chemistry is a subject he finds easy.\u201d\u201cOh.So you\u2019re a dreamcrusher.\u201dNo.Realist. If I was a dreamcrusher, I would tell him, \u201cYou can\u2019t write. You mightas well give that up right now. You\u2019ll never be a famous author. You\u2019ll neversell any books. Nobody wants to read anything you write.\u201d THAT is adreamcrusher.Thenthere are the joysuckers. They appear after the fact. Those people who won\u2019tlet you experience one moment of joy. They must bring you down, right in themiddle of a celebration.Yesterday morning, I showed a few people at schoolpictures of my newest pet. This little guy: Yes.He\u2019s cute as a bug\u2019s ear. Hick traded four goats for him. Most people oohed andaahed over his cuteness. Except one. Who didn\u2019t even see the picture from myown hand, but had it carried on my cell phone to her classroom, by a colleaguewho gushed, \u201cOh! We\u2019ve GOT to show it to her.\u201dSo\u2026Iwas showing another associate that minipony, and Joysucker walked past us andsaid, \u201cBut what are you going to DO with him?\u201d Not in a joking manner. With akind of a scowl. Like she is the Minipony Police. Hmpf!I have as much right to a pet minipony as any other person on earth. More,maybe, because I have a place to keep him. What did she THINK I was going to dowith him?Didshe think, perhaps, that I might\u2026Shuthim up in a ramshackle shed?Travel the county fair circuit and charge people to ride him?Send delicious cuts of him to France?Put the cart before him?Use his tiny teacup hooves to make a glue stick? No. Iwill love him and pet him and brush his lovely mane and maybe even his longflowing tail if he\u2019s not quick with his hooves, and keep him in a four-acre pen with goatbuddies and let him out to graze on a rope in the front field.Whatwould she SUGGEST I do with him?Somepeople are just joysuckers.

I don\u2019t have cable,so I may not be the most reliable of sources. I used to have cable when I livedin town, and it was out at least one day a week. Not that I got a reduction onthe bill or anything.Mymom was all discombobulated because she doesn\u2019t want the boxes. I thought itwas simply because the elderly don\u2019t like change. Then she was upset becauseDISH Network tried to stiff-arm her into getting a credit card or using mine inorder to establish service with them.Well,well, well. I\u2019ve gathered a bit more information on CableGate. The talk at theteacher lunch table was that if you don\u2019t get the boxes, you won\u2019t get asignal. You have to get a box for each TV in your house. And there is a monthlyservice charge of $24 PER BOX! That\u2019s highway robbery! The one telling thestory has five TVs. She said that they just found out about the box thingy,because their bill is paid and they don\u2019t even open the envelope when a paperbill arrives. She sent her husband to the office to pick up the boxes, and hesaid they had an ARMED GUARD in the lobby, because people were so hateful aboutbeing forced to get the cable boxes.Oh,but it gets better. The counter clerk complimented Luncher\u2019s husband on hispolite behavior. In fact, they told him that since he was so polite, they weregoing to give him his cable boxes for half price. Don\u2019t that just beat all? Shesaid that other people were coming in, declaring, \u201cThis is CRAP! We don\u2019t wantthe boxes. We don\u2019t want all those channels. We are fine with what we have.\u201dI hadto agree with them. \u201cWell, it IS crap if they can pick and choose who getsservice for half price. How fair is that? Obviously, they can afford to giveaway the service to SOME people, so they must have jacked up the price to beginwith.\u201d\u201cI\u2019mnot sure they gave him the boxes for half price. Maybe they gave him an upgradefor the regular price.\u201d\u201cSamedifference. Some people get a special rate on the whim of the counter clerk.That\u2019s no way to run a business.\u201dIalso found out that my mom was getting her cable box fee waived for the firstyear. She didn\u2019t say why. Maybe it was because she was threatening to ditch themfor DISH. Maybe it was because she\u2019s a septuagenarian. In any case, that\u2019s notfair, either.Momwas really upset this morning. \u201cEver since Genius hooked up my cable box, Ican\u2019t tell what time it is in here.

In fact, it got to the point where Hick would ask The Pony, \"Did you collect THE EGG today?\" Since not much was going on in the laying department, Hick started grabbing THE EGG after feeding the livestock, and bringing it in himself. Before you go accusing my sweet, sweet Juno of partaking of the hen fruit each day while we are away at work, please consider the fact that there has been an upturn in egg production.Last week, Hick found a hen sitting on a pile of eggs. And before that, we got three surprise chicks. So I'm thinking those crafty hens have been laying in new hiding places. Life would be so much simpler if we kept them in a pen, rather than letting them have the run of 20 acres. Of course, they prefer to stay close by, like in the front yard, the front woods, or on the front porch.We used to get a variety of eggs, from white, thanks to the leghorns, and greeny blue, thanks to the Ameraucanas, and brown from the black silkies, and tiny brown from the black banties. We might or might not have gotten one or two from the checkerboard banty couple. Alas, many of our feathered friends are no longer with us, due to predators in the night and possibly daytime while we're away. So lateley, all of our eggs have been big and greeny blue. Like the one on the left.Hick and The Pony were gone over the weekend, to the Missouri USBC Youth Bowling Tournament. Hick picked up a couple of eggs before he left Saturday. On Sunday, he found another one. Monday evening, he called for The Pony to come collect EGGS. I was in the kitchen when he returned with three in his hands. The Pony put them in the wire egg basket on Hick's section of the counter, by the door.\"Aren't you supposed to take the basket outside to collect the eggs? Isn't it a bit backward to put the eggs in the basket when you get back in the house?\"\"Well, Dad just said to come get them. He didn't say to wash them. So I'm leaving them here for him to do that. Besides, I didn't need the basket.\"\"Wasn't it hard to carry three eggs in your hand and open the door?\"\"Not really. And that's not all.\" The Pony reached down below the counter. \"He started pulling out eggs like a magician pulling an endless string of handkerchiefs. \"I put some in my pocket.\"I imagined one or two. But no. The Pony pulled six eggs out of one pocket on his shorts.\"What if the dogs had bumped against you? Or if you had tripped and fallen down on the big flat rock that looks like the United States?\"\"But I didn't. So it doesn't matter.\"Oh, for the days when The Pony grabbed his little red & green Easter basket and ran out the front door looking for eggs every evening.

Lest you think this is a rhetorical question, and sit there on your typing fingers without answering...it is not. I can't HEAR you! What's that? Somebody said, \"Yes.\" What a wiseacre! If you said, \"Yes,\" I must require you to provide a name, physical description, and address of the dirty (non-flying) bird who can top Hick's daily quota of dirt inside a 1600-square-foot home.Sure, there's probably some mutant male with webbed feet for scooping, and suction-cup toes for a vacuum effect, with hair on his tootsies like velcro for clingage, his man-hooves exceeding the length of Bigfoot's so that in the future, a Sasquatch will be known as Tiny-Ped, who could achieve this level of Pig-Pennage. Until I am informed of his name and whereabouts, Hick is still the champ.I could sweep the kitchen floor twice daily and still not have a smooth surface on which to walk without getting a stone bruise from a clod deposited by Hick's clodhoppers. If I let these zigzag lightning bolts of dried mud accumulate, we would soon find ourselves gasping in the thin air of a new summit, Mount Clodamanjaro. The topsoil of Backroads has surely been shaved down to bedrock with Hick's daily collection of dirt. He could have been a hero in dubya dubya eye eye, in that Stalag Luft III, helping the Allied prisoners make a great escape, hauling the tunnel dirt out onto the yard. He coulda been buddies with James Garner!Hick does not see himself as a record-holder. In fact, he modestly denies his talents. He seems to think other residents deserve partial, if not ALL, the credit for this clodfest. Alas, circumstantial evidence is not in his favor. The Pony and I walk from the concrete-floored garage, onto the concrete sidewalk, up the wooden steps, across the wooden porch, and into the kitchen. No dirt on our soles. Until we get inside, of course. Where we are subjected to the mine field of topsoil fragments lolling upon the linoleum, crushing them like so many grapes under Lucy and Ethel's feet. We can't help ourselves.

My old house, the $17,000 one in town, had two beautiful lilac bushes. One bloomed light purple flowerets, and the other bloomed dark purple. I would step out of the car and bury my face in the light purple lilacs by the driveway. When we built our house in Outer Backroadsia, I yearned for my lilacs. Hick dug up two bushes from my grandma's yard. Grandma was happy to donate them. She was also an old-school realist. \"It takes lilacs seven years to bloom.\"It did! Took seven years for my fragrant flowers to pop out. Then the first year of bloomage, the smaller bush froze to death. That's all I can surmise, after it grew seven years to fruition, then went kaput. The other took off. Shoots shot out in all directions. It even bloomed in OCTOBER the year my Grandma passed away. Yes. I have photo evidence:True, the entire bush did not bloom in the arid scorched earth of early October. Some leaves remained withered from the drought. But a few respectful blooms popped up in honor of Grandma.Then Hick grew careless in goat-tending. The goat herd was in its heyday. I think we had over a dozen. Of course lilac bushes are like candy for goats. Forget the tin cans and thorn trees and cedar bark. Goats luuuurrrve themselves some lilacs. At times, I caught them munching away on the tender shoots and tasty leaves. Hick swore that he took his eyes off them for only a second, and one got away, then the others followed. Uh huh. Low on a mower sat a piddling goatherd, not paying a bit of attention to his furry, four-legged locusts.The caprine invasion did not just happen once. Or twice. It was a regular weekly affair. I even caught Hick trying to camouflage the evidence. Okay. The Pony tipped me off. He duct-taped some major branches back together after Goatrude, the ring leader, stood on her hind legs to reach the most succulent morsels, and broke off limbs with her forelegs.As we came up the driveway last week, The Pony said, \"Look at your lilac bush.\" He was not taunting me. He was actually trying to cheer me up. \"It's blooming. See?\"\"It looks like a poodle. Lilac bushes should be covered with blooms. Blooms so heavy that limbs hang low. Mine has a few sprigs. It's sad, really. It used to be beautiful.\"Now, with a different bad phone camera, I have preserved the evidence of my lilacs decline. The lush spring colors cannot hide the lack of lilacs, or the beat-down those goats gave the grass.It's the epitome of pitiful. To add insult to my lilac bush's injury...I looked out the front window and saw what I thought was a hummingbird going to town on my lilac florets. I saw the flutter of wings. Then that critter landed on my lilacs! Upon closer inspection, I saw that it was not a hummingbird, but a large butterfly.So fragile are my lilacs (and I use the plural loosely), the gossamer weight of a butterfly made that single limb bow like a fiber-optic strand in one of those kid toys that change color. I fumed through the window glass. Shook my fist like a crusty curmudgeon growling at kids to get off his lawn. \"Get off, you lout! You great humongous beast! You leviathan of the lepidoptera world! You crushing behemoth! You obese insect Ten Ton Tessie overfed arthropod!\"Okay. I admit that I was a bit out of control. But I was NOT foaming at the mouth. The lack of vigor in my sweet, sweet lilac limb was evident when the wind came whipping off the front four acres. The little lilac flagship was tossed violently by the gusts. The butterfly rode it like a champ, but was thrown after the eight seconds were up. He may just get a big belt buckle for his trouble.My lilac bush, on the other hand, is not going to win any awards.

Give me one of those.\"\"But that's the set I wanted the most! I don't want you to have one of those. Here. Take one of these.\" Let the record show that I had four five-dollar tickets, two of one kind, two of another.\"No. That's the one I want, right there. Give me the second one.\"I put Genius's five ones in the side of my purse. He commenced to scratchin'.\"Hey! That ticket is a loser. I didn't win a thing!\"\"Too bad, so sad. That's why it's called a LOTTERY. Not every ticket wins. And you're NOT getting a refund.\"\"Come on. You took my last five ones. I need ones. What if I want to go to a strip club?\"\"Nope. You're a loser. And your dad would be quite proud to find out you've been to a strip club.\"\"He has no idea what I do. I can't believe you won't give me my money back.\"Later in the afternoon, when Genius and friend had moved their development operation to the darkroom on the other side of the wall of my dark basement lair...I scratched my remaining three tickets. \"Hey! Genius! I think you picked the wrong ticket. Look at this.\"\"WHAT? Are you kidding me! That is so unfair! Really? FIVE TIMES FIFTEEN DOLLARS? That's seventy-five dollars! I could have had seventy-five dollars!\"\"Uh huh. You had a one-in-four chance, but you had to pick the tickets I didn't want you to have. You could have had a one-in-two chance, if you'd taken a ticket I WANTED you to have!\"\"Don't rub it in. SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS!\"\"Well, I suppose that's karma.\" Yeah. How's your butt feel after that karma bite? I suppose he shouldn't have scoffed, \"I don't really care about any of the people I graduated with\" when I told him he'd never guess who was working at my credit union now.

Nobody wants to wake up to screeching monkeys.I will admit that I was the mastermind behind the plot. I was actually just doing my duty. Parking lot duty, in fact, from the day before. I had some sleuthing to complete. A bold scoff-rule driver has been motoring up the wrong parking aisles. I believe it is on purpose. Two weeks in a row is no accident. How can one be so totally oblivious to yellow arrows painted on blacktop? It's as if someone knows the right way, but deliberately chooses the wrong way. A motorized nose-thumbing, if you will. So I cast my line with the names of riders who were picked up by Wrong-Way Club Cab. I described the vehicle.My left-hand gal, Tomato-Squirter, declared that she would boldly strut to the table of the riders, and ASK who picked them up. No nuanced finagling in that one's style. I argued that she could NOT simply strut over there and interrogate two in front of six others. That would let them know that something was afoot. We are quite outnumbered, you know. Sometimes surprise is the best tactic for information-gathering. We bickered back-and-forth for a few moments. My right-hand guy tried to worm his way into the mix by informing us that the very first YouTube video was now ten years old, and was called \"Me at the Zoo.\" The fact that he is not a math teacher is glaringly evident, if you know anything about this video. Deflecting his pronouncement with a flick of the wrist, like a bothersome gnat, we continued our heated debate.\"I also saw that one guy go up the last row the wrong way. He had traffic for the softball field backed up. I don't know his name.\" I tried to describe him in my best Seinfeld movie-goers description. \"'New kid, skinny jeans, thinks he's cute.' Can you believe nobody knew who I was talking about? And he drives a black truck. NO! He was NOT a parent picking someone up. He had backed into the last row, like all the trucks, and went up the wrong way on purpose to get out faster.\"\"Oh, that's Pretty Boy. In fact, I call him 'Cute.' Because I told him, 'You think you're cute, don't you, and he said, 'I AM cute.' I'll ask him if he went the wrong way.\"\"I don't think you should be doing that here in the cafeteria. Wait until they walk by in the hall.\"By this time, the boring-talkers had stopped their discussion of...um...don't know, don't care. They were dying to know what we were talking about. They leaned forward, open-mouthed. We could have easily put them on the case to identify the swimming-upstream culprits. Perhaps for a cup of sherbet, a drink of Coke, a promise to serve a day of duty. Because our conversation beat theirs all to not-heaven.That is how it's done. Whisper-argue, and glance furtively at your intended canaries. Whether you make them sing or not is immaterial. It's the interrogation, not the confession, that drives us, that piques our curiosity.

Some things are in my domain, like the money, and other things are in Hick's domain. Like bending a twisted key back like new.Over Easter weekend, Hick asked Genius how his key worked. I stuck around for the answer. \"I'm guessing it did, because I did not get a charge of $150 on your student account statement.\"\"Actually, it worked, but I didn't want to take a chance on it every time, so I told the front desk that I locked myself out, and they gave me the spare key, and when I took it back, I gave them the twisted one.

Devie wound down into blessed silence.That little act of euthanasia accomplished, I put the tech tower back like it was and turned to take attendance, and cue up my textbook DVD for the projector, so we could hear the automated reader until I stopped her to emphasize important concepts. Don't worry. The textbook DVDs play through my laptop. The one I just fixed on Thursday, so it now charges to 100% when I leave it on the dock.I introduced the lesson, explained a photograph, hit the icon to goose that reader into action...and silence deafened the room. WE HAD NO SOUND! What a monkey wrench that was! A conscientious volunteer began reading for us, while I fiddled about with my wires. I had a blue light on my sound amplifier. So I knew it had not been unplugged. I turned it off and back on. That sometimes works, you know. And I noticed that there was no crackle and pop like I'd been getting upon turning it on for months.From past troubleshooting, my card-catalog mind pulled out the drawer concerning frayed copper wires screwed into a green plastic doodad on the back of the amplifier. I turned my tech tower 90 degrees again. Uh huh. The frayed copper of the red wire had come completely out of the green doodad. The frayed copper of the black wire held fast.Our dear reader had finished the section. We discussed salient points, then I handed out the assignment. I called the office to see if they had a small flathead. The secretary told me I could come look at her selection. Au contraire. Not with a classroom full of high-spirited young learners. She asked if I had anybody smart to send in to choose my tool. \"I don't know. Let me ask. Hey! Are any of you smart?\" Three kids raised their hands. I went with the second one, since the first had forgotten her book this very day, which I think constitutes not winning the Smart Award on this occasion.Tool-Fetcher brought me three humongous flatheads. I sent him back, with instructions to go down to the technology building for a better selection. He returned with just the right medicine. While he was gone, I showed half of a set of twins my severed copper, and discussed my plans for reconstructive surgery.\"Oh. I think, Mrs. Thevictorian, that instead of taking the whole green doodad off, you only need to unscrew that vertical screw right over the opening for the red-wire copper frays. Then you just screw that one down.\"When my new surgical instrument arrived, I handed it to Helper. He had a bit of trouble straightening out the frays flatly, but soon had them installed in their slot. \"There. I'm pretty sure that will work.\"\"Here. Let's test it. CLEAR! Get your hands off those wires. I'm charging the defibrillator. Wouldn't want to give you a shock.\" I turned on the amplifier. I thought I detected the tiniest of CLICKS from the speakers mounted on the front wall. I clicked my DVD textbook reading icon again. VOILA! Text to speech! \"Hey, kids! The sound works! Now we can read it all over again!\" Let's just say they were less than enthusiastic. Though they DID brighten up when I informed them that now they could watch five minutes of the Simple Machines video I had loaded from Learn 360.Yes. Mrs. Thevictorian has solved THREE technology issues since Thursday. So what if she had a little help from a ninth-grader today. Can kids under 18 sue for a portion of the Nobel Prize? I don't think so.I'm cleaning off a shelf for my future Nobel trophy."}, {"title": "Mine is Not to Reason Why, Mine is But to Eat and Die", "date": "Monday, April 21, 2014", "text": "Hey! My mom is at it again!Yesterday she offered me the turkey breast carcass to take home to my sweet, sweet Juno. \"He can have it, can't he? You give him bones like that?\"Okay. First of all, after almost two years now, and her the one who \"gave\" me that pup, knowing full well it was a female, even though Genius professed it to be a male so I would say we could have it...Mom still calls Juno a \"he\" every single time her name comes up.Secondly, I don't know why Mom is all of a sudden concerned about what Juno eats, considering that the three days Juno spent at Mom's house, after being dumped off by ignoramuses at her mailbox, Juno ate exactly NOTHING. Because Mom thought if she didn't feed that tiny puppy that was too young to even be weaned, that it would A) learn to hunt and feed itself, or B) leave Mom's house and go to the neighbors across the road.Thirdly, it's probably not a good idea to give a turkey breast carcass to a dog who lives with a real live turkey and (allegedly) pulls approximately fifty tail feathers out of the turkey in the driveway next to the garage while we are gone to work.But Mom is a giving soul, so I told her that yes, I would take that turkey breast carcass home to Juno. \"Where is it, in the fridge? I'll get it when we pack up our stuff to go home.\"\"Oh, no. It's out in the garage.\"\"Mom! It's a hundred degrees in the garage! That's going to stink.\"\"Well, it's not in my car. Just in the garage. And it's inside a big baggie. Gallon size.\"\"Last year, when you gave it to me a week or so after Thanksgiving, your turkey carcass, which had been INSIDE the FRIDGE, stunk so bad I almost passed out on top of Juno when I unwrapped it.\"\"Oh, it's not that hot out there. It will be fine.\"As luck would have it, I went off and forgot Juno's carcass. Mom decided last night, on our bedtime phone call, that she would drop if off at school today before we started home. I was caught up with my work, and planning to leave within fifteen minutes. The Pony went out to the car to get his laptop, and got the carcass from Mom to put in our T-Hoe. He said Mom didn't want to come in, since we would be leaving shortly. Huh. Best-laid plans. I discovered some homebound work clogging my mailbox, and decided to get that graded and recorded. Then I had to ready some new assignments to send back. So it actually took me about a half hour before I was ready to leave.\"Hey, Pony. That carcass is going to stink up the car by the time we get out there.\"\"No it won't. Grandma put it in a cooler.\"We hopped in T-Hoe. There was no odor. Good for Mom. I stopped for gas. We had to wait for an available pump, because the price had gone down TWO CENTS PER GALLON since yesterday, and of course the pumps were jammed by bargain hunters. I sent The Pony in to pay. He grabbed a soda to go with the Domino's pizza he wanted for supper. It's Hick's bowling night, and I was having leftovers from yesterday's feast. Traffic was heavy along the boulevard by the gassing up place. We waited. We puttered along the back road by the lake to get to Domino's. I missed my left turn light in town because the car in front of me had the audacity to wait for a left turn into the drive-thru liquor store parking lot, thus blocking my lane before I could whiz through that light. We picked up The Pony's pizza. We stopped for the mail. We admired a new NO TRESPASSING sign on our gravel road, all routered out on dark wood, with the letters painted yellow. We paused in the driveway for The Pony to point out that the remains of my goat-decimated lilac bush sprout had tufts of leaves that made it look like a just-trimmed poodle. Then we pulled into the garage and gathered our belongings.\"Hey, Mom. I'll come back out and get Juno's carcass. Here. Do you think you could carry in this ham?\"\"HAM? Where did you get HAM?\"\"Grandma brought it for you. Since we were leaving soon, I just left it in the car.\"\"HAM? Are you sure it's not for the dogs?\"\"No. It's for you. For sandwiches, Grandma said.\"\"So that ham has been laying in this black car in the sun ever since Grandma came to school about...oh...NINETY MINUTES AGO?\"\"Uh huh. But that's okay. She said it was. Because it's ham.\"\"And you didn't think to put it in the cooler?\"\"No. Grandma just handed me the baggie of ham. She said the cooler was for the carcass.\"As the full horror sinks in, let me further state that yesterday, after dinner, when everything else had been put away, Mom said, \"Do you think it's okay to leave out that ham? It's wrapped in foil.\"\"No, Mom. I think it should go in the fridge, too. You don't know when people will want to eat again, or others will drop in.\"She grudgingly put it away. Seriously. I know the pioneers let their hams hang in the woodshed for months. And that flies might have lighted on them and done their no-good fly business of propagating their young. And that pioneers did not have refrigerators. And that pioneers carved away the mold and still ate that ham.Val is not a pioneer. Right now, that ham is in Frig alongside yesterday's ham that I brought home straight from the refrigerator at Mom's house and put away immediately. Or IS it?Hick hollered down before he left for bowling and announced that he had fixed himself some ham and potato salad and deviled eggs.I'm not sure which one of us was Mom's target."}, {"title": "A Hot Time In the Old House Today", "date": "Sunday, April 20, 2014", "text": "Excuse me while I wipe my brow with an old red bandana pulled from the back pocket of my overalls, and wring out the sweat in order to wipe the other brow. Oh. Wait. That was my grandpa, after a scorching August day of working in the cool underground lead mines until 3:00, then weeding the upper garden, hoeing a hill of potatoes, twisting some fat red tomatoes off the vine, then plucking some roastin' ears from the lower garden garden for supper, as Grandma turned the chicken pieces frying in the cast-iron skillet of Crisco, and sizzled bacon for grease to pour over the greens she dug out of the yard, so she and Grandpa could have a sit-down meal together before she hustled off to her night job as an aide at State Hospital Number Four.What I meant to say was...I am just now recovering from the heat stroke I suffered silently at my mom's house for Easter dinner. Don't get me wrong. I LOVE my mom. She's a selfless lady, sometimes even slipping me five dollars here and there, who never complains, and would do anything for her children and grandchildren.I, however, take after my father. I cannot change my spots. I am never happy, unless it's while I'm in the midst of ranting about some real or imagined slight or stroke of misfortune. That's my nature. I apologize half-heartedly to all the Pollyannas who would wish to be my Professor Henry Higgins and turn me into a cockeyed optimist. Not gonna happen. I bear the instigators of my misery no ill will. It's me. Not them. That said, let's get on with our story...What a beautiful day we had here in our secret, secluded section of Missouri. The sun shone brightly, grass was at its greenest, a few puffy clouds in the sky, and a temperature of 81 degrees. Perfect, right? Perfect for hunting Easter eggs outside, if one so desired. Perfect for travel, like Genius back to college. Not perfect for eating the main meal in the house that baked the ham and turkey with no air conditioning to cool the kitchen eating area.Oh, there was nothing WRONG with the air conditioning. Mom just doesn't like to turn it on before August. It's a game with her every year. \"It doesn't really get that hot. I don't notice the heat. I'm comfortable downstairs.\" Uh huh. Except we were not downstairs. We were in the kitchen. I couldn't stand the heat, yet I couldn't get out of the kitchen. Are you crazy? That's where the FOOD was!Mom knew it was hot in her house. When we arrived, we saw that she had opened a kitchen window. Yes. A kitchen window. But she had not put up the storm window. And Hick found the other one stuck shut by the black rubber weatherstripping. So we had one window half-way open, with no cross-breeze because Mom's front door is a glass storm door. She brought up a little fan thingy that looks like a post that rotates. After the prayer, after we all filled our plates, as we were sitting down to eat, there was Mom, lugging an ancient box fan from the basement, through the family room, up the steps, through the kitchen, into the dining room where the grandkids eat. Poor grandkids. They had a window, but when they offered to open it, Mom said, \"That window has never opened since we built his house back in 1970.\"Oh, she knew. Why in the world she could not just flick that thermostat from OFF to COOL, I'll never know. You'd think she woulda had to prime a pump, go to the icehouse and sweep sawdust off a big block of lake ice, tear off the roof shingles, or saw a hole in to floor for sucking cool air up from the basement.What is with these septuagenarians? Seventy-eight degrees is too hot for a full meal at a family gathering. It's not going to break the bank to run the air conditioner for three hours on Easter Sunday. Not that Mom doesn't have the money.

I was, however. allowed to run wild, run free from the time school let out in May until it resumed in August. Seven homes adorned our block, and five of them housed children in my age group. Sometimes we were a roving gang, all for one and one for all. Other times, it was all-out war, boys versus girls.Guys can be so BARBARIC! Like that time the young Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals smashed the clay pottery we girls had worked so hard to craft, digging clay from the creek bed, sorting out the pebbly bits, shaping bowls and vases, and painting them with watercolors. Yes, left on the end of my patio to dry, they were mere shards when we returned from a trip to town. There was none of this Twitter-feuding and lawsuit-filing and bullying-claim nonsense that fills the news these days. We simply vowed revenge, and found a better place to cure our pottery.One activity in which we joined forces was downhill racing. Not that there was an actual race, mind you. The concrete sidewalk was only wide enough for one vehicle at a time. We took turns, and used the distance traveled and the magnitude of the crash to judge speed. The race started at the top of the hill in front of my grandpa's house. We provided most of the vehicles. Bikes were left at home. They were for street-riding.The favorite racer was a pedal-car fire engine, with wooden ladders on racks on each side. Fire Engine was not fast. It had a built-in coolness factor. It was grand to ride on, but did not steer well. Perhaps because the rider on the back sometimes caused the front wheels to lose contact with the sidewalk. The big red tricycle was also popular, because it went fast (as long as the person on the seat held their legs out from the pedals and let them spin), and the one riding on the back could stand comfortably, yet jump off before a crash. The smaller, blue tricycle was a single-rider vehicle, and lacked the handlebar streamers of the big red one. The daredevil contingent preferred the Radio Flyer, once red, but picked up at a garage sale sporting a coat of baby blue. Blue Flyer was tricky. You had to coerce a smaller passenger to sit in the front, then give it a big push and jump in like a bobsledder, wrapping your legs around the passenger, and grabbing the steering column out of their panicked clutches.The racetrack itself would not meet today's OSHA standards. Lining the left side were assorted yards, some with a little drop at the edge, some with a hill that could act as a ramp for sending a racer into an inadvertent barrel roll. Running parallel, on the right flank, was a ditch. Not just any old ditch. An open sewer ditch. That meant nothing to us, of course, kings and queens of our eight-year-old world, until we hit ninth grade and attended the consolidated high school, where we learned that our town was called \"Sewer City.\" Which was only a little bit more pleasant than \"Moosec*ck, our other nickname.At the bottom of the hill was a culvert. It was kind of like this, but with only one opening, a stream barely as wide as the tunnel, and houses on each side. Oh, and no men standing on top.Of course there were no rails, nothing to keep a kid on a fast-moving downhill racer from careening off the side. And to encourage such careening, the concrete of the sidewalk was all broken and crumbling where it passed across the culvert. That's why we made a habit of yanking hard left into Lewis's yard just before we reached the culvert. That, and what lay on the other side of the culvert...THE HOUSE OF FANNY HUGG!In all likelihood, her name was probably \"Fannie.\" But not in our eight-year-old minds. As you can imagine, it was a rite of passage to stand in front of Fanny Hugg's house, and chant her name. Seriously. What eight-year-old kid can resist hollering \"Fanny Hugg\" with glee? It's as good as yelling, \"Who FARTED?\" instead of inquiring, \"Did somebody let a stinker?\"Various styles were employed. The girls usually giggled, and said in a conversational tone, \"Fanny Hugg, Fanny Hugg, Fanny Hugg!\" The boys took it several steps further. Sometimes they turned and pointed their own fanny at her house, even slapping their cheeks for emphasis. On occasion, if one felt particularly full of himself, he might run up her sidewalk and put a foot on her porch before shouting her name! Of course he darted back to the safety of the public sidewalk immediately, before Fanny Hugg could open up her door. We were certain she could not harm us on public property.Fanny Hugg did not hesitate to let us know of her displeasure. She was probably in her early forties, maybe even late thirties, but to us, she was ancient. And old hag. Old bat. Old witch. A kid-hater. Nobody EVER went a-knockin' on Fanny Hugg's door at Halloween. Even if she had put on her porch light to entice us, we would not have gone. Whenever I heard the story of Hansel and Gretel, I thought of Fanny Hugg shoving kids into her oven. Fanny Hugg had short kinky hair like she had just given herself a Toni home perm and not combed it out. She was not an attractive woman, being short and stout and pale and thick-eyebrowed. She stopped short of shaking her fist at us, but she had that you-kids-get-off-my-lawn attitude. \"Go on home now. Leave me alone. Stay out of my yard.\" A simple request, really.Of course we could not leave like that. \"It's a free country. This sidewalk is public property. We can stand here if we want to.\" Yeah. The guys. Their mouths writing checks that Fanny couldn't cash. We WERE on public property. What was Fanny Hugg going to do? She couldn't call the police for such a miniscule offense. She couldn't turn the hose on us. She couldn't grab us all by the ear and march us home. If she had come out to knock on our doors and talk to our parents, we would have followed her, mocking every step, the boys most likely acting like apes and picking imaginary lice from their armpits to toss into their open mouths for imaginary chewing.Fanny Hugg knew we had her number.I don't know why we delighted so in tormenting that poor woman. She kept to herself, and only wanted to peep out her venetian blinds to watch the world go by without looking over a throng of barefoot kids with sticky trails of melted cherry snowcone juice down their dusty bare chests. The boys. Not us girls. We were shirted, and not dribblers.Fanny Hugg, I apologize for the angst we generated. I know how you must have felt.

So I figured something was wrong, or she'd done something she wanted to confess. First I thought perhaps she had backed her Blazer into a garage support. Or let workmen into her house without checking their credentials. I was not so much concerned about her health, because I knew she did not have a doctor's appointment, and she exhibited no cuts, no bruises, no blood, no limp.Mom has been wanting to dump her cable provider. She has her phone, TV, and internet all through the same company. Now she's got a bee in her bonnet because some big change is coming up. To hear Mom tell it, they're going completely digital, and will have a thousand channels. Mom does not want a thousand channels.\"I have not been happy with them for quite a while. I am going back to AT&T for my phone, and getting DISH Network for my TV, and only keeping the cable for the fast internet that The Pony likes.\"\"Mom. You don't have to have a thousand channels.\"\"Well, that's what it said. I have enough trouble with the ones I have now. I don't know the numbers. I click through to get to what I want. It's bad enough with 50 channels.\"\"Mom. You can program your remote for the ones you want. I'm sure Genius could do it when he's home.\"\"No. I'm going to see what AT&T has. I might even get internet from them, too. I'm going over to the store to talk to them and tell them what I want.\"That was on Monday. As you might imagine, the plan did not quite solve Mom's problem.\"I don't know any more now than when I went over there. This man was very nice, but he had no idea what I wanted. And he kept asking me what I paid my cable company. Then he said he'd need to see my cable bill. and I thought, 'He doesn't have any business looking at my cable bill.' So I told him I'd think about it, and I left.\"\"Huh. He's probably wanting to see what you paid for cable, and offer you a plan for a few dollars less.\"\"I think so. Why else would he need to see my bill?\"Today, Mom was all flustered. \"I just came by to tell you what I've done. I called DISH Network to see about getting a dish installed for my TV. I told them how much you like yours, and we went through everything that I need, got it all set up, and then the man asked for my credit card information. So I told him, 'I don't have a credit card. I'm not going to pay by credit card. I want to get a bill in the mail and pay it by check.' But he kept saying he couldn't give me an account without a credit card. So I told him he would have to, because I don't have one. And he said, 'Don't you have a daughter?' And I told him yes, that I would talk to you, and he said he would call me back this afternoon.\"\"Yeah. That's how they are. It's probably about the receivers.\"\"Yes. He said he needs a credit card so they can make sure I return their receivers. But the more I thought about it, the more I think, 'Why should YOU be responsible for my DISH bill?' And I'm just going to tell him that he must not want my business very much if he can't find a way to get me service without a credit card.\"\"It's not that I don't trust you, Mom, but I don't really want your account linked to my credit card. If you really want it, I'll do it. But I just want you to know I'd rather not.\"\"Oh, I agree.\"\"They can send a man out with the dish and the receivers, and he can take a check. Or cash. Then their receivers are paid for. If they really want your business, I think they can find a way. What they really want is a credit card so they can automatically charge you every month for your service. They've tried for years to get us to do that, and I won't. I want that paper bill, and I'll pay it and know when it's been paid. Not risk an 'error' where too much is charged, or too many months, or their accounts are hacked, or some other little problem. OnStar and SiriusXM Radio try to do that, too. Nope. Not for me. I make them bill me, I write a check, and I've been getting my service. I'd barter with them for a basket of eggs if I thought I could get away with it.\"\"Well, I just wanted you to know, in case they call you, that I did mention that you already had DISH.\"\"Great, Mom! Now they know I have a credit card! If they call me, I'm going to say, 'I never heard of that lady. She's trying to scam you.' I'm sure that will help you get your DISH. This is like when we went to get Genius his first iPhone. We waited about an hour in that store, then got the order all written up, and they wanted my credit card. I told them I was paying cash. Nope. Can't take cash. Can't take check. Can't take debit. Credit card or no iPhone. I used my credit card, because it was for Genius, and he was almost starting to cry after waiting so long for an iPhone. The old man and lady with the other clerk got to that credit card point, and the man said, 'Forget it!' and they walked out. I wished that was me.\"\"I am going to find a way to get rid of my cable some way. But when that DISH man calls me back, I'm going to tell him never mind.

Did you get that? Genius was seeking MY input on INFORMATION. Uh huh. I'm not as stupid as I used to be, it seems, when he lived under my roof.The information needed concerned how to fill out a W-4 form. Genius has an RA position locked up for next year. Not that it pays in cash, just a pittance each semester, with the big payoff coming in room and board. Still, he needed a W-4 and proof that he can work in this country legally. He also has a summer job lined up in the city. This is where it gets dicier. He will be making $20/hour, 40 hours/week, for most of the summer. His total earnings will be just under the amount that requires filing a tax return. So...he wanted advice.I do taxes for the Thevictorian family, but Hick is more knowledgeable on the W-4s. I always consult him when one rears its head. So I had Genius in my left ear on the house phone, and Hick in my right ear on my cell phone as he was driving home from work. Let's just say neither of those two can take a hint. Can conform to social cues. Like waiting until a person is done talking to put in their own two cents.It started out all right. \"Genius, I'm going to ask your dad. Just a minute.\" Then after Hick's input, \"Okay. Let me tell him.\" That worked for about two sentences. Then I felt like Larry Kroger, Pinto to his Animal House buddies, upstairs with his supermarket girlfriend, an angel on one shoulder, a devil on the other, both talking to him at once.

By his standards, anyway. He has managed to get under my skin TWICE! Okay, thrice if you count this morning when I blamed him for the fitted sheet pulling off my side of the bed because he wallows and spins and wraps up in it like a burrito every night, and he had the audacity to proclaim, \"I ain't done nothin'! I'm just layin' here!\" I find it hard to believe that a wanna-be magician wandered in overnight, stood at Hick's side of the bed, and yanked that fitted flannel sheet from under us like a fancy linen tablecloth from under the china and silver at a four-star restaurant.Next cat out of the bag, I caught Hick dragging a trunk under the porch. Okay, that's not as sinister as it might sound. Technically, Hick's oldest son, a regular adult wearing overalls and starting to look like Hick, drove that big tree trunk across the front yard in his truck, and backed it up to the front porch, where he and Hick dragged it out and put it at the corner by the downspout, near my rose bush.I questioned Hick as to the thought processes that went into putting an old rotting tree trunk up under a wooden wraparound porch on a cedar home. Hick seems to think that his very special tree trunk that he dragged from the creek is not full of termites that will delight in a smorgasbord that will keep their family fat and sassy for generations to come. \"There's no termites in that tree trunk! I got it out of the creek! You could see them if there were termites in it.\" So sayeth the self-appointed termite inspector. I'm waiting for him to adorn his very special tree trunk with an eternal flame that licks just shy of contact with the bottom board of the porch.Hick made a shocking discovery on the way to the creek to get his very special tree trunk. We have surprise chickens! Three newly-hatched chicks, which were not expected yet, even though Hick knows he has hens sitting, just not where, or for how long. He usually catches one sitting in the chicken house, and stuffs a couple of days worth of eggs up under her. From that point, it takes 21 days for the little peckers to bust out. Hick wants to put them up in a separate pen until they are a bit bigger, but he can't catch the momma.Oh, and according to Hick, \"YOUR DOG TRIED TO EAT MY CHICKS!\" Yeah. Right. My sweet, sweet Juno trying to eat fluffy fresh baby chicks? I don't think so. Upon further interrogation, Hick reported that he caught Juno SNIFFING THE NEW CHICKS. \"She had her nose right up against them!\" Um. That's what dogs do. Sniff things. Other dogs' anuses. Men's crotches. Groceries set on the side porch to await carrying in by a 16-year-old. Just-hatched chicks. Dogs don't eat everything they sniff. Laws, no! M-O-O-N. That spells we'd be in a world of trouble if dogs ate everything they sniffed, because other dogs would have no anuses, and men would have no crotches, and people would starve to death.I will not believe Juno was trying to eat baby chicks unless I discover her with tiny feathers clinging to her gums, and three chicks seem to be missing. TRYING to eat baby chicks? If she wanted to eat them, they would already be eaten. Hick is not so powerful that his gaze falling upon her in the act would stop my sweet, sweet Juno from chickicide.I'm sure Juno will be Hick's best friend when he grills steaks later this evening. I hope the deck does not collapse under them due to weakening by termite jaws."}, {"title": "A Scratch-Off Tale From the Gas Station Chicken Store", "date": "Saturday, April 12, 2014", "text": "Val has had many unique adventures here in Backroads. Many unique adventures involving fellow customers at establishments she frequents. Indeed. She has been caressed by a woman in Save A Lot. Had her buttocks molested by a geezer's arm in the dead-mouse-smelling post office. Was propositioned by a ZZ-Top-bearded, Daisy-Dukes-wearing man of questionable oral hygiene on the parking lot of Walmart. Had a roll of cash thrust at her by a friendly, generous, inattentive man while boxing her groceries at Save-A-Lot. Suffered verbal overfamiliarity from a dude who yelled, \"That's ever man's dream!\" when she asked for two breasts and two thighs at the gas station chicken store.And it's the gas station chicken store that calls us back today. The scene of the latest indignity to befall our heroine, Val of Backroads.Perhaps I've mentioned that I do not have a fondness for other people's children. Unless I am responsible for them in a supervisorly educational role, I have no interest in them. Seen and not heard. There's a reason for that idiom. It was not coined by idiots. I would like to coin my own idiom. \"Children should be left outside in a well-ventilated car with proper adult supervision, and not brought into convenience stores.\" Not quite so catchy as \"seen and not heard.\" But quite as serviceable.I had stopped in for a 44 oz. Diet Coke and a scratch-off ticket. Yes, I DID win, as a matter of fact. Fifty dollars on a ten dollar ticket. But I didn't know that until later. Because, you see, I was fighting for my life against an eight-year-old girl in the gas station chicken store. Or at least for my hide.A man was already at the Coke machine. He looked at it, and moved on down the counter towards the back cooler, to the coffee machine. Had he asked, I might have suggested something stiffer. But Val is not one to give unsolicited advice to strangers in convenience stores. That guy had three little girls with him. They all called him Daddy. Stair steps, they were. I'm guessing 8, 7, 6, though I am not well-versed in the sizes and cognitive skills of youngsters much under the age of 12.The girlies swarmed around those three aisles like a working drug-sniffing canine, an ant checking out a dessert buffet, and a goldfish in a just-tapped aquarium. DaddyO seemed a bit frazzled. Eight suddenly appeared to my left, at the section where one orders gas station chicken, though the kitchen was closed, it being only 10:00 a.m. She eyed the plastic-lid-covered tray of donuts. \"I never saw a donut for only eighty-nine cents, Daddy.\" He sighed and pressed the lid onto his coffee. \"Well, then, you must not have been in many convenience stores.\" The other girlies swarmed him and grabbed his legs, asking for assorted treats. I moved on to the counter with my refill.A new clerk was training. Her minder left her to go in the kitchen, perhaps to drop a batch of chicken. The characteristic aroma did not yet permeate the store. Trainee was slow. She had to look up the price of a refill. She had trouble tearing my scratcher ticket off the roll. DaddyO and his brood were behind me. And beside me. I daresay I'm lucky they were not up in my buttocks like that post office geezer's arm.The minder came out to the other register. \"Can I help you over here?\" DaddyO stepped up. That, to his litter, was an invitation to belly up to the short counter. As if they, too, were paying customers. DaddyO had caved, and was buying them a bag of chips to share. \"Five dollars for a bag of chips?\" The minder was not helping the situation. I'm thinking his total was five dollars, not just the chips. But that is neither here nor there, because Eight was HERE. Right under my left armpit. Jostling me. Bumping me. Stabbing me with her youthful elbow that had not yet acquired a cushion of fat to soften the jab of skin-over-bone. I moved away. She followed, as though attached by a safety chain.Twice more she jabbed me. Then she commenced to scratching her angular elbow. AND SCRAPED SEVERAL FINGERNAILS WORTH OF SKIN OFF MY PLUSH OLD-LADY ARM! I've endured less damaging swipes from my ungrateful garage-peeing cats.There needs to be a law. Like...kids under 16 must be carried through stores by their parents. That would be much safer for victims like me. What if some mishap were to befall that child over the next 24-48 hours, and Val's skin cells were found under her fingernails? I could be framed for ne'er-do-well-ness!Yeah. There oughta be a law."}, {"title": "You're Not Getting Older, You're Getting Tireder", "date": "Friday, April 11, 2014", "text": "Val is tired tonight, my friends.

There was road resurfacing on two of the three ways I can get there. The third way is really not an option, miles out of my way, through territory of which I am unfamiliar. I guess I could do it if it meant losing my job. But it didn't, so I took the second of the two work zones. Val does not like disorder and change. It's draining.Just walking from T-Hoe on the school parking lot into the building proper was a Herculean task. Halfway up the sidewalk, I wanted to lay down in the newly-sprouted blades of grass around the downspout. Who would know? Besides everybody watching me on the camera, and those faculty who pulled up after I sank into a Rip Van Winkle slumber. I was as drowsy as Dorothy in a field of poppies. It was as if Morpheus himself had hopped onto my back and wrapped his arms around me.

How he does it at all with those stubby fingers and thumbs is beyond me.So I sent him that text, just to check on him. You never know when he might suddenly forget to breathe in and breathe out.

I got several days out of school for that one. We didn't have a phone, and my dad was blind, and my mom was in the hospital...so I just got up every morning and went and sat in the woods until time to go home.

All textbook and no shenaniganning make for a very long school day. We use a science magazine periodically throughout the year. Think of your Weekly Reader, only all sciency, and for high school students. The kids like it because they learn many new things from current happenings in the world of science. I like it because it always has a balance of the different branches, and it relates stories to the major concepts we cover.Normally, I challenge the class to beat my score in an online science Jeopardy-style game. I answer all questions without ever opening up the magazines. Then they get a chance. Occasionally, one class might eke out a victory. Not often, though, because Val is, after all, a professional. A jack-of-all-science-branches. (Shh...I can't use that kind of expression around the kids). There is no truth to the rumor that I am now pitting student against student because I can't take a trouncing. As if!!! I even scored a perfect 400 on this week's issue.We played two preliminary rounds, and then a championship match and a consolation match. I have every student's name on a colored index card. I use them throughout the year to pick students to answer questions, to put them in groups for labs, and to choose partners for collaborative learning. For the teams, I discussed the rules while shuffling those cards over and over. Then I deal out four stacks, face down. Because I know how kids will react, I first preface each card-partnering session with: \"Let's remember that we will not show excessive emotion. No euphoria. No despair. These are not your life partners for eternity. They are your 40-minute partners for this one day. Now here are your teams...\"Kids will try to infiltrate a team with their buddies. So I read off a whole team, and tell them where to sit. Then I watch them go to that spot. You can't let them mill or mingle. I name the teams, because I do not recall fondly that day when a team chose \"The Narcoleptic Otters,\" and one sleepy aquatic weasel asked, \"Do you know how to spell that?\" as I wrote the name on the board. Puhlease! What valedictorian cannot spell otter?\"This team is the Doors. You will sit by the door. Next, we have the Pencil Sharpeners. You will sit by the Pencil Sharpener. No. You may NOT be the Windows. I can see right through your little plan. I choose the names here. Okay, back here in front of my desk, we have the Desks. Uh uh. You are NOT Bookcases. You are DESKS! Embrace your Deskness. And over there, in the last corner, are the Microwaves. You know, in front of the microwave. Has everybody got it?\"It took a few moments for the teams to decide on official spokesmen and a number between 1 and 60 to determine opponents and game order. The Pencil Sharpeners bluntly declared that they were not all that sharp, and they were a bit concerned about going up against their rivals, the Doors. \"But Mrs. Thevictorian! How fair is that? The Doors are open to many new opportunities. And we are just dull.\" After being told not to knock the Doors, the Pencil Sharpeners settled down to grind out a victory.The Desks went about their match in an upright, workmanlike manner, with their feet planted firmly on the ground. They knew their opponents, the Microwaves, were really cookin'. As luck would have it, the three top brains ended up on the same team. One of the questions was, \"Which has the longest wavelenth: X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or microwaves?\" The Microwaves got it right. \"We knew that answer, Mrs. Thevictorian! We knew that question would come up, and that we would get it right. Because WE are the Microwaves!\"FYI:A limnologist does not study tree limbs.

This is the neighbor my mom said she would NOT take food to, even if he was blocked in by that fallen tree, because \"He has a wife!\" And therefore deserves to starve, or can use her as a Donner snack.\"So, did that man ever get the tree out of his driveway?\"\"Not exactly. He's been working at it. I feel sorry for him.\"\"Not sorry enough to lend him your chainsaw.\"\"No. I don't even know if that chainsaw works.

I don't think he'd like that very much. He takes care of his yard.\"\"This guy must be from the city, moving out here without a chainsaw. He probably thinks that the Czech's yard is just the woods. It is kind of overgrown from that driveway to his mowed yard.\"\"I think he left it that way so he wouldn't have to see the people on the other side. I don't like it that the man can sit on his porch and look over here at me. I don't like to work in the yard when he's out.

I heard Hick stumping through the laundry room to feed the dogs on the back porch. I heard Hick stumping back through the kitchen to where the microwave was humming with a sausage biscuit in its innards, a sausage biscuit wrenched from Frig's freezer, along with a bottle of water snagged from the fridge area beside the lunches I'd already prepared for The Pony and myself.

On the counter!\"\"Don't worry, Mom. He found it. I think he was laying out receipts for me to deal with after buying gas yesterday. I know. Yeah. Nobody's happier than me that he found it.

One of his scholarships had to be renewed at semester, which he forgot about, since it had not been mentioned since last spring when he applied for it. He was mysteriously awarded a new scholarship in January, for the same amount, so we were not out any hard-earned cash. I had interrogated Backroads school personnel in an effort to track down a contact person and address so Genius could communicate with this organization in February, when he realized his error of omission. Luckily Genius found the info in his records, because nobody at school knew nothin' 'bout no scholarship, other than the new liaison (name unknown) would be there sometime between February and May to pick up this year's applications. Genius called and left messages, and sent the packet of grades and documentation. He never heard back, so we figured he has out of luck, and had learned a valuable life lesson. On March 31st, the scholarship money showed up in his student account.That check was a pleasant surprise. It also meant that I had to leave my dark basement lair on Saturday to drive it to our place of savings and deposit it in one of Genius's college accounts. My mom had let The Pony sleep over, and was going to drop him off at bowling league at noon. That meant she couldn't accompany me on this trip. I called to see if she wanted anything. She said no. I guess now that her driveway is passable, my Meals on T-Hoe's Wheels program is no longer needed. Still, I took Mom some leftover fried rice, sweet & sour sauce, crispy sweet things that are free and nobody here likes them, and a box of Fiddle Faddle I bought in Save A Lot. Oh, and I brought her a fish sandwich because they were two for five dollars at Arby's. I did not expect her to give me anything in return. But you know my mom. She's such a giver!Mom came out to the driveway to grab her stuff. We were both rushed for time. In her hand, she held a folded-up bill of indeterminate currency. She waved it around. \"I know I owe you more than this...and I'll get it to you sometime. But I read in the paper about those teachers at your school hosting The Extraordinary Dance, and I wondered, if I give this to you, can you give it to them for a donation? I think it's great that they're doing something like that, and I saw how they're having more expenses this year, and I wanted to give them something.\"\"Sure. I'll give it to them. I have lunch with one every day.\"Mom handed me a five-dollar bill. To her, this means a lot. She's from another era. From a time when she threw her shoe out of the car window, and had to go around with one shoe until her lead-mining father could afford another one with credit at the company store. It really comes from the heart.This morning, when The Pony and I went on our weekly grocery-shopping trip, I saw the folded up five in the back hidey-hole area of my purse. \"Oh, tomorrow morning, don't let me forget to take in this donation grandma gave me for The Extraordinary Dance.\"\"Okay. Just what is that, anyway? The prom?\"\"No. It's like that, but a month later. And it's for the extraordinary kids. The ones who go to extraordinary class. Who have learning issues. This might be the best night of their high school lives. We've hosted it for years, and invite other schools to bring their students. They love it. They look forward to it. There are so many this year that the sponsors are getting the word out that they need donations. One of our teachers has agreed to make all the food. Grandma gave me five dollars to give them.\"\"FIVE dollars? Only FIVE dollars? That's nothing!\"\"Grandma thinks it is. She's from a time when five dollars could get a lot. And she really wants them to have it. I'm going to explain to them how much it means to her. I'm sure they will be thrilled to get it.\"\"Can I give them some money?\"\"Sure.

Val is as attractive as one of those electromagnets that dangle from a crane and lift crushed cars at the junkyard.The fair opened at 7:30 a.m. Kids had until 9:30 to get their projects set up. My students were riding the bus with our middle school entrants to conserve resources. The Pony and I headed directly to the fair, per our normal morning routine. We arrived at 7:26. \"Let's just sit here a while and make sure the doors are open. There's no rush. Our bus won't be here until after school starts.\"\"No. I'll go in at 7:30. It's open. They shouldn't say they're open if they don't want people here that early.\" The Pony uses logic as a weapon. I managed to stall him until 7:38. Then I drove him to the circular drive so he didn't risk paragliding in the heavy winds with his project board that would not tri-fold after his addition of a plexiglass triangle to represent a prism. I returned to the lot and parked T-Hoe.Just as I suspected, The Pony and I were the only people in the field house besides the fair director. I picked my seat (heh, heh, I picked my seat!) so I could see my entrants once they were set up. The trick is to stake out the front row of bleachers so you're not mixed in with the kids during the awards, and you have leg room, and can come and go as you wish. Plus the uninterrupted view down to the floor. I spread out my coat and bag of science fair accoutrements along the bleacher, to save space for my two colleagues who were accompanying the bus. I was the lone attendee for a good 30 minutes, until a bus from another school arrived.I had just returned from the display floor after picking up my list of projects. I sat back down at the end of the bleacher, my coat still sprawled like a lioness in the sun digesting a meal. The sponsor from the just-arrived bus walked past me AND SAT DOWN ON THE VERY EDGE OF MY COAT!You've gotta be kidding me! ALL that space, not a single soul other than Val in that whole audience, and he sat right on top of me. Plus, he had brought some work to do, it seems, because he edged the edge of my coat back towards me, and plunked a teacher text on the bleacher. But that's not all! An acquaintance of his arrived on the next bus, and she walked around the other side of the field house and approached from the right. Passed Creeper while chatting, pushed my coat so that it wrinkled like a Sharpei pup, and PLUNKED HER BUTT DOWN BETWEEN ME AND HIM!So...there were only us three sponsors in the entirety of the whole building, and we occupied a ten-foot section of one bleacher!

Their sponsors accompanied them to the floor. By the time our bus arrived, and my colleagues joined me, there was no room at the end.\"I've been saving these seats for you. Unsuccessfully. I feel like Elaine at the Paradise Twin. 'Saved. Taken. SAVED! These seats are SAVED!'

I had forgotten all about this failed attempt until I read of blog buddy Tammy's recent success.I submitted a little tale to Reader's Digest to enlighten folks about MY day's work. Since I was teaching at the time, and we didn't have cool uniforms or any uniforms or barely even a dress code...I couldn't submit to Humor in Uniform. So All in a Day's Work it was. Actually, I sent two (failed) tales, but the other one will have to get in line.I don't remember how I told it then. I'm sure it was bare-bones, and conformed to the proper word count, and was dry as not-heaven. But below is how I'm telling it now. Along about my eighth year of teaching, I worked at a little smidgen of a school nestled in the foothills of float trip country. Most of the faculty was from the local area, with many spouses employed at various grade levels. Every now and then, a teacher would move on, and a new one would join our ranks. At the back-to-school inservice day one August, our middle school principal looked around the library at his current crop of educators. We were all women, except the principal himself, and the husband of one of our our sixth grade teachers.\"Well, Bob, it looks like you'll be in hog heaven this year.\"Bob put his palms on the edge of the brown laminated table, and tilted his library chair back. He turned his head to the left, drank in the human scenery, swiveled his gaze slowly around the room to his right, and said, \"Ya got THAT right.\"Ahem. I don't think Bob was making a statement about our beauty.

Every time we see a video or read about any kind of critter, she crows, \"It's so CUTE! I want one!\" Except for snakes. And, surprisingly, turkeys. Because she's such a lover of animals, I'm going to call her Philanimal. Near the end of class today, she approached my desk.Philanimal: \"Did you know you have to be 18 to buy a duck, Mrs. Thevictorian?\"Val: \"I did not.\"Philanimal: \"I didn't either, until I went to buy one yesterday. They were SO cute. And they were only four dollars. I took one up front and said, 'I want to buy this duck.' And the lady said, 'I can't sell you that duck. You have to be 18.' Can you believe that? I can drive a car. I can see an R-rated movie. I can move out and live on my own. But I can't buy a duck!\"Val: \"Where was this?\"Philanimal: \"At the pet shop in Backroads.

But I'm glad to you tipped me off on the legal age to buy a duck. Too bad somebody called to tell on the auction my husband used to go to on the edge of Backroads. He could buy and sell animals there all day long. He got chickens, and a turkey, and rabbits, and goats. No duck, though. But he knew a regular there who used to buy a duck every couple of weeks. She was Chinese. It was not going home with her to be a pet.Philanimal: \"Ohh...that's sad.\"Val: \"Well, it's a fact of life. Besides. That lady WAS over 18.\"I don't want to put false information into the blogosphere. I wondered if maybe that duck rule only applies to Missouri. We have exotic animal regulations, you know. So I consulted my BFF Google. Surprisingly, I did not find any statutes prohibiting under-eighteeners from buying ducks. I even read about the Missouri Duck and Coot Regulations.

Though Hick did not sayeth it in so many words, just in snide little comments interspersed with my glowing tales of Juno's latest brilliant acts.I might have mentioned once or twice how Juno greets me on the side porch every evening when we get home from school, and how we have an intense reunion, a two-legged/four-legged lovefest, where I hug her and whisper sweet nothings while she lays her head on my shoulder or upper chest, and gazes into my eyes with her almost-human amber orbs.Last week, Juno, in mid-lovefest, GROWLED at Ann the simple-minded black german shepherd with the muddy brown eyes that signify nobody's home. Ann was merely shouldering her way in front of me for a pat, all the while whining in her anxious way, which seems to be a standard warning that the sky is falling. The Pony was just around the corner, unlocking the kitchen door. But he came back. \"We tried to TELL you Juno is evil. You've created a monster!\"Well. I beg to differ. My sweet, sweet Juno? A monster? I think not. She just wanted me all to herself. There's not enough love to go around. And Ann is always stealing Juno's special house on the back porch mere feet from the kitchen door, where treats can be tossed directly inside to prevent sharing.Since we moved the cat feeding roasting pan of kibble out of the garage and onto a shelf on the side porch, Juno has been discombobulated. She used to love running under the garage door and stealing a accidentally dragging her mouth across the cat kibble for an accidental bite before I had T-Hoe pulled in properly. Now she crouches down and scampers in, but looks puzzled and sheepish and goes back out to wait for me.Well. I feel a little bit guilty. Juno is a black silky ball of energy. She burns a lot of calories. Unlike Ann, the matronly would-be bonbon eater. So after our lovefest, I have started reaching up into the cat roaster and giving Juno a handful of cat kibble. If I forget, Juno looks at me. Turns her head to the cat roaster shelf. Looks at me again. Walks to the shelf and puts her nose up against it. Looks back at me.

Don't mind the run-on sentence. He was a psychology teacher, for cryin' out loud, not an English teacher.Let's call him Dr. Bobo. He was quite partial to tossing the Bobo doll (figuratively, of course) into daily discussions. However, this one day, he got onto the subject of child development, and how there are ages and stages that human babies go through. And how parents of course think their child is the most brilliant, most beautiful creature ever born.\"Parents come up to me and tell me how advanced little Johnny is. How little Susie is surely the next Einstein. I know they're proud of their kids. I don't want to call anybody a liar. I don't want to embarrass them, or make them feel bad. One lady was so excited. 'Dr. Bobo! My son spoke his first words the other day. He's only six months old. I walked into his room to pick him up after his nap, and he said, May I have a cookie, please?'\" \"Now, I knew a six-month-old baby would not speak like that. What could I say? What would YOU say?

Now put on your seatbelt.\" The Pony clutched 'Little Bear' to his shoulder, a stuffed bear he'd scammed from the top of my Valentines heart. Genius made many laps through the front yard, up the driveway, across the front field by the sinkhole, down past the barn, and back through the front yard. Hick and I didn't think anything of it.

Because we all know an oil painting ain't safe in a house full of Hicks. Much better to let it take its chances in a suite shared by 4 boy-men who will appreciate it properly.The child safe that has a combination but doesn't lock was returned to the homestead for proper documentation. Hick LOVES for his junk to be featured on my blog. His GOODWILL junk, people. Stop tittering. I'm not talking about that junk housed by his tighty-whities. Though he would probably enjoy that junk being featured as well. Hick has no shame. And no sense of reality.The child safe is now locked. Only not really. Because any turn will open it. So nice, I showed it twice.As you can see, our ample butts have not been plopped in those porch chairs all winter. Porch chairs, which, of course, were not bought retail or wholesale, but picked up from my grandma's estate auction.And now, the star of the show, the mysterious one-armed chair only used twice by a teenage boy in Backroads, USA. It's not like the boy needs that absent limb. He's left-handed, you know. So why would his left arm need to rest like a lazy lay-about right arm? The back of the chair is mesh, and Genius can lean back like a quasi-recliner. I don't know if the chair is meant to do that on purpose, but Genius says it's comfy.\u00a0 We had to move it away from his built-in desk lovingly crafted by his father, because its position in front of his double window caused a glare on the phone camera. And seriously, that green wall behind his built-in trophy shelves actually DOES go with his monochromatic gray stripe theme on the other two walls. That's because his sheets are that same chartreuse hue. Genius is much more artsy than the rest of us. Just don't choose him for your team in a Pictionary tournament, because his strength lies in photography, not pencil sketches. In fact, his walls are covered with more photos (snapped by him) than the backyard shed walls of Russell Crowe as John Nash in A Beautiful Mind.Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go break the news to Hick that there will be no cabbage juice in his future, for his new-found bargain gadget is not a cabbage juicer at all, but a less-exotic potato ricer.

There's an O. Henry vibe there.Hick took Friday off so he could go Goodwill hopping with Genius. They headed for the city, because everybody knows city people have better junk than country people. Hick is always on the lookout for old-timey gadgets, beer and Coca Cola memorabilia, and chickens. Genius is in the market for an office chair to replace the one he got for $20 and took to his dorm room, and for cameras, lenses, and accoutrements that he can resell for a profit to fund his expensive photography hobby. He also has Hick trained to bid on these items at auctions.The Pony and I had Friday off because it was parent conference week at school, and we stayed late two nights. We went about our day paying bills and visiting with my mom. I left The Pony with her to spend the night, and went back home to await the return of the Goodwillers. Genius had dropped Hick off for a doctor's appointment on the way home, and went to buy a new pair of shoes because his stink. While whiling away time in the waiting room waiting to be picked up, Hick sent me a cryptic text.\"We hot u a prize.\"\"Oh, really. You hot me a prize?\"\"Yeah. Got y prise.\" He's not the best typer or texter.\"I hope it isn't Auction Meat.\" In case you have forgotten, Hick bid on a box at the auction one night that was simply marked \"meat,\" but the price went too high. THANK YOU, Even Steven!\"Goodwill Meat.\"That was enough for me. I refused any further communication. When the guys got home, I heard a crinkly sack. I thought perhaps Genius had picked up some fast food, since both had said not to prepare supper for them. Then Hick came into the living room with the sack. It was my surprise:A BAG OF GUS'S PRETZELS!Never mind that I can't eat a whole bag of Gus's pretzels. It's the thought that counts. Oh, and Hick ate one on the way home. But that's not the big news. Hick had to tell me of the bargains he and Genius picked up.\"We got a cabbage juicer...\"\"What? Who juices cabbage? Are you sure that's what it is?\"\"Well, that's what your grandma told me it was when I used to go visit and saw hers. And we got a kitchen knife...\"\"Who buys a kitchen knife at Goodwill? We have knives. Your company MAKES knives!\"\"It has a bone handle. And we got a round-ended shovel...\"\"For what? To whack those roosters that jump at you and dig their spurs into your belly, like when you sent that little banty checkerboard rooster flying with the blue plastic snow shovel?\"\"To use for digging, like when something gets one of the chickens. And we got a painting not on canvas but on a board, that Genius wanted...\"\"Maybe there'll be a great master under the painting.\"\"Maybe. And we got a pair of needlnose pliers...\"\"Those always come in handy, even if you already have about 100 pair.\"\"Yeah. And we got a kid's lock box...\"\"Can you get it open? Does it have a combination?\" \"It has a combination, but you don't need to know it, because it works with any numbers, you just turn the dial and it opens. And we got two Oreo Coke tins...\"\"Oreo COKE tins? What's that?\"\"I mean Oreo tins. And Genius found a chair! An office chair for his room. It's a really good chair, too, even if it IS missing an arm...\"\"WHAT? Genius bought a chair with one arm?\" Just then I heard Genius wheeling his prize through the kitchen. He pushed it across the living room carpet and plopped down, resting his right arm on the chair's lone limb. He sighed and leaned back.\"It's really comfortable, Mom.\"I couldn't stand it any more. I was hee-hawing like a madwoman. \"I can't believe you guys! Why do we need this stuff? I'm not juicing any cabbage, or shoveling chicken graves, or locking my valuables in an unlocked box, or stabbing people with that shiv of a kitchen knife, or framing a painting, or collecting Oreo memorabilia. And that pressure cooker is just going to put us on the watch list! But I will agree that except for missing an arm, that office chair looks like it's in good shape.\"\"Wait!

I hate to bring this up. You all know how Val isn't one to complain. How she's a rah-rah, overly-optimistic, glass-is-half-full, silver-lining-finding ray of sunshine who occasionally shoots rainbows from special structures in her wrists like Spiderman shoots web. But I can't hold it in any longer. I try not to talk about work here most of the time. I need the advice of cooler heads. Folks on the outside looking in. I'm curious if my teacher friends will see the situation differently (that's not a good omen--I typed \"differntly\") than the laymen.I think The Cleaner is out to get me.The Cleaner has been with us for a couple of years now. The Cleaner replaced a kindly custodian who was great at visiting during your plan time, driving people home if a snowstorm overtook us, and would give folks the shirt off his back, and kids at the ballgame a dollar for snacks. The Cleaner is a bit more high-strung. A bit more conscientious about the duties entailed by the position. That is not necessarily a bad thing. Surfaces gleam. Dust screams and scrams when it sees The Cleaner coming. You can almost hear the theme song from \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\" I'm not sure, but I think, after hours, that The Cleaner may patrol the halls with a holster holding a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser on each hip. If The Cleaner was a cleaner...The Cleaner would be Fantastik.Let the record show that the old custodian always told Val her room was the best one to clean. Yeah. I'm sure you think he said that to all the teachers. But I'm sure he was being honest with me. There were hardly ever any paper scraps on the floor. No candy or gum wrappers. No broken pencil pieces or spitwads. Every now and then we had a mudder. And occasionally there would be a dirty spot on the tile from when somebody got a bit overzealous with the Germ-X, and the floor blob gathered grime from passing soles. Every day seventh hour, I had my students straighten the rows of desks, lining them up on tile lines, and push in their chairs. This is my 26th year of teaching. I run a tight ship.Three days last week, upon arrival at 7:25 a.m., I noticed that my furniture had been repositioned. This has happened intermittently throughout the year. The problem with this is that I must move 25 desks and 25 chairs back to their original positions. Students creep, you know. By the end of the day, those desks are two tiles off front, and two tiles off back. A tile is twelve inches. So we're talking two feet closer to the board, and two feet closer to the back bookcase. In the back row, students sprawl. They rear back and stretch their legs. Backpacks hang on the seat backs. We are hard-pressed to squeeze through the educational accoutrements piled about the pupils.I know that The Cleaner knows where my desks and chairs go. They are lined up right more often than they are moved. On those three days in a row, the tastefully shoed feet of my desks were exactly four inches off each designated line. No, I did not measure. My discerning eye can judge 1/3 of a tile. That made the back row of the four rows a whole tile farther back. A foot off. That means the only way around the room is across the front. That is not ideal. One must constantly move, like a shark needing oxygen flowing over its gills to survive, in order to keep one's finger on the pulse of the classroom.Growing tired of moving 25 desks and 25 chairs each morning, I entertained the thought of putting my furniture four inches forward each evening in order to make a point to The Cleaner that just that little bit of fudging makes a big difference in functionality. I put that thought on the back burner, because really, have you ever tried to teach 25 freshmen to unlearn desk feet positions and relearn new ones? Didn't think so. Then on Thursday, only the back row had been moved. There was a letter on my desk asking if we could discuss setting the desks farther apart, in order to facilitate dry-mopping. Let the record show that this configuration has been in effect at least four years, and a dry-mopping problem has never been mentioned before.Val may be an overbearing blowhard, but she does not like confrontation. Nor does she like to see anybody's job made harder by her own doing. To place the furniture in the new configuration would be a hardship on Val for seven hours a day, less one plan period, and perhaps make The Cleaner's job a bit easier for 10 minutes per day. It's not like the desks are a toothpick-width apart to start with. There are two feet between chair feet. The short dust mop fits. The old custodian didn't even break stride as he went up and down the rows. Sure, sometimes he had to swish that mop sideways to grab an errant dust bunny, but the configuration was eminently doable. In addition, Val makes sure that on mopping day, which is different every couple of weeks, denoted by a note on my desk, that the kids stack the chairs on the desks, and move them farther apart so the legs don't snag the shoulders of The Cleaner. AND Val and The Pony put those chairs down the morning after mopping, and move all the desks into proper position.Not wanting to overstep my bounds, I showed my building principal the note, and asked if I needed to adjust my furniture. He shook his head. Said that The Cleaner had brought up the matter with him, and that he told The Cleaner to ask me. Huh. I was tattled on by The Cleaner! For desks that have been in the same position for the whole time The Cleaner has worked here!What you may not know is that The Cleaner also opens and scrubs my personal microwave, and has been known to put the caps on all my pens that I leave out on my desk overnight. When I told The Cleaner that a new desk design would not work for me, and commented that they are the same as they've been for four eyars, The Cleaner grew defense, and declared that since the beginning of the year, The Cleaner had wanted to bring this up. Oh, dear. Val is the bad guy for wanting her classroom to remain arranged to suit her needs.It has gotten to the point that Val is somewhat afraid to cross The Cleaner. I don't want The Cleaner cleaning my microwave, and probably also my mini-fridge, but I'm afraid to say anything. Thursday, the students were dismissed at 1:00 for parent conferences. Teachers spent time working in their rooms until parents showed up. The Cleaner had my room swept, microwave wiped, and trash dumped by 2:00. HELLO! Val cannot go four hours without making trash! I have to blow my nose, you know. Especially after the vigorous dust-mopping while I was in the classroom. Then there was that half-bottle of Dr. Pepper left over from Tuesday's conferences. And the can of Beanie Weenies I brought to tide me over because nobody was bringin' pasta at 3:40 like on Tuesday.Here's how bad it has become. Rather than throw my trash in the wastebasket like a normal person, I sealed up my Beanie Weenie can in a ziploc sandwich bag left over from lunch, and stuffed it in a Walmart sack with my used tissues and Dr. Pepper bottle and sugarless gum wrapper, and CARRIED IT HOME TO THROW AWAY!

I think I heard the clerk at the convenience store cackle that threat at me last night. I can't be sure. I was working up a good mad, so the blood pounding in my ears might have prevented proper auditory signals from reaching my brain.I just ran in for a minute. To get The Pony a Sprite in a bottle. We had called in a pizza on the way home, after The Pony's academic team practice going over by a half hour. The Pony prefers to eat his pizza in the car while it's hot. Since he has a chauffeur, nothing really stands in his way. But he does request that Sprite to wash it down. I'm selfless like that. Stopping at a convenience store just to get my Pony a drink.Since I was stopping anyway, I saw no harm in grabbing a 44 oz. Diet Coke. The fountain is right there, you see, on the way to the register after picking up a 20 oz. bottle of Sprite from the cooler. As luck and schemin' Even Steven would have it, I was without a refill cup. So I strolled in empty-handed. Oh, and I forgot the Sprite.The clerk was that kind of hateful old lady who says all transactions out loud. She glanced up as I came in the door. I think they're trained to do that, in case maybe I'm an escaped axe murderer bent on mayhem. She had one customer at the counter. He was soon gone as I stepped up to the fountain and pulled a cup. The Wicked Witch of the West looked at me, then busied herself by poking her flying monkeys under the counter with her broom handle. Or something. I stuck my cup against the metal dangly thing for ice. SILENCE. Not a rumble, not a clunk, not a sound. I tried again. No dice, no ice.\"Are we out of ice?\"\"I don't know. I haven't checked.\" Again with busywork, probably pinching Toto in that little basket on the floor at her feet. I filled my 44 oz. cup most of the way with Diet Coke, leaving room for ice from Frig's freezer door dispenser. Dang. Even Steven was busting my hump. I may or may not have emitted an audible sigh.I walked up front and turned in two winning scratch-off tickets. Then I bought three more. Even Steven. I did, however, pull out a twenty to break for smaller bills. \"That's fifteen dollars in, and fifteen dollars out in tickets. Is that a refill?\" I guess she was testing me.\"No. This is a new one.\"\"A dollar fifty-seven...\"\"Oh. I forgot the Sprite. I'm getting one out of the cooler.\" I walked the ten paces to the back and snagged a green bottle.\" There were still no other customers. I put the Sprite on the counter.\"One twenty-five. Is that all?\"\"Yes. That's it.\"\"Out of twenty...did you try the other machine?\"\"No. I didn't. I'm in a hurry.\"NOW the WWoftheW had the nerve to ask. She was referring to the Pepsi fountain. Which was right next to the Coca Cola fountain. Of course I would not sully my new cup with ice from a Pepsi machine! That would be barbaric. Who in their right mind would push their new 44 oz. cup under the nozzle for ice from a PEPSI machine? Not this old Val.

We only recently graduated from margarine and Cool Whip tubs.Second cat out of the bag, Hick has no concept of what makes a good leftover.

Still earlier than the Early Bird Special, but planned so we could feast uninterrupted by the after-work rush. Woe were the poor souls who have third lunch from 11:47 to 12:14. No doubt they were still stuffed from their cafeteria tray of \"pork\" chop, mashed potatoes, peas, and a banana. Too bad, so sad! More for US! The ravenous 10:53 lunch crowd.We might as well live up to our sullied reputation of scarfing down every morsel in our path, like army ants on the march. Take THAT, grazers. Leave those carbs alone.

Somebody's going to get hurt. Look out for that balding fellow with a whitish discoloration on his lip--the one who looks like Humpty Dumpty with a melon head. He might shove you down if you're an old lady with a walker. Really. There's no need to rush. I promise I'm not going to talk about feces transplants again.Remember how Hick and I decided to cast the cats out of Outer Garagia? The ungrateful fleabags with their overactive bladders were exiled to relieve themselves elsewhere. Hopefully not in a corner of the parking garage at the mall. Or in the shower at the health club. I hear that is frowned upon. That could get you arrested. Or banned. Or earn you the nickname of The Urinator.We've been feeding those foul felines outside the garage on a shelf on the breezeway. If one runs in, we shake that food pan and entice it out. Yet Hick found Genius-the-cat curled up on T-Hoe's hood the other day. And I found that fat tuxedo fellow clambering down from the rafters by way of a sideways-hung ladder with all the grace of a pink-tulle-tutued hippo auditioning for the position of understudy for a prima ballerina in Swan Lake.Today when The Pony and I opened my side of the garage and aligned T-Hoe with the slot, I spied Genius-the-cat curled up on the concrete slab of our approach. \"Hey! There's Genius! Let's get that door closed as soon as I get in, or he'll run inside and we'll have to catch him.\" Genius ran in, but The Pony shooed him out the people door to the awaiting food dish. The crank of that garage door is like a bell to Pavlov's dog to those felines. They come running, even if it means to take a bite of stale dry food that has been out since 6:00 a.m.\"Genius is out, but there's that gray cat that's been in here all day.\"\"What? I told your dad to keep them out! Why is he letting them come in when he leaves? This is never going to work.\"The Pony walked over to Hick's garage door. Bent down. Made a 'CLICK' noise. \"Well...it would help if we locked the cat door.\"\"WHAT? I told him the very first day we kicked them out, 'We have to lock the cat door.' What in the world is he thinking? They can come in and out all day! They haven't been kicked out at all!\"\"It WAS locked. But Dad unlocked it the other day. He said they needed a way to get out in case they got inside in the morning.\"At the rate I'm pulling my hair out, I'm going to need to put the wig master of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat in the #1 position on my speed dial."}, {"title": "Maybe I Could Find a Non-Murderous Sitter On Craigslist", "date": "Sunday, March 23, 2014", "text": "Genius is home for Spring Break. The problem is...nobody else has Spring Break this week. That means I have to babysit him. Not so much babysit him as in keep him from drinking bleach under the sink. He didn't even do that as a toddler. We didn't childproof for him. The biggest problem was preventing him from climbing up the refrigerator shelves to grab his bottle (yeah, he was a late weaner), and from removing the labels off 250 video tapes before stacking them to build a city. We did not succeed.Now, as then, he's night owl. Unlike then, he now takes a nap. He got home yesterday, chatted a bit, then lay down on the short couch for a snooze. A three-hour snooze. The only thing that woke him was his phone. Then he took off to soothe a friend in a crisis until 2:00 a.m. He's a good friend like that. A good boarder, not so much.On Friday, his original plan for this weekend was to go to the city Saturday, spend the night at the home of a college buddy, and then return to our open arms and open Frig. Plans changed. Seems the others making that trip decided to go to Atlanta instead, to run a marathon. Those wacky kids and their spur-of-the-moment travel plans. Genius said he had originally joined the pact for Atlanta last fall, but since he didn't have time to train for a marathon, he couldn't see forking over $500 for a trip to Atlanta to stand on the sidelines (thank you, Even Steven!) and watch.Maybe I should be careful what I thank Even Steven for. This afternoon, I gave Genius the debit card to buy us some phones. The house phones are in a sorry state, what with my office landline having a cracked antenna, besides being as big as a shoebox like Jerry's cordless in season one of Seinfeld. The one out by my basement recliner has a rattle. The one I use upstairs has static. The wall phone in the master bathroom rings no more. And the kitchen wall phone only gets a dial tone if you jiggle the wire just right. Don't even suggest that we simply carry our cell phones from room to room. We barely get reception in the living room. Forget putting any walls or floors in between that satellite signal. So...we are $100 poorer, but now have four new phones. The wall phones will have to wait until Genius finds the right units.He's going to a movie tonight. Tomorrow he's on his own. And the rest of the week, too, because we all work, and I have parent conferences two nights this week.I suppose I'll see him in passing.

The pessimist might say that people cast off their old junk for us to deal with. Garbage bags full of trash, piles of limbs from tree-trimming, old refrigerators, oodles of cute puppies and kittens, and the occasional portable meth lab. Oh. And that headless body in a septic tank.But Val, the eternal optimist, that Backroads Pollyanna, always seeing the silver lining, prefers to think of such cast-offs as unburied treasure. Okay. It's really Hick who sees other people's trash as his unclaimed treasure. And for that reason, when The Pony and I saw what lay on a flat rock in the shallow creek Thursday, we told Hick. He took off on his Gator to snag it before anybody else could claim it.I must admit that I felt a little bit guilty. Not about taking a dip net out of the creek. Laws no! M-O-O-N. That spells out here in Backroads it's finders keepers, nobody is going to drive to town with a dip net and turn it in to the police and ask to keep it if nobody claims it in 30 days. No. I felt a little bit guilty because I feared I might have sent Hick to his demise. Or embarrassment. Or a slight head cold after getting his feet wet wading a creek for a dip net.The more I thought about it, the more I grew concerned. I couldn't call Hick to warn him of my fears. Phones don't work down by the creek. You might as well be swirling down a sinkhole for all the reception you can get. I wondered if the dip net was a cruel trick. If somebody was behind a tree waiting to plug Hick like Elmer Fudd after a wascally wabbit. Or if this was a slightly humorous prank where one might have a hank of fishing line tied to that dip net, and whisk it away from Hick when he bent over to pick it up.As you can see, it was a simple case of an abandoned dip net. Which now belongs to Hick.Lesson? The land of Backroads is flowing with abandoned dip nets, free for the taking."}, {"title": "She Put a Bug in My Ear", "date": "Friday, March 21, 2014", "text": "I had the best day ever! Surprisingly enough, I was not at work!Today I took off to drive my mom to the doctor. It was just routine, nothing serious. She had a morning lab appointment. I took it upon myself to drop her off at the door of the hospital, and pick her up when she was finished. Sure, she could have driven herself and parked in the lot and ridden the trolley driven by that old volunteer guy...but she's my MOM, by cracky. And those sick days aren't going to use themselves. They will disappear faster than an egg from Hick's chicken coop if I don't take them before the end of the school year. I'm at the max allowed, you know. They're part of my contract. Val is not one to throw away benefits all willy-nilly.The thing with sick days is that you use them or lose them after 100 are accumulated. Many's the time Val has not taken a single day off throughout the year, sick or personal, and been rewarded with a thoughtful $150 check of appreciation, as put forth in the teacher handbook, from which retirement and taxes were withheld. Considering that a substitute is paid $75 per day...it looks like Val has been doing the district a favor all these years. Oh, she has tried to lessen the absentee burden even more by taking half days for appointments, only to be told, \"It's really hard to get a sub to come in for a half day. You need to take the full day off.\" So be it. So has-been it.But we're not here to talk about the state of Val's attendance. We're here to talk about my very special day. I dropped off The Pony at school, then headed to Mom's house. Where, I might add, I pulled into the driveway without invitation. We had enough time to run by my sister the ex-mayor's wife's house, where she was babysitting my niece's new baby of three months. Mom told me last night on our 10:30 phone call that I needed to go see the baby. I don't know why these folks have been harping at me. Val is not a baby person. I like the baby. I'm happy my niece has the baby. Her husband adores the baby. It's all a very sweet situation, kind of like the Alan Jackson song \"Little Bitty.\" But that doesn't mean that I feel the need to see the baby. I just saw the baby at my uncle's funeral. I swear. It was getting like that harpy screeching at Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer: \"You've GOT to see the BAAABY! I will admit, though, that she was breathtaking.Because we stopped by to see the baby, Mom was only ten minutes early for her lab appointment. We had planned on it taking about ten minutes if she got there early, and them I'd drop her off and head to a rendezvous with my best old ex-teaching buddy Mabel. Mabel is on a permanent vacation. Even though she's busy building a new house, she takes time from staining to catch up with Val. Mom did not get out of her appointment until the time I was supposed to be meeting Mabel. So we picked her up, made her ride in The Pony's seat in the midst of his hoard, to chat while on the way to Mom's house.Mabel and I had a wonderful visit. Of course we saw the entire population of Backroads pass by while we had breakfast (her), lunch (me), and took up a table for three hours. Then it was nearly time to pick up The Pony from school, so I dropped by Mom's for a half hour instead of going all the way back home.Mom's house is a good way station to while away time, providing, of course, that the driveway is not off limits due to snow. Mom was watching a Cardinals' game, but stopped to tell me ecstatically that she had received a phone call from Genius, and talked for 20 minutes, until he said, \"Uh, Grandma, I have to be across campus in class in 10 minutes.\"I grabbed four throw pillows and plopped down on Mom's long couch for a half hour. We talked. Because, you know, we only have two phone conversations a day, plus that time in T-Hoe to and from the hospital. Just before it was time to leave, I felt a tickle in my outer ear. Not that cartilaginous flap on the side of my head. The smooth indentation behind the hole that leads to the tunnel to my brain. I reached up to scratch that tickle, and MY FINGER FELT SOMETHING CRUNCHY! That should not happen, people. Ears are smooth. Warm. Little bowl-shaped depressions that abut the hole. Definitely not crunchy.Then it dawned on my what was in my ear. A BUG! A CRUNCHY BUG! ACK! RIGHT OVER THE HOLE IN MY HEAD! WITH ACCESS TO MY BRAIN! I dug. I tried not to push it farther in. I scooped at it with a fingernail. I got it! I flipped it out. I flung my arms to and fro. Maniacally. There it was! On the floor! A LADYBUG!\"Mom! I had a bug in my ear! It fell from the ceiling into my ear! A bug! MOM! A bug was in my ear! A ladybug! Yuck! Why didn't you help me? I though you would have run to me in order to assist me in removing it! But you just sat there!\"\"Oh, it's just a ladybug. Besides, you were flapping your arms so much I was afraid I would get hurt. Those ladybugs come out when the weather gets warm. They live in the attic. Look at them on the wall over there.\"THE HORROR. Mom didn't mean the attic. We were in the downstairs family room of her brick split-level home. She meant the drop ceiling. I looked where she motioned, and there was a line of ladybugs at the junction of her wall and ceiling. \"Mom. Maybe you should call an exterminator.\"\"Well, they've been here since we had that big cloud of them years ago.\"Uh huh. That was at least 14 years back. Around the time, give or take a couple years, when we had the 17-year cicada issue. Dang! I remember Mom vacuuming up ladybugs and letting them go outside. \"Mom. You need to get rid of them. When I drop in for a visit three times a year, is it too much to expect to lay on the couch without a ladybug burrowing into my brain?\"\"Oh, every night there's one that flies at me.

Blog buddy Sioux is rattling my chain!Sioux would like me to share a little bit about my writing process. Be careful what you like, Sioux. Once the genie is out of the bottle, there's no cramming it back in. Here's how this forthcoming train wreck came to be. Margo Dill linked Donna Volkenannt, who passed the honor on to Sioux, who hitched her chain to Val, who ousted the cats who won't chase rats, all from the garage that Hick built.1. What am I working on?I'm working on 44 oz. Diet Cokes, churning out two blog posts daily, one here and one on my supersecret blog, to which only a few folks are privy. Heh, heh, I said privy. I have a couple of projects on the back burner. They are along the lines of Poop My Cat Says, and The Book of Humdrum. Yeah. Those aren't real titles. I'm using \"Sh*t My Dad Says\" and \"The Book of Awesome\" as inspiration. I also have an idea for a longer work of thinly-veiled fiction that might expose the underbelly of public education. I'll have to wait for my retirement to kick in before that one sees the light of day.2. How does my work differ from others in its genre?My work differs from others by the sheer staggering unpopularity and unmarketability of my subject matter. Nobody wants to read about hillbillies going about their wacky lives in Backroads U.S.A. In fact, we are the only group that is fair game for daily derision in the media. Because we don't understand we're the butt of the joke, perhaps. Heh, heh. I said butt.3. Why do I write what I do?I write to amuse myself. To play with words. To keep from pulling my hair out in frustration for not being the center of the universe and the ruler of the world. I like to make people laugh. Or stare. I like to take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile. Wait...that was Mary Tyler Moore. I would like to be the lesser Seinfeld show: the blog about nothing. Is that frowned upon?4. What is my writing process like?My writing process is kind of like living inside a pinball machine. Anybody remember those? Or Pinball Wizard? \"She sits like a statue, becomes part of her rolly chair. Feeling out the keyboard, in her dark basement lair. Writes by intuition, her pageview counter falls. That backward uncouth gal, Val...sure types a mean old blog!\"Each morning, I have ideas percolating in my head that might become blog posts, might become submissions, might fit into the bigger picture of my much-neglected lengthier works. I sometimes grab my little spiral notebook and jot them down, but most often that's too much effort, and I swear I'll remember them, but then I head off to school to earn an honest living, and my ideas fade like the yellow butcher paper lining my bulletin board for nigh on 14 years. So I do what I do every day, Sioux...try and take over the world. Wait. That was Pinky and the Brain. I sit down at my desktop in my dark basement lair every night, read my regular blogs to catch up on happenings, respond to comments, and choose one of the multitude of mundane occurrences from my day to whip into a blog post. Two.One of these days, I'm going to stop procrastinating, make time to sit down during my optimum creative hours between six and noon, and get something done. Until then, what you see is what you get.__________________________________________________________________________And now, to distress others with this chain, like a fine piece of wood furniture made more appealing by a good whacking...I'm choosing to inject a little testosterone in the mix with two guys who drop in ever day for a round of abuse in my comment section.

And some they will and some they won't, with some it's just as well.\"Joe H. \"The Cranky Old Man\" blogs about, well, being cranky and unapologetic, issues of the day, issues of yesterday, stupid headlines, and general guyitude. He's written a couple of books, so I figure he writes. Whether he wants to reveal his process remains to be seen. Oh, and he's from exotic New Jersey.Steven Hayes \"The Chubby Chatterbox\" blogs from Oregon. He's a real renaissance man. You can get just about any kind of culture you desire from his blog, except for a gourmet brontosaurus ribs recipe. Sometimes I feel like I need to tuck in my shirt and wash my face before I drop in. Stephen shares his vast knowledge of painting, some of his own artwork, stories from childhood, travel tales that take me there better than The Amazing Race, and some classic Mom-talk every now and then. Stephen has a book in the works, and he's published several online articles, if I remember correctly. He may take the stance of those League of Their Own gals, and declare that a gentleman reveals nothing. Not that there's anything wrong with that.Leenie works in watercolors, and I swear I read some really good poetry over at her blog. Perhaps she has a book that she's been holding back. Or perhaps she'd like to tell us more about her creative process with painting and photography. She's also out west, in Idaho. I think I flew over it one time on my way to Seattle on the way to Alaska. Maybe not. I only learned that England is an island last month.And how about Lynn? What is Lynn up to these days? Is she still writing letters? Naughty Santa stuff? Is there a big project we need to know about? Do tell! I know she NaNoWriMos. What's kickin', chicken? Fill us in.

The pooper that left huge poops too big for cat anuses, poops in a puddle of pee, poops with segments like a giant Tootsie Roll log. We never caught the mystery pooper. But the cats took notes from that ne'er-poop-well. Good for the goose, good for the gander, it seems. Only this pooper was no goose. The cats began taking liberties with our concrete garage floor. Marking their territory back. Not every day. Days after a mystery poop. Carefully avoiding the previously-used area that was drenched with bleach. Short of mopping the entire garage floor with bleach, and having weirdos in hazmat suits show up on our doorstep, we've decided to rescind garage privileges.The precipitating incident was this evening. Hick arrived home first. As The Pony and I came up the driveway, he pulling our green trash dumpster the length of the long driveway like a rickshaw, and I holding T-Hoe's horses so as not to run over my little Pony, my garage door opened on its own. Then I saw Hick pushing a broom. The one we got him for Christmas. He wasn't pushing poop. He was sweeping piles of fine driveway dirt that melted off and dried during the twelve snowstorms.\"I've had it with these cats!\"\"I told you to lock the cat door. They can sleep outside now.

She's selfless like that. So when blog buddy Stephen needs partners for his (now-restituted) crime, to assuage the guilt over his spontaneous Dine & Dash, Val is there for him, eager to step up to the dinner plate and relate her own tale of a long-ago dinner-tab faux pas.Let the record show that Val is not inherently a mooch. She pays as she goes. Credit card balance paid in full each month. Money added to the principal on her house payment. A tidy savings socked away for her spawn's college fund. Val is not the type to attempt to obtain something for nothing. That's how she was raised. Val would never offer to pay you Tuesday for a pint of slaw today.Val has led a sheltered life. She tooled off to overnight-college her junior year, in a yellow four-door Chevy Chevette with tasteful tan pinstripes down the side, and a Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Richards kind of attitude. She soon fell in with a rowdy crowd in her field of study. A crowd much more worldly than she. As a weekend ritual, Val and her cohorts often visited drinking and dancing establishments where Val may or may not have imbibed demon alcohol. After such an evening, The Cohorts sometimes suggested an after-hours visit to a restaurant which we'll call \"Benny's.\" Nothing soaks up alcohol in the stomach of imbibers like a Benny's Great Bam breakfast platter.Waitresses at Benny's lost no love on The Cohorts, party of five. Much in the way cocktail waitresses at a Saturday afternoon Happy Hour shun a gaggle of girls and set down their cocktails with a thin-lipped half-smile, the Benny's staff provided cursory service. Efforts to befriend and empathize were shunned, perhaps due in no small part to the attempt of one of The Cohorts to be flirtatious. That waitress was, perhaps, sheltered, and had never been to college.The Benny's was way out by the interstate, several miles from the college compound. Val was selected as driver. Whether this honor was a function of her four-door, her sobriety, or her mad driving skillz is moot. Val was the driver. The Benny's was not busy. The Cohorts, a couple of couples, and a sleepy family were not enough to keep the staff busy. The waitress came out, waitressed, and disappeared into the back. Every now and then, another worker would step up to the register, survey the action, and re-disappear.Since The Cohorts were served their Great Bams, and never visited again by the waitress, a bit of animosity began to fester. The ring leader of The Cohorts was insulted. For wont of butter and jelly which were not forthcoming, she grew bitter. \"She didn't even bring us the check! I'm ready to go. Val, why don't you go pull the car around. I'll cover your part, and you can pay me back when we find out how much it is.\"Being such a selfless people-person, I headed past the sleepy family making their way to the register, and brought the car around for The Cohorts. Nobody wants to walk any farther than necessary after a Great Bam. Just as my trusty Chevette reached the doors, The Cohorts strolled out and piled in. \"GO! LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!\" Ring Leader was sure in a hurry to get back to her apartment. Maybe she had to poop.Then Ring Leader's roommate let the cat out of the bag. \"I can't believe we did that! We're going to get caught! GO!\"\"Great! It's my car. I'm the one they'll be after! What did you do?\"\"Um. When that family walked up to pay, we strolled along behind them, stood for a minute, acted like we were with them, and then walked out when you pulled up.\"\"Don't worry, Val. You don't owe me anything for your Great Bam!\"\"Oh, yeah. And here's your silverware.\"Yes. Val is a criminal. Though a sheltered, unwitting criminal. A sheltered, unwitting criminal who tried to stifle her cohorts every time they visited a different restaurant in the chain on the other side of town. Tried to stifle their sing-song salutations to each other in Val's car on the way to a Great Bam:\"Welcome to Benny's!

Just today, a book was left in my classroom after the final bell. My canaries were singing again, though. \"Mrs. Thevictorian! Somebody has left their book on that desk!\" Let the record show that it was not MY textbook, but that of another course. However...the leaver was one who has already lost MY textbook, and uses that of a trusting friend each day because I will not issue another until the first is paid for. \"Do you want me to yell down the hall, Mrs. Thevictorian, and tell that leaver to come get the book?\"\"Yes. By all means. I'm headed out to duty.\" I passed The Leaver in the hall. \"Oh, I see you're going back to rescue THAT book! It's too late for mine. Perhaps you're learning responsibility.\" We shall see.So all this book-abandoning has me firing up efforts to get my proposed handbasket factory off the ground. I have the most scathingly brilliant idea! A handbasket book about handbaskets! A little pocket book that you can read while you're actually in your handbasket. And it will be all about the history of the handbasket!I don't know where I cooked up that idea. Sometimes I simply amaze myself with my originality. Say...maybe the book can be shaped like an actual handbasket!See you later. I've got to clear some space on the counter of my proposed handbasket factory.

Set to detonate like a just-unpinned grenade, so swift is the outcry and the effort to get rid of that book. Their antics remind me of my old friend, whose husband asked if she was having an affair. \"I already have YOU! Why on earth would I want another one?\" Uh huh. No student is going to get stuck with TWO books. No sirreee, Bob! It's like a game of hot potato. And not at all like finders-keepers.I direct the finder to put it on a spare desk along the wall. Then I look up the number, call the classroom of the abandoner, and ask for them to come retrieve their book at that teacher's convenience. Sometimes they get downright huffy about it. How dare I ask that they take responsibility for the book checked out to them on the third day of school! In fact, some of the witnesses to the finding think that book is MY responsibility. \"You need to do something with that book, Mrs. Thevictorian. It's your book. Put it up and keep it for them. That's how books disappear.\" Apparently, I am responsible for 100 books on any given weekday.But the thing is, THEY ALWAYS TELL ME. Until today. Sure, maybe it's because this one was a library book. I suppose I am not responsible for a library book. What we really need to do in that case is call the librarian. It's HER book. She's got a lot more to worry about than I do. I cried because I had 100 books to keep track of...then I met a woman who had 2000.A student came in at the end of the day. \"Did I leave my book in here? Huh. I don't see it. I guess not. Sorry.\"\"Nobody turned one in. I'll let you know if I see it.\"\"Hey! There's a book. A library book? It's right there.\" All eyes swiveled to a desk in the last row.

A photo. Two. Kind of like a \"Wanted\" poster. What's wanted is a new home for a little doggie. I would love to have this new pet, what with the passing of our baying beagle Tank (BY NATURAL MEANS, PEOPLE!) last weekend.I know I shouldn't inquire about this little beauty, even though the phone number is right there on the wanted poster. It's too soon. I can't scoop up a replacement pet on the rebound. That's not fair to the new pet. Or the old. Besides, I don't think Hick would okay it at this time. Maybe during the summer, we can keep an eye out for the local pound puppies advertised in the Backroads Hometown Gazette. We've been a three-dog family for many years now. But this is not the time.Smiling at the camera in that wanted poster is a 5-month-old Australian Shepherd/Border Collie mix. Uh huh. Kind of a high-energy companion. We have the room for her to run, but we also have chickens that we would like to keep alive. I fear that this doggie would be unsupervised all day, and have a heyday with our fowl. It was hard enough to keep my sweet, sweet Juno from chasing chickens she was raised with from when she was a tiny pup. She still grabs them by the tail feathers when she is feeling especially frisky, and forgets we have a picture window overlooking the front yard. Only last fall we found that pile of turkey feathers and feared the worst.Doggie on the wall has her shots. I'm not sure, but I think she's had her special operation. She has a mostly black body, with that white stripe down her nose common to those two breeds. And she looks perky! Yep! Who woulda thunk a pup of that mix would be perky? The description goes on to say that she knows some commands, and IS HOUSEBROKEN! Who would keep a dog like that in the house? Not a china shop owner who stores inventory at home, I'm sure! I could imagine her as a playmate for my sweet, sweet Juno, but the timing is not right.As if seeing this beauty on the wall yesterday was not enough...this morning before school a colleague at the Kyocera saw her, too. \"What a cute little dog! But I couldn't keep it. I don't have the room. As it is now, we're trying to find a home for our beagle. We let her out to run, but she needs a big open space to run rabbits. She's had her operation. She's getting up there in years. Someone dumped her at our house. She's very loving. The problem is, she can climb the chain-link fence. Oh, she always comes back. But she's taught our other mutt to do it, too. And he comes back, but he brings things! Yesterday he had one of those solar powered driveway lights that stick in the ground. I'm afraid someone is going to complain.\"No. I can't have a beagle, either. It's too soon.

Our high school sent six competitors at each grade level. The showing was impressive. Freshman placed 1st and 2nd, Sophomores (The Pony's category) swept 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. Juniors raked in 1st and 3rd. And the Seniors hauled in a 3rd. Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, our little school won the small schools division handily. Awards are only given for 1st/2nd/3rd each grade level. So we garnered 8 of the 12 awards. Yay, us! The Pony himself earned a red-ribboned medal for 2nd place.I figured my best old ex-teaching buddy Mabel might be interested to hear that. Some of the winners are her proteges. That information is simply too lengthy for me to text her. Ex-job well done, Mabel.The rest of you might see it as too much bragging on my little den of learning, but by cracky, we're good enough, we're smart enough, and doggone it, people need to stop belittling us as Backroads hicks. Our school has a history of being the little uncool loser enclave, way back to the days when I was valedictorian at a bigger, cooler, winner school. We are a school of distinction, by cracky! And I'll say by cracky whenever I feel like it. We are Backroads. We are proud.The team left this morning and stopped for breakfast on the way. The Pony said he had a sausage biscuit, which for him is a substantial meal. Good thing. The team went to KFC for lunch. The chicken buffet. I might have mentioned that you could count the foods The Pony eats on one hand, if it had six fingers. He's not adventurous in the sustenance department.\"What did you have at KFC?\" Let the record show that Thevictorians never go there.\"All I had was some biscuits and mashed potatoes.\"\"That's it? That's all you ate from the buffet? Biscuits with butter, and mashed potatoes with gravy?\"\"No. Just biscuits. And mashed potatoes. I HATE chicken!\" Said the boy who eats chicken nuggets, planks, strips, tenders, tenderloins, lemon-pepper breasts, Shake 'n' Bake breasts, Sweet & Sour, patties, chunks, and sandwiches. Seriously. Chicken is one of his six food groups. What he meant, I think, was that he does not eat REAL chicken with a bone in it. Maybe he's lazy, like his brother before him, who once brandished a leg and demanded, \"WHO PUT THE BONE IN MY CHICKEN?\"Maybe The Pony didn't want to put himself in the midst of a feeding frenzy. I can only imagine 24 high school students at a fried chicken buffet. The image that comes to mind is the scene in Gremlins where Billy looks at the unplugged clock, thinks it's safe to feed his hungry new Gizmo offspring, and hands them a plate of leftover fried chicken from the fridge. You've seen it, right? How the bones fly through the air, strings of saliva fling willy-nilly, and at the end there's a big BURP. I suppose The Pony is lucky to escape with all his limbs intact.Forget carb-loading for marathons. Forget fish as brain food.

His actual league doesn't start until 12:30, but he orders lunch and gets in a few practice rolls.I thought there would be time to do the weekly shopping yesterday and still have The Pony ready for bowling league on time. We made a stop at Save A Lot, and headed on to Walmart. We made good progress, The Pony fetching outlying items while I combed the main food section. The Pony grabbed my tabloids as I chose a check-out, then left to spend his two-dollar bribe on one of the racing games. It was only 10:30 when we came out and loaded the back of T-Hoe with our provisions. A cold rain had begun to fall, and the temperature had dropped from 41 to 36. As I started to record my purchase on my checkbook register, The Pony, my back-up eyes, said, \"I think this car is waiting for our parking spot.\"It was a good one, too, the first parking spot after the three handicapped ones on our aisle. I dumped my receipt and debit card into the slight indentation on top of the console, and turned the ignition to back out. \"I can see the car now. Let me know if any people get in the way. By the time I hear T-Hoe's warning sounds, they'll be flattened.\" The Pony assured me that my reverse path was clear of pedestrians. I hoped he was actually turned around looking, unlike that time he let me slow-speed collide with the front bumper of that agitated meth-beard dude at the bank drive-thru.As we left the chaos of Walmart's parking lot, The Pony said that he would rather pick up some fast food than eat at the bowling alley. I took him through Burger King for a chicken sandwich combo. We were pulling into the gas-station chicken store to pick up my 44 oz. Diet Coke before the knowledge of my epic fail in shopping-day protocol hit me: I HAD FORGOTTEN OUR GERM-X CLEANSE.\"PONY! We forgot the Germ-X! Here! Give me your hand!\" I flipped the top of my mini green-apple-scented squeeze bottle. \"Here!\"\"Ugh! I'm EATING now!\"\"But you need Germ-X! What if you lick your fingers?\"\"Umm...it's too late. I've already licked them so many times that Germ-X now won't matter.\"\"No! Do you know how many people have touched that steering wheel on you driving game? Who knows what kind of bacteria was on there? What if somebody drove it from a culture that wipes their butt with their bare hand? And you licked you fingers!\"\"I'm safe.

Hick was lounging about in his La-Z-Boy, and The Pony sat on the long couch ready to assist me in gathering our provisions.I always check for any overnight comments to publish, and then catch up on breaking internet news. \"Oh,\" I asked Hick, \"did you read about those teachers who called the prosecuting attorney because they didn't want to be shot with pellet guns?\" Hick is always up on the latest local news. I think he gets bored searching for beer company memorabilia on eBay all day. I had forgotten that Hick was off work Friday. So of course he hadn't received his dose of current happenings.VAL: \"There was an inservice drill, like we had last semester, about active shooter training. Except nobody shot at us with pellet guns. Our trainer asked for a volunteer to be a shooter, and gave him a fake gun, and he gave us clown noses to throw at him. Not real clown noses. Little soft red balls that looked like clown noses. The point was that anything thrown at you when you enter a room will take you by surprise and disrupt your aim, and give several people a chance to whack you with chairs and staplers and spray wasp killer in your face and jam pencils in your eyes and ears while everyone else runs out of the room. A few may die, but it buys time for everyone else. Yeah. It was so uplifting. So anyway, at this other school, they were shooting at teachers with pellet guns to make them terrified so they would move faster. They said it would be more realistic, but there were no students there to save that day.\"HICK: \"A pellet gun? They don't hurt. Genius has one downstairs. Pony! Go get that pellet gun and we'll shoot Mom.\"The Pony rolled his eyes. Then he pursed his muzzle and looked at the ceiling. \"Hmm. Nah.\"VAL: \"I'd like to thank you, Pony, for taking time to mull over that scenario before deciding not to shoot me. That just warms my heart. You really DO love me.\"PONY: \"Actually, I was rolling my eyes because I can't believe Dad said we were going to shoot you.\" HICK: \"We'll shoot you, too, Pony. It's not that bad.\"VAL: \"Then why did they have to put on protective goggles?\"HICK: \"Well, you don't want to get hit in the eye. That might hurt you.\"VAL: \"So you're telling me that you could get away with that at work? You're on the safety committee. You go to those SHARP meetings. You think you could have a safety drill and shoot at your employees with pellet guns?\"HICK: \"No! They'd have a fit and sue us. In fact, OSHA wouldn't allow us to do something like that.\"PONY: \"Yeah. That would not be good. Shooting pellets in a building with machines all over the place.\"VAL: \"THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! It can't be done with factory employees, even though there are more workplace shootings than school shootings. It isn't good for machines, but it's good for TEACHERS? Everything if fine to do to teachers. Anything goes. The comments on that article are all saying that teachers should be shot at with pellet guns, or they won't try to save kids in a real emergency. That they should be fired if they don't want to be shot at with pellet guns. They're missing the point that you can have training without shooting teachers with pellet guns.\"Maybe I should look into a career as a machine operator.

To leave her political hat hanging on the heavy wooden coat rack just inside the door of her mother's brick split-level abode. Why take a stand when sitting on the sidelines is so much more comfortable? But today, Val must say this about that.I found out at the faculty lunch table that my colleagues see nothing wrong with being shot at work! Really. We were discussing news of recent days, and the subject of a local school district's inservice program came up. Four teachers called the courthouse to complain that they did not want to be hit with plastic projectiles from an air-powered firearm. That they were calling the prosecuting attorney to find out their rights. The school canceled the drill when officials learned of the complaint. A spokesman for the district stated that teachers had several chances to opt out of the training.Here's my issue. We had an inservice presentation on such a scenario. Nobody shot us with plastic pellets. I think we still got the message. Do we bring in those swamp boats with giant fans to blow fake wind down the hall during our tornado drills? No. But we understand the urgency, and know where to go. Do we set off smoke canisters and crank the thermostat and flash strobe lights like crackling flames during our fire drills? No. But we understand the urgency, and know where to go. Do we blast cracking-crumbling noises and rattle windows and doors and knock ceiling tiles loose and tip over bookcases during our earthquake drills? No. But we understand the urgency, and know where to go.I think that district crossed the line. If their faculty was given opportunities to opt out, why didn't they opt out? Why did they find it necessary to seek guidance for possibly filing a complaint? What's the point of scheduling this simulation if all members are not expected to participate? I smell something fishy.The articles says this training was in response to recent legislation:According to the Missouri Revised Statutes Section 170.315, which established the Active Shooter and Intruder Response Training for Schools Program (ASIRT), \"each school district and charter school may, by July 1, 2014, include in its teacher and school employee training a component on how to properly respond to students who provide them with information about a threatening situation and how to address situations in which there is a potentially dangerous or armed intruder in the school. Training may also include information and techniques on how to address situations where an active shooter is present in the school or on school property.\"Notice that it says MAY include. Not MUST include. Nowhere does it mention that teachers must be given eye protection and shot with an Airsoft gun's plastic pellets. Yes, by all means, run drills every year with the students and teachers, just like the tornado, fire, earthquake, and intruder drills. Even call it by its name, Active Shooter Drill. Actually shooting the teachers seems to be taking it a bit far. For those who cry that this is to make the situation realistic...let's remember that the students are not there on inservice day. So how realistic could it be? Who are the teachers trying to protect?At our lunch table, my colleagues did not feel this was inappropriate. They were of the belief that those pellets wouldn't hurt much. No harm done. It was just a drill. I'm sorry. I refuse to be the frog simmering in the pot while the water boils, not noticing my slow demise. I choose to be the frog dropped into that boiling pot, and jumping out immediately because I know something is wrong.Something is wrong when drills are held using teachers as targets for real projectiles. Wake up! Let's get hoppin'. Next they'll be making us shoot back.We are teachers, not targets. Teachers, not hired guns.Here's something scary.

And I seriously doubt that the dude would be suing the casino if he got drunk and won $500,000.Then there's the 18-year-old little gal who left home in a disagreement over rules, and now has taken her parents to court asking for $645 a week in support, plus her private school tuition, and a college fund.

If she's read them already, she can give those to him as well. According to The Shoveler's wife, The Shoveler really enjoys those magazines. As she told Mom, \"He can't wait to read them and find out who's gay this week.\"Mom has been communicating with one of her best old lady friends from her high school days by email. The friend was worried about Mom during the ice event. \"Do you have your firewood inside? Do you have enough food? Do you have water to flush the toilet?\" Funny what people consider necessities. Mom has three toilets. I think she could even go without flushing for a short time if necessary.Mom assured her friend that she had plenty of food, that her box of firewood was still there since the last storm, and that she had jars of water in the basement. WHAT? That's news to me! What is she all of a sudden, a prepper? I know she has several gallons of drinking water. She uses it in normal times, because she doesn't like the taste of the hard water from the faucet. I had no idea about the jars of water in the basement. What's that all about? I need to get to the bottom of that. I wonder if it's in her old Ball jars from when she used to can pickles and assorted veggies.At least water in jars is not as dangerous as that bag of clothes she had sitting around in her garage, just waiting for her to back her Blazer in and jam the hot tailpipe into it. I might need to inquire about that as well. Like if it's still there.

Oklahoma has nothing on Kansas, the flatland state, home of my dear college crony-in-crime and former roomie, Bean.I went to Salina one summer, and complained to Bean, since obviously she was the official ambassador of that blow-hard state. \"How do you guys live like this? I know Salina is all the way across the state from you, but I kind of noticed this problem the whole way.\" I stopped just short of commanding her to make that wind cease, or build a windbreak everywhere I thought I might want to stop if I made a return trip across her gusty state. And do you know Bean's response?\"The wind will blow the hair right off your head.\"Yes, she was quite poetic, my flatland-state friend. I do not use her phrase any more. Oh, I used to.

The day I picked up my mom and took her to get her hands on the Big Daddy she had been craving all week. Okay. I let her ride along while I stopped by my bank and credit union.

I'm sure it was not an issue of my repartee being less than clever. Mom was just pursuing that Big Daddy like a heat-seeking missile after a feverish fellow in an equatorial country with a bad sunburn who had just slathered on some BenGay after winning a ghost pepper eating contest.My financial business completed, Mom began informing me of her order. \"I want two sandwiches. A Big Daddy and the chicken one.\"\"So you don't want a combo? I know how you liked those fries. You don't want fries and a Diet Coke?\"\"Oh, I want a Diet Coke.\"\"Mom. If you get the combo, it's like the same price as a sandwich and soda, but you get the fries, too.\"\"But the fries always fill me up. Then I won't want the Big Daddy.\"\"You don't have to eat them today. You always warm them up in your toaster oven.\"\"Okay. Get me the combo. Wait. Just get me the chicken Big Daddy combo. I really want to try that chicken. It looks so good on the commercial. And then if you get the Big Daddy, I can see what's on the burger.\"\"Uh. If I get the Big Daddy, I don't plan on eating it in the car. It's not getting unwrapped until I get it home.\"\"Well, that's all right. You can tell me what's on it.\"\"Are you sure? Because what if you get snowed in? Then you'll have a spare Big Daddy. You can get a combo, and then another sandwich to save. Who knows when we'll be back over here. It might not be until the end of next month.\"\"All right. I'll get a combo and a Big Daddy.\"By this time we were inching toward the Rally's drive thru.\"I don't see the Big Daddy on the menu, Mom.\"\"Well, it's on the commercials.\"\"Do you have a Big Daddy combo?\"\"No. We don't have the Big Daddy any more.\" Mom's face fell. I might have heard a whimper.\"Oh. Well. This will take just a minute. Mom, what do you want?\"\"Well...I don't know. Just get me fries. And a Diet Coke.\"\"Mom. They have a Giant Chicken Sandwich. Do you want that?\" Mom was not having it. She was as petulant as a child. Or Val. This apple didn't fall far. \"Or they have just a chicken sandwich.\"\"I wanted the Big Daddy chicken. Just get me a hamburger.\"\"Mom. They don't have just a hamburger. You have to pick one of these on the menu.\"\"Oh...I don't know. Just...just...what about the number nine? Oh. It's chicken nuggets. You say they have a chicken sandwich? Get me that.\"I ordered Mom a giant chicken sandwich combo, and the number one burger combo for me. We pulled around and waited. And waited. I was starting to think the name \"Rally's\" was kind of ironic. But since I don't really understand what ironic means, I stopped short of that thought. The girl gave us our Diet Cokes. Then we waited some more.\"I have never waited this long at a Rally's. I guess we took so long to order that they grew old and decrepit. They must be waiting on that chicken to hatch. Hey! We've been here so long...maybe the Big Daddy is back for a new limited time offer!\"\"Oh, don't get me tickled!\"\"I'm sorry they didn't have your Big Daddy, Mom.

I went to the cafeteria to ask if anyone had heard any news on this topic. Nope. I was the town crier. I rushed back to mind my charges. We are working on projects, preparing them for the Monday deadline. After drawing numbers for presentation order, and getting them started, I checked to see if any news stations had picked up the story. Yes.

Not funny ha, ha. Funny peculiar. I was not laughing. It was not even one of those times when you don't know whether to laugh or cry. I was certainly not yucking it up, nor was I weeping. It brought a sigh to my lungs. A heavy sigh, the kind that might gush out of Paul Bunyan's chest and lay down 150 square miles of forest like the supersonic rush of gases that shot out of the north side of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980. I'm sure you can guess the precipitating factor in my sigh, just as you can guess the etiology of the Mount St. Helens gust.After telling me we needed a whole new oven, then pricing them, Hick changed his tune faster than a triathlete changing shoes between cycling and running. He investigated that element again with the help of The Pony. An act which was evident when I went to warm up supper one evening. The preheated one-element oven was in disarray. Two racks, people. Two racks. Yet Hick had put them back all asunder. One has a little prop-up thingy on the bottom, and the other is a flat rack. He had them reversed, and on the wrong ledges. Of course I couldn't move them while they were hot. What do you think I am, some kind of champion at those puzzles where you slide segments all willy-nilly back and forth, until you get them into the right position? I am a champion of many things, but spatial reasoning is not one of them. It took me a good five minutes to set things right after cooling.Last weekend, Hick browbeat me into a rendezvous with my BFF Google, for the purpose of procuring a new oven element. Never mind that it had been out of commission since November. That part had to be ordered RIGHT THAT MOMENT. When I refused to hand over all my financial information to that thuggy website through GoDaddy, Hick hopped in the one vehicle he has with four good tires and sped 20 miles to Lowe's. His BFF. That's when he gave me a new website, vouched for by Lowe's, so I ordered. That part was here by Tuesday.\u00a0 Hick could not help himself. When a man discovers a new element on his front porch, nothing will keep him from handling, unwrapping, stroking, admiring and inserting that element into whatever slot allows it access. Hick did not wait until the weekend to fiddle about with my new bottom element. Thursday evening, he hollered down into my dark basement lair, \"Your oven is fixed!\"Surely you don't think I ran upstairs to try it out. M-O-O-N. That spells, \"I was in no hurry to hoist myself back onto the merry-go-round of warming up things in the oven and then washing the dishes by hand.\" The Pony was gone Friday night, so Hick brought home Chinese. Saturday was bowling league at noon, and I whipped up some grilled pepper jack sandwiches on nutty oat bread for supper. So today at noon, I went to fire up my new old oven for the first time. I set it on 450 to preheat for some frozen potato skins that Hick wanted for watching some kind of NASCAR event. Heh, heh. You didn't really think I was cooking, did you?Let me say this about that. The new bottom element is definitely working. I knew that, because I smelled a charred Cheerio. The same one that fell out of my very first batch of World Famous Chex Mix back in November. The one that a normal person might have removed when he had his head inside my oven two times while inspecting the element, a third time while measuring my element, a fourth time while taking out the old element, and a fifth time while putting in the new element.Oh, and when I opened up the door to slide in the pan of potato skins for warming, I saw that once again, Hick had put the racks in wrong. I could not pry out those 450-degree metal branding irons and set them on the kitchen floor while finagling one or the other into place. Now I cannot even imagine their previous configuration. I'm going to have to get out the roasting pan and imagine it full of Chex and then get out my two 9x11s and put them on the lower rack, and see how they slide in and out every 15 minutes for two hours. Okay, I can probably figure it out after one slide-out. I'm kind of a genius like that.So...I asked Hick why he didn't take out that darned Cheerio, and he said, \"I was going to, but then I forgot.\"Five times."}, {"title": "Val's Subconscious Helps Build Strong Stories One Way", "date": "Saturday, February 22, 2014", "text": "The human body has 206 bones.This includes the tiny inner-ear bones children of my generation had to memorize in elementary school.

And the patella, which sometimes gets all out of joint and ends up laying alongside the knee in slack-ligamented people, a sight which makes me slightly nauseous.It does not include the funny bone, which is not a bone at all, but the ulnar nerve, which runs along the medial epicondyle of the humerus, and is most often pinched between the metal arms of two old-fashioned webbed lawn chairs when you're sitting too close to somebody and playing the Lucy/Ethel theater-seat armrest supremacy game.

Where are you?\"\"In the kitchen, making my plate.\"\"I forgot my eggroll. Could you drop it down?\" Let the record show that only five minutes earlier, I had offered to fetch a soda from the basement mini fridge and set it on the highest step I could reach, all to save Hick a trek to the basement. Not being one to listen before acting, Hick descended to my depths anyway, while telling me about our newest calamity, just on the heels of the flat tire on his Pacifica Thursday morning...the missing shingles from our roof last night.\"I'll get it.\"I stood at the bottom of the basement steps, hands outstretched, waiting for Hick to appear at the wooden railing above and drop my eggroll. There he was. He clomped into view in that special gait of his, like a toddler leaning forward, unable to stop, while clomping along as if he has no feet on the bottom of his ankles. What's that? Hick held an item in each hand. Both white. Did he bring both eggrolls?\"Are you ready?\"\"Wait! Which hand--\"Before I could get out the rest of my question, an eggroll shot past my cupped palms like a slider hurled by Bob Gibson in his heyday.

I stood there in disbelief like Willie Horton in Game 1 of the 1968 World Series.\"What the not-heaven...I didn't even know which hand you had the eggroll in! You threw it before you finished asking if I was ready! I didn't see it coming!\" Then I saw that Hick was clutching a paper towel in his left hand. Wadded in the same size and shape of the waxed paper bag that held my broken eggroll.\"You always complain.\" He stomp-clomped back to the kitchen.

Discovering a new element was the farthest thing from Mr. Thevictorian's mind when he awakened that fateful morning. All he expected was to start his day with a sausage egg biscuit and banana, commute to work, apply his nose to the grindstone, commute home, have some quality time with his goats and chickens, enjoy an evening repast of Auction Meat prepared less-than-appetizingly by his harpy fishwife, and tumble into bed, one day closer to his demise.Quality goat-time spent, Mr. Thevictorian entered by the back door. \"I was just coming from the goat pen, and I saw a box on our front porch. I guess I'll go see what it is.\" He clomped past his insignificant other, clods of mud falling from sole to floor. He returned with a large flat box. Mr. Thevictorian knew better than to shove it in Mrs. Thevictorian's face and expect her to take it off his hands. They'd had a discussion of that matter only the day before. (check out the link to the Police Report)\"Your element is here!\"\"Well, put it somewhere! You can't put it in tonight. I'm cookin' right now, and it's too hot to touch. Wait until the weekend.\"Neighbors heard the discussion and called the local news. Mr. Thevictorian was on the 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. broadcasts. He is currently waiting for a delicious meal to be warmed in the old oven by his ancient wife and her new element.********************************************************************* HOMETOWN SEPTUAGENARIAN ESPOUSES KEY TO LONGEVITYLongtime Backroads resident Tillie Tendollardaughermom will be joining the talk show circuit this spring to promote a new health fad.

In order to prepare, he has been simulating situations he might encounter there. Sunday evening, his mother called to him concerning supper: \"Pony! Are you eating baked rotini with us?\"The Pony galloped to the kitchen and stamped his hooves with anticipation. He headed off to his feeding area with a helping that would make Takeru Kobayashi feel bloated. As he pranced away from the stove, The Pony was heard to exclaim, \"I might as well start getting used to eating food I don't like.\"His mother, chief oven-warmer and microwave-heater, could not be reached for comment."}, {"title": "If It Weren't For Bad Ideas He'd Have No Ideas At All", "date": "Wednesday, February 19, 2014", "text": "Oh, dear. Hick has a new project in development. Of course I am quite positive this Hick-rigged device will result in my incineration. But let's not put the cart before the horse...We have a beagle named Tank who is getting on in years. He's 49 by the canine calendar. No longer a svelte rabbit-runner, the breakneck flying leaps off the porch have taken their toll on his joints. He whimpers every time he gets up to walk, and when the other dogs bump him or lash him with their waggers. Hick thinks Tank has arthritis, and doesn't like to hear him in pain. Here's a picture of Tank when he was but a pup. A pup making deals with the devil:Let's remember we're talking about Hick, here. Does Hick want to take Tank to the vet to get some doggy arthritis medicine? We know it exists, because Hick's old-man friend used to take the pills prescribed for his dog. But no, Hick is not interested in getting painkillers for Tank. He has said several times this winter, \"Well, I hate to do it, but I think I'm going to have to take Tank and have him put down.\"(!)\"What? He's a dog. Dogs hurt. They get a thorn in the foot, they limp. They get in fights, they have cuts to heal. They tangle with a porcupine, they have needle ouchies. You don't put a dog down just because you think he's in pain. He gets around. He lays in the sun. He follows your Gator down to the cabin. You think Tank would rather be DEAD than ache when he moves?\"\"Well, I guess you have a point. But I could never shoot him. I'd have to have Buddy up the road do it for me.\"\"You're not going to shoot Tank.\"\"No. I'd pay to have him put down.\"\"He's not that bad! Maybe he's just a whiner. He still eats. He gets off the porch. He runs around with the other dogs. Just slower.\"Now that we've had a warm snap, Tank has stopped his whining. In fact, this morning at 2:30 a.m., he felt fine enough to stand right under our bedroom window and bay at all manner of imagined intruders and woodland fauna. He's acting like his old self again. Guess that \"putting down\" business was a bit premature.Tonight Hick came in from looking for The Egg (which is quite elusive, it seems, having had no hen fruit for a month, then 20 discovered in a secret stash Monday, and now nothing again) and sat down to reveal his new project while I washed dishes.\"We have a heater that I took out of that old water bed. I think I'm going to sandwich it between two pieces of OSB board, and make a heating pad to put in Tank's dog house.\"\"Uh. No. No way am I going to have one of your contraptions on the other side of my bedroom wall, on the wooden porch of our wooden house, for you to incinerate me as I sleep. I won't even leave a lamp on all night. Why would I want a waterbed heater between two boards ready to combust the minute my eyes are closed?\" That's not just electricity-ignorant Val talkin'. Genius called tonight, and I told him the plan, and he said, \"That's a TERRIBLE idea!\" We're sending him to college to be an electrical engineer, you know.Right now that proposed water-bed-heater-wooden-pad plan has been tabled. Hick thought for a slim moment that he would just put a regular heating pad in Tank's dog house. \"Nah. He would probably eat it.\"One thing is certain.

Val could not hang out her shingle as a culinary artist even if she possessed the requisite skills. Like a polo champion mounted on a horse-donkey, a NASCAR driver behind the wheel of a Rascal, a diver poised over a teacup...Val is beset with adversity. Were it not for the lack of a lower heating element, Val's proverbial goose would be cooked.Perhaps I've let it slip that my oven has not been firing on all cylinders since at least November. I noticed it then, because when I made my first batch of world-famous Chex Mix, a Cheerio fell out of the pan. Normally, I would snag that sucker with a wooden spoon and whisk it out of char's way. But I was preoccupied that day, and left it until the two-hour Chex-tending cycle was done, fully expecting to see a tiny charcoal donut awaiting disposal. I'm still waiting.That Cheerio is as well-preserved as a five-year-old bag of McDonald's french fries. As pristine as the day it poured out of the box. I left it there, you see, as a test. To see if it would burn each time I used my oven. It did not. I complained to brought it to the attention of Hick. \"There's an element in this oven that won't light on one side.\" Perhaps I am a bit of a Grinch. \"The bottom side does not seem to be working. Go ahead. Touch it. Even though I'm cooking at 425, that element is not on.\" Huh. Neither Hick nor Genius would lay a finger on it. You'd think they were professional science teachers, all knowledgeable about conduction and convection and radiation.My problem has remained. I can't crisp a pizza, can't get my biscuits to brown on the bottom. Everything must cook on the top rack, where the surface blackens, the middle barely surpasses lukewarm, and the lower portion sometimes remains frozen. C'mon. You didn't think I really cooked, did you? To solve this issue, I have taken to setting my over 25 to 50 degrees higher than recommended. Mmm...makes you want to drop in for dinner, huh?Last weekend, Hick told me he checked my lower element with a gadget. According to The Pony, it was a multi-meter that measures ohms. He didn't help Hick then. All we have is Hick's word. Hick said that my whole oven was bad, because his meter said that the element was working. Which meant something more serious was amiss. That's Hick's story, and he's stickin' to it. I knew my whole oven wasn't bad. After all, it has one perfectly good upper element that fires up red and burns the tops of most edibles that need warming. And all four burners still work. So I was not necessarily on board with Hick's last-ditch solution of buying a new range. Hick even went so far as to drop by the furniture store and Lowe's to check them out.Yesterday Hick told me all I needed was a bottom bake element. Uh huh. Seems he had The Pony help him check the oven again. And lo and behold, the element was NOT working. According to The Pony, Hick said Genius must have used that multi-meter, and set it on amps instead of volts, which Hick did not notice. My condolences to his employer, who pays him twice my salary to do this sort of thing all the live-long day. Hick's story was that he couldn't really get into the oven to check it right, so he needed The Pony's help. I reminded him that he used THAT story to explain why he hadn't yet found the leak sprung by the big triangle tub in the master bathroom. Now he says the tub issue is on hold because he can't SEE what he's trying to inspect inside his built-in tub cabinet with removable doors. He really needs to keep a chart of what stories he gives me for specific appliance repair status.Anyhoo...Hick gave me a website and part number to order an element that looks nothing like my old one. That website was a ne'er-do-well in a back alley with pantyhose over his face waiting to club me on the noggin with a lead pipe, according to Firefox. So I refused to feed it my credit information. Hick went to Lowe's and asked them to order the part shipped to the store, since they are a Whirlpool dealer. They declined, but gave him a website for me to use which was secure.We'll see if this plan works.

But she is as tenacious as a terrier after a rat. In fact, Val likes nothing better than to pursue vermin of the two-legged, four-tired, mailbox variety.This morning I braved the icy gravel to head to town and deliver my mom's valentine, which work and the weather prevented me from doing yesterday. Lookie here:\u00a0 That's not water. That's ice. And you'll have to imagine me coming the other way, because I took these on the way home. It was just too dangerous to try snapping phone pics while careening out-of-control down an icy hill.So...I got down to the county road, which was in considerably better shape, being blacktop, and I saw a curious sight. It was a car at our mailbox row, on the wrong side of the road, the driver rummaging around in a furtive manner. Being Val, I immediately limbered up right there in the driver's seat of T-Hoe, and began jumping to conclusions. My razor-sharp intellect dashed willy-nilly through my brain library, pulling out long narrow card catalog drawers, refining my suppositions as to why this car seemed out of place.The car did not come out of our gravel road. It could not have gotten into that position at the mailbox row without considerable adjustment. There were no tracks in the road to suggest such a maneuver.I have never seen this car up in our enclave.The car was not dirty. No mud spatter. No road-salt spray.The driver reached out the driver's window, then toward the passenger seat. I could not see well. The windows were slightly tinted. It looked like the driver was putting the mail inside something. Perhaps wrapping it in a jacket. Driver did this at least three times. And twice Driver appeared to lean over and look at me out the passenger window. I was just sitting there with my T-Hoe running, waiting for that car to pull away, to either go on up the blacktop road, or back up and turn and come up in my frozen gravel wonderland. I could have squeezed out onto the county road, but it was easier without that car in that position. I had my 4WD-high on, and it's hard to make a sharp turn.I tried to pacify my vivid imagination. This was not the mailman. The mailman, even the substitute drivers, come from the other direction. That's how the route runs. Perhaps it was the free paper delivery person. Driver might have been folding a free paper and stuffing it in a plastic sleeve before jamming it into the wooden compartments of our mailbox row. Yeah. Surely that was the explanation. Darn it. Now I was going to get behind that frequent-stopper for two miles.Just then, the car took off. I pulled out in a wide right turn and headed the same direction, towards town. Well, didn't that just beat all! The car did not pull over at the next mailbox. Nor the next. In fact, the car took off at a speedy clip. I could not even see the license plate, which was white with dark numbers, because it was in one of those tinted cover things.The situation was getting curiouser and curiouser. It was like that car was trying to outrun me. I don't think so. I drive this road every day. I am aware of the nuances of the hills and gullies, curves and drop-offs. Detective Val tailed that car out to the lettered county road. Wow! That vehicle was moving. I put pedal to the metal. Perhaps I could discern that little white decal on the back window. Driver did not make it easy. I swear I was pushing 70 as we flew past the prison.Aha! Driver chose my regular route past the bowling alley. At ten mph over the speed limit. I followed through the first roundabout. On the second, Driver made a break for the highway, heading south. And I got a glimpse. Driver was a woman with frosted, shoulder-length hair, wearing a neon green jacket. Good to know.Something is fishy in Backroads. If I read in the paper that more mailbox thefts have occurred, I will have a description of the vehicle. It's not my mail I'm worried about this morning. It was way too early for today's mail, and I already picked up yesterday's.I'll be darned if I allow a crime to go unreported on my watch."}, {"title": "Slip Slidin' the Day", "date": "Friday, February 14, 2014", "text": "The upper atmosphere tried to give me my 19th snow day this morning. The effort was lackluster. After driving through no-woman's-land at temps in the upper 20s, The Pony and I arrived at school to find that a quick-moving heat wave had shot us into the low 40s by my 10:53 lunch time.Oh, the skies opened and rain poured, but even though the radar shaded our location in pink, our precipitation remained liquid. Funny thing about water flowing across the land that has been in single digits every night for a week. It tends to get colder and colder until it, too, freezes. By 1:30, temperatures dipped into the 30s. A couple of local schools waved the white flag of cowardice, and declared early dismissal.Our school simply announced that a bus would not run on a specific gravel road. What's that? We, too, were puzzled. High water, perhaps? Kids had to call parents to come fetch them at regular dismissal time. A game was scheduled nearby tonight, but the big speaker in the ceiling announced between classes that cheerleaders would not be attending. \"Huh,\" I told the librarian. \"Are cheerleader lives more valuable than player lives?\"The precipitation had ended by 2:00. It was that darned black ice warning in a neighboring county that had me concerned. After school, I told The Pony, \"We're leaving in 15 minutes. Don't run off ahead of me. I might need to hold onto your shoulder to go down that blacktop slope to the car. There's a black ice warning.\"\"Oh. There was black ice this morning. I saw it when I went in. Good thing you didn't step on any of it.\"\"You might have told me.\"\"I thought you'd see it for yourself.\" That's my boy. The one who doesn't really have any interest in helping people. In fact, he trotted ahead to the car. \"I saw the black ice over there, under where that white car is parked now. Nothing here.\" He jumped into T-Hoe and slammed the door. The door with raindrops now frozen to the window.The road looked mostly clear. In some spots it looked wet. Yesterday the county laid down those salty lines on the county roads. Some were still slightly visible, despite the morning deluge. We were fine until we got to the very last section by our mailbox.\"That looks like solid ice. Be careful when you get out.\" The Pony scrambled out to grab the mail. He pranced gingerly back to T-Hoe.\"You would be right. That's solid ice!\"The gravel road was also a solid sheet. Who would think that gravel would be slicker than blacktop? Not me. I've never seen it like this. I guess all that moisture couldn't sink in, and what had melted in from the snow yesterday rose to the top as it re-froze. I fishtailed around a flat curve, even with my 4WD-high scrabbling to keep me rooted to the non-pavement. At the garage, I had to inch forward, the slippage on the concrete slab beside it was so pronounced.Once safely inside, I called Mom. She had been thinking of going to town, what with her new-found freedom of a car that can make it from driveway to road. I had cautioned her this morning to watch the weather. That it looked like we were getting rain, but that the temperatures were going to drop once the storm moved on.\"Hi, Mom. Did you get out today?\"\"Yes. I ran over to Aldi's. I was planning to go in Walmart, too, but it was so cold when I got to Aldi's that I just came back home.\"\"When did you go?\"\"Oh, around 1:30.\"\"WHAT? That was the worst part of the day! Black ice! Didn't you know the school in that town let out at 2:00 because of black ice? I swear. I bet you didn't even have your 4WD on.\"\"No, I didn't have it on. The roads weren't slick. And I had watched the weather, and they said the precipitation moved out. It was warm when I left here. I didn't even need my coat, but I threw it in the car anyway because I always do, just in case. Now that you mention it, when I came back and stopped at my mailbox, it was frozen shut.\"\"You know, Mom, you are that lady who would go out for a little drive during the eye of a hurricane.\"\"Oh, it was fine. The roads weren't even wet.\"\"Yeah, I'm sure a great big school district like that lets out an hour early on a whim. I'm glad you made it back okay.\"\"It's still light. I was thinking about running back to town to Walmart.\"\"NO! It's 25 degrees. Stay home.\"How ya gonna keep her, there in the house, after she's left the driveway?

I can't exactly call it Sh*t My Mom Does, because that's kind of been done in a slightly different way. However, my mom would NEVER approve of the word sh*t. No sirree, Bob! We were not even allowed to say f*rt in our house. Or p**p. Or cr*p. We were verbally constipated. The closest Mom ever came to putting that topic into words was when somebody, (and I'm sure it was none of our family, because we knew better, knew the sh*tstorm that would result if we let one r*p), allowed an iota of flatulence to escape in the vicinity of Mom's snout. Mom would get that put-upon expression on her face, that sad, sad look, like the little bioluminescent bluebird in Journey to the Center of the Earth, the one with Brendan Fraser and Josh Hutcherson, when Josh tried to hop across those floating magnetic rocks over a chasm a billion feet deep, and knocked the last one in the line away from the edge. \"Does somebody need to go to the bathroom?\" That's all it took.

I had promised her that I would come by after school to take her to the bank if she couldn't get out. Mom didn't want me to go out of my way, but I insisted. I told her I would call her after school to see if she got her Blazer out. I figured if all went well, she would get out and drive herself to the bank and run around town and kick up her heels in her holey-kneed gray sweatpants. She, herself, mentioned yesterday that she thought she was going stir crazy. When I talked to her at 10:00 last night, she agreed that salt just might work on thawing that pile of compacted snow at the edge of the road. In fact, she had tried to crush some of those one-inch cubes left over from her water softener, but could not. She didn't want to toss them out whole, because all they do is melt down in a hole to the ground.\"Mom. What's that gonna hurt? It will make holes to break up the big chunk, and then lay on the gravel until it dissolves.\"\"I guess you're right. I have a little bucket down in the basement that I can put some in when I get my plant dirt. I know it will melt tomorrow. When the sun hits that dirt, it won't take long.\"I woke up with a killer headache this morning. When I called Mom, she still had her dirt plan. She said, \"I would ask if there's anything I can do for you, but, well, I'm probably not going anywhere until this afternoon.\" All day I wondered how Mom was getting along.I called as soon as I got back inside from my parking lot duty. \"Did you get your car out, Mom?\"\"Well, I put it off until 2:00. I thought, 'Oh, I can't go through this again. It's so disappointing.' The sun really did a lot of melting. I went out several times, and took a shovel, and chopped around where that salt made holes. There was only a little strip left, between my gravel and the blacktop. And this time, I didn't turn my wheels. I backed straight out. I didn't have any problem at all. In fact, I did it without even having my 4WD on.\"\"Mom! I don't know what you're saving that 4WD for! If there was ever a time to use it, it's now.\"\"But I didn't need it. How's your headache? I've been worried about you all day.\"\"It's gone now. I took an ibuprofen around 9:30, but it didn't work until 11:45. That headache will probably come back later tonight, when the ibuprofen wears off.\"\"Oh, honey, I hope not. So, are you getting ready to come out?\"\"NO! I'm going home. I've had such a day!\"\"Oh. I was really looking forward to you coming by.\"\"Yeah, right! I'm sure you were!\"\"You go on home and put your feet up. Maybe take a nap and get some rest while The Pony and Hick are gone to the academic meet. I'll get my stuff together and take my checks to the bank. You take care of yourself.\"\"Wait. You didn't go to the bank when you got your car out?\"\"No. I went back down the driveway and put it in the garage. I knew you were coming by. I was even going to buy you supper while we were out, or give you some money to pick something up. I'm so glad you're feeling better. You don't need to come all the way out here. I can go to the bank.\"\"What time does you bank close, Mom? Five? I can make it.\"\"Oh, don't cry. You go on home. You are so good to me. I don't have to cash those checks today.\"\"I've got to put these grades in. It will take about ten minutes. Then I'll be right there.\"\"You can pull on down in the driveway.\"\u00a0 What kind of terrible daughter am I? It was just a misunderstanding. Two. I was sure Mom would drive herself to the bank when she got her car out. All the town roads have been clear for a week. And when she said she was looking forward to me coming by, I thought she was joking. I talk to her twice a day. So I thought she was pulling my leg, joshin' me, polishing her wit to a fine edge on the grindstone of sarcasm. I had no idea she had been waiting all day for me to come pick her up. I was beside myself. How selfish of me. I rushed through today's scores and tossed the in-school suspension work aside for grading tomorrow.

Today marks nine days, with only the briefest of escapes when I took her for a drive to the Dollar Tree on Sunday morning. I will commend Mom for trying. She asked me to come park on the road and watch her try to back her Blazer out of the garage and up the driveway. I did what any good seven-dollar daughter would do, and headed by McDonald's to pick up a Diet Coke and some grilled onion cheddar burgers for the shut-in.Yes, Mom gave it the old night-college try. She backed out, partway up the drive, then started to slip. That was her clue to stop. Then try to back some more. Which is not really proper 4WD backing etiquette. It set her to spinning more. She couldn't even get her tires over into the path dug by her neighbor. Mom gave it about five attempts, then called it a day. I could see she was disappointed. That's when I told her to forget it and lock up her house and come for a ride. I said I would try to get the car out, but Mom declined.Mom has been hanging onto the promises of the TV meteorologists every night. Each morning she rises with hope springing eternal, positive her driveway is going to melt. Yesterday, my sister the ex-mayor's wife and her daughter dropped by with the baby. Let the record show that they parked in the driveway. Did they offer to get her Blazer out of the driveway so she could run to town? No. Did they offer to take her to the bank to cash her little checks that are burning a hole in her business-size yellow safe? No. All they brought was a BABY! A month-old baby is no help with getting a car out of a snowy driveway. What they were thinking is beyoooooond me.I told Mom I would come by after school today and take her to the bank. \"Oh, no. I don't really have to get out. Besides, the temperature is going to be almost thirty. I'm sure I will be able to get out today.\"On my way home, I called. \"Did you get out of your driveway, Mom?\"\"No. I got all the way to the top, but my tire was stuck on that deep part where the road was plowed. I even dug a hole in the gravel with my other tire, the one in the cleared path. I threw rocks all over the place. But I couldn't get out. Tomorrow it's supposed to be in the thirties. I'm going to take some soil out of my plants and put it on that patch of snow. It's dark. That will make it melt, like when I put ashes on the other part of the driveway.\"\"Mom. You might make mud. And your ashes probably got smushed down in when Sis parked there in the driveway. I'll come by after school tomorrow. The Pony has an academic meet, so I'll be by myself.\"\"You do too much for me. Don't worry. I don't HAVE to get out. I'm sure I'll be able to with my dirt.\"\"Have you tried salt? That's what most people use to melt their ice.\"\"Salt? I never thought of that!\"Seriously.

I'm late! For a very mediocre or possibly even sub-par blog post. But I have a good excuse.I WAS HELD HOSTAGE BY CEILINGREDS!Oh, my insurance woes never cease. At least I've been getting my medication on a timely basis. However...one of the prescriptions is only available at CeilingReds, and it costs me three bills. Not Washingtons. Not Lincolns. Not Hamiltons. We're talking Jacksons! It's been that way for several months. Every time, the CeilingReds staff asks if I'm using the proper insurance card. Yes. Yes I am. One time they tried to run my secondary insurance card, but ended up telling me that their system won't let them bill a secondary insurance. So imagine my surprise today when the Window Gal asked for my secondary card.I was in a hurry, you see, having just come from a nice visit with my best old ex-teaching buddy Mabel on the school parking lot. The plan was to pick up that prescription, then head over to the dead-mouse-smelling post office before it closed at 4:30 to pick up a package. I left plenty of time for my two errands. Or so I thought.Fortune smiled upon me in the guise of an empty CeilingReds drive-thru lane. I had my three bills at the ready. I announced my name. Spelled it, even. Kept one eye on the clock. Window Gal asked if I was using the correct insurance card. I verified my primary. She frowned at her computer. I could see her through the bulletproof glass. Then she wanted my secondary card. I put it through the metal drawer. Time was ticking. A car pulled in behind me. Time marched on. A truck lined up behind the car. Time began to limp. Ten minutes had passed. I really needed to get out of there.\"I'll just pay for it. I've got to be somewhere else. I've been here quite a while. Just give me back my insurance card.\" Window Gal did not react. She squinted at her screen. She called over another staffer. I was getting agitated. I pecked on the bulletproof glass. I pushed the call button. Window Gal picked up the phone receiver. \"I'll just pay. I don't have time for this today. I need to get to Backroads before 4:30.\" Window Gal pushed out the metal drawer. I put my three bills inside. She sucked it back in.The truck guy squealed his tires and backed up, then barreled around the drive-thru, slowing down to glare at me like a madman. \"I don't know what YOU'RE staring at!\" I hollered. \"It's not like I WANT to be here. I'm trying to leave!\" Huh. He kept glaring, then sped around the corner. The car behind me also went around. Too bad, so sad. I've been stuck at the drive-thru before. But now it was different. I wanted to drive off. BUT CEILINGREDS NOW HAD MY INSURANCE CARD AND MY THREE BILLS, while I had nothing. Not even a person to hear my demands.I pushed the call button again. \"I REALLY need to leave. Just send out my medicine and my insurance card. I'll deal with this another time.\" Five minutes later, I got my goods. Window Gal explained that their system in unable to bill a secondary insurance. JUST LIKE THEY SAID A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO! I wish they'd get their act together. And not cost me twenty minutes and a possible drive-thru-rage attack.The dead mouse was gasping its last breath when we arrived."}, {"title": "WARNING: Immature Content", "date": "Monday, February 10, 2014", "text": "You're not gonna believe this one.

Whether it's feces transplants, or gender-and-species confused tuxedo cats, or a single spider exploding into millions of itsy-bitsy spiders at five minutes to midnight in a dark basement lair...you are there.

And something needs to be kicked. Wait! Perhaps that title is not descriptive enough. Here's the rest of it: \"How a woman breast-fed an orphaned Labrador puppy when it was just one hour from death.\" Uh huh. Now you want to click on it, don't you?I cry shenanigans! How did that woman know the puppy was one hour from death? Is she psychic? Is she a veterinarian? Oh, no. She's not. But a real veterinarian advised against this practice of human women breastfeeding canine puppies. Go figure! Seems diseases could be passed. You don't say! And that Feeder had a 15-month-old child! Ain't that a kick in the head? \"Sorry, honey. You can eat later. The puppy is one hour from death. It's his turn now.\" Or maybe she let them both feed at the same time. What's that you say? That would be just plain weird? THE WHOLE FREAKIN' SITUATION IS WEIRD!Certain lines should not be crossed. Like the puppy lips on a human nipple line. Somewhere, between love and madness, lies obsession. Wait! That was a Calvin Klein commercial. But this woman is clearly obsessed. And quite mad, in my opinion. I'm not a puppy-hater. I rescued that puppy who turned into my best pet ever, my sweet, sweet Juno, when my mom tried to starve her so she would go away. But let me set the record straight. If it came down to the ONLY way I could save my future sweet, sweet Juno was by breastfeeding her...I would have gotten a shovel and started digging her the best grave ever. Call me a dog-killer if you must. But one thing nobody is ever going to call Val is a puppy-suckler.Seriously. Where do we draw the line? Maybe puppy-suckling is a gateway behavior. Before you know it, that gal could be arrested (in some states) for having intimate relations with an equine! I try to be open-minded, but canoodling between species should be prohibited. Even if Feeder wanted to save that puppy she knew was going to die in one hour, and the only antidote was her breast milk straight from the teat, DID SHE HAVE TO CONVENIENTLY PROVIDE A PICTURE OF THE ACT ON FACEBOOK? And keep breastfeeding him until the one-time runt with one hour to live eventually outgrew his litter mates to the extent he is now called TUBS?I think not.My proposed handbasket factory will reap the benefits."}, {"title": "Thevictorians Wobble, But They Still Fall Down", "date": "Sunday, February 9, 2014", "text": "Woe is Val. She took a spill yesterday. Oh, not outside on the slippery, icy landscape. Nope. Val is not a conventional stumbler. She lurches to her own drummer. She slammed myself to the floora firma inside her own residence.Yes, in her sad bid for attention, Val threw caution to the breather winds and her well-padded skeleton to the braided rug over press-down tile over concrete floor of her basement retreat. The timing was not conducive to attention-garnering. At 10:10 p.m., Genius had departed thirty minutes earlier, Hick had retired to his boudoir in anticipation of his 4:00 a.m. wake-up call for a business trip, and The Pony had stepped into the shower above a scant ten minutes previous.So there was Val, wondering how things had gone so horribly wrong, helpless upon the floor like a turtle on its back. \"AAAAAGGHHHH\" did not elicit a reaction. So sad. Good thing Val's expiration date was not up.I had just turned on my lamp, the one which previously needed pliers for operation, and was backing up to turn to my blue basement recliner. Unfortunately, the 12' x 8' braided rug which my grandma had given me way back before Genius was born had other ideas. That rug has gaps that open their toothless maws every now and then. Gaps between the rings of braids. One such gap chomped onto the heel of my red Croc. I thought I could save myself. I really did. In fact, I felt my momentum almost stop. I put my left hand down on a giant box of candy that Genius had gotten at Walmart on Thanksgiving night and given to The Pony for Christmas. It's down to eight pieces left. My hand crushed through the top, down into the bottom section, all the way to the table. But my Croc heel was still held captive by the gap. My center of gravity pulled me down, down, down, left arm scrabbling at that coffee table. Nope. Gravity won this one.I suppose I'm lucky I didn't crack my skull. Thanks for the cushy braided attempted-murderer, Grandma. I have a lovely bruise on the inside of my elbow, a sore right abdomen from attempting to right myself in the crunch to end all crunches, and a pain between my big toe and second toe that has something to do with that Croc ending up sideways on my foot.Yes.

And you know what that means to my mom. People need to STAY OUT OF HER DRIVEWAY!I don't know why Mom is like that. She says it's because the snow gets packed down and turns into ice. So she placidly sits inside her brick split-level home, waiting for the thaw. Oh, she ventures out to get the mail and her newspaper. But she doesn't walk up the driveway. Mom goes straight up through the yard. Can't have compacted footprints making that driveway all slippery.Another excuse Mom gives for the driveway ban is that she's afraid people might get stuck there. And by \"people\" she is referring to relatives, like me, Genius, Hick, and my sister the ex-mayor's wife. The ex-mayor himself is apparently immune, since during the last big freeze he waltzed his SUV right down in there without permission before crotchety ol' Mom could step out on her porch, cantankerously shake a broom at him, and holler, \"You ex-mayors stay out of my driveway!\" Thank goodness the Ex-M didn't get stuck. I don't think Mom fully grasps the concept of four-wheel drive. And you'd think she's never heard of a tow truck, either. It's like she fears somebody getting stranded and having to live with her until spring. Maybe she has Donner tendencies. She does, after all, refuse to leave the house until all snow is melted. It's a good thing she has people looking out for her.On Thursday, Mom looked through the front window (to see if the snow had melted yet, I presume) and saw that somebody had shoveled a path down her driveway. \"I don't know who would have done that. They went all the way down to the gravel on that one side, right up to the porch. They even cleared off the steps. But I don't go that way. I don't want to slip. I take my broom and walk through the snow. I did go across the yard and then up the driveway path, though. They even shoveled over to my mailbox.\"\"Huh. You have more odd happenings at your house! What if it's that guy who brought you two bags of hedgeapples after not talking to you for 11 years? I'm sure it was your neighbor. The one who brought you your mail last time. He might be expecting more Chex Mix.\"\"Oh, did I tell you? When I got out Tuesday morning, to mail my weekly card to Genius with the five dollars in it, I called Neighbor's Wife to tell her I was going to put last week's tabloids in her paper box. I had a little snack bag of Chex Mix left over, and I put that in there, too.\"\"NO! Not her paper box! What if the paper lady thinks it's for HER?\"\"Oh, on my way home, I made sure to look and see if Neighbor's Wife had got it yet, and she had. The paper lady doesn't come until after noon, except on the weekends.\"\"Well, that's good to know. I remember how you said Neighbor got that Chex Mix you left him one time, and he had eaten half of it before he got up his driveway.\"\"You know, I always ask Neighbor's Wife if I can run those tabloids up to her house. I'm on my way to town anyway, and I'm driving right by. But you know, she tells me to put them in her paper box. Then she comes right out to get them. Neighbor's Wife won't let me come up her driveway! She lets everyone else, but not me!\"\"Ha ha!

I still haven't asked. But something happened Wednesday night that gave me pause. Made me think that perhaps my sweet baboo was blameless of all assumptions. Innocent until proven guilty!I used my electronic leg-skin-baker while happily peck peck pecking at my keyboard until around 9:00 p.m. Then I turned it off, as I always do, and went to other parts of the basement for big-screen TV viewing. I called my mom around 10:00, watched a little TMZ so I know what's going on in the entertainment world, and fell asleep in my blue recliner. I awoke around 2:00 a.m., all bespectacled and wandering where the time had gone. I pried my old glasses from behind my ears, and went upstairs to go to bed.In the kitchen, I plugged in my cell phone to charge for the rest of the night. And the doubt of Hick's dastardly deed wafted through my mind like tendrils of fog in a Scooby Doo mystery. I smelled something. Not something rotting inside Frig. Not supper onions left on the counter. Something burny. Like electrical wire kind of burny.I checked the toaster that nobody uses until Genius comes home. Cold as a witch's teat. Stuck my nose up under the cabinets by the mini fluorescent lights. No odor. We have no other appliances on the counter. Not coffee drinkers in need of a maker are we. I sniffed Frig's nether regions. Nope. Fresh as a dusty daisy. WAIT! Maybe my under-desk heater had an electrical short. I know I turned it off. But what if something was all melty between the wall plug and the business end of The UnderBaker? I really did not want to walk back downstairs. But, like a devious table lamp, The UnderBaker is one of those gadgets that can't be trusted not to burst into flame if you leave it on all night.Funny. The burning rubber aroma did not seem to come from my left, the area toward the basement stairs. It came from the right. The area across the sink counter, the table nook. Nothing on that side to combust. Just a cuckoo clock that runs on weights that hang on chains. A wooden table and four chairs. A wooden stool. The metal kitchen door. Mini-blinds. Hick's coat hanging over the chair back. Hick's boots.HICK'S BOOTS! He's only had them since around the time of the Good Feet Store debacle. Let's not dwell on that. Hick's steel-toe tan suede work boots with their relatively new rubber soles sat square on the metal heating vent beside the kitchen door. Let the record show that the temperature Wednesday night was -11 in Backroads. So the furnace ran pretty much continuously, with short intermissions to draw breath. The heating vent had no chance to cool down. Kind of like a domestic China Syndrome, or a truck chopped into parts and buried at Kerr-McGee's Cimmaron River plutonium plant. Like Cher as Dolly Pelliker told Meryl Streep as Karen Silkwood that her friend Sudie Bond as Thelma Rice had been cooked...so were Hick's boot soles. Only Hick's boots were cooked from the outside by heat, and not from the inside by plutonium.Yeah. Hick is acquitted of under-desk heater tampering, and will face more severe charges of in-kitchen boot-melting."}, {"title": "Val Realizes an Underlying Reality of the Underground", "date": "Thursday, February 6, 2014", "text": "Well, this is awkward. Yesterday I left you in my grandpa's basement. Calm down. I'm coming back for you now. There's no reason to be scared, even if you didn't know where to reach the pull-strings for those light bulbs. Uh huh. The switch by each door only turned on the closest bulb. You'd think a guy who was an electrician might have remedied that situation, huh? But it was only a basement to him. Not a personal playground.I was never scared in that basement. No headless men appeared to me. I heard no footsteps or unexplained sounds. No, I was never scared. But I did have an eerie moment. It must have been a weekend. My grandpa had been in and out, and had left the light on over his workbench. I liked looking at the pegboard on the wall behind it, seeing the tools arranged on their hooks. Of course there were always works in progress on the bench itself. Greasy shop towels, chunks of motors, odd cans in varieties of shapes containing lubricants, dissolvers, cleaners, paint, and varnish, with brushes in various stages of cleanliness laying across their lids.On this afternoon I felt drawn to the workbench. It was like that light was a spotlight, pulling me towards one certain section. I crept closer, my bare feet cool on the concrete, coated with a thin layer of reddish-brown dust that could never be swept from the basement floor. I don't know why I felt the need to move with stealth. Nobody ever yelled at me for playing in the basement. Grandpa had let me stand next to him at the workbench many a time. I was the oldest grandchild on that side of the family. I could do no wrong.As I got closer, I saw a metal plate laying flat on the wooden workbench. It glowed like a penny in the reflected light. It was not too big, not too small. About the size of my baby-blue plastic rectangular pencil box with the corrugated opaque plastic cover that slid open and closed like a roll-top desk. I loved that pencil box.There was writing on that shiny metal plate. IT WAS MY NAME! Valerie Sue Thevictorian! And there were numbers under my name. Dates. IT WAS A HEADSTONE NAMEPLATE! But I wasn't dead! I was standing right there, in the cool dim safety of my grandpa's basement.Oh, yeah. I was named after my father's little sister, who had died in early childhood of an infection. I knew who I was named for, but I really didn't dwell on it. It was not a matter that was ever discussed around me. I backed away from the workbench and went outside.The basement had lost its charm for me that day.

You are allowed, however, to hate Val because she spent her 16th snow day of this school year lolling about her husband's La-Z-Boy watching HGTV's Income Property.Okay. I didn't spend the whole day watching basement renovations. I spent half the day in my own dark basement lair. We always planned on using our basement as an extension of our living area. A basement is a terrible thing to waste. It's a whole 'nother house! I'm not ready to convert it into four apartments to rent to college students, so I'll never be on Income Property. I'm glad my grandma and grandpa never rented their basement to college students. Some might think they let that space go to waste. But not my 7-11-year-old self!I grew up next door to Grandma and Grandpa, my dad's parents, in a mobile home on their spare lot. To borrow a partial quote from Frances \"Baby\" Houseman, \"...it didn't occur to me to mind.\" My sister the future mayor's wife and I had the run of the basement. It was never locked. We had access through the outside door, down a set of six concrete steps under the sunporch on the back of Grandpa's house.The house itself didn't interest me. You entered through the front door, and it was a straight shot through the living room, dining room, kitchen (where Grandpa kept his jar of pickled pigs' feet), and screened-in sun porch filled with a piano and old furniture piled with coats. Through an archway off the right of the dining room was the hallway to the master bedroom on the right, where Grandma kept her fat-jiggling belted vibrator machine, and the twin-bed room to the left, with a bookcase filled with Zane Grey and Hardy Boys books. Oh, and there was a bathroom with almond-smelling Jergens lotion, and peroxide and Mercurochrome. But the most fascinating part of that hardwood-floored hallway was the door to the basement, located between the twin-bed room and the bathroom.It's not like I had to sneak away to enter the basement. Nobody really ran after me or told me to stay out. Sometimes Grandma would flip on the light switch for me before I started down, but I was perfectly capable, and unafraid, even in the dark. After all, the basement had windows around the top edge that let in some light. In the summer, you could swing them open and hook them to the ceiling for ventilation. The staircase down was steep, with no handrail, made of creaky wood. I balanced myself by putting a hand on each wall until I ran out of wall. By that time I was about seven steps down, near the landing, where a black metal pipe ran along the right side to keep one from tumbling off onto Grandpa's workbench that ran along the side of the house all the way to the front. A cute set of four triangle-shaped steps led me down to the left, putting me into the concrete-floored basement proper.That area at the bottom of the steps was our unofficial playroom. Not so much a playroom as a stack of toys that were too numerous for our mobile home, and were piled willy-nilly according to season. My favorites were the child-sized air mattress with a clear plastic window for looking straight down into the water, and a blue and a green hard plastic fish suitable for sitting on in river or pool, in a butt-sized hollow between the whale-headed fish's wide shoulders and curving tail. Much of my Johnny West horse collection was there as well, along with Etch-A-Sketches, chalk boards, baseball bats and gloves, an Easy Bake Oven, Feely Meely, Creepy Crawlers, Fun Flowers, Kerplunk, Mousetrap, and a pile of other games. Nobody ever yelled at us to straighten them. It was our territory, taking up about a fourth of the basement.Across from the toy wonderland, on the other side, unofficially divided by the outside door's walkway through the basement, was Grandpa's territory. This is where he kept his push mower, his outboard motor, a couple of tires, and mechanical stuff in which I had no interest. Moving back along that side took us to Grandpa's stove. It was for cooking, but not for food. Grandpa cooked his work clothes there. Yep. In a big pot, he boiled his work clothes, dipping in every now and then with a wooden spoon to stir or lift them up. He wore some kind of striped coverall zippered outfit, but I don't remember much about it. Only that he worked as an electrician in the lead mines.The regular washer and dryer was next. Then the very best part of all: MY GRANDMA'S BOOK ROOM! Oh, it was grand. The room used to be a coal room. There was a little door up near the top, on the outside wall, where coal came in. Except the door was sealed off outside by the sidewalk, and this was now an unofficial library. Every wall was covered with books. Floor to ceiling. Shelves were just book width, painted a shiny battleship gray, built by my Grandpa. Oh, I spent hours in there. I could leave the gray plywood door open, or close it with a little slide-bar latch. The floor in the book room was a patterned red-and-black carpet, comfortable to sitting or laying or barefoot pacing. I had my run of the place. My sister was not the least bit interested. All that mattered to her was that I did not sit on her blue plastic fish from the toy pile.Basements today are such antiseptic, operating-room-lit, unimaginative places for kids to play."}, {"title": "Neither Rain, Nor Snow, Nor Dark of Night...", "date": "Tuesday, February 4, 2014", "text": "Have you heard? The mail has been running late. Maybe it's just around Backroads. People complain that the mail carriers are out at 9:00 p.m. with headlamps, delivering junk. They get their neighbor's mail. They find their own dumped in a snowdrift. Folks have been up in arms about their bills being late. To the tune of 30 days late, with city water bills. Somebody complained to a congresswoman, and the bills were \"found\" and delivered within several days. I had no dog in that fight. (That's just an expression. Val Thevictorian certainly does not condone canine altercations. Nor stuffing felines into sacks just to release them.) We have well water, so whether people pay or do not pay their water bill on time is of no nevermind to me.What does concern me, though, is my credit card bill. We only use one card. On purpose. And we pay it off every month. It normally comes around the 25th, and I send my check right back out in the mail. I'm not one to let things slide until the due date. Bill in, money out. No forgetting that way. Hick used to wait until the due date. \"Why should I let them earn interest on my money instead of me?\" Yeah. Like earning interest is even much of an option these days.Anyhoo...I looked and looked for my credit card bill every day. Some days we got NO mail. Some days we got junk mail. Still, the credit card bill did not arrive. I looked on my old statement. It's not really due until the 18th. But with the state of postal service in Backroads lately, I didn't want to cut the turnaround time short. I have been telling Hick for at least a week that our credit card bill is missing. \"Maybe it got put in somebody else's box. We get that one lady's Victoria's Secret catalog all the time. And that other guy's retirement check statement. I guess we're out of luck if somebody took it. They'll have our account number and address and know where we charge stuff. I've been calling that automated number to make sure no new charges are on it. I guess I'll just call tomorrow and tell them we didn't get the bill, and pay it over the phone with the debit card. At least it'll be done.\"This morning we didn't go to school again because of the snow. That means that I got to loll in the warm bed with no sharp toenails woodpeckering at my shins while Hick got up and went to work. I was up by 7:30 to remind The Pony to take the trash dumpster to the end of the driveway. I went into the kitchen and saw a note on the counter. This was not the usual note on a paper plate, but a note on the back of a wide junk-maily envelope. Still in Hick's handwriting, though.\"Val, I found this mail in the truck. I guess it's been in there since the last time I drove it and picked up the mail.\" Which would have been, oh, I don't know...during the last batch of continuous snow days.Under that note and a DISH Network advertisement and a Consumer Reports junk mail fake magazine was our credit card bill.

She's like her own mom, who couldn't wait to watch the Cardinals on TV, then turn them off if they got behind. Not a good loser, my grandma. Many a time she trounced us grandkids at croquet. Not merely beating us by playing a steady mature game to our scatterbrained, immature efforts. No. A bloodthirsty, give-no-quarter game of placing her orthopedic shoe on top of her black ball, next to our colorful striped orb, and whacking us across the blacktop road into the dense hardwood forest.

Don't like 'em, don't listen to 'em, don't need to see 'em in a major production. In fact, I may have, commented to Hick, please pardon my crass analogy, \"This halftime show appears to be a real sausagefest this year. I don't think a lot of guys want to see Bruno Mars and The Red Hot Chili Peppers. And aren't most of the viewers of the Super Bowl guys? I mean, sure the women might be watching with one eye while bringing out more snacks, but I imagine the demographic is predominantly male.\" Okay. So I didn't use those exact words. I was talking to Hick, remember? I just mentioned that guys wouldn't like it, and women would be busy during halftime.Hick got my drift. We're simpatico like that. \"Who IS that guy? I've never seen him before. And who's that fool with his shirt off? What they need is the Rockettes. They don't even need music. Just the Rockettes, kickin' their legs up.

I often find myself at school, reaching down to turn it on, when I don't have one at school.Friday night, I turned on my heater. It takes a few minutes to warm my workspace.

I was as disappointed as a caffeineophile tossing back an espresso and discovering it was only the meltwater left from a 44 oz. Diet Coke full of ice from the day before. Oh, dear. Surely my little Spacy had not gone the way of my oven. Surely he was not out of his element.I reached down to see if he was sitting on his cord. That makes him shut off, if he is jostled, or sitting unevenly. But he was humming. Purring along. Spitting out lukewarm air. Spacy has two dials. The only one I ever touch is his on-off. Depending on the ambient temperature of my dark basement lair, I might turn that dial a quarter turn, or all the way to half, straight up-and-down. When the surrounding temp is warm enough, Spacy shuts himself off. But now he was blowing weak atmospheric sauce.I searched for the other button. I've not messed with it in years. I found a happy medium, and left it. Huh. I didn't bother to turn on the light. A bright basement lair is only conducive to tax season. Aha! There it was. I turned that control to the right. And Spacy got all fired up. Huh. What was that all about?My tack-sharp conspiracy-sniffing mind says that Hick paid a visit to my lair while I was at work. That Hick took it upon himself to dial back my comfort. Whether to make me spend less time there, or make me spend less money on the electric bill and quit harping on the cash we waste heating his empty BARn. I don't presume to understand the motives of Hick. But all signs point to tamperage with my office cozy.I have not yet addressed the discovery. What Hick doesn't know never hurts him."}, {"title": "And Now, the Rest of Mom's Story", "date": "Saturday, February 1, 2014", "text": "My mom. The gift that keeps on giving. And I'm not talking about her five dollars here and ten dollars there. When we last convened, Mom told me a story of her friend Freda leaving a card in her newspaper box yesterday. A card that was mysteriously absent when Mom went up to the road to get her paper. Just to fill you in on a pertinent detail to which you were not privy previously, the card was a sympathy card in response to the passing and subsequent funeral of Mom's brother.I called Mom this evening, and offhandedly asked, \"So, did you get your card today?\" Because, you see, we thought the Newspaper Lady might have noticed that the card was not addressed to her, and would put in back in the box today.\"Oh, yes! You've got to hear this!\" Yes. I did. But first I silenced Mom while I watched the forecast. A ten-dollar daughter can get away with that, you know. Mom doesn't mind listening to me breathe for five minutes before resuming our conversation.\"What was that, Mom? The weather is over. You might not want to get out for church tomorrow morning. So you got your card? I bet that was a relief. I guess she saw that it was addressed to you.\"\"NO! I said I got a card. But it wasn't that card! It was a THANK YOU CARD! And it was addressed to Freda! Here. I'll read it to you: 'Dear Freda: Thank you so much for your kind and thoughtful card. Thank you for thinking of me. I appreciate your kindness. Not many like you out here. God bless. Newspaper Lady. P.S. You made my day.' Not only did Newspaper Lady take my card, she thought it was for her! And she sent back a thank you note!\"\"That is too funny. I can't believe the stuff you get into. Did you find out if the card was addressed on the envelope?\"\"Yes. I saw Newspaper Lady leave my paper this morning around 8:00. It comes early on the weekend. I went up and got it, and saw that card stuffed down in the plastic wrapper. I couldn't believe what I read. Then I had to wait to call Freda. She says she doesn't answer her phone until 9:00. So as soon as it was 9:00, I called and read her that card. She said that she will never leave anything in that box again! That my card had my name on the outside of the envelope. She said she had a mind to call Newspaper Lady and tell her that the card was MINE, and she had no business taking it. I wouldn't be surprised if Freda calls the newspaper office and tries to get Newspaper Lady fired.\"\"Didn't you read her the lovely thank you note? I can't believe someone would get a sympathy card, without even needing sympathy, and automatically assume it was written for her! But it's not like she was just a common thief, thinking, perhaps, that she'd found a birthday card that might have money in it. She didn't throw it away and pretend she never saw it. She took the time to write a thank you note!\"\"Well, I'm thinking about putting a card in the box tomorrow telling her, 'Freda doesn't live here. I don't know who Freda is, or what this card is all about.'\"\"Oh, no! Then Newspaper Lady will know she messed up. She will be embarrassed. What if she feels bad and takes an overdose of something?\"\"The card DID have my name on it. And she took it. I guess it's possible that she thinks I've forgotten her name is Newspaper Lady, and that I think it's my name.\"\"I don't know how you get yourself into these predicaments. Maybe it WASN'T a dog that unwrapped your foil cinnamon roll and took one bite and wrapped it back up. Maybe it was Newspaper Lady. She has opposable thumbs, you know. And your card.\"\"I'm going to make a copy of this thank you card and give it to Freda.\"\"I'd really like to know what your sympathy card said.\"\"Me too.\"Mom and Freda. Lucy and Ethel.

That's because icky weather was in the forecast again for today. So I got it out of the way just in case. But I DID promise Mom that if the roads weren't bad, I would still come pick her up and drive her over to Bill-Pay Town to get some fries at Rally's.Mom already had one outing this week, when we took her along to get that free computer part. She refused fries that day, but sampled a couple. I knew she wanted some. Even though she didn't ask. When I picked her up today, she (of course) had a story of strange coincidence to relate.\"I heard a car at my mailbox around noon. I looked out, and it was red. My newspaper lady has a red car. I wondered why she was so early, but I figured I'd just wait until I went up to get the mail, and bring in the paper then. I closed the shades and forgot about it. About an hour and a half later, I heard the awfullest noise out front. I looked again. There was a red car revving it's engine, sitting in front of my mailbox! I was starting to get worried. What in the world was going on?\"\"Was it the same car?\"\"I don't know. It was a red car. And I didn't know what it was going to do.\"\"Had it been there the whole time? Or did it come back?\"\"Well, I don't know. I quit looking out, but I didn't hear anything until later. Then I got to thinking...'my friend Freda has a red car. I wonder if she put something in my mailbox?' She's always doing things like that, leaving me food on the porch and not knocking and not telling me.\"\"Like that cinnamon roll that she left on the porch, and you came home and found it, and saw a bite out of it when you went to eat it, and thought a dog unwrapped it to sample it, then wrapped it back up?\"\"Uh huh. So I called her, and she said yes, that she had put a card in the newspaper box for me. When the mail came, I went up and got it and the paper. And would you believe that there was no card in my paper box? Just the paper! I looked and looked. I guess the newspaper lady thought I had put a card in there for her, and she took it! I'll see if I get it back tomorrow. If not, I'll have to ask her about it.\"\"You have more trouble with people leaving and taking random stuff! Good thing she didn't get your three bags of hedgeapples.\"\"Oh, and yesterday I caught the mail lady trying and trying to stuff my medicine package that I've been waiting on for two weeks into my mailbox, and it wouldn't fit, so she BACKED DOWN THE DRIVEWAY! I went out and got the package from her and told her she didn't have to do that.\"\"Good thing she did. Who knows WHEN you would have gotten it if it went back to the post office.\"\"I guess you're right.\"We were in line at Rally's by then. Mom decided that she would like a Diet Coke, also. She had put off making one at home because she knew I was coming by to get her. We were also picking up a meal for The Pony, who was waiting at Mom's house with high-speed internet.\"Here.

He went to see The Pony play on his Smartypants team, and I went to put things in order after an absence today. I tried to haul my work to the room to listen, but we were late, coming from a funeral service, and the match was already in progress.Unlike years past, the contestants were not set up around the teacher desk, backs to the door, leaving room for a small audience to enter and spectate. They were facing the door. Like a semi-circle of tooth-gnashing wolves, a sight a bit off-putting, if not downright pants-wetting. An adult man and woman (as opposed to infant man and woman, I suppose, after writing that and not wanting to back up and erase it) sat on the floor of the hall, backs against the painted concrete-block wall. It appeared that they had abandoned all hope, they who had not entered there. A few sets of parents could be observed, gloating along a wall behind the contestants. They must have camped out overnight for those spots.I started back to my room, and passed Hick, who had just arrived from a stop by his doctor's office for a shot. \"They've already started. I'm not dealing with it. I've go work to do.\"Hick the big dumb doofus brave warrior opened the unlocked door and entered between quarters as substitutes were switched out. When that match was over, he headed to my classroom to await the start of the next round. Having not partaken of our nighttime repast, both Hick and I were feeling a mite peckish. He headed off to seek a machine soda while I remained 44-oz.-Diet-Cokeless.\"Hey, you can go in the teacher workroom. There's a snack machine. And while you're at it, bring me a little pack of that Sweet and Salty Mix. I think it's D4.\" That stuff is tasty, full of sunflower seeds, peanuts, raisins, and generic blank M&Ms. Off Hick went, a modern-day hunter-gatherer, in no danger of being gored by a vending machine while plying it with bills.The Pony came charging through the door. \"We won! By a lot. 270 to 60. I only played three quarters, and I scored 110 points. Here. Dad said to bring these to you.\"\"Wait! Why are there two bags? I only wanted one. I gave him a dollar.

Or, as The Pony might call it, torture. Yes, I waited in the waiting room. It's pretty obvious that's what one is supposed to do in such an area. It's not called the all-you-can-eat buffet room, or the auction-every-Monday room, or the extreme-log-rolling-championship room. A waiting room is for waiting.The parking lot was full of cars, but only one person sat between me and The Pony and privacy. A woman sat near the restroom and inner sanctum door. The Pony and I chose seats in the opposite corner of the room. That's what normal people do. Perhaps you can sense the direction this tale is taking. If not, feel free to jump to the bottom and read about the point in my new feature: Val's Blog Post For the Reluctant Reader.The Pony was called back within five minutes. The Waiter was joined by a man and tweenage boy. Apparently, they were all waiting for a similar boy who was already being polished and readied for release. The tweenager inquired as to why he and one adult couldn't just go home. So the Waiter got up and left with him. The man was summoned to the inside counter to grow a long white beard while the anemic appointment-scheduler caught twenty winks. That left me, myself, and Val to rule the room. Revel in solitude for the first time since 5:00 a.m. But not for long.A new gal came, on decidedly not-little, not-cat feet. She quickly surveyed my kingdom, said, \"This looks good,\" and plopped down in the only cushiony armchair in the place. Which was right beside me, at a 90-degree angle. For those of you who are not friends of Euclid, that means the sitter of that chair faced my side. Were I a football player, and she pursuing me, she would have been the perfect candidate for stiff-arming. I was simply a waiter, though. A waiter in a wait land. A captive with an audience.Armchairy brought nothing to read. Nothing to pass the time during her wait. She was too involved with sniffling. And hacking out phlegm. And breathing. All within reach of Val's throttling hand. I would not have dared touch her, of course. I could only imagine psychedelic swarms of bacteria and viruses swirling down her shirtfront, sliding over her knees like a waterfall, and beginning a surge towards me. I turned my head as far to the left as I could get it, facing the open door to the entrance hall, and tried to suck in untainted oxygen from that side. It was all I could do to keep from jumping out of my chair and charging across the vast waitland to stop stewing in her juices.What the not-heaven is wrong with people?***************************************************************Val's Blog Post For the Reluctant ReaderA coughing woman sat way too close to me in the dentist's waiting room."}, {"title": "Sometimes, Even the Universe's Conspiratory Machinations Are No Match For Goodness", "date": "Tuesday, January 28, 2014", "text": "A most curious event occurred this evening. More unexplainable, even, than the strange goings-on in the Val Thevictorian basement.Last night, The Pony had a mishap. One minute he was happily ensconced on the new basement couch, pecking away at his laptop keyboard...and the next minute his world fell apart. His laptop slid off the edge of that dastardly divan, and hit the pressed-tile-over-concrete-covered-by-a-braided-rug floor. The plug-in thingy that connects to the cable of the power supply broke off in his laptop hole thingy.The Pony was a brave little soldier. He came to my dark basement lair to report the damage. Neither sullen nor tearful was he, but simply resigned. Resigned to the fact that we had traversed the 8th continent of Backroads seeking that power supply. All because the original began emitting smoke one evening last summer. Possible replacements found on the internet all had comments such as: \"I ordered this as a replacement, and after two days, it started smoking!\" Yeah. We did not feel that such a purchase would be prudent. Much calling around resulted in ONE shop, a mere fifteen miles from home, that might possibly have such a rare jewel in stock.The Pony managed to pry the offending stump loose from the hole. \"Now all I need is that little part that sticks in. The power supply itself is fine.\" Fine, indeed. To the tune of fifty dollars.Flash back to last summer...The Pony had felt the purchase well worth that price. The universal power supply unit offered by the TechyGuru store came with an array of ten or more sizes of connectors. The Pony did not have his laptop with him at the store. The counter guru tried to find the size by comparing parts on the old smoky power supply. He said that if the universal unit did not have a connector that fit, we could bring it back for a full refund. He showed The Pony how to change the power output or some such thing that showed up in a green light on the side of the unit. We got it home, and The Pony had it running in less than a minute.Flash back to this evening...The Pony had packed up the whole kit and caboodle this morning at 5:30 a.m. I promised to take him to TechyGuru after school, after my traded duty, after his dentist appointment. TechyGuru was open until six. I was sure we could make it, and we did. The Pony took a deep breath. Grabbed his backpack full of laptop essentials, and headed toward the door. He usually hangs back, but this time he walked right up to the counter.\"Well, it seems I need another power supply. I broke mine off in my laptop last night.\" He removed the laptop and set it on the counter. Took out the strip of accessories and showed the space where the working one had been. \"It's this one I need.\"The counter guru headed to the back room. We heard him talking it over with somebody out of sight. He brought a connector out and tried it. It didn't quite fit tight enough. The Pony dug around in a side pouch on his red laptop backpack. \" Here's what's left of it.\" He took out the miniscule end that had not fallen apart.Counter Guru went to the back room again. We heard some muffled conversation...\"only needs the connector...I don't know...how about five dollars...we have all kinds of them.\" He came back out front and pushed the connector into the hole. It was a perfect fit. He pulled it out and handed it to The Pony. \"There's what you need.\"\"Great! We were hoping you would have one.\"I pulled my household cash reserves from my pocket. \"Thank you! How much will that be?\"\"No charge. We have a bunch of them.\"\"Thank you so much! That's a really nice thing to do. I'll be sure to recommend you to everybody.\"A lady walked in. \"They're the best computer store ever.\"Ain't that the truth!

I think those handbaskets can wait one more day."}, {"title": "I Need To Install Security Cameras In My Kitchen", "date": "Monday, January 27, 2014", "text": "The Pony spent Friday night with his grandma, who dropped him off at bowling league at noon on Saturday. I normally give The Pony his bowling money, but this time I forgot. Hick meets him there, so I knew he would have money for his games, and for lunch. After all, I am the one who doles it out. Hick made sure to inform me on Saturday night that he would be needing reimbursement of his $20 so he could afford his own league on Monday night.Flash forward to Sunday afternoon, when The Pony and I were headed off to town to meet my mom. As I rounded the kitchen counter, The Pony already standing with one hand on the doorknob, I said, \"Wait a minute! I need to leave your dad's $20 before I forget.\" I went back around and laid the bill under one of his unbunched bananas. I turned my back a minute to grab some leftover fortune cookies for Mom. We were already running late, so I hurriedly joined The Pony to make our exit.As we drove down the gravel road, we saw that Hick had his Ford F250, his $1000 Caravan, and his Pacifica all parked in front of the BARn. Who knows what kind of Frankensteining was about to be perpetrated. I know that Hick had left earlier on his Goodwill/home show/tire tour, so I assumed he must have been eenie-meenie-minie-moeing to see which vehicle would need major repairs next.When The Pony and I returned about an hour later, we forgot to spy on Hick across the BARn field. Going up the driveway, all out of sync with our routine because we had left the garage door open as a spring-saving method, we were discombobulated. \"Oh. I forgot I don't need to push the door opener,\" said The Pony, standing, bent at the waist, reaching for the passenger side sun visor from his regular seat behind the driver's. \"Huh. There's Dad's Pacifica. I guess he's home. I didn't notice the van, though. So give me the keys just in case.\" He headed off to carry in some unperishable Walmart spoils from Saturday.Inside the house, I saw that the twenty was gone from under the banana. \"Your dad must be here. His money is gone. Do you see him?\"\"No. Everything's off. The front door is locked. Maybe he's gone in the van, or in the BARn.\"That was as curious as we got. It's not like the temperature was 1 degree. It was upper 50s. For all I knew, Hick might have been cruising around on his Gator. Because nothing spurs a man to tool around in a bright green open glorified golf cart like spending nine hundred dollars on truck repairs three weeks ago, and a couple hundred on tires that very day, all while having a perfectly good Pacifica for driving anywhere, any time. No search party was being mounted by Val Thevictorian.\"Hey! Look what I found in my pocket!\" The Pony pulled a folded twenty from the right front pocket of his camo pants. Not that money means anything to The Pony. He rarely spends. He's not a skimmer like Hick and Genius. \"Where did that come from?\"\"I don't know. Did you wear those pants to the auction with Dad last week? Maybe you left your money in there.\"\"No. I didn't put it in my pocket. It was in my wallet. And I don't know where that is right now.\"\"And I just got those pants off the dryer this morning. They've been washed since then. But that twenty is crisp. I never went through a wash and dry. Huh.\"\"Here. I know it's not mine.\"\"Good. Now I have an extra twenty!\"We went about our Sunday afternoon business. Hick returned with no word of his whereabouts. We ate supper. Went our separate ways again until bedtime. On Monday morning, as I was trying to catch a chair nap while Hick was getting ready to leave, I heard him call from the kitchen, \"Remember, I need my $20 back for bowling.\" I had almost dozed off. Ding dang dong it! Hick always picks the worst times to speak.\"Okay. Because we might not be home before you leave for bowling. Wait! I gave you that twenty yesterday!\"\"No. You may think you did, but you didn't.\"\"Yes I did! Right before The Pony and I left, I laid out a twenty under your bananas. It was gone when we got back. PONY! Didn't I lay out Dad's money when we left for town?\"\"I don't remember you laying it there.\"\"Yes you do! I made you wait by the door. I laid it there right in front of you, under a banana so it wouldn't blow away.\"\"Well, I didn't see you put it there.\"\"I didn't get a twenty.\"\"Get one out of the inside of my purse, where I keep the house money folded, in the back left.\" Several minutes passed. \"Did you get your money?\"\"Well, I'm looking for it. Folded, did you say?\"\"Just bring it in here! Turn on the light! What are you doing?\" Hick had my whole checkbook out, digging through the middle, when any fool knows I keep the house money in the folds of the purse, and not with my allowance inside the checkbook. I grudgingly pried out a twenty for Hick. Off he went. Nap ruined, I picked up the phone to call my mom. WAIT A MINUTE!\"Hold on, Mom. PONY! You picked up that twenty and put it in your pocket, didn't you? The one under the bananas?\"\"I don't remember doing that.\"\"It's the only explanation. Mom, you're not going to believe what I go through around here.\"\"Oh, I believe you.\"And she's not just taking my side because I'm her precious five-dollar daughter to whom she gave not a shred of currency this leftover-donation time."}, {"title": "You Get What I Pay For", "date": "Sunday, January 26, 2014", "text": "This morning Hick took off to check out those automatic-kick-on generators that run on propane from a tank outside your house that will sit there, menacing, ever-ready to blow you sky-high, until just the right instant when its services are needed to supply you with heat/AC and light and computers and TV and washers and dryers and refrigeratiors and ovens and microwaves to warm up and heat food instead of cooking. There was a giant annual home show nearby.Since the home show didn't open for a few hours, Hick informed me that he would be stopping by Goodwill to look for bargains, and then taking his tire for repair. Nevermind that he could have removed the broken spring from the garage so my mom could drop if off and have a new one created on Monday. Hick said he patched that behemoth with a clamp, like he did when HIS garage door spring broke, and it lasted a good six months before we had to deal with it. Uh huh. That was six months of spring and summer. Not below-zero temperatures that are in the forecast again all week. I am going to make Hick open my garage door when he leaves each morning, to make sure that spring doesn't break and trap The Pony and I inside and make us miss school. I would certainly hate to look for keys to the other four vehicles and wonder if they have gas and inflated tires.And speaking of tires...Hick mentioned that the tires on that $1000, 2000 Caravan were in worse shape than he originally thought. WHAT?\"Didn't you just get snow tires put on the van last year?\"\"Yes. ON THE FRONT!\" He said that like any fool would know that you only put snow tires on the front of a 2000 Dodge Caravan. Like that's in the manufacturer's specifications in the owner's manual that nobody ever reads.\"So we didn't get four new tires last year?\"\"No. Just two. On the front. It's a back tire that's flat. They were on it when we bought the van from Missy from work. They weren't her original tires. Bob at work got new tires on his van, and his old ones were better than the ones on Missy's van, so he gave them to her. Then we bought it, and they were those tires.\"\"Huh. Shame he didn't give her a speedometer needle that would actually spin instead of laying on its side at the bottom of that dial.\"\"Whatever. I don't see the point in getting an old tire like that fixed. It's going to need a new tire.\"\"Doesn't that mean you'll have to get TWO new tires?\" Even I know you don't keep one threadbare.\"Yeah. I'm going to need two tires.\"Between car insurance with our two teenage male drivers, and all the Frankenstein parts we've put on that $1000 Caravan, I figure we could have bought a brand new one with the outlay.At least we're saving money on that garage door spring."}, {"title": "The Official Spokesman and the Conclusion-Jumper", "date": "Saturday, January 25, 2014", "text": "Hick is working himself to the bone for no good reason. Why should he crawl around in swarf pits, take machines apart and put them back together, dangle high above the concrete floor on ladders and man-lifts while entwined in electrical wires which he assumes are un-live...when he could simply be the official spokesman for a company with something to hide? Not that Hick is crafty like a fox, or a silver-tongued talker. Or even evasive. Well, I'll concede that Hick attempts to be evasive. But he's no good at it. If his job depended on him being deliberately evasive, he would never win an Oscar.This morning Hick left for work at the regular time, an hour before I arose. He works half days on Saturday, then meets The Pony at the bowling alley for the youth league. I called my mom to see how she and The Pony weathered the night, took a shower, wrote out some bills, paid for Genius's new semester books with an eCheck, and called Garage Door Springs R Us to see if they could solve my new carport predicament. They could not.Just as I was packing up my cell phone to head to Walmart, I got a text from Hick: \"I have a flat tire. I noticed it when I got to First Blacktop Road.\" Oh, dear. Had Hick been sitting in his $1000 Caravan for three hours, waiting for me to wake up and come help him? Surely not. He's smarter than that. In the very least, he would have no qualms about calling and waking me up the minute he needed a ride. So what was he up to now? This tire business could throw a monkey wrench into my plans. I called Hick. He didn't answer. Huh. You'd think he would still have his phone handy. Oh, well. I sent him a text back: \"What do I need to do? Since you won't bother to answer your phone.\" Nothing. Deader than a doornail was my cell.I started out the kitchen door. The house phone rang. I hurried back inside to grab it before the machine picked up. You'd think that Hick would have called me right back on the cell. The one I texted from not two minutes earlier. You see, around here, the cell only works outside or on the main floor. When I'm in my dark basement lair, cows could text me to say, \"Quit dancing. We're coming home.\" And I'd never know. Once I'm in the basement, my cell phone ceases existence. I only answer the house phone. So it should have been obvious to Hick that I was either out about town, or within arm's reach of my cell.Anyhoo, I grabbed that house phone, and one of the most inane conversations of all time this week commenced.\"Why didn't you pick up?\"\"I guess my phone was still on silent. I was in a meeting.\"\"You texted me from a meeting. Then got my text. How could you not know I was calling?\"\"I'm not in a meeting.\"\"Where are you? What do I need to do about your tire?\"\"I'm at work.\"\"How will you get home?\"\"Drive.\"\"Driving on a flat ruins the tire.\"\"I KNOW that.\"\"Well, what are you going to do about your tire?\"\"I'll get it fixed.\"\"Do you have a spare?\"\"I don't know. I might.\"\"Well, how are you getting it fixed?\"\"I'll take it off and get it looked at.\" \"What about The Pony? Do I need to get him from bowling?\"\"No. I'll get him at bowling.\"\"You're getting your tire fixed.\"\"I don't have to do it TODAY.\" \"But how are you getting to bowling?\"\"I'm driving.\"\"You can't drive on a flat tire!\"\"I KNOW that!\"\"But your tire is flat!\"\"Yeah. On my van. In the garage. I drove The Pony's truck.\" \"Then why did you text me about your flat tire?\"\"Just to let you know.\"You'd think, perhaps, that Hick might have let me know from the beginning that he came back and got The Pony's truck, and that eventually he was going to need a tire repair or new tire. But that's not the way Hick's communication skills are wired. He's going to keep this up until I totally disregard any communique that others immune to his ways might see as vital. In simpler times, Hick might have been the boy who cried wolf, only to explain to the villagers that he was merely showing them he knew what to do in case of an attack emergency.Hick.

I'll emphasize it to my fellow Backroadsians who are rocking in front of the cast-iron stove down at Drucker's General Store, whittling corncob pipes, taking a break every now and then to play some checkers, or dip a giant pickle out of the barrel.Spring has sprung! That dastardly giant spring that used to raise the garage door every time T-Hoe's clicker said, \"Open Sesame.\" Now it only raises the garage door one panel. That is not quite enough to let T-Hoe through. A cat, perhaps. But not the fat tuxedo cat doing very little to escape the advances of the beagle.I thought I had hit the clicker twice. That makes the door stop, and go back down. But this one stuck. When I clicked again, it closed. Another click, it went up one panel. I must have sat there on my heated seat trying that about 20 times. Hope springs eternal, you know. But my spring was sprung.I saw the extent of the carnage when I walked all the way around the garage to go in through the people door, and saw that giant spring in two parts. As you might recall, we just replaced that spring on Hick's garage door this summer. So now, during the cold snap, my spring snapped. When Hick got home, he wrestled with that wily coil, and managed to open my garage door all the way, manually. Now we have to leave it open. Which kind of defeats the purpose of having a garage, turning it into a drafty carport. The onus falls on Val to drag the twisty traitor to the garage door store to seek a fabricated replacement.Our infrastructure is failing fast."}, {"title": "Don't Let Anybody Tell You That Cleanliness is Next to Warmthiness", "date": "Thursday, January 23, 2014", "text": "When it comes to cold, I have no shame.I really, really did not want to venture outside to get to work this morning. I was cold all day Wednesday, at a balmy 32 degrees, weather that would have an Ice Road Trucker clomping about in flip-flops, cut-off jeans, and a wife beat\u00a0\u00a0 ribbed sleeveless tank undershirt. I was cold when I got up this morning. Cold making The Pony's lunch. Cold in the shower. Cold out of the shower. Cold under my soft blankie snuggled into the folds of Hick's La-Z-Boy for my morning chair nap. And...cold while sticking an arm out to hold the phone while calling my mom, cold eating breakfast, cold getting dressed.I could take it no more. \"Pony, I'm going to wear my old sweatshirt in the car this morning. I know it is all stretched out. I know it has an orange spot of vegetable beef soup on the baby-blue neck trim. It's just for the car. And the walk into the building under my coat. I'll take it off inside. Then put it back on to come out. Nobody will see it. I have to be warm. I can't drive in a coat.\"Yeah. My old sweatshirt friend rode along to work with me like a second skin. It did nothing to warm my hands in my new Christmas gloves that are two inches too long for my fingers (and, some say, not even MINE), and nothing to warm my feet inside my shoes that felt like blocks of ice. But my core was warm. And my buttocks, too, as soon as the seat heater kicked in, which was not soon enough, if you ask my buttocks. Strike that. You really don't want to hear them talk.I might have to take Baby Blue along for the ride again in the morning. I might even toss him into the washer when I go to bed, and into the dryer when I get up. Hick might be onto something with that \"dry soup\" concept. No dripping, no staining. A clean sweatshirt suitable for more wearings between washings.Though I might miss out on that soupy sustenance if T-Hoe goes off the road and I have to survive in the car for several days."}, {"title": "Abandon Hope, All Ye Who Attend Here", "date": "Wednesday, January 22, 2014", "text": "Well, ain't that a fine kettle of fish?

I read one. It was a letter home, stating that our district WILL BE IN SESSION ON THURSDAY.Yeah. I know you're shaking in horror right along with me. To add insult to the fright, the letter pointed out that other districts were already notifying media that due to the arctic, skin-freezing, Day-After-Tomorrow-like polar vortex headed our way tonight, they would not be in attendance.

Nope. Just an inconvenient day. Like I just had. Today. AND yesterday.Did you ever think you were going to snap a little picture with your phone, just a whimsical air-bendy advertising yellow stick-man dude, while your little Pony was paying for gas at the convenient store that sells neither good Diet Coke nor gas station chicken? So you put down your window, ready the phone, wait until cars drive out of the frame, and SNAP. But instead of the whimsical bendy dude, you just get dude.Ramrod strait. Like he just graduated summa cum laude from finishing school. Or had spinal fusion while you were fumbling with the zoom.This morning, after arising at 4:50 a.m., getting The Pony's lunch ready, showering, and settling down for a chair nap...I got the call that school was canceled for flying snow (heh, heh, I just mis-typed that as \"flying snot\" which is incredibly more interesting that what is to follow).The Pony had put off wheeling the trash dumpster to the end of the driveway until this morning. That's because it's only half the work in the morning, because I pick him up at the end of the driveway. So this morning he had to get dressed by 8:00 instead of spending the day in his pajamas, and put on a real coat, no hoodie, and zip it up and raise the hood and wear gloves to brave the 2-degree wind chill.Hick sent a text for The Pony to go out and feed the chickens and goats, but since he sent it at 6:45 a.m., and The Pony was still abed, I completely forgot until 4:30. Sorry, chickens. Goats, not so much.I was just drifting off for a chair nap at 8:50 when Hick's optometrist (NOT The House of Charlatans Optical Delusions Emporium and Professional Prevaricators Shoppe) called to remind him of his appointment. But they did not mention the date or time. Some reminder. Off with their heads!Soup sounded good for supper, so I combed the cabinets to see if I had the ingredients. Yes. I grabbed some frozen hamburger (not from the pantry, how cold do you think we keep it in here, anyway--you must stop listening to Genius), soup starter mix, and canned veggies. You didn't think I'd actually cook up some Bigguns when canned was available, now did you? Huh. I cranked open the cans with my hand can-opener, aggravating my imagined case of carpal tunnel syndrome, and discovered that the tomato sauce was actually diced tomatoes. Oh, well. That goes good in vegetable beef soup. Then I saw that the green beans were not the short cut, but regular length. Guess people will just have to practice balancing them in a spoon. Oh, and the potatoes were not sliced, but were whole small. I jammed a knife down in that can to diminish them. At least the carrots were just right. Goldilocks will pick them out for her bowl. Hick will be pleased. He can have an easier time eating his tower of soup with a fork. To make up for my tomato sauce, I poured in a small jar of pizza sauce. Nobody will know, after adding my other liquids like Worcestershire, Heinz 57, ketchup, hickory BBQ, steak sauce, minced garlic, and some fresh ground black pepper, and Splenda.Some Red Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuits sounded like they would be tasty with that soup. Round about time for Hick to get home, I whipped up a bowl of dough and plopped them into my oven with a non-heating bottom heating element. I put the butter in the microwave for melting, getting it ready to stir in that garlic powder that came in a packet. Meanwhile, I Frankensteinized a Walmart big salad for The Pony. He only likes the lettuce and cheese, not the strips of chicken and bacon bits included in the Ranch Cobb. Hick arrived, and said he did not want any salad, so I set out the chicken and bacon and half egg for Juno, because we were on that salad's third day.The biscuits looked done. I called to Hick to get his serving first, thus making it easier for The Pony and me to dip out some liquid for our soup. He rushed in like Man-O-War out of the gate, dished up his soup with a slotted spoon, and commandeered three Cheddar Bays. As The Pony was adding more ground pepper and salt to his cup o' soup, I put the finishing touches on his salad. The Pony was ogling the biscuits. That's when I remembered. THERE WAS NO BUTTERY GARLIC TOPPING ON THE CHEDDAR BAYS!I grabbed the liquid gold from the microwave and ripped open that packet. Sent The Pony to Hick in his recliner, where he had retired after a hard day's work to feed on his delectable soup tower with his feet up. \"Tell Dad his biscuits have been recalled for lack of garlic butter.\" I slathered them up and sent them back. The Pony chose three biscuits for himself, after gladly painting them with butter from a BBQ brush.\"Hey, we have some garlic butter left. Can I just take that and dip my biscuits in it?\" Genius does not call The Pony a Butterton for nothing.\"Sure. Knock yourself out.\"\"I'm only taking three biscuits, because I have quite a lot of food here.\"Oh, to be 15 again.

But I'm a realist.Just before leaving on Saturday, he went to the laundry room to gather his wardrobe. The wardrobe I so lovingly tended when he was here, hanging his cotton shirts so they wouldn't shrink into revealing midriff tops, carefully sorting colors, bleaching the whites. The wardrobe Genius tossed all willy-nilly into the giant Whirlpool, proclaiming, \"Our washer is so great! I can get all my clothes in it. At school, the washers are tiny. It takes me two or three loads to get it done every week.\"Yeah. No lover of Whirlpool am I. Val's a Sears Kenmore gal. I would have used mine for a lifetime, even though only one of the three wash settings worked, after that unfortunate inundation of broken-pipe water in my old house that came halfway up Kennie's body, like floodwater in that insurance commercial with the dude reading the paper and the kid playing on the floor and their dog unaware that he would soon need to get to paddling. Hick declared that we had an issue with Kennie after a brief spate of leakage, and made me go that very morning to the Whirlpool store and buy a floor model, which is too deep for Val to reach the bottom for errant socks glued to the spinner, even though upon installing Whirly, he discovered the problem was in the cold water connection, and went another four months before fixing it.But we're not here to complain about Hick today. There are 364 more days for that in the upcoming year. We're here to discuss Genius's newest obsession:SILVER WIRE HANGERS!\"Mom. Don't let Dad throw any more of these away! I need them. Do you know they don't make them any more? You can't find them anywhere. I went to Walmart in College Town, because I ran out of hangers, and all they had was those stupid plastic ones. They're crap! I had to pay 98 cents for eight of them!\"\"Yeah. I hate those plastic ones. I gain a classroom cabinet full of them every year on graduation night. I knew you liked the big wire hangers. That's why I put The Pony's shirts on the small ones. So what if his shoulders slope. I knew you liked those special silver ones, but I thought Dad only got a couple of them at random.\"\"No! Every time you guys are gone, I go into your closet and take them. One time, I caught him THROWING AWAY A WHOLE SET OF THEM! Don't ever let him do that again!\"\"Well, he gets whatever the uniform company gives him. And he never takes the dirty clothes back on hangers. So he gets too many.\"\"Save the silver ones for me!\"\"Okay. I'll try to remember.\"That boy was quite emphatic.

He packed up his little red truck and hit the road, first gassing up, getting a mom-sponsored car wash to cleanse the Backroads mud from his ride, visiting Walmart to procure a few supplies, and running by his grandma's to say goodbye. He was in no hurry, you see, because he wasn't allowed back in the dorm until Sunday. However, the mind of Genius is always cranking, the gears never get a rest. He hypothesized that since incoming freshmen were allowed on campus Thursday,  the newcomers would not get one key for three days, then a new one on Sunday. The locks on the dorm would most likely have been changed out Wednesday. He knew that the desk would not be staffed after 8:00 p.m. So he could just let himself in, no one the wiser, and if he was caught, the worst that could happen was that he'd be charged $25 to sleep in his own room for one night. And he would be avoiding the move-in chaos of Sunday.Oh, Genius had a backup plan. He had a contact inside who could let him in if the key didn't work. And worst case scenario, he knew someone in another dorm that was open. I had to explain that to my mom, who was wringing her hands that Genius might do something foolish if he couldn't get in, like sleep in his truck, and freeze to death. She was elated when I reported that he called and said he was on the inside, that his key worked as planned. The old gal might have even celebrated with a bowl of slaw.This afternoon, the phone rang. It was Genius. I was certain he was calling to tell me how much he missed me, and just wanted to hear my voice. Can you believe that was not the reason? Genius was calling from Walmart.\"Mom. I forgot my fleece blanket. The gray one on my bed. I'm looking for one at Walmart, and I can't find them. Where did you get it? What part of the store?\"\"Well...it's in the bedding. In housewares. In our store, it was down at the end of the mattress covers and blankets. Near the towels, where it switches over to dishes.\"\"Uh huh. I'm here at the blankets. I found one that says it's a fleece, but it's not SOFT! And besides, it's $20, so that's not happening.\"\"There were a bunch of them just before Christmas, rolled up, all different patterns. Maybe they're on the clearance aisle. Can you ask somebody?\"The phone went dead. Perhaps a blue-vest walked by, and Genius needed to snag her with a shepherd's crook. Don't think Genius is the kind of guy who won't ask. When he was barely in kindergarten, he was always wandering off from me in Walmart to ask the electronics workers if they'd gotten in any new hard drives, or if they had Linux. Too late to call 1-800-BAD-MOM on me. Besides, that's not enough numbers.\"Mom? My call dropped. I found one. But it's a leopard print. That's the only style.\"\"You can get that one.\"\"Uh, no. Not leopard.\"\"You could use it until I can send your other one. Want me to mail it to you?\"\"Yes. Mail it.\"So...tomorrow Hick is going to take it to work in an old Amazon box and ship it to that poor shivering boy who only has a comforter to comfort him.Funny how the whole time he was here, Genius complained how frigid our house is at 69 degrees, and how he wished he was back at school where the dorm is a normal temperature, well into the seventies."}, {"title": "Forget Dogcatcher.

But, like a tree falling in a forest with no one there, making no sound...nobody stopped me and accused me. That must mean that I am not a criminal. Pound that gavel. Case dismissed.Today I searched high and low in Walmart for TurboTax. Okay. I searched wide and wider. It's usually in a special glorified cardboard box display in the back aisle. I was without my partner in dime-spending, because The Pony was competing in a tournament against 16 other Smartypants teams from around the state. I had nearly broken my arm patting myself on the back for not needing to roll my cart/walker to the pharmacy end of the store. All I really needed there were some foaming denture tablets to lift the tea stain out of the two cups Genius has been using to brew his Christmas present of a five-tin tea assortment. I figured, with him leaving today, nobody would be using those two cups for a while, so it could wait. The farthest afield I had to go was the paper plate aisle. Just a hop, skip, and a jump from the food section.Then I remembered the TurboTax. It's not that I'm planning on firing off my tax return tonight. But if I get the urge to start working on it, I want that disk an arm's length away, at my fingertips. I trudged across the back aisle, past the pallets of toilet paper, past the dog beds, past the books, past the lay-a-way/bathroom area, past the DVD section, past the electronic accouterments, past the TVs, to the area where I found TurboTax on a regular shelf last year. Of course it was not there. I went on, into the computer games. Up the aisle to the camera and phone counter. Past the folks with uniform polo shirts in non-private thigh-high cubicles doing people's taxes for them, down a parallel non-through aisle. Aha! Getting closer. There was a cheap-looking cardboard display of H&R Block software. I don't think so. No need to teach this old dog new tricks. I sniffed all around the area like those pooches looking for bacon on the Beggin' Strips commercial. Huh. No TurboTax. I went back to the main aisle, tired of the chase, ready to throw in the towel.There it was! On a glorified cardboard display case. Three flavors of TurboTax. I grabbed the one that Goldilocks would choose. The one that is just right. Deluxe, I think it's called. Not basic. Not premier. I tossed it on top of my coat on top of the child-seat area. I start out putting things in there, so as not to possibly lose a pound over the course of the year from bending over the main section of the cart unnecessarily. Thing is, I first stuff stuff down in there, then flop my coat back over until that little area is full, then pile it on top of my coat. Some days I can get by with nothing in the main cart. But that's usually at Save A Lot.I really had more stuff that my list revealed. Thank goodness the check-out lines were virtually non-existent. I piled on my tabloids and bellied right up to the conveyor. Regurgitated my selections, placing frozen with frozen, boxes with boxes, soft with soft, produce with produce. You know, to make it easier for the checker. So she didn't have to think about what to bag together. I put TurboTax with the tabloids. Dry. Flat. Could share space with boxes if need be.Huh. Wouldn't you know it? I had a checker designed by Rodin! Heh, heh. At first I typed \"Rodan.\" It didn't look right, so I summoned my BFF Google. I don't want to appear as ignorant as I really am. Anyhoo...my checker kept three bags going on that carousel before she would spin it and proffer them to me. My classification system was not good enough for her. Still, she did a more-than-adequate job. Unlike the many checkers I've had who were indeed designed by RODAN! The horror!After paying, I was momentarily sidetracked three steps toward the door by a guy in the 20 items or less aisle hollering, \"Hey!\" It was my old custodian. He left his wife minding the items, and came to have a short chat, ask about Genius, The Pony, and Mabel. He looked good. Said he was busy all the time, keeping up with the kids at basketball games, and his granddaughter who is quite a talented athlete in another sport. He looked over his shoulder and his wife was giving him THE LOOK. So he excused himself. I guess he paid or put the items in the cart, so next thing I know, I'm walking toward the exit door, through that vast vestibule where the Subway is located, pumping out that fresh bread smell, past the electronic thief-sensor.IT STARTED BING-ING!I stopped. There was no cheerful sexagenarian to greet me and ask for my receipt. I stopped. Looked behind me, like, \"Was that ME?\" I'm sure I will be nominated for best People of Walmart actress during the next Oscar cycle. Vote for me if you're a member of the academy, 'kay? The sensor-tripper must have been TurboTax. I know Rodin's The Checker rang it up. I saw her slide it across just before the tabloids. I guess she didn't demagnetize it. I doubt it was on purpose. She didn't seem the type to set my up for a fall.Here came my OC. He was chatty again. I took one backward, \"I'm not guilty\" glance, and wheeled my walker/cart out the door.I know I paid. It was on the receipt when I looked after loading my purchases in T-Hoe's rear compartment. I even stood around a bit, taking my time, in case a blue-vested loss prevention specialist came after me.Nobody cared.

I spent my whole planning period on the phone with those fraudsters at Banishment Well-Being Concern concerning their refusal to process my insurance claims. Never mind that I've spoken to them three times since December 20, and each time was assured that the info I provided would take care of the problem. At first, they just needed the start date of Hick's current policy, which we've had for two years now, my secondary, because they thought IT was my primary, because there's no number like 01, 02, or 03 at then end of the policy number for the members on his family plan. After I tracked that down, they said my claims would process. The next time, they said the note with the info was in the file, they were just waiting for the people to get around to reprocessing. So here's today's runaround.Banishment Well-Being Concern is not paying because now they say I must provide a TERMINATION DATE for insurance I had that started Jan. 1, 2007. Otherwise, they assume I am still covered by this insurance company, which they now say is through my very own current employer, which is the one paying the premiums for Banishment Well-Being Concern to be my primary insurance. It's a regular ouroboros. An O. Henry tale from the health care field. Oh, what a wicked web they weave! Then they act like I AM THE ONE BEING UNREASONABLE and trying to deceive!To start with, I told that treacle-y sweet-talker that under no circumstances have I ever had insurance take effect on January 1, because my employer is a SCHOOL, and our policies always take effect on July 1. She hemmed and hawed about looking at the wrong screen. The wench put me on hold again for ten minutes, while she probably stepped outside for a smoke and a Krispy Kreme. They know they are being recorded, so they get all polite in a passive-aggressive way and give a long pause, and say, \"Would you like me to check on that date to make sure?\" Um. Yeah. Because there's no way that's right. She came back after running down to the Seven-11 for a burrito and a Big Gulp, and said, \"Oh, that WAS the effective date.\"When I complained that since July 1 (imagine that) they had not paid my claims, Sugar Lips said that wasn't true, she only saw two claims from December they hadn't paid, conveniently leaving out all the prescription issues I had for four months, and that the whole process was held up because I had not provided the needed information. I washed my hands of her and called the main office of my employer to see if they, perchance, had the termination date of an insurance policy from seven years ago. Nope. But they can send a letter declaring that they are paying for Banishment Well-Being Concern to insure me since July 1 this year, and that there is absolutely no other policy in effect that could be considered my primary. That's the backup plan.I called our company insurance rep, who grinds the bones of these giants to make her bread. Of course she was on the phone, and I was down to my last five minutes of plan time. So I fired off an email with pertinent names and details.No wonder people go without health insurance.

I certainly hope a vent fan light mouse did not set up residence without my knowledge, catch Hick's attention, fall out upon further investigation, and cavort with cartoon cuteness about the facilities before being dispatched by Hick's bare hands.

My employer is taking a beating by paying these premiums for nothing.I can't wait to see what angle they will take now. I have to gather my trunk full of correspondence, and write down my reference number and the names of the three people I have talked to since December 20, all to no avail, because Banishment Well-Being Concern continues to deny that they are responsible for any claims. I never thought I'd have to prove that I DON'T have coverage with a specific insurance company in order to get my rightful, employer-provided policy to pay.

Diet Coke. Never mind that I'd had one nearly every single day of my overlong vacation. I actually do not partake during the work week. But I saw no need to go cold turkey on the very first day back.Perhaps I've mentioned the exorbitant price increase in 44 oz. Diet Cokes at the gas station chicken store. FIFTY CENTS MORE! That's Backroads robbery! For that very reason, I turned up my nose at the gas station chicken aroma, and headed for Voice of the Village, where I can get my magical elixir refilled at the rate of eighty cents, or free if the right person is working. Val has connections, you know.So I grabbed my refill cup and headed inside, leaving The Pony to tend to T-Hoe, and promising him a bottle of Sprite. He only has about one a week. I bellied up to the soda fountain, filled my cup one-third full of crushed ice, and stuck it under the Diet Coke spigot. I was busying myself by wiping up a previous customer's drippings with the wet rag those clerks so kindly leave on the counter, when I glanced at my vessel and saw a stream of clear liquid cascading down. I'd shoved it under the Sprite spigot, by cracky! The one just to the left of the Diet Coke. I was a bit off-kilter, leaning over with the wipe rag. What to do, what to do? Of course I dumped out all that Sprite, and the ice as well. Can't have Sprite ice in a Diet Coke. It disturbs the palate.I did not feel guilty about dumping. It looked like I was not the first one with that idea. There was a mini mountain of discarded ice across the grate of the soda fountain. I clunked in some fresh ice, and looked dead on to make sure I was pushing back the Diet Coke lever with the edge of my cup. Then I moved the wipe rag back over by the lid and straw cubbies. No sooner did I turn my attention back to the soda stream than the reality hit me.THERE WAS STILL A CLEAR STREAM OF SODA FILLING MY 44 OZ. CUP!Time slowed. I think I heard myself bellow \"NOOOOOO!\" in that deep, draggy slo-mo sound effect. I may or may not have used my free hand to do half a Home Alone boy aftershave imitation of The Scream.Well. Ain't that a fine box of not-chicken? I poured that foul fluid, plus ice, out of my cup and grabbed a bottle of Sprite for The Pony from the cooler. At the counter, I tilted my empty cup. \"I didn't get a refill. Your Diet Coke is running clear. It must be out.\"\"Is our Diet Coke out?\"\"It's not out!\"\"Well, it's clear. Not the way it should be.\"The \"It's not out!\" gal went to check behind the scenes. A regular Oz was she, in back of the long double fountain, pulling all the levers, calling all the shots. I paid for The Pony's bottle of Sprite and left, a bad taste in my mouth. As if my day had not been hard enough, now Even Steven was busting my chops over a 44 oz. Diet Coke. I headed for my old Coking grounds. Filled my cup. Stepped up to the counter, ready to lose my shirt. There was no avoiding it.\"I wasn't paying attention. Was that a refill?\"\"Yes. You might notice by the red Cherry Limeade stain around the top rim, and the scuff marks around the bottom. Believe me, I tried to go get an eighty-cent refill at your competitor, but they were out of Diet Coke.\" I tossed two dollar bills on the counter, no correct change from Val anymore, to show my displeasure with their price-gouging measures instigated at the start of the new year.\"That will be a dollar thirty-seven. Out of two dollars. Sixty-three cents back. Oh! Did you get your straw?\"\"No. I have other straws. But I guess I should make sure to take one every time I come in. For a dollar thirty-seven.\" I think my sarcasm was lost on this one, the elder cranky lady who says every part of the transaction out loud.Handbaskets. Factory coming soon."}, {"title": "Like a Woodpecker's Beak Through Dead Timber, So Are the Nights of My Life", "date": "Monday, January 13, 2014", "text": "I went to bed early last night. It was no later than midnight-thirty. That's early for me, the night owl, usually roosting around 3:00 and sleeping in for a good six hours, whether I need it or not. No reason to get up early those 23 days between school ending for Christmas break, and school beginning after the Polar Vortex.I was counting on being well-rested. Especially since my back-to-school headache started on Sunday, not on Monday. Yep. Catch a few winks, let that old headache fade away, and start fresh at 4:50 a.m. Monday morning. That was the plan. Perhaps not the best-laid plan, but it still managed to go awry.Now that the dreaded moisture barrier mattress cover has been ripped from my pillow-topper for a couple of weeks, I was looking forward to a comfy snooze. Sure, I knew the sheet would still be way over my head, and mist would be spraying from Hick's breather. Those were small potatoes compared to the Biggun of that crackly unfitted mattress cover.Then I laid me down to sleepNo flannel quilt upon my feetA single hour before I was wakedAcross the coals Hick will be rakedAh...I was sawing major logs. Logs as numerous and girthy as those floating down the river when even Paul Newman could not save cousin Joby, trapped under one of those behemoths, in Sometimes a Great Notion. Then I was startled out of my stupor by three giant words: \"THOSE STUPID DOGS!\"Never mind that I hear those hounds barking their fool heads off for nothing every early morn. Do I shout out my critique of their home defense prowess? No, I do not. Did Hick haul himself out of be to look outside and see if his trailer was being towed away by early birds? No, he did not. But I did. I went to the front door to see what was the matter. Nothing. My sweet, sweet Juno came running to the door for petting. I was of a good mind to bring her in and plop her between me and Hick, her feathery tail brushing across his quilt-covered breather. But I did not. She was happy, and returned my figurative paw de-thorning with several blessed moments of silence. I went back to sleep.One hour later, I was jolted away by a kick from a mule. Or a horse-donkey. It's a regional thing. Funny how when I fell asleep, I had no idea that I was sleeping with a horse-donkey. What a powerful rump you have, dear horse-donkey! I know. The better to dislocate your knee, my dear. Uh huh. That's what if felt like. My right knee bent inward, toward my left knee. The joint is not configured that way. It was quite painful. I think I may have lost consciousness, because the next thing I knew, I was counting the elusive ZZZZs.Another short hour later, and I was beset with a disturbed nest of TrackerJackers. Oh, wait! That was Katniss in The Hunger Games. She escaped with minor injuries. I, however, was not so lucky. Again with my right leg. It was stabbed over and over by the raptor-claw of Hick the Prehistorian. I think he was trying to break Lizzie Borden's whack record. Such a pummeling I took. Yet I tried to shake it off. To drift back to dreamland. Hick was having none of it. He began piercing my side-tibia flesh with his talon like a famished woodpecker seeking sustenance. Great Googly Moogly! I tried not to be a Nancy Kerrigan, and managed to stifle my, \"WHYYYY?\" But I am not so stoic as Patrick Swayze in Roadhouse, stitching up my own beer-bottle-slashed flesh with a common sewing needle and cotton thread. I had to get up and walk it off.It was now 3:30 a.m. Still time left to lay slack-jawed with drool escaping the downhill corner of my gaping maw. Please. Spare me the lamentations of those who simply cannot fall asleep. I can fall like a Wallenda with an inner-ear infection, and continue falling like Brendan Fraser, Josh Hutcherson, and Anita Briem through the schist on their Journey to the Center of the Earth. AND THEY'RE STILL FALLING! My problem is that somebody keeps breaking my fall.I got up and checked on the barking dogs again. I did not shout out, \"THOSE STUPID DOGS!\" That is not Val's style. I did, however, fling back the quilt as I re-entered my flannel-covered pillow-top. Sometimes, the leading edge has a way of commanding Hick's attention."}, {"title": "What Cools Down Must Heat Up", "date": "Sunday, January 12, 2014", "text": "Lest you think our school administrators here in Backroads are a fool-hearty bunch of lily-livered classtime-shunners, cancelling educational opportunities all willy-nilly...let the record show that it has been darn cold down in these parts.Our 12 inches of snow had little opportunity to melt during last week's deep freeze. In fact, the meltage didn't really get underway until Friday night into Saturday morning. Here's a couple views of our creek. While the roads had been treated, and the chemicals finally unthawed and began their dutiful road-clearing, nobody told the creek water a thaw was in effect.As the creek rose from the meltage, the top cracked and began to flow toward the river. You may not be able to see the thickness from this photo. I know I don't take good pictures. I am not a photographer. It does not help that my phone situation is always a year late and a lens-cover short, what with me getting cast-offs from Genius when he uses our upgrade to get himself a new phone. I apologize. I know it's enough to make you squint and call for an appointment at The House of Charlatans Optical Delusions Emporium and Professional Prevaricators Shoppe, in hopes of getting some working bifocals within 30 days and 8 visits.The thickness of that ice is about 8 inches. There are two layers, a cloudy layer and a clear layer. Must depend on how fast that water froze, and the oxygen content in it at the time. Here's a look at a smaller section up against the edge of the low-water bridge.I suppose the water might have been running over the bridge earlier, and the icebergs got caught. I'm certainly glad I was not driving the Titanic to town. I had asked The Pony to get me couple of snapshots on his way to bowling, but apparently he missed the whole point of, \"Get me some pictures of those big ice chunks Dad says are on the bridge.\"So...there you have a good view of the left and right sides of the creek, taken from the cab of The Pony's truck. He might have been all discombobulated, what with having to actually ride in the front seat, and not pretend he was a ritzy passenger with a chauffeur, looking to get his hands on some Grey Poupon at a stoplight.Looks like we're off to school on Monday, where we shall remain until after Memorial Day.

Her own house, not mine! Val is not one to shoo her own mater out the door with a kitchen broom like a common house cat. For a brief instant, I was afraid I would have to pluck her out like the nutmeat of a pecan from the bitter shell, with a pointy silver nutpick.We had prearranged her exodus, no small feat, our planning stages, which I have previously compared to mounting the invasion of Normandy. Mom was certain the incoming rain would melt the eight inches of snow coating her gravel driveway. The driveway I am not allowed to enter. The driveway she begrudged the footprints of her neighbors bringing in her mail and newspaper during the -45 degree wind chill days. I tried to reason with Mom. \"That snow is not going away overnight. The temperature today is in the low thirties. It's going to take a while to melt.\"\"Oh, I'm sure it will be gone Saturday. Saturday I'm getting out to go to the bank. I really need to cash these two little checks that have been laying around here since the first of the month. And I want to take some coins to trade in. Then I really need to go by the Post Office to send in my estimated taxes, and to get some stamps. Well. I still have 13 stamps left. But I like to always have some on hand.\"\"I'll come by and take you today. Just in case it's not melted by Saturday. You'll be kicking yourself if you put it off and you can't get out. I'm giving you that chance now.\"\"Well...it's going to rain, and I know my driveway will melt. You don't need to come out here and get me. It's out of your way.\"\"Mom. I'm off work. I'm coming to town anyway. And I won't pull in your precious driveway!\"\"Oh. Well, I can meet you at the end of the driveway. I'll bring my broom, and stay in those footsteps.\"We left The Pony at her house, downloading game updates. He didn't have to seem so happy to get away from me. He helped Mom up the driveway, she and her broom, and her Walmart bag full of checks and mail and clutch purse. Mom lives on an outer road. Because I was not allowed in her driveway, I had to catch a leg of the two-lane highway to get back to where I started from. I am not fond of highway driving, even though (or because) I used to drive myself to the city every day across multiple lanes to work. But I did it, for Mom. She kindly offered her neighbors' driveways for me to turn around, which kind of seemed like dirty pool, after they'd been looking out for her. It didn't look like they were \"saving\" their driveways, but I didn't want to be so bold.We ran our errands and picked up a Diet Coke for Mom at McDonalds. According to mom, a lady in the bank looked at her like she was crazy. \"So I just left. I don't care what they think of me. I was telling that lady that always helps me, the one who got back my ten dollars that drive-thru teller shorted me that time, that I had not been out of the house in so long, I hoped I was in the right place. And that other lady just stared at me. So I left.\" Good thing that lady didn't know what was to come.I dropped off Mom and picked up The Pony. I sat in the car, mind you, because I am not allowed in Mom's driveway. It's not like I can park on the wrong side of the road and go in for a visit. The Pony had accomplished his downloading. We headed home. I called Mom later to tell her we were in the house safely. She calls if she doesn't hear from us. Her phone rang, but she didn't answer. Her thingy came on to say the line was in use. I figured she was talking to one of her long-winded friends. Then she called me back.\"I saw you tried to call. I was on the line with the cable company. I hit something on my remote, and now I can't get a picture, only a blue screen. I've tried everything. That lady didn't know what she was doing. She has this so messed up. I told her about how I use one remote to turn the TV and cable off and on, and the other one for the channels. Nothing would do her but to get on the internet and try to find that remote. She said she had never heard of that kind of TV. You could tell she didn't really want to help me. So I finally just told her, 'I'll figure it out. Never mind.' I'm going to call back later this afternoon to see if somebody else will answer. Oh, this is really bothering me. Like how it bothered you today when your insurance wouldn't pay for your medicine because they say they're not your insurance. That's how I feel.\"\"You need to call back and ask to talk to someone else. If you get that lady, say, 'I tried everything you told me, but it didn't work. Can I please talk to somebody else?' The worst they can do is yell at you and not help you. They can't reach through the phone. You call them back.\"I gave her a couple of hours, then I checked on her again. \"Did you get somebody else at the cable office?\"\"Yes. But you could tell she did not want to help me, either. She acted like she was helping me, but then she said, 'I really don't know what to tell you. I'm going to send a serviceman out there.' And I told her not to send a serviceman.\"\"Why, because he'll pull into your driveway? Let them send one. Tell them to stay out of the driveway.\"\"I don't want a serviceman. Who knows what they'll charge me for that. Oh, it's such a mess. Ever since your sister's boy put it on the full screen that time, I've had trouble with it. I think I'll just watch my upstairs TV in the bedroom until Monday, then I'll go buy another TV.\"\"MOM! You've only had that TV about a year. It's not the TV! You'll just get another remote you have to deal with.\"\"Yes, but maybe that cable remote your sister gave me for Christmas will work with the new remote.\"\"I don't think that's the solution. Genius is gone, or I'd have him come out and fix it for you.\"\"Oh, I don't want to bother him! I don't want to talk about it any more.\"\"Does your remote have a \"MODE\" button? Or say \"TV\" or \"Satellite\" or \"DVD\"?\"\"Yes...it has \"CBL\" which I guess means cable.\"\"Try pushing the \"CABLE\" one.\"Okay. That didn't work. I don't even want to deal with it.\"\"PONY! Did you mess with Grandma's remote and put it on something else? No? Well, get on the phone and see if you can help her.\"\"I tried what Pony said, but that didn't help.\"\"I'll send Hick by tonight on his way home.\"\"No! I don't want to deal with it. I'll watch upstairs.\"\"Mom. You just got a new recliner. You know how you like to lean back and do your Sudoku books and watch TV. I'll send him by. I'll tell him not to pull in your driveway!\"\"NO! Please don't! I'm done with it. Just let it go. Please!\"\"Okay...talk to you later.\"She was really adamant about not having Hick's help. Not that I blame her, but remotes ARE the domain of the weaker male sex. I discussed it with him when he got home. While I was in the kitchen, he picked up the phone and called Mom. \"No. I won't come out. I was just trying to help. I'm looking at ours. Does it have...\"After several minutes, I went in and took the phone. \"Mom. I have five minutes while supper is cooking. Are both lights on? The power for your TV, and for the cable? Do you have a box for cable? We have a light that comes on our receiver when the power it on.\" Mom hemmed and hawed with each suggestion. \"Mom. You're not even downstairs, are you?\"\"No. I was just trying to answer the way I remembered. I'll go down there. I'll have to leave this phone off the hook...\"\"That's fine. You'll be right back up there. I only have three minutes left.\"\"Okay. Here I am with the remotes.\"\"Now...on the TV remote that you use for power...is the power on?\"\"No. I turned it off. When I turn it on, all I get is the blue screen, and a little thing up in the right corner, but not that thing in the bottom corner.\"\"You're going to turn on the power, then we'll try the power on the cable remote.\"\"Okay...I'm turning on the power to my TV remote...wait a minute! Is it coming on? OH! It's working! Everything is working! Thank you! Thank you! This is great! I can watch TV down here tonight. And I'm not turning it off! It can stay on all night, so I'll have it tomorrow!\"\"You're welcome, Mom. I have to go finish supper. Don't forget to hang up your upstairs phone.\"Yeah. Val is a freakin' electronics genius!"}, {"title": "This Is Why We Can't Shop On a Snow Day", "date": "Friday, January 10, 2014", "text": "You might recall that on Wednesday, I ventured out for the first time since the most recent big snow, and headed to Walmart. A trip which was quite fruitful, supplying me with some sour grapes to stomp here.I was in line for 20 minutes. There's a reason for that. More than just the festive snow-day retail circus to which I had a free ticket. The store was not crowded. Are you kidding? Traveling those frozen roadways was harder than running across a buttered tile floor with grape jelly on your feet. Not that I've ever tried it.Three registers were open, and a couple of those 20 items or less short counters. The shoppers were not women alone or with a toddler in the cart-seat. The shoppers were whole families. Or at least man/woman combos. I only saw a handful of people shopping singularly. Getting to the store was a production. Most people had carts piled to the top, even though I'm sure they had stocked up with bread and milk before the storm.I headed for my favorite register on the end, but a man and woman had two carts filled with huge bales of toilet paper. I swear, each pack must have held 27 rolls. I'm not sure if they were feeling a bit...um...indisposed...or if they ran a business, or if they were on hidden camera, Extreme Couponing. There were two more couples with carts ahead of them, so I moved down to the only other open checker on that end. Sure, the two couples ahead of me had loaded carts, and the single woman directly in front of me also had a tall load. Still. It was six of one, a half-dozen minus one of the other. I settled down to wait.A guy pulled up behind me, also eschewing the TP People. I had already waited five minutes by the time he pulled up. We waited another five. The TP People advanced one cart, just as I let out a heavy sigh. Nobody fails to contain her displeasure in public like Val. The old man behind me said, \"That one's moving. Go ahead.\" What a gentleman. Perhaps these are NOT such troubling times in the kingdom.\"Oh, no. You go ahead. I started over there, then switched. I'm not going back.\"The old guy moved on over. I continued to wait. I couldn't even while away the one-third hour by reading tabloids. Not because I already had that week's tabloids, but because there were no tabloids. A couple of gone-to-seed roadie-looking dudes were switching out the racks. Because if there's one thing Walmart needs, it's a new and different kind of rack to hold the tabloids. Except they don't. Because the old racks and new racks looked pretty much identical.I was so bored that, for just a moment, I quit dwelling upon my own misery. The checker was holding up newspaper ads with every product she scanned. Great Googly Moogly! I must have been right about that Extreme Couponing theory. Ol' Savey Stacy was chatting about each item. The couples would nod. Grab a bag as it was slowly filled. Oh, well. Times are tough. I couldn't begrudge folks their savings. I just found it odd that so many customers had come out in the snow for comparison pricing.Once the two couples were finally served, the singleton ahead of me unloaded her cart for close conveyor scrutiny. Again with the savings. Near the end of her items, as my stuff behind the divider bar was inching ever-closer, Savey Stacy held an item aloft. It was an airline-travel-size bottle of alcohol. Pink. There's a box display of them between the deli and the vegetables.\"Is this any good? I haven't seen Watermelon!\"\"I don't know. It's not for me.\"\"This is the best! Blue Raspberry mixed with lemonade!\" Savey Stacy held up a blue tiny bottle. \"I used to work in Backroads at a convenience store. They had these, so I just took some home and tried them.\"\"Huh. I'll recommend that one.\" Singleton was a good sport. Thank goodness she didn't seem to be an alcoholic with the shakes, or a sneak-drinker trying to make her intended purchase inconspicuous like a tweenager with a box of tampons. And when she said she \"took them home\" I'm hoping Savey Stacy meant she paid for them first. Or not. Which could explain why she no longer worked there.Finally. It was my turn. I'd almost given myself scoliosis leaning on the handle of my cart/walker. I was glad I'd sent The Pony on out to T-Hoe after the first ten minutes of waiting. There was no joy in gamevillle after Pony had spent out. He was wandering around looking at other games. Some days I take in a couple of extra bucks, but he'd told me in the car that he didn't need any more. \"We'll be done too soon with that short list. I don't want you to wait while I play.\" He's a gem, my little Pony.As she started scanning my necessities, Savey Stacy picked up her sale ad. Wait a minute! I was not asking for savings! I only wanted to get out of there. \"Huh. Did you have the Apple-Smoked Bacon?\"\"No. Just regular.\"\"Oh. Because Country Mart has a deal on Apple-Smoked, and I could have saved you a dollar.\"\"That's okay. I've been in line a while. I just want to get going.\"\"Is this hard to make?\" Savey Stacy held up my Red Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuit mix.\"No. It's like Bisquick. You just add grated cheese and water to the mix, bake it, then brush the powder stirred into melted butter over it.\"\"My friend made it, and she said it takes a long time.\"\"No. It's like drop biscuits. Push it off the spoon, and bake for 14-16 minutes. Easy. My kids loved them.\"\"Huh. There. Save A Lot has a deal on bananas. I saved you sixty cents.\"I'm sure the people behind me in line were heavily sighing."}, {"title": "Who or What, Exactly, Goes There!", "date": "Thursday, January 9, 2014", "text": "Genius left Wednesday morning to gallivant around various cities, a trip to culminate Saturday with an all-day booth-hosting gig at some technology rendezvous where he and other members of his college solar car team can possibly secure additional sponsors for their bright endeavor. He packed his gear and headed out into the frozen wasteland, not even looking back. \"I'm only going to be gone four days,\" he said, as if he was merely running down to the mailbox to interrogate the rural carrier as to the whereabouts of various missing packages.Wednesday night, I heard a regular hoe-down above my head in Genius's room. The Pony was in denial when I asked, \"Did you hear that?\" I could see it in his eyes. Yes. He heard it. But he has to sleep in the room right across the hall.At first it was just an odd thump here and there. Mostly in the front corner of the room, by his dresser. No creaking of the bed this time. Then, after The Pony had gone up and was using 30 minutes of hot water in the shower, and Hick was in bed already, the ruckus intensified. It did not sound like a full-sized person. None of the heavy stumping across the floor as if no feet were attached, like Hick sounds moving around the main floor. More like a toddler prancing around on a stick-horse. An active toddler training a hickory Lipizzaner Stallion.I know it wasn't the dogs. They had already scrabbled around the side porch to somewhere up the driveway. I heard their frenzied toenails click past, and I could hear their distant barking.The overhead activity continued off and on, with less intensity, for several hours. Around 11:20 p.m., I saw a flash of light in the dark area between the stairs and my office. I always turn off the overhead and watch TV with just a lamp beside me. Surely I imagined it. Probably a reflection of some kind from the TV, light that had come from the television screen, hit the white wall behind the new couch, bounced off, and illuminated that area on the other half of the basement, past the stairs. Yeah. I'm sure that was the explanation, even though it has not happened before. Sometimes I reason like The Pony.I fell asleep in the recliner, and woke up around 3:00 a.m. I always shut down my New Delly desktop overnight. Even if 3:00 a.m. is not considered \"night\" by some people. I made my way through the dark section, and beheld the monitor for Genius's new computer he had built over the holidays. It was on, when it had not been earlier in the evening. Not only was the screen lit up, but it was on his Zune music program playlist, playing music! What's up with that? I didn't HEAR any music, because the speakers were off. But that song was lit up, playing away as shown at the bottom of the screen. The song? \"Pinch Me\" by Barenaked Ladies. I've never heard it. I don't know the lyrics. But it was highlighted and playing silently.That could explain the flash of light, the monitor coming on. But would it stay on for hours? I don't know. When I came out of my office after shutting down, and looked at Genius's monitor, it went off before my very eyes. I suppose he could have been burning the midnight oil, remote-accessing his playlist. I don't know how that crap works. I do know that my internet had shut itself down sometime between 10:00 and 3:00, because I had no access when I tried to check email before my shut-down routine.Only one thing is for certain. Genius did NOT remote-access his room with his feet."}, {"title": "I'll Get By With a Little Help From My Five-Dollar Daughter", "date": "Wednesday, January 8, 2014", "text": "Oh, yeah!

Yeah. What's up with that? Keeping her Five-Dollar Daughter idling on the wrong side of the road while The Pony surefoots his way down other people's footprints in the driveway. It's not like I have the audacity of the ex-mayor, and merrily roll down that gravel slope without a sideward glance. Mom told me to stay out of her driveway, and I stayed out of her driveway, by cracky!I told mom to stay in the house. That The Pony would bring her stuff to the door. I called three times to see if she needed something from the store. No. Made up a little white lie that I was driving The Pony through McDonald's. Could I bring her something from there? A crisp Diet Coke, perhaps? A burger? Well...Mom said that since I was going there anyway, those Diet Cokes were really good (I can't stand them there), and that even though she didn't need any food at the moment, maybe I could pick up three grilled onion cheddar burgers, and she could have one for supper, and freeze two for later. I've got some advice for McDonald's: YOU REALLY NEED TO PLOW YOUR PARKING LOT! Trucks were spinning all over the place in that churned-up snow quicksand. I had sense enough to go out the lower exit by the stoplight, rather than sit at the stop sign on the 45-degree hill, waiting for Walmart drivers to go by.Did Mom stay in the house like a good septuagenarian? What do you think? We called to say we were getting near, and I'll be ding-dang-donged if she didn't walk to the end of the porch, and act like she was going down the steps to the driveway I couldn't enter. The Pony handed her all the stuff. My plan had been for him to take it in, but Mom told him not to come up the steps. She had said earlier on the phone that those darn neighbors who brought her paper to the door Monday, and her mail, because the mail carrier pulled over and handed it to them (!), had left compressed snow icy patches on her porch that she couldn't sweep away. I guess she needs a porch directive like that driveway policy.I did not get out, but hollered down that driveway that I was going to wait right there on the wrong side of the road until Mom got back inside the door. I was quite worried that she might take a spill on that slippery slab of a porch. Did she put her McDonald's bag down inside her Walmart bag and drape it over her arm, holding the Diet Coke in that hand, with one hand left to stabilize herself along the brick house-front? NO! She tottered along holding both bags in one hand and the soda-bottom cupped in her other hand. Did she set the soda down on that one step up into the door? NO! She held that styrofoam soda cup against her body with the two-bag forearm while she pulled out the glass storm door and pushed in the wooden front door.That ol' gal is one tough bird. She sent The Pony back to T-Hoe with a Walmart bag containing an unopened tray of assorted chocolate cookies she had gotten as a gift. When he looked in, braying like a horse-donkey about his good luck at scoring those tasty snacks, The Pony said, \"Hey! There's a five-dollar bill in here, too!\"Of course there was."}, {"title": "Scenes From the Sucking Vortex Also Known as TheVictorian Homestead", "date": "Tuesday, January 7, 2014", "text": "Hey! Have you heard? I have some spare potatoes laying around. Genius asked me to make some potato soup. I'm sure he did that because he had no idea I had 20 pounds of Huge 'Uns in the pantry. I showed him! I really made some potato soup.Okay, so it wasn't as easy as Genius led me to believe. I had to look up a recipe on the internet. I found two. Yes. I admit that they were the first two I looked at. Complicating matters is the fact that Shiba, my laptop set up in the living room in order to run internet via a Sprint connect thingy to my New Delly in my dark basement lair, no longer has printer capabilities. That happened when Genius upgraded the Sprint connect thingy, and put in a new router. It seemed too much trouble to email myself a recipe, then go downstairs and print it. Likewise, it seemed like too much trouble to keep hiking back and forth from the kitchen to the living room while making soup. Oh, and according to Genius, it was also too much trouble to install his downstairs printer to my Shiba, necessitating only a call to The Pony to grab the document and hoof it upstairs to us. As you can see, we are a lazy bunch of slackers who do not really deserve potato soup.I read over those recipes a couple of times. I had most of the ingredients. Well. I had potatoes. I peeled six Huge 'Uns. But first I had to wash them. They smelled like dirt! And left a ring around my sink. Then I had to chop them to Genius's satisfaction, which meant they would disintegrate into pencil-eraser-sized nubs by the time the soup was done. I needed an onion. I asked Genius to hand me one from the bottom crisper of Frig while he was making a giant mess of crumbs around the toaster in a show of making his own lunch of a turkey and pepper jack sandwich. The sigh he emitted could have blown down the first two Little Pigs' houses. Oh, he gave me two onions. The smallest two in the crisper. One recipe called for boiling the diced onion with the potatoes. The other called for sweating the onion in bacon grease. I figured two onions are better than one.There was no celery to be had, so that ingredient was struck from both recipes. One called for ham, the other for bacon. I had a little of each, four half-slices of ham left from Christmas, and a half pound of thick-sliced bacon left from Genius's noontime breakfast yesterday. I tossed in the ham after dicing, and got out the bacon. Wouldn't you know it, both boys wanted a slice. Which turned out to be three for Genius and two for The Pony. Which left me with five slices remaining for the potato soup. I fried up my second tiny onion. Then I added minced garlic, and some concoction of butter, flour, and milk. Some might call it a roux, I think. I followed those directions I had to go back to the living room to find, even though common sense told me to simply pour in some flour, a couple dollops of butter, and a hefty splash of milk.Wouldn't you know it? One recipe required chicken stock. Seriously. My chicken stock has been sitting on the counter, opened, for a month or two. I don't think it goes bad. My work colleague had a fit when her daughter used some and put the waxy cardboard container in the refrigerator. It does not say to refrigerate after opening. I poured some out, and it looked fine. The Pony, in kitchen for his bacon, chanted \"taste it, taste it\" but I demurred. I ransacked the big pantry for any cream-of soup, but alas, I was fresh out. I did, however, find a can of chicken noodle soup that doesn't expire until July 2015, so I used that, meaning to strain out the juice and leave the noodles in the can. Yeah. Guess who made potato soup with noodles? VAL.I'd been grinding in fresh black pepper all along. But for all the garlic and onion and bacon and ham...my potato soup still tasted bland. I shook in some garlic salt, then turned to my old standbys, Worcestershire Sauce, Heinz 57, and, for good measure, some Save A Lot steak sauce. It still tasted a little bland to me, but Hick and Genius scarfed it up like Huge 'Uns were going out of style. They did add a bit of shredded sharp cheddar which I provided without even including any finger skin. On the side, they were all a-twitter about the magnificent biscuits, which came from a box, Red Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuit mix, which is just Bisquick and some garlic powder to mix with butter. I've actually made those biscuits from an internet recipe, and they came out about the same, with the exception of the garlic powder stuff packing more of a punch and having more green-specked color than my melted butter and minced garlic brush-on coating.Yes, I'd call that potato soup a success. Genius even stated later, without prompting, \"That soup was really good.\" Hick hoisted himself up for a second bowl. OF SOUP! And you know how Hick usually likes his soup, TOWERING. But this he ate with a spoon and liked it! It can't be that he was simply starving, since I also gave him sliced Oberle sausage on the side in the guise of protein.Poor, simple Genius. As he was toasting that bread for a sandwich at 11:45, he asked, \"So, I'm not clear. Am I having this potato soup for lunch? Because it says it only takes 15 minutes.\" I explained that his soup would not be ready for lunch. It was supper. He was not accounting for prep time.At 2:00, that potato soup was ready for a slow simmer. Fifteen minutes my--At least there's enough left for tomorrow. And some to give my mom!"}, {"title": "That's How These Tootsies Roll ", "date": "Monday, January 6, 2014", "text": "I'll warn you now. If you don't like feet, look away! Read no further. It's not going to be pretty. You may think you know what's coming, but I doubt any of you possess such a twisted imagination, or jacked-up feet, as Val. You may think you know. But you have no idea.The last time I left the house, which was...uh...the day of the Great Potato Avalanche of '14, if memory serves me correctly, I was on a tight timetable. I was on the phone with my mom, who was hemming and hawing about when and where we should meet so she could get her tasty leftovers to tide her over through the coming blizzard. Never mind that we only meet in one of two regular locations: the Walmart parking lot, or the city park by the out-of-business 7-Eleven. \"Okay, Mom. Let's say 40 minutes from when I hang up the phone. It will take me ten minutes to gather up your stuff and put on my socks and shoes. Ten minutes to get to town. Ten minutes to run in and get potatoes. Ten minutes to drive to Walmart. That's 40 minutes. I've gotta go.\"Mom likes to linger on the phone. Genius makes a flapping mouth motion with his thumb and fingers when he's trying to say goodbye. The Pony speaks monosyllablically, then suddenly says, \"Bye,\" and hangs up. I let her suck me into another story, and before you know it, I could have driven to her house and back in that amount of time.Once I started the self-imposed clock ticking, I grabbed my waiting socks from the back of the couch. Wait. I really needed to clip three toenails. Oh, I have more than three toes. That's not the horror. I have a full complement of ten, in the right distribution. Two market-goers, two home-stayers, two roast-beef-havers, two bereft of roast beef, and two homeward-bound-wee-wee-wee-ers. For some reason, three of those little piggies had grown nails of extraordinary length since the last clipping.Val is not a dainty-footed vixen. Were she a character in The Good Earth, she would be O-lan, not Lotus Flower. Val's feet will never be pampered and pumiced  and massaged and oiled and propped up with crimson crescent nails and cotton-ball puffs dividing the digits. Nor will Val be seen parading her podiatric appendages through the village, all decked out in dainty flip-flops. No. You'd best erase any such images from your still-functioning frontal lobe. Last chance. Look away. It's going to get hideous.Oh, nothing really happens. I didn't slice off a toe or anything. No blood. What do you think I am, a cockatiel? It's just that the description of my feet might be...um...less than appetizing. I don't have long finger-like toes such as The Pony, the ones he uses to pick up a bag of chips off the coffee table. They are stubby, but not so stubby as those of Hick, like vanilla Tootsie Roll Midgies cut in half. If Goldilocks was judging toes solely on length, mine would be almost just right. It's the foot as a whole that is not aesthetically pleasing.Val does not have a silver-plated manicure set. No shiny nail file for her. She is more needful of a rasp. Like one used by a blacksmith, perhaps. And those giant scissoring hoof chompers. If one was to stumble upon Val's footprints in the mud of a coniferous forest in the Pacific Northwest, the only way one could determine whether to notify the media of the latest BigFoot evidence would be the sheer size of the print. The shapes would be disturbingly similar. Glen Campbell as LaBeouf the Texas Ranger would not dehydrate if he had to rely on Val's muddy hoofprints for hydration.Oh, I keep them covered. No need to send observers into the Macaulay Culkin cologne version of The Scream. And they're not so diseased-looking as those of Sid the sewer rat in Flushed Away. I don't have the pinky toe that curls under the other toes and is trod upon all the live-long day. No bunion that juts out like a right-angled Plymouth Rock. I can still fit my dogs into Crocs. And sensible school-marm shoes. Nothing fancy. One day I'm sure to be that old lady with a hole cut in her granny-boot so her big toe can stick out. But until then, I'm just a pedicure-challenged ol' gal with feet whose sole purpose (heh, heh, I'm talking about feet and I said 'sole' purpose, get it?) is to transport her from Point A to Points B, C, and the Walmart parking lot within 40 minutes.I was one minute ahead of the rendezvous time. I attribute my early arrival to the streamlining effect that kicked in after hacking off those three toenails."}, {"title": "Making a Mountain Out of a Potato Hill", "date": "Sunday, January 5, 2014", "text": "A few days ago I found a great deal on a 10-pound bag of baking potatoes at Save A Lot. Huh. I guess maybe that's how they get away with that name. With a Pony who loves baked potatoes, and plans of my impending pot of cabbage/sausage/potato already on the back burner, I snagged a bag.The brand name was Biggins. Not the Al Bundy Big 'Uns. Biggins. Here's a photo of the last one, and the bag.These potatoes were perfect for baking, and for peeling. Great big potatoes mean less elbow grease. Less surface area to be cleared than many small potatoes. We science teachers notice things like that when we're shopping. Actually, it's because we're kind of lazy, all about doing less work. By the time I was done slicing and dicing for my main course to last us a few days, I had only three of those giant bakers left for The Pony's enjoyment. Yesterday I was down to two. With the snow storm rolling in Saturday night, I decided my household might need more Biggins to get us through. You can eat potatoes uncooked if the power goes off, or bake them on the Weber grill. I swear, as my blog readership is my witness, I'll never chomp on a limp carrot like Scarlett O'Hara. Frankly, my dear, I think Katie Scarlett would have given up Ashley Wilkes for a Biggin. I headed off to town to foist leftovers on my mom, and to pick up some more of those fantastic potatoes. I knew just what to look for. I whipped into the only parking spot available at the Save A Lot/Dollar Store/Subway/Coin Laundry mini-mall. I was on a tight time schedule to meet my mom in the next town at Walmart, she who refused to wait home like a sensible woman, for her Five-Dollar Daughter to deliver her scraps. I commandeered a cart and headed past the impulse purchase shelf of leftover Christmas candies, past the risers of bananas, to the special potato risers. Right where I found my Biggins a few days ago.What was this? Just as I went to unbag my Biggins with my eyes in order to get the best assortment...I noticed that there were no Biggins. These were Huge 'Uns. IN 20-POUND BAGS! I had no need for 20 pounds of potatoes. But they were only five dollars for that bag of huge baking potatoes. I went on down to the regular potato corner. Oh, there were smaller bags. But they were smaller potatoes. I wanted the big bakers. So I backed up my cart and started perusing the offerings. I felt those Huge 'Uns to see if they were firm. Peeped through the thin plastic. I started to lift a satisfactory bag to my cart. Do you have any idea how heavy 20 pounds of potatoes are? THEY WEIGH 20 POUNDS!I kind of dragged that bag over to the child-seat part of my cart. It was almost in when it happened. The Great Potato Avalanche of\u00a0 '14. Have you ever tried to stop a mountain of potatoes from obeying the law of gravity? I know there were more than ten bags on the left, and more than ten bags on the right. Both columns of 20-pound bags started to slide toward me. And the floor. That's over 400 pounds of potatoes! Do you know how many hands it takes to put a 20-pound bag of potatoes in your cart, then stop over twenty 20-pound bags of Huge 'Uns from sliding off a slanted wooden produce rack? Let me just tell you...MORE THAN TWO!But I didn't have more than two arms. A roving gang of flannel-shirted mountain men had convened a morning meeting over by the onion/lettuce alcove. They did not seem to notice my distress. One was entertaining the others with his plans for the day. \"I'm a-gonna toss some wood into the back of the truck for weight.\" He looked around for a box of vegetables to use as a spittoon for his juicy chaw. Yet still they ignored my predicament. Chivalry is indeed dead. As Progressive Flo would say, \"These are troubling times in the kingdom.\"I flipped my own 20-pound Huge 'Uns end over end into the cart, like an unwieldy, lumpy Slinky. I tried to flop the first slider over onto a couple of red plastic crates of onions. No. When one end stopped, the other kept going, then pulled the first end back onto the slope. I tried that three times. I'm a slow learner. In the meantime, on the right-hand column, I kept pushing back the bottom bag when it was near the edge. That did not slow any bags behind it. Finally, I could shove it back no more. I propped the leading end on some packages of peanuts in the shell. It worked! That bottom bag balance precariously, thanks to the peanut shells which absorbed their weight. I'm sure somebody's gonna buy peanuts in the shell, and think, \"Hey, that's great! These are already cracked.\"After huffing and puffing for nigh on five minutes, grabbing that left-hand bottom bag and lifting it halfway up the column, I got it wedged just right. I was exhausted. I pushed my cart quickly around a display of bottled water and headed lickety-split to the checkout. I did NOT want to be around when gravity declared victory. Of course one of my former students was working the register. \"Hi. How was your break? Did you find everything you need?\"\"Yes. Great. I just stopped in for a few potatoes.\"I had to push that Huge 'Uns behemoth out to T-Hoe in a cart, and flop the bag over the bumper into T-Hoe's rear. When I got to Walmart just as Mom was arriving, I told her out the window, \"I've got a special surprise for you!\" She climbed in to talk a few minutes. Not only was she overjoyed to get her cabbage/sausage/potato delight, and fried rice, and sweet-and-sour sauce, and a third-of-a-head of cabbage, and a giant baking potato, and three-and-a-half corn muffins...she delighted in my offer to fill a bag with potatoes from the back of T-Hoe. She even found a special treat, a heart-shaped potato.\"Just a symbol of my love for you, Mom.\"She nodded. And left without giving me any money. But she did declare, before she drove out of sight, \"Thank you for sharing that potato story with me. I'll be laughing out loud all the way home. People will think I'm crazy.\"I guess the apple really doesn't fall far from the tree."}, {"title": "No, I am NOT Trying to Get My Inheritance Quicker Than Five Dollars at a Time", "date": "Saturday, January 4, 2014", "text": "Snow's a-comin'!That means I had to get out and provide my mom with some tasty leftovers. She might be a shut-in for a week or more. That's how she doesn't roll. Besides, she's almost done with the leftovers I gave her Tuesday for Wednesday's snow storm. Uh huh. That was some tasty whole-wheat spaghetti, garlic toast, and beans-and-ham-and-black-eyed-peas. Let the record show that the garlic toast was fresh right out of Save A Lot's freezer case. What do you think I am, some kind of two-dollar daughter who gives her mom garbage?Mom insisted on meeting me on the upper end of Walmart's parking lot. By the Pizza Hut. I was perfectly willing to drive all the way to her house. But she was going to charge up her Blazer's battery a bit with a drive, before backing it into the garage to wait out the deep freeze. Let the record also show that the backing in was my idea. Seriously. She always worries about backing up her icy driveway, over the hump of snow left by the snow plow. Don't you think simply opening up the garage door and driving forward would be easier? Me too. AND I told her to put that Blazer in 4WD so it would be ready. You don't even want to know what can of worms that opened. But I'm going to tell you anyway.Mom likes to \"save\" her 4WD. Like it will wear out. Like she only has so many hours minutes of 4WD before it goes kaput. I know. The elderly are a curious lot. Also, Mom said she has to come to a complete stop and put her PRNDL in neutral to change over to 4WD. I know her vehicle is older than my T-Hoe. But I am supposed to have it moving when I switch over. Unless it's to 4WD Low. Seems that's what Mom was getting at. I only meant she should have her Blazer in its 4WD capability. I have something called 4WD Automatic. That's what Hick calls it, anyway. That means in that setting, if the wheels start to slip, 4WD kicks in. Then I have the regular 4WD setting. Then the 4WD Low for when I really mean business.Dear me. Mom had me SO confused. \"Oh, I have to come to a complete stop and be in neutral to put my car in four-wheel-drive. Tom out at Tom Dick and Harry's Tire Shop told me. They're so good to me. Tom told me just how to use it. What? Well, I guess your car is different. Tom told me to stop. Now, he DID say that it's okay to be moving when I switch it to that next one up. I guess it must be three-wheel-drive. And I can have it moving for the next one, the four-wheel-drive. But for that four low, I have to be stopped. And in neutral. So I decided I would back my car in the garage. I left it in two-wheel-drive. I know that when I'm ready to pull out of the garage, I can put it in four low then. Because I'm already stopped.\"Pardon my face-palm. Three-wheel-drive indeed! But whatever makes Mom feel secure. I do admit that if she had tried backing with that beast in 4WD Low, she would have had difficulty steering. Which we really don't want. Because it seems my scathingly brilliant idea to prepare Mom for her eventual getaway after this new bout of global cooling could have led to her demise. I'm beside myself. Here's the rest of the story.\"Oh, I was hoping you would call me. No, I'm not eating. I'm watching the Mizzou basketball game. But my food is ready. It's in the...uh...thing where I make my food...oh...I'm drawing a blank. You know! Where I get my food ready...the...um...\"\"You mean your stove, Mom?\"\"No. Not the stove. The other thing. In the wall...\"\"Oh, your oven.\"\"No. Not the oven. Above it.\"\"The MICROWAVE!\"\"Yes! That's it. It's all ready for me to turn it on. I'm going to wait until around 6:30. I was all ready to have some of that cabbage and sausage you brought me, but I think I'll save that until tomorrow, because I wanted the rice and sweet-and-sour sauce. I had some of those grilled chicken strips in the freezer that will go with it. Mmm...that's going to be good.\"\"So, you wanted me to call?\"\"Oh, yes! I wanted to tell you how good I did at backing into the garage. I lined up the car, and got out to make sure nothing was in the way. Then I got back in and backed down the driveway. I got it in the garage, and then I got out to check if I was okay. My tailpipe was up against a plastic bag. So I thought, 'That's probably not good.' I got back in the car and pulled forward about two feet, and that seemed like it would be fine.\"\"I didn't know you had stuff in your garage. Did it melt the bag?\"\"No! The exhaust pipe was just laying barely on the top of it. It wasn't THAT hot. I checked. I put my hand around the tailpipe, and it was barely warm.\"\"You grabbed the tailpipe after you'd been driving? You could have burned your hand!\"\"Oh, come on. Give me some credit. I DO have a little bit of sense. I didn't wrap my whole hand around it. Just felt of it. I could tell it wasn't that hot.\" \"Mom, you know that when you started up the car again, it shot hot exhaust into that bag. Did you check again to see if it melted?\"\"Oh, it wasn't that hot. I've been looking out my living room window to see if there's any light in the garage, and it's dark. That was a long time ago. When did I get home...around 2:30. There's not going to be a fire.\"\"What's in the bag?\"\"Well, I think it's a trash bag full of straw.\"\"WHAT? I hope nothing is smoldering in there.\"\"Stop that. Don't be silly. I might not even have been straw. It might have been a bag of old clothes.\"\"You know, people on those survival shows would love to be stranded in your garage. So many firestarters.\"\"Everything is fine. I've been checking on it.\"\"I never would have told you to back in if I knew you had that stuff laying around. I thought you only kept aluminum cans out there.\"\"It's going to be fine.\"Yes. I'm sure it will. I certainly hope so. A bag of STRAW? Seriously. What is she, the first little pig? I know a kid whose whole house burned down in the middle of the night because her mom dumped an ashtray in the wastebasket that afternoon, then took out the trash, and it smoldered into flames in the early morning hours.Mom will be fine.

Kind of slippery, but nothing to keep a Tahoe from driving to town for a 44 oz. Diet Coke from the 80-cent store. The Pony and I headed out around noon, and returned before 1:00. We did not notice anything amiss. The main road was clear, but our gravel and county roads were covered.Hick arrived home a bit earlier than usual, due to a doctor's appointment. He immediately began quizzing everyone as to their whereabouts all day. \"Did you go over to the BARn field?\" No. No, no, no, and no. He asked Genius, who went to get the mail around 2:00, and The Pony, who doesn't even drive his truck in fair weather. Plus his oldest son, and The Veteran. Negatory on all counts.\"I saw that a truck had been down in the BARn field. It parked by the burn pile where Oldest and The Veteran always park when they come out. There were footprints over toward the trailer. They stopped before getting to the trailer. The truck came in through the field, and left through the field. It went back towards town. Never went past the house.\"\"Huh. The dogs were going crazy at that end of the house. Maybe they scared him away. They go crazy all the time. Over nothing. You might want to take a wheel off that trailer. Or chain it up. They've been stealing them and selling them for scrap, you know.\"It might be time to put the game camera on the front of the BARn again. This would-be thief is not the sharpest blade on the Swiss Army Knife. Who goes out to steal something the day after a snow that will show his tire and shoe treads? With the plethora of programs handing out free stuff to people in need, I can't imagine this trailer-stealing ring is resorting to this tactic to feed their families. The church donation box thief whose picture was published in the paper a couple of months ago didn't look like he'd missed any meals. I'd let the dude hitch up the trailer, throw in a few goats, and show him the way out. But not everybody out here is like that. One of these ne'er-do-wells is going to mess with the wrong person's stuff, and get a backside full of lead. Which is still better than ending up in a septic tank, marinating for over a year.Whether Hick takes my advice remains to be seen. The tracks weren't there at 1:00, and Hick was home by 4:30. Genius was in and out around 2:00. Who knows. On Tuesday morning, a car stopped on the gravel road in front of the house. Just sat there. I went to the front door and stuck my head out. Funny. They drove off then. I don't know what the deal is. Hick says that car belongs up past us. You can never be too sure what's going on around here, after that body was found in the septic tank last fall. I guess we'll just sit here and wait to be robbed blind.

Diet Coke.Hick tried to monkey-wrench my plans by demanding that The Pony help him take down the Christmas decorations in the yard. It's not like we live in a show home, or even on a well-traveled thoroughfare. I doubt that the folks who have to dodge Hick's goats on the gravel road care if Santa stands sentry until the weekend. The Pony, on the other hand, is like a wooly sheep. I could count him jumping off the new couch as a sleep aid. Every morning, he must run wet fingers through his mop to control the Einstein tendencies.I put the pot of beans on to boil then simmer. My mom had given me the ham remnants from Christmas, along with a tasty bone for Juno. I chopped the ham and tossed it in with the Great Northerns, and added two cans of blackeyed peas. They're a tradition on the New Year, you know. For good luck. I wrote out some bill payments, called Mom, watched the weather and several episodes of House Hunters along with the Property Brothers hosting the Rose Parade, then whistled for The Pony. I grabbed last night's leftover spaghetti, dipped out some beans and peas and ham, and we left. My mom knows snow is coming. She will feel better with some of my leftovers in her fridge. I stopped for milk and picked up some garlic toast to go with Mom's spaghetti.Did you know that Terrible Cuts is closed on New Year's Day? Yeah. What's up with that? How dare those shearers not work on one of my ten days off? What's the world coming to? The Pony did not seem to mind. He saw it as a reprieve of sorts. We dropped off Mom's eats, and headed for the bank. Then it was off to get my 44 oz. Diet Coke.THE PRICE WENT UP 30 CENTS!It's a sure sign of the apocalypse. A refill for $1.37?

So...shed of my crackly faulty unused mattress pad, I turned that cart on two wheels and headed back to the bedding section. That's what everybody does, right, after buying three different crackly faulty mattress pads? Goes directly to that aisle and buys another one?That $20.53 was virtually burning a hole in my pocket. Must. Buy. Another. Mattress. Pad. I parked my walker/cart beside the shelves. The mattress pads were on a long aisle going across the store. To catch your attention, I suppose. They morphed into quilts and fleece blankets and thirsty towels. The humdrum sheets and comforters and pillow cases ran down shorter aisles, from front to back. Yes. These mattress pads were the bait. The carrot in that wooden box propped up by a stick.I found Quiet Comfort, which I believe is the Walmart brand, as it was the cheapest and the first three choices of Hick. Then there was Simmons Beautyrest. But I chose the third option. The mid-price just-right Goldilocks version, Serta. Sure, it was two-and-a-half times the price of my refund. But sometimes, you actually get what you pay for. It's still hermetically sealed in its airtight zippered clear-plastic cube. Unlike a certain date of Elaine Benes, we're afraid to take it out. I really hope nobody bought this one and took it home to see if it would fit on their bed, then shoved it back in the plastic and returned it! That would just be wrong. But that's not the story!As I stood plopping one mattress pad pod after the other onto the child seat area of my cart/walker, unzipping them and fingering the fill and the stretchy fitted part...a \"janitor\" swept by me. Yes. A little dude with a short push broom. I think he was wearing a flannel shirt, and he might have also had on a blue Walmart vest. I would be a terrible crime witness. I did perceive him as shorter than me, and because of that, I could see that his sandy man-mullet was thinning on top. He came right up behind me, from the main front-to-back aisle that separates the hardware section from housewares. Yes. I had come that way myself, from the pharmacy where I picked up toothpaste and face soap for Genius. This guy could have been a bloodhound on my trail. Or McGruff sans raincoat.Sweeper came right up to my heels, then veered off at a right angle down the king/queen sheet sets. I had made my decision by now, and hmpfed at his audacity to get right up on me before turning. I can get that on the backroads of Backroads anyday. Off I went, straight down my aisle, to the center of the store. I zigged a couple aisles toward the back, then zagged back across to Men's Wear. Pony needs a new pair of pants. He doesn't so much need them as wants them, in an unspoken manner, pants with a watch pocket to encase his new pocket watches. The Pony is not a fan of jeans, preferring cargo pants with loose legs and large pockets. But he'll make an exception for his precious Christmas watches.There I was, perusing straight legs, boot cuts, and carpenters for acceptable Ponywear. I'll be ding dang donged if Sweeper didn't appear out of thin air and cut down the Dickies aisle behind my jeans table! What a coincidence that was! Almost as if he had followed my exact path. In no way did he have time to sweep up and down all those aisles in between.I tossed a pair of carpenters into the cart, and headed on across the store to find Little Debbie. Genius is home, and there's a shortage. I had to veer two aisles up toward the front of the store. Little Debbie dwells across from the first freezer case. I imagine her people are also frozen pizza people. Wouldn't you know it, I had left my glasses at home. After that whole month of being without them, they're a second thought. I bent down to grab a box of Cosmics. Drat! It was a regular box. Not the large economy size. A regular box would not last two days around this Genius-ridden abode.I put it back, and moved my walker/cart a few feet along, still squinting. A rough-looking lady was standing back, most likely having the opposite vision issue as mine, needing to press her back up against the glass freezer doors in order to see. \"Are you looking for the big box? Because I saw you put back the regular one. And right down there on the very end, beside it, is the big box.\" She bent over and snagged it for me. A regular person-helping person.\"Thank you so much! That's just what I was looking for. I don't have my glasses.\" I put Little Debbie in my cart/walker, and was just about to wheel around and head to the deli for a big Ranch Cobb Salad, when I slammed on my walker/cart brakes.SWEEPER WAS RIGHT THERE, GOING ACROSS THE AISLE BETWEEN ME AND THE FREEZER!That, my friends, is no coincidence. I was being mattress-pad profiled! Seriously. Are the surveillance cameras not good enough? Does security doubt that any employee (and I'm including Granny and Grampy Greeter) would be able to catch me totin' my purloined mattress pad out of the store? Have you ever seen a Walmart janitor? Not me. Not unless they call for a cleanup on a specific aisle. Really? A janitor taking the exact same path through the ten-acre store as Val, at 11:30 on a Monday morning? I don't think so.I really think Sweeper could have better spent his time following the Grandpa/Grandson Played-Gamers, or the Fairy Barbie Frauds.Let me steal a bit from Uncle Kracker:I don't know how you found meI don't know whyI really wish you'd turn around and say goodbyeAll I know is when you're with meI just ain't freeWho told you to push that broom and follow me?Follow me?

So it's only fitting that he assigned about-town chores to Genius and me today, since he has gone back to work and can't follow through.Genius drew the License Office short straw. Heh, heh. You can be sure there was no actual straw-drawing involved. No way would I take a chance on going back to that den of incompetent photo-takers. I suppose Hick saw that job as more manly than returning the unfittable moisture-barrier mattress pad. That was my delightful duty. Uh huh. On the Monday after Christmas, when folks flock to Walmart to return \"gifts\" they have tired of, or have worn out, or just want to trade in their old belongings for new items.In the past, I have had issues with Walmart Customer Disservice. No matter whether I had my receipt and pristine purchase, others around me would be serviced while I was put through the task of jumping through hoops. Seriously. What am I, a person who makes a living returning stolen goods? Standing in line at the Walmart Customer Disservice Center is not worth it. Better to suck out septic tanks with a crazy straw than go through that maze every day with unminded kids flinging items out of the return cart and bearded mountain men banging on the CoinStar machine.So off I headed to complete my task. Begrudgingly. I had my receipt. My bag of moisture-barrier bed cover. My driver's license. A story that would hold up in court. I snagged a cart in the parking lot to use as a walker. Plopped my faulty purchase in the child-seat part of the cart. Headed in the EXIT door. That drives The Pony crazy, but he wasn't with me today. Besides, everybody does it at the Backroads Walmart. AND they go out the ENTRANCE. That's because the doors are wonky. I pushed my bone-rattling walker across those rough entrance tiles. Looked for the greeter to put a sticker on my mattress cover. But there was no greeter. That's a bad omen. The last time I returned something without a greeter, I was detained longer than normal while my interrogators espoused that there was ALWAYS a greeter, and I should have a sticker, because how else do they know I didn't just bring in my receipt from the previous day, and hike through the store to grab an item, and come back up front to get a Walmart card for the amount of the item? Huh. I don't know. Maybe review the last five minutes of all that surveillance footage from the 50 cameras?This time, I was 9th in line. Dang that Hick and his ignorant bedding-buying ways! A people-watcher would have had a heyday in this queue. Unfortunately, the lady behind me had brought a couple of her little people-watchers. I'm not a kid-hater, but if you're not my kid, and you're not my student, I don't really want to have anything to do with you, unless you're an infant with fat little bare feet, which are, like, the best part of a baby, and quite aesthetically pleasing. This little people-watcher made a point of walking all the way up beside my cart and turning to stare into my face. Go away, pest. I'm not talking to you. Go mind your business. I'm not a clown handing out balloon animals. You've got to be at least eight years old. Get some manners. You'd have thought I was that old woman Elaine Benes volunteered to visit, complete with a football-sized goiter jutting out of my neck. Get your peepers off of me, you little creeper.As I waited. And waited. I noticed an alarming trend. The Customer Disservice clerks were actually servicing people. ALL people. No matter what they plopped on the counter. An old man and 6ish-year-old boy had a game in a green case. I don't know my games, but I'm guessing Xbox or an equivalent. There was clearly no wrapping on the case. The clerk looked all around it. Popped it open. Turned to her colleague and asked what she should do. Colleague nodded. \"Refund it.\" Are you freakin' kidding me? As if that was not an obvious enough case of a kid taking back a game he already played, the kid shouted, \"YEAH!\" and pumped his fist. Grampy tried to calm him down with a glance and a hand on his shoulder.THEN the lady in front of me stepped up with her little girl of around 5, and set a Fairy Barbie kind of toy on the counter. I'm not sure, because I'm not a Barbie collector or a girl-toy aficionado. But it was a slim standing doll in a green flowery base kind of toy. No box. No wrapping. Like it was right out of the toy box. No questions asked. Just two statements. \"My daughter got this for Christmas, and she has one.\" \"Okay. We'll need you to go get one in a box so I can scan the price.\"Seriously? That guy from the convenience store in Florida who caught an alligator in the park and tried to trade it for beer should have driven up here to Backroads. He could use his Walmart cash refund to buy his beer.You might be thinking I was given a hard time with my cash-paid receipt and crackly mattress pad. Nope. That clerk took the receipt, forked over my cash, didn't even ask to see my driver's license (you know how disappointed I was not to have a chance to show off that picture), and told me to have a nice day.You might think that's too simple an ending for Val. It is.

So, Val, this is just to sayWe have read themthe wordsright here onyour blog pagewords whichyou painstakinglycomposedfor our laughsforgive usthey're hilariousso neatand so bold.\"Yes, I appreciate the sentiment. I am still able to type. My arm did, indeed, clank to the cold tile floor. The left arm of my best-Christmas-gift-ever red-cushioned five-wheeled adjustable office chair. Chairy had a hard life. Gave me her best years. But now has grown decrepit. As much time as I spend with my buttocks pressed to her seat, I'd say she's about 187 in chair years. Oh, Chairy's metal skeleton still remains. It was only a plastic-flesh wound. But now I'm unbalanced. Hush. It's not polite to murmur amongst yourselves, \"Now?\" Oh, the poor timing. If only I had lost an arm before Christmas, I'm sure Hick would have gotten me a new office chair. Or not. He seems to have gone all out with the scratch-off tickets, jelly sticks, and The Heat.The baby disappeared. As I combed my tresses in the bathroom this morning, yes, using a mirror, and yes, with the light on, and yes, using a pick...I saw that we were down one baby. I save babies, you know. Not grotesque plastic dolls with elephantiasis that grow mold on their good leg. Nope. I saved three babies. The ones trapped in ice cubes at my niece's baby shower. My winning baby I keep separate. But the ones that had been clutched in The Pony's hands and jammed in Hick's armpit I set on the bathroom counter. I've been meaning to move them, but they look so cheerful there by Hick's charging phone, and the gray hair pick, and the red round-bristled brush. Yesterday, I noticed that there was only one baby. Not two. I'm afraid to ask. No good can come of this. It's not like the Baby Jesus with a GPS attached at the Baby Jesus Factory. And, unlike a stolen Baby Jesus in the news several years ago, I don't think my ice baby is making the rounds of bars in Belleville, having drinks bought for him.My son is on his way to the moon. Figuratively, I hope. Genius is off to a nerd rendezvous, where two teams of four engineery-type dudes will compete to see who can land a rocket on the moon first in Godus, some kind of computery game that's still in beta. Godus speed, Genius. May the laws of physics be ever in your favor.Our bed is too obese for protection. Hick thought he'd be a dear and change the sheets a while back, when he had a day off, just before my seven show days. Like giving a mouse a cookie, his decision had repercussions. Hick decided to put on a set of flannel sheets. Because sleeping with a quilt over his breathered head doesn't keep him warm enough, I suppose. After he got the current sheets off, and went to remove the mattress pad, he decided to purchase a new one. Seems his toenails are like that of a raptor, and had shredded his side of the quilted cotton mattress pad. Because he's Hick, and hides his light and bedmaking shenanigans under a bushel, I did not know of his surprise mattress pad. Until I went to bed that night.As I lay me down to sleep, no shredded cotton at Hick's feet, I heard a crunching noise. As if Hick had been eating Chex Mix in bed, and missed his mouth because it was covered by his breather. What in the name of all that is Hickly had he done? Because I needed my beauty rest, I crunched down under the flannel for a snooze. I won't go into detail here, because this is a story I might want to elaborate upon for a submission somewhere. Let it suffice to say that the new mattress pad was crunchy and slippery and sweat-inducing. It seems Hick had picked up one that had a moisture barrier. Which...um...we really have no need for. But it was $19.97, so Hick snatched it up like a box of MEAT at a Thursday night auction.Hick went back to the store today. Weeks of trying to adjust to that mattress pad have proven it unsleepable. I had looked for a plain cotton one, to no avail. I even unzipped the plastic bag packaging to make sure. Because they're not always labeled correctly. Hick brought one home today that he said was different. It was identical to the bad pad. He returned it and endured a grilling, then brought home a different one (he said) that cost four dollars more. He and The Pony, even with my help, could not fit that thing on our bed. Hick did not consider the fact that we have a pillow-topper mattress. It is thick. The fitted corners of the mattress pad will not tuck under the edge. I'm off tomorrow to pretend my husband bought the wrong size, and see if I can return it and buy a king size instead of a queen. It wasn't slept on or anything. Not even fitted on our mattress. Not that we didn't try. Hick already threw his first purchase away, and I say good riddance to crunchy rubbish. How hard can it be to find a quilted cotton mattress pad without a moisture barrier that fits a pillow-topper mattress? I'll find out tomorrow. Genius will have to return the next one.If he's back from the moon, that is."}, {"title": "A Tale of Two Pretties", "date": "Saturday, December 28, 2013", "text": "There it is. The new bargain couch. In all its breathtaking glory. I don't know why the photo did not show the true color. Maybe The Pony should get the next phone upgrade in March.Sofie is actually the color of an Army-issue duffel bag slung over the shoulder of Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce. Notice the spore pillows. Quite kitschy, I think. Of course, there's no explanation for the orb. I'm not even sure The Pony noticed it in his photo. Don't want to scare him away from his new daytime resting place. I don't think the orb came with Sofie. More likely a holdover from that second-hand dresser on the other side of the room. It seems to have been a catalyst for other happenings. While some would declare it to be a speck of dust in my ill-kempt house, I find it convenient that such dust does not appear in all snapshots.Now I am a bit disturbed. I didn't notice that orb until I put this photo on the blog. Oh, well. Here's an orb of a different color. Okay. It's almost the same color, from the green family. The Pony says this is his favorite Christmas gift.No dragon was harmed in the harvesting of this eye. It's actually an iris under a magnifying dome on the lid of a metal treasure-holding bowl/ball/orb/sphere thingy. I saw it on a website and knew this eye was earmarked for The Pony. In fact, upon surveying his take Christmas morning, The Pony's attention settled upon this acquisition. \"Yeah. I think I won THAT contest.\" Meaning the unspoken competition between him and his nerd friends over who got the coolest gift. The eye is the size of a softball. He couldn't get a good picture without the glare. I think he was holding the peeper at arm's length to take the photo, because that's the floor and Hick's chainsaw sharpener and a book and a dagger sheath in the background.

You know what that means. I took my mom on a ride for my bill-paying purposes. As usual, she had an excellent adventure. No, we did not stop by Arby's. Too many holiday leftovers in Frig. In fact, we kind of rushed through the bill-paying part, except at my credit union, where I was depositing money so that one day, perhaps, The Pony can soak up some higher education. I was momentarily delayed by the clerk asking me through the glass window with the scoop in the counter for money-passing if I knew any business teachers who had seniors looking for a part-time position. Yeah, I have connections. I will pass on that opportunity to somebody in-the-know.The reason for our rushing was that we were meeting up with Hick for some furniture shopping. We have been needing a new couch for the basement. According to Hick, The Pony has ruined the couch by laying on it playing computer games. Never mind that Hick bought this couch before The Pony was even a gleam in his eye. Before Genius was even a gleam in his eye. Before he even met me and commandeered three of the four pork chops I cooked for supper one night. Yep. A 26-year-old couch, ruined in the last two years by a 15-year-old.Mom is in the market for a new recliner. She is kind of persnickety about her cushiony comfort. One year we bought her a chair, and she used it until it wore out. But she has Diet Coke wishes and coleslaw dreams. Nothing fancy. She wants a chair to fit her like a glove, and have just the right hip-to-ankle measurement in the footrest. Because I know Mom is unlikely to venture out on her own with furniture-buying in mind, I asked her to join us.Funny thing. If I wasn't actively in the market for a piece of furniture, but only accompanying someone else, I would most definitely plop myself down near the entrance so they couldn't escape without me, and rest my weary bones and adipose tissue upon some comfy new sofa or wing-back chair. Not so with Mom. She followed us all through the couches, stopping to sit on a few, bounce around, lean back, and declare them firm or soft. She was like a puppy gamboling through a field of butterflies. Her recliners were in another section of the store. I offered to drive her down to that entrance when we were done with couches, but she declined.Hick and I only saw two couches that appealed to us in the first store. Our requirements were: dark color, firm, no pillowy backs, and reasonable price. We found one for $899 and another for $999. Not that Hick would have paid that. He's a barterer. He's like a car salesman playing the what-if game, but from the other side. Instead of, \"What if I can get you in this car today? What if I can get you a set of floor mats? What if I can get a free undercoating? Will you buy this car today?\" Hick bandies words concerning delivery vs. pickup, jettisoning the three pillows that we don't really need, observed scratches or loose threads, and the kicker: CASH money.Nothing really grabbed us, including the salesman. I do appreciate his lack of effort. I do not want to be followed around the store (except by my mom the frisky puppy), or led to items attached to sales bonuses or quick turnover. We left and headed to a smaller store run by the relative of a work colleague. Mom especially wanted to go there, because they carry Ashley furniture. Which might as well be Greek to me, as I am one for going-out-of-business establishments, and second-hand shops.Huh. The minute we walked in the door, a spry little gal behind the counter called to us and pointed out the couch and recliner areas. Mom parted ways with us, and went to sit a spell in every chair in the place. We meandered around to the back wall, observing plenty of pretty couches to the tune of $1199 and up. Then we saw one. Basic. Four legs, three cushions, two arms. Just the ticket. And the ticket itself was $599. Perfect. Except for the color, a yellow-cream hue, which I knew would not cotton to The Pony's ways.And there she was! Spry had snuck up on us like Katniss on a meaty mammal. \"Do you like this one? I can get it ready. You can take it today. Is this what you're looking for?\"\"Well, it is. We just need something for a 15-year-old boy to lay on all day and play computer games. But I'm afraid that color will not do.\"\"Oh! How do you feel about olive green? We have the same couch up here, in olive green. And we're trying to move that couch. It's a real bargain. Come take a look at it. Sit on it. I think you'll like it.\"We went toward the front. There it was. And the tag said $299. Hick immediately said, \"I like it.\" I said, \"I can live with it.\" We each sat down. It was firm. Sturdy. Three cushions long. Had all its feet.Spry said, \"Let's go write up the ticket.\" No wallflower, she. We told her we wanted it, but that we were going to see now Mom was doing. She was only one row over. Sitting in a recliner. It was a gray-green color. She liked it. She really liked it. She said she might come back and get it next week. Spry was on her like pigs on loaves of Peta's burned bread. Like Haymitch on a cocktail. Like President Snow on an uprising. \"Do you want me to take the ticket off of it? So nobody else buys it? Do you want to put down some money today so we save it?\"Mom dug in her heels. \"I am not ready to do anything today. But I really like it. I want this chair. Just not today.\"Spry was not done trying. \"All three of those there are the exact same chair. So even if somebody buys this one, there are the other two. And we have some in boxes in the storeroom. It should be okay. We'll have one like that. It's an Ashley, you know.\" As if the deal was not already clinched, that cemented it more solidly than Jimmy Hoffa in the NY Giants' end zone.Mom was adamant. \"I want this one. I sat in the other two, and they don't feel the same. This one fits me just right.\" A regular Goldilocks, our playful little puppy.Spry talked her into a deposit. It was no big deal, because Mom really wanted that chair. She just wanted it in her own good time. She does not respond well to pressure. However, since she was only putting down a deposit, and controlling the delivery date, she was appeased. So worried was Spry that she blurted, as she ripped off the $319 tag, \"I can let you have it for $300!\"Yeah, baby! Cheap furniture! We here in Backroads are all about functionality. It's not like we can drop in and visit Brook and Amy Dubman at Carol House. Sure, we like nice things. But we like cheap things better.I don't have a picture this evening, but our new basement Pony-holder is kind of the color and texture of a Korean War U.S. Army-issue duffel bag. With cream-colored piping around the cushions and arms. And two big square pillows of light color with a print of circular spores in the same olive green.Take my word for it: our new couch is breathtaking."}, {"title": "Old Folks and Technology, a Curious Combination", "date": "Thursday, December 26, 2013", "text": "MOM ALERT!My mom received a new remote control for Christmas yesterday. It goes with her cable TV system. I don't know if anything was wrong with her other remote. It could have just been a case of it needing new batteries. My best old ex-teaching buddy Mabel could relate to that. There's something about Moms and remotes and batteries. Mabel used to be a regular battery mule for her mom.Anyhoo...Mom had been using two different remotes. One for volume, and the other for on/off and channel surfing. She has done this ever since she got cable, and even since she got a new TV. I think it's just a personal peccadillo. Apparently, my sister the ex-mayor's wife does not think Mom should be using two remotes. She took it upon herself to go by the cable TV office and get a new one for Mom. The clerk gave her a hard time. \"Usually, people bring in the old remote when they need a new remote.\"Sis: \"I am giving it as a gift. I can hardly break into her house and steal the old remote and bring it in. Then my mom would only have one remote until she unwrapped the new one at Christmas.\"Clerk: \"Well, if you're not going to bring in the old remote, you'll have to pay a fee. The remote itself is free for cable subscribers, but we have to have the old one back. Otherwise everyone would come by for extra remotes.\"Sis: \"I will pay the fee. I was going to buy the remote anyway. I couldn't find one like it anywhere else.\"Clerk: \"The fee for a new remote is three dollars. Of course we will refund that when you bring in the old remote.\"Sis: \"That's all? Here's three dollars. That's not very much. I'll bring in the old one anyway. I don't have any use for it.\"So Mom got a new remote. Not that she knew how to do anything with it. Genius had to go help Mom fix it because my nephew put it on full screen, and Mom prefers to watch her shows with five inches of black all around the picture. That's how she describes it. But when she watches Mizzou play basketball, she wants the full screen, so she changes it. According to her, she used to change it by pushing two blue buttons at the top of the remote, but this one didn't have two blue buttons.Today The Pony and I dropped by Mom's house for a leftover lunch. The Pony downloaded some computer games in the family room while Mom and I visited in the kitchen. \"Oh! Pony! My remote control would not turn off the TV last night. Do you know how it works? I think something is wrong with it. The channel buttons work, but not the OFF button. I was going to try that other remote I use for volume, but I didn't want to mess it up.\"\"You mean your TV has been on since yesterday afternoon?\"\"Well...yes. I need to know how to turn it off.\"\"I can imagine you worrying over that TV. You won't leave the house with it on. So now you're housebound, all because of that new remote that cost Sis three dollars.\"\"You're right. I don't want to go off and leave it on. But I admit that a couple of times before, with the old remote, when I was just running down the hill for gas, or to mail a letter, I left it on. Then I thought, 'If somebody comes in here, they will think, that crazy lady left her TV on while she's not even here.'\"\"Um...that would be a thief in your house while you were gone. Why would you care what a thief thinks about your electricity usage?\"\"Oh, I don't know. I just don't want anybody to think I'm weird.\"\"Yeah. That would never happen.\"For the record, The Pony turned off the TV with no problem. \"It works for me. Maybe you should come try it now.\"According to Mom, \"He didn't use that white button on the top left that I used to use on my old remote. There's a red button on the right that says POWER. That's the one he used. Now I'll know.\"Sometimes, I'm not sure what Mom is thinking."}, {"title": "It Is Truly Better to Give Than to Receive", "date": "Wednesday, December 25, 2013", "text": "We have a revolving gift that will scare the pants offa ya! It all started with my sister's husband the ex-mayor's sister-in-law. Okay. Technically, it started with me. But not really.A few years ago I gave my niece a book called Creepy-Ass Dolls. Oh, come on. It's not like she's six. She was over the age of majority. Able to drink alcohol in a casino where a stranger offered her and her girlfriends his room to sleep in for the night. So this little picture book is not something that would scar her for life. Or even for a couple of hours. I also gave her Awkward Family Photos. For balance, you know. What's not to like? I would have loved those gifts. In fact, I did. I read them myself before wrapping them. I figured she wouldn't be able to tell.So...we heehawed over those books one Christmas day. Niecy must have loved them so much that she spread the joy. At a family gathering on her dad the ex-mayor's side, her aunt brought this scary gift.Oh, she may not look so scary right there on my living room coffee table. But when you're expecting a regular gift, and pull the lid off this thing, she's pretty scary. You might notice that her left leg has a bad case of elephantiasis. I refuse to take responsibility. She was like that the first time she was given to me last year. No, that knife is not laying there for amputative purposes. It was used to slash open packages for last-minute wrapping.Last night we got Dollee (pronounced like Gomer Pyle said golllllleeeee) down from the upper shelf in the basement workshop. You didn't think I'd have that thing on display in my home all year, did you? So The Pony brought her in at my request, and said, \"You mean THIS doll?\" As if I have another creepy doll laying around. It was actually The Pony who brought the renewed bout of creepiness to the forefront. \"I don't know why her right leg is hairy.\"WHAT?I thought he meant her misshapen left leg. Though I myself would not have termed it hairy. \"Oh, that's just her big leg. Remember? I think it melted in somebody's attic all those years between childhood and latter middle age.\"\"No. Not that one. The other leg.\"I looked closer. But not TOO close. \"Eww! Get that thing away from me! Take it up to your dad and tell him he needs to wash it! That's MOLD. MOLD growing on Dollee's good leg! Yuck. Get it out of here!\"\"Mom. It's not mold. It's white.\"\u00a0\"Yeah. So? It's not normal. What do YOU think it is.\"\"I don't know. Um. Hair?\"\u00a0\"Like a creepy doll is going to grow hair on its plastic leg. Get that upstairs and tell Dad. It may look like white hair, but that's hyphae!\"Hick dutifully scrubbed Dollee of her fungus. I suppose she was just laying around decomposing for the past year. If you think that's bad...the ex-mayor ripped her fat leg off last night. I have yet to hear the details.I will not be looking forward to any gifts from my niece next Christmas. Maybe she will discover a new cure like the old penicillin.Dollee.

This is a collection of prizes for the impending competitions at my sister the ex-mayor's wife's party this evening. It is my second year to be in charge of the swag. There are actually more gift bags, but The Pony only chose the ones that appealed to him for the picture. I have a sneaking suspicion that he is especially fond of the pink-and-red striped Victoria's Secret bag. The rules are that small prizes must only cost a dollar, and three grand prizes must cost between five and ten dollars each. We had a delightful time selecting these treasures.In case you have a pair of bifocals finally liberated from The Charlatans Optical Delusions Emporium and Professional Prevaricators Shoppe, allow me to elaborate on what you are looking at. We have a pair of felt reindeer horns wrapped around a peppermint note-pad with candy-cane striped pencil, a festive serving tray, a mug with double-chocolate cocoa powder, a gingerbread man soap dispenser, a tube of tiny festive foil bows and ribbon, a bag of Gummi Worms, a box of Skittles, a Santa rubber ducky, cookie cutters, a Christmas tree soap dispenser, a Christmas tree flip-top jar, a Playful Pigs calendar, a squeaky felt squid dog toy, a four-pack of assorted jams, and a ceramic Santa with floppy plaid legs, suitable for mantle-sitting.

Each stepson gets one, and we have one for the Mom gathering, and then I made one a few weeks back for Thanksgiving. All of a sudden, I have forgotten how to bake a boxed cake mix. Or so it would seem.Each of the cakes have had issues with the center remaining gooey. It can't be all my fault. I follow the instructions to a T. It doesn't matter whether I use store-bought eggs or our own chicken fruit. I used the same measuring cup. I bake at the recommended temperature, for the recommended time. Herein lies the problem. I think my oven is broken.Here's a major clue. In all of my episodes of Chex Mix creation this year, the big roasting pan that I place on the top shelf of the oven has tried to burn. It doesn't, because I stir it every 15 minutes. But that pan gets darker than the others. Here's the key piece of evidence. On that first batch of Chex Mix, a single Cheerio fell out of a pan and onto the oven floor. This has happened in years past, and before that batch of Chex Mix is done, any droppings have been incinerated to a tiny smidgen of charcoal. This single Cheerio lives on. It is as golden as the day it was milled and extruded in the factory. And it's laying just below the bottom coil! I left it there to see if it would burn up. A kind of science experiment, you know. And also because I'm lazy, and bending over even one more time after 18 bends during a Chex Mix episode is too much.I think my bottom coil is broken. That would explain the top coil working overtime, heating that upper Chex Mix, and the bottoms of my cakes remaining gooey. I told Hick this morning that I think my bottom coil is broken. Do you know what he said, after a loaded pause, in a you-are-too-dumb-to-understand voice?\"Are you putting it on bake, or broil?\"Give me a freakin' break already! As if I have used that oven for 25 years and still have not mastered the ol' BAKE/BROIL conundrum!Of course, in Hick's mind, that scenario is far more plausible than a 25-year-old oven having a part that might need to be replaced.Val don't get no respect."}, {"title": "We Are Not a Family of Finery or Filligree", "date": "Monday, December 23, 2013", "text": "Dashing off to townIn a 4-wheel-drive TahoeMaking road walkers frown Laughing ho ho hoTime is running outTo grab last-minute giftsFor that crazy loutIn Good Feet Store liftsOh, Dollar Store, Save a Lot,Big Lots, Dollar Tree,Found it in\u00a0 The local Family CenterA push-broom glory be! Oh...Dollar Store, Save a Lot,Big Lots, Dollar TreeGarage puddle must be sweptBefore Val breaks a knee!Yes. The Pony and I made about ten stops today, the first of which was at The Family Center to find a push-broom. We used to have one hanging in the garage. The Pony used it to shove out the puddle of meltwater that drains from T-Hoes tires and flanks after an outing in the snow. Overnight, that puddle has a tendency to freeze. And we don't have a flock of geese to fly away with it, like the lake in that story Idgie Threadgoode told Old Smokey Lonesome right before giving him a snort of Old Joe from a pint in the pocket of her apron in Fried Green Tomatoes.That Family Center store is just about abandoned. Nobody is ever at the register. I'm surprised we don't see tumbleweeds somersaulting down the aisles. We turned right just inside the door, on The Pony's advice, and went almost to the end of the building. No push brooms. The Pony swore he saw some last week. There was nobody to ask. We perused the 37 garden varieties of rakes, and looked at long and short axe handles. No push brooms. On the way out, a Grizzly Adams man in a green duck vest greeted us. He was like the Brawny Paper Towel guy gone to seed. \"How ya doin'?\"\"Great. Do you have any push brooms?\" He looked at me like I was as simple as Pangle in Cold Mountain.\"Um. Yes. They're right there, where you came from.\" Brawny Grizzly had to escort us back from whence we came. The fact that he was carrying a large bag of Horse Chow or cedar chips or Sweet Feed over his shoulder did not seem to be an issue. Our city-slicker stupidity did. \"See? The edge of one hanging right there?\"\"No...\"\"There. The blue bristles?\"\"Oh! Yes! Thank you.\" They were on an end cap around the corner from where we stopped looking. The Pony ignored the blue and red, and chose a tasteful black push-broom for Hick at $19.98. Not exactly a $980 pair of Good Feet Store inserts, but an appropriate gift. As I remember, upon being quizzed as to the whereabouts of the old push-broom, which I assumed he had spirited away to the BARn, Hick said, \"I thought that was in the garage.\"The Pony toted it to the register. It was a long walk. \"I thought you said you knew where they were.\"\"Well, I was kind of right. I took you there, I just didn't see it.\"\"If it was a snake, and could strike over a really long distance, it would have bit us.\"\"We were too far away.\"\"If it was a cobra, it could have spit venom in our eyes.\"\"I am wearing glasses. Venom would not hurt me.\"\"Sometimes, can you just go along? I'm creating here.\"\"No comment.\"Thankfully, a cashier crawled from the woodwork. She looked at The Pony. \"Is this a present for you?\"Of course he didn't answer. Just snorted and ducked his head. \"Actually, it's for his dad, but I figure he's going to be using it more.\" Another snort. We stashed the push-broom in T-Hoe's rear. Tomorrow we need to sneak it in. The Pony thinks we should stuff it in the artificial Christmas tree box.\"Nobody will look in there until it's time to take down the Christmas tree.\"I think he's got a point.Hick decreed several years ago that I could no longer have my real Scotch Pine Christmas tree from my Grandma's tree farm in the partially-finished basement, and my artificial Christmas tree in the living room. One was enough, old Scrooge declared. So now I only have Artie the artificial.

A violation of Mrs. Thevictorian's Don't-Do-It List.The dismembering began, and I tried to remain calm. They had promised, had they not? One lad did his part by scavenging all the eyeballs. In fact, he had a whole handful. \"See, Mrs. Thevictorian? Eyes! I won't let any get left on the floor. I'll take them all. The other kids can give them to ME. I'll take care of them.

Mr. Kotter Val's loyal readers!I have my new bifocals! Yes, they've been a long time coming. If you count the date they were ordered, November 15th, to the day I was notified to pick them up, December 18th, and add them up--I was only without my bifocals for a mere 33 days. Surely anybody can go without reading for that amount of time, right? Who cares whether a teacher can calculate grades? Who cares whether a wife can write out checks to pay bills? Who cares if a medicated individual can read the labels on the pill bottles? Obviously, the answer is: NOT the employees of The Charlatans Optical Delusions Emporium and Professional Prevaricators Shoppe.Good thing Val is a crafty wench with a penchant for hoarding, and had a pair of two-year-old bifocals on hand to tide her over.Do you want the good news or the bad news first? Oh, come on. Who am I kidding? There is no good news, silly! There is only bad news and not-quite-as-bad news. The not-quite-as-bad news is that I can see fairly well with them now, and I got a free hard case (which looks like it's for kids' glasses, and has a sticky mark like somebody peeled off the label and decided they didn't want it). The bad news is that the pain-in-my-rumpus, tooth-sucking, keyboard-pounding, not-listening hag who caused me the majority of my seven trips back to that office had to get in the last word upon pick-up.I KNOW! Aren't you simply incensed for me?I went to pick them up after school and a rendezvous with my best old teaching buddy, Mabel. The\u00a0 Charlatans Optical Delusions Emporium and Professional Prevaricators Shoppe closes at 5:00. I arrived at 4:50. When I dared pass through their unlocked portal, I was greeted with dead-eyed stares from the two counter Cerberuses whose job it is to discourage repeat customers. \"What can I do for you?\" snarled the right-hand Cerberus.\"I got a call that my glasses are ready.\"\"Sit over there and someone will be with you.\"Huh. You might think some further information might be necessary. A customer's name, perhaps. In order to dole out the proper pair of glasses. But wait! Maybe that's the problem! All glasses are generic, so nobody can see out of them. Yeah. That explains a lot.I had no desire to sit down, having just sat on my ample duff chatting with Mabel until T-Hoe's warm leather duff-receptacle was begging for mercy. So I headed for the corral where they herded me, and stood compliantly behind a chair. I was almost bowled over by a large man of questionable hairstyle wearing baby-blue scrubs and carrying a large, see-through trash bag full of...well...visible trash. \"Oh. Excuse me.\" He headed past me and toward the inner sanctum. About the room, like so many catatonic nighttime rainwalkers in the original Halloween, were other folks who had come to get their glasses. I'd say there were at least five. Which explained why the parking lot was so full. They were being fitted, outwitted, and coaxed into believing that of course they couldn't see clearly, because their eyes needed to adjust to the new glasses.\"Ma'am?\" Trash Man was standing behind the counter, beckoning to me! How did he know which glasses were mine? He didn't know my name. Nobody had asked. I figure they labeled me as DIFFICULT in my file, and had tacked up a copy of my driver's license photo behind the counter, with a bonus for the person who could make me disappear permanently. \"Let me get you a chair.\"\"No. I don't need a chair. The frames are my old ones. All I need to do is look through them to see if I can see.\"THEN IT HAPPENED! Pain-in-My-Rumpus, Tooth-Sucking, Keyboard-Pounding, Not-Listening Hag walked by behind me. Yes. Cruella The Pill dared to insert herself into my seventh payless transaction. \"She reads from that distance, standing up.\" I think I detected scorn in her tone. Sarcasm. Delusions of adequacy from that two-fingered keyboard whacker who is most likely the sole reason the computer system is down every time I go in there. Which is frequently!I really wanted to turn around and slug her. Almost as much as that cutesy frat boy at Harrah's Casino who pulled my crank. But I refrained. Didn't want to break my new glasses, you know.The very NERVE of some people! I am the customer. I am always right. At least when it comes to deciding whether I can see well enough out of my glasses to do my job. I paid several tens of thousands of pretty pennies for those new lenses that were withheld from me for 33 days. I don't care how much Cruella The Pill wants to heckle me, I am the one who knows how I function at work. The distance at which I read is not up for debate. But apparently, it IS up for ridicule.

I also saw the actual meal an hour later, on a hard plastic compartmented tray, of chicken patty on bun, mashed potatoes, green beans, and a box of Sunmaid raisins. Only the chicken patty came close to what I was smelling. I chalked it up to an olfactory hallucination.At home, as I warmed up some food in the oven, I sliced The Pony a tiny treat to tide him over.

Polished them until they shone. Let them sit. Honed them to a sharpness uncommon in Val's meandering cutlery parade. I paid close attention to the deadline.

Or a big ol' cedar if you're not in the spirit yet, though that would be hard to believe, with radio stations playing carols since before Thanksgiving.

You never know how the country road is going to be cleared, and his phone is dead for about 60 miles through the middle of nowhere. And it could be a long walk to find a house if he ran off the road. By 12:45, I was getting a little anxious. So I called.\"Are you about ready to leave?\"\"I am just now pulling onto the highway.\"\"I thought you were going to call me.\"\"I was. But I forgot.\"\"Do you have the 4WD on?\"\"Well, seeing as how I'm driving 70 mph down the highway...no.\"\"Which way are you coming home?\"\"I'm going the back roads. It's quicker.\"\"Put it in 4WD when you get off the highway. Just in case.\"\"Yeah, yeah.\"He made it home. And reported that our road is terrible. Yeah. Tell us something we don't know. He also commanded, from 30 miles away, that I move my car from its rightful garage slot to Hick's garage slot. No mention of where Hick was supposed to park. His reasoning was that all of his stuff was near the passenger side, and he couldn't open his door with it against the garage wall that is too close because Hick wouldn't listen to me when building this house, and add a couple of feet to make it more spacious for big honkin' 4WD beasts. Oh, and since he has no garage door opener, he suggested that I make The Pony run out and open the garage door when he got to the driveway.When asked, after opening his birthday presents from Wednesday, if it he was glad to be home, Genius replied, \"Well, I'm glad that classes are over.\" Huh. He also made some crack about how he loved living in the dorm, because he cranked the heat up to 76, and that conditions around this place were barbaric. I'll toughen up that buttercup forthwith. Or tell him he will have to pay half of the electric bill for the month he's home. And, he complained that when he moved his truck out of the garage, there was no place to park, because Hick's $1000 Caravan was in his place!Furthermore, he commandeered The Pony's corn dog that Hick brought him from town on the way home from work, for a snack before supper, then opened up the puppy chow mix that I won by NOT cheating at my niece's baby shower and ate about half, then decided he wanted part of the salad The Pony was having for supper along with some fish, then saw a hot dog on the pan next to the fish, and decided he also wanted that with his salad and fish and just-commenced-digesting puppy chow and corn dog.Ha ha! The joke was on Genius. He fell asleep on the couch before finishing his plate. He was all done up like Bear Grylls in Antarctica, what with a hoodie pulled around his face, hands warming on bare belly under the hoodie pouch and shirt, socked feet dug down in the crack between cushion and couch arm.I think his last words were, \"I'm soooo coooold.\""}, {"title": "Out Here, We Use a Swimming Pool For De-Icing Purposes", "date": "Friday, December 13, 2013", "text": "This is the reason I have had an 11-day weekend from school since last Thursday. Road conditions are bad in Backroads. Still. Oh, the main thoroughfares are clear enough. But the back roads of Backroads are not.Hick has been driving on borrowed time, in a $1000 Caravan. He's not one to listen to the voice of reason, which we all know is Val's voice. Nope. Gotta drive the backroadsiest back roads in Backroads, that one. Thinks he's invincible. I must admit, he's never had a weather-related accident (knock on my laminated faux-wood butcher-block countertop laminate that Hick lovingly installed as a built-in desk in my dark basement lair). He refuses to take the highway all the way from work to town, then out the main drag to our county road. Hick takes a short cut. I don't know how he's made it so far.This afternoon, Hick called at 4:24. I assumed he was just leaving work. There's a wide window of departure time, Hick not being one to punch a time clock. But no. He was calling from the bottom of our hill, a scant half-mile from home. \"I can't get up the hill. Neighbor lady is here, too. And she just lives at the top of the hill. We're stuck. It's solid ice. Some guy has gone to get ashes. He said he'd be right back.\"\"I don't know what I can do for you.\" That did not mean I couldn't drive almost a half-mile and bring him home. There was the matter of the $1000 Caravan. After 15 minutes, I called him back. \"Do you want me to drive down and pick you up? Or have The Pony throw a bale of hay into T-Hoe?\" Hay. I saw that yesterday when I went to town to get one of Hick's presents. The farm and home center had thoughtfully broken open a bale of hay and scattered it over the ice spots on the parking lot. No salt for them. Of course I couldn't mention to Hick how I knew this might work, because then he would know that I went to buy the only gift he has requested.\"No. I'm getting ready to try it now.\" About ten minutes later he arrived home. Then I got the full story.Neighbor Lady had tried to get up that hill in her four-door sedan. She drives it all the time. We've both been getting in and out with no trouble, up and down that solid sheet of hill ice. That's because we're used to it. Plus, I have four-wheel drive. Then today's storm rolled in around noon. It was 34 degrees when we left, and 31 degrees when we got back. I told The Pony I was worried about freezing rain, because that will zap our power. Anyhoo...back to the story of the ice hill.Neighbor Lady had driven to the city to pick up her son from college. He's Genius's age. She also had her other son, The Pony's age, with her. They had done the grocery shopping, and were just getting home. Almost. She got her sedan kind of sideways on the winding gravel ice hill. Hick came along, and decided he would just go around her. He only made it halfway up. His trusty $1000 Caravan with its two-year-old snow tires started to slide backwards down the hill. As Hick said, \"So I put it in the ditch and parked it. Then I walked up to the top, with her boys, who were supposed to get some salt. When we walked back down, the ash guy was there. He had a kid's swimming pool full of ashes from his outside wood furnace. They were still hot. He scattered them, and the boys spread out salt. Neighbor Lady's husband was there by then, and he was walking up to get his truck. I rolled the Caravan back down, and made it to the top.\"Seriously. They should have sold tickets. Strewn about on that little section of road were a four-door sedan, a $1000 Caravan, a truck with a swimming pool full of ashes, and a panel work van. All they needed was a clown car.Three to five inches tonight. I hope Genius makes it home tomorrow. It would be so sad if he got within a half mile, and had to live in a van down by the river until time to leave for spring semester."}, {"title": "What an Ambitious Three-Dollar Daughter Does On a Day Off", "date": "Thursday, December 12, 2013", "text": "In case any of you have been wondering about how my mom and her holey gray sweatpants are getting along in this slaw-forsaken frozen landscape...I'm here to fill you in. Just one more service Val offers her future proposed-handbasket-factory customers.Mom has not left her house since last Wednesday, when the forecast called for 4-6 inches of sleet and snow. After the 10+ inches covered her homestead, she has remained indoors, except for venturing to her roadside mailbox yesterday, with the aid of crampons and an ice axe. Okay. So it was a set of strap-on YakTrax shoe cleat springy things, and a yellow-handled angled kitchen broom. She makes do. She's a regular MacGyver, my mom.Today I had to go to Walmart without my trusty helper, in order to pick up a few Christmas items, and I called Mom to see if she wanted to ride along, or if I could bring her anything. We've been dropping off chili and pulled pork and shower cake and slaw and honey-roasted nuts and Diet Coke, and yesterday Mom received a package of fruity goodness from Harry and David, or Larry and David, or somebody else and David, the mail-order folks. All the major food groups have been accounted for, unless you want to count vegetables and grains. But here's what Mom said she needed, in case tomorrow's storm traps her for another week: Little Debbie Swiss Rolls, and ripe bananas. I added them to my list. On the way to town, I had a horrible thought. What if Mom was running low on slaw? I called her from the parking lot, just in case.\"Oh! I never even thought about the slaw! Yes. Get me some more slaw while you're there.\" See? For those of you who believe in using foreshadowing while crafting your stories...perhaps Val is about to rise above Three-Dollar Daughterdom. I told Mom I would call her when I came out, and run by her house. Perhaps she might like to join me for a ride to the bank to put money in Genius's account so he can make it home from college.In the checkout line, my phone rang. \"Are you all right? I was getting worried. I thought you'd be done by now. I was afraid you might have fallen on the ice and hit your head.\"\"No, Mom. I'm fine. I'm checking out. Then I'll be there.\"\"Oh. I didn't mean to bother you. I was just worried.\"That little call threw a monkey wrench into my plan to secretly drive through Burger King and get Mom those one-dollar pork sandwiches she forgot last week. At least I had the surprise of mini-cupcakes with buttercream icing. Mom loves buttercream icing. Just like my best old ex-teaching buddy, Mabel.When I pulled into her driveway (only allowed because the ex-mayor went down it without permission, and made a couple of icy compacted ruts a few days ago) Mom came out with her arctic gear. Coat, scarf, sunglasses, crampons, and that ice-axe broom. I had suggested the broom several days ago, in case she wanted to walk to her mailbox through the yard. I thought it could act as a walking stick. You know, upside down, with the handle stabbing down into the snow. Of course Mom was holding the handle, pushing the angled synthetic straws into the snow. I called her on it. \"Well, I just feel like I get better traction with that end.\"Mom was worried that her snowy crampons would wreck T-Hoe's floor. Um. No. T-Hoe does not go about naked. He is outfitted with proper floor mats. Then Mom worried that she has not had a bath lately, because she wasn't going anywhere (who is she now, Beaver Cleaver?), and that her odor might be offensive. \"Mom! I teach freshmen. I think I can handle it.\" We took off for the bank. Mom shielded her sunglassed eyes. She was like a mole just emerged from the tunnels in her yard.After the bank, I drove her by to see the middle finger. \"Oh, no! Somebody put that in the yard? That is terrible.\" She laughed a little too much. She must have thought I was pulling her non-gray-holey-sweatpantsed leg. When we arrived at the intersection, that big bird had flown. Or else it was blocked by a car on the street, and a truck in the driveway. I looked right at where it had been, but it was not in evidence. Mom was disappointed.\"Well, we're already halfway to Burger King. I'm going to take you to get what was supposed to be your surprise: three pork sandwiches.\"\"Oh! You don't have to do that. I finally figured out how to open those little containers of BBQ sauce your sister brought with the pulled pork. I can have that.\"\"We could get you a Diet Coke...\"\"Oh. A Diet Coke? Where were you going to get that?\"\"Burger King, I thought. But I know how you like McDonald's Diet Coke, so we can go across the street and get your soda there.\"\"That's too much trouble. You are SO good to me. I don't want to take up all your time. We could just go to McDonald's, and I can get three of those grilled onion cheddar burgers along with my Diet Coke. If it's not too much trouble.\"\"Nope. That's where we'll go.\" I figured she can freeze two burgers as easily as two pork sandwiches. Though I don't see the attraction in reheated fast food myself. She held that bag on her lap the rest of the way home. I hope she's one of those weathered, apple-headed, pipe-smoking, yogurt-eating 115-year-olds one of these days, attributing her longevity to grilled onion cheddar burgers and Little Debbie cakes. AND SLAW!It takes so little to make Mom happy. I obviously take after my dad. And for the record, Mom gave me $15 for her purchases, and said to keep what was left over.

Perhaps explainable, if only I could decipher the code. It started with a noise. Think of a teenage boy standing outside the undoored door of your dark basement lair, clacking two remote controls together. That's what it sounded like to me. So I called out, \"Pony! What are you doing?\" And he answered me. From the couch at the other end of the basement.\"Nothing! What are YOU doing?\"\"Nothing! I thought you were making that noise.\"\"I thought YOU were making that noise.\"We heard it again. Once. Twice. Seriously. WHAT WAS THAT? It was not outside on the porch. That's a thumping sound we hear from the wrasslin' dogs and the tread of delivery men. It was not inside my office. It was just outside the door. Just past the NASCAR bathroom. The Pony ran over. He stepped into my office.\"Are you SURE it wasn't you?\"\"Yes! Are you sure it wasn't YOU?\"\"Uh huh. I know it was over here.\" He walked around, looking for items that might have fallen off the shelves. \"It didn't sound like it was inside here. Maybe it was these empty soda cans out here on the desk.\" He stepped back out, to the aluminum Coke cans awaiting crushing after waiting to be stashed in an old Walmart bag after waiting to dry out after rinsing. He squeezed one. \"That's what I thought it might have been. These cans expanding due to a change in air pressure. But none of them have been bent. And listen, that's not the sound.\" He squeezed another.\"And even if it was, how come they have never, ever made a noise like that before? I don't know. Listen. There it was again!\" By this time, The Pony had stepped back inside my office. We could clearly see that neither of us was doing anything to cause the sound.I give up. I have no idea what it was. After that last one, it stopped. Quite odd. In broad daylight in my dark basement lair.And the noises that used to occur overhead in Genius's room at night, right after he moved off to college...the ones that stopped about a month later? They returned this week.

Ten plus inches of snow, and nowhere, NOWHERE, have I spied a single snowman.Do the kids of today not sense that a snow day is a precious playday to be cherished? Are they tiny conspiracy theorists, avoiding that Fukushima-tainted snow like the plague? Do they lay about, clicking their keyboards and think pad notebook surface gadget thingies and smart phones? One would suppose a child would get tired of that after a six-day weekend, and head out into the yard with a two lumps of coal, a carrot, a scarf, a pork-pie hat and two dead branches ripped from a neighbor's tree. But there was ne'er a snowman to be found along all the roads of Backroads.

It would have been taller, but some unfortunate accident had amputated that digit at the second joint.WHAT IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE?As soon as this snow melts, I shall renew my lackadaisical efforts to get my proposed handbasket factory up and running.

I swear, I could start a separate blog. Let's try to narrow the topic to a single post office, and two specific visits. There IS a common theme. And that theme is VAL'S PERSONAL SPACE HAS BEEN VIOLATED. Excuse me. Sometimes I have to let it out.Last Tuesday, I had a sick day to let the phlebotomist bruise my arm. Of course, I still had to go to school and pick up The Pony. It takes about 35 minutes to get there from home at top speed. I generally allow 40 minutes, just to be comfortable. I knew I had to pick up a package at the dead-mouse-smelling post office on the way, so I left 10 minutes early. I pass right by.The universe continues to thwart Val's every plan. Before I even got to the dead-mouse-smelling post office, I had to dodge a barreling UPS truck, weave around a county highway department wood chipper on the blind fluffy dog curve (uh, blind curve, not blind dog), and follow a car on the county road that drove slower than my mom. Still. I had no idea I would later be an inactive participant in seven school buses stopping. So I was sure I had time to dash in for my package.When did the dead-mouse-smelling post office turn into Walmart, where you are always tenth in line? I didn't get the memo. But since I was already stopped, and thought I had time, and had already counted the obstacles between me and the counter, I stayed. Send a package. Stamps. Registered letter. Package pick-up. Moving mail-forwarding form. Send a package. Stamps. Then the problem guy.Problem Guy didn't know he was a problem. He had been minding his own business in line, scooting forward a thigh-high rectangular box with his foot. When he was next to next in line, he called somebody on his cell phone. \"What's in here, anyway?\" At the counter, he said he needed to ship it overseas in time for Christmas. The worker lady told him today was the last day. She put it on the scale, and told him it would cost $22. Did he want insurance? Yes. Contents worth $50. Then Worker Lady said, \"Hold up. I think it's oversize.\" She whipped out her metal tape measure. Yep. Oversize. So it was going to cost $42. He did not complain. Just sighed and took out his wallet again. Worker Lady apologetically told him that if his package had weighed more, she wouldn't have needed to charge him for his package being oversize.Here is the drama part. Yeah. People HAVE told me I have trouble getting to the point. There was only one lady between me and Problem Guy. But many other delayed customers had filed in after me. The old man directly behind me started heckling. \"You mean if he put some rocks in that package, it would cost him less to mail?\" Worker Lady agreed. \"Yes. Unfortunately, the post office says that since they're not making money off your freight charge, they're going to make you pay more for taking up room.\" Huh. Problem Guy did not really engage. The box contained Christmas ornaments. Not good candidates for stowaway rocks.But that's still not the theme of this story. The lady behind the Buttinsky guy would not stay in her place. From the minute she came in, she was a creeper. Buttinsky maintained the normal personal space that we older North Americans are accustomed to. Creeper was like a claim jumper. All at once she was between Buttinsky and me. Like she was going to jump on my back for a proper fireman's carry to the counter. The next minute she was under my left armpit. Then a step ahead of me. A regular Waldo. She was not stealthy, either. She kept popping up like a Whack-A-Mole. I only yearned for a mallet.Problem Guy was shunted to the side to fill out paperwork. The lady ahead of me presented her orange postcard for a package. Worker Lady laid it on the counter and went to the back room. She returned with that package, and two for me, which she had to scan to show they hadn't lost them. She knows me on sight now. Worker Lady nodded at me as she handed over the previous lady's package. I laid my orange postcards on the counter next to the other one. THERE WAS CREEPER! She was in front of me. Craning her neck, looking at those cards like she was memorizing our addresses. WHAT IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE?In case anyone cares, I was ten minutes late to pick up The Pony. I only share that because I wanted to tie up that loose end before dwelling on the real issue here with my personal post office experience.Today I had to pick up another two packages. The Pony was with me, but I had some jawing to do about a package missing since last Thursday, so I let him wait in the car. Perhaps I misspoke in comparing the dead-mouse-smelling post office to Walmart. Today I was only ninth in line. I can't even remember what the people head of me were doing, because I was so incensed about the man behind me.Directly in front of me was a young mother with a baby in a basket, and a five-year-old. The baby was sweet, and the fiver didn't stare. Perfect. Except for that old man behind me. He kept sighing. I understood the need. But with every sigh, I felt the hair on the back of my neck part. Then he started doing the motorboat lip-flapping raspberry sound with each exhale. Like an old nag flapping its horse lips. I didn't want to turn. I moved forward as far as I could without setting the fiver to staring. Mr. Ed moved closer. I could feel the heat coming off his body. Except I was not Bear Grylls on the Irish moors, freezing my buttocks off, eating sheep eyeballs and stripping the hide for a makeshift sleeping bag. I was in no danger of hypothermia. I sighed. Half turned without looking. Hoping Mr. Ed would get the hint. He did not. I ran out of room to edge away from him. I turned my shoulders just a bit, to look out the window at T-Hoe. It couldn't have been more than a quarter turn. I didn't even move my feet. But that slight motion sent Mr. Ed's dangling hand, wrist, and forearm into the crack of my very buttocks! THE HORROR!I heaved a heavy sigh of disapproval. Mr. Ed snorted. Not even an apology. I'm starting to think he was some kind of perv. I refused to turn my back to him again. I turned sideways, so he was at my shoulder. I hated that, because then his breath was on the side of my face. I wanted to grab his shoulders and shove him away. I sidled my way through the rest of the line. When my turn came at the counter, I moved off the the side. Right in the middle of the two stations. So it would have looked odd for him to ease up directly behind me again. WHAT IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE?I could never ride a train in India. Or even the New York subway."}, {"title": "So I Was Feeling a Little Down...", "date": "Sunday, December 8, 2013", "text": "Come on in! Here. Let me take your coat. What's that? Oh, I'm not laying it across the bed in the back bedroom...I'm keeping it. Sorry. You should have asked sooner. Go pick your seat. Heh, heh. I never get tired of that one.Thank you all for showing up for my event on such short notice. It's not every day one gets an invite to a pity party. I truly appreciate your support. Some days Val can take anything the old world throws her way, and other days she's a quivering glob of plain gelatin. Take last night, for instance. I was feeling especially vulnerable, what with my championship plastic-baby-thawing performance, and the subsequent accusation of cheating. You'd have though I took an icepick to that glacierized inanimate infant. That put my nose out of joint. Then I read comments on the reportage of my victory.The magic of ordinary days would have seen me viewing those comments through my rose-colored glasses (assuming I had them back from The Charlatans Optical Delusions Emporium and Professional Prevaricators Shoppe), taking such jibes in stride, like Jackie Joyner-Kersee over hurdles in her heyday, acknowledging the typewritten banter as a case of ganderfying the goose, giving Val a taste of her own medicine, fair play in a turnabout. However...I was still smarting from the announcement in front of the entire baby shower crowd that since I win everything, I must have cheated! I swear. That proclamation was as shocking as the time Ellen DeGeneres leaned over that sitcom airport microphone and BLARED to the sitcom airport and TV viewing audience, \"I'm gay!\" It took me by surprise. Probably more than Ellen's announcement took anyone by surprise.So I was smarting, you see. My virtual 44 oz. Diet Coke cup was half empty, not half full. I started grousing about my image. How I am perceived by the masses of baby shower attendees and blog readers. A quick scroll through past comment sections seemed to point to an unavoidable fact. Val is a bragging, win-at-all-costs, husband-wood-chipping, menopausal, insane-asylum-bound, pencil-wielding eyeball-stabber who wears clothing made from dinner napkins, releases enough gaseous emissions to single-handedly warm the globe, cares not enough about her pets to let them reside inside, with an identity that is very hard to be. No wonder that tooth-sucker who works at The Charlatans Optical Delusions Emporium and Professional Prevaricators Shoppe looked at me like I was something she scraped off her shoe, that looked like a chunk of mystery meat filler that fell out of her Walmart Chicken Chimichanga, that resembled a cooked version of the blob that comes out of a patient's midriff during psychic surgery.Let's all grab our Walmart stuck-together paper plates and move to the serving table. Do NOT take an extra fork! We have the main course all respectable pity parties, fried worms, along with a bit of crow, some humble pie for dessert, and a choice of Val's salty tears or hemlock tea (sweetened and unsweetened) for the beverage.\"What about games?\" you ask. We will have the 44 oz. Diet Coke Chugging contest. The Thaw Val's Cold, Cold Heart contest (no fair removing Val's heart for heating). The Putting On Big Girl Panties contest, where participants must dress themselves in 10 pairs of granny panties and run across the room without picking their seat. The Soup-Stacking contest. And the Spin Juno And See Who Chews Her Nose contest. Prizes will be awarded at the discretion of Val, consisting of various and sundry treasures collected over the years by Hick at auctions and flea markets. Sorry, the Department of Health prohibits the dispensation of Auction Meat.I hope you all enjoy my little soiree. I think it will be good for what ails me. Tomorrow Val will be back to her Mother Teresa/Pollyanna/Mary Poppins self, writing about fluffy kittens, gamboling puppies, silky unicorns, rainbows, and lollipops.Like a post-apocalyptic roach, Val is a survivor."}, {"title": "Val Thevictorian, Infant Dispatcher", "date": "Saturday, December 7, 2013", "text": "Val is a woman of many talents. Why, just this evening, she delivered a baby. Oh, not only did she deliver that baby, Val delivered that baby faster than all the other baby deliverers, relying on her old standby of spouting hot air, without even using her hands, without dropping the baby as some butterfingered deliverers did, and without licking the baby's buttocks.Okay. I went to my niece's baby shower. All attendees were given a plastic shot glass containing a Mardi Gras cake type plastic baby frozen in an ice cube. The first person to get the baby out of the ice cube, without using hands, sticking anything in the glass, taking the ice cube out of the glass, or submerging that shot glass in hot coffee, was the winner. Here is my prize:It's a hermetically-sealed jar of chocolate-covered cereal, powdered-sugar-coated Puppy Chow. That's what my sister the ex-mayor's wife calls it, anyway. Oh, and there's the bouncing baby of indeterminate gender that I delivered. I can't believe the rest of the faux midwives were not happier for my victory. It kind of hurt my feelings that there was such a sigh of resignation, and several shouts of disbelief. Let's see...I think the glowing lady of honor's exact words were: \"I should have known you'd win. You win everything. You must have cheated.\" So hurtful. I'm of half a mind not to participate in the Christmas contests at her mother's house this year. I'll show them! I won't win a thing.Here's my baby-delivery strategy. First of all, when the tray of frozen babies is paraded around the room for selection, and you grab one with a big fat ice cube, hand it immediately to Hick, and take another one. Then start breathing. Yeah. Right into that little plastic shot glass. Nothing melts the ice like a blow-hard. Don't follow the tactics of the poor clueless males on either side of you. Much as he thinks he has cracked the code of baby delivery, The Pony's method of banging the cup on a plastic plate REPEATEDLY does not work. I suppose he was trying to crack it open like an egg. Nor do you want to adopt Hick's mode of putting that plastic shot glass containing an ice cube with a baby frozen inside down the neck of your long-sleeved gray T-shirt and into your hairy armpit. If you feel lightheaded from all that exhaling, don't take a chance on hyperventilating and losing valuable baby-thawing time. Swirl that shot glass so the baby's newly-exposed parts are bathed in the melt-water. That helps free the baby from the ice. When you hear the baby clinking against the cube, raise your glass high and shout, \"My baby is loose!\" Then nod and say, \"Uh huh!\" when those in charge say they don't think so.The Pony's favorite part was the foot cookies. I kind of enjoyed the centerpieces. Yes. She's expecting a girl.We left before the next game, and the drawing for the grand prize for those who also brought a package of Huggies. Our roads are ice-covered, and we didn't want to be out too late. Besides, if Hick had won the diaper drawing, I fear that the mob might have come after us with flaming torches.Val.

When I saw my dire situation, I realized that such a layer of fluffy precipitation mean only one thing:NO 44 OZ. DIET COKE!Yes, it was Val's own personal nightmare. A day off work, and no magical elixir to keep her company. Woe was Val. By 11:30, she had pulled herself up by her own bootstraps, turned her frown upside down, and taken matters into her own hands.\"Hey! Pony! Do we have any Diet Coke?\" The soda is housed in the basement, right across from the ancient mini-fridge in the alcove under the stairwell, theoretically to be stocked for cool consumption by The Pony.\"I think so. Let me check. Yes. We have two.\"\"You'd better mean two cold, not two total. You're good about saying we have soda, and then admitting after the shopping trip that you meant we had two left, so we had soda.\"\"No, there are more in the box. I'll put some in now.\"\"When you come up to put away your laundry, bring those two cold ones.\"Of course this was a simple task. I even told him to set them aside so there was no doubt as to which two cans were cold. The Pony galloped up the stairs and stashed his folded clothing. I saw him bring the two cans of Diet Coke with him. I gave him a few more chores. Carry the laundry basket back to the laundry room. Put the washed clothes in the dryer. Hang fresh towels. I went to whip him up some lunch. Put away the clean silverware, which included five spoons and 21 forks. Yeah. Gasp along with me. TWENTY-ONE FORKS! Apparently, forks are used around this house in a ratio of 4:1 where spoons are concerned. Sure, there's the matter of that remainder. But we won't count that. What do you think I am, an algebra teacher? Of course nobody admits to the excessive use of forks. It seems as if the dudes in my house march to the tune of their very own poetry:Forks, forks, the magical utensil.The more you use, the more Val wants your eye as a target for her pencil.But we're not fighting the Battle of Excessive Forks today. We're talking about the weather becoming a disabler for my 44 oz. Diet Coke addiction. And The Pony acting as an accomplice. I turned to get those two cold Diet Coke cans out of Frig. I saw The Pony bring them up. And so he did. There they sat. On the cutting block. Three feet away from Frig.After sighing heavily, hoping The Pony could hear me all the way down in the basement while playing with his Wii, I gathered those two cans and the rest of my makings. I detest the taste of Diet Coke in a can. So I scouted the kitchen for extra ingredients. There was a time when I loved me some Cherry Diet Coke from Sonic. Then it closed. I also developed a citrus tooth for Diet Coke with lime. But all I had was canned Diet Coke. I grabbed a 44 oz. cup normally reserved for my refills. Set Frig to 'crush' and filled the bottom compartment of the cup. Then added a few half-moon cubes. I knew I had no cherries. No limes. No lemons. Nothing to spice up metal-tasting Diet Coke. Wait a minute! What was that over on the table by the window? A tall rectangular plastic canister. TWO! Aha! Powdered drink mix. Hmm...cherry. And cherry limeade! That's right. Great Value Sugar Free Cherry Limeade Drink Mix.I sprinkled some of that powder on top of my ice. Added the first can of Diet Coke. Let it foam down. Added the second can. Let it foam down. Stuck a straw in it. Mmm! Tasty! Just right. Now I have a backup drink when the weather conspires against me.Thanks, Genius, for asking for that drink mix way back in the summer. Thanks, Hick, for not drinking the mix that you stashed in your special treat area.I think I can ride out this storm just fine."}, {"title": "There Are None So Blind as Those Who Patronize The Charlatans Optical Delusions Emporium and Professional Prevaricators Shoppe", "date": "Thursday, December 5, 2013", "text": "I know this might be hard to fathom...but Val has an issue.You might recall that I had an optometrist appointment on November 15th, and ordered two new pairs of lenses. I am still waiting for a working pair of bifocals. Since NOVEMBER 15th.Let's see. I had that appointment, then went in the next week to have my lenses put into my frames, since The Charlatans Optical Delusions Emporium and Professional Prevaricators Shoppe left me a message that they were ready. Wrongo. Only the distance lenses were ready.I received another call when the bifocal lenses came in. I went to the Shoppe and had them put in. I told the lady I couldn't see, and she said my eyes had to adjust. I called the next day and took them back. I was chastised for not telling the Doc that I use them for computer viewing. Which I don't. I just wanted to see my gradebook laying on my desk. That gal said I needed them switched from a 12-inch distance to 14 or 16. I told her I didn't think that was enough to read material on the desk. She said she'd fix me up, even called in the newest opto kid doc.Today I braved life and limb in a sleet storm to get those bifocals before becoming housebound. You guessed it. I still could not see with those bifocals. Here's the gist of the interaction. Keep in mind that I was the only customer in the whole establishment. The same quack technician that messed it up the last two times serviced me. Also remember that in my many visits, I\u00a0 overheard THREE other people proclaim that they could not see out of their new glasses.Quacky is one of those older women who make a statement and suck their teeth. Smich. That's what it sounds like. I kind of had the urge to smack her right in the smicher. But that would not have been a ladylike thing to do. I might as well sit with my beskirted knees splayed wide, wear white after Labor Day, or belch the Star Spangled Banner.\"Here. Do you need something to read to try them out?\"\"Can't see. It's like I'm underwater.\"\"Oh, we don't want that. Smich. Maybe you need time for your eyes to adjust to them. Smich. They're new, and you're not used to them. Smich.\"\"That's what you said last time.\"\"Well. Smich. We've adjusted them from a 12-inch reading distance to 14 inches.\"\"I told you last time that wouldn't be enough. It goes from my head to the top of my desk. That's more than 14 inches.\"\"Oh. Smich. I know you're frustrated. Smich. Do you want to take them and try them at work?\"\"No. I did that the first time. I know right now they're not going to work for me. My two-year-old bifocals are better than this. I've been using them for three weeks now.\"\"Do you have them with you?\"\"I'll go get them out of the car.\" Yes. Through the sleet, on their slick sidewalk and parking lot.\"Let me see. Smich. I'll take them back and measure how we have them set. Smich.\" She took my black frames while I experienced a minor panic attack. No good comes of giving those people your frames with working lenses. \"Huh. Smich. The new ones are the same as these. Minus one, plus two. Smich.\"\"I can't explain that. All I know is that I can't see. This has been going on for three weeks.\"\"Well. Smich. I don't know how to say this...smich. But, smich, as we get...smich...older...our eyes change, smich, and get more nearsighted...and don't adjust. Smich.\"\"That's funny. These glasses from two years ago seem just fine. My older eyes don't have a problem with them.\"\"Oh, honey. Smich. I know it's hard to have this problem. Smich. We'll get them fixed. Smich. I'll talk to your doctor. Smich. He's not in today. Smich. Because of the weather. I'll check with him and see what we need to do. Smich. I'll call you.\"\"If you don't get it straightened out this time, I'm done with it. I've been here too many times, and you can't get it right.\"\"I know how you feel, sweetie. Smich. We'll fix it. Smich. Do you want to take your frames?\"\"No. Then it will take longer when I come back to get them. I wish I'd never had new bifocals put in. At least with the old ones I could see. And better than with these two-year-old glasses. I just want the old ones back now.\"\"We'll get it fixed. Smich. I'll call you when they come in.\"Let's tally my trip count, shall we?1-Initial appointment2-Pick up distance lenses only3-Pick up bifocal lenses4-Return bifocal lenses5-Pick up new bifocal lensesWhen I go back to pick them up after the next adjustment, it will be trip number SIX.WHO DO YOU HAVE TO WINK AT IN THIS TOWN TO GET A FUNCTIONAL PAIR OF BIFOCALS?"}, {"title": "You'd Think She Was Talking About Jimmy Choos", "date": "Wednesday, December 4, 2013", "text": "My mom is at it again.

I didn't know they clean shoes. I used Comet.\"\"You used COMET on your shoe soles?\"\"No. Not on the soles.\"\"You used Comet on the LEATHER?\"\"Well, I guess I did. It didn't help any. So I decided to wear my black tennis shoes. They look good with those gray sweatpants. But they're just not comfortable. I can wear those white ones all day, and my feet and legs don't hurt. But they were just too dirty to wear out in public like that.\"\"Yeah. They might have distracted people from the hole in your sweatpants.\"\"Oh, you're terrible! The Dollar Tree was SO busy. There were only two parking spaces out front. I hate it when the store is crowded. I get all nervous. I hurried up and bought some cornbread and some beans. I'm going to cook it with that leftover ham bone from Thanksgiving. I rushed out to the car, and I was so glad to be out of there that I completely forgot that I was going to drive through Burger King and pick up three of those dollar pork sandwiches to put in the freezer and have if I get snowed in.\"\"Well, at least you'll have beans and cornbread.\"\"Mmm...that's going to be so good. I have an onion to slice with it, too.\"\"And you can wear your dirty white shoes and be comfortable.\"\"That's right.

I tried to set her straight on carbon monoxide, and how she should back the truck out of the garage, into the open air, before trying that stunt again. But let's be realistic.

Only $5 a ticket before noon, you know! Of course we had to dig up some sock cash from the back yard for snacks (that were not hauled inside in my movie purse).I would give you a movie review, but the goings-on around us were much more interesting. Not more interesting than the movie, mind you...more interesting than my review.I thought we would arrive 30 minutes before showtime. Somehow Hick's estimate of the journey was shorter than the real thing. Which surprised me entirely. One would think he would have had those items reversed. So...we were only 20 minutes ahead of showtime. That meant that other people were already inside the theater! Thank Even Steven, nobody had taken our 4-row of seats in the back. Oh, two old ladies were in the very last row, also a 4, but ours was still available. I felt a little bit bad about sitting down in front of them, what with them having gotten there early to pick their seats (heh heh, I said pick their seats). I could almost hear their eyes rolling in their heads as we settled in.The Pony had his nose out of joint because Hick dared to sit between us. Everybody knows the child comes between the parents. Besides, it's usually just The Pony and me. We are accomplished adjacent-seat-mates. It's like being one of those Hindu deities with multiple arms. We can juggle two sodas, popcorn, candy, cell phones, glasses, Kindle, mini-spiral-notebook, pen, car keys, Butter Buds, and Kleenex without speaking a word. Hick agreed to switch places when we went out for snacks.We got back just in time for some lackluster previews. The Pony was especially all \"No way!\" about Vampire High. For a moment I thought Divergent looked promising. However, The Pony nixed that one as well. Nor was he impressed by 47 Ronin. Looks like we'll not be padding the pockets of AMC for a while.Our feature presentation was about ten minutes underway when a lady came through the swinging doors. She stood there, jangling her keys. A signal, perhaps, to folks she was meeting. But no. She just stood. Then she came over towards us. Uh uh. Not happening. If she wanted a seat, she was going to have to scale the heights of Val Thevictorian and skootch over next to Hick. Val moves down the row for no latecomer. However...a rumble was not in the cards for me today, my friends. Lady-Come-Lately sat directly behind me. Oh, well. Let her peer through my lovely lady mullet for 2.5 hours minus ten minutes. Then she started jangling those confounded keys again. Like she was trying to make a baby look at the camera. I'm not sure what the other two old ladies thought about being trapped in their row. I couldn't hear they eyes rolling over the sound of those confounded jangling keys.Don't think orbiting oculars and clashing metal were the only barrier to Val's full enjoyment. Our very own Hick made his contribution on the noise pollution front. After The Pony was done with the feedbag, he passed it to Hick. A noisier popcorn eater you'll never hear than Hick. He's one of those people who jam their ham-fisted hands into the bag, smashing all the kernels to confetti, then squeeze a palm-full like making a dry popcorn ball, and crush it onto his face area, herding it into his gaping maw. He sounded like Bigfoot stomping through a swimming pool full of cornflakes. Then The Pony eased into his line of melody, trying to open a cellophane bag inside the Cookie Dough Bites box. It's a good thing the sound was cranked up for our movie.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was the shortest 146-minute movie I've ever seen. The time did not drag. I almost squeezed out a tear at one certain scene. And then it was over! Only a couple of years to wait for the last movie. As the credits were rolling, a voice behind me jolted me out of my reverie.\"You're a much taller lady than I thought.\"HUH? The Lady-Come-Lately dared to comment on the statuesqueness of Val, who was rightfully in her seat BEFORE Lady-Come-Lately came in and picked her seat (heh heh, did it again). Well, I never! The boldness of those Lately folks apparently knows no bounds. And THEN, Lady-Come-Lately had the nerve to place her hand upon my shoulder, lean over, and ask, \"Is that your son?\"No. I just waltzed in here a mere nine minutes after showtime, and sat down by a random stranger. Like you. That's what I wanted to say. But I did not. I'm no common Lately.\"It's me. Lady Lately. Remember, I used to substitute? Where is your oldest boy going to school?\"Dear me. Lady Lately! Of course I remember her. It's just unfortunate that she was standing directly behind me in a dark movie theater. How uncoordinated of me not to see her clearly for recognition. Then I did feel kind of bad. Because I, in my own noncommittal way, harbor no ill will toward Lady Lately. She's a good egg.

And I remembered that Country Mart ran a big ad that they were getting in a shipment of slaw! So I thought maybe you'd found some for me. I can't wait.

Hick flopped down in Mom's recliner and, when she inquired as to whether he was comfortable (!), stated, \"Well, it's a little cool in here.\" Let the record show that the rotating vertical space heater cylindrical gadget was already pointed at Hick, courtesy of the Genius. Mom gave him her blue plaid fleece throw so the delicate hothouse flower would not perish on her watch.There we were, sprawled about, watching a marathon of Alaska: The Last Frontier on The Discovery Channel, when Hick started the pre-sneeze, \"Ahh...ahh...ahh...CHOO!\" At the final CHOO part, he ducked his nose and mouth into Mom's blue plaid fleece throw. Your horror cannot surpass my own.\"What are you doing? That's Mom's blanket! She covers up with that every night while she watches TV!\"\"I didn't hurt it.

Nobody wants to cover up with Hick's used snot. To add insult to the inflicted injury, Hick folded up that blue plaid fleece throw and laid it on the back of the couch. So Mom couldn't even tell which end was infested with Hick's nose cooties.She later reported that as soon as we left, she picked it up with thumb and forefinger, and dropped it by her basement door, so she would remember to take it down and wash it before wrapping up in it again. My sister the ex-mayor's wife saw her grab it, and shouted, \"You're not going to use that without washing it, are you?\"No. Thank goodness, Mom knows proper Hick Cootie Disinfecting Protocol.But we won't end it there. On the way home, I sensed a noxious odor spreading throughout T-Hoe's interior. Hick looked in the rearview mirror. \"PONY!\"The Pony looked up from his laptop. Sighed. \"Seriously?\"\"Stop it. I drive numerous hours with The Pony, and I can report that only about once per month does he have a little gaseous release issue. Whereas you, on the other hand, have one at least every other time I ride with you. That's 50% of the time! Compared to 3% of the time. You know you did it. Stop leaning over. You'd better not do that again. Stop laughing!\"Today I picked up Mom to go for a ride with me on my bill-paying run. The Pony opted to stay at her house and soak up high-speed internet. I filled her in on Hick's on-the-way-home antics. She acknowledged that she used to think I exaggerated a bit about Hick. And even though she got a laugh out of the Horse-Donkey Incident, she was starting to see that maybe my tales were more fact than fiction. As we started down her hill, Mom sneezed.\"Great! Now I'm going to have to wash my car before I can drive it again. Don't try to tell me it's nothing.\" That set Mom to laughing. A lot. So much that I felt the need to add a warning: \"And furthermore, I'll have you know that The Pony is not with us. So if I smell anything, you don't have a scapegoat!\" I can't believe Mom didn't offer me any money this trip. Oh, she reached for her purse when I went to a drive-thru for a Pony lunch treat.

Or so I thought. Turns out I really forked over triple figures to The House of Charlatans Optical Delusions Emporium and Professional Prevaricators Shoppe. Their famous customers include three mice who sport bobbed tails due to an industrial accident with a farmer's wife's carving knife. Mr. Magoo. And Mary Ingalls. Of course I paid for the whole enchilada that day. The exam and two pairs of lenses. I had my distance lenses put in last week. I could see again, after a year of my old prescription never working, and them telling me that as I got older, my eyes didn't adjust quickly, and were probably just tired form working up close all day. Which didn't help me see to drive home with my new distance glasses. But now they are fine. My eyes must have rejuvenated over the year, huh? Or they've been working out, and don't get so tired at the end of the day.Yesterday I went back to have my new bifocals put into my frames. When she called me to the counter, the lady said, \"You're going to feel like a whole new person.\" I sure did. Helen Keller. Because I couldn't see, and nobody acknowledged what I was trying to communicate.\"I can't see!\"\"What?\"\"I can't see with these.\"\"Oh, you'll have to get used to your new prescription.\"\"Well...if you think so.\"\"Here. Please sign that you've received your lenses.\"\"Where? I can't see that. This is not right. It's like I can't see out of my left eye.\" I leaned over the counter. Put my nose nearly on the form. \"Where was I supposed to sign? I can't see it.\" The lady put her finger on a line. I thought I discerned a little squiggly mark that meant 'sign here.' So I did. I guess it looked like my signature.\"If you have any trouble with them, come back and we can adjust them.\"\"Well...I really can't see out of them. I don't think this is going to work.\"\"If you have problems, stop back by and we'll take a look.\"What we had there was a failure to communicate. And a failure to differentiate black squiggly lines on white paper. I took them home. Couldn't see worth a lick. Tried to read a magazine. Had to hold it right in front of my face. At no point could I make out any letters with my left eye bifocal. Not at any distance. I stewed over it all night. Called this morning at 9:05. \"Do you still have my old lenses? I was there yesterday at 4:00 and had new bifocals put in. This isn't going to work. I can't see out of them. I just want my old lenses put back in. I have to be able to see for my job. Right now I'm wearing a pair that's at least two years old. And I can see better than with the new ones.\"The girl said they did not have my old lenses. Seriously? The trash man picked them up between 4:00 and 5:00? Or this morning between 8:30 and 9:05? She said I could come by and they'd take a look. That I probably needed an adjustment. Uh huh. I'm sure the glasses I've had for a year were just suddenly sitting too far down my proboscis.Did I mention that yesterday, while waiting for the technician in the basement to put in my new bifocal lenses, that I overheard two different customers sitting at the frames-picking-out area explaining that they could not see out of their new glasses? Yeah. An old lady, who didn't know what to do, because they were new glasses. And she couldn't see with them. And a guy who had just picked up his new bifocals, who needed them for work, and couldn't see anything. So he wanted to scrap the bifocals and get a pair of glasses just for close up. Because he needed to see at work.Today I walked in at 1:30, and had to wait twenty minutes because...you'll never believe this...a man was already at the counter explaining that he could not see out of the left lens of his new glasses. The lady kept telling him that was very odd. That the prescription was the same as the right lens. It should work. She didn't know what could be the matter. She hemmed and hawed. Then said she could work him in to see the doctor in 30 minutes. Or 2.5 hours. He said his wife and daughter were waiting in the car. So he guessed he'd come back, because he really needed to be able to see out of his new glasses.I heard them whispering about me. Like I was trying to scam them out of new lenses, because I had nothing better to do on this Wednesday before Thanksgiving, enjoying my early out from school by hanging out tormenting the employees of The House of Charlatans Optical Delusions Emporium and Professional Prevaricators Shoppe.The lady came out and apologized for my wait, then started in about how maybe I didn't tell the doctor that I was planning to use those glasses to view my computer screen. No. I told him nothing. I figured my bifocals would work. Like my last bifocals. I did not expect that I would only be able to see directly in front of my face, 12 inches way. I measured it with a ruler at school this morning.She carried on. That she didn't know why I couldn't see out of those bifocals. Tried to make me an appointment on DECEMBER 10, three weeks away! Good thing I have two-year-old glasses I can use to see until then. I asked WHY I was not able to see out of my brand-new bifocals. In my mind, it could only be one of three things:*The doctor gave me the wrong prescription.*The technician put the wrong prescription in the order.*The lens lab received the proper prescription and ground out the wrong prescription.That smoother-over with the job from Not-Heaven assured me that it was the right prescription and the right lenses. She checked it with a machine. Yet still, I couldn't see out of them. Huh. How can it be the right prescription? I asked for a printout of my old and new prescriptions. She went to the back. And brought out the youngest little doctor after ten minutes. He looked at both my old and new pairs of glasses. Had me put them on. Said they only needed to adjust the length on the lenses. So...no appointment.The technician kept my frames! And even worse, she said for me to keep my case. \"Our technicians have a habit of destroying cases. Ha ha.\" Really? So you're taking my frames, and THEY will be safe from those smashing technicians, even though they're not protected by a case?I wash my hands of them! Though I really feel like I want to gouge out my eyes."}, {"title": "The Diet Coke N.A.Z.I.", "date": "Tuesday, November 26, 2013", "text": "This is a short work week. So I've been treating myself to a 44 oz. Diet Coke every evening. Sure, I put in extra ice. I don't exactly have all day to sip this magical elixir.Monday morning, as we climbed into our bespoiled T-Hoe, I told The Pony that I had forgotten to bring a refill cup. I blame Hick. He's off all week, and I'm discombobulated by the disruption of my morning routine. Thank goodness I had such a cup rolling around in T-Hoe's rear, bestowed upon me by my mother in one of our used tabloid/old leftovers/Zyrtec coupon/five dollar exchanges.After school, I carried that cup into the gas station chicken establishment for my refill. I rounded the back aisle and approached the beverage dispenser. Just as I was looking into that cup to make sure no creepy crawlies had made a vacation home, I noticed a flaw. A ripple of sorts. On one side, near the top inside of the stryofoam cup. That was odd. I looked on the outside. No matching curved line. I ran my finger along it. Just an optical illusion. I turned it to observe from a different angle.THAT CUP HAD A CRACK!Yep. That refillable cup would have disgorged its contents before I even returned to T-Hoe. I jammed it in the wastebasket and pulled a new cup out of the wall. At the counter, I made sure to tell the clerk that I had a new cup, not a refill. And the public shaming of Val commenced.This was not the bubbly, friendly-to-every-customer-but-Val clerk who has, of late, improved to treating me as a stick of wood. No. This was the older lady of height, the dark-haired stone-face who talks to herself during each transaction. For example, \"Ten dollars lottery going out, minus ten dollars scratchers, two dollars on PowerBall, and a refill. That's $3.07.\" At first, I thought she was just getting used to the job. Then I figured she was grandstanding for the owner, who is often working the other register alongside her. Then I chalked it up to her having some spectrum issue. Anyhoo...I put a bee in her bonnet.I knew that my 44 oz. Diet Coke would cost more than the $1.07 refill of habit. I thought it was going to be $1.38. In my hand, I clutched a dollar bill and several coins. Stone Face was getting all antsy even before I approached the counter. A dude was scratching scratchers right there on the glass countertop, then cashing in winners for more tickets. Pardon me. That is just not done. Patrons must observe proper convenience-store etiquette. Take your scratching elsewhere, preferably off premises.When I was my turn, Stone Face announced, \"New one? That's one thirty-nine.\" I meant to hand her my dollar, and a quarter, a dime, and a nickel. But I had some pennies in my fist as well. I reached across the counter and dumped the silver coins into her hand, much like Tom Sawyer receiving fence-whitewashing bribes, or Beaver Cleaver counting up coins from Mrs. Mondello's sewing basket that Larry had dumped out the window with plans to say they found the money, which must have fallen out of an airline pilot's pockets.Stone Face was not having it. She was visibly, and audibly, upset. She uttered one word. The S-word. As in, \"IT\" happens. Seriously. You would have thought I asked for bread with my lobster bisque. There was only a lady waiting for chicken, and a dude waiting to pay for gas. Stone Face was not happy with me. ME! Who keeps that establishment afloat! I thought we were kindred spirits. That we enjoyed a curmudgeonly bond. Like persnickety oldsters shaking a fist while being careful to maintain balance by leaning heavily on a cane, snarling through the window, \"You kids get off my lawn!\"Apparently, Stone Face did not feel our bond. She reached across the counter and snatched that one dollar bill out of my fist like a magician whipping a tablecloth out from under a setting of fine china. Ahem. I had forgotten to give her the dollar. I tried to pay for my new 44 oz. Diet Coke with 40 cents.Val stands corrected. Hopefully she is not banned for one year."}, {"title": "Let's Hope Hick Didn't Leave My T-Hoe at Jiffy Park", "date": "Monday, November 25, 2013", "text": "Yesterday, Hick put a stop to the way I roll. Literally. He swiped T-Hoe from the garage, and fitted him with new brakes. Not in the manner of driving T-Hoe to town and paying retail for parts and labor. In the manner of driving T-Hoe to the BARn, cranking him up, digging elbow-deep into his foot innards, and installing brakes he bought at the auto parts store.Hick is good with machines. He's a tinkerer. If there's no part available, he makes one out of scrap metal, saliva, armpit hair, duct tape, and hope. It's not just a hobby. He does the same thing at work. He's a mechanical genius. In fact, back in the days when Hick used to pretend to deer hunt every November, the joke amongst his hunter friends was that Hick's deer stand had a couch and TV and refrigerator and flush toilet. Which of course was not true. Though he did seem to do an inordinate amount of sleeping in the tree limbs. Thus he never shot a deer, but was gifted portions of other hicks' deers, as thanks for fixing their gadgets and procuring butchering accoutrements for them at a good price from his business suppliers.It would seem that putting brakes on T-Hoe was a no-brainer for Hick. A slam-dunk. Easy peasy. A one-hand-tied-behind-the-back cakewalk. Nothing to write home about. Get 'em off, get 'em on, drive T-Hoe back to the garage, and hop on the Gator for a trip down to the creek and a brief respite in the cabin.The sight that greeted me this morning in the garage was not pretty. I opened T-Hoe's door and reached across the driver's seat to set my purse on the console. I sensed right away that something was amiss. The leather seat that has been my domain for 98% of the life of T-Hoe was not at its maximum distance from the steering wheel. Val is a mommy-long-legs. With lengthy orangutan arms. Her setting of \"1\" on the driver's side door moves that seat to the ends of the earth. Or at least into the back seat of T-Hoe. No way could I paper-doll-accordion myself to fit behind the wheel. I pushed the memory button to restore my vehicular furniture to my designated position. All was well. The universe was restored to order. Or was it...The radio was on the SiriusXM 70s station. Odd. I thought I had left it on the old country setting. Hick's preferred ear candy. Oh, well. I clicked past several stations with my steering-wheel finger-button. Some Christmas tunes, perhaps, from Channel 17. Or 4. What's this? I always have my display showing the artist. I know the name of the song. I know the station. What I want to memorize, for future trivia contest purposes, are the singers of the songs. I'll be ding-dang-donged! Now I have to figure out how to put that info back. Fie on electronic gewgaws! So easy to disrupt, so hard to restore.I noticed a skirmish of one in the backseat. \"What are you doing? The heat isn't warm yet! Don't turn it up. You'll freeze.\"\"I'm just putting all my controls back to where they were.\"Verrrrrrry interesting...did the solar flare energy waft through the tiny glass panels at the top of the garage doors, and reset all of our settings? I don't think so. But the other explanation is just as unbelievable. It was like Hick took my T-Hoe to the bowling alley last night when he went to pay for not bowling tonight in order to go to a basketball game, and morphed into jockey Willie Shoemaker chauffeuring Andre the Giant while they lip-synced disco tunes.The brakes work. I don't really want to know what went on in my car."}, {"title": "Hi Ho, Hi Ho, Undermining We Will Go", "date": "Sunday, November 24, 2013", "text": "The temperature has been fluctuating in Backoads this month. Eighty degrees one day, down to 14 a few nights later. Is my intention today to discuss the weather? Of course not.Did I ever mention that 80% of the items that leave Hick's mouth are bunk? Flapdoodle? Self-serving codswallop? Oh, you don't have to take my word for it. I suppose some who don't know me well might assume that I slightly skew my tales to show my own self in the best light, and Hick in a pitch-dark basement corner from which evil vibes and unexplainable shrieks and noxious odors emanate. Inadvertently, of course. Val would never cast aspersions on Hick's character. She's a purveyor of truth.Our home is all-electric. No gas molecule has ever crossed our threshold, unless it bursts forth from Hick's nether regions. Electric stove, electric other appliances, electric heat. As you can imagine, our heating and cooling costs have skyrocketed exponentially over the past few years. Almost doubled. Alas, no longer can I bask in 72-degree coolness throughout the summer, nor toast in 72-degree warmth over the winter. I must roast at 75 degrees over my summer vacation, and shiver at 69 degrees through Christmas break. So I must hold a 44-oz. Diet Coke to my forehead, or drape myself with a fleece-blanket shawl...it still beats paying an electric bill higher than our house payment.Because of my recent frugality, our last electric bill was considerable less than its equivalent this time last year. I take full credit. Pardon me while I shine my unmanicured fingernails on the lapel of my big shirt. That's what happens when you're uncomfortable all the time, and crank down your thermostat even more between 6:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Sure, the house is a bit chilly at 65 degrees when we arrive home from school. But it reaches the magical 69 fairly quickly.You might remember several weeks ago, when I found Hick reclining in his La-Z-Boy, wearing only tighty-whities, while exhaling visible breaths into the 65-degree atmosphere. If memory serves, I chastised him for not preparing a warm house for my arrival. And Hick declared that he was comfortable.Flash forward to Friday night. As The Pony and I rushed inside, mere minutes ahead of the homebound Genius, I lamented, \"The house is going to be so cold!\" The sight that greeted us in the darkening garage was not one of Hick's hanging ghostly jeans, but that of Hick's car. He was home ahead of us. A condition which I needed to get to the bottom of. So intent was I on sniffing out this conspiracy that I did not notice the chill in our abode's atmosphere.Because there wasn't a chill. A fact which I did not realize until five hours later. I accepted Hick's explanation that he had already been home 20 minutes, to prepare for the pre-bowling trip lined up for The Pony, who would miss league on Saturday for the Smartypants Tournament. But there I sat at 10:00 p.m. in my basement recliner, chatting with the bed-bound Pony. \"It doesn't seem all that cold in here. I could get by without my fleece blankie. I bet that thermostat is wrong. Did you notice it when you came back? It's supposed to be on 69, you know.\" The Pony knew. But he had not noticed. Nor did he notice when he went upstairs for a shower. Because when I awoke from an unscheduled chair nap at 3:00 a.m., I found that thermostat set to...72 DEGREES!That's outrageous! I immediately dumped it to 69. But the damage had been done. Ten-and-a-half hours at 72 degrees! I almost needed smelling salts. All that suffering and inconvenience, just so my money-saving plan could be sabotaged. I couldn't wait for Hick to wake up for my inquisition. At 7:00 a.m., Hick removed his breather to answer that he had been cold. So he cranked the heat to 72. Never mind that he was only there for 30 minutes before leaving for the bowling alley. Or that the house must have felt like an orchid sanctuary when he returned. The better to lounge around in tighty-whities, I presume. But here's the outrageous part. Hick's codswallop.\"Well, if you really want to save electricity, stop running that heater under your desk.\"\"I'm so sure that heater has made our electric bill double. I've used it all along. Off and on. To take the chill off. I don't run it every day. I don't run it continuously. I can't believe you think heating a house three extra degrees for ten hours on the coldest night of the year had less effect on the heating bill that my intermittent space heater. I don't think that furnace stopped running all night.\"\"Ha ha. You have no concept of what draws amps.\"\"Don't go making fun of me. I saved money on the electric bill, and now you've already ruined it for next month!\"\"Like I said. That space heater draws a lot more amps. Worry about that instead of the furnace.\"I hate it when he does that. What I wanted to do was tell him that breather he covers with Grandma's quilt every night must be sucking up electricity like a dehydrated hummingbird on the brink of starvation. But I didn't tell him to go without forced oxygen for twelve hours.I swear. To hear Hick tell it, you would think we were actually MAKING electricity for those 10.5 hours at 72 degrees with the outside temperature at 14 bone-chilling digits. Uh huh. I imagine we were selling amps back to the electric company at that very moment, after our long night of overproduction.But it gets worse. Genius, who, during the 99-degree summer, ran his ceiling fan with his western-exposure double-window open during the late afternoon hours, (while using his overhead light, closet light, and desk lamp during daytime), in order to \"cool off\" his bedroom...has taken to declaring that this house is too cold. He wrapped himself in an afghan like a hapless insect cocooned by a spider. Face included. I fear that whileGenius is left home alone this week, he will crank that thermostat and dance through the house like a tighty-whitied Tom Cruise in Risky Business. Even though it means borrowing the tighty-whities.I think he needs to get an apartment so he can make that same amazing discovery about utility bills that he made about grocery shopping. \"Living in the real world is SO expensive!\""}, {"title": "You'd Think the Universe Could Be More Generous With Its Karma", "date": "Saturday, November 23, 2013", "text": "Hmpf! Set out to do something nice, and the universe bites you in the butt.I had to get out early this morning, to take The Pony to his first Smartypants Team event. I called my mom and told her I'd bring the week-old tabloids to her house. We have not been able to make a connection this week. Mom said she was going to town today, so she could meet me halfway. Perhaps at the venue where I was dropping off The Pony. Never let it be said that Val allows her priceless mother to get out at 7:45 a.m. on a Saturday when the temperature hovers around freezing, with a windchill that could penetrate even Val's own thick layer of personal insulation. I told Mom to stay home, that I would come by to drop off the papers. I asked if there was anything I could bring her on my way. Nope. Mom is the woman who has everything, including a pair of gray sweatpants formerly known to the people of Arby's as the gray sweatpants with a hole in the knee.Once my Pony mission was accomplished, I called Mom to tell her I was on the way. I planned to go by McDonald's drive-thru and get a cup of hot chocolate. Did she want something from there? I virtually twisted her arm over the phone. \"I'm going anyway. For hot chocolate. I'll be glad to pick something up for you, too. It won't be an extra stop. I'm getting myself hot chocolate.\" Mom decided that, if it wasn't too much trouble, I could bring her a large Diet Coke. Ptooey! How she can drink that stuff from there I'll never know. It always tasted watered-down to me. Which is still better than the Diet Coke at Dairy Queen, which tastes like a Pine-Sol-like floor-mopping agent has been used to clean the spigots.I pulled up to the McDonald's drive-thru speaker and ordered. One large Diet Coke. One sausage biscuit (because I know Mom likes them, even though I can't stand them because the biscuit is like a giant cotton ball cut in half, wicking moisture from my epithelial cells like there's no tomorrow, giving me cotton mouth with no Diet Coke to re-saturate). And a medium hot chocolate.\"I'm sorry. Actually, our hot chocolate machine is down today. Can I get you anything else?\"No. Nothing else. In fact, if I hadn't already ordered, and if it hadn't been for my mom, I would have said to forget the soda and sausage biscuit as well. What kind of fast-food establishment can't have their hot chocolate machine up and running on a freezing Saturday morning?I pulled to the first window to pay. Then I pulled to the second window to receive a large Diet Coke in a thin plastic cup (no styrofoam, according to a fellow faculty member who was stiffed with flimsy plastic yesterday morning, which sweated through two napkin mop-ups at the lunch table). The lid looked like an elephant had stepped on it, all smooshed in and cracked on one edge. \"Could you please pull to the yellow line? We're waiting on the sausage.\" What kind of fast-food establishment doesn't have sausage ready at 8:00 a.m. on a Saturday?Finally, dragging my stiff neck, chemical burn, extra knuckle, and semi-dislocated shoulder, possessing all the treats for Mom, and no hot chocolate for me, I proceeded on my good-deed tour. The spanking by the universe was well worth the joy I brought to Mom. Week-old tabloids, smooshed watery Diet Coke, and a cotton-mouth biscuit. She's not that hard to please. She even offered to pay me for my trouble.No thank you.

My shoulder was about as mobile as a dislocated joint of the same name. My arm hung limply, like a toddler walking alongside you at the zoo, holding your hand, until he instantaneously decides he's had enough, and magically dissolves all bones in his body.It's not like I tucked that arm up underneath me for safekeeping during my chair nap. Nor like I hung it over the side to attract game fish whilst I cruised the sea of tranquility. Apparently, rest is bad for your joint health.Dang.

I did not accidentally dust Hick's leg lamp to pieces. Nope. I almost severed my ear.Oh, a BB gun is perfectly safe in my hands. I've had one since I was a child. Nobody ever told me I couldn't have a BB gun because I'd shoot my eye out. What I wish I'd been told is: \"You'll comb your ear off, Gal!\" As in a refusal to allow me the use of a hair pick. Those things are deadly.You might wonder why Val even has a hair pick in her bag o' beauty accoutrements. It's all about the LIFT. Hard as it may be to believe, Val's limp old-lady hair needs some impetus to get up off its duff. A gently combing does not even make a blip on Val's hair's radar. Forget a blow dryer. That's just asking for trouble. So Val tempts her tresses, entices those Salvador-Dali-clocklike fronds to puff out their collective chests, rise to the occasion, to stop all that scuttlebutt about Val's hair being applied each morning with a paint roller or magic marker. So seal-like smooth is Val's head that 10 million Vals stuffing 10 million heads in 10 million faculty bathroom sinks could not make one of them catch between the faucet and drain, thus requiring a rescue call by muscular firemen.The hair pick is just the ticket. It adds air. Like a fork beating an egg. Only not so violent. The tine on the end makes the part, then they all join together to whip Val's hair into shape, with only the assist of a round brush to turn the ends under. Oh, stop it! I'm blushing. I know what an attractive hairstyle that is. Don't hate me because I'm beautiful. Hate me because I have two ears. Which was almost not the case this morning.Over her many years of perfecting the morning beautification ritual, Val has grown complacent. Some students have even dared to hypothesize that Val is able to complete her daily coiffure toilette without a mirror. In the dark. So cavalier has she become that every now and then, Val forgets she has two ears. That pick has a bite, my friends. It's like the Cujo of the bathroom counter. One lapse in judgement, a mere millimeter of error, and Val's ear bends like a Chinese acrobat. Thank goodness it clings to her head like a barnacle to the hull of a boat left too long at the mooring. The pain and redness subside over the course of a couple hours.If only my parents had warned me of the dangers of using a pick when I was still in my formative years.

New body parts are possible.Why, just a couple weeks ago scientists discovered a new human body part. Yep. In the knee. A new ligament. Which makes me call shenanigans. How could anybody miss this thing? Seriously. Orthopedic surgeons have been carving on people for years. Do you not think that just one time, during the millions of operations, a particular Dr. Sawbones might have shouted, \"Eureka! I've found the anterolateral ligament!\" Look at it! That thing is as big as a world record nightcrawler. And it's right there beside the famous lateral collateral ligament. How could this have been missed? Somebody call Gray, stat! We need abridged editions of Gray's Anatomy. The book, of course. Not the TV series.But enough about new knee parts to tear and have repaired. Let's get back to Val. No stranger to knee surgeries, having endured two lateral meniscectomies her own self. And on the same knee, no less. Quite a feat.I HAVE A NEW KNUCKLE!It's fairly small, as knuckles go. But it's real. And it's spectacular. All purpley and puffy. Like a California raisin, but without sunglasses, and silent instead of belting out Heard It Through the Grapevine. My 11th Knuckle is on my right hand, between the pinky finger knuckle, and the ring finger knuckle. If it were vocal, it would not be singing. My 11th Knuckle would be cursing a blue streak, lambasting me for daring to interfere with Frig's ice-making organ.I am not a doctor. Nor do I play one on TV. But for some reason, I think I can perform a coldesystectomy on my beloved Frig every couple of weeks. Tonight, it backfired. There I was, jabbing the patient's innards with a butter knife, when I whacked my hand on the unforgiving edge of the organ itself. Twice. The pain was immediate. The swelling and discoloration followed at the speed of a hummingbird's heartbeat. I could not have crushed that cute blue vein any better with a mortar and pestle. Blood cells surged out of that vein and under my skin like third-graders through a push-bar door onto a playground.It smarts. It has a little heartbeat of its own. I call it My 11th Knuckle, but in fact I appear to have only nine now. The pinky and ring kind of ran together, with this purple connector. Of course this buttercup has toughened up in order to bring you the Val news of the day. And this is it.I have an owie."}, {"title": "I Wonder If Sisyphus Noticed Anything Odd About His Task", "date": "Monday, November 18, 2013", "text": "My mom has a thing about leaves. She can't stand to have crunchy autumn leaves in her yard. That would be fine if she had a gardener. A lawn boy. A groundskeeper. But she does not. She is a septuagenarian. And she lives in the woods.Countless times I have told Mom not to worry about the leaves. Countless times she's told me they kill the grass. Grass. One would think Mom lives on the South Lawn of the White House. In the outfield of Fenway Park. On a football pitch frequented by Manchester United. She does not.Mom lives in the woods. The grass of which she speaks is a fringe around the front porch finer than the finest of fine frog hairs. It has to be mowed, in the manner a monk with a fringe of hair must keep it trimmed or look like an unkempt bed ruffle. Must cut those strands of monky hair unless he plans to coil them into some grand bouffant comb-over to protect the middle of his scalp from ultraviolet rays. Removing dead leaves from Mom's yard will not make the canopy spread to allow sunlight to penetrate to the forest floor, thus thickening her fine fringe of grass.The method Mom uses to keep her leaves at bay is to blow them. She rakes them over to the garage area, where the cord of her electric leaf-blower will reach. Then she blows them over to the little creek. Never mind that overnight, Mother Nature and Even Steven join forces to waft those leaves back into Mom's yard. She thinks more are falling off the trees. So she rakes. And blows.Far be it from me to deprive Mom of her favorite fall pastime. I can only advise. I'm just worried that she may break an ankle falling through a mole trail. She's not that concerned about the mole. Oh, she doesn't like him hollowing out her yard underneath those fallen leaves. But she's not gonna go all Bill Murray Caddyshack on him. The spinning metal sunflowers didn't work. Oh, well. Case of rum, case of rum. That's what Kelly Bundy would say.So this morning, on our 6:00 a.m. phone call, Mom said that her Check Mix neighbor had called to see if she was all right after the storm passed through. \"Do you have any leaves in your yard?\" Mom replied that she did not have a single leaf. However, she went on to tell me that for a couple of days, she'd had a big limb that broke off a tree on her property, and was hanging partway on the road. Since that is just a blacktop outer road since the new two-lane highway went in many years ago, there's hardly any traffic except for the livers on that thoroughfare. She was not all that worried about the limb. She had thought of calling for Hick and The Pony to drag it into the yard, but they were at bowling Saturday, and Hick had been gone Friday to Jefferson City.\"Did you know that after the storm, I looked out, and that limb was gone? I walked up the driveway to see, and it was across the road in the ditch! I thought maybe I'd better get it in case there was an accident, but it was off the road, finally. Then I saw my neighbor. That new weird guy. He was walking down his driveway with one of his adult kids. I hollered, 'Hey, did you take my limb?' And he said, 'Yeah. Do you want it back?' And I said, 'Well, I can take it back if it's in your way.' And he said, 'I was going to cut it up to put in my fireplace.' So I said he could have it.\"Yeah. Mom doesn't see that as weird. A guy taking her limb right after a storm, so she'd think it blew across the road. Nor does she see three bags of hedgeapples appearing on her porch as weird. And she certainly doesn't think a septuagenarian blowing leaves from the woods into a dry creek where they can blow right back overnight is weird.But chewing on a sweet dog's nose seems odd to her."}, {"title": "Even Steven and Mother Nature Are Surely in Cahoots", "date": "Sunday, November 17, 2013", "text": "I should have expected it, really. Nobody runs up a tab on Even Steven and gets away with it.The past several days have been the opposite of the crap sandwich I was served a while back. It has been like dining on Beluga caviar spread on toast points laid with gold leaf, sprinkled liberally with white truffle shavings and saffron. Until today.Yes, my life has been chugging along, right on track. We've all benefited lately from Magnanimous Mr. Even Steven. The Pony's ACT results were posted this week, and he achieved a 33 composite score. That's out of a perfect 36, mind you, and puts him right up there in the top 1% of composite ACT scores nationwide. Not too shabby for his first try, and being a lowly sophomore to boot! Hick had a day away from his workplace Friday to attend a meeting in Jefferson City. He was able to squeeze in a visit with Genius on his college campus on the way home. Plus, he scored a coup at the auction last night, with a scantily-clad pin-up girl (as opposed to those pin-up girls who wear Victorian swimsuits) on a Pepsi tray. Sure, it wasn't Coca Cola memorabilia. But it was good enough for Hick. I have no idea where he's going to find room to display it. That might require an addition onto his BARn.What about me, you ask? I had a day off work Friday for the eye doctor, and a lengthy visit with my best old ex-teaching buddy Mabel. And when I stopped for gas station chicken to bring home for supper, the chicken man threw in an extra wing! AND when I took The Pony for his promised fast-food reward after the Walmart shopping today, the girl at the drive-thru window explained that a guy who passed through earlier had left enough money to pay for the man ahead of us, and still have $3.00 left to take off our order! Of course I was grateful. Though The Pony groused that if we had been just one car quicker, our whole $6.50 tab would have been paid. Not like he would ever pay it behind for anybody. We've all learned how he is really not interested in helping people.So, there I was, flying high, all optimistic about my Sunday afternoon, having gotten up early to do that shopping in order to get home before the storm hit. Judging from the clouds, The Pony predicted that it would reach us within ten minutes of our home arrival. He was right. I was warming up my lunch in the oven, and asked him to toss out some old bread to the chickens. He came back reporting that the rain had started. No harm, no foul. I was inside, you see, in my house impervious to rain. Hick was somewhere on the grounds, as evidenced by the unlocked door and the absence of the fleabags who trail him and his Gator like greyhounds after a mechanical rabbit. I placed my lunch on a tray and headed down to my dark basement lair to grab a little internet time. As I set that tray beside New Delly, my desktop, Even Steven stabbed me through the heart.THE POWER WENT OFF!It flickered momentarily to give me false hope, then snapped off like a dad's big toe in a student's story about missing homework. At this moment, it is still off. My power. Not that dad's big toe. Thank goodness we found Hick in the BARn and commanded him to power up the generator. That's how I have internet. But not heat. Or lights. We have to be selective in our ampage. Computer and TV trump lights and heat.With no estimated repair time in sight, I am settling in for a cold, dark evening. Hick immediately jumped into his Gator and took off to find the mitigating factor. Or, as he calls it, the tree that fell across the road and took down the power line. It's not far away. Just down at the bottom of our gravel hill, on the road up past the boys' land. Hick called to give me the transformer number and the pole number. I relayed that info to my brother-in-law the ex-mayor, who works for Ameren. It doesn't move us up the list for repairs, but it saves the crew from driving around looking for that tree needle in our boondocks haystack.I wonder how many hours Even Steven will require until we are square..."}, {"title": "Perhaps This Lady Revealed Too Much", "date": "Saturday, November 16, 2013", "text": "Friday, I had my eyes checked. No, not in a nice madras plaid. I had the windows to my soul inspected. Peered into, shot with a tiny air cannon, and tested for distance with one eye tied behind my back. Or at least blocked by an impermeable barrier.But the best part is...I had a day off work! Yeah. It's not like the optometrist makes house calls. And because my appointment was in the morning, I had the rest of the day to spend with my best old ex-teaching buddy, Mabel. Don't ponder why altruistic Val did not return to work after that medical visit. She tried that one time, and was summarily dismissed. One is encouraged to make use of an entire \"sick\" day, not a half, because substitutes do not like getting dressed and hauling themselves to the education factory for only a few hours. Or something like that.Of course Mabel and I saw the entire world pass by as we nursed our breakfast biscuits for two hours at Hardee's. And by \"entire world,\" I mean people who know us and feel the need to stop by our table to talk, or nod as they're leaving, as if to say, \"We know what you did this morning.\" Let's hope they don't keep appearing in a yellow rain slicker, with a hook arm, trying to scare the bejeebers out of us. Contrary to popular opinion, neither of us played hooky.After catching up on gossip, I offered to take Mabel on a tour of Backroads. Some calls it Hillmomba. I calls it Backroads. Uh huh. Mabel was all for it. I think her mind was still reeling from purchasing her personal Val Thevictorian library. She thinks I'm a genius. Who am I to argue?Anyhoo...we took off in T-Hoe to the far reaches of the county. I could not let Mabel inside my home. This was a spur of the moment offer. I could not expose her to my hoarder house. Not that she would have to climb up on top of six feet of old pizza boxes, adult diapers, mummified cats, and gas station chicken bones to get into the living room. We're just a clutter family. Like three folded towels laying on the couch, a stack of Pisa-esque books on The Pony's end table, a couple of weeks' mail on the kitchen counter. It's not like she would be entering the lair of the Alien where victims (and future meals) were cocooned along the walls.Mabel met my sweet, sweet Juno. And saw the goats and the yard chickens and the turkey and the guineas. She was a bit startled by the scream of the guineas, but then declared she was fascinated by their looks. If only I could box them up and mail them to her. In tiny pieces in order to rid our grounds of them for eternity. They are bullies who grab chickens by their tail feathers and sling them around for sport. Fie on those guineas!Mabel saw all the sights, such as the original 7-year pony, the BARn, the sinkhole, Poolio, Gassy-G the grill, the compound of the guy who threatened to shoot Hick, EmBee the mailbox, the garage cast iron collection, and various other horrors too numerous to mention.I hope she does not suffer from PTSD. After all, Mabel is the wind beneath the wings of my graduation Masters' robe sleeves. We go way back. Maybe some day I'll tell you that story. I hope she is not at this very moment changing her phone number and readying for a move to another county.She thinks I'm a genius, you know."}, {"title": "CAUTION: If Symptoms Persist, See a Doctor", "date": "Friday, November 15, 2013", "text": "Oh. Hello there. You caught me in the act of hanging out my shingle. Yes. I'm nailing it right to the wall of my proposed handbasket factory. I'm a self-certified, old-age, entrepreneurial practitioner. My advice is good for what ails you, as long as what ails you is a sinus headache. I discovered the cure this morning on the way to my eye doctor appointment.Of course Val can't go to an eye doctor appointment without first stopping by her mom's house to drop off the used tabloids from last week. Have you heard? Bill Clinton is still dying, the Queen is still dying, Camilla hates Kate, and Oprah's mom and dad are having some kind of legal battle over an affair. Anyhoo...Mom offered me no money (this is certainly a long dry spell) for my trouble. She did, however, offer me pills when I disclosed my medical status.\"Oh, I hate a sinus headache. Do you need something? A Tylenol? An ibuprofen?\" I turned down Mom's drugs and tried my go-to method of sinus headache relief. I pushed my nose sideways.Don't scoff. It works. Put your thumb and forefinger at the end of your nose bone. Right where the cartilage starts. Right there at the top of the ball of your nose. What? You don't have a nose ball? Then this cure may not be for you. It may not work for the witchy hooks and the Nixon ski-slopes. But it works for the clowny nose-balls. Yeah. Val has a nose-ball. What are you looking at?Take your forefinger off the side of the upper nose-ball, and use your thumb to push it to one side. Sure, your nose-ball will nestle against your cheek. Your nose is out of joint. But it feels so good! The pressure in your sinuses goes away. Then there's that urge to sneeze.This is a warning. Better not try this technique while driving. You can feel that sneeze building. Then it explodes.Atch...HOO! Bend again. Atch...HOO! Blow your nose. Again, engage in nose-ball-bending. Atch...HOO! Atch...HOO! Blow your nose again. Then repeat, using your other hand, pushing your nose-ball the other way.Yeah. That's a sure-fire cure. It's as good as a jar of the Baldwin Sisters' remedy, or anything Granny ever concocted in her cauldron out by the cement pond.Too bad it only lasts until you climb into your T-Hoe and head to the optometrist. When you meet up with your best old ex-teaching buddy Mabel after the appointment, and have a sausage egg biscuit, you can swallow an acetaminophen. Then, ninety minutes later, you can toss back an ibuprofen. By noon-thirty, that sinus headache will be gone.Better jot that down if you want the cure for free. At my proposed handbasket factory, I will be listing a phone number that will cost you $5.00 per minute.

And has been out every time she shops there, which is a couple of times a week. She asked a lady behind the deli counter what was the deal with the slaw, and that lady had no answer, other than to get a look of suspicion on her face, and point out that she could sell Mom some slaw made in the deli, languishing in a bowl in the glass case. Mom turned her down. She knew she could get her slaw elsewhere, in descending order of preferred providers.Mom's back-up slaw vendor is Save A Lot.

Everybody seems to be out.\"\"No, I haven't bought any in a couple of weeks. But I did notice on Saturday that Walmart was out. And they were also out of that red-skin potato salad that we like.

Hick drove T-Hoe back to the Walmart lot to pick up his car to go auctioning. The Pony and I did a rare Saturday-night shop. He almost forgot the two-dollar bribe that I give him for the game room. I guess there were more checkers on duty on a Saturday night, because the lines moved quickly. My gal was ignorant in the ways of bagging like-shaped and like-temperatured items together, but she was fast. I was done before The Pony had finished his first race. I parked my cart beside his machine to watch.\"I still have a dollar left!\" He put it in. Chose his track. Some kind of southern California road, with palm trees and ocean views. It did not help that he reared his red car back in a wheelie at the start, burning rubber and showing off, immediately placing himself in 6th. To paraphrase Rooster Cogburn speaking of his stepson, Horace, who must have broke forty cup...I'll just say that a recklesser driver I've never seen than The Pony. That boy must have destroyed forty light poles. Who knew that a car could drive right through buildings? Though we all know that flowers raining down like...well...rain after a trip through the middle of a roundabout does not portend well for a first-place finish. The Pony was lucky to escape with 3rd, and without a summons. \"All done.\"\"Here's the keys!\" I handed them over under the grimace of a woman who had been sitting in one of those vibrating recliners, watching the race play out. The absurdity of the situation hit me. \"Is this irony?\"The Pony looked sheepish. \"Maybe.\" It's not as if I was giving him the keys to drive T-Hoe. He gets there quicker to click the clicker and start readying T-Hoe's rear to receive our load.That's our routine. He hands me back the keys so they don't get lost, piles in the groceries, covers the cold stuff with my winter coat, and takes back the cart. I get in and write down the debit amount in my checkbook, then give The Pony and myself a squirt of green apple Germ-X that I carry in my purse. Can't be too careful when touching objects the masses have pawed all day.I opened up my driver's door. There, on the black leather seat, was a mark. I don't know what it was. Maybe Hick had some type of chili remnant on his pants, a smashed bean, perhaps, wiped from his man-hands. Maybe he had scooted across the seat like a dog dragging its butt, and a rivet on his jeans left a scratch. I licked my finger and rubbed. I'd like to be able to tell you that the blemish wiped away. But I can't. Because I don't remember.I LICKED MY FINGER THAT HAD JUST BEEN PUSHING A CART THROUGH WALMART FOR 30 MINUTES!It was all I could do not to go Charlie-Brown Lucy, and scream for disinfectant. After all, my lips have touched dog-nose. My tongue, too. So I dialed the horror down a notch. But that didn't keep me from screaming at The Pony, \"I can't believe I just licked my finger that has been on a Walmart cart! I'm going to wake up with hepatitis!\" He chuckled. So supportive. We know he doesn't really have any desire to help people, after that ACT interest inventory. Still. I was shocked at his lack of concern.When we got home, The Pony trotted into the living room to put his phone on the windowsill for an unlimited internet boost. He cradled a package of Jet-Puffed mini-marshmallows like a baby. \"I think I'll have a snack on my marshmallows. Mmm. Smell them. They smell like marshmallows.\" I humored him.\"Yes. What were they supposed to smell like?\"\"I just meant that I haven't opened them yet. And even through the package, they smell like marshmallows.\" He leaned his head over and LICKED THE PLASTIC!\"What are you doing? You know that's been laying around in Walmart, with people pawing at it all day, right? And now, you're LICKING it? I'm going to wake up with hepatitis, and you're going to wake up with hoof-and-mouth disease!\"Sometimes, we do not use good sense.

That's what the poster above the drinking fountain advertised. Chili, and chicken and dumplings. My mom even decided to join us. She was one step ahead, bringing her own containers to get carry-out. For a good cause, you know. To help our basketball teams raise money. Hick got wind of her plan, and told me to take a container to bring home chicken and dumplings. I can't make them. Only the quick kind with cream of chicken soup and tortillas.We all drove separately. Except The Pony, of course. That would have been illegal. And ill-conceived. Hick planned to drop by the auction later in the evening, so we picked him up on the Walmart parking lot for the trip to school. After the games, The Pony and I could do our shopping before heading home, and Hick could go on to the auction.During the intra-squad games, Hick decided he was going to grab a bite of supper. He headed for the cafeteria for some chicken and dumplings. I swear he was salivating. Mom kept an eye on him. She wanted a piece of that chicken and dumpling pie.Hick returned to our seats at the rail, overlooking the gym floor. \"There's no chicken and dumplings.\"\"What? Did you eat it all?\"\"No. They didn't have it.\"\"But the signs said chicken and dumplings!\"\"Well, nobody at the counter seemed to know anything about it. I had chili. And it was spicy.

You said there'd be chicken and dumplings!\"\"I know. That's what the signs said. I can't believe there's no chicken and dumplings! Will you still want chili? Hick says it's spicy. I know you don't like spicy things.\"\"Well, I brought my containers. I was looking forward to chicken and dumplings. I guess I'll still get some chili. I was going to eat chicken and dumplings tonight and tomorrow.\"\"If you put in a lot of crackers, and maybe a dash of sugar, and sprinkle in some shredded cheddar...I think it will be bland enough for you.\"Mom nodded. She hadn't brought in containers for nothing, by cracky! She dug through her purse and handed Hick a bag of sugar-free Starlight Mints. \"Do you need a Tums? I have one in my purse. Wait! No. I took it out.\"Hick stopped giving himself the gently Heimlich. \"Those mints will be okay. I don't need a Tums.\" He stuffed several in his pocket, and handed back the bag. My mom does not eat sugar-free mints. She brings them for Hick. Ever since that time she gave him butterscotch and I asked if she was trying to kill him. They bandied words over the Starlights, and Hick ended up stuffing the whole bag in his pocket. For the car. Mom and The Pony headed to my classroom to grab her containers. Hick had reported the chili price as $3.00 per bowl. Mom wanted to buy $4.00 worth. She asked for a dipper and a third.

That means I drove through when the light was on red. Just in case there was any doubt. It was a deliberate, premeditated act. I was not apprehended. I was not even chased. Though I cannot say I was without witnesses. And accomplices.My life of crime began around 6:50 a.m. The Pony and I had just entered the Backroads city limits. I reined in T-Hoe to a respectable 30 mph. Just like the sign commanded. Also, that section passes by the mini-mall that used to house the police department. Two school buses pulled out from a side street and beat me to the traffic light. There were a couple of other vehicles already waiting. As I neared the intersection, the last bus went through. But I had a red light. So I stopped. I was not yet a criminal.The line to my left got its turn. They had just come off the highway exit. I imagine some were heading to the drive-thru liquor store that seems to do a good business every morning. There was no line to my right, because that's the on ramp that heads up to the highway. The oncoming cars got their turn next. A few made lefts with their arrow, crossing in front of me to reach their highway access. Others came straight through. Then their light turned red. I know that, because they all stopped. It was now my line's turn. OR WAS IT?The line to my left got the green arrow again! I could see it, and they again proceeded from their highway exit ramp toward the drive-thru liquor store area. WHEN WAS MY TURN? I had waited at least two whole minutes. And that's not even a two-minute light. More like 30 seconds. Again, the oncoming line had their turn. Stopped. Nobody was moving. There were no cars in the oncoming left turn lane.I DROVE THROUGH THE RED LIGHT!Fair is fair. My line was skipped on two turns. Traffic was piling up behind me. It happened a few weeks ago coming from the other direction, with a left-turn arrow. Cars honked, and veered into a parking lot to cut through the light. I was in no mood for that this morning. I took my chances. Funny how the line of traffic behind me followed like I was some Pied Piper of Poor Driving Skills. The next two lights worked. Meaning that they were green, and I drove right through them. The better to make my getaway. It also helped that another school bus was directly behind me, defending my rear flank. I almost had me a convoy, rollin' through the morning, though short of 11 long-haired friends of Jesus in a chartreuse microbus.After weaving up the side street by the funeral home, and down in front of the dead-mouse-smelling post office, and up the wide rich-house street to go past the lake...I was pretty much in the clear. I narrowly avoided a long rock-hauler and a reckless dump truck rounding a bridge curve near the shooting range at 50 mph instead of the intermittently-enforced 20 mph. That extra time at the red light might have been a deciding factor to avoiding smashage. Anyhoo...as I came out to the main road by the bank that shorts my mom $10 and won't cash her dividend check, I saw by their clock that I was exactly two minutes behind schedule.Good thing I broke the law. Today was my duty day. It doesn't pay to be late on duty day. A call goes over the intercom, in the principal's voice: \"I AM ON DUTY IN THE (parking lot/cafeteria/gym/hall) BECAUSE THE TEACHER WHO IS SCHEDULED IS NOT.\" Which is a signal for all the teachers to grab their handbooks and look up whose turn it is.

Hick is Public Enemy #1.This month, the local news has shown a guy caught on surveillance cameras, robbing church collection boxes. Mom chose a more populated target.\"Oh, my. I have to tell you this. I went to Walmart this morning to pick up a few things. When I got outside, I saw a can of nuts rolling around. What? In the cart. It wasn't in a bag. So I wondered, did I put that there? Was it already in the cart when I started pushing it? I had nuts on my list. I'm making Check Mix for the church bazaar. I sent Genius a letter about the bazaar, but I think I spelled it wrong, with two Zs. He's probably laughing at me. What? Oh. So all my other groceries were in the bags. I wondered if the nuts might have rolled out as I pushed the cart. I got in the car with the nuts, and checked my receipt. Would you believe that the nuts were not on the receipt? So then I started to worry. What if they saw me leave without paying? I don't remember putting the nuts on the conveyor. The girl came around to scan some soda that I had in my cart. But she didn't scan the nuts. IF they were mine. She should have seen them in there. What? Uh huh. I wanted the nuts. So I got to thinking, that girl might get in trouble if her register was short. I took that can of nuts and walked back in. Not in a bag or anything. Just in my hands. And I went over to that girl, and explained that I found them in my cart when I got to the car, but they were not on the receipt, so I was bringing them back in to pay for them. And do you know what that girl said? 'WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TAKE THEM?' Can you believe that? I told her no, that I was not that kind of person, and I could not just take them. I didn't pay for them. I told her she would probably see me now every time I came in, and hope that I didn't come through her line.\"\"Well, she SHOULD be hoping that she doesn't see you in the store, telling everyone that story, and that all those people rush to her line hoping to get something free.\"\"Oh, you're terrible. I have not had a very good day. I went to the bank to put in my dividend check, and all they sent back through the canister was a slip of paper. So I pushed that call button and said, 'I wanted to cash that check, and all I got was a piece of paper. I'm waiting for my cash.' And do you know what they told me? They can't cash that check. So I said, 'You've been cashing it for nine years now. I don't know why you can't cash it today.' So the girl left for a while, and when she finally came back she said that they could give me my money today, because So-and-So had signed for me. There is no need for anyone to sign for me! That is my dividend check!\"\"Was that the same girl who shorted you $10 that time you deposited a check and wanted cash back?\"\"Yes! I don't even think she got into any trouble for that. She's still working there.\"\"I hope she's not scamming old people. I think that next time, I would go inside if I was you, and make sure I didn't get that girl to wait on me.\"\"I KNOW!

It was an honest mistake. Really. Not like I was trying to cover up a crime. Give the alleged perpetrator the benefit of the doubt. Nope. I simply forgot. Actually, I forgot two tiny details.As The Pony and I came up the driveway with the groceries jostling in the carpeted rear of T-Hoe, we saw that Hick's oldest son, a regular adult, was visiting with him on the brick sidewalk between the garage and the house. Juno scampered hither and yon, unable to decide whether to greet us and the groceries, or revel in the attention of the once-a-week visitor.Of course she chose me. It had nothing to do with the bags of foodstuffs. Of that I am sure. Juno does not bother the provisions. That's just a rumor started by Hick, perpetuated by The Pony. For no good reason other than to smear Juno's stellar reputation. Green-eyed jealousy will make both man and beast discredit another for their own benefit.The Pony ran inside with his laptop and other precious traveling possessions. As I was getting the bags out of the back hatch to set on the side porch for The Pony's return, I heard Hick raising a ruckus.\"Juno! Get back here! Give me my glove!\"At no time did I see Juno with a glove. All I could see through the garage door was her shiny black twisting rumpus and feathery swinging tail. She squirms like that when she wants attention. As I came out onto the sidewalk, I said, \"There you go, blaming my dog again.\"\"She had my glove! It's the last one left. I guess she ran off with the other one yesterday!\"\"Oh, sure. Like she wants your glove.\"\"I just pried it out of her mouth!\"\"I didn't see that.\" Heh, heh. You've got to get up pretty early in the morning and shove a couple of dozen brown jersey work gloves in Juno's mouth and take a picture of it to fool me. Criminy! You can get those gloves for $0.09888888 apiece! It's not like this special pup stole the Hope Diamond.I set down the first batch of bags and went back for more. The Pony snatched them up and took them inside. The next load included cold foods. A long Walmart deli sandwich stuck out of one plastic sack. Juno was trying to get to me for our lovefest. It just so happens that her tasty, rubbery black nose inadvertently landed upon the cellophane wrapper of that sandwich where it stuck out of the bag. An accident. I'm sure.\"Juno! Get your nose out of the groceries!\" The Pony had a smirk on his face. He was taunting me. I'm sure. He's such a trickster.\"She was only coming to me. See there? What a sweet girl you are, Juno!\" Let the record show that I spoke in a clipped manner, and kept my jaw partially locked in order to maintain a minimal mouth opening. My doubters rolled their collective eyes.I did not feel that it was the right time to compliment Juno on her silky shiny coat. I'm sure it cannot be attributed to anything supplementing her diet while we are away from home for ten hours a day. No. My sweet, sweet Juno did not need validation for her healthy fur.Somebody might have gotten the wrong idea."}, {"title": "If You Can't Hang With the Mean Cats, Stay On the Porch", "date": "Sunday, November 3, 2013", "text": "The Great Porch Board Replacement Project continued today.Hick donned a glowing orange hooded sweatshirt and commenced to prying with the temperature hovering around 37 degrees this morning. The Pony enjoyed a brief reprieve while assisting me with a beans-and-ham delivery to my mom, a T-Hoe gassing, and the weekly grocery shopping. I know he did not mind waiting until the weather warmed up. Yesterday he was all decked out in camouflage pants, orange-and-gray shoes, white socks, a red-and-white striped shirt, a navy blue hoodie with tan fleece lining, and beige women's Isotoner gloves. No. It was not his Halloween costume.All night I worried that the animals would plunge to their respective tragic, sad, unfortunate, untimely, unnoticed, just-deserved, and long-awaited demises. Juno was my prime concern. She's a flighty girl, gallivanting to and fro with abandon. Ann the black shepherd is just plain not-smart. She's always anxious, so I figured she would roll the whites of her muddy brown eyes and give that hole a wide berth. Tank the beagle has intermittent, mysterious back problems, and has been observed walking on two legs. That's right. TWO legs. I refused to believe Hick, then I saw it for myself. Opposite corners. He could run better than he could walk. However, he's been in some kind of four-legged remission for months, so I was pretty sure he would not topple down below.The cats are another story. Genius the orange tabby, the brains of the outfit, has previously returned after a month-long disappearance, cheats death daily by getting under Hick's feet, and appears to have many lives left. Dusty the crumpled-eared gray tortoiseshell comes and goes, mostly avoiding people unless she wants that nasty ear scratched. She might have slipped through the giant crack. Simba the tan tabby is too evil to succumb to a mere hole in the floor, so I figured I would see him live to taunt the likeable pets another day. But that black-and-white tuxedo cat, Stockings, who weighs about 40 pounds and avoids us like the plague, only using us to supply him with $80 worth of generic Meow Mix every month, was not on my worry list.Those cats are all virtually indestructible. They run along the rail overlooking the ten-foot drop as insouciantly as if they were running across a cheese field riddled with mice. Every now and then, one puts a foot wrong and disappears momentarily over the side, only to pop his head up over the edge and drag himself purposefully back like that metal T-1000 man with the hook arms in Terminator 2 piercing the trunk of the car John Connor was in, pulling himself right up on it.Our flying felines can't wait for me to pull T-Hoe into the garage. Hick's hanging ghost pants be darned! These cats hop onto T-Hoe's rubber bumper, onto the slick, slick black hood, up the windshield, onto the roof, up onto the open garage door, into the rafters, and weave through that elevated maze like Ms. PacMan without the noise. You might wonder how they gain purchase on T-Hoe's smooth slanted metal. CLAWS! I have a feeling the insurance company will not believe those marks were an act of nature.Upon my last project inspection, all boards were in place, save the one directly under the rail. It remains rotten.

They're only fifteen years old. According to Hick, they should not have rotted. It's due to his homebuilding carpenter not leaving a gap between the boards like he should have. A pencil-width would suffice, according to Hick. Except that suffice part. Hick would never use a word like suffice.This is the part of the porch that veers around to the right side of the picture, past the kitchen nook sticky-outy part, that is not under roof. The porch, not the kitchen. What kind of kitchen would that be, without a roof? Not Val's kind of kitchen. She needs a proper kitchen, to use for warming things in the oven, or heating them in the microwave.Hick and his apprentice, The Pony, spent all afternoon prying up boards, tossing them over the brink, and screwing down new planks. According to Hick, the nonexistent cracks of the rotten boards were \"...full of cat hair and dog hair. The water couldn't seep through. So they rotted.\" By tomorrow, I'm sure my sweet, sweet Juno will be the sole fur purveyor for all boards rotten.I hope the animals have good night vision. The cats are wont to hop up on the porch rail and tightrope walk while taunting the dogs. The dogs take a shortcut from the house of Juno by the kitchen door around to their food dishes on the other side. I'm sure they will be leery of the opening. That's about a ten-foot drop.The internet was slow today, my friends. Slow. Like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli. Oh, wait. That's the angry sea. Not the slow internet.

I need to take her up the road a piece, to the guy who has sheep. Then she'd be happy. Can't say the same for the sheep.Yesterday afternoon I stopped to give her some extra loving care. Perhaps she simply feels neglected. It had rained most of the day, so she was probably cooped up on the porch. All three dogs ran to the side porch for some Val love. Of course I spent most of my time with Juno. Ann the black german shepherd is not all that bright. A quick pat and the mention of her name is enough to satisfy her, even though Juno feels the need to thrust herself between us for my undivided attention. Even Tank the beagle strolled over for a pat. I worry about him. He gets too near the edge, and Juno is quick to bump him off, which would not bode well for his stocky physique. I usually can act as a cushion to keep him topside.So yesterday I was hugging Juno, letting my hand extend over her back to pat pat pat the head of Tank or Ann. Juno commenced to squirming like a red wiggler being impaled on a barbed J-hook. She was all feisty with pent-up energy. I always talk to her during our lovefests. \"Now, Juno...you know there's plenty of Val's love to go arou--\"I'LL BE DING DANG DONGED IF IT DIDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN!Juno did not just feint toward my oral cavity.

Five miles from town. Out in the sticks. On a road that's not even a blue highway on a state road map. Dog walkers. I immediately sensed their foreignness. Definitely not Backroads dwellers. They had to be city folks, out for a Sunday drive in no-man's land. Roughing it. On an adventure with their four-legged friends. The signs were all there.First was the big sign. The sign nailed up on a tree ten feet into our gravel road. \"Private Property. No Trespassing.\" Parking one's truck on the edge of the gravel road past that sign kind of counts as trespassing, you know. That's why we used to have a big metal gate with a chain and a padlock, until too many people actually built homes on their property and didn't want to get out and unlock it. The free part of the road is the blacktop, by the bridge, by the creek. Nobody can own a creek. Your dogs can pee to their heart's content in the creek, or along the blacktop right-of-way.The second sign was the truck. It almost fooled me. A pickup truck, by cracky! Then I noticed the color-coordinated, locking bed cover. No. We don't normally have those. They don't fit right with a toolbox mounted against the cab. And it's hard to haul stuff under a cover.The coats on the man and woman were a clue. Coats! At only 54 degrees! Who wears a coat in such balmy weather? Not Backroadsians. And not in such bright neon green. That color is for road workers. Besides, a Backroadsian will still be wearing his wife-beater sleeveless ribbed white t-shirt at 54 degrees. If the temperature drops below freezing, he might throw a flannel shirt over it. Below zero, it's a sandstone-colored Carhartt cotton-duck jacket.And another thing. Backroadsians do not run around with their women. Guys hang out with other guys in their pickup trucks. The gals stay at home. Man and woman together in the woods on a Sunday afternoon? Not in these parts. The dogs themselves were out of their element. So excited! Two big black ones, and a brown one. I didn't get a good look at the breed, though I'm sure they were not simply mutts. They were so hyped up that two tried to run out in front of me. Perhaps to shove their snouts in my mouth for a good chewing, or because they were so over-stimulated by the country aromas wafting on the wind. Thank goodness the doggies were safe, because they were on leashes!Major clue! Backroadsians don't take their dogs anywhere on leashes. And they most certainly don't have the leashes hooked to nice harnesses that fit each dog like a tailor-made suit. Backroadsians lower the tailgate of the coverless pickup bed of their truck, give a whistle, and Fido and Rover hop in for a ride. They pace side to side, sniffing the air as they fly down the highway. If the Backroadsian makes a stop at a gas station or Walmart, the dog stays with the truck. It would never enter Fido's mind to hop out and run off after a scent. He jumps up on the metal toolbox and barks as people walk by. He's protecting his truck.I didn't witness it from this particular couple, but I've seen it at the front-lawn dog toilet that locals call The Dairy Queen. The method of rehydrating the canines. Nobody around here carries a collapsible water bowl, into which they pour bottled water. Backroadsians motion for the dog to jump down from the truck, where it will drink from a muddy puddle.Yeah. We know you're not from here.

So I was pleasantly surprised to read in the calendar of upcoming events that he was signing his futuristic historical novel.

The Pony and I parked T-Hoe in the lot, and proceeded to seek entrance. The first door had a sign that directed us to the front. So did the second door. We walked about 270 degrees (for all the math teachers) around that venue when we could have parked on the street right by the door. As I went by the main desk, I waved my copy of the paperback, which I had ordered from Amazon, unaware of this signing.I saw my old classmate seated at a wooden table, talking to three people. Good. I wasn't the only one to show up. I moved closer, and waited a polite distance of three giant steps, or ten baby steps. Close enough so people could see that I was next, and far enough not to interrupt their interaction. It didn't take long to figure out that these three people were in the same family, and buying one copy of the book.Let the record show that Val is not a snob. She worked in an insurance salvage store, by cracky! She doesn't put on airs. She wears Crocs! But I must share with you the absurdity of my signing experience.This is Backroads. People here are not privy to the ways of book signings. In fact, they would snicker if anyone said the word privy out loud. It has another meaning here. These are my people. Good to the bone. Mostly honest, and hardworking. The country was build upon their backs. In fact, it put some of their backs on disability. But they are generous to a fault. Impressed with a local author. Just not all that well-versed in book-signing etiquette.The three musketeers lingered. They saw this event more as a family reunion, with their adopted author. I won't go into detail on their appearance. Let's just say that if this post was all about them, I would have titled it \"The Three People You Take Pictures of in Walmart.\" It was a mom, a dad, and an adult son. The kind you know lives in the basement and plays computer games all day. WAIT A MINUTE! THAT DESCRIBES MY SON! Except for the adult part.Anyway, these three went on and on about old times. I gathered that they were once neighbors, or the son had been a student of the author at one time. They asked if Author was still teaching. Really? His picture wasn't in the yearbook. Not even under \"Playing Hooky,\" or \"Not Picutured.\" They acted like he was lying to them.Author was trying to wrap it up. \"I guess I should just sign this to 'The Walmart Family.' Or do you want someone's name in it?\" They agreed, and the son proclaimed that HE was reading it first. Author nodded to me. \"Where did you get THAT? I'm the only one that has paperbacks.\" He was surprised I got it from Amazon in three days. Apparently it's a print-on-demand book.The Walmart Family was having none of that. They drew the attention back to themselves. \"Come by and visit with us. If the silver van's not there, the red van should be there.\" I learned that they had not been able to find the library. That they had to ask the police for directions. And that Walmart Jr. had just had a tooth pulled, and had gone through two knee surgeries. In addition, the Walmart Family home had been struck by lightning, which destroyed their stove and refrigerator and several other major appliances.I know they were there before I was. And had as much right to have a book signed as I did. Maybe more, because they bought it directly out of Author's cardboard box. But seriously. They were taking my rightful place as a former classmate of Author! I wanted some face time. Mother Teresa herself could have raised my ire if she was all peaceful and patient and stepped in front of me to have her book signed. Because who has the nerve to be dead and cut in line at a book signing? I don't care who you are.After 20 minutes of standing, listening to the Walmart Family drone on about themselves, my attention started to wander. I noticed a woman furtively peeping out from the shelves in the area that long ago housed my unemployment office cubicle. She exuded the attitude of Kathy Bates just before hammering James Caan's legs to put him in Misery. I glanced at some paperback shelves. Kathy Bates kept popping up in various locations like Waldo. Finally she plopped down in an overstuffed faux-leather chair near The Pony, no doubt contemplating the best moment to bring in the sledgehammers in her trunk. I wondered if she'd been there before me, and had slunk off when exasperated by the Walmart Family. Oh, well. Too bad, so sad. I held the title to the prime piece of next-in-line real estate now. Which reminded me, I needed to step back over there.Just in the nick of time, too. There was a new gal in town. Who might have been a body double for Lulu in To Sir, With Love, had she been born several decades earlier. I gave her the stink-eye and rushed back to my rightful on-deck spot. Unfortunately, she was either a close-non-talker, a stalker, or one who has no concept of personal space. Blondie was in my hip pocket. Heck, she could have been in my hip-replacement, so close was she. With each inhalation, I virtually committed assault.The Walmart Family ran out of sad-sack tales, and bid their adieu. I was dying to sit down across the table from Author for a little tete-a-tete. But Blondie surged forward with me. I feared that she would ensconce herself on my lap (oh, who are we kidding, Val has no lap) so as to insinuate herself between me and author. Alas, our chat was brief. Turns out Author knows Hick! He lived next door to Hick's first girlfriend way back in high school, though Hick was a few years ahead of us both, and went to a different school.Author complained that the Backroads internet rag had run his Local Author article a week AFTER a previous book signing. Now they were not on speaking terms, and were even chilly to his liaison. He did, however, write out his number on an index card in case we ever want to do business together. That's all he had time for, what with Blondie giving him meaningful looks, butting in, saying \"Hi\" while it was still my turn.I felt sorry for Miserable Kathy Bates."}, {"title": "A Wanton Disregard For Hygiene", "date": "Saturday, October 26, 2013", "text": "I confess. I've been holding out on you. There has been a slight update on the dog-nose-chewing incident. I can't imagine why I didn't want to revisit that moment in time. My mom sure likes to reminisce about it. She starts laughing like Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman, Lyle Waggoner, Vicki Lawrence, and Tim Conway in the middle of an Old Man sketch. Like Ricky Ricardo when Lucy is foiled in one of her outrageous attempts to outsmart him. Like Roseanne in the opening credits of her first season.Two weeks ago, when The Pony and I were carrying in groceries, Juno came to greet me. Ever since my taste of canine snout, I've been cautious. I still engage in our lovefests, but I'm wary. On high alert to avert my head should my sweet, sweet Juno fling her muzzle towards my pie-hole. She mostly behaves. But every now and then, Juno rears her silky head. You know how it goes. B.F. Skinner found out that a behavior will continue, even if only rewarded one out of ten times. No extinction for my Juno's nose-jabbing. She got a taste of me getting a taste of her snoot, and now she wants more.It did not help matters that she ran to the grocery bags I plopped on the porch and took a quick sniff. Thus causing The Pony to crow that, indeed, \"Juno DOES get into the groceries. Just like Dad said.\" Poppycock! She is just inquisitive, that's all. Maybe a missing person touched one of those grocery items while loading a freight truck, and Juno is on her way to becoming a famous rescue mutt. At no time did she insert that tasty nose of hers into the bags.So there we were, after the novelty of the missing person wore off, Juno and me, lovin' it up. Then all at once, my sweet, sweet Juno forsook me for another. She took two steps across the side porch toward the garage door. To the cat we don't like very much, Dusty, with the crinkled ear, who was arching her back, rubbing against the cedar siding of the garage wall, indicating that she would very much like me to open that door back up so she could run in and consume some stale food that Juno had not gotten to yet. Allegedly.Juno's mission was not to poke Dusty with her sharp, herding (yet delicious) nose, thus eliciting a playfight. Nor was it to run Dusty off so the spotlight would be on herself. Nope. Juno just had to step over and insert her pre-chewed nose directly into the inviting feline anus of that darn cat. Not simply a polite little sniff. Inserted. Like a proctologist without a glove. She was two nostrils deep in that puckered orifice. I blame Dusty. She didn't have to raise her tail like an exclamation point, now did she? Like the two of them don't have all the live-long day to play Who Sniffed Your Anus?Just as quickly as she was gone, Juno returned to my loving arms. Raised her quivering snout toward my face. My mouth clamped shut tighter than Jerry Seinfeld's when his date Audrey offered him a piece of Poppie's pizza.The horror just got real."}, {"title": "The Universe Conspires to Mock Me", "date": "Friday, October 25, 2013", "text": "You know how occasionally you deliberately or accidentally send a wish out there, and in a few days it comes back? Sometimes that's not really a good thing.Oh, every now and then, it's nice. Like only yesterday on the way to school, I complained to The Pony about a song we hadn't heard on our SiriusXM Prime Country music station. \"Hey. We haven't heard Private Andrew Malone in several months. I'd really like to hear that one again. Genius always liked it, too.\" And wouldn't you know it, when I took my mom for a ride to pay the bills today, that very song came on the radio. I heard it in its entirety. Mom even held her tongue and didn't interrupt. I just looked it up, and the actual title is Riding With Private Malone, by David Ball. If you're a country hater, don't listen. Keep on hatin'. It's a free country.Then there are the times a thought goes out into the universe, and you don't really want it to come back. It's like Gage in Pet Sematary. Best forgotten. Try to move on. Of course I'm leading up to a prime example.Last night, during commercials in the World Series broadcast, I grabbed one of the multitude of junk mail catalogs that EmBee the green wide-mouthed mailbox stuffs herself with, which I peruse in order to cut out odd items and mail to Genius. This one happened to be from Signals. Not that I've ever bought anything from it. Most items are just not my style. And expensive, to boot! But sometimes they're funny. Or unusual.There it was, in the top right-hand corner. A picture of an item I did not recognize. What in tarnation IS that thing? I looked closer. Some kind of pendant.Then I read the description. Personalized Dog Nose Charm. Yeah. THE HORROR! Make it stop! Seems like only yesterday I wrote of my unfortunate oral violation by my canine's proboscis. Surely you remember it. I Might Be Changing the Name of My Garage Band From \"Mommy's Got a Headache\" to \"Other Dogs' Anuses.\" Yeah. I had to put in that plug. Because I really like the title. Not because I want to relive that nightmare. My mom still goes into hysterics when SHE brings it up.Now this. Who in their right mind wants to wear a charm of their dog's nose? And pay upwards of $149 for it? I imagine it costs more if the dog is, say, a Great Pyrenees, as opposed to a chihuahua. Perhaps it's the difference in hefty medallions or dainty charms. Or maybe you can get them in pewter, white gold, or 14k. I don't know. Because I couldn't read any further than the method of procuring Fido's snootprint. Apparently, you order a kit that you use to slap some kind of mold over your beloved pet's nasal cavities. You know. The ones they need to draw breath and remain alive. Then you mail that back to get your charm.Even more scary is the proclamation: In Stock and Ready to Ship. What? How can they already have my dog's nose in stock? That's just wrong. Is there some kind of database of dog's noses? Maybe that's why my fleabags bark their fool heads off between 4:00 and 7:00 a.m. every day. The dog-nosers are after them. For the database.

The Pony will be taking the ACT that day. Yesterday morning, and again after school, and just before my mom picked up The Pony for the bowling alley destination, I told him, \"When you get home, you or Dad will need to turn up the thermostat.\" Three times. The charm.I drove home in the cold and dark. Pulled T-Hoe into the garage. Thanked The Pony, who trotted out to carry in my things. Patted my sweet, sweet dog Juno, who greeted me like I was Inman returning to Cold Mountain after an eternity traipsing the sub-Mason-Dixon Line countryside.I walked into my happy home to find the ambiance much like that of the ice hotel I saw on The Travel Channel. Without the vodka. As soon as my eyeballs unfogged, I saw that the thermostat was cooling its bi-metallic-strip heels at 66 degrees. A temperature fit for neither Val nor beast.

A battle of wills to which there is no easy solution. There will be no winner. Even the winner will be a loser. In times like these, I find it best to keep one's opinions to oneself.Perhaps I've mentioned that I live on a gravel road. How presumptuous of me. How totally lacking in foresight was I. That's a statement. Not a question. Not even a rhetorical inquiry. Pardon me while I set the record straight. I live on a dirt road.Oh, it USED to be a gravel road. Perhaps you can still see the gravel in the photo. That happens to be a portion of the $1500 worth of gravel kindly purchased from the not-so-deep pockets of one individual. Who asked nothing in return. Who hopped on his tractor and bladed the road while the rest of us were at work. Leaving a rocky surface that defied standing water and mudflinging. Sure, the ride was a bit rough. A smaller grade of gravel might have been more appropriate. But still. FREE GRAVEL. And free labor spreading it out.That magnificent mile lasted about three weeks. Then another dweller took matters into his own wheels. Tired of tirelessly complaining about the rough ride, and how slow he had to drive on the last portion of his homeward commute, AntiRocky threw down the gauntlet. He tractored-up and reapportioned that $1500 worth of gravel to the sidelines. The place where it eventually ends up anyway, needing to be bladed back to the center.The rain at the end of last week made this section a muddy mess. Did you know that big ol' groovy tires like those on T-Hoe, tires common to those on similar vehicles that make this trek at least twice per day, fling bits of the roadway onto the sides of the vehicles? They do. Carrying away the road small portions at a time.On Wednesday I passed a local on his tractor, spreading the wealth back into the mainstream for all to enjoy. He looked engrossed in his mission, and barely returned my country-folk wave. As I rounded this bend to the right, then the next to the left, I came upon another denizen on HIS tractor. His wife sat in a Gator, their dog ranging to and fro. THIS neighbor was using his blade to shove the gravel back to the sidelines. I almost though I saw steam coming out his nostrils. He also barely returned my country-folk wave. I had to wave at both, you see, because I don't want them to know which side I'm on. The Rockies or the Dirties.The stony benefactor is the guy who threatened to shoot Hick one evening, and mouthed off to the resulting county deputy, and cost himself $6000 in lawyer fees to remain a free man.

Hick is a collector of all things Coca Cola. Or nearly Coca Cola. This one is not associated with the brand, but it IS in Coca Cola colors, and will fit in with his BARn loft decor, and might possible fool somebody who's not a Coca Cola collector into thinking it belongs.Okay. So it doesn't fit in so much with the decor of the BAR part of the BARn. It fits in with the Coke booth on the opposite side of the loft. However, Hick chose to plop it on top of the family crest on the BAR proper, probably to show off as much of his junk treasure as humanly possible. I will admit that he sent me a picture from a slightly different angle, which I deleted because it showed that last inappropriate item that he bought himself. The one that The Pony called a \"drink dispenser.\" For a moment I did not recognize it in the background. I glanced, and assumed it to be one of those old-timey stand-up telephones with the tall body and cone-shaped earpiece on a wire.

Don't you just love to get mystery packages in the mail? Like when you haven't ordered anything? And you can't tell what it is, even by squeezing? Yeah. ME TOO!I believe I've described EmBee, our round green metal-pipe mailbox who rests in an open-faced coffin of sorts, a long wooden box with cubbies full of other hicks' mailboxes, sunk into the ground three feet on cemented metal pipes (no relation to EmBee).This afternoon, The Pony hopped out of T-Hoe and pranced over to EmBee. He yanked open her flat round mouth and reached his arm down her throat. It was like a roadside, overgrown game of Feely Meely. Out came a white plastic bag, rolled into the shape of EmBee's innards, a couple pieces of junk mail, and a mail order catalog. The Pony turned that package every which way but loose.\"What's that package?\"\"I don't know. Something Genius sent, maybe?\"\"You don't understand. Genius doesn't send US things. WE send Genius things.\"\"I don't get the address.\"\"WAIT! Is it even addressed to us?\" For a moment I had forgotten the not-so-illustrious track record of the dead-mouse-smelling post office.\"I think so.\" By this time I was driving up our gravel road, with The Pony, my personal mail-sorter, investigating our package.\"What's the return address?\"\"I don't know. ABC Capitol Drive. South Backroads.\"\"That's the main post office! What in the world would they be sending me? Let me feel it.\" Yes. I can drive up a gravel road and molest a mystery bag at the same time. Heavens to Betsy! The contents of that package defied description. But I'll describe them anyway. There were two longish lumps at both ends. And something very flat in the middle. That curved or bent if you tried to see how flexible it was. \"I don't have a clue.\" We pulled into the garage. \"Do you want to open it in here?\"\"Not really. It's not MY package.\"\"It can't be the missing books that they're sending me. Unless they're gutted, and there's only two. But that return address does say, \"Customer Service.\"I hurried out of T-Hoe, out of the garage, past wiggly Juno with barely a pat pat here, not even enough time to take a bite of nose, and into the kitchen.

The Pony is readying a short story submission for entrance in the National Young Arts Foundation competition. It's the end of first quarter at school. I've been trying to watch the Cardinals in the playoffs. My books arrived. I've been walking up and down the halls wearing a sandwich board hawking my wares of the print kind. So I've fallen behind a bit in keeping the old cat-house up-to-date.Last night I decided to watch the first three-and-a-half innings of the game. All was well after the Cardinals batted at the top of the fourth. Zero to zero. I had the DVR going, so I went to my dark basement lair. Around ten, I called my mom. Still from the office, because I didn't want to go out and accidentally hear the score if The Pony had left the TV on the game channel. I had talked to Mom early in the evening, and told her I probably wouldn't call later, because I was going to watch the recording of the game.Mom answered the phone after a couple of rings.\"Don't tell me anything about the game. I just want to know if it's over. I'm recording it.\"\"Oh, I'm pretty sure it's over. I quit watching because they were behind.\"\"Why did you do that? What part of 'don't say anything about the game' didn't you understand?\"\"Well, I don't know. Once they got--\"\"STOP IT!\"\"I was brushing my teeth, and had a mouthful of toothpaste. So I spit it out and ran to answer the phone so you wouldn't think I was asleep.\"\"One would think that a mouthful of toothpaste might have helped more in stopping you from singing like a canary.\"\"Well, I didn't think I was giving anything away.\"\"This is the THIRD time! The other night, I told you I just had a minute because I was watching the game, and you said, 'Oh, I'm glad they got the third out.' And then the Cardinals got the third out. I just thought you were wishing, and it happened. And the next inning, you said, 'Good. They got two out with that double play.' And I wondered, what game is she watching? Because the batter was still walking up to the plate when you said it. Then the Cardinals got a double play. But by now I had figured out that you're not actually psychic, but that your cable is faster than my satellite. And I TOLD you not to tell me stuff like that during a game.\"Oh. Well. If I think of anything else, I can tell you in the morning.\"\"What if I haven't had time to watch the game yet?\"My mom.

The replacement books. The replacement books graciously provided by the publisher because she's a stand-up gal.

Okay, so he didn't wrap them, they weren't a surprise, and I have to pay for them. It's the thought that counts.I skipped out the door, unencumbered, off to town for a 44 oz. Diet Coke and a few groceries. Backroads was my oyster. As I backed out of the garage, something felt different. Almost as if I was encroaching on the steering wheel. Hm. Maybe I need to cut back on the gas station chicken. That thought flitted across my mind, but since I have not had any gas station chicken for over two weeks, I shoved that flittery thought to the very back of my gray matter, near the rear emergency exit.Still. Something was different. I jounced up the driveway. Must be that Service Suspension System message that keeps popping up on T-Hoe's control center. Hick said he had it checked when he got the tires, and my air shocks are deflated. Along with my spirit when it comes to him and kitchen-counter onion disposal. Hick said we'll get the shocks over Thanksgiving break. That it's no big deal unless I plan to tow a heavy load. Looks like the stockpile of handbaskets for my proposed factory will just have to pile up in one place for a while. I could not shake the feeling that I was listing forward. Like a toddler in his stepmother's stiletto heels. Like a puppy having his nose pressed down towards the carpet to acknowledge his indoor accident. Like a Soap Box Derby car at the starting line.My princess butt detected something amiss. And it was not a pea. I felt like I was driving a monster truck. Over a line of cars that were being crushed under my giant tires. All I needed was a name. Not Bigfoot, Grave Digger, or Undertaker. Those were, as Elaine might say of her saved movie theater seats, TAKEN! But I could be Bigbutt. Or Nose Digger. Or Underwear Picker. I was happily planning my next career when I arrived on the outskirts of town.As I clambered down from T-Hoe's command center, I glanced at my new tires. Surely not. The rear tires looked...how you say...um...I don't know...perhaps...HUMONGOUS compared to the front tires. I lit up the invisible communication lines right away, firing off a text to Hick at the bowling alley a half mile away. \"I think you got the wrong size tires!\" He had mentioned, after all, that the shop didn't have the exact same tire as T-Hoe sported on the front from last year. But that he had purchased the same tire in a different brand. Hick, in a few short words, instructed me the equivalent of not allowing my granny panties to bunch up or give birth to a bovine, for he would investigate the incongruency when he arrived home.Going up the driveway, just before I pushed the garage door opener to try and break its distance record, I checked the fancy gewgaw on T-Hoe's dashboard that tells how many pounds of pressure are in each tire. Front tires: 32 PSI. Rear tires: 42 PSI.My membership card for Mystery, Inc. remains unrevoked."}, {"title": "Baby Needs a New Pair of Tires", "date": "Saturday, October 12, 2013", "text": "Looks like Val is late to the party. You WERE throwing me a party, weren't you? Not skulking away because of the 15-minute rule. As long as you are all gathered here, waiting with bated eyes to see what Val's subject is this evening, let's take a little poll. What would you like to read about? Hahahaha! You didn't really think I would take your suggestions, did you? Put your hands down before somebody tears a rotator cuff.I could wax all congenial, and talk about world peace. Or harsher punishment for parole violators. Or I could point out the Even-Stevenness of my world, what with Genius coming home from college today, and asking for $50 gas money to return, then the curious coincidence of scratching off a lottery ticket to find that I won $50. But I think I'll share a little tale of how changing my spots backfired on this ol' Val this afternoon.T-Hoe has pulled up lame. For the past two weeks, he's been favoring his driver's side rear tire. It loses a pound of air per day. Not a big problem, what with three easy air hoses between home and work. And a faithful Pony to hop out and refill, while I sit in the driver's seat and watch the dashboard tire poundage gadget to tell him \"when.\" T-Hoe has had this problem before, which turned out to be a bad valve stem. A leather-jacket-wearing, insolent, lip-cigarette-dangling, switchblade-totin', greaser-DA-hairstyled valve stem. Last year, that problem was solved by rotating the front tires to the rear, and getting two new front tires. This year, Hick decided I needed two new rear tires. Tires don't grow on trees, you know. It's not like we can run out and buy a bushel. We have to budget. So Hick took my T-Hoe to the tire store this morning.He returned in time to take The Pony to his bowling league. I took T-Hoe to town for a spate of shopping. Just some bananas, yogurt, onions, and crunchy fish filets. No. They don't all go in the same dish. More about this shopping excursion at a later date. It can stand clear like those Parmalee boys at the showdown between Rooster Cogburn and Lucky Ned Pepper in True Grit. I have no interest in it today.The town trip itself was fairy uneventful. No traffic Not-Heaven-bent on running me off the road. No road walkers. No bridge blockers. No snakes hanging from tree limbs one shatterproof piece of glass from my face, and only mild weirdos in Save A Lot. I enjoyed the beautiful sunshine after our morning downpour. Slathered my threatening-to-crack lips with mint Chapstick as I do every day during my drive. Surfed my SiriusXM for oldies. I had just returned and finishing putting away my purchases when Hick and The Pony showed up.They were about 90 minutes early for their bowling return. None of The Pony's opponents showed up, so they bowled a blind, which was speedy. I was firing up my front-window laptop internet connection as they came through the kitchen door. As I started to exit the living room to change out of my presentable town clothes into my comfortable home clothes, Hick started into the living room. We were at an impasse between the short-couch end table and the wooden railing that keeps us from tumbling twelve feet to the bottom of the open basement stairs.I put my arms around Hick's neck. Some might call it a hug. I calls it a sumo-attempt to work my way past him to leave the living room. Mmmhmmm. At some point during the hugging-squeezing battle for home supremacy, my face ended up on Hick's right shoulder. I pulled back.\"I could swear I just got a hair in my mouth off of your shirt.\"\"Could be. I went to get a haircut.\"I hope you grasp the full horror of this seemingly trivial event. My Chapstick-coated lips picked up snipped hair from Hick's shirt like masking tape wrapped the wrong way around one's hand picks up cat hair off black dress pants.No Val hug goes unpunished."}, {"title": "Time is Paper", "date": "Friday, October 11, 2013", "text": "I have some advice for Sprint.Today I opened my bill, nine pages long, with two pages being full-page promotional materials for...you guessed it...SPRINT!

I don't, because I never grasped the meaning of that whole \"irony\" concept. But maybe you do, and you will.I have no desire to switch to paperless billing. If the simple act of driving a box of books to my post office without losing them cannot be done by the U.S. Postal Service, what guarantee do I have that Sprint won't incur some glitch that wreaks havoc with my vital information?Paperless billing is a gateway notification to automatic payment. I'll be having none of that. Sprint already uses the devious tactic of \"saving paper\" by making customers carefully peel away their billing envelope in order to re-fold it for mailing back the payment. As if becoming an unwilling practitioner of the ancient art of origami will make us divulge our personal information online. I've had it with Sprint's passive-aggressive ways.

I guess I need to actually read the thing by Monday. It might be bad form to try to wing it, in case he mentions something about the plot when I chat with him.What if I'm the only one who shows up, what with people not knowing about it?

It seems like only yesterday The Pony was still in middle school, insisting that the gory sheet ghost hanging a block away from his building was the Annual Autumn Ketchup Tablecloth Yard Ornament. The Pony sometimes can't see the forest for the trees. Or the ghost for the tablecloth.We leave home during the early morning hours, before the sun has risen. Depending on fog and cloud cover, we move half-blind to the garage. It's dark in there, you know. Dark, until I hit the garage door opener mounted just inside the walk-in door, the little thingy that looks like an upright rectangular doorbell button to normal people. That turns on an overhead light that's not too bright. Kind of like the guy who installed it, at select moments.This morning, The Pony took a bag of trash over to the dumpster. Juno followed him, forsaking a chance for me to chew on her rubbery black nose before leaving for work. As The Pony came back to the sidewalk, to step inside the door I had just opened, Juno gamboled up the steps and ran to a side-porch position for a mini-lovefest. I paused to hug her, keeping my lips firmly together. That's when I heard it.\"Um. Mom. LOOK WHAT'S IN HERE!\"I stepped into the gloomy two-car vehicle sanctuary.

In truth, that is a pair of Hick's jeans. Yes. Out here in Backroads, it is not uncommon for a man to take off his pants and walk around the porch in his tighty-whities. Just one of the perks of living in the middle of nowhere, where people stuff bodies in septic tanks, and leave unrequested bags of hedgeapples on porches.Before Hick left for his bowling league this evening, I showed him this picture I made The Pony snap with a flash on his phone camera. \"Look at what your son was exposed to this morning in the garage.\"\"Ha. You mean my pants? They were all smoky from the bonfire. Huh. That looks like a ghost. You should put that on your thing and scare people.\" Oh, I don't need Hick's advice on how to scare people.

It's my way of saving the environment. No Russell Dalrymple and Greenpeace antics for me. I read them, pass them to Mom, who gives them to her neighbor across the way, who gives them to an old lady down the road, who gives them to an elderly friend, who donates them to the local ministerial alliance, and so on. I wouldn't be surprised if Kevin Bacon ended up with them.After our brief visit, I stepped out on the porch to walk through Mom's mole-tunneled yard to T-Hoe. Mom really needs to get some of those spinning metal sunflower thingies before I pull up lame. Of course I could have walked down the concrete porch to the steps by the garage, but my knees would rather do battle with molehills all the live-long day than descend a mountain.Looking up from my sinking feet at the edge of the driveway, I glanced across the road. There's a house that was vacant for quite some time, and an older couple moved in several months back. Their first contact with Mom was to ask if their relatives could park along the edge of her side of the road for a family reunion. Mom agreed. Not knowing that the entire population of Rhode Island was showing up. She has had little to no contact with them since. People are private like that around here.On the porch of that house sat a white-haired man. He was well over 75 yards away, but to me he looked like that man you might have seen on the internet who got in trouble for slapping a baby on a plane. It was SO creepy. He was simply sitting there. Watching. No wave. No, \"Howdy, neighbor.\" Silently watching. From an Adirondack chair. Or maybe a woven-strip lawn chair. My brain was focused on his face. I climbed into T-Hoe. Then whispered to Mom, who had followed to the porch, but not the mole-swiss-cheesed yard. \"Hey. There's a man staring at us.\"\"Oh, I know. He does that all the time. It's gotten to the point that I won't come out to work in my yard if I see him over there. And when I come out, and he comes out later, I go back in. I figure I can trim my tree or water my flowers later, when he's not there. It kind of bothers me.\"I know what she means. I went about my merry dead-mouse-smelling-post-office way, and waved from the road. I used to toot my horn for her, but that didn't feel right with The Observer.Last night, I called Mom to tell her of Genius's visit with his college buddies. After soaking in all things Genius, Mom asked, \"When you left my house the other day, was there anything on the porch?\"\"No. I didn't see anything. This is not like that time you came home a couple years ago and found a cinnamon roll wrapped in foil with one bite gone, and thought that your friend left it and a dog got into it, is it? Because I told you then that a dog wouldn't take one bite and wrap it back up, and something fishy was going on.\"\"No. But I looked out a couple hours after you left, and there were three bags sitting there on the edge of the porch, right across from the door.\"\"You mean under your seasons flag? You really need to change that. It's fall, you know. What's on there now?\"\"That's where it was. I have a \"Celebration\" flag up. For the 4th of July. It's not a flag, but it has red stripes and stars. The bags were full of hedgeapples. I don't know who put them there. It might have been that man down the road. You know, where Lang and Shirl used to live? He brought me some one time. They keep bugs out of the basement. I took one bag and scattered them out in the basement that evening, and I was down there today, and didn't see one bug. But I don't need THREE bags. Just the one. I don't know what to do with the other two. And I'd kind of like to find out who brought them. I know it wasn't my friend. She always calls after she gets home, and tells me to look on the porch. And if it was my neighbors, they would have called, too. So I guess it must have been that man from down the road, but he didn't give me any last year. So it seems conly funny.\"\"Mom. When was the last time that guy gave you hedgeapples?\"\"Well, it wasn't very long after your dad died. So I guess it was...about 12 years ago.\"\"MOM! Nobody is going to give you hedgeapples for your basement one year, and then bring them again 12 years later, without once talking to you! Something is weird here.\"\"I really wish I knew who left them. Maybe they meant to leave them somewhere else, and stopped at the wrong house. And I've already used one bag!\"\"This is creeping me out. Remember that girl I used to teach with, whose husband was in college at Rolla? They had an apartment, and the guy next door kept taking their morning paper. She said something to him about it, and the next morning her paper was on her doormat. With a dead bird looking over it at her, its wings outstretched. This is LIKE THAT!\"\"Ooh! That's terrible. But I'm sure there's an explanation.\"\"What if it was The Observer, Mom? Maybe he saw me leave, then ran over here with some hedgeapples?\"\"Oh, I don't think he would do that. They stay to themselves. When his wife is working in the yard, and I go out, SHE GOES INSIDE!\"\"You mean like you do when HE comes out?\"\"Well...hahaha...yes. But that's different.\"\"I don't know, Mom. This porch stuff is weird. But thank goodness you've given me something to look forward to after sewing up that hole in the knee of your pants.

It's kind of hard, even though there's that ample target. I have balance issues. A one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest could do a better job of butt-kicking than I. IF he showed up on time for his butt-kicking contest. Which is my problem.There were two contests I had planned to enter. Neither of them was a butt-kicking contest. I had my topics all picked out. A rough outline in my head of the points I wanted to make. A plethora of humorous references to include in my manuscripts. But I did not make the time to complete my great literary works. Surefire Pulitzer prizers. Left clinging to the sides of my brain like Stove Top Stuffing left to harden overnight on the stove top by a husband and a low teen.I should scrap that proposed handbasket factory, and form a business called The Road to Not-Heaven Good Intentions Paving Company. I will need to hire burly, fit-fat, barrel-chested men so that our company name can be easily read on their neon green work T-shirts.Seriously. I am barely treading water with this writing business. I'm good at actual water-treading, though, thanks to my college Swimming and Diving Techniques teacher, who made us all pass the drownproofing test in the deep end of the indoor pool. Fifty minutes keeping your head above sixteen feet of water without touching the sides pretty much prepares you for keeping your head above sixteen feet of water without touching the sides for fifty minutes. Just in case you ever fall into the middle of the pool and the lifeguards are really inattentive.I always have ideas percolating like spurts of Folger's in the clear glass stopper top of a 1960s chrome coffeepot. Sometimes I even jot these ideas down in my trusty tiny flip-top spiral notebook. But I am unable to bring them to fruition. And I only watch TV two nights a week! The evening flies by so fast, what with slicing the occasional onion for Hick, and warming food in the oven or heating it in the microwave.I have only written one letter to Genius at college. I know that boy lays on his jacked-up bed strung with blinking Christmas lights which he sells on the side at a profit using my Amazon Prime membership, tears dripping into his ears while pining for a letter from Mommy dearest. Sure, I have my personal secretary, The Pony, send him one-line texts on occasional mornings from the seat behind me in T-Hoe on the way to school. But it's not the same as getting mail out of the box. At least his grandma sends him a card every week.I don't think it's the blogging that's slowing me down. I can whip out two blog posts in an hour every night. It gets my creativity oozing. To sit down and try to write my Pulitzers before blogging would be kind of like shaving your legs while they're dry and crusty. Not that my legs are dry and crusty, of course. Or hairy. We're talking about your legs, not mine. Maybe if I spent more time writing and less time talking about your legs, I would get to the end of my point and my stories sooner.

Last night he was working on his BARn, so I left him a splendid repast of fish, garlic bread, slaw, and a baked potato. Of course there was sliced onion on the side. The Onion Man is fond of onions. He's the first to fork them if we go to the all-you-can-eat catfish house. It's worse than competing with a teenage male for undesignated meat on a platter. Better strap on a pair of those stainless-steel-mesh gloves that butchers and oyster-shuckers wear, lest you receive a gaping flesh wound by fork-stabbing.When I ascended from my dark basement lair to the main floor last night in the early morning hours, the odor of onion permeated every molecule of inhaled household atmosphere. I smelled a rat. Something rotten in Backroads. Got wind of a fishy situation. I followed those noxious fumes like Pepe LePew following a vapor trail to his hoped-for paramour.Two onion slices remained on a paper plate on the kitchen counter. WHO DOES THAT? Eat them. Bag them. Or throw them off the back porch. Nobody wants two slices of onion that have cooled their rings on the counter for seven hours. Nobody.The Onion Man pretended to be progressing. \"Oh. The onions. I meant to throw them away. But I forgot about it.\"\"Could you not smell them with every fiber of your being? Like a butterfly with its antennae and feet? Like a pit-viper with its tongue?\"\"It wasn't a matter of not smelling it, Val. I meant to throw them out.

Not my proposed handbasket factory. Just my business, as in, it's none of your business.I also met up with my best old ex-teaching friend, Mabel. We had arranged our rendezvous two sentences at a time, by text, within the 50-minute interval that is my plan time. That's because our cellular providers don't see any urgency in placing communication towers in the Outer Backroadsia area, and home cell phone usage is like trying to talk on a long section of twine stretched between two tin cans. We can't even ask each other, \"Can you hear me now?\" We might as well type, \"Can you read me now?\" Texts are not instantaneous.Still, we are quite efficient, Mabel and I. The logistical ballet did not come near to rivaling the D-Day Invasion logistics of Mom and me planning to meet briefly to exchange already-read tabloids and two dollars. It was more akin to mounting a nationwide tour for the Barnum and Bailey Circus.I had not seen Mabel since May 17th. Graduation night. Our last, unbeknownst to me. And her. She up and surprise-retired over the summer. Notifying me by text, of course. You'd think we were separated by more than one thin county line, and less than the distance of Rhode Island's diameter. But we weren't.Our joyous celebration (not to be confused with a somber celebration) took place at a midway city park. Mabel and I stopped short of grasping hands, tilting our noses in the air, and serpentining a Snoopy toe-tapping dance through the primary-colored playground equipment. However...Mabel stole three years worth of hugs from Val's prickly persona. I do not plan to press charges for the flesh-pressing.We selected a concrete picnic table three meters from the parking area. Of course that signaled a horde of morning park-walkers to converge like locusts from the wisps of fog. A closer resemblance of those walkers to the entire populace of WhoVille could not have been engineered through cloning. Young, old, male, female, fit, fat, fit-fat, scrawny, hairy, smooth, bowlegged, knock-kneed, erect, humped, dog-walking, baby-carrying, toddler-pushing...I'm sure they had all plopped a roast beast into the crockpot before leaving their colorful, curlicued homes.Every time one lady went past, I thought I recognized her back. I finally mentioned it to Mabel, who informed me that my backquaintance stared at me each time she walked by. Finally, Backquaintance said, \"Are you retired?\" Dang! Spies are everywhere! No. I am not retired. But Backquaintance is. She's a friend and neighbor of my newly-retired sister, the ex-mayor's wife. Backquaintance should be ashamed, out spying for The Man.\"No. I'm taking a personal day. You can't get me in trouble if you try!\" I also made note that Backquaintance was pushing her toddler granddaughter around the park at 110.5 mph in a red plastic automobile. That's what the dashboard decal said, anyway. No wonder that kid threw a shoe that took two laps to recover. We agreed that our blackmail data cancelled out any upper-hand-gaining contact with respective authorities.Mabel and I had a delightful visit. I refrained from treating a walked-dog's nose like Bubble Yum. And Mabel ate a bug. A good time was had by all. Except maybe the bug."}, {"title": "A Tale of Two Biddies", "date": "Wednesday, October 2, 2013", "text": "Today I invaded two U.S. Post Offices to inquire about my missing box of books. I was quite polite. You never know when a federal worker might whip a weapon out from under the counter. Just for show, of course. To discourage people who enter at ten minutes before the lunch hour shut-down to question exactly what goes on during the shipping of precious cargo.Oh, what a different vibe each Post Office emits! They're like snowflakes! Like fingerprints! Like DNA!The first stop was at the local hub. Everything hauled to rural areas comes out of this facility now. Things that don't fit in the mailbox are brought back, then trucked to the neighborhood Post Office the next day for pickup with a little orange postcard.The Hub had no discernible smell. Kind of like a dog's nose right before it enters one's mouth uninvited. I passed through two sets of glass doors and stepped up to the middle of the counter, where the lone worker worked. She consciously ignored me. You know that action. I know it well. I was, after all, a public servant myself, once. I call it a Public Service Standoff. In this version, the worker knows you're there. You know the worker knows you're there. The worker keeps working. So busy. Such vital duties. You know the game. So you wait. You don't want to set yourself up for a rebuff.Finally, Stick Woman acknowledged me. \"All right now. How can I help you?\" She had hair like straw. Like it was sticking right out the wrist cuffs of The Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz. It was not her natural hair color. She was all angular, like a Picasso Weeping Woman. Only not so pretty.I explained my predicament. I could detect the beginnings of a smirk. She said she would take a look in the back to see if there was a box of books. I know she rolled her eyes the minute her back was turned. I suspect she simply stepped to the side out of my vision, then came right back. \"No. There's no package back there. Without a tracking number, we really have nothing to investigate.\" She reached around the back-room wall and grabbed a form. \"All I can suggest is that you fill out this claim form with the tracking number, and submit it to see if your box might be in the Dead Letter Facility.\"She did not seem thrilled when I asked for a phone number and a name to contact with the tracking number. \"Here's the number. Just ask for a supervisor.\"After such marked success, I headed for my mom's house to wait for the lunch hour to be over at my next Post Office. It's not pleasant to stand in line at the metal roll-top-desk thingy they pull down during their noonday feast. I can imagine them peeping through pinholes in that silver curtain, snickering behind their Cheeto-encrusted hands. The dead-mouse-smelling Post Office had an aura all its own. The lady at the counter was a comfortable sort, with a face like an applehead doll, who had obviously never been introduced to Mademoiselle L'Oreal. A golfer-looking thirtysomething in a white knit shirt stood first in line, obtaining tracking numbers for his package. Next in line, but off to the side, leaning on the counter, was a scrawny man who appeared to be in his fifth decade of a hard-knock life. Like Smoky Lonesome in Fried Green Tomatoes, just before Idgie told him the story about the geese flying away with the lake.Apple Head asked to help Hard-Knock. He apologized for bothering her, and pointed to a package on the side shelf that rattled like pills. He thanked Apple Head profusely, explained that he was down on his luck, and asked if he might keep his general delivery address for a bit longer. She agreed.Apple Head looked in the back room for my box of books. She apologized for my loss. And before I had a chance to ask, she wrote down the number of the Hub Post Office and told me to ask for a supervisor when I had the tracking number. Same result. Different delivery.I suppose there's something about working in a dead-mouse miasma that keeps one humble."}, {"title": "Val is the New Sasquatch", "date": "Tuesday, October 1, 2013", "text": "Mom really enjoyed hearing about my afternoon nosh on Juno's nose. If laughter is the best medicine, she will be immune to a multitude of ailments in the near future. Furthermore, after talking to her last night around 9:30, then calling her again this morning at 6:00, she informed me she had not really learned anything new during that time period. But she had laughed out loud every time she thought of Juno's nose between my teeth. I assured her I had not tasted any other dogs' noses overnight. And that I awoke with a funny taste in my mouth.As if that little snout-munching episode is not enough to make a believer of you...here is incident #19,478 to illustrate how the universe conspires against me.Perhaps I mentioned that I have stories published in Not Your Mother's Book...on Being a Parent, and Not Your Mother's Book...on Home Improvement. Both anthologies were released on the 11th of September. I have been waiting for my copies of these editions, as I have many fans clamoring to read them, asking how they can get their hands on such modern classics. Of course I refer them to Amazon, and also tell them I can be the middleman. My loyal fans have been patiently awaiting their Val brain candy.Being a novice at this book-hawking business, I did not sense anything amiss in the lengthy time it is taking to get my books. Maybe things just run this slow in The Business. I do not ever want it said that Val is a complainer. Stop that! I'm serious!Today I had a message on my machine to call the CEO herself about the problem with my book shipment. \"Isn't that special!\" I thought. \"She's taking the time to call me in person. She must be psychic! I have never even asked where my books might be.\" Maybe I should have.Seems the company received the shipping envelope thingy that was taped to the box, and the invoice as well, from the USPS. How kind of the USPS to mail back all that pertinent information that was attached to my box of books, yet not the box of books! The USPS says they have no idea where the books are. They are in the dead-mouse-smelling triangle, I suppose.Tomorrow, I have to go to two TWO TWO post offices to inquire as to the whereabouts of my books. Seriously. How can a box of books disappear? It's not like they're two tubes of Clearasil left on top of my mailbox row for two hours in a pharmacy package. It's not like people around here have a thirst for knowledge. Or yearn for it. I know I will eventually get my books, one way or another. I'm just tired of the universe conspiring against me.

She stands on the side porch while I stand on the sidewalk to the garage.I don't know what got into my sweet, sweet Juno. Instead of the loving, chuffing, hot dog breath on my throat, I was treated to a wet, rubbery, dog nose in my mouth. It was like an extra-large Jujube in texture, though not at all like a Jujube in taste.I recoiled in horror! Had I just bitten into a dog's nose? It wasn't my fault, actually. I was talking at the time Juno made her move. And VOILA! Instant dog nose!Do you have any idea where a dog's nose has been? If we were to take Google Street View and turn it into Dog Nose View, I'm sure we would be privy to shots of other dogs' anuses, dripping dogs' urethras, the waxy insides of other dogs' ears, the crusty corners of other dogs' eyes, logs of other dogs' poop, cow pies of the pasture kind, steaming innards of once-fluffy bunnies, liquified possum carcasses, and grass, lots of grass, to clear the canine nasal palate.I hope that Juno's schnoz was not damaged.

Perhaps I've told you about my own personal beauty shop: Terrible Cuts. I used their check-in app. Because there's nothing I like better than cutting in line ahead of people who think they're up next. I don't agree with it, but if Terrible Cuts wants to give me the option to be a poor sport, I'll make use of it. Better me than them. Sure as I'd walk in and wait my turn, ten hairy people would arrive and all go ahead of me.When I did my smart-phone check-in from my Save A Lot parking space, the wait time was 0 minutes. Of course when I got there, five people were inside, two being cut, two milling around, and one ensconced on a plastic black chair like she was never leaving.A tweenage boy in football pants joined the millers at the pay counter. He had a new buzz cut, and looked kind of like Buzz in the Home Alone movie. My boys' hair never cooperated with a buzz cut. Theirs laid down, all sleek, like a seal. None of that cute spiky porcupiny toilet brush stiffness for their follicles. The buzz cutter swept up and called me next. Take THAT, already-waiting-woman-reading-a-women's-magazine! You can sit there with that dude who just came in, smelling all manly, like old leather shoes worn without socks, garden-plowing sweat, and pipe tobacco.My Terrible Cutter the buzz cutter was perfectly adequate. She could have pleased Goldilocks herself. She took just enough time, cut just enough off, made just enough conversation, and ripped just enough roots from my scalp in her zealous up-clipping to shear the under layers. One area where she excelled was in whacking me with something that felt like a caveman's club or a medieval mace, once above the left ear, and once under the left eye. Let the record show that she did say, \"Oops! Sorry!\" both times. She did not have a hacking cough, or lean on me more than a Terrible Cutter should. In fact, she was quite adept at the hair salon ballet. Especially given the fact that neither I nor she were of acceptable BMI. She revolved around me like Saturn around Jupiter. Like those pudgy planets on the Jimmy Dean breakfast solar system commercials.I welcomed her lack of small talk. I alternated between keeping my eyes closed, and watching the other Terrible Cutter work her magic in the mirror. She was on the same woman as when I entered the establishment. She was probably on her when I checked in from another town. She had been cutting in the beginning. Then she combed, like trying out various looks on her Barbie Styling Head. Then she spritzed that woman's locks with water. Combed some more. Got out the blow dryer. Poofed it up a bit. Spritzed it. Combed it. Snipped a little. It was as if that woman had been there so long that her just-cut hair had grown long enough for more cutting.

I can't call on the school phone, because an individual uses the only outside line every single day from final bell until 4:00. After regaining service, like Apollo astronauts passing through the Van Allen Radiation Belt, my phone went crazy. A voice mail. That never works, so I had The Pony call Mom.\"I was afraid you had gone without me. It's been a half hour since school was out.\"\"We just got underway. I have a job, you know. That requires me to work. We didn't forget you. We were just getting ready to call.\"\"Okay. Bye. I have to get going.\"Mom did not wear her gray sweatpants with the hole in them!

That's when I backed over the compact car driven by the crazy meth-beard man who had a pitbull on a chain, and yelled, 'GET BACK IN THE CAR!' when I went back to exchange insurance information. Then I found out he was talking to the dog. And he didn't want to call the police, because I only bent his license plate with my trailer hitch, and he didn't even stay to do his bank transaction. I had asked The Pony if there was anything behind me, because that guy was so close he was in my blind spot. The Pony told me it was okay, then I found out he hadn't even turned around to look.\"\"Oh. Are we still going to Arby's?\"\"Yes, if you want to. But Hick called and said he wants Chinese, and The Pony wants Chinese more, but they're going to be gone all day tomorrow, so I can get Arby's to save for my lunch. However...you didn't wear your Arby's pants.\"\"Well, it's too hot for them today.\"\"Mom. It was hotter than this last time you wore them. I guess now that you sewed up the knee hole, they're stifling.\"\"These jeans are cooler.\"\"Yeah. Jeans are so comfortable in 85 degrees. Not like those threadbare gray sweatpants.\"We went on to pay the house bill at a different drive-thru in a different town. Mom asked again. \"So we're going\u00a0 to Arby's?\"\"Yes. Right after this.\"\"I think I saw on their commercial that they have a little chicken sandwich. I think I'll get a little chicken sandwich. I still have roast beef in my freezer from last week.\"\"I don't remember that. But you can ask when we go in. I'm going to pay with a $20, so I'll get whatever you want.

Can you believe that, on a Friday evening at the end of the month? As if people would rather spend their money on a real restaurant. Or Chinese. We were the only customers, except for a disgruntled one waiting for the manager. Which probably would not bode well for your average Arby'sgoers, but did nothing to deter us. Mom asked about the little chicken. Nope. Arby's doesn't have little chicken. So uncharacteristic of a roast beef establishment. Mom decided she did not want anything! What a bait and switch! Harp about going to Arby's, dress up for the occasion, even, and then decide on nothing.Oh, well. The Pony, who had declared that he did not want anything, strapped on the old feedbag and ate up his Sierra Mist and molten lava. Mom thoroughly enjoyed my tales out of school during the drive time, though I forgot one particularly juicy tidbit that I will call her with tonight, when the Cardinals game is over. AND...even though Mom didn't get anything in Arby's, she gave me two dollars when we got back to the car. For anyone keeping track, that puts Val out of the negative column.

I think somebody will really appreciate that.I stood by my door this morning after first bell, during that passing period students have to dash to class and relinquish their social ties for 50 minutes.

A brown mark upon the beauty that is a public school in that golden hour before students invade and pillage like Vikings in a Capitol One commercial.A colleague, schooled in the mysteries of science, as is Val herself, strode down that besmirched path. She stepped over the offending mud clump. Stopped. Released a bellow of outrage. I joined in. \"I know! It's only first hour, and they've already trashed the place!\"CollyG bend down and picked it up. I never knew cleanliness was next to chemistry-teacherness.

Just because it was discovered along my classroom frontage did not mean that I wanted to lay claim.Silly me. I thought CollyG would throw the expired overgrown tadpole in the trash. But no. She set off merrily down the hall, to a cluster of our cronies. They gathered 'round, thinking, perhaps, that CollyG had brought them a tasty morsel from the breakfast line.

Such a narcissist is Hick.Every time I sit down at my living room laptop, or walk through the upstairs square footage over my dark basement lair, Hick heckles me. \"Hey! You're always writing stories about me. You haven't even asked me about my snake story.\"No. I have not. Is that something you would think to ask YOUR spouse? Oh, honey...what about your snake story? Yeah. I didn't think that was quite the mainstream marriage conversation topic that Hick imagines it to be.Tonight, just after we both pulled into the garage at the same time, and right before Hick left for his bowling league, I hit on that bait. \"Hey, what about your snake story?\"\"What snake story?\"\"For days you've been hinting that you want to tell me a snake story.

Depending on the day, I might be worth up to eight dollars. Then there are the days my value plummets into negative figures. Not often. But it happens. I blame the conspiratorial universe, always out to thwart Val's best intentions.Today blog buddy Tammy posed a question: \"How did your mother manage to humiliate you?\"Contrary to well-informed readership's popular opinion, my mother did not humiliate me by prancing around Arby's like a defector from the Bolshoi Ballet, flaunting the hole in her pants like a rare jewel romanced from the Nile by Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner, with the help of bumbling Danny DeVito. No. Mom is Mom, and she's going to let her unfiltered flag fly as she sees fit. Her humiliation of a tender young Val occurred more privately. Subtly.During my college years, Mom called me every Sunday morning. Unfailingly, every single week, no matter whether I lived on the 8th floor of a high-rise dorm, in a classy 2nd-floor apartment with a balcony across from a large cemetery, in a five-bedroom rental house a block from campus, in an apartment across town with a lesbian couple and a front-door peephole that was only a short metal tube that we blocked with masking tape, or in a four-bedroom bungalow with a mushroom growing through the bathroom carpet...Mom always asked near the beginning of that phone call, \"Is somebody there?\" She was not talking about my roommates.Let the record show that Val was never promiscuous. No Winona Ryder in Girl, Interrupted was she. Not a slut. Not a loose young lady. Not an employee, nor proprietor, of a house of ill repute. So there was no need for that question, spoken in a conspiratorial manner, as if she was willing to keep my secret should I only divulge it.Where Mom got the idea that I was involved in overnight entertaining, I do not know. I was not one to have a steady boyfriend. In high school, I hung out with my group. Two girls and three guys. We were like Tom Cruise's nerd gang in Risky Business. Well. With the exception of that couple who got it on in the upstairs bedroom. And that whole brothel business to get money to buy back the household furnishings from Guido the Killer Pimp.Sure, I dated that older guy who wrote for the Post-Dispatch. I only did it while home for the summer as a favor to my hometown college buddy who was dating my roommate. Could I help it that Mom peeped through the living room sheers at that inopportune moment on the carport?Oh, I had opportunities to date at sleep-away college. But I turned them all down. There was that lanky red-headed guy on my intramural basketball team, and the curly-topped dark-haired short dude on my intramural volleyball team, and the body-builder with the lazy eye who was part of my entourage that attended a national convention in Boston, and the Kansas pig-farmer with the hairiest legs I'd ever seen. Okay...that last one was a gal, not that there's anything wrong with that. But the point is that I was at college to LEARN, by cracky, not to get my MRS degree. I don't know what Mom was thinking, asking me if anyone was there every Sunday morning of my college career. Because other than the dozen-or-so rent-paying folks legally contracted to occupy the same abodes, none of whom were romantically attached to Val, NOBODY WAS EVER THERE! I found that line of questioning to be humiliating. Falsely accusatory.Like Curtis Armstrong (better known as Booger in Revenge of the Nerds) told Tom Cruise just before setting him up for his whole Risky Business...\"Sometimes, you have to say WTF?\""}, {"title": "Thevictorians Don Their Smarty Pants for Charity", "date": "Saturday, September 21, 2013", "text": "Last night three Thevictorians hit the town to compete in a trivia event for charity. Val alone had planned to attend, but was joined by Hick, who invited himself at 5:57 a.m. while Val was still groggy from her recliner nap. Genius made a surprise trip home from the halls of higher learning, and was spirited away before he knew what hit him.The return of Genius was known to Val since Monday night. She was under strict orders to be a lady, and reveal nothing. You can imagine how difficult that was for Val. The departure time for trivia was 6:00, and Genius's arrival was projected to be 5:30. Hick had just settled himself into his La-Z-Boy with a snack of a 3-day-old Arby's Jr. Val sat at her laptop in the front living room window, trying to will recalcitrant internet fumes through the glass and into her Shiba like enticing a genie back into his bottle. Hick sat up suddenly, slamming the footrest back into that La-Z-Boy. \"Here comes Genius up the driveway!\"You could hear it in his voice, in only those six words. Why, WHY did I invite myself to trivia! My son is home! MY SON IS HOME! I want to spend time with my son. Who is home. Right now!\"You don't have to go to trivia. I'd planned on going by myself. It's all right if you want to stay home.\"We waited. Genius had a mini-lovefest with the hounds on the front sidewalk. He made a grand entrance. Or he would have. But Hick had locked the front door when he came in from the goat yard. \"You've locked him out, you know.\" Genius has a key. But it did seem rather rude for him to be locked out of his home while we sat on the other side of the door. Hick ran to let him in.\"You're home!\"\"Uh huh.\"\"I guess everyone knew but me?\"\"Uh huh.\"Genius had no plans for the evening except sleep or film developing. I invited him to trivia. \"It's at school. Maybe you can help with the scoring. Or you can visit. Or somebody might need you on a team. Ours is full already.\" The more he heard who was going to be there, the more Genius leaned toward spending time with his uncool mom and pop, at a trivia competition. We threw him into the back seat of T-Hoe, the one usually occupied by The Pony, who was spending the night at Grandma's.It's a good thing The Pony did not tag along, I suppose. We dropped about sixty dollars into the coffers, what with entry fees, mulligans, foot-long hot dogs, and raffle chances on a sports car. The foot-longs were probably unnecessary, what with our table full of popcorn and pretzels provided by the trivia-runners, and mini candy bars, store-bought Chex Mix, M&Ms, and sweet potato chips brought by participants. Still, who's gonna turn down a foot-long hot dog for a dollar? I paid for Genius, just in case he ended up on a team. He made the rounds, and was snapped up by one with a college buddy/high school friend due to graduate in December, along with several elementary teachers and a couple of kids. Of course they beat us. But we DID take second, after a tie-breaker. It was not a competition that favored our team of three science teachers, a computer geek, a music teacher, a business teacher, two church ladies, and Hick. Who throws a trivia competition without a science category? Not to mention includes categories in U.S. history, Missouri history, U.S. travel destinations, and sports? I'll tell you who! NOT science teachers. Those elementary teachers really know their history. But I'm willing to bet they couldn't diffuse their way out of a phospholipid bilayer bag.The high point, or probably the low point if you took a survey of competitors last evening, was when our team debated the multiple choice question concerning origin of the Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Run. We had narrowed our choices down to Wichita and Chicago, with the majority going for Chicago, since they seem to have a history of supporting police and firemen. Just after turning in our answer sheet, the computer dude married to the science gal sitting across the table from me said to us, \"Oh, sure, Chicago. I suppose they were also commemorating the great fire at the same time.\" His dry wit tickled my funny bone. We started to giggle.\"Maybe that first time, they were riding cows through the streets, holding their torches, in a true shout-out to that historical fire.\" We couldn't stop laughing. More than a few contestants stared at us like we were poking prancing unicorns with pointy sticks. Shame on us.I suppose it was Karma holding hands with Even Steven, skipping down the path to comeuppance, who caused that science gal to protest after the grading of the last round, that what we had marked as an Xbox logo was deemed to be the Xerox logo. Thus causing the committee to re-evaluate our answer sheet, and discredit that answer they had skimmed over and counted right. Which dropped us into a tie for second.Thank goodness we had estimated our score at only two points more than our final total.

Upon that paper stack rests my glasses while I am not actively doing close-up work in need of bifocals.Such an unfortunate chain of events. The tower-topping InterWrite is wedge-shaped. Apparently, the zealous custodian had been moving that upper echelon of educational accoutrements slightly each evening while dusting. The vibrations from the hip-checked table caused the InterWrite to topple off its penthouse digs, form a ramp, and act as a 45-degree slide for my prescription eyewear. The glasses slid to the bottom of Mount InterWrite, skipped across the only inches of white plastic tabletop not covered by electronics or a web of wires, and into the three-inch gap between table and wall that is left for electrical wire access.I heard my glasses hit the tile. Against the concrete block wall. Under my four-foot table. I fetched my wooden meter stick from the top edge of the whiteboard frame, and fished out the windows to the windows to my soul.Not quite as exciting as a bowling ball falling through a bathtub to knock a plastic diver guy into an old-fashioned washtub, but still an impressive display of cause, effect, and gravity."}, {"title": "Frig LIVES!", "date": "Thursday, September 19, 2013", "text": "Frig spontaneously healed himself!Perhaps you have heard that Frig became constipated or contrary a couple of weeks ago, and stopped dropping his ice pellets into the bin.

A virtual weblog rain forest dripping with bad grammar, made-up words, poor syntax, inopportune tense shifts, and sentences ending with prepositions.Perhaps it is simply wishful thinking. The thought that folks want to emulate Val. Or at the very least, send her an emu late at night, to interrupt her REM sleep, and render her unable to spread her special brand of prose-without-rules from coast to coast. Border to border. Into space, the final frontier.Like a New York cook named Mary dishing out hot typhoid, like a yawning Student Zero spreading lethargy throughout a seventh-hour late-August classroom, like Charles D. Campion releasing Captain Trips on the world via East Texas...Val has spread the seed of unconventional communication of the write kind. Which, while feeding her vast narcissism and hefty ego, is not necessarily a factual occurrence, or a good thing. Some might look upon her inflated claims as something else.

If attacked by a polar bear, Hick would not drop into the fetal position and cover his head with his arms, as any small child in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada knows to do. He would scream like a woman with her fingers sinking into the back of a warm tomato plucked from the vine, facing a leering green tomato hornworm over the top.

The night his loving wife not only brought him a thin-crust pizza so he could save some of his bowling allowance for auction-going, but also cooked some onions to go on that single-topper. Onions on a foiled Pam-ed pizza pan, baked suitable for pizza garnishing, not sweated, not fried, not microwaved.What did he do, our clue-catching-challenged Hick? He took the foiled pizza pan, scraped the onions onto his pizza, then looked Val directly in the eye, and REMOVED THE FOIL AND CRUNCHED IT INTO A SHINY BALL THE SIZE OF A HERSHEY'S KISS AND THREW IT IN THE TALL KITCHEN WASTEBASKET! In spite of Val standing at the stove, ready to take the pan back, with the oven still on, and a box of breadsticks open on top. In spite of Val giving him a momentary benefit of doubt, thinking he might be using that pizza pan to carry his meal to his La-Z-Boy before bowling departure time, thinking he would simply lay that sheet of foil on the stove top so she could use a different pan for her breadstick-warming needs. But no. Hick put the pizza pan back on the stove and carried his lovingly-onioned pizza on a mere paper plate.WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM? Obviously, Hick's path is broken. The path that Val tries to tele him her wishes through. If Val held out her hands and said, \"Pick a hand, any hand, and maybe you'll win ten dollars for buying MEAT and cake plates at the auction,\" Hick would always pick the wrong hand. His gut instincts are always queasy.I can't even work up enough rage to castigate him anymore. \"Why did you do that?\"\"What?\"\"The foil. I was going to use that on the pan for the breadsticks.\"\"Oh. I saw you looking at me, so I figured I'd better throw away that foil or you'd be mad.\"\"It was perfectly good foil. That stuff's not cheap. I don't see you bringing it home from the auction.\"\"Sorry. I was just cleaning up.\" And with that, he walked from the kitchen to the living room, stepping over the grass clippings that fell off his boots after mowing the yard.I pulled the foil ball out of the trash. Too bad it wasn't laying on top of a once-bitten eclair laying on top of a doily. I pried it apart. Tried to flatten it again. After much exertion, I had a near-square that almost covered two-thirds of the pizza pan. It looked like a project I did in grade school, wrapping wrinkled foil over a rearing plastic horse, then painting him to look like he was made of distressed antique metal.

Because we will be busy partying it up with my septuagenarian aunt on Sunday, I was forced to do my shopping alone. THE HORROR!When I returned home, Hick graced me with his presence. Genius, who made a big show of carrying in groceries one time in front of his houseguest, puts Hick to shame. Hick usually disappears when the restocking wagon rolls into the garage. Today, he came to help. It was obvious that Hick was a novice.He carried bags from the back of T-Hoe through the garage, up the steps, into the kitchen. Silly Hick. Bags go from T-Hoe to side porch. Once they are all on the side porch, they are carried in. This requires only one trip up the steps, not a plethora. When The Pony assists, he keeps bags going into the house as I am fetching them from the garage.Imagine my surprise to find what Hick had done with the bananas. They were in a bag all alone. The Pony would have put them on the counter by the sink, just inside the kitchen door. That's where Hick keeps them. His breakfast staging area, easy to grab on his way out the door for work. But no. Hick carried them all the way around the counter, past the cutting block, to set them on the stove top. But that's not his biggest transgression. Hick was in the kitchen with his bags. I put more on the side porch, and went back for the rest. That's when I heard it: \"JUNO! STAY OUT OF THAT!\"Oh no he didn't! Hick berated my sweet, sweet dog Juno! My sweet silky soulmate who has never, EVER, gotten into the groceries. She might have stepped on the edge of a bag once, trying to get closer to me for petting. But she has NEVER nosed into our foodstuffs. Just the sound of crinkling plastic when her foot hit it made her shy away. And with Juno and Hick on the other side of T-Hoe and the garage wall, Hick had to assert his King of the House power and act like he was saving the groceries from a pillager.What he forgets is that I have done this for more than 20 years without his assistance. Old dogs do not suffer new tricks lightly. It's easier alone.I appreciate the thought. Not the effort. Around here, there's only one correct way to carry in groceries.

A fellow faculty member casually mentioned in line for the two copiers this morning, \"I heard something about you!\"Of course that's a cause for concern. Like when a kid gets called to the principal's office. I immediately cataloged all of my recent transgressions, and wrapped them, like so many fresh fish in newsprint, in excuses. Val is nothing if not a whiz at debate. In fact, she must have been a lawyer in a previous life, what with being long-winded, despised by many, and forever being overruled.\"I hear that you're an author!\" Yeah. I know who let that cat out of the bag. My bestest friend and ex-teaching buddy, Mabel. I have not had time to communicate with her since yesterday. So she has showered her affections on another. When we last convened by text message, I believe Mabel inquired as to where she fit in in my books. I felt that it would be cruel and unusual to offer her a place of honor between the pages, to be pressed and dessicated for keepsake purposes. So I did what my mother always advised me: \"If you can't text anything nice about your bestest friend and ex-teaching buddy, then don't text anything at all.\" I always follow my mother's advice. That's why I'm the $2 Daughter, you know.Oh, horror of horrors, Ms. Heard-Something asked where she could get ahold of one of these books! Of course I told her I could sell her one. Or she can delay her gratification and try Amazon. I think I need to send Mabel out on a publicity tour to promote me. It's not like she's doing anything these days. Heh, heh.If Mabel doesn't like the publicity tour idea, she can hot-trot her heels into the teacher workroom, and start kicking butt and taking names. TWO new Kyoceras from the end of last year, and not a page to print. Both machines were tied up by tremendous stacks of double-sided stapled packets. I left. Not wasting my valuable time standing around a copy machine selling books. When I heard that the Kyoceras had stopped, I went back. Can you believe the one closest to the door was jammed? Yeah. Shocking. And it stayed jammed, even when a student came in and grabbed the done copies.Oh, and Mabel? I outed you as the Copy-Stopper. I could tell by the look on my future customer's face that she had no idea you were the one. All that time, she had been secretly blaming Val. VAL!

They were around 7th grade age, still lanky and not stocky, with fishing poles slung over their shoulders like so many hobo sticks bereft of red bandanas.

He wanted to go to his grandma's house first, to download some game updates using her high-speed internet. Yes, like youth is wasted on the young, high-speed internet is wasted on my mom. Not my fault she can get cable in her neighborhood, and we can't. Mom agreed to meet Hick at the bowling alley at noon to transfer The Pony.On our way to Grandma's, The Pony and I passed a bunch of oncoming traffic on our county road. Most unusual, now that we're no long a major detour. When we got out to the lettered county highway, I saw the reason. An auction. A sign pointed an arrow down our road. Public Auction Today. Of course I called Hick. He loves nothing better than a public auction. Unless it's pushing my buttons.\"Hey. There's a public auction somewhere on our road. We passed a bunch of cars, but the auction must be farther down. The other way from the mailboxes.\"\"Huh. I hadn't heard anything about it. Most public auctions start at ten. It's quarter till. I might go take a look.\" I knew he was beside himself, not knowing ahead of time, to get there at the crack of dawn to scope out treasures. I continued about my business. Dropped off The Pony. Talked to Mom. Shopped at Save A Lot. Picked up a 44 oz. Diet Coke. On the way back, I passed Hick about two miles from home. Not being your regular everyday hillbillies, we did not slam on the brakes and block the road both ways to chat. I called him.\"Why are you going so early? Bowling isn't for 45 minutes.\"\"I'm going to town to see if my chainsaw is fixed. I went by the auction, and they're not selling anything I'm interested in until 2:00. The Pony should be done by then.\"The guys arrived home after 2:30. The Pony came directly to my office. \"How was bowling?\"\"Oh, we didn't bowl today. Just registered and got on teams. Dad and I both ate lunch there. Then he made me go to the auction with him.\"\"I guess he didn't get what he wanted? You're home pretty early.\"\"He got a box of stuff. He's taking it now to wherever he keeps that stuff.\"\"What did he get?\"\"Some trays. And a drink dispenser.\"I know that Hick collects Falstaff, and various other brands of beer memorabilia, to display in his BARn. When The Pony mentioned drink dispenser, I knew he wasn't talking about a SodaStream. I imagined a cut-glass decanter with an ornate stopper. Something not quite Hick's style. But since he DOES buy fancy cake plates because he swears my mom loves them, I could imagine him dropping a few dollars on a decanter.\"Drink dispenser? Like a fancy glass bottle with a stopper?\"\"Um. No. I can't describe it.\"\"How hard is it to tell me what a drink dispenser looks like? I might want you to get a picture of it for me.\"\"No. You don't want that. It was...in the shape of...uh...a BOY. And I'm not going to tell you where the drink comes out.

Like every rose has its thorn, every night has its dawn, and every cowboy sings a sad, sad song...Val attracts weirdos with the force of an electromagnet hoisting a compacted clunker onto the scrap heap. No trip to town goes unweirdoed.Today, for instance. All I wanted was a 44 oz. Diet Coke from the gas station chicken store. A simple wish, really. Nothing extravagant. Nothing extraordinary. My chosen parking spot beckoned to me. The lot was only one-third as full of cars as last evening. And a family of ten or so sat outside at the round picnic tables where that one weirdo laid her lit cigarette on the seat, then found it on the ground and still put it in her mouth. So I figured the inner sanctum of my close-quartered convenience store would be relatively uncrowded.Just then two men and a woman, all sporting tattoos on their various and assorted exposed appendages, strode past me to the door. Okay. Three people. That they looked like soda-buyers did not deter me from my mission. They appeared harmless enough. Like Fleetwood Mac concertgoers from the late 70s. Before TUSK. I don't believe in foreshadowing, but rather in misdirection. They were not the weirdos.As I stepped through the door, I quickly realized that I will never be kicked out of a casino for counting cards. While I had imagined that the number of people outside the store divided by the number of cars on the parking lot would yield a favorable ratio of in-store competition for the clerks' attention, I was sadly mistaken. Quite sadly. Like when you split and double down, and the dealer hits 21. The line ran from the counter all the way past the chicken-ordering area, past the Pepsi dispenser, past the Coke dispenser, past the iced tea dispenser, past the hot chocolate/cappuccino dispenser, to the coolers along the back wall. I strolled down the middle aisle, and stood waiting with my elbow on a stack of royal blue cases of Busch.The chubbier of the two tattooed dudes meandered across the back, carrying two individual bottles of beer. I didn't know they sold singles. Except for those giant tall cans that the workingmen buy in the evening. Chubs started to join his two compatriots, then noticed me. \"Oh. I'm sorry. Go ahead.\"\"That's okay. I'm waiting for the line to get to the soda machine.\" He stepped in front of me, and kissed his long-braided girlfriend. The line moved slowly. I rounded the bend. Refilled my cup with ice and the magical elixir that is Diet Coke.  The Rumours crew had stopped for chicken. I was stuck in line between the backs of the chicken people on my left, and the shelves of bottled liquor on the right. In front of me stood a bony 20-something in dirty jeans and a faded blue t-shirt topped by a mesh glowy orange roadworker vest. Several folks were ahead of him, engaging the two cashiers, the fast friendly girl who only works once in a blue moon now, and the tall black-haired man with one tooth who aspires to be a factory worker. I knew they would clear it out as quickly as possible. The problem seemed to be an older guy trying to pay for gas and buy PowerBall with his own number picks. Something wasn't working. Something like his credit card. So he got out some more. He apologized for the trouble, and the clerk apologized for the inconvenience.The weirdo entered. And was immediately attracted to me. Like sophomore boys to free food, toddlers to sharp implements, and Hick to a public auction.She sported bleached blond hair, and a bloated face like a sometimes alcoholic. I would put her age well into the forties. Her clothing, though I could not get a good look, what with the sardining of the patrons, would have been along the lines of bikini-line cut-off frayed jean shorts, and a pastel, tangerine-colored halter top. She broad-shouldered her way through the crowd, swimming upstream until she mistook me for bait.\"Is this the line?\" She directed the question to me alone.\"Yes.\" Just the facts. Nothing more. I had no desire to engage.\"Seriously?\" She peered into my face from a distance of about three inches. I had very little room to recoil, what with fifteen flavors of schnapps on the elbow-height shelf beside me. I resisted her attempt to draw me in. She wasn't getting any embellishment from me.\"Are you freakin' serious?\" Something told me that she did not regard it as a rhetorical question. But that's how I treated it.\"Seriously.\" More of a statement. A judgment on the length of the line in the gas station chicken store. The liners behind me must have been boring into her conscience with their eyes. She finally brushed past me and the Rumours crew like a novice St. Bernard twining through the weave poles at a canine agility competition.Ser-i-ous-ly. What am I, the spokesman for the Waiting Your Turn In Convenience Stores Board? What else could she have been thinking? I wish I'd had the nerve to tell her:\"Nope. I'm not serious. Just pulling your Naired, Coppertone Q-T-ed leg. This is not really the line. Thirty of my close friends and I decided to pull a prank on you. When we saw you turn onto the parking lot, we all hustled in here and packed ourselves around the aisles and counter so you would have to wedge your way in. Ha ha! We're not even buying these things. We already had them when we walked in. I just love a good prank. If only somebody could get the security camera footage, we could put it on YouTube. Go right on up front.

We headed off to a nearby town after school in search of the elusive Samsung power cord. I had my personal Pony assistant call my mom, who was going to meet us by the park to pick up my last week's tabloids. Drug deals occur there less frequently that dry goods exchanges between Mom and me. \"Oh, and tell her she can ride along with us to the computer store.\"\"Grandma says she's just wearing her old clothes. Is that all right?\"\"Sure. She won't have to get out anywhere.\"\"Okay. She's going.\"We picked her up and embarked on our quest for the elusive computer store. \"I can't remember the name. It starts with a Z or a D. And it's two words. It's between the Auto Zone and Commerce Bank.\" Well. I drove by in rush hour traffic, and there was no building between Auto Zone and a different bank chain. We were meandering all round the back of town. \"Well, I don't know where it is. We've come all this way and can't find it.\"\"Do you have a phone number?\"\"No. I thought you said you didn't want a universal charger. So I didn't write it down.\"The Pony shouted out the name. Seems he had Googled the town and \"computer store\" on his old laptop, and discovered that instead of being on West Backroads Boulevard, the shop was on East Backroads Boulevard. We found it between a NAPA Auto Parts and a Commerce Bank. Yeah. Amundsen and Scott, seekers of the South Pole, had nothing on us. Though I'm sure The Pony breathed a sigh of relief that we did not run short of food.But that's not the crux of this story. It's merely the set-up. After buying a power cord, we headed to Arby's. I asked Mom to go in with me to help carry. The Pony chose to wait in the car. I ordered a round of the five for $5.00 junior sandwiches. Two rounds, in fact. Ten sandwiches. And that clerk had the nerve to ask, \"For here or to go.\" Yeah. Suicide by faux roast beef.But that's not the crux of this story. I parked across two parking spaces. They're small. And one was against the side curb where the drive-thru vehicles exit. Mom was a bit reluctant to go inside. \"Oh, I'm wearing these old pants with the hole in the knee. I guess I can let my purse dangle down in front of it.\" Let the record show that she had on some kind of dark heather gray stretchy kind of pants with a small snag less than the size of a quarter at one knee. Not at all noticeable. And her egg-yolk-yellow t-shirt had nothing wrong with it.Of course while we were waiting by the soda machine after getting The Pony a root beer, a work colleague of my sister approached Mom to chat. You remember my sister, right? The wife of the ex-mayor? She just retired. She took Mom out for ice cream yesterday, though Mom asserted that SHE was the one who paid, like that canceled out the good-deededness of the outing.And now, we're getting closer to the crux of this story. Mom was beside herself that she ran into somebody who knew her. Never mind that everyplace Mom goes, she runs into somebody who knows her. She's the Norm of the Backroads community. So what does Mom do, when talking to this friend of my sister? \"Oh! I'm so embarrassed. I didn't plan to get out of the car. Or see anyone I knew. I usually don't look like this. This is terrible. Look! I've even got a hole in my pants!\" She moved the purse. Bent her knee at a hole-flattering angle. The friend assured her that it was fine. That she didn't even notice. She had only wanted to say hello.We grabbed our provisions and left, stepping out into the sunlight and judgmental gazes on our way to the two parking spaces. When we got back to the car, Mom started laughing. \"That always happens to me! I should never have come with you like this.\"\"You know, it might not have been as noticeable if you hadn't followed her to the counter, yelling, 'Look at this hole in my pants! I've got a big hole in my pants. I'm so embarrassed by this hole in my pants.' All while swinging that purse around and sticking your knee up like a drum majorette.\"\"Oh! Stop! We always do this! Now you've got me tickled.\"I headed back to our rendezvous point. \"Do you want anything, Mom? A soda to go with your sandwiches? There's Sonic. A Diet Cherry Coke?\"\"No. I don't need anything.\"\"Well, I'm going to pull in there anyway. And make you get out, and parade up and down in front of both sides of cars, shouting, 'Hole in my pants! Hole in my pants! Looky here! I've got a hole in my pants!' Next time I'm going to call you early in the morning. Hey, Mom. Come ride with me. No need to change out of your pajamas. And I might accidentally catch my finger in the steering wheel, and need to stop by the ER for x-rays, and you'll need to go in with me, of course...Here comes the crux of this story. Inside Arby's, Mom had waved a ten-dollar bill and asked me if I had a five. No. She said, \"I was going to give you some money, but all I have is a ten. Do you have a five in the car?\" No. Next thing I knew, Mom went out to ask The Pony what kind of soda he wanted, and when she came back, she had TWO DOLLARS folded up in her hand, and she shoved them in my shirt pocket. And even though there was mention of me possibly getting change after my purchase, after all that pants-hole camaraderie, MOM DID NOT GIVE ME ONE MORE RED CENT!That, my friends, is the crux of this story.

It's really hard to give directions right to our front door. Traffic virtually stopped while we gathered them into T-Hoe. They shared the second seat next to The Pony, since my purse, bubba cup, and school bag were taking up space on the shotgun seat.

Was somebody (I'm thinking about YOU, Madam) thrusting hatpins into a voodoo doll of my likeness? The pain took my breath away. I was virtually incapacitated. So I called my mom. Using my left hand, of course.\"Oh, honey! Do you want me to drive out there? I don't know if there's anything I can do. But I'll try.\"\"No. I can't think, the pain is so bad. It takes my breath away. OW! I can't even move a little bit. I have to get where it doesn't hurt, and freeze. It hurts so bad I want to cry. And I have to do the Walmart shopping this morning.\"\"Oh, cry! Cry. That might make it feel better. It can't hurt any worse. Why don't you rub some ActivOn on it? Can I meet you at Walmart and put things in your cart for you? And help you unload it at home?\"\"Nooooo. I have The Pony. But I think I will try that ActivOn, if I can grip it to get the lid off.\" Aha! That's my mom's new cure-all. ActivOn. One of her old-lady friends recommended it. I took her to Walmart and found a box of it. Actually, it comes in a little plastic round dispenser like a glue stick. Looks like glue, too. The clear kind. I used some on my lower arm one day, and it worked. So I tried it on my newest ailment, even though the pain of it pressing against my flesh was almost unbearable.By the time I got home from shopping, the pain was almost gone! It was a miracle! I assure you, I do not have blood like pure Rocky Mountain spring water. That's what Robby Benson's roommate said about him after giving him a pill to make him play better, in the best basketball movie ever, One on One, written by Robby Benson himself and his very own dad, back when Robby was at the height of his cuteness. Here's a bad clip to give you a taste.Nor do I have blood that is pharmaceutical soup, like what I imagine runs through Keith Richards's veins.I have Goldilocks blood that is just right for absorbing that ActivOn and ridding me of horrendous, debilitating pain.If only all of my ailments were so receptive to treatment. One thing's for sure. A little dose of late '70s Robby Benson can't hurt."}, {"title": "Hello Tunnel Vision My Old Friend", "date": "Monday, September 2, 2013", "text": "What festivities did Val have on her calendar for this Labor Day weekend? Nothing much. No annual picnic with lemonade and greased flagpoles and a baseball game between the men of Backroads and Walnut Grove. Nope.The day dawned bright and early at 7:45. Have I mentioned that I'm a night owl? First on the agenda was laundry. I tossed in a load of The Pony's school shirts. He doesn't have a uniform. It was just the shirts that are not faded, stained, or snagged. The ones I hang around the laundry room to dry.Did I tell you that The Pony was sick last week? He even missed last Saturday with his grandma, until he was sufficiently noncontagious by this Friday to spend the night. He dumped those togs in the laundry basket Saturday night when he returned. I tossed them in the washer this morning, including his school pants from Friday, and a couple of pairs of my granny panties and black socks. Sorry to burst your PG-13-rated thought bubbles, guys. I hate to be the one to break the news that not all of the fairer sex wear butt floss for foundation garments. Nor do we host weekly topless slumber party pillow fights, or settle our differences with tops-ripped-off, eye-clawing catfights.Imagine my consternation when I went to retrieve those clean clothes from the washer, and found the entire lot dotted with wet tissue particles. It appears that The Pony's snotty snoot had cleared enough that he did not need to use his pocket tissues to wipe it during school hours. I have not gone through that boy's pockets since about third grade, when The Pony was not-heaven-bent on bringing home the playground 50 pebbles at a time.I called my little Pony to the laundry room. \"Grab those clothes and start peeling the tissue off them. Get the kitchen wastebasket.\" He did an admirable job. The only casualty was a pair of my grannies, which I dropped into the wastebasket while shaking. For some reason, The Pony found this hilarious. So I told him when he was done, he needed to get the broom and dustpan from the crack between the washer and the wall, and sweep up the tissue particles that covered the gray ceramic tile floor.Please do not judge me when I reveal that The Pony grabbed those cleaning implements, and said, \"I never knew we had this broom!\" Teenage boys are simply unaware of what goes on behind the scenes to provide them with a roof under which to eat sandwiches and lay around turning their spine to jelly. I cautioned him not to shake that dustpan so the tissues flew back onto the floor. Keep it over the wastebasket. Or open the laundry room door and dump it on the porch, where it could blow away.I called my mom for sympathy. She's usually great for making me feel better like that. I thought she might offer to drive out and pick the tissue from the clean laundry, and I could magnanimously declare, \"Oh, you don't have to do that! You do so much for us already.\" But no. Do you know what she said?\"Why didn't you just step out on the back porch and shake them?\"What kind of a genius is SHE? All these years, hiding her MENSA card, refusing to pass down those genes to her $8 daughter. She is probably at this very moment negotiating a contract with the feds for the rights to her perpetual motion machine, and awaiting a patent on her better mousetrap.My valedictorianship pales in comparison."}, {"title": "Bleach's Pet", "date": "Sunday, September 1, 2013", "text": "I fear that my rescue-pup-now-adolescent-doggie Juno and I are growing apart.Several mornings last week, she did not run along the porch for petting as The Pony and I headed off to school. And when we returned home, she did not always run to the garage door, sneak in for a mouthful of Meow Mix, stop the garage door from closing as her getaway trot tripped the sensor, and magically appear on the porch for a hug. I know that her black borador fur is a warm coat for this sweltering weather. I don't begrudge her more time in the hollowed-out dust bowl under The Pony's truck beside the garage.We used to be so close. Twice-a-day sweet nothings. Fur pressed to flesh. Loving gazes from her amber eyes to my hazel. Juno actively jockeying for position, physically broadcasting that no fleabags need aspire to the stroke of Val's palm, so that Tank the beagle and Ann the shepherd had to hang back from the porch edge, lest they be shouldered into the sidewalk abyss.On Thursday, Juno lay on the porch and watched me come out of the garage and up the steps! She made no move to receiver her lovin'. And ANN WAS CLOSER TO ME THAN SHE WAS!I ran the past week through my mind. Had I upset her sweet, sweet nature? Ignored her advances? Shunned her unknowingly? No. I had not. It was her, not me.Last night at 11:30, I stepped out the basement door to pour out the life fluid of D'Hummi, the dehumidifier. And there was Juno! She was shoulder high, laying on the deck of Poolio, in the corner formed by the railing. She turned to look over her shoulder at me. I could almost hear her saying...You know when George Costanza thought he had a heart attack, and was laying in that hospital bed, and said that Jerry should just kill him now, so Jerry pushed a pillow onto his face just as Elaine came through the door, and said fakely, \"Elaine! What are YOU doing here?\"Yeah. I could hear Juno's doggy brain telepathing such a question to me. \"Val! What are YOU doing here?\"She trotted down the pool deck steps and came across the flat rocks to me in the alcove by the basement door. Of course I petted her. Leaned over to hug her as best I could. Then I told her it was almost midnight. That I needed to pour a bit of bleach into D'Hummi's gullet to keep him fresh. So she should go back to bed. I'd see her in the morning. Juno leaned against my leg. I stroked her silky side. Then I grabbed the bleach jug and twisted off the cap. Juno stuck her head up under my shirt to put her wet nose on my belly. She likes to do that when my hands are busy. Like when I'm tossing stale bread to the chickens off the front porch.I think we're besties again."}, {"title": "Glass and Bugs Just Go Together", "date": "Saturday, August 31, 2013", "text": "Hey! You know that saying, \"Sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug?\" Yeah. I like it, because it's so Even Steveny.Can you imagine what it would be like if you really were a windshield? If eyes are the windows to the soul, then windshields are the windows from the driver's soul-windows to the outside of the car. Not quite so poetic, eh?If you were a windshield, you wouldn't have to wipe yourself. There are contraptions to do that for you, and folks like the occasional full-service gas station attendant like those at a certain establishment in Backroads that hires the ex-cons, who don't use a cash register but instead carry the money in a long wallet on a chain, because who's going to mess with an ex-con to get that cash, anyway, because even though ex-conny may have a heart of gold, he is still what we lily-livered pantywaist educators consider hard-core.Yes, if you were a windshield, people would do their darnedest to keep you crystal clear. Not foggy. Might even give you a drink of Coca Cola every now and then. Shade you with metallic plastic springy contraptions in the heat. Cover you with cardboard on frosty nights. Give you a birdpoopectomy the instant your illness was diagnosed.If you were a bug, on the other hand, you could fly. Around and around people's heads, buzzing them like an old-timey crop duster after an alleged spy. You could walk on the surface of water. Treat other people's bodies like an amusement park. Sail on saliva in a cavernous mouth like it's the tunnel of love. Explore the ear canal funhouse. Break a leg...heck, have one pulled from its socket, and walk without a crutch. WAIT! What I really wanted to share with you was that I set The Pony to gathering some creek water yesterday morning, and snipping some leaves off a tree, for my microscope-using lab. The students were buzzing around, looking at prepared slides, like honeybee mouth parts and housefly legs, and ones I had made with crushed leaves, and weed pollen, and creek water...when I saw them.BUGS!The miniscule hitchhikers were in the Ziploc bag with the leaves. Tiny red bugs marching along the serrated edges. Tiny red bugs. Clingy. I tied to shake some onto a piece of printer paper. Knocked that leaf on it with a vengeance. Pried a couple off with a pencil lead. Wouldn't you know it? Each time I tried to pick one up on the pencil point and deposit it on a slide for dousing with a pipette-drop of water before sealing it with a cover slip...that darn bug would disintegrate into a red stain. At first I suspected they were chiggers, but I think chiggers are a hardier lot. Oh, and there was also a tiny thin gray leggy spider. He was kind of twisted, but I rehydrated him and flattened him forthwith.Yeah! Who knew we would end up with bonus bugs? Kudos to The Pony for his selection techniques. Sometimes you're the windshield. Sometimes you're the bug.And sometimes, you're pressed in a drop of water between a cover slip and a slide."}, {"title": "Val Continues To Depreciate", "date": "Friday, August 30, 2013", "text": "Oh, how my stock has fallen!

At least not at that instant. And she shoved those bills down into my 44 oz. cup!Let the record show that it was not a malicious act. She was not trying to slice a leak, thus depriving me of my single daily pleasure. I had already put ten twenties in there. The bank refused to take them as a deposit! What's the world coming to, when you can't deposit cash into someone's account if you don't know their account number? It's not like I'm a Nigerian scammer. Genius needs his monthly allowance. The drive-thru teller's excuse was that there have been too many complaints about money being deposited in the wrong accounts. Seriously? I'm betting the account-holders were not the ones complaining. What's up with that? Is everybody dumping money into John Smith's account? Now I have to go back to the bank tomorrow with a deposit slip. Oh, and I also had to put three deposit receipts from my savings&loan in there. As well as two receipts from the credit union. But that didn't mean Mom could jam four ones in there indiscriminately.

I don't want to hurt corporate business. People need to keep buying gas and driving to Arby's for their chicken salad sandwich fix. I, however, shall have my homemade Val's Chicken Salad Nearwich. Here's how it goes:First you cube or shred a leftover boneless chicken breast that you baked on Tuesday. It should have no seasonings on it, because you ran out of lemon pepper, and in the heat of the moment shook a little garlic salt and fresh-ground pepper onto Hick's portion, but left yours unadorned. Next, you take a half-full bag of whole pecans that your mom gave you last Christmas to make Chex Mix with off the top shelf of your freezer, shake a few onto your Everyday China, and cut them into thirds.Then you find the bag of Granny Smith apple slices that you bought last Sunday on the bottom shelf of Frig, where that bag somehow opened itself and disgorged half its contents to parts unknown, then lay back with its top open like some common tart. Dice about eight slices to the size of dice. You know. The gambling thingies that teachers have to call \"number cubes.\"Dump these three ingredients into a recycled Dairy Queen Grilled Chicken Salad black plastic bowl. Notice that it's not big enough, and pour the contents into your favorite smallest brown plastic mixing bowl. Sprinkle on about a sixth of an envelope of Hidden Valley Ranch Dip powder left over from seasoning the vegetables in a pot roast two weeks ago. Grind some fresh black pepper out of the silver bullet pepper grinder that your bestest friend and ex-teaching buddy Mabel gave you one Christmas.Shake around those damp dry ingredients. Add several dollops of Kraft mayonnaise. NOT Miracle Whip! Shake in one packet of Splenda. Stir the whole kit 'n' caboodle with one of your serving spoons that have all been deformed by the men of the house ignoring the three ice cream scoops.Serve on Oat Nut bread, which is a poor substitute for the Market Fresh tasty hearty wheaty multigrain stuff.Enjoy!"}, {"title": "Dainty Val Discusses a Delicate Matter", "date": "Wednesday, August 28, 2013", "text": "This afternoon I was waiting for The Pony to get out of his once-a-week after-school Algebra II lesson review.

Hick has been popping Z-packs and old-timey antibiotics like they're sugar-free candy. He has bronchitis. The Pony came down with a bug on Saturday. He tells me, in a raspy voice, between fits of coughing, that he feels much better now.So this afternoon, I was catching up on some future work, sneezing every time the air conditioner kicked on, blowing my stuffy nose, clearing my throat, and I started to feel a bit...um...indisposed.

I didn't have a moment to spare. I ducked into the workroom before he passed the office. Locked my door behind me, and ensconced myself on the throne.Dear me. What a predicament. The nature of my...um...indisposement left me vulnerable. One could only hope that Lunch Brother was hard of hearing. Oh, he came in. I heard his footsteps. I heard the tinkle of change, and the thud of the beverage machine. But then I heard nothing. Was he waiting? To chew the fat? Shoot the breeze? I certainly hoped not. I was not comfortable doing my business with him on the other side of one thin concrete-block wall and wooden door. Like Jerry separated from Kramer's boys by one thin layer of gabardine, I was a bit freaked out. And so was the Febreze Air Effects Hawaiian Aloha.There was no holding back my...um...indisposition.

I figured it was a book that had shipped separately from my last order.I have been PG-13-cursing that book for two weeks. It is in the way of the stuff I throw on that seat. It's no skin off The Pony's soft, soft nose. He doesn't ride there. I thought he'd take a hint and carry my package inside. He's had two weeks, you know.Sunday afternoon, The Pony said, \"What book IS that, anyway?\"\"I don't know. I didn't even open it because it would be more awkward with those flaps sticking out.\" Surely you don't think I'd throw away the cardboard if I won't even carry in a book.The Pony ripped that package open. \"It's The Adventure Time Encyclopedia!

The parents can eat inside, soaking up the air-conditioning while watching the kiddies play through the front windows. Or they can sit outside with them.Across a strip of parking lot from the barred playground, there's a well-maintained section of grass that merges up on the stoplight and road right-of-way.

Still, Hick suffered punishment enough, what with missing out on ten minutes more with his boy home from college.We heard tales of survival concerning mysterious laundry spots, dining hall rip-offs, an overabundance of mini-fridges, the upcoming honors banquet, and next weekend's electrical engineering ersatz Easter-egg hunt with radio transmitters instead of eggs.

I didn't see it until around 2:00 a.m. But my pajama buttons were bursting with pride.Of course, I don't know what a floor governor is. Perhaps it's a drunken public official who can no longer stand. A floor governor. Or one who makes sure hallways are swept, common carpet areas vacuumed, and toilet tiles scrubbed. A floor governor. Whatever the case, I am pleased as punch. The good kind. With sherbet and pineapple juice and 7-UP and mini marshmallows.After a request for further information, perhaps in his first formal response as an elected official, Genius informed me that he did not campaign for the position per se, but let it be known that he was running for the office. He gave a speech. And was elected. Apparently, there are five floor governors per 100 people. That's a lot of drinkin', or a lot of clean floorage. Genius will attend residence hall meetings to voice the concerns of his constituents, and have his finger in the till regarding the distribution of dormitory funds. He will assist in organizing activities for his fellow residents. Like a party planner!His grandma is puffed with pride as well. I could feel her smile beaming through the land-line.

It's about time for another woeful tale from the annals of Val's life. But this one is very recent history. Hot off the calendar. Twelve hours old. Not even ready to be termed \"day old\" and set on the counter at half price.Perhaps I've mentioned what a great help The Pony is when he accompanies me on the weekly shopping trip. He's a real go-getter. I tell him several items I need, and he goes and gets them. Kind of like a scavenger hunt with no prize, and he's the only participant. This week, I sent him for a giant bottle of Germ-X, three packages of neon index cards, baby wipes, a three-pack of Puffs With Aloe, and a can of Febreze. We don't go though those every week here at the old homestead. Those items were for my classroom.Have I clued you in that The Pony is a real go-getter, but lacks the quality control gene? He grabs shelf stock without inspecting it for flaws. Yes, The Pony has a penchant for picking up the most damaged goods in each section. I almost had hope this week, when he returned to my cart, about which he orbits like a satellite, to tell me that the plastic containers of baby wipes were all stove-in. I sent him back for the plain ones. My white board isn't getting diaper rash any time soon. Yes, I almost had hope. But there it was, at the end of the evening, as I sat back in my basement recliner and reached for my National Enquirer: a rip about halfway down the second page. I hadn't noticed at first, due to the folded-down edge at the corner.The school accessories lolled about T-Hoe's rear end until this morning. No use carrying stuff in the house that will be carried right back out. This morning we had time to take it into my classroom. And by we, I mean The Pony. He packed that stuff in right quick. Left it on the first row of desks.I grabbed the Febreze out of the gray plastic bag, and put it on the next-to-top shelf of my cabinet. Hmm...that didn't smell like Febreze. I hefted the Germ-X through the top of the crinkly plastic, and put it beside the Febreze. Then I carried the bag with the three packs of neon index cards to my desk. That was all we brought in this morning, besides my usual school bag. Just the necessities. Let the record show that teachers are germ-free, non-smelly, and bright.I thrust my arm elbow-deep into the crinkly sack to retrieve the neon index cards. Something was seriously amiss! My delicate sense of touch screamed with indignity. There was goo in that bag. Like the viscous gel that buffers Vienna Sausages from the cylindrical walls of their pop-top metal prison. But this goo was more bereft of meat than even the Vienna Sausages. The Pony had selected a giant bottle of Germ-X that some wily customer had seen fit to screw with, thus enabling the push-spout. Unsafe for transport in a shapeless plastic bag.I set out my neon index cards onto my desk, pack by pack. Grabbed one of my remaining Puffs (with aloe) to wipe it down like a momma Clydesdale's tongue cleaning her newborn commercial-destined foal. The first two were unslimed without incident. The third time was not a charm. That last package of neon index cards eluded my grasp like an overtired toddler refusing to have his face polished clean of melted chocolate. It squirted through my palms faster than a greased pig at an Iowa county fair contest. But without squealing, and lacking that cute curly tail. It was recaptured near my left foot, and swiped clean of its clear antibacterial coat.

A side trip to garner more education for myself, in order to bring even more smarts to the future citizens of our great land.I rented an apartment in Springfield, Missouri, to use as my home base. I worked at the best junk store ever, and attended classes to complete my Master's degree. I kept odd hours between work and school. Sometimes I worked nine-hour shifts, some weekdays I was off, and I was back and forth to the college library on an irregular basis.Imagine my surprise and consternation upon arriving home one evening to find my front door ajar. Creepy, to say the least. I pushed it open. Thought for a minute that I'd forgotten to pull it shut tight enough. Until I saw the bent metal around the door frame. I called inside. There was no sound, so I went in.The wires to my new VCR were hanging out the front of my particle-board entertainment center. That hit me like a punch in the gut. MY VCR WAS GONE! And along with it, the first VHS tape I ever bought: Aliens! Ooh! The injustice!I called the police. Told them I wanted to report a robbery. The dispatcher asked if the thief was still there. No. That would be crazy, a thief letting me call the police. The point he was trying to make was that I was actually reporting a burglary. Not a robbery. Potato, potahto. Get somebody over here.As I waited, I noticed how cold the apartment felt. It was fall. The heat was running. But I was cold. A look in the kitchen revealed the reason. My sliding glass door to the fenced-in patio was open. I left it. In case the cop wanted fingerprints, you know.He didn't. A real cop is not like a TV cop. He looked at the front door. Saw the pry marks. Looked on the patio. \"It looks like the guy came in the front using a screwdriver on the door. He grabbed what he wanted, and probably balanced it right here on the corner of the fence. The he hopped over when he was ready to leave. I'll bet they've been watching this complex.\"Yeah. I had seen a guy loitering around the corner near our parking lot. This was before cell phones. They must have had walkie-talkies. Since we were situated on a dead end, the accomplice knew that once I drove out, his guy had time to ransack until the accomplice notified him to get out, because my car was returning. Quite a set-up. I'm always suspicious of loiterers now.The most embarrassing part was telling that handsome young policeman that nothing else had been taken. That the only thing I had worth stealing was a VCR.No. The MOST embarrassing part was when that handsome young policeman said, \"I see he ransacked your spare bedroom, too.\" Um. No. I'm a slob. I had clothes strewn all over the spare bed.But I didn't tell him that. That darn ransacker!

No, I don't have halitosis, body odor, stinky feet, or feel less than fresh. I don't smell, as in give off a scent.

You know that grandma-grandson look. How she adores him! \"Is that good. Mmm...mmm. Is your tummy getting full?\" And she made that sound like a grandma makes to represent tasting something tasty. Kind of smacking her lips in an imitation of eating.\"You know they can hear everything you say, right?\" I put my deposit in the pneumatic tube canister thingy.

Accusations bounce off me, and stick to...everyone else.When we returned to the old salt mines Monday, the teacher workroom greeted us with a small table piled high with toner cartridges. I was impressed enough to suck in my breath in wonder. Boxes of toner cartridges are scarce as hens' teeth when the Kyocera starts fading. But here they were. Like a banquet laid out for a queen. If her royal highness felt a mite peckish for stacks of cardboard stuffed with dark powder encased in plastic. There was no time to take pictures of each other standing beside Mt. Toner with our smart phones. Every minute was accounted for that day, along with fifteen of them squeezed into overtime territory like rolls of muffin-top flesh over a denim waistband.We worked in our rooms Tuesday. Talk about the state of education these days...nobody even had time to pop in and gossip. I'm surprised our noses didn't wear out the grindstone. I, myself, stayed in for lunch to catch up on my paperwork while watching two mandated online videos with one eye. It was during that time I received a call from the office, inquiring as to whether I was the one who OPENED EVERY CARTRIDGE BOX. Which was a problem, you see, because then nobody could tell which cartridges were fresh, and which had been bled dry yet replaced in a box for recycling or disposal purposes.To borrow a line and title from Shaggy, \"It wasn't me.\"There was no further questioning. Perhaps I was the only one in the building to call when the heinous act was discovered. Perhaps something in my tone portended danger, or innocence. Perhaps it was an effort to make me sing like a canary and turn in my fellow faculty. Or MAYBE they suddenly realized that I was not exactly toner-cartridge-replacer material.I swear, if I was the last woman on Earth, and wanted to make a copy of my own ample buttocks for personal viewing, I would never attempt to replace a toner cartridge in a Kyocera. Or any copier, for that matter. Nobody wants a five o'clock shadow on their midsection, even with nobody else left on Earth to see it. Besides, those toner cartridges require a workout more strenuous than an English Channel swim rolled up in an Iron Man triathlon rolled up in an Olympic marathon. Toner cartridges must be shaken, not babied like a tube of nitroglycerin transported through the Badlands on horseback.Did I open eleventy-thousand boxes of toner cartridges?

And besides, the pool of tears would have risen up to thwart their maximum oxygen uptake.

It was through the living room window that I spotted him climb out of the Gator, and sensed something amiss.I couldn't quite put my finger on it. Something to do with apparel. Hick is not known for wearing plain white T-shirts. They always have a logo on the left chest. Or a word emblazoned across the front. This one was plain. Yet there was some funky fancy stitchwork around the sleeves. A gray strip along the back of the neck. Then I knew. It was one of those Starter shirts that wick away moisture. They're really very cool for the wearer. Genius has them in many colors. He used to use them for basketball practice, and to mow his grandma's yard. The Pony has several himself. Most notably, The Pony has about five of those shirts in white. They're like a uniform to him in the summer, because no matter what shorts he pairs them with, he's fashionable. I knew that Hick would not fit into The Pony's shirts. Then I remembered that I had bought him one to work at a junior-class fundraiser at Busch stadium in the heat of last summer.That gray strip is what tipped me off. Those shirts don't have a gray strip. Except on the inside.Hick was wearing his shirt inside out.As soon as he came in, saying he was ready to leave, I told him. He denied it at first.

Put in the cherry flavoring. Add Sprite.\" He refused to use one of my 44 oz. cups, even thought it meant an $.80 charge rather than a $1.20 charge. Oh, well. It's less spending money available for him in college. I spied a dispenser for pink lemonade, and added that to give it a sour kick. Like limeade. Only lemony. And pink. But I figured the cherry would camouflage the pinkness.He liked it! He really liked it! But the next day, he commanded me to find a tiny plastic hollow lime ca[able of squirting lime juice. And to get a 44 oz. drink. Made the same way, of course, because it was good, it just needed lime. He could not do this himself, because he did not know what I put in. And he could not use one of my refill cups, because around the top they had a slight discoloration from the lid clamping Diet Coke into the styrofoam. Shh...we keep extra cups in T-Hoe. I carried out one cup, mine, he thought, and The Pony handed me another one in the car. Voila! Refill price.Three days now, and I've been looking like a two-fisted 44-ounce drinker. Wouldn't you know it, today the Voice of the Village was out of cherry flavoring. But I pumped that several-gallon plastic jar for all I was worth, and gathered enough cherry nectar to suffice. Oh, and they were out of long straws. But that didn't really matter, because THEY WERE ALSO OUT OF DIET COKE! I had to drive to the gas station chicken store for MY refill. So I got him a straw there.Now if I could just stop him from throwing away his cup every day..."}, {"title": "Maybe He Wants a Newsboy Cap for Christmas", "date": "Tuesday, August 6, 2013", "text": "Genius is off to college Saturday. The end of an era. He is milking the situation for all he can get.This morning he came up with the cockamamie idea that I should make him a big going-away breakfast. I know where he got that inspiration, and I can't thank that Madam enough. I was, however, able to talk him down from the omelet, Belgian waffle, rasher of bacon, and  freshly-squeezed orange juice ledge. Especially since that might require him to arise five minutes earlier to have time to eat. He says he will accept Martha White instant strawberry/blueberry muffins instead, on Thursday.Genius declared that he should have a special meal of his choosing. Tonight. Never mind that he's getting a going-away steak restaurant dinner on Friday. You'd think he was a death-penalty inmate with three sentences, the way he's cashing in on last meals. Did he ask for a banquet of Val's specialties? A spread of pot roast, towering vegetable beef soup, Chex mix, deviled eggs, potato salad, garlic cheese bread, cheddar Bisquick biscuits, and Oreo cake alongside graham cracker crust chocolate pudding pie with Cool Whip topping? No. That boy is certainly no gourmet. He wanted Chef Boyardee boxed pizza mix baked deep-dish style. With hamburger on top. When he finished in three minutes, he said, \"That was certainly worth the two hours it took you to make it.\" Haha. He knows it was only one hour and change.This morning he stumbled out of bed as I was channel surfing. \"Is that NEWSIES? You've GOT to watch it!\"Seriously. There's a reason that movie cost $15 million to make, and grossed $2 million. I could not help but provide commentary throughout. If you've never seen the movie, let me spare you two hours of your life. Christian Bale is Jack, the head newsboy. He has a line about how headlines have to be catchy, have certain words that are sure to sell papers. Words like maniac, corpse, love-nest, or nude. He gets the idea for newsboys to strike, after selling papers with bad headlines like, \"Trolley Strike Drags on for Third Week,\" and seeing how determined the trolley workers are.At one point, Jack, who dreams of moving to Santa Fe, and goes by the nickname \"Cowboy,\" steals a horse. He rides it down the street, singing one of the many bad songs in this musical, then jumps off and slaps it on the rump. The horse runs off camera, in the direction of a fire that was earlier attributed to violence from the trolley strike. I couldn't resist.\"Oh, great. Just steal a horse and send it off to its death. Make your own headline so you can sell papers tomorrow. I can see it now: Corpse Found On Trolley Tracks Near Maniac's Love Nest.\"Genius could not take that lying down on the couch in only a pair of cargo shorts. \"Wait! If it was a dead horse, wouldn't it be a HORPSE? I'm a genius! That's my best line ever! A HORPSE! Get it? A horse corpse is a HORPSE!\"Yeah. Let's not start polishing your Grammy, Tony, Oscar, and Emmy just yet. Genius declared that this moved actually won an Oscar for something to do with the score or a song. Must have been slim pickin's in that category in 1992. I also informed the loyal fan that I could have easily shortened this movie by 30 minutes by simply omitting all the meaningful glances and pregnant pauses. And another thing. \"Why is it that people at the turn of the century were always storming out the window and scurrying down the fire escape?\"Genius had no answer to that. He lay all starry-eyed, anticipating the next song, so he could tip me off and tell me trivia. It did not help that he had been shown this movie by the school's music department, perhaps more than once. I was not about to let him off so easily. \"Oh, look! A flash mob just came around both corners, and joined in a choreographed parade down the street! And apparently, Newsies who can't afford to pay an extra ten cents on a hundred papes (that's what they called the newspapers in this movie) can eat amazingly well and have the energy to dance and sing all the livelong day while they're on strike! Whew! Can you imagine the smell of that movie set?\"Genius looked up from the couch pillow he was clutching to his concave bare chest. \"Oh, yeah!\" Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course.I really shouldn't torment him in his final days, over one of his favorite movies. He turned a deaf ear to my suggestion that Oliver! is a true musical with the same kind of choreography, and actually won the Best Picture Oscar in 1968. Even though Batman wasn't in it.Sadly, I don't know who will co-host my Critic's Corner once Genius makes his scheduled exit."}, {"title": "There Must Have Been a Rerun of Stand By Me", "date": "Monday, August 5, 2013", "text": "Alas! Poor MB, our embattled country mailbox, has taken another hit. This time, the attack was physical. No, not a mere groping by thieving paws, besmirching her dignity, while leaving her outer shell intact. This was a vicious, premeditated act of cowardice.Hick discovered MB in distress on Sunday morning. She and 15 of her closest friends, clinging precariously to their dignity, and their support system. Hick assumed it was an accident. A hit-and-run. Quarters are tight now with our county road being used as a major detour. The meeting of a large delivery truck and a dump truck pulling a backhoe, perhaps. A case of too much width and not enough road. A sideswiping that knocked MB and her cohorts off their pins.Yes, their roof and their flooring separated. Their individual partitions were ripped asunder. No longer do they enjoy their solitude, their privacy. Like insecure new inmates in a communal shower, they must avert their eyes, stare straight ahead. MB, gasping for fresh country air, is upset that her fine green coat was besmirched with wood rot and dust. Her neighbor, a fan of Home Alone, Scream, and Edvard Munch, emits a silent shriek.Hick, the caretaker to the old and decrepit, spent an hour shoring up their confidence. Set what bones he could. Braced their broken supports. All but one survived to carry out their daily activities at the start of the new work week.When The Pony and I went to town, we discovered that this was not the accident that Hick assumed. Evidence of additional carnage was clear to see. No, this was no accident.It will be remembered as the Night of the Federal Property Destroyers.***************************************************************The destruction of federal property in the form of rural mailboxes is not a new fad. It's been going on for years, and is most likely called \"boys being boys\" by those not personally affected. Still, it carries a fine of up to $250,000, and three years in prison for each act.Hick constructed MB of steel sewer pipe in an effort to make her indestructible. She holds her own. It's the framework in which she resides that takes a beating. Our fellow property owners came up with this long cubby box idea, to stop the more fragile mailboxes from being whomped on the top with metal bats and rebar and tire irons and crowbars and whatever federal property destructors are using these days. They cemented the metal supports, and have had few incidents of mass destruction over the past many years.Up the road, some mailboxes were completely gone, some were in ditches, some, in their wire cages, were just fine, and one batch was squeezed on top, as if a reverse Jaws of Life had pinched them like giant pliers. Homeowners out here take various routes to combat this willful destruction of federal property. One guy buys half a dozen cheap mailboxes, tightens one on his wooden post with two screws, and simply sets out a new one after destruction. Two people have built elaborate brick posts and semi-circular enclosures that surround their mailbox like a glove. A red, rectangular, brittle glove, but it has worked so far. Some buy the hard Little-Tikes-playground-type plastic enclosures. Another dude with a family compound row of six or eight mailboxes has his supports set up so that the framework will collapse upon contact, and all he has to do is set the whole thing up and put in a couple of screws. This is good business for screw manufacturers, it seems.So all of you who may brag of your youthful shenanigans playing inning after inning of mailbox baseball may want to ask yourselves, \"Is it worth $2.5 million, and 30 years in jail?\" This isn't the 1950s anymore. A good game camera that is motion-activated goes for less than $50 at Walmart. And some folks are armed and just plain crazy."}, {"title": "Then End of an Era", "date": "Sunday, August 4, 2013", "text": "The auction is a gift that keeps on giving.Hick loves shopping at the auction several times a week, and giving gifts that keep people working. And by \"people,\" I mean his own family members. Last night, he bought a new egg basket for The Pony. Now The Pony can put all his eggs in one basket. Heh, heh! See what I did there? Put all his eggs in one basket! I crack myself up sometimes. Actually, The Pony can't put all his eggs in one basket, because the tiny eggs that I think are reptile eggs but Hick says are just itty bitty chicken eggs in spite of their leathery shell would simply fall out of this new basket. And so would the banty eggs. You know. The ones my mom really likes, according to Hick.The Pony has been collecting eggs in an old Easter basket since we first got chickens. Guess where the chickens came from. You got it! The auction! Those first feathered friends were leghorns, and they sure were layers. Then Hick bought a crate with a Typhoid Clucker. He said he heard one cough, but he didn't think anything of it, and turned the new chickens in with the old chickens, and decimated the flock. Poor Pony was on deathwatch that summer. Every day, he found a fowl corpse. Those leghorns were not hardy enough, I suppose. Now we have pretty, pretty Ameraucaunas who lay colored eggs, and ugly, ugly turkens who are butt-ugly but quite prolific. They are both a sturdy lot who only succumb to being eaten by predators.Don't tell The Pony, but his new egg basket is really made for golf balls. But it's good enough to carry eggs. The Easter basket was on its last legs. The bottom was held in by several bread twist ties. And for a dollar, you can't go wrong buying a golf ball pail to carry eggs.Though I would draw the line at trying to fill it with Diet Coke."}, {"title": "You Say Tomato, I Say AUCTION TOMATOES!", "date": "Saturday, August 3, 2013", "text": "From the man who almost bought me Auction Meat...I proudly announce: Auction Tomatoes!They appeared on my kitchen counter overnight. This was one of Hick's bargains. He got 11 tomatoes for $3.00, which is better than the $3.65 I paid for THREE tomatoes from Walmart last week. I swear, I don't know how people eat without auctions!We don't have a garden. We tried, way back when the boys were little. Borrowed a tiller from my grandma, dug up the earth behind the garage, and planted carrots, corn, tomatoes, onions, watermelon, and cantaloupe. Funny how the animals that lived here before us thought it was a salad bar. We claimed a few carrots, maybe a tiny onion or two, and a couple of tomatoes.The cats thought they were big game hunters, laying around the garden and nabbing rabbits galore. Dragging those hulking rabbits across the front yard, practically chest-thumping over their victory, only to have their prizes wrenched from their jaws by the dogs. Oh, and the cats also thought the garden doubled as a feline latrine.The most depressing days were when we could spy the baby melons in the evening, marveling at their expansion, only to observe a deer standing over them the next morning as we backed out of the garage. Then there was the herd of neighbor horses that got loose and tore up the garden like hyperactive Lipizzaner Stallions in a rectangular show ring. Birds perched on the plants throughout the day, pecking through the tender blushing skin of the tomatoes.The darkest hour was when, at sunset, I went to pick a ripe tomato for supper, and my hand went through the back of it, just as a GIANT GREEN TOMATO HORNWORM peeped over the top. I sent Genius to find Hick. My screams must have given him a sense of urgency, unlike my cries heralding the two-minute-contraction phase of Genius's labor, which prompted Hick to take a shower and pack himself a bag of comfortable shoes and Milky Ways before driving me to the hospital...because he came running to the garden carnage.Mighty Hick, my hero, grabbed that hornworm between his thumb and index finger, and exclaimed, \"He tried to bit me!\" Next thing I knew, Hick's hand was awash with tomato seeds. Tomato hornworms apparently poop themselves when their heads are crushed by a heroic husband. Since it was not feasible for Hick to stand in the garden all day and pick hornworms off the tomatoes, we tried a powder insecticide. By then we had only a few tomatoes left.Our gardening days are over.

I dropped him off at Little Caesar's. Mom was getting him a pizza for lunch. After all, it was nearly 11:00 a.m. I pulled out of the parking lot onto the city street. It was a right turn. The only oncoming traffic was a football field away, having just gained a green light. Yet within seconds that speed demon was upon me. On me like Val on a 44 oz. Diet Coke.I was going the speed limit, of course. Val is no scofflaw. Rolling along at 35 mph without a care in the world, visions of 44 oz. Diet Coke dancing, with thumbs and little kicks, in my head. And then that sight in the rearview mirror, scarier than the Animal House \"Eat Me\" cake car. It was an itsy bitsy teeny weeny metallic baby-poop-green miniature SUV. So close that I could not even see its rubber baby SUV bumper. That's too close! If I had suddenly slammed T-Hoe's transmission into PARK, and then REVERSE, his beeper would have warned me that an object was in imminent danger of strikage.It was only about a half mile to my turn. A right, just past my mom's bank. You know, the one that shorted her ten dollars on her check deposit with not-enough-cash back. I signaled with plenty of time before the turn, yet not too soon so as to make my automotive dingleberry think I was turning into the bank to be shorted ten dollars. I applied the brakes, and slowed gradually for my turn. A sharp turn, I might add. More than a 90-degree turn. Kind of like a switch-back on Pike's Peak. Oh, dear sweet mother of all that is phobic, DO NOT EVER drive up or down Pike's Peak. They have a train to get you there. No need to go all Overlook Hotel creepy-music crazy getting there by pavement.As I pulled T-Hoe's steering wheel to the right to commence my turn, Speed Demon HONKED at me! Can you believe it? Someone as safe and careful and law-abiding as myself, getting the HORN?I don't know why Speed Demon didn't just whip into the center turn lane to go around me.

This might not be the best thing to read if you're weak of stomach. Thank goodness I am my own quality control inspector.When The Pony and I take off for town, I grab a 44 oz. styrofoam cup suitable for refilling with Diet Coke. Yes, I have three spares in T-Hoe, but I always bring one from the house. That's because you never know when you might run into somebody who wants a giant beverage. Cheap. And I learned my lesson that day I only had one car cup with me, and I tottered like a Whoville Who on a homemade Whocycle as I walked around the back-end of T-Hoe, and crunched my cup with a not-so-svelte hip against his rear bumper.I wash out my refill cup every night, or morning. As we leave, I run a little bit of water into it, and add five or six ice cubes from Frig's freezer door. Two birds, one stone. I can quench my thirst if needed, and then toss it out to refill with Diet Coke. No need for a separate water cup.It might have been the day I was readying Hick's passport renewal materials, or gathering bills. I asked The Pony to get my cup and put a little water and ice in it. He knows the drill. He's usually standing there while I do this last-minute task myself. Let the record show that there's always a 44 oz. cup drying in the sink drainer, and one or two outer cups on the kitchen counter. Those are cups that have outlived their usefulness, and act as insulators to hold the precious full cup of Diet Coke as it sits on my desk all afternoon.I rushed into the kitchen, grabbed my cell phone from the charger, and took the water cup The Pony handed me. I looked inside to make sure there was not too much or too little water. THERE WAS BROWN DIET COKE WATER IN THE ICE! And brown stains on the side. And The Pony thought I was going to sip on that while driving. The horror! Seems The Pony had grabbed an outer cup, not washed every day, and added water and ice.I had not felt that queasy since Genius was a toddler asking for sips of my Bubba Cup of ice water. Since that day I popped the lid off that night, and saw that the inch of fluid in the bottom resembled the waters of the Missouri River. The Big Muddy. Like frothy hot chocolate. With the froth being toddler saliva.Kids and drinking just don't mix."}, {"title": "Has Hick, Perhaps, Been Moonlighting?", "date": "Wednesday, July 31, 2013", "text": "I am concerned that Hick might secretly be a member of those Sisters in Crime, the women's mystery-writing group my mom warned me about.Last evening, he had some scathingly brilliant idea that involved a surveillance sting at a local lake development where we own property. I did not inquire about the details. Sometimes, it's better not to know. However, he let it slip that he wanted to use Genius and his electronic know-how. Genius was not home at the time, and upon my telephone inquiry, emphatically stated, \"No way!\" Which left Hick to his own devices. I cautioned him that he was not a private investigator, and that slipshod snooping could get him chopped up and dumped into a septic tank. Still, he set out on his own.We used to go to this lake quite a bit, since our property ownage and the accompanying annual fees allowed us access to the main lake, several ponds, a pool, and various other attractive nuisances. Our attendance has fallen off in recent years. Hick's older boys were just the right age when we had a little pontoon boat, and got our fishing licenses every year. Then we had our young 'uns, who were not pontoon friendly. Nor fishing-pond friendly. Some years, Hick even forgot until the last minute to go pick up our card to hang from the rearview mirror to gain entrance at the guard shack.I was in my basement lair when Hick returned. He went about his business, and I mine. The fact that I had not been summoned to bail him out of the county jail was a good sign. I watched some late-night TV. Fell asleep in the recliner. And ascended the stairs in the wee hours. As I went to the kitchen to plug in my cell phone, I spied a paper plate message. That's how Hick communicates.\"Did you pay Lost Lake dues they took my card and said my access was denied he took my card he checked the computer & it just said access denied\"See? The first thing this do-it-yourself-detective does is blame the bill-payer. I swear. I am the bad-news Chuck Norris. Everything is my fault. I went to elaborate lengths to not pay our association dues, just so Hick could not solve his mystery. Guess that draft will go into his bottom drawer.The thing is, had he only asked when he got home, I could have told him in less than five minutes. The records were within arm's reach of my perch at my basement control center. But since he chose the paper plate route, I had to respond in kind. I left a reply on the bottom half of the plate.\"Too bad you didn't mention this last night so I could look it up. I'll have to find the old check register that goes back to November, which is downstairs in last year's taxes, which is right beside where I was sitting for several hours after you got home. Maybe \"Access Denied\" referred to the computer access to those files.\"Smartly, Hick did not add any further message to the paper plate. I just have a hunch that guard shack lever-lifters don't have access to the financial records of the lake association. And that when Hick insisted that the guy look him up and see that the fees were paid, the guy said, \"It tells me 'access denied.'\" Meaning the files.Anyhoo...I looked it up this morning, and sent Hick an email with the check numbers, date paid, plat and lot number, owner ID number, and street address of the lot. Of course he did not respond. Are you kidding? It wasn't in his paper plate medium. So I called at noon to see what was going on. Well. Hick is not in the same building all day every day. So his email was unchecked. Is that any way to run a business? I think not. And no way to gather material for a Sister in Crime, either!Hick had work business towards home this afternoon, and he went back to check on his denied access. Oh. They saw that all fees had been paid. Had no explanation for why the guard shack dude took Hick's card. Nor why the mass emailing or snail-mailing of something-or-other in the records did not include Hick. Unless, perhaps, it was because he had not come into the office to pick up his entrance card for the year.I think that Sister is gonna need some help in tying up the loose ends of his mystery."}, {"title": "It Wasn't Exactly a Crime", "date": "Tuesday, July 30, 2013", "text": "Just another day in paradise here in beautiful Backroads. I was assaulted by a maximum security correctional center inmate on the way to my mom's house yesterday. Oh, don't worry about ol' Val. She's just fine. Here's how the incident went down.I was piloting T-Hoe along city streets when I spied a \"Men Working\" sign. No big deal. It was the third one I had seen on this particular trip. Cresting a little hill by the long-abandoned, razed-building, Coca Cola bottling plant site, I saw a work crew from one of the local maximum security prisons. I'm not sure which one. There are three within 25 miles. Yes, Val lives in the Maximum Security Triangle.These work crews are all over the place, trimming grass and weeds along the roads. They don't get mowers. Only those on the prison grounds can ride those spiffy, circle-spinning, hand-controlled mowers in jet pilot formation. The ones along the road are only supplied with weedeaters. They are all in the standard uniform white T-shirt with gray slacks. Usually a white prison van is parked nearby, and a brown-uniformed guard with a shotgun stands at the ready. There's never been any trouble that I know of, save for years ago, when we only had one prison, when a work-detail dude ran off and was found hiding under a boat. It's a pretty good gig to get out into the community, I suppose, if you're confined all the livelong day for nearly the rest of your natural born days. So they don't want to do anything to mess up their several-cents-an-hour job.As I drove past the weed-consuming crew, a gigantic boulder thudded against T-Hoe's left flank. He shuddered. I shook. In the door mirror, I saw all of the incarcerated employees staring open-mouthed after our rapidly receding haunches. That's how hard it hit. I still have not dared inspect the real or imagined damage. I don't want to know. That's because you can't sue the state of Missouri. And I mailed the last payment on T-Hoe last month. We got the title lien release thingy last week. Ain't that always how it goes?In other news, my day went downhill from there. About a half mile up the road, we noticed that the center stripes and sidelines had been painted. Badly. The center was fine, but one side was larger than the other. In fact, a good three feet of pavement extended past the side line in some places. \"It's called The Shoulder,\" said The Pony. Even though this road had no shoulder before, and no more pavement had been added. Oh, well. He'll learn soon enough when he really starts driving his little truck. Oh, and that line changed intermittently, narrow, then wide, like driving along the falling sands in an hourglass.I picked up Mom, dropped off The Pony for high-speed internet use, and headed off to redistribute some of Genius's college funds. We encountered another work crew, these in a lift truck with a flagman waving me into incoming traffic. An inmate would have known better. Further up the road, at a speed of 10 mph, we spied the problem many cars ahead. It was a pair of orange highway department road-striping trucks. They were not putting down paint. And they could barely fit between the yellow center stripes and the white sideline. I believe that qualifies as irony.To add a final insult to my non-injury for the day, a most disturbing incident occurred as The Pony and I wended our way home. I pulled into the gas station chicken store for my 44 oz. Diet Coke. My favorite parking space welcomed me. I unhooked my seatbelt. I picked up my coinage and refill cup. And a scofflaw pulled her car right up beside me in the no-parking zone where it impeded my progress into the store, and blocked the truck pumping gas under the roof. I had no patience left for such nonsense. I flung my seatbelt back on, and told The Pony. \"I'm not even dealing with this today.\" It's hard to keep my uncivil tongue in my mouth when I encounter these parking lot ruffians.Off under the overpass we went, to The Voice of the Village. Some ne'er-do-well had discarded a 44 oz. styrofoam cup on their parking lot. Oh, the inhumanity! Somebody could have saved forty cents with that cup! I pulled into a regular parking space with the law-abiding parkers of the Village. A man came walking across the lot as I gathered my beverage-harvesting accoutrements. \"Oh, no! Just my luck! He's going to get to the soda fountain before me! And with my luck today, he'll get the last of the ice, or the last of the Diet Coke. Wait! Maybe he just picked up some cups off the lot to put in the trash can.\" Nope. He went in the store with two cups.I headed in anyway. To be first in line after him. A lady was walking my way with a cup, but she wasn't even close enough for me to hold the door open for her behind me. I waited a respectful distance from the fountain. Dude was on his second soda. Almost my turn. Just as he popped the lid on his last cup, that woman stepped up and started a cascade of ice into her cup. IT WAS MY TURN!But wait. That was not the worst part. SHE WAS THE CASHIER FROM THE GAS STATION CHICKEN STORE! Getting a fountain soda at her competitor. She looked at me and chuckled. I was polite. You never know when you're going to need a favor when Diet Coke is concerned. \"I just came from your store! I was getting out of the car when somebody pulled in there where you have the curb stopper so people won't drive into the building. I hate it when people park there. So I left and came over here.\"\"Oh, I do, too! They do it ALL the time! I'm working in the kitchen now. Did you know that?\"Well, no. Because she just took my money at the register the day before. Anyway, I asked if she was happy, and she said she guessed so, that she had worked in the kitchen years ago. But she was glad her hours didn't start until 9:00 now, even if it meant cleaning the chicken kitchen at night before closing.Dang. Busted. I felt like Jerry Seinfeld when he went to a new barber, and Enzo walked in as he was getting his hair cut.At least I know that NOTHING can make my hair look any worse than it does now."}, {"title": "Help Wanted.

It's not like some odorous rural garbage dump, back when \"landfill\" was just a gleam in the eye of political correctness. It's not like an establishment named Ye Olde Pigge Entrails Shoppe, run by an Original 13 Colonies ex-pat in the teeming equatorial rainforest.

It's on the table by my plier-lamp (read about that plier-lamp in the upcoming Not Your Mother's Book...on Home Improvement, due out September 10), right next to my red wooden backscratcher that I got for Christmas one year.

Because he needs to practice practice practice, even though he has not asked how to get to Carnegie Hall, he needs a vehicle. One that he can learn to drive now, and feel comfortable taking his driver's test in. Hick found a bargain on Friday.Is that little Ford Ranger not as cute as a bug's ear? It's even cuter without the camper shell. That camper was not on it last night when Hick drove it home. Yeah. That's how the salesmen get their hooks in you. They keep your high-mile Chrysler Pacifica on the lot, and let you smell the new-car spray in the vehicle you show an interest in. I'm surprised the wiper fluid didn't shoot out a rainbow, and dancing unicorns did not lead a processional out of town. I had no idea that Hick would score a FREE camper shell in the deal, especially after the paperwork was already completed. This is a 2002, same year as Genius's Ford Ranger, which is red, instead of maroon. Best of all, it has 4WD, which is a necessity out here in Outer Backroadsia.You might notice that a certain sweet, sweet doggie had to insert herself in the foreground. The background is filled with the $1000 Caravan, the Hick-rigged roof of his Gator, the faded-out cedar-sided garage, and Genius's old basketball goal cranked down to might-as-well-NOT-catch the wind.Many thanks go out to The Pony's grandma, my very own slaw-lovin' mom, who donated a healthy sum towards the purchase of first vehicles for each of her four grandchildren. The Pony is the fourth. She rocks, that selfless septuagenarian! The Pony called her this evening, to tell her all about it. He's not much of a talker. After pawning the call off on me, he high-tailed it back to his computer games. Mom was ecstatic that he sounded so excited. This might just be the prod he needs to log some drive time.Hick and The Pony are taking his Ranger to Mom's house tomorrow to show it off.

I promise. This is the end of the Junk Store Chronicles.None of the big muckety-mucks wanted to work weekends. Even if you've made your career as a junk store supervisor, you desire Monday-Friday, 9:00-5:00 hours. Still, such a booming business could not be entrusted to mere minimum-wage workers. Emmett was our designated guy in charge. Only 17, he WAS the son of Joy, the floor supervisor. We had an uneasy truce. We wouldn't divulge his shenanigans, and he was lax on break times.We cashier girls soon learned Emmett's idiosyncrasies. He liked working the cash register, to a point. After a while he grew bored, and preferred to ride a stick-horse around the store waving a cowboy hat, or talk to the boot girls. During the slow morning hours, Emmett assigned us to straighten various departments. As customers grew more numerous, he would use one of us to open the second register. But beware the call, \"Val to the front, Val to the front.\" That meant Emmett was going to ask for a break, never to return, and you were stuck at the register until closing. Once elderly Harriet and I caught on, he had to get trickier. \"Val to the front for returns. Val to the front!\" Harriet had more backbone than I. \"Screw him. I'm going to sit back here in the rubber boots. He can't come find me.\"Emmett loved cutting up credit cards. We used a VeriCheck box to slide cards through. When it was declined, we had to call an 800 number. Often, we were told to destroy the card. Emmett did this with a flourish. He held it shoulder high, grabbed a heavy pair of black-handled scissors from the shelf below the register, and snipped. \"Sorry! Your credit card company says it's no good.\" Usually folks pulled out another card to try.He also loved to play Big Man in Store. For instance, a woman wearing a fur stole might wheel up a cart with two lamps. \"I want THIS lamp, marked $10, but I want it for the $5 marked on this identical lamp. See?\" During the week, Charlene would handle the situation like this: \"Oh, honey. That lamp is marked $5 because it doesn't work. If you want the working lamp, sweetie, you'll have to pay $10.\" Emmett used this tactic: \"Those pricers! They can't do anything right! Both of those lamps should be marked $10. I'll have a talk with those pricers.\" Then he would put the $5 lamp in the return basket. And put it back on the shelf as soon as the customer left.This job gave me my first and only opportunity to take a polygraph test. And by opportunity, I mean I had no choice. The polygraph dude came in and set up in the Old Man's office in the basement. I don't think he took a crap while he was down there. By the time I got to work, polygraph talk was rampant. Every employee had to take it. Even those who were off were called in. Charlene and Joy and Flora and Boot Boss and all the upstairs and downstairs workers were polygraphed, whether they had access to the cash register or not. Seems that money had come up missing more than once. A hundred or so per week.Have you ever had a polygraph? It's quite interesting. Maybe you saw Jerry Seinfeld hooked up to determine if he watched Melrose Place. The process might have changed by now, but I was asked to sit in a chair with a stretchy rubber tubing kind of band around my chest and stomach area, a blood pressure cuff on my arm, and a thingy on my fingertip kind of like a pulse-ox machine, then asked a series of baseline questions. I could watch the needle on the graph recorder thingy the whole time. The dude started with questions about my name and age, easily verifiable stuff. I was told to tell a lie on ONE answer. Then he proceeded with the actual questioning. Most of it was basic info about store operations. The kicker was the question: \"Do you think you know who took the money?\" I answered \"yes.\" At no point was I asked if I took the money. Or who the person was. Maybe they got all of that from somebody else, or maybe somebody confessed later, because I was never questioned further.I really enjoyed this job. All the employees got along. We went to Silver Dollar City, we had a barbecue, we went out dancing. Good times. They welcomed me with open arms, because I did my job. I don't mean to brag, but after only two months, I GOT A TEN-CENT RAISE! Flora was wriggling like a tickled pup when she told me. \"I talked to Mr. Old Man about how well you're doing, and I'm giving you a TEN-CENT RAISE! Uh huh.\" I later learned that raises were quite unusual for my kind of job. Flora went on to tell me that she was so happy she hired me. \"That first day, I told Mr. Old Man, 'She looks clean. I'm going to hire her.' Uh huh. I hope you stay with us as long as you can. Uh huh.\"Yep. I stayed a whole year, until my Master's was complete, and I landed another teaching job.

That's the Psycho stabby sound. Just when you thought it was safe to return to read a \"normal\" post from Val, you discover that she is still beating the old junk store into submission.Security guard Ronnie was surprisingly effective at stopping boot theft. First of all, he dressed like a rent-a-cop. And he had shifty eyes. I'm sure many a scurvy thief re-evaluated his sticky-footed plan to abscond with a fine pair of ostrich or crocodile or python boots. One particular evening, Ronnie watched as a dude nodded to him and walked out the entrance. \"Hey, buddy. Come back here.\" Thief took off down the parking lot. Ronnie followed. Rush hour traffic on Glenstone, the main drag, slowed Thief enough for Ronnie to close the gap. They both found breaks in traffic as the light changed. Thief made it across first, and climbed up on the railroad overpass that ran beside the store. He headed back the way he had come. Ronnie yelled at him to stop again. They continued to run down the tracks, an every-slowing smoker's pace, sucking the humid sunset air. \"Stop!\"...wheeze...wheeze...\"Stop...\"\"All right, dude\"...wheeze...wheeze...\"I give up...\"wheeze...\"It's not worth it\"...wheeze...wheeze...Thief laid down on the tracks. Ronnie grabbed the boots off his feet and yanked him up to march him back to the store.\"Jesus, buddy! All this for a pair of two-for-$19.99? What's wrong with you?\"Ronnie had a habit of sneaking up behind people and breaking their necks. At least that's what it looked and sounded like. He said he was an amateur chiropractor. He grabbed his victims by the chin with one hand, and the top back of the had with the other, and yanked until a giant CRACK was heard. After the initial shock, the victim walked away declaring how much better he felt. Most likely it was joy to still be alive and able to move all four limbs.Undoubtedly the best day of Ronnie's work life that I observed was when the foreign girls came to town. I don't know where they came from. I don't know their exact ages. All I know is that they were pale, talkative, excited by our long racks of prom dresses, and spoke in a language I did not recognize. Not English, not Spanish, not French, not Italian, not Russian. Perhaps some kind of Eastern Bloc dialect. Apparently, it was customary in their country to try on clothing before buying it, without the benefit of a dressing room. They were stripping right and left, hiking formals over their heads with abandon. I went up front to report the activity and see what we should do. Ronnie had just spied it on the four-sectioned security camera display. Flora called Charlene to the front, and together they went to diplomatically explain that trying on must be done in the store bathroom, or over their clothes. A lot of pantomiming and pointing got the message across.Ronnie also had to watch out for big sales rip-offs. The middle of the store sported a gaping hole with wide stairs that led to the basement. It housed paint, tile, and wallpaper. We did a tremendous business in hardware. The parking lot was half full of lumber and bathtubs and shower enclosures and toilets. Any hardware had to be rung up with a ticket written by a salesman, and no materials could be loaded without a salesman assisting the customer. Salesmen worked on commission. It was a cutthroat operation. They were assigned rotating duties such as parking lot, wallpaper, paint, and hardware. Parking lot was prime, because that was the big lumber sales. Two had that duty each day. They stood near the doors, ready to pounce on customers eyeing the outside goods. If both were busy, and a customer asked who to see about lumber, the cashier called a salesman of her choosing. That's why it paid to be nice to the cashiers, and not act like a jackass.The problem with the hardware department was that customers like to take a dump in the wallpaper bin aisles. Seriously. A sure sign was when Charlene was called over the intercom to assist in the basement. That meant she was picking up turds in a wastebasket to bring up to the bathroom for flushing. Charlene was our go-to gal when the toilet overflowed, too.On weekends, Charlene and Joy were off. Flora only worked half a day. That meant I had to be a cashier. Chaos and anarchy skipped hand in hand down the flower-petaled path to not-heaven on weekends.To be continued..."}, {"title": "One Man's Junk is Another Woman's Job, Part 2", "date": "Thursday, July 25, 2013", "text": "...continued from yesterday, wherein I had just been hired by Flora, bookkeeper at the insurance salvage store. I reported to Flora for my first day of work. She introduced me to Charlene, a six-foot-tall Dolly Parton lookalike. \"You'll be working with Charlene in the pricing department. But we always start new people out in Rubber Boots. Charlene will show you what to do.\"Charlene took me to the opposite corner of the store from Flora's ivory aerie. The place was as big as a Walmart Supercenter, but not as well-lit. Charlene picked a couple of boots off the floor. They were an assortment of black and green rubber boots. The kind dairy farmers wear. Some were hip boots for fishermen. And some had liners, like kids wear in the snow. \"People are always digging through these. Find the mates, and line them up according to size. Go to Flora when you're done, and I'll come get you.\"Talk about a Herculean task. Which became a Sisyphean task every night. It was hotter than forty hecks in that place. No air circulated back in the corner. No windows in the whole place. Only the IN double glass doors, and the OUT double glass doors up by Flora's perch. I was sweating like a member of the world's oldest profession in a house of worship by the time I set the boots straight. I went to Flora. \"Oh, you're done already?\" She called Charlene, who took told me to clock out so we could go to lunch. That was to become our practice a couple times a week. I could take an hour lunch, or a half-hour lunch, so long as I clocked in and out, and worked my allotted hours. Lunch with Charlene meant walking across the blacktop parking lot to the Chinese takeout restaurant next door, where we feasted on sweet & sour chicken, or cashew chicken. It was delicious. The rest of the state does not do cashew chicken like Springfield does cashew chicken.My days were spent writing prices on items with a black magic marker. No price tags for people to rip off and lie about. Some crafty customers actually brought in their own magic markers and tried to change prices, but our staff knew our writing, and price placement. All the merchandise came from insurance buyouts. The Old Man might buy three boxcars full of merchandise from a store damaged by fire or flooding or some other calamity. He got stuff for pennies on the dollar. Not everything was damaged. A lot of our best stuff was returns from J. C. Penney. Nothing wrong with it. I still have a wonderfully warm comforter that I bought there. We got an employee discount, too. The way pricing worked was that Charlene would give me a box of stuff and a J. C. Penney catalog. Then I looked up the items and wrote a figure that was half the catalog price on the merchandise. On the bedding and clothes, we wrote it on the tag. Stuff that couldn't be found in the catalog went to Charlene. She had a calculating mind, and was pretty spot-on with her assessments. She would have been a champion on The Price is Right.When there was no pricing to be done, I was farmed out to Joy, the floor manager. The first day of work with Joy was always Toys and Pet Supplies. That involved picking up items off the floor and rehanging them on the pegboard. It was Joy's version of Rubber Boots. After proving myself to the cynical, Chuck-Berris-looking Joy, I graduated to moving racks, re-arraning displays, and folding Levi jeans. That was actually one of my favorite duties. We had tables and tables of Levi jeans. If you looked close enough, you could find red tabs. I don't know where the jeans came from, but they were worn just enough to be broken in. We did quite a lot of business in them, and they were forever getting toppled and unsized. The tables were near the cash registers and front door, and I could chat with Ronnie the security guard and one of the cashiers when business was slow.One day a weird dude in a Member's Only jacket was weirding his way around my area. I kind of watched him, but I didn't know what he was up to. I found out soon enough. He went to pay for some single item off a pegboard near the register, and I heard Emmett, Joy's high-school-age son who was cashier that day, tell him he couldn't leave. The guy became indignant, demanding to know why. Ronnie stepped over to the register. Emmett said, \"Because of what you have stuffed in your jacket.\" After much hemming and hawing, Weird Dude unzipped his Member's Only and out fell about ten packs of men's underwear. That's the thing. I should have noticed that normal people don't wear a jacket in late-summer heat. Weird Dude declared that he would never buy our cheap crap, and stomped out. Good enough to steal, but not good enough to buy, I guess.Ronnie stood at the IN door and looked at every customer's feet as they entered. That's because the boots were the most valuable item in the store, and nobody was gonna walk out in a pair on Ronnie's watch.To be continued..."}, {"title": "One Man's Junk is Another Woman's Job", "date": "Wednesday, July 24, 2013", "text": "Like many people of her era, Val has a checkered employment past.

Just a variety of teaching assignments, convenience-store cashier, five years with the state unemployment service, softball umpire in a teenage fast-pitch league, and the piece de resistance...pricer/clerk/cashier in a junk store!Technically, the establishment was an insurance salvage store. It had name recognition in the minor metropolis of Springfield, Missouri. I had returned to my college town after several years of teaching, in order to finish my Master's degree. I was looking for a part-time job to defray the drain on my recently-amassed savings. I fondly remembered shopping for various oddities at this store. I saw an ad in the paper, and headed out to put in an application.The lady in charge was perched above the sales floor, in a fake-wood-paneled, waist-high aerie of sorts. I was later to realize this was so she could keep an eagle eye on the workers. She even had a pair of binoculars. Nobody messed with...um...let's call her Flora. Flora dressed like a country-singing opening act at a county fair. She favored blue jeans, women's cowboy boots, patterned shirts, and a red bandana neckerchief. Which is not to say that she slacked in the make-up or bouffant department. It was a look that worked for her. She had a what I thought might be a slight speech impediment, but turned out to be simply an affectation. At the end of each verbal paragraph, she would say, \"Uh huh.\" But not in a creepy way like Billy Bob Thornton in Sling Blade saying, \"Mm hmm.\"Flora climbed down from her perch to show me into the break room next door, where she let me have a clipboard to fill out my application. The break room was a long shelved room, unfinished, with a myriad of shoeboxes lining the walls. It was, after all, located in the boot department. The store did a large amount of business in boots. Exotic skins that were supposedly regulated. Several-hundred-dollar pairs of boots. The guy who ran that department was The Old Man's right-hand man. It was good to watch your Ps and Qs around him. His workers had the highest status of all the employees.I shook hands with Flora and left. I didn't really think I would get the job, because at the time, I had no retail experience. Flora called me the next day. \"We'd like to hire you. When can you come in? We'll start you at 20-30 hours a week. We can work around your schedule.\"To be continued..."}, {"title": "There Are 8 Million Stories in the Waiting Rooms of Backroads", "date": "Tuesday, July 23, 2013", "text": "I took The Pony to the dentist today for his six-month cleaning.

Of course I had taken the seat nearest the door, as I am wont to do. Which so happened to be the one nearest the class-enclosed receptionist area. Typhoid Mary wheezed in and pecked on the glass. I am not sure that the receptionist slid her shoebox-sized door open.Typhoid Mary inquired about the receptionist's son. Because the normal thing for a layman to do in a medical establishment is flaunt her immunity to violations of HIPAA by outing medical info on relatives of the workers.

I suppose her goal was to drop in and explain why she wasn't keeping her appointment. Which apparently she had already telegraphed through other means. The fact that she whined about not wanting to do anything but go home and crawl into bed made me want to shout, \"DON'T LET THE DOOR HIT YOU ON THE RUMPUS ON YOUR WAY OUT!\" Because there she was, hacking and bronchially-challengedly breathing her germs in my general vicinity.

The fact that he once replaced a silver stopper in her white downstairs bathroom sink with a blue one did not deter her from seeking his services again. This time, he brought his son. His fifty-year-old son, if that tells you anything about the speed at which this job was being completed. Mom is like my sister the former-mayor's wife when it comes to people being in her house. Sis always went to visit Mom on the day her cleaning woman was scheduled. Now she has a cleaning man, and she still makes herself scarce. Mom moved to various rooms as her work crew hobbled through the house.\"I'm in the living room right now, on the kitchen phone, because they're eating lunch down in the family room. No. I didn't make it. They brought their own. They took all those boards that were up in the ceiling and laid them out behind the house. If Hick wants them, he can have them. There's some metal pipes, too. And a heavy box that I can't lift full of metal things. And some old bottles. It looks like rain, so I might go out and cover the boards with an old tablecloth. That won't hurt it. I got it at Dollar Tree.\"I told Mom I would run by with The Pony to help her cover the boards. She had thought of cutting off some plastic from a big roll in the basement, but since the workers were wearing masks, and she didn't have one, she was afraid. I called Hick on his lunch break. He was practically doing cartwheels, the best I could tell over the phone. \"Tell her I'll come out after work. It won't hurt those boards to get a little bit wet.\" Of course enough is never as good as a feast for Hick. \"What about the old insulation? What's she going to do with that?\"\"As far as I know, her workers are taking it to the landfill.\"\"Tell her to keep it. I can put it in the BARn.\"\"Are you sure about that? It might be asbestos.\"\"Naw. It would be fiberglass. Never mind. They can haul it off.\"The Pony and I arrived to see the workers' truck parked in the driveway, with three pieces of metal about twelve feet long leaning up against the side away from the porch. Mom came out to greet The Pony. \"Do you know these guys have some metal leaned up on the truck?\"\"No...I don't see any. But I told them they could have a couple of pieces.\"\"That's three. Not a couple. You might want to watch what they carry out. I don't want them to take advantage of you.\"\"Oh, it's just old metal.\"The Pony did his covering job. Mom lurked around out of sight until her crew left. Hick went to grab his treasures in his truck with no brakes before Genius drove it and found out it had no brakes. He got some 12-foot 2 x 4s, some conduit, and some copper rods. Everybody's happy except me (shocker!) because I think those guys are going to help themselves to what Mom thinks is junk.Hick went by today and picked up a box of old bottles. Mom has more for him after she looks through some milk bottles that she is sure she has cardboard caps for. Hick has his eyes on the heavy box with an old light guard and some ancient extension cords visible near the top. He figures it is scrap metal that he can send with Genius to the junk dealer.Hick is a master recycler."}, {"title": "Don't Even Get Me Started on the Newly-Shortened Strings of a Certain Feminine Hygiene Product", "date": "Thursday, July 18, 2013", "text": "The latest product receiving an unfavorable review here at Val's Gripatorium is Great Value Heavy-Duty Paper Plates. Not those Chinet cardboard-type platters that can hold an entire Thanksgiving dinner. The regular, everyday, crimped-edge paper plates with a greaseproof coating. They come in a flimsy newsprint-thickness version, but that one's not on my radar today.The plates work just fine. They are sturdy enough, yet not too thick. They're good for slicing onions, pickles, and tomatoes without juice soaking through while the fixin's sit on the counter to be added to hamburgers hot off Gassy G. And they can be used as our everyday china without dripping slaw or quesadilla runoff or french onion dip.The problem is the latest package of Great Value heavy-duty paper plates. They are stuck together so tightly that it would be an upper-body workout for The Rock himself to pry them apart. I know that paper plates stick together. This brand has always needed some separation. But this recent batch is off the hook in togetherness. Every two plates are cemented together. Every two. No random stickage. Every two. It's not just one little corner of those round plates. A couple of crimps along the edge. Nope. These plates are like giant paper pita pockets, with an opening only large enough for a medium pickle slice to slip through.I have to spin those plates round and round until I find the crack in their armor. Pry one finger inside and start working my way around the edge. The plates used to be attached by a mere two or three crimps, only along the edge. Like a clam shell. And it was a random placement every five, six, or seven plates through the stack. Now it takes considerable time and effort to rip them asunder. I think it's a scam. What are the odds that EVERY TWO PLATES are stuck together that tightly? Yes, I think it's a scam to make me buy twice as many plates. Some people might not even know that two plates are there. \"Wow! These are really heavy-duty plates!\" Not noticing that they are only getting half the amount listed on the package.I haven't been this incensed since my Puffs With Aloe started having irregular or non-existent folds along the sides.The paper products conspire against me."}, {"title": "Stop Him, He's Out of Control!", "date": "Wednesday, July 17, 2013", "text": "Every summer Hick resents our vacation from school. He leaves chores for all of us, like he's in charge around here. We go through the motions.The Pony, on goat-herding duty every morning, finds ways to shave an hour into 15 minutes if he's feeling cantankerous. Or he waits until afternoon when the skies cloud up, and says, \"We can tell Dad it rained, so I didn't let them out today.\" The goats are not being harmed. They have acres of fenced pen, and receive hay and goat chow every evening.My chore for today was to send in Hick's passport for renewal. Because he has been forgetting since April, when he got a new photo. I was reading through the five pages of printout he left me with instructions when the phone rang. It was Genius.\"Can you come pick me up at the bowling alley?\"Believe me, he was not bowling. Saturday afternoon leagues are over. The bowling alley is not even open on Wednesday mornings. And Genius had been fulfilling his duty of hauling a load of gravel for Hick. So now he was at the bowling alley with Hick's truck, and a long-bed full of 2-inch clean.''Are you all right? Why are you at the bowling alley?\"\"I HAVE NO BRAKES!\"\"I'll be right there.\"Yes, only Hick would send his 18-year-old son with $20 to buy a truckload of gravel in a 4WD Ford 250 Extended Cab with bad brakes. I have not liked that truck since he bought it. Not like I drive it regularly. It's been years. But when we had vehicle problems, or when the power was out and I couldn't get my car out of the garage, I drove it. It always felt like it was running away with me. I used to have dreams about driving it with no brakes.According to Genius, even the emergency brake lost function. From the looks of the gravel up on the metal toolbox, against the back window, and more gravel over the tailgate on the bumper, I'd say some rock was flung today, in reckless abandon.Even Steven has either staged a reckoning, or is planning one. The Pony went to eat his lunch today, a lunch planned since this morning, of a bowl of cereal, and found that the cupboard was bare of his box. From which he had eaten only one bowl since purchase. The whole time we were in town, when I asked both boys several times if they wanted to pick up something for lunch, The Pony said, \"No. I'm having cereal, remember?\" I asked Genius why he didn't let us know that he had eaten it. So we could have gotten more while in town. Or something else for lunch.\"I really wasn't even listing to either of you.\"No cereal. No brakes. Even Steven is a harsh taskmaster. Genius had better be hoping that his Stevening is still being planned. That the brakes were the initiating factor, and that something good lies on the horizon."}, {"title": "The Autumn of Our Discomfort", "date": "Tuesday, July 16, 2013", "text": "Money makes the world go round, but it's who you know that greases the axle.Shortly after we married, Hick and I decided to upgrade my newly-purchased $17,000 house. No, it was not the early 1900s, and we were not renovating a mansion. It was the cusp between the '80s and the '90s. My new old one-bedroom house was on a corner lot near the four-way stop that marked the \"downtown\" area of the 5000-person metropolis where I grew up.We decided to put a computer nook into the living room. It was, after all, the dawning of the home computer age. The nook entailed knocking out part of the front wall to add an alcove. Hick had just the man for the job. Though a handyman himself, Hick was working in the city, raking in overtime, and gone for 14 hours a day. So he hired a guy he knew who was an excellent finish carpenter. The guy, Woody, worked construction during the day, and did side projects and roofing for cash in his spare time.Woody showed up bright and early on a Saturday in mid-October. His intention was to knock out part of the front wall and get the section framed so he could enclose it Sunday. Then he could finish the interior the next weekend. We would be snug and under roof in the meantime.Hick knew Woody from way back. He paid him half the money up front, with the rest to come upon completion. They had measured, decided on materials, and Hick bought them at a salvage store. It was a bargain for all involved. Woody was a stand-up guy who didn't take crap from anybody. He looked like D.B. Sweeney as Dish Boggett in Lonesome Dove, the miniseries.The demolition went well. By evening, Woody had framed the nook, and covered the opening with blue tarp. He was confident that we would be under roof the next day. We had chosen this weekend specifically, because the weather forecast was clear and not frosty. It was not yet Halloween. Indian Summer was in effect.Sunday dawned. Woody was conspicuously absent. All day. The work week loomed. We had a hole in the front of our house. Hick was mildly perturbed. \"That's not like Woody. He's dependable. He must have run into some trouble.\" This was the era before cell phones. I'm not even sure Woody had a home phone. Hick usually knew where his kind of workers hung out, and simply dropped in to hire them for his off-the-books jobs.I was not worried about the weather getting in. I was worried about people getting in. Namely, strange people who stopped at all hours at the house across the street. Stopped for ten or fifteen minutes, often with a person waiting in the car, then left, never to return. It's not like family was visiting. \"What's going on over there? It looks suspicious. Is that a drug house?\" I had gone to school with the dude whose father lived there. Dude lived there sometimes, and lived on the family farm the rest of the time. I had not known him to be a drughead in school, but something was fishy.Hick disagreed. \"They're not dealing drugs. The old man is a bail bondsman. People are showing up to get bail money. Not drugs.\" Like that made me feel any better about the clientele who could sit in the car and observe the blue tarp wall keeping them from walking in to see if anything was worth stealing while we were both in the city, working.Monday went by with no word from Woody. Tuesday passed, Woodyless. Then Hick solved the mystery. \"Hey! I read the court report in the paper. Woody has been locked up in the county jail for bar-fighting. He'll be back to finish the job when he gets out. I knew there was a logical explanation.\" Thank goodness our blue tarp wall was not broached by anything besides insects.Woody showed up the next weekend. The nook turned out well. In fact, we also used Woody to build on a second bedroom, replace the sub-floor, expand the bathroom, and frame and roof our current home. He does quality work, that Woody.I don't know if he used our neighborhood bail bondsman.********************************************************Thanks to Joe H., the Cranky Old Man, for reminding me of this story today."}, {"title": "Shout, Shout, Another Thing I Can Do Without", "date": "Monday, July 15, 2013", "text": "Hick received a call from his doctor's office this evening. He only picked it up because he happened to be walking by the phone at the time, to awaken a napping Genius and goad him into helping Hick unload his truck so he had room to haul more junk. More about that another day. I couldn't help overhear the confidential medical record conversation. Seems Hick had dropped in to the doctor's office to give some blood for a lab test while he was on vacation. The results were not good. They were SO not good, in fact, that Hick came home telling me that the staff could not even give him a result. The measurement was off the charts. That's when he confessed to not taking one of his medications on a regular basis. The doctor sent him down to the hospital lab a couple towns over for further testing.Tonight's call was to alert Hick to the fact that his lab results were in, and everything was JUST FINE. He questioned the messenger. \"So I'm going to live? Huh.\" How come the office results showed that he was whistling past the graveyard, knocking on Death's door, and barging right in while Death was still slipping into his Grim Reaper uniform? Of course they had no explanation. But Hick and his informant made plans for him to drop in and discuss renewing prescriptions at the end of the week. You'd have thought he was planning the Invasion of Normandy, or that my mom and I were planning a rendezvous to exchange leftovers, such was the intricate dance of details bandied about over the land lines.It's not that I wanted to eavesdrop on Hick's health details. I couldn't avoid them. Not with a pillow pressed firmly over my head (no doubt a long-running fantasy of Hick's), not with jet-engine headphone ear-protectors, not with my ear canals hermetically sealed with soundproof cement. Hick is a telephone loud-talker. I'm sure you all know one. A person who has not yet entered the golden age of information.A telephone lets a person miles away from you hear your voice. It's magical. You don't have to shout so they can hear you through the compression waves that sound uses to travel through air. There's a talky thing that converts your voice so it goes through a wire and comes out a heary thing on the other end! You'd think Hick would be aware of this newfangled technology. But he's not. He's like that neighbor...of Doolittle Lynn, when Doo took Loretty out of Butcher Holler and moved her clear across the country to Washington state, where she sat on the front porch of their shack with her two toddlers, kicking the washing machine, writing songs on that guitar Doo bought her instead of a wedding ring...who had to walk to the edge of the field and yell that Loretty's mommy had called to say her daddy died. That's because Loretty didn't have a phone. Thus the hollering. It's not necessary with a phone. Not even with a tin-can-and-twine phone like we made as kids.I won't go on about the mechanisms and physics involved with cell phones. But I WILL tell you that you do not want to be closed up in a Tahoe with Hick when he talks on one."}, {"title": "I Sigh With a Little Help From My Friends", "date": "Sunday, July 14, 2013", "text": "Let's talk about drugs. The care and dosing of, specifically. Some people go to extremes. I'm sure you have already guessed that Val is the voice of reason. I swear, you must have some kind of psychic powers. It's the people around Val who don't know what they're doing, of course. Hick is a bit lackadaisical in the drug dosage department. Just this week, his doctor called him out on some lab results. \"Oh. That one. I take it. But I don't take it every time. Oh. The insurance says I haven't filled it in three months? Well. I still have some left.\" Yeah. The doctor wasn't buyin' Hick's excuses. He doesn't realize that Hick is one of those corner-cutters. A person who is not precise on certain things, but overly precise on others.Take cough medicine, for example. The last time Hick was very sick and missed work and had some prescription cough medicine, he took it around the clock. \"It says, 'Take every 4-6 hours.' So I take it every four hours. It says so. On the label. The doctor must want me to sleep, because it knocks me out. Am I coughing? No. I'm asleep. Because I take my medicine like it says.\"Hick did not want to hear about the \"as needed\" part of the label. He was sure he was supposed to take it on schedule, 24/7, until it was gone. Unlike antibiotics, which he only takes until he feels better. Even though the label says to take them on schedule until gone. But getting back to that cough medicine...for one so strict on the dosage administration, Hick was a bit careless in the measuring department. Forget that little plastic cup the pharmacy puts in. The label said \"teaspoons\". So Hick was sure he had to take that medicine with a spoon. To Hick, any spoon is a teaspoon. Any spoon except a measuring teaspoon in the kitchen. It could be a silverware spoon from various sets, a serving spoon, a baby food spoon, or perhaps a big wooden decorative spoon off a kitchen wall-hanging arrangement. It's a spoon, by cracky! And the instructions said to use a spoon.We have a veritable home pharmacy above the stove. Aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen. You got a headache? We've got the remedy. Here's the problem with our over-the-counter, over-the-oven stash: the lids. Hick thinks the lids should be spun away from that line-up arrow thingy. Like the medicine will fall out of the bottle all willy-nilly, because that lid won't stay on. Either that, or he expects a roving band of headachy toddlers to invade our kitchen with the sole purpose of prying open medicine caps that are not set in the childproof mode. I don't know how many times I've gone to pop out a pill and ripped half the fingerprint off my thumb because the arrows were not lined up like I left them. I can't count them on two hands, because my fingers are too sore for counting, what with their ripped-off fingerprints.My mom errs more on the side of caution. A while back, I had given her a couple of acetaminophen, and a couple of ibuprofen. That's because The Pony takes one kind for a headache, and Genius takes the other. Every now and then their noggin commences to throbbin' while they're soaking up Grandma's high-speed internet, and she had asked me for something to keep on hand. She's not one to pop pills, my mom.So a month or two ago, Mom stuffed a Walmart sack with plastic containers that I had given her leftovers in, and some snacks for the boys, and those old pills. \"I'm giving these back to you because I've had them for quite a while, and I'm pretty sure they're expired now.\" You know. Because she couldn't simply throw them away, or bury them in the backyard, or seal them hermetically in a jar with a Mr. Yuk sticker on the front.

And right below it, a more expensive fee had been added. Of course Genius had just stepped into the shower. So we had a muffled conversation.\"Hey! Can you hear me?\"\"What? Talk louder!\"\"CAN I CRACK THE DOOR?\"\"Okay.\"\"I think they switched your dorm. They subtracted the fee, and added a different one.

He only told me this morning when I asked what he'd been texting about yesterday when I thought he was getting in the pool.At first, The Pony told me he didn't think he'd go. More interrogation revealed that plans for the party included dancing and pizza and a bonfire. I know The Pony is a pizza boy. So I asked him, \"Do you like to dance?\"\"Um. What do YOU think? No.\"\"Do you like to burst into flames.\"\"Well, you should know that the answer to that would be, 'Hopefully, no.'\"\"I'm sure there will be girls there who would love to teach you to dance.\"\"Uh, no.\"The Pony went off to let out the goats.

This is a kids' movie, so I expected a bunch of kid stuff. Lots of getting up and going to the bathroom and getting refills and hollering at the screen. From the kids, too. Of course there were those who rolled in at 15 minutes past the show time and stood in the aisle deciding where to inflict the backs of their heads on those of us who got there early. The daycare contingent who took up two rows got there in plenty of time to stake out their territory in the middle of the theater. The two adults with them had ONE popcorn bag. I envisioned those kids passing it along the row, taking one kernel at a time, sharing like the large family of Rita-the-rat in Flushed Away sharing that one bowl of soup as it slid from one end of the table to the other as their houseboat tilted to and fro. That's one of my favorite animated movies. Check it out if you have the chance. My personal favorite is the scene where the sewer slugs sing, \"Poor old Roddy, flushed down his own potty...\" But I digress.We had our regular next-to-the-back-row seats. Nobody sat directly in front of us. A lady and her grandson came in and sat behind us just as the previews started. All was well until the movie itself began. Then they pulled something out of their pockets or purse that drove me crazy. I don't know what it was, but my ears told me it was some kind of candy wrapped in cellophane. You know cellophane. It crinkles. It can't be tamed. Can't be worn out. Can't be quieted. When The Pony has a box of candy, say, for instance, Cookie Dough Bites, that are enclosed in cellophane inside the box, I tell him to dump those tasty tidbits right into the box. Get rid of the cellophane. If only I could give such sage advice to other people's children. Or grandchildren.That kid was a world-class cellophane rustler. It was like he was digging to China in the bottom of that bag. Like he couldn't eat what was on top, but had to dig out the deepest morsel for each bite. He must have been practicing to be the Guinness World Record Movie Cellophane Rustler. He probably had a plexiglass case lined with red velvet for when the Olympic Committee adds cellophane rustling as a sport. That racket went on for over half an hour. The Pony was oblivious.

He shaves his head, and kind of has bug-eyes, and I wasn't expecting anybody to have followed me down my 1/8 mile driveway, so I was scared. He just wanted me to tell Hick that he had all the papers ready for the land he stole from us that we are buying back at an outrageous profit for him. That's all.Jury Duty Dude Who Looked Like Hannibal Lecter who was supposed to sit right next to me on the pew in the courtroom, but refused to enter that row, and went to the one behind. He was so scary that the deputy reading off our names did not correct him. It might have been because he asked why she wasn't wearing her badge, and asked for her name, and slowly licked the dull lead on a nub of a pencil and wrote it down on a tiny flip-top spiral notebook that he took out of his gray prison-issue-looking slacks. Befuddled Jury Duty Lady Who Convicted Innocent People, her proclaiming that she could tell, just by looking, that those folks were guilty. She was referring to other prospective jurors who were sitting near the judge's chambers with doctors' letters hoping to be excused.Young Scofflaws on the Loose who ran up to soap the windows of the car while I was sitting in it in plain sight as Hick took the boys up to a house for trick-or-treating.Raincoatless Flasher Dude who called me over to his car to ask if I had the time, me thinking he was shirtless because it was summer, and that he wanted me to check my watch, not his...Odd Lady in a Master's Class who turned to me and asked, \"What if you have bruises all over your body and you don't even play volleyball?\"Countless People Who Ask if I Work Here, no matter whether I'm walking through Walmart, a casino, a school not my own, a college science fair, a museum in Mississippi, a shoe store, etc. I am everyclerk.Generous Addled Man in Save A Lot who came up behind me while I was boxing my groceries, put his hand on my shoulder, and held out a wad of money. \"Here.\"Oh, dear. I'm leaving out so many. I've had no time to accurately catalog them. I know the Pink Panty Drunk Driver lady is missing, and the guy who hollered, \"Every man's dream!\" when I ordered two breasts and two thighs at the Gas Station Chicken Store. Not to mention the Walmart parking lot ZZ Top beard guy who told me how he was waiting for his friend to buy some lettuce for a salad to go with their spaghetti, or the casino frat boy who literally pulled my crank, or the mouthy woman at the movie theater who spouted off to my niece (blood is thicker than popcorn), or the doctor's receptionist who gave me a work excuse after surgery for an entirely different woman.So many weirdos, so little time."}, {"title": "The Universe Works Overtime", "date": "Monday, July 8, 2013", "text": "Ahh...the universe must be looking for time-and-a-half on next week's paycheck, what with the extra hours it has put into conspiring against me.Perhaps I mentioned that the Gas Station Chicken Store befouled my precious fountain of Diet Coke. I gave them over a week to remedy the situation, but the taste was still like Diet Pepsi or the dregs of a chicken-pen water pan. So I switched my loyal beverage patronage to Voice of the Village. All was well. I had a new routine.Today I went to the bank for the little matter of reclaiming my debit card that was eaten by the ATM just because I drove away without touching the screen to say that I was finished and wanted it to return my card. Kind of petty for that ATM to retaliate so harshly due to my lack of caress. I pulled into the bank parking lot, careful to avoid the car coming out the entrance, because, you know, nothing is THAT simply for Val on her daily excursions. The teller inside said that sure, she could get my card back, but it would take a lot of paperwork, and two employees. Not that she wanted to make me feel guilty or anything. She did, however, exact revenge by asking to see my ID, which, of course, is my DRIVER'S LICENSE. I swear, I've had to show that hideous likeness more times this summer than in the previous seven years, when I had one that was quite fetching.That teller was gone for a while. I'm supposed to think that it took time for the forms and the buddy system to crack open the ATM. But I think in all actuality they were yukking it up and Instagramming my bloated, misshapen, droopy-lidded countenance willy-nilly through the major social networks. Once I had my debit card and, unfortunately, my driver's license back, The Pony and I headed towards home, with a quick stop at Voice of the Village for my 44 oz. Diet Coke.I grabbed my cup and the correct change, and joyfully exited T-Hoe and entered the establishment. I mentally patted myself on the back after making it through the door before the dude carrying his toddler daughter. They looked like soda fountain people. Slow ones. I rushed past the place where I saw that giant fruit beetle, wove past the Natural Light display, and saw two signs taped to the dispenser of happiness: OUT OF ORDER.WTNH! Remember that? WHAT THE NOT-HEAVEN! Imagine the odds of the two mainstays of my caffeine habit going down at the same time. After two years of steadfast service. Darn you, Universe! Darn you all to heck! Can you see me shaking my fist skyward, toward the cosmos?I turned on my rubber-soled heel, a feat made easier by the melted-ice water droplets on the red concrete floor. Back through the Natural Light display, the former beetle territory, and out the door. Foiled again! Back to the Gas Station Chicken Store. The congenial man with one tooth was clerking. He greeted me pleasantly. The owner was lurking in the back near the beer cooler. I thought of mentioning the befouled Diet Coke. But I didn't. Owner had been so discombobulated that time he poured the hot coffee water into the soda fountain and sent up a cloud of steam while I was drawing my drought that I feared he could not handle bad news of this magnitude. I clunked in a few ice cubes. And threw caution to the wind, and pushed my styrofoam cup against the lever. It LOOKED normal. Not too foamy. I slapped on a lid and paid. Once in the privacy of T-Hoe's tinted windows, I took my water-cup straw and pierced the X marking the spot. One tiny sip. It was okay!That was a good thing. Because for the quarter-mile drive under the overpass to get to the Gas Station Chicken Store, I had been panicking about what to do. What if that soda was still Diet Pepsi-ish? Where would I go. I asked The Pony. He was not much help, not being an addict, not grasping the magnitude of the situation. \"Does that liquor store have a soda fountain?\" I don't know why I asked him. It's not like he could drive himself to town on the sly.\"How would I know?\"\"Sorry. Some of them do. My old haircutter used to leave her teenage son money to walk to the liquor store for a soda while she was at work. Now where else could I go? Subway? Do they have Coke or Pepsi? They won't let me bring in my big cup. Are there any other gas stations? Oh! The Casey's! I can go there if I have to!\"Lucky for me, my thirst was slaked at my old pal, the Gas Station Chicken Store. It's hard placating this monkey on my back."}, {"title": "Punishment For the Good-Deeder", "date": "Sunday, July 7, 2013", "text": "The universe has not taken a holiday from conspiring against Val.I found out Saturday morning that Hick is laying in hay stores for the winter. Uh huh. Who woulda thunk that July is the time to buy winter hay? Not me. Because last year we bought winter hay in the winter. Or tried to. Because hay was scarce. Apparently, people had not been making hay last summer when the sun shone at 108 degrees for several weeks. So our goats had to eat goat chow, or whatever they eat when there is no hay, no bark left on the cedar trees in their pen, and no tin cans laying around.Because Hick was going right then, that morning, to hook up his truck to a trailer of 75 square bales to haul it home and wake up Genius to stack in under the BARn lean-to...I had to cough up a couple of hundred bucks in cash. Not only that, but Genius was strong-arming me to pay for half a monitor. Yes. Half a monitor. He bought a whole one, but thought I should pay half, because it's for college. For his laptop to hook up to, and to use as a TV. Last time I checked, laptops came with screens. But you know how I am out-of-touch with technology. So I figured I could scrape up the money, then go take some out of our account at the bank's ATM. The Pony could ride with me, logging some front-seat time as decreed by Hick.This good deed cost me dearly.The Pony does not like riding up front. We have compromised. He rides shotgun on the way to where we're going, and he rides behind me on the way back. What his dad doesn't know won't hurt him. As we started into the garage, I said, \"Up front, remember? Dad says.\"\"He didn't say anything about THIS trip. That was last time.\"\"No. He means EVERY time.\" The Pony sighed and hopped in. I ran in Save A Lot, another part of the good deed, because Hick wanted more meat for grilling. Gotta keep the new auction grill, Gassy G, in business. He's like the opposite of the boiler at the Overlook Hotel. We don't have to watch him like an Excedrin-chomping Jack Torrance to dump the pressure, we have to furnish him with neverending sacrificial flesh. If denied, Gassy G might grow grumpy, and growl at us like the furnace in that Home Alone boy's basement.We continued to the bank. I lectured The Pony as I went through the motions, \"Always be aware of your surroundings. Lock your doors if you're in the car at the ATM.\" I took out my exact amount. Counted it to make sure the machine didn't short me ten dollars like the human at my mom's bank. I drove around through the back alley so The Pony could hop into the back seat. \"Do it here, at the stop sign. There's nothing behind us. I'll put my money away before we go to Sonic for your lunch. Wait a minute! WHERE'S MY DEBIT CARD?\"Yes. I had left it in the machine, being discombobulated by the new timing of my cash trip, the new amount, the new front-seat companion. You know how it's the little things that can throw you off your game. \"What time it is? Oh, no. It's almost noon. Let's go back and see if it's in the machine. Hopefully, nobody else had gone through the cash machine. I'm not going backwards up the alley. Here. Let's cut across this lot and go back.\" Of course fifteen cars were going our way, impeding my pull-out. The Pony watched them like a hawk.\"Nobody went into the bank lot, Mom!\"\"No? Probably because they're closing at noon.\" I went to the ATM. It had already gone back to new customer mode. I backed up and entered one of the three drive-thru bays. The workers were milling around at the front counter area, not at the drive-thru post. \"Excuse me! I think I left my debit card in the ATM. Could you please check and see if it's there?\"\"I'm sorry, Ma'am. We're not allowed to open the ATM until Monday. You'll have to check back then.\"No rest for the weary, no joy in Mudville, no cash for the stupid.

Step through, and hold it open in an act of chivalry. Chivalry is not dead. It lives! It lives in the egresses of my humble home, where the menfolk see fit to invite in poopy-foot flies until the cows come home. Thank goodness we don't have cows.If I had my druthers, my family would be required to enter our abode like Indiana Jones creeping through the Temple of Doom. Like Tom Cruise trying to complete an impossible mission. Like Maxwell Smart striding though closing doors at CONTROL headquarters. Or to exit like Maria slipping out the front door of the von Trapp mansion during a grand party.Flies have no business in my house. There's no poop to crawl on. That's their job, you know. To crawl on poop. Don't tell me how flies like decomposing critter carcasses just as well. Nope. I know what they're up to. They're poop-crawlers. That's what they live for. That's how they live. Sure, every now and then you hear of them laying their eggs in decomposing critter carcasses. They're just using them as surrogates because they can't find enough poop to crawl in. Poop, poop, poop. That's their mantra.I show no mercy when they come poopy-footing around my kitchen. I grab the old-fashioned baby-blue flyswatter that hangs from a metal hook on the cutting block. \"Feast your compound eyes on THIS!\" I hiss. In my mind. Out loud might make my chivalrous menfolk look at me askance. The poopy-footed guest today was invited by The Pony after our trip to town. \"Close that door! What are you trying to do, let in flies?\"\"I'm going back to the car for my phone. I was holding the door for you. Look out. This one's trying to get in. Too late.\"Yes. Too late. For that poop-crawler. I grabbed my swatter. The Pony had returned. \"I just saw him. Where did he go?\"\"Um. Right there. On YOUR FOOT!\" Huh. Like he thought I could feel a fly on the instep of my white leather New Balance. Some reverse princess detecting a pea.\"Watch this!\"\"Haha! He got away!\"\"Not for long. Where'd he go?\"\"Right here. On the floor.\"\"He's not very smart.\"\"Let ME get him.\" I handed over the swatter while I busied myself getting my 44 oz. Diet Coke ready for transport to my dark basement lair. \"Oops! Missed.\" I took back my swatter and sent The Pony packing my drinks downstairs. That poop-crawler landed on a metal tray on my almond stove-top. I swung without mercy. Like a clean-up hitter going for the left field fence. Some might term my at-bat as a foul. The poop-crawler tried to take off. Too late. He must have been suffering from multiple macular degeneration. I struck him a glancing blow, which caused him to fly in a slow spiral into the drip pan of my front burner. Don't think I was giving up.I pulled up the metal coil and dipped the edge of the flyswatter under the poop-crawler. He walked in a circle like a puppy chasing its tail. Only much smaller, and not cute. I spun to the sink, and dumped him in. Turned on the water full blast. Grabbed the sprayer for good measure. That's one poop-crawler that's not coming back.Later, I told The Pony, \"I got him! I smacked him on the stove, and he flew into the burner, and I scooped him out and washed him down the sink.\"\"I know. I heard the death scream.\" I'm not sure if he's talking about one from the poop-crawler, or from me. \"I would have turned on the burner and roasted him to ashes.\"So much for chivalry."}, {"title": "'Tis Not Nobler To Suffer", "date": "Friday, July 5, 2013", "text": "The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune rained down on me today. Yes, there was no joy in Backroads. Cranky Val bad-lucked out.Perhaps I have mentioned in passing that I enjoy a 44 oz. Diet Coke on special occasions. Like the dawning of each new day. I travel with a stable of styrofoam cups to grab a refill while I'm out and about. I frequent two establishments in downtown Backroads. No need to travel far and wide for my caffeiney fix. I used to enjoy Sonic Happy Hour on the way home from work, until Sonic made it Unhappy Hour by altering the half-price time so I could not get there, and then had the gall to go out of business (no doubt due to my lack of patronage), and the road that ran down Sonic fast-food row was closed for a new bridge.My go-to re-filling stations are the Gas Station Chicken Store and Voice of the Village. Yeah. Those are made-up names. But anybody from these parts would know what I'm talking about. I've had an issue of late with the Gas Station Chicken Store. Last week, I happily filled my cup, dropped my exact change into the cashier's hand, and practically pranced out the door with that 44 oz. Diet Coke in my hot little hand. Mmm. I never put a straw in it there. I take it home, and use recycled straws that I wash out. It's not like a long straw is a hardship, what with the 84 pieces of silverware I have to wash each day. Once home, I plop that cup into a spare cup, thus double-cupping and keeping my elixir cool throughout the day. The Pony carries it downstairs and puts it on my desk, where it awaits my imbibing. After drinking a bit, I add ice from Frig, also carried down by The Pony, in a Bubba cup to use as needed. I sip this delightful beverage over the course of six hours or so.On that fateful day last week, I leaned over to swill the first gulp, and IT TASTED FOUL! Foul, I tell you! Not like there was a moldy mouse in the cup. I would have noticed that. It tasted foul! Like Diet Pepsi! I can hardly type those words. I'm retching as I remember. It was all I could do to drink half of it. So put-off was I by this betrayal that I shunned the Gas Station Chicken Store. I bestowed my business on Voice of the Village. It's 27 cents cheaper there, and sometimes FREE, depending on who's behind the counter. On the down side, they don't sell chicken.Today I decided to give the Gas Station Chicken Store another chance. I was sure it was a simple error. They have the Pepsi machine right next to the Coke machine. An honest mistake. I saw it as a good sign that my favorite parking place nearest the door was available. I skipped in merrily with my cup, almost expecting the employees to call out, \"VAL!\" Because sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name. I sidled up to the Coke machine, clunked in several cubes of ice, and began the refilling. But this time, I grabbed a straw and stabbed it through the thin plastic skin of the lid. Ptuey! IT TASTED FOUL! Same as last week. I got in line to pay, because I am sure that in a court of law, \"IT TASTED FOUL!\" is not an adequate defense. The sweet older lady whose little fluffy dog was eaten by her neighbor's dog several months ago said, \"Hey, where you been?\" That's proper grammar for this area.\"Your Diet Coke doesn't taste right. I noticed it last week. It tastes like Diet Pepsi. So...I've been getting my soda somewhere else.\" Because I'm a stand-up gal, I bought two lottery tickets. Gotta give some good with the bad.\"It tastes like Diet Pepsi? I just refilled it. It said 'Coke' on the box...\"\"I don't know what happened, but it doesn't taste like Diet Coke.\"\"Huh.\" Yeah. She gave the same treatment I gave that weirdo hot-dog lady in Save A Lot the other day. I don't hold it against her.I took that tall cup of bilge-water out to T-Hoe, and made The Pony sample it. Against his wishes. It could be that I commanded all wrong. \"Taste this crap! It's nasty! What do you mean you'd rather not? Take a sip. It almost makes me sick! See? Does that taste like Diet Coke? What do you mean, 'Kinda?' Don't you know the difference in Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi? Or else they've got the carbonation way out of whack.\"\"It MIGHT taste a little like Diet Pepsi.\"\"Do you think your dad might want it if I take it home?\"\"No. Nobody wants that.\"I poured it out the window and headed straight for Voice of the Village. Even used the same cup. It was the best decision I made all day.

My cell phone was broken. I noticed it right before The Pony and I left home to stock up on barbecue supplies. I broached the subject with him, our discussion made all the more convenient because he was riding in the front seat of T-Hoe, orders from his dad. I began my line of questioning with the first of the usual suspects.Did you knock my phone off the cutting block?No.Are you sure. There's a crack in it. Look.Hmm. That IS a crack.You didn't do it?No. If I did, I would tell you. But I didn't.I noticed it last night. I left it on the cutting block, propped on its kickstand to get one bar, facing my purse on the counter. When I came upstairs in the wee hours, it was facing the stove, and moved over about six inches. I though I saw a long smudge, like from unlocking it. But it's a crack. Are you sure you didn't knock it off?No. Funny how you can drop a phone from three feet onto the garage floor numerous times, and it doesn't break. Yet tip it over onto its face, and it cracks in two places.Yeah. Funny. You know so much about it.That's what happened to MY phone.Uh huh. And you'd tell me if you cracked mine?Yes. It's ONLY a crack. It's not like your phone is broken. Mine has TWO cracks.And yours doesn't receive calls.Um. Well, it's fine for what I need it for. I don't need people interrupting me with calls.*************************************************************The next witness was out of our jurisdiction, and was contacted by phone. Hey, did you knock my phone off last night?No. Why?Because there's a big crack down the front.I didn't know that. It was fine the last time I looked at it.You didn't move it on the cutting block?No. Why would I do that?Because just before you left on vacation, you kept yelling at me to put it back on the counter.Well, it's stupid to put it on the cutting block. It's in the way.I see. So you didn't even touch it.No.**************************************************************The third witness took more finesse. He's a clever one. Evasive. But not well-versed in the nuances of interrogation. He also gave testimony by phone.Did you pick up my phone?Pick up you phone?Yes. Did you pick up my phone?No. Don't you have it?Yes. But it was moved on the cutting block, and facing a different way.Well, I brought in Chinese food last night when we got home.Did you put the bag on the cutting block?No. I put it on the counter by the stove, where I always put it.You didn't move my phone?No. The Chinese food got put there.What do you mean?The boys were getting out their food. And the bag got put on the cutting block.Did you put it there?No. It got put there.You sound like a liar. Who says, \"It got put there.\" A normal person would say \"I put it there.\" Or \"Genius put it there.\" Or even, \"The boys put it there.\" Yet you say, \"It got put there.\"I'm not a liar.Remember that time with the paper towels? You swore you didn't use them. Then you swore you didn't get your dirty fingerprints on the end of the new roll again. And I found out you had flipped the roll upside down on the holder, and there were dirty fingerprints all over that end. Right? Do you remember?Yes. I remember. I DID flip the paper towels so you wouldn't know I got them dirty again.But you told me you hadn't used the paper towels, didn't you?Yes. I told you that.THAT WAS JUST A ROLL OF PAPER TOWELS! I can imagine how you'd lie about breaking my cell phone.I didn't touch your cell phone. I'll bet GENIUS did it!***********************************************************What say you, jury?THE PONY with a condiment cup of sweet & sour sauce by Frig?GENIUS with a carton of fried rice, a carton of chicken, and a styrofoam tub of sweet & sour sauce by the stove?HICK with a paper sack full of Chinese takeout, and misdirection?They all have flaws in their testimony. Yet they stick to their stories, and don't flinch when I point out their inconsistencies. My circumstantial evidence cannot rule out any of the three. I think I'll just lock them up in a shared cell to commiserate for eternity like Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer.************************************************************BREAKING: Val, the judge, jury, and executioner, has declared a mistrial. After this story went to press, just before publication, new developments occurred, brought to the court's attention by one of the defendants. The circumstances are a bit sketchy, but previous evidence seems to have been destroyed.************************************************************Genius arrived home from a sleepover. He showered. He stormed out. He slammed the door. He apparently had a rendezvous with Hick involving physical labor, which may or may not have included a discussion of PhoneBreak. He entered the kitchen to forage for sustenance. I, in the living room, heard water running in the kitchen sink. For a long time.I thought you said your phone was broken.It is. Down the front glass.No it isn't.Yes, it is. The Pony saw it himself. PONY! Did you see the crack in my phone?That's what you told me.You know you saw it in the car yesterday. You ran your finger over it and said it WAS a crack.If you say so.Look! There's NO crack.Well, it was there yesterday. I tried everything to get it off, and I could feel the crack. One piece pushed down, and it was a definite crack.Look. It's fine.Huh.If I didn't know better, I would have sworn that Genius had a spare glass phone face thingy laying around like Frankenstein parts, and that he replaced it. Or else he gave my smart phone a shower under the kitchen faucet. One scenario is as disturbing as the other.

I don't ask for much. Time to write. A 44 oz. Diet Coke every day. World peace. And the opportunity to dash into Save A Lot unmolested both physically and emotionally by crackpots.Hick is planning to use his new auction grill, Gassy G, tonight and tomorrow. He asked me to pick up some meat. Yeah. Our little Hick is growing up. He understands that I would rather make a trip to town than haul some Auction Meat out of the deep freeze.I buy my meat at Save A Lot. They have their own butcher, you know. And they don't inject their meat with water like Walmart. They don't slap a new date sticker on it like it's good for one more day, and mark it down. They run a clean shop with tasty carcass cuts, and make their own bratwurst, which my mom loves as much as the slaw she puts on it. They also have packaged meat like jumbo hot dogs. I was sent for hamburger, pork steaks, and jumbo hot dogs.There I was, minding my own business on the cold-cut section of the meat aisle that runs across the back of the store. I was piloting my cart with bananas, tomatoes, and pickles already ensconced in that child seat area. A blond woman hustled up from the opposite end of the meat counter. She came at me like a teenage car-texter out for her first solo drive. I was elbow deep in the jumbo hot dogs, making sure the dates were good. I've never had a problem with that in Save A Lot, but I have at the grocery store three blocks away, so I always check. I pushed my cart away from the cooler, thinking Blondie might want some cured processed meat. And she did.Could Blondie simply grab her meat and walk away? If you're a regular visitor to Val's Cat-Unbagging Emporium, I'm sure you know the answer to that rhetorical question. Not-Heaven NO! Blondie was jonesin' for some small talk. Some hyper, coked-up, energy-drinked-up, guilty-conscienced, overcompensating-for-undiagnosed-bulimia, Cheri-Oteri-without-the-cheerleader-uniform-and-Collette-Reardon-makeup, small talk to throw Val off her fresh-jumbo-hot-dog-seeking mission.\"I should get those.

What The Not-Heaven? Do you think it'll catch on? Like \"fetch\" did for Gretchen Wieners? Now keep in mind, Blondie had that pack of tiny hot dogs in her hand the whole time. She was not rooting me out to put them back, or pick up more, or grab the jumbos. Just waggling that wiener-pack and babbling like I was some hot-dog guru with my own reality show. Did I look like a person who would care about what she feeds her dog? Was she overcompensating for being a dog-lover (and I mean that in the way Will Ferrell and Rachel Dratch were hot-tub lovers). Did I look like the dog police? Like somebody who gave a pile of dog crap what her dog prefers for snacks? Like a blogger in need of a post?WTNH, lady. You're telling me that the food I'm buying for my family is something you should give your dog? And I'm supposed to smile and chat? You've pointed out that your dog won't eat HEALTHY food, so you should give him this? Why don't you smear a little Grey Poupon on it, you snob? Serve it out of a crystal goblet like those cat food commercial ladies. A real Fancy Feast for Fido. You'd think I had scooped up a bucketful of offal from the slaughterhouse floor with a pooper scooper, the way Blondie was on me like flies on dog poo without a baggie half full of water and six pennies nearby.I need to carry a little voice recorder.

Nothing is ever that simple when the two of us go out on the town. First of all, we give that movie a glowing recommendation. It's not for the folks who don't like pottymouths, but it IS hilarious. Besides, we saw it for only $4 a ticket, the first showing of the day. That's a bargain. Also, it was time to renew my AMC movie rewards card for $12. But get this! By renewing, I got $10 free at the concession stand. So it only cost me $2 to renew. AND that gets me upgrades and rewards over the next year. But I'm not here to Alec Baldwin/Capitol One for AMC. I'm here to share our full movie-going experience with you.The show was at 11:15. Normally, I like to get to the movies about 30 minutes before showtime. That pretty much guarantees me my back row seats of choice. However, the last several times we've gone to a morning showing, there was just a smattering of patrons in our theater. So this time, we arrived a scant 15 minutes before the start time. The parking lot was half full! Mom and I scurried to the door. A woman and her teenage daughter beat us to the ticket-taker. One of these days, I'm going to be able to keep up with Mom.That teenage ticketmeister took his own sweet time. People were lined up getting snacks. I tapped my foot and willed TickyPickySavvy to get with the program. I told Mom I wished we had arrived earlier. TPS fiddled around with my card. Told me it was time to renew, even though a couple weeks ago he told me I had a month left. \"Yes. Do it now. I'll renew.\" For the love of festival seating, do it NOW. Then TPS couldn't quite figure out which part of the ticket to stuff in that metal box, and which part to hand us, and how to explain about my Rewards card. Seems that the computer won't show I renewed, but if I showed the counter help my ticket stub, they would know. Sure. Gimme the tickets! He didn't even tell us which of the four theaters harbored our feature.Mom asked if I was getting snacks. She, herself, does not partake. Heavens no. That would be a waste of money. She does not appreciate the full movie-going experience. But she sure likes to take home a giant bag of popcorn and munch it in the car and have it later while watching her Cardinals on TV. So I always get the large bag that comes with a refill, just for her. Shh...don't let her know that. Before evil AMC bought out Kerasotes, ALL sizes were refillable. Not so now. Anyway, I told Mom that first, we had to secure our seats. We rushed willy-nilly about the four-plex, finding The Heat in the last theater we looked at.MY SEAT WAS UNPICKED! We sat down in the next-to-last row. A four-seater. I debated on moving back one, but decided we were good. I left Mom to hold the seats while I went out for popcorn and soda. Of course Mom did not want any. The popper was covered in bottom crumbs, so I took a detour to the bathroom. Best to be proactive. The Heat is almost two hours long. I went back to check on Mom. Three women had sat down in the row right in front of us! Not at the end of their eight-seat row. RIGHT IN FRONT OF US! Mom asked if I wanted to move back. No. We're already set. Somebody worse could move in front if we moved back. Perhaps a contingent of wide-shouldered, big-haired pro wrestlers who really love Sandra Bullock.The previews had already started, with sound, even, and it was 11:15. I went back for my snacks. The popper was popping like a champ. Just before I rounded the candy rack to get in line at the only side of the counter that was open...five dudes got ahead of me. You know that that means. First of all, they were there for that Man of Steel movie. Secondly, they were each going to pay individually. Because they're dudes. We inched forward. At the last minute, two dudes decided they weren't all that hungry. They stepped out of line. Two others just got drinks. The last got a little combo. The popper's last kernels cascaded onto the fluffy hot popcorn mountain. The timing was perfect.I showed the girl my ticket and Rewards card. Refused the soda upgrade, because a large cup is too unwieldy. And I asked her three times which bag was the refillable popcorn bag. She said the large, even though two weeks ago they gave us the bucket. She filled my soda. AND HANDED ME A LARGE POPCORN THAT WAS ALREADY IN A BAG ON THE SHELF BEHIND HER! The horror! No way was I going to pay their exorbitant prices for stale popcorn. Much to the chagrin of the line behind me, I asked, \"Why do I have to get THAT bag of popcorn? I don't want one off the shelf. I want fresh popcorn. Can't I get it bagged out of the popper?\"\"This IS fresh popcorn.\"\"Not out of the popper. I've been waiting for it to pop. Can't I get a bag out of the popper?\"\"Sure.\" Her mouth said yes, but her eyes and shoulders disagreed. Then she rang it up and said, \"That will be fifty cents.\" Haha! I got my fresh popcorn AND my $10 off. High from my victory, I returned to the theater. There was a weird man in the seat behind mine. Mom said, a bit too loudly, \"Do you want to move to a different row?\" I shook my head and handed her the popcorn while I manipulated the flipping seat. The weird guy behind me sighed. He got up and went four rows down. Yeah! Victory number two for Val and her mom. Seriously. What kind of weird bald middle-aged guy goes to see a Sandra Bullock movie by himself and sits in the back row? No weirdo I want behind me, that's for sure.Twenty minutes and ten previews later, our movie started. A woman and a man with a cane came in and sat behind us. Oh, well. They knew what they were getting into. It just meant that Mom and I could not talk during the movie, across the empty seat that held our purses, the large popcorn, and my soda. I don't know why I worried about being considerate, because about ten minutes later, one of those two people in the only row behind us dumped an entire soda onto the concrete floor. It must have been the extra-large keg nearly the size of a popcorn bucket. The sound was like Niagara Falls. I wouldn't be surprised if our shoulders were coated with the spray. The guy with the cane who was directly behind me said, \"Did you get any on you?\" And he was not talking to me. Throughout the movie, every time I shifted in my chair and moved my feet, it was like my tractiony New Balance soles had been replaced with tiny Bambi hooves that scrabbled to gain purchase on an icy pond. Of course neither back-row dweller told the usher about their accident, at that time, or as they walked past him after the show was over.I dumped the dregs of the popcorn in the wastebasket, and got in line with my empty bag for Mom's refill. She got right in line with me, like a supervisor. Normally, she waits against the lobby wall. The girl on the other end of the counter that had tried to foist stale popcorn on me disappeared. One minute she was there, then she was gone. Her line still waited hopefully. The guy serving our line finished up with the lady and little girl ahead of us, and went to the other end of the counter. Darn that girl clerk and her spiteful, revengy ways! I had bested her fair and square, but she Even-Stevened me right back. The guy clerk saw the bag I put on the counter. \"Is that all you need, a refill?\" I nodded. \"I'll come get it for you.\" He pushed the soda filler button and scooped up Mom's fresh popcorn from the popper. She handed me my purse, and was crunching away before we were even out the door. I don't know why we can't have a normal, everyday outing without added drama. At least Mom left her tiny phone in the car."}, {"title": "It's All Over But the Roof-Cryin'", "date": "Monday, July 1, 2013", "text": "I think it's safe to let this cat out of the bag now.

Sunday I got the go-ahead to share this information.Short of me committing an unknown, unforgivable, prima donna faux pas, that little story, along with its 64 companions, went to print today. It should be released on September 10th. Yum, yum, get you some! My very own mother has already committed herself to three copies. Because I'm her nine-dollar daughter, you know. She's grabbing one copy for herself, and two for gifts. I'm sure the NYMB line will be able to survive on Mom's loyal business.Here's the cover:My tale is about a Hick-rigged lamp. You may think you know what it's like to share a domicile with a lesser-known MacGyver, but you have no idea. I didn't mention this in the story, because it's on a need-to-know basis. And as my loyal readers, you need to know: No headless basement men were harmed in the rigging of this lamp. That's a story for another anthology.Even if you don't feel like paying to read a Valerism when you can get the milk for free right here, consider other uses for this tome. It can prop a mean table leg, dispatch a creepy crawler, sit on your coffee table until you get a book about coffee tables, start a couple of hundred fires for you in survival mode, give you somewhere to look instead of making eye contact with strangers in waiting rooms, on subways, city buses, and the MetroLink. Start saving now. Don't let those trees die in vain. My doctor is already camping out in line for his free autographed copy.Oh, and I didn't disturb the rooftop peace back on June 2nd, but I have also been informed that my story about cheese-cutting will be included in Not Your Mother's Book...on Being a Parent. Also scheduled for release September 10, 2013.Two stories! In two books! Both being released on the same day! I'm going to call that a bifecta. A headband trick.

I'm a little fish in a big pond!"}, {"title": "Friday in the Park With Mom", "date": "Sunday, June 30, 2013", "text": "Okay, I didn't really spend Friday in the park with Mom. I picked her up at the park. Don't be hatin' because I didn't go all the way to her house. She wanted to meet. That's because she only had a quarter-tank of gas, and planned to get more. Never mind that her gas station of choice is a mile from her house, and the park is five. I deferred to her wishes.Hick and the boys had their own thing going on, and I had promised Mom that she could ride with me to a neighboring town to pay my house payment. No, I don't trade eggs and goats. It's a check. But if I mail it, I don't get a receipt, and I don't get cancelled checks. Besides, we had plans for lunch. You never turn Mom down when she suggests lunch, because SHE PAYS.We decided on Arby's, because that's where I wanted to go. Those commercials for the chicken salad sandwich drive me crazy. I don't think we've been there since last summer. So Mom was all for it. Of course, lunch with Mom is never just lunch. As I turned off T-Hoe in the parking lot, Mom's phone rang.Mom is barely one step ahead of Seinfeld in the dated phone department. She does not have a giant shoe-box size cordless, but she does have a tiny one-piece cellular. It looks like something that came out of a plastic-bubble-filled quarter toy machine at the entrance of a supermarket. It's not even a flip phone. Just a minute lozenge with numbers that virtually need a GameBoy stylus to dial. Progress is not Mom's friend.Anybody care to guess Mom's ring tone? That's right. It's the sound of a harvest-gold, kitchen-wall-mounted, land-line, rotary-dial phone. No need to fix what ain't broke. Besides, a phone is supposed to ring like that. That's how you know it's a phone, not some kind of alarm going off in your purse that you can ignore. As you might have guessed, being pretty smart cookies and shrewd blogreaders...Mom has phone issues.To begin with, that ring must have been set to the same decibels as a jet engine upon takeoff. Mom is not hard of hearing. But we both may be now. It rang and rang and rang while Mom fumbled around in her purse. Seriously. How many places are there to look for a phone in your purse? \"Oh! I'm sure it's your sister. She's going to get onto me for not answering. I put it right here. I can't find it! See? She's letting it ring a long time. She knows I'm looking for it. Now where is that phone?\"I should have just started up T-Hoe again to combat the upper 80s, but I was certain we'd be out of there and into the restaurant within seconds. Not so. Mom eventually snagged that charm-bracelet-sized phone and had a conversation with Sis, then handed the phone to me so Sis could ask why Mom was not home, because she said she'd be home in the afternoon, and it was AFTER NOON and she wasn't there. It was 12:30. I got rid of Sis, then asked Mom how she could lose that phone in her purse EVERY SINGLE TIME she put it RIGHT WHERE SHE KNEW to get it. \"You've had the same purse and the same phone for ten years. How can you not know where you put the phone? She really did not have a satisfactory answer, but since we were both dehydrating and starting to blister like overcooked hot dogs on a charcoal grill, I let it slide.Inside, Mom needed help ordering. Not because she can't read the menu, but because she's indecisive, and likes to make small talk with the workers. As she debated the merits of curly fries or waffle fries, I pushed her to the waffles. \"The curly fries are spicy, Mom.\" That's what Genius says, anyway. Of course the counter girl had to add her two cents. \"I don't think they're spicy.\" Yeah. She doesn't have the palate of a septuagenarian. Then she asked for a name. Mom looked at me. Hey, she was the one paying. I twisted her arm until she identified herself. Okay. I wouldn't do that. Septuagenarians have brittle bones. But I refused to give my name. I'm weird that way.I'll warn you right now that Mom filled her soda cup with Mountain Dew. She's been off soda for about a month, because my sister suggested it. Took away Mom's daily Diet Coke pleasure, though she made her own at home in a Bubba cup rather than scamming free ones at Voice of the Village. Mom even whispered it to me over the table. \"I have Mountain Dew in my cup!\" Yes, she of the blood like pure Rocky Mountain spring water, same as The Pony, who gets all jacked up on that elixir.I offered Mom some onion rings, because they were SO good, and not something she would have at home. She insisted that I try some waffle fries, which made me feel bad because they were TERRIBLE, all mushy and not tasty, and I had recommended them to her. She didn't seem to mind. Just ate my onion rings and informed me that she was used to watching TV while she ate. Huh! That Mountain Dew sure did loosen her tongue.\"Well, now you have me instead of TV, and I only have four channels: Hick, Genius, The Pony, and Big Brother.\" That, or the Mountain Dew, gave her the giggles. She carried on like a giddy school girl all through lunch. She especially liked the Hick channel, with the episode where Hick was a quarter short for the public toilet. As we left, Mom filled her cup with more Mountain Dew. It's a wonder I did not get a call to bail her out of the county jail after we parted ways.Later in the afternoon, I tried to call and check in with her at home. Sis was going out to pick up Chex Mix that she strongarms Mom into making for her. But Mom didn't answer. I was a little concerned that she had not made it home. She was low on gas, you know. So I made a mental note to keep checking. About 45 minutes later, Mom called me back. \"I took that Check Mix over to your sister's house. She said she was busy, and that would be easier for her. I saw on my answering machine that you called.\"\"Yes. I was getting worried. But I sure didn't want to call you on your cell phone.\"\"Oh! I had it on!\" Mom started with the giggles again.\"That's what I was afraid of. I couldn't stand the though of you digging and digging for it, muttering, 'She's going to know I'm looking for it in this purse.'\"We're going to the movies tomorrow. Maybe I'll offer to keep her phone for her."}, {"title": "And Now, a Word From Our Protagonist", "date": "Saturday, June 29, 2013", "text": "Hick strolled out of the bedroom yesterday morning in his tighty-whities, and plopped down on the living room long couch to rub lotion on his feet.

I yanked out a handful of change and finally found a quarter. When I got through the door, that toilet was nasty. I took some toilet paper and cleaned it up. I threw the toilet paper in the toilet and flushed it. Then I turned around and dropped my pants to go to the bathroom. I had just sat down when the door opened. It wouldn't close without another quarter. I didn't have another quarter! I couldn't get up. I hollered for one of the guys on the trip with me. 'Bob! Put in a quarter!' He had one, or I would have been sitting there exposed while I took a dump.\"\"That's a really good story.\"\"Yeah.

No, it's not a bonus Auction Meat attachment. Nor is it a raccoon tail to flap behind the grill as you wheel it from one location to another to avoid sun, wind, and rain.

Tank the beagle has a hole in his left haunch. The Pony saw it when he let the goats out Tuesday morning. \"Hey, Mom! I think Tank got in a fight. He has a bite out of his side.\"Let's not delve into the concept of karma too deeply. Tank is the dog who sank his teeth into our sweet, long-haired, yellow-duct-taped-board-horned Nellie. Sank them right into her side, and held on like a vicious snapping turtle waiting for thunder, while she trotted across the yard trying to escape. All over a piece of bread that he was too lazy to grab before that docile white goat, formerly owned by a little old lady as a backyard pet. He wasn't even attempting to get the bread, just venting his rage on Nellie's hirsute flank. I don't think he broke the skin, just chewed a mouthful of hair for about 50 feet until she jostled him loose.It's our own fault, I suppose, for allowing Tank to maintain possession of his babymakers. He has little dog syndrome, too. But he's pretty much too lazy to go looking for a fight. If it's not a bigger dog eating scraps to be snarled at, or a timid goat, he's all bark. So I was a bit surprised to hear that he had tangled with a critter. He doesn't chase after wayward yard dogs, or the horses across the road floating around under their summer blankets. Only barks, mostly from the safety of the porch. He's too lazy to roam far abroad. He used to run rabbits through the woods down by the creek every morning, but he's slowed down since his adolescent days.I went to look at the wound. It was bigger than a quarter, but smaller than a half-dollar. Round. Right on that muscly side-hip area. It was, perhaps, a half-inch deep. He licked it intermittently. You know dog saliva. It's a miracle salve for what ails you. I told Hick about the crater that evening. And it hit me. \"Do you think somebody shot him?\" It's happened to our neighbor. Not the man. The man's dog.Hick took a look. \"No. It's a bite, not a shot. Something got ahold of him.\"We're keeping an eye on the wound. It doesn't ooze. Looks like it's healing. Tank doesn't limp. We once took a mailbox cat to the vet because it was bitten on the chest, and the bite kept stretching open. A half-dollar size hole showed the transparent connective tissue holding in the muscles.\u00a0 We spent nigh on $100 for an exam and antibiotic ointment, only to have the vet say on the way out, \"Cats get these injuries all the time. It looks terrible, but they heal right up on their own.\"The patient is being monitored.

It's the relieved sigh of the USPS, upon disappearing from Val's radar momentarily. The Pony passed his written driving test and earned his learner's permit today. He did that in a satellite station of the Missouri State Highway Patrol. Which of course employs state workers. Who were actually polite this go-round, not like the battleaxe who banished me to the outer hallway before I even presented the birth certificate and social security number of Genius when he took his written test three years ago.Even though nobody was talking to either of the two counter women, I was told to wait behind a portable sign until they were ready. I was already waiting behind the sign. Because the sign said, \"Wait here until called.\" Not that it talked, of course. That was written on it. In English. Bet they'll get in trouble for that before long, and have to list every conceivable language and dialect to be fair and nonpartisan. I had with me a birth certificate, social security card, and a piece of mail with The Pony's name and address. The three items the official website listed as required to obtain a learner's permit. When the uniformed lady was good and ready, she called me. I handed her the paperwork and told her why we were there.\"I don't need that. Just the birth certificate.\" She popped up from her chair, grabbed a spherical camera off her monitor, held it in The Pony's face, and said, \"I'm going to take your picture. Go to terminal number two and take your test. You can wait in the hall, Ma'am.\"It wasn't long before The Pony came out. \"We need that thing.\"\"What do you mean? Do I need to come in? What thing?\"\"Just come in.\" He meant the birth certificate. The uniformed lady had typed his name wrong. Seriously. How hard is it to copy PONY off a birth certificate? This was a new lady dealing with the error, in the same seat as the old lady. She voided that printout and made a new one.\"You'll need to take this to the license office to get his official permit.\" I expected that. Off we went. With the birth certificate, social security card, and mail showing The Pony's name and address. Just like listed on their official website. The license office was back in Backroads. Right behind the dead-mouse-smelling post office. We were number 45. They were serving 39. We were lucky to get the last two seats. It's a small office. And everyone brings the wife and kids with them.There was no sign of the witchy witch who took my driver's license photo from not-heaven, the one that I will have until 2019. Three workers were working. The first spent twenty minutes with an old lady and man at the entry window. The second was raking in money hand over fist for automobile licenses. The third was busy denying a woman the pleasure of paying money for a license on a trailer because she didn't have a title. That woman called her husband, they could reach no solution, and she left, unsatisfied. Really, DMV? You think people come in to buy a license for a trailer that you wouldn't even know they had, and they're trying to pull something over on you?Finally, our number was called. I gave Wenchy Wench #2 the birth certificate, the social security card, and the One Story magazine that The Pony has a subscription to. The information that was listed as necessary on the official Missouri Department of Revenue website. WW2 shoved back the magazine. \"I can't take that. That's junk mail.\" Yeah. Because 15-year-old kids get utility bills and check stubs and mortgage statements and property tax receipts. And scamming adults just happen to have the kid's birth certificate showing that adult as the parent, trying to scam a $3.50 learner's permit out of the DMV/DOR.\"He's 15. He does not get bills. There is nothing else he receives in the mail.\"\"Well, we can't take junk mail. We can take your information if he lives with you.\" I sent The Pony out to get my other purse. Just in case I had saved the information that it took me three trips to collect when I was unfortunately shot for my own license. Because I never got a notice of renewal for my six-year-old license. Aha! I had the check stub. You remember...because the utility bill wasn't good enough, because it's in Hick's name.\"Here's my check stub.\"\"I can't take that.\"\"You took it when I came for my license four months ago.\"\"It's more than 60 days old. I can't take it.\" Oh, of course not. Because nobody ceases to work for an employer within a 60-day period, I suppose. But after that 60 days, we're all unemployed. Trying to pull the wool over the DMV's eyes, living in a different place. Hopping from house to house, job to job, every two months.\"And you can't take this electric bill because it's in his dad's name, not mine.\"\"That's right. His dad would have to bring him in.\"\"He can't miss work for that. I'll go home and get a newer check stub.\" Remember, none of this junk mail nonsense was listed on their official website. No list of what mail is suitable for a 15-year-old kid. Oh, and their list said they would take a voter registration card. Even though poll workers can't ask for it when you vote. And mine had the year 1991 on it, even though it was mailed last year. So we went back home.

I could not put off my doctor's visit any longer. I had already stalled once, right at the end of the school year. If I was any more off-putting, Doc might become suspicious. Think I was seeing a convenient care nurse practitioner. Not that there's anything wrong with that.This was a regular appointment, nothing special, nothing wrong. I gave my blood to the lab two weeks ago. At that time, they made a big deal of gathering too much information, and encouraged me to divulge my email so I could \"check on lab results online\" and not have to call the office. I never call the office. I wait for a postcard in the mail so my rural mail carrier will know how healthy I am and ascertain whether he can take me in hand-to-hand combat.Of course the temperature outside was in the mid-nineties by the time I pulled onto the blacktop parking lot. I said a nearly tearful goodbye to T-Hoe's arctic AC, and dragged myself across the shimmering expanse to the tall professional building that I hoped was a mirage. Nope. At least I had an elevator to myself, and only had to deal with one surly old man with a cane and jeans rolled up near the knee, him sputtering through his white beard as I dared stand outside the men's room when he wanted to exit. Perhaps that needs some clarification. My medical facility is not filled with mountain men/swamp people/dynasty ducks/wild hoggers, or any other backwoods reality stars. He was the only disgruntled person I encountered. And, I don't stand outside men's rooms. It was in an 'L' where I was trying to enter the women's room, and he yanked his door open and wanted to plow me over, cane and all. I suppose he thinks women should be in the kitchen, stewin' up a possum, not seeking well-patient care in a doctors' building.The first window-woman did not bust my chops today. I went to sign in on the clipboard, after receiving such chastisement two weeks ago for going directly to the window. But no. Today she wanted me to step right up to the window. She asked for not one whit of identification. Neither insurance card, no driver's license, no address or phone number. Just took my name, and told me to go wait somewhere else. Which I did. For 45 minutes. That's a good interval for this office.When the wacky loudmouth nurse called me back, she got into a detailed discussion with a little girl in the waiting room. \"Is that your doll? She's cute. Can you change her clothes and everything? No? Then what fun is she? What? Her eyeballs pop out? Different eyes? Different hair? That's too much! In my day, we just changed their clothes!\" After standing awkwardly in the entryway to the inner sanctum for five minutes listening to doll specs, I was summarily whisked around the corner to the scales. Lucky for me, Wacky Loudmouth Nurse likes to talk about herself. I distracted her with doll talk, and inserted, \"Aw, this weight thing isn't really necessary. It's the same as last time.\" It worked!WLMN quizzed me on my close associates. I'm surprised she didn't want birthdates and social security numbers. She typed that stuff into my file. Verified my meds. Asked me about the book I was reading, just before stuffing a thermometer under my tongue. Which meant that SHE could talk about books she likes to read. Then she pumped up the sphygmomanometer, and asked me to reach my other arm across my ample chestal area, to hold the velcro flap that was ripping loose one synthetic hook-and-eye at a time, as if that would not affect my blood pressure. At the same time, she told me that she had to pay $10 for a library card at the Backroads library. Now THAT'S a blood-pressure raiser. It was only $5 last time I got one. After a tale of her childhood Bookmobile escapades, WLMN left me to stew in my normal temperature and pressure while awaiting the main act.But no. There was another opener vying for my attention. A medical student! Not just any medical student, by cracky! A second-week medical student! I tried to act normal. No need to scare her into another profession. Though I could have come up with some really creative answers to her questions. I am almost as well-versed in ER trivia as I am in The Show About Nothing. To further show that I meant her no harm, I asked her to look into my right ear. As you might guess, she found nothing. In making small talk, I announced that I had been unable to access my lab results through the patient portal, and that I held her fully responsible. I guess she knew that I was joking.Doc came in and sat on the exam table and asked for more info. I told him he was part of the vast conspiracy to harvest my personal information, without even any promised lab results to show for it. He disagreed. Declared that my results had been put in the \"wrong bin\" which made me think of trash. He was in a jovial mood, perhaps to show off for the pretty young med student, in case his two plaques for Medals of Commendation from the U.S. Army, and the certificate of certification in geriatric medicine in 2003 had not worked their magic.Doc declared that my labs were excellent. I wouldn't know, still not having seen them. He wrote an order for my meds. Listened to my heart, perhaps just checking to see if I had one. Told me to breathe, like I needed his permission for that. Then he sat down again, said I looked great, glowing almost, and asked what was going on, anything exciting? I declared that the heat was killing me, meaning it as an explanation for the \"glowing\" part, what with my flushed face, and Doc said, \"Well, I don't know what you expect ME to do about the heat!\" He's a real joker. I should have told him I'd soon be shopping at Aldi's due to cranking my home thermostat lower. \"So what else? I knew it was time for you to come in. It's summer. What are you doing with all your time?\" Obviously, he could see that it was NOT exercising.\"I like to write, and I'm going to be published in a book coming out in September.\"Doc was duly impressed. \"Will I get a free autographed copy? That's big time. Bring me a book.\" Those doctors. Always looking for freebies. Spoiled by the pharmaceutical industry. I explained that it was only in an anthology, and Doc and the medical student still feigned excitement. \"Not just anybody can do that!

That saved me a day and a trip to a neighboring town. So it was with joy that I nodded to him this morning when I encountered him on the way to town, and gave him the two-fingered steering-wheel salute. We are best buds, no?Yeah. NO!Here is what The Pony found in EmBee, our green metal pipe mailbox, today.The cover was clinging by a thread. I don't know what that bar code is, stuck to the top edge in the photo. The inside page was all crumply. I would show you the horrendous condition of the back cover...except there's no back cover. It is completely gone. Probably being made into a voodoo implement with which to torture me in the future.Seriously. This is serious. How am I expected to hone my craft with a professional magazine in this condition? Do you know how hard it's going to be to stack this issue on the end table under my plier lamp so I can read it when I find time?I have not had this much trouble with a magazine since my second year of teaching, in Sheldon, Missouri, where I lived in an upstairs apartment with a threadbare rug in an old railroad hotel, where I slept in a bedroom that was once a back porch, hanging off the building proper at a 15-degree angle. The bedroom, of course. I was not hanging off the building. I could have been dislodged by the atmospheric wake of the train that regularly sped by on the track twenty feet from my dwelling.Yes, that little no-horse miniature-pony town had its own post office. I walked there every morning on my way to work, to pick up mail from my post office box. Times were tough back then, and my mom had given me a People magazine subscription for Christmas. It was my only pleasure, next to the three channels I could receive on my tiny TV with rabbit ears. People arrived every Monday. I carried it to school, and read it on my 1st-hour plan time. What's that? Planning? Surely you jest. I taught elementary PE. I could plan those lessons in my head in a coma. Yes, People arrived every Monday. In the beginning.As time went by, People showed up on Tuesday. And then...and then...People slouched in on Wednesday, rumpled, with cookie crumbs in its crevices!I don't mean to point the finger at our hair-trigger-temper, ten-point-veteran's bonus civil servants...but I suspect that an insider somewhere in my People's chain of command was having his way with my glossy companion.

That sleeping must have been hard work, because later in the afternoon he had to take a two-hour nap. Thank goodness I was able to nag him into revealing his dirty laundry between snoozefests.Normally, I do laundry in the morning. Like between 6:30 a.m. and noon. Especially on days like these when the temperature climbs into the nineties. Had he only cracked open that festering suitcase last night, to release the King-Tut's-tomb-like miasma, I would have been able to tackle Mount Short T-Shirt Sock Brief in the cool hours of dawn. But no.It's not that I am so altruistic that I wish to save the earth from harm, and refuse to add to the drain on power sources during peak hours. It's not even that I am too cheap to launder during peak hours. No. I have my reasons. And they all point to maximum comfort for Val.My laundry room is off the kitchen, on the main floor. A wooden louvered door separates the rooms. The ceiling of the laundry room is lacking insulation. That's because there's a flap of ceiling that houses a pull-down ladder for attic access. You\u00a0 know. In case we need to get up there and set mousetraps so mice don't poop in our bathroom ceiling light/exhaust fan.That little lack of insulation makes my laundry room the 10th Circle of Not-Heaven.I could not begin my ascent of Mount Short T-Shirt Sock Brief until 11:00. No danger of frostbite on this peak. No sherpas, either. I was on the verge of losing consciousness upon disturbing the ragtag pile of supplies that needed transfer from the cloth cairn against the north wall to their cleansing bath on the south wall. Like a factory worker in a horseradish processing plant, I needed a gas mask. It did not help that two damp towels had been entwined in the moldy milieu, marinating, for 24 hours. Or that our power went out at 5:02 last evening, and the temperature rivaled that of an equatorial rain forest.The goal was to complete three-fourths of the journey before a snowstorm blew in to obscure the peak. Or at least before a thunderstorm blew in to cut off the 3:00-a.m.-restored flow of electricity. I must declare the first leg of the climb a success. By 2:30, Mount Short Sock Brief had been conquered, and base camp was established.

Enough to make one rip off her shirt upon entering her 74-degree home, to dissipate heat while putting away purchases while home alone. Enough to make one tarry on the toilet, leaning one's bare back against the cool lid, willing the meager wisps of conditioned air emanating from the floor vent to evaporate the rivulets of sweat earned by carrying in Save A Lot necessities. Enough to make one weigh the benefits of whiling away more minutes so disposed, or expending the effort to descend into one's dark COOL basement lair to read The UK Daily Mail on one's desktop.Not that I would do any of those things, of course. But I DO have an aversion to the heat. I blame my absent thyroid. But it could just as well be my well-insulated epidermis. Folks living the Native life above the Arctic Circle might just as well twist me like a bloated washcloth and squeeze oil from my pores for dipping their meat. Though I would hope they stopped short of flaying me for muktuk.Last night I could not fall asleep. After 90 minutes of tossing and turning, okay, 90 minutes of lazily laying in one position sweating, I got up and cranked down the thermostat to a chilly 73 degrees. You wouldn't believe what a difference a degree makes.Well. I was just about to finish with the sentence: At least I have my power and my air conditioning.

It was only a couple of weeks ago that I ordered a Grilled Chicken Salad, and found, upon unbagging it back at home, that they had given me a CRISPY Chicken Salad. I let it go. Because those kittens really needed their rest.Today I gave those lazy layabout teenage employees of Dairy Queen a second chance. The equivalent of turning the other cheek. But I DID check the salad before I pulled away from the drive-thru. Grilled chicken smiled back at me. All was well. Or so I thought.I am a bit persnickety about my salad. Again, another surprise, huh? I remove that shredded purple lettuce stuff, because my palate does not approve. Then I scatter the cheese, tomatoes, bacon bits, and shredded carrots evenly. It goes without saying that I hack the grilled chicken into smaller pieces. I am symmetric kind of gal. If I see wilted lettuce, I weed it out. And because I have forked a big hunk of lettuce in the past, I kind of sift through the bowl to see if one needs to be downsized.This is what I found in the bottom of my Dairy Queen Grilled Chicken Salad today!This is more than a little too big chunk of lettuce. It is a leviathan. A behemoth. It is a veritable ICEBERG of lettuce! Ninety percent of it is below the surface. That gargantuan gob filled the entire bottom of the bowl. Of course I had to do the undone job of the lettuce-shredder and minimize it. I know Dairy Queen can't be buying their salads pre-made. That would not necessitate a fifteen minute wait at the drive-thru window. It's not like they're grilling the chicken and curing the bacon while I wait. Something has to be taking that long.

Somehow, that gene skipped a generation and mutated. The Pony is the Prince of Damaged Goods.Every week The Pony goes shopping with me. He doesn't have a choice. As I push the cart up and down the Walmart acreage, I send The Pony on missions for forgotten or far-flung items. He is quick and efficient and non-complaining. However...Items chosen by The Pony have serious packaging flaws. I don't know how he does it. One would think that perhaps The Pony picks through the shelves for the least desirable unit, in order to end his weekly sentence in grocery shopping prison. That would be assuming that The Pony puts effort into anything other than computer game play and science fiction writing.I have taken to inspecting objects The Pony brings before allowing him to place them in the cart. I always regret my lack of diligence when it comes time to put away the items at home. The Pony is an equal-food-group slacker. It doesn't even have to be food. Shampoo with a leaky top, Puffs With Aloe sporting a crunched corner, Tide trailing out of the box, National Enquirer with ripped cover or uneven center staples, spaghetti noodles box with an open flap, dented can of Cream of Chicken, flapping label white albacore tuna, bread loaf misshapen with a V in the side, Oreos cracked in half...The Pony has selected them all over perfectly sound specimens. It's like a sixth sense with him.The Pony is a picky eater. He is not one for vegetables other than a baked potato, or carrots in a roast. He will, however, consume fruit such as strawberries, grapes, apples, bananas, and canned pineapple chunks. I sent him to grab a couple of pineapple cans off the shelf. We buy the kind in natural juices, so Hick can also indulge. The cans showed no dents or label rippage, so I put them in the cart. Imagine my surprise two days later when I went to open one and read, Pineapple Chunks in Heavy Syrup. I called The Pony to the kitchen.\"When your dad comes in, make sure you tell him not to eat the pineapple because it will kill him.\" Okay, maybe that was a bit dramatic, but I didn't want The Pony to forget. He hears Hick come in the front door, and I sometimes do not. It's a long way from my dark basement lair.\"I'll tell him.\"\"Why did you get the kind in heavy syrup?\"\"It's all they had.\"\"I don't think so. I'm sure there were other brands. If you had told me, I could have gotten them at Save A Lot. Even though their cans aren't flip-top, and I have to give myself carpal tunnel with the can opener.\"\"I'll eat this kind. Next time we'll get some for Dad.\"Later in the evening, I saw that The Pony had left about half of his chunks in the white coffee cup with a Christmas bear on it that he prefers for eating his pineapple. \"Didn't your want your pineapple?\"\"Not really. It's too sweet.\"Sometimes, I want to pop him on the forehead with the heel of my hand, like that frowny little toddler girl does to her mom in the V8 commercial.When The Pony sees how successful my proposed handbasket factory is, he might want to go into business with his grandma.

She ran into her doctor in Aldi's.Aldi's is Mom's Save A Lot. She lives closer to Aldi's than I do. At least once a week she makes a trip over there to shop for staples, and products they carry, like chicken in a box, that she really likes. There are bargains to be had that let her thumb her nose at Walmart.Let's also establish that Mom's doctor is my doctor. He's a good guy who will bend over backwards to put you at ease, and push tests ahead so you don't spend needless weeks worrying about results. At the same time, he's a realist. He does not sugar-coat possible outcomes. I even caught him with a tear in his eye when he discussed my impending thyroid surgery a couple of years back. He plays poker every week with my mom's Czechoslovakian neighbor. Doc has a big fancy doctor house. Not that I've been there. But at an appointment shortly after one of Backroads's famous ice storms, he talked about his built-in generator that starts when the power goes off. His wife used to work in the office with him as a nurse practitioner, but then decided to stay home and devote more time to the kids. So, in my mind, they're living the idyllic doctor-family lifestyle.Mom said this is not the first time she's seen him in Aldi's recently. Is this what it's come to, people? Doctors have to buy their groceries at Aldi's? Have to count pennies? Have to use their pampered surgeon hands to bag their own store-brand canned peas? Doc is not a house-call, horse-and-carriage, country doctor who takes a basket of eggs in exchange for lancing a boil. He works in one of the two main hospitals in the area, in a doctors' clinic, fourth floor, and has surgical privileges. He's no Dr. Dave Malucci character who earned his medical degree in Grenada. He's a former Army doctor. I've seen his diploma and awards hanging on the exam room walls.Mom says she hates to run into Doc at Aldi's. Not because she's worried that he might catch her putting snack cakes into her cart. But because she hasn't fixed herself up. You know how septuagenarians are about prepping for a doctor's visit. She had not rolled her hair, and was wearing jeans and an old-lady t-shirt. She said Doc was wearing his hat. It's what Genius would call a \"Newsboys\" hat. Mom said, \"I don't know if he's trying not to be recognized, or if he just likes that hat. He always has it on when I see him out. His wife did not look very good. You know, she used to really keep herself up when she worked in his office. I ran into them in the aisle, and he spoke to me, and later they got in line behind me at the checkout, and he said, 'I wonder if we can predict how much we'll spend?' I told him, 'I think I've got less than $20 worth here.' But he never told me his amount.\"Yes, some people might find it disturbing that their doctor shops at Aldi's. Like it's akin to living in a van down by the river. Like doctoring is now a thankless job that does not pay one enough to shop at Walmart like normal people. To me, that's not the most shocking part.What kind of man does the grocery shopping with his wife? That does not happen much here in Backroads. Like skinning and butchering the animals taken in an Inuit hunt, grocery shopping here in Backroads is women's work.Surely Doc could find something better to do on his day off."}, {"title": "I Really Wish He Had Gas", "date": "Tuesday, June 18, 2013", "text": "Hey! Did you know that Lowe's does not carry giant springs? And that they will tell you over the phone, \"Sure, we have one of those. Come on in and we'll show you.\" Hick is so easy to fool. I never trust what a retailer tells me over the phone. Sure they want you to come in. Once you're there, and find out they never heard of a giant spring, you're likely to buy something else so your 20-mile trip was not in vain.Of course, I may be a bigger fool that Hick. Maybe he didn't really rush off to Lowe's after supper last night. Maybe he went to a class in nonstick-skillet-scratching at the technical school.Today, Hick sent me on a mission to procure his giant spring. Here it is, in all its glory, on the floor mat of T-Hoe.Lest you think that doesn't look like such a very big spring, allow me to direct your attention to the severed sections placed end-to-end by the garage door store technician.That rusted-out industrial-strength Slinky is fatter than my forearm, and at least 18 inches long. I'm sure you will be surprised to find out that the garage door business did not have one in stock, either. But I outsmarted them! I didn't bother to call first. Heh, heh. Just walked in with The Pony carrying those two parts of the whole. The workers looked a bit frightened. They might have suspected a pipe bomb. Or some drill cores to be used as noggin-thumpers. As you might imagine, their days are filled with folks wandering in to spend thousands of dollars on fancy garage doors. Not to scavenge Frankenstein appendages for antiquated car-house portals.Hick had assured me that the girl running the place was sharp as a whip. I think he might have mixed a metaphor there. He knows her dad, and said she should know right away what we needed. Well. The only girl I saw was on the phone with a customer. A dude walked out to greet us.My first stab of apprehension came when he asked if our garage door had one spring, or two. What? How am I supposed to know that? I'm inside the vehicle when the door is opening and closing. We carried in two pieces, but it should have been one spring. We have two doors. And this was off one of them. I could not answer his riddle. Dude was a bit flustered. \"I don't have gas! If I don't have one of these, I'll have to get gas. It will take a while. Let me check.\"Dude set about measuring our spring. He took a metal thingy and hooked it in a crack and counted the rings. Then he asked that girl if they had any of the plastic things. She replied that they had ordered boxes full of them. Maybe he should look in the kitchen. Huh. Dude came back with a plastic ruler. He measured again. He went to call somebody and ask if he was measuring correctly. Then he said he would check the storeroom. Then he said he did not have any of these springs. And that he was out of gas! He needed gas! He would not have a spring for us until tomorrow. Could we wait?I'm sure Dude did not mean wait there overnight. They had a little solarium with a child's play table and patio chairs with footstools. But I'm certain he meant could we come back the next day, and would our garage be able to wait for its spring. Like, was there anybody trapped inside that needed to be extracted within the next 24 hours. I asked about what time we could pick up our new spring tomorrow. You know. In the ballpark, not a time such as 9:38 a.m. And do you know what Dude said?\"I'll have to get gas!\"He wanted our phone number. I told him we might not be home. Just give me a general time. Like, perhaps, \"After noon?\" Dude said yes. After noon. I told him we might even call before we left home. You know. In case he had trouble getting gas.I am secretly hoping that \"getting gas\" is a euphemism for consulting somebody with a lot of experience in making garage door springs."}, {"title": "Forks.

The pressure must be released. Each day, Hick finds a way to get under my skin. I'm sure he's taking valuable time away from poking venomous snakes with sticks, taunting bulls with red capes, and lobbing stones at hornets' nests. He would be much safer sticking to those pursuits.Hick arrives home any time within a 90-minute window. It is hard to guess the time to have his supper ready. We rarely sit down to eat, what with Genius being gone most evenings, The Pony ready at a regular dinner time, me not having lunch until 2:00 and not ready for another meal, and Hick popping in at his convenience. Tonight I served Hick some baked fish, a grilled pepper-jack on Nutty Oat bread, some slaw (yes, my mother's favorite side dish), and a bowl of strawberries. Actually, I did not physically serve him. Which was the problem.Hick got home before I had started his meal. In addition, he declared that he would be making a trip to Lowe's as soon as he was finished eating. So I popped the fish in the oven, slathered some I Can't Believe It's Not Butter on the bread, heated up the non-stick skillet, washed and beheaded the strawberries, and set out the slaw and pepper jack. I noticed that my skillet had a few new scratches. I've only had this one since Christmas. Like Lucky Ned Pepper told Rooster Cogburn about Mattie Ross when they left her at the camp with Tom Chaney, \"She was in wonderful health when I last saw her.\" That was the night I cooked up some mushrooms and onions. Now my skillet had more grooves than the rumble strip on an interstate highway shoulder. I called to Hick that his food was ready. Silly me. I should have plated it for him. I usually don't, because he sometimes wanders in to eat after goating and chickening all evening. This time, I was standing right there to see what transpired. Hick ignored the plate I had set out for him. He grabbed a different one. Then he whipped a fork out of the drawer, and before I realized what was happening, he jabbed it under the grilled cheese in the non-stick pan. A FORK! ON MY NON-STICK PAN! Oh, the Teflonity! Not only did he scrape it under the sandwich, but the sandwich started to bow in the middle. Who scoops a grilled cheese out of non-stick pan with a fork? That's some crazy behavior right there! The spatula was conveniently resting on the plate I had set out for him. No wonder he ignored it.Okay, so it's a metal spatula. I know how to use it. I prefer my old blue plastic spatula, but I broke it over Tank the beagle during a 3:00 a.m. bout of barking. I didn't break it over the beagle. That would be not right, and bring PETA down on me. I don't believe in whacking animals unless they first pierce flesh. Hick has whacked our shepherd Ann with a dead chicken, which dissuaded her from killing, though he probably should have done it with the first corpse, not the fourth. I told him that idea of tying a dead chicken around her neck would only make her think, \"Ooh! A chicken necklace! I need another one of these.\"Let's see, where was I...Tank was baying at the neighbor's dog in the early morning hours, and, can you believe it, he would not stop when I told him, \"SHUT UP!\" and poked my finger in his face. Must be because he still has his baby-makers, because I can't imagine any other dog refusing to stop barking when faced with such a logical request. So...I had taken my favorite spatula out there, because I didn't have a rolled-up newspaper, print is dead, haven't you heard? When Tank had the audacity to snarl at me for getting in his face, like I was challenging him by looking straight into his eyes and waggling my finger, can you imagine that, then I slammed that spatula on the porch boards to get his attention and show my displeasure with his behavior. Funny how that didn't really stop his barking, but broke my favorite spatula! You'd think if they could send a man to the moon, they could make a plastic spatula able to withstand contact with Wolmanized lumber.I know I did not scratch my own non-stick skillet with my metal spatula. I have a feeling a man who would scoop a grilled cheese with a fork would also scoop mushrooms-and-onions with a fork. He might as well have asked Freddy Krueger or Edward Scissorhands to grab a fistful and toss them onto his plate. Of course Hick denied any wrongdoing in the case of the gouged non-stick skillet. Short of nailing up a game camera on my kitchen cabinets to catch him in the act, I am powerless to prosecute him for the crime.Writing is the BEST medicine. Forget that laughter crap. I'm feeling much better.

That's what The Pony and I have been going through all month. It has intensified while Genius is away at Missouri Boys State, where he was asked to donate ten days as part of the technology staff.We have always had the phantom footsteps. Ha ha! The people on those ghost-hunting trips who hear footsteps and get all freaked out are just comical. We live with that 12/7/365. That's normal around the house that Hick built.Here's a new one. The Pony says he hears noises from my office. Not the noises I have heard, like an empty soda can falling off the counter. Nor noises I have heard upstairs in the past, like stacks of magazines falling off the back of the couch onto carpet. No, the new manifestation observed by The Pony is the cracking open of a can of soda. That's how he describes it. It's only when he's downstairs alone, and I am upstairs. We both know there's no soda-openin' going on in my office. That space is reserved for my 44 oz. Diet Coke.A few nights ago, The Pony went upstairs for his shower, then bed. No sooner had he gone up, after five minutes of solitude in my recliner in front of the big-screen TV, than I heard the distinctive sound of a soda opening in my office. It has happened once more since then. Or maybe it's a beer. But it's the sound of a can top flipping open.The Pony also has another new sound. A light switch. I asked him, \"What do you mean, a light switch?\"\"Duh! A LIGHT SWITCH! Like this!\" He trotted across the tile floor to the light switch between the end of the piano we inherited from my grandma and the door to Hick's workshop. He flipped that switch on, then off. It didn't click. They're the silent kind. It thumped. I've never heard that one myself. But The Pony says it happens a couple of times a night, while I'm in my office. In addition, he says he sees a white figure in the doorway of my dark office that he pretends is me. That's the right direction for where I hear my falling can noises.The Pony has been closing his bedroom door at night. I attributed it to him growing up and wanting more privacy, or not wanting to hear Genius's TV or music late into the night. Genius is a night owl like me, while The Pony generally retires before 10:00. Even though Genius keeps his door closed since being chastised for opening his windows while the air conditioning runs, the sound comes through.Last week, I woke up in my recliner around 3:00 a.m. I went upstairs, turned off the basement lights, and went to the front living room window to turn off my laptop that powers my internet. The only lights we leave on at night are the ones under the kitchen cabinets. They provide a dim, twilight kind of ambiance that keeps you from whacking your shin on the coffee table. As I turned to go back through the living room, I saw a white shape outside The Pony's bedroom door. It appeared to be standing. It was like an upright manatee. Kind of a long blob. When I looked directly at it, it was gone. I did not tell The Pony.One day later, that boy was full of questions on the way to town. \"Hey, Mom. What kind of things have you seen besides that headless man? And the sounds. What all have we heard? Didn't you hear magazines falling? Have you ever SEEN anything upstairs?\"I told him about the white blob. He rides behind me in T-Hoe. Weird, I know. But that's what he likes. So I couldn't see him nod at the revelation. But I felt it. \"That's why I close my door at night. I kept seeing something out there. Was it looking in, or looking out? Because I feel like it's watching me.\"\"It seemed to be standing. Not looking in OR out. Standing guard, maybe. Like it was looking toward me in the living room. Only there were no eyes. It was just a perception on my part.\"\"Okay, then. It must be Grandpa looking out for me.\"I haven't seen it again. But you'd think there was a rave going on in Genius's room right above our TV-watching area in the basement. He's been gone since Wednesday morning, and by 4:00 or 5:00 in the evening, we start hearing people walking in his room. It's more frequent after 10:30.I don't know what's going on.

An energetic, adolescent, venom-stuffed stinger-wielder that is buzzing to get out.There I was, minding my own business, my Ps and Qs, my manners, adorned by my lovely, lace-trimmed, pastel-hued, ultra-feminine bonnet, waiting for my turn at the pharmacy. You might recall how my pharmacy recently changed hands. How it went from not quite a mom & pop establishment, perhaps more of an extended family business, to one of ten bazillion links in the largest pharmacy chain ever to dole out drugs to the masses. I'll call it Medi-Wait Pharmacy.The poor put-upon workers were allowed to keep their jobs, but required to toil for the overlord and toe the line to the nth degree. They had to reorganize the front of the shop, placing aisles as close together as a the walkway between the seats of a school bus. Aisles that separate customers as they enter, like pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters in a coin-sorter, to funnel them to the counter like cattle on the way to slaughter. The PICK UP sign hangs over the left side of the counter, and the DROP OFF sign hangs over the right. In between signs are a couple of registers used for additional pickups.The PICK UP clerks were all taken. Two had customers with lengthy explanations and snafus. The third was picking up medicine as fast as it was plopped on the inner-sanctum counter by the pharmacists, and calling for customers who had been waiting in-store for their meds. I was at the front end of the aisle, next in line.I browsed for last-minute purchases as they intended. On my left was a bevy of beauty products labeled as airline size. Not for me. I am flying nowhere, except possibly into a rage in the near future, though currently unbeknownst to myself. On my right, various toothpicks, flosses, and dental probes. No thank you. Not an impulse purchase item for moi.A man came in and stood behind me. I was the line, you see. The line waiting to pick up medicine. A couple of women came in, saw the situation, and declared, \"Uh, yeah. That's not happening.\" They whooshed right back out the self-opening sliding doors. The man remained, second in line, kept in place by my buttocks, which closed off the aisle like a cork in a champagne bottle. Thank goodness that heavy-sighing, toe-tapping, dagger-staring dude did not have a saber on his sash. Probably because he was bereft of a sash. And only because it was being dry-cleaned.I waited, if not patiently, at least captively. There was nowhere else to go. I listened to one guy trying to pick up meds who wanted to have the $60 mouthwash taken out of his order, because the woman he was picking it up for has mouth sores. Believe me, that's not a picture I wanted in my head. I was not trying to eavesdrop. It's a tiny store. The other man being serviced was hacking and coughing about it being a new prescription, and he could leave and get it later if need be, as long as it would be good around the 25th, when he usually came in to get his other refills. The utility clerk had pawned drugs off on two store-waiters, and turned to see if any other bags had been placed for disbursement by the pharmacists. Seeing none, she turned to call the next customer. Who we all know was Val Thevictorian. Next in line.That guy behind me turned tail and ran back up the aisle, dashed around the end cap by the door, and scurried up the next cattle chute to arrive in front of the utility clerk's register. Hacker had just turned to leave. His clerk saw my mouth drop open. She turned to look at Rude Dude and rolled her eyes. \"Did you see that?\" Of course I did. Even Utility Clerk was nodding her head at me and about to put Rude Dude in his place. However, the EyeRoller motioned me to her prime counter real estate. \"I'll help you. That right there is something that almost started a fight in here yesterday.\"Yeah. I was about to unbonnet my bee.Rude Dude was obviously a long-time sufferer of Little Man Syndrome. He was an indignant, snappish, entitled-acting fellow. The type who views the world as his public servant. He must have been somewhere in the middle of his 30th decade of life.

Mother Nature will claw your eyes out if you're not ever-vigilant.The Pony has the duty of checking on the animals during the day. We have a black hen that hatched one chick. Nothing went wrong. She was only sitting on one egg. It was not even her egg. Hens are like that. They're opportunists when they get all broody. I asked The Pony if he was sure it was not her egg. \"Well, considering that she sat on the same spot for two weeks, and there was never an egg under her, I'd say she took this one from another hen.\"Here they are in their little apartment, where they sleep. Even the baby looks wary of the momma's talons.This poor hen is like Miss Prissy. Not in looks. In yearning. She had one other chick last summer, but it disappeared. It was not the one who perched on the edge of the water tub and drowned. This one vanished. Since we don't have chicken wire (what do you think we are, farmers or something?), the chicks weave in and out of the dog pen fence that makes up their open-doored pen. I'm sure something ate it.This is the patio, outside the boudoir, where the little couple can get some sun, see and hear the other fowl all around them, and feel safe from predators or caregivers. Those feet were made for gougin'.Now Miss Prissy is all overprotective of this one chick. Hick put them up in a little pen that used to be a rabbit hutch, until the chick is big enough to have the common sense to not wander off from its mother. They have to have fresh food and water each day. Hick cautioned The Pony, \"Be careful when you reach into that hen's cage. She'll get you. I had to knock her back three times before I could give her food.\"The Pony agreed. \"I KNOW! I have to hold her back with a stick so I can get the water. She'll peck you!\" He must have thought it was a form of torture when I sent him to take a picture while checking on their water at noon.

That gene skipped right over me. I think I got the smartA$$ gene instead. That's what Hick thinks, anyway. Not so much the lack of people-watch-itude, but the bonus of the other. My mom LOVES to people-watch. Ever since I was a kid, she has declared her love of this pastime. I think she used to park on Main Street when I was a kid, just to watch the world go by. It was either that, or watch the Not-Heaven's Angels when they parked their hogs outside the laundromat and took off their clothes to wash them. They were not a leather crowd.Today I went to give some blood at the doctor's office lab. I could have recorded this visit and made a good bit of 44 oz. Diet Coke money selling the DVD. Here. I'll let you live vicariously through me. Because that's the kind of gal I am.My doctor dwells on the fourth floor of a doctor's building that is attached to a hospital. Parking is sometimes in short supply, but I got a decent spot at 8:15 a.m. Coming from the other side of the circular drive was a chubby little boy and his obviously-genetically-related mother. They were a bit ahead of me, and went in first. I was kind of lollygagging, having not been there since last November, looking around at how they'd finished off their new ER wing, and pondering the big Blood Drive Today sign over the main entrance. I was hoping my blood would reach its intended destination.There are two elevators. Without thinking, I knew Li'l Chubby and his not-so-li'l mom got on the left one. Imagine my surprise when I heard, \"Here you go!\" Li'l Chubby was holding that door open with his pudgy doughboy arm. He was the cutest thing, about five years old, with a bit of light-brown stubble on his buzzcut head. What a chivalrous little guy! I wondered if he knew that dude who let me go ahead of him in the gas station chicken line.I stepped in and announced, \"Thank you. I'm going to the fourth floor.\" Li'l Chubby controlled the panel.\"Oh, so are we,\" said his mother. Li'l Chubby did a little kid tap dance, without sound, in sandals. He must have been headed for a checkup, not a sick call. The doors opened and we walked toward the reception desk. \"Oops! We're on the wrong floor.\" I think she saw a sign that had been set up about Suite D and Suite E. Whatever that was. \"Come on. We can take the stairs down one floor. Do you want to take the stairs?\" Li'l Chubby was all for it. No sooner had they passed through the stairwell door than an announcement came out of the ceiling:\"All doors will now close without warning. Repeating, doors will close for a test of the fire system.\"Poor Li'l Chubby! I was worried that they would get trapped in the stairwell. Very few people use those stairs. The doors are always closed, though they're marked for use in case of fire. A smocked lady came up to the door by the reception office, and had to punch in a number code to get it open. Funny how they were testing the fire system, but let the elevators keep running.So many people to watch, so lengthy a blog post! I'll expose more medical building denizens tomorrow...but in case you're wondering, I never saw Li'l Chubby again! I'm sure he was fine.

Because The Unexplained so often intrudes on Val's everyday life.Today we tackle the Mystery of the Big Honkin' Truck. Thankfully, it did not ram into the front of my home and obliterate my internet connection. No, we're talking about a literal Big Honkin' Truck.The Pony and I were on our way to town. The reason does not matter, though it might rhyme with poorty-poor pounce buy-it broke. Just at the city limits, a large semi truck crested the hill. That does not mean it was half a truck. As my mom would say, \"It was a tractor trailer truck.\" The driver honked his semi truck horn. Those things ain't dainty. No new-born kitten mewling there. More like a gosh-darn foghorn. I was a bit surprised. I was on my side of the road. Completely. The lines were just painted last week. It's easy to stay on your half. Trucker was on his half, too. It was not a matter of him being behind the wheel of an out-of-control eleventy-ton rolling missile. I looked in my side mirror after he passed. His brake lights were on. So much for the no brakes scenario.My thoughts jumped to other reasons a driver might honk. There was no livestock on the roadway. Not even a dead armadillo. The latest one is in the middle of town now, across from the funeral home, just before you get to the license office where they made me look like a roasted-pumpkin-headed Sta Puft Marshmallow woman, which is just before the curve that takes you to the dead-mouse-smelling post office.I did not see Trucker waving. Not that I have close trucker friends who regularly drive the blacktop county roads of Missouri. Don't go jumping to conclusions. He was not a personal friend, nor business associate. I did not have a sign on T-Hoe prompting, \"Honk if you love Diet Coke.\" Perhaps there was a police cruiser speed-trapping just over the crest of that hill, mere feet inside the city limits. I made sure to drop from 45 to 30 as I passed the sign. No police.\"Maybe we have a cat on top of our car!\" Several times I've made it to the end of our driveway, only to have our orange tabby scamper down the windshield, over the hood and off the bumper into the grass. The Pony's answer was to pound the car ceiling with both palms. While I was rolling at 30 mph.\"No. No cats.\"There were no wrecks. No pulled-over scofflaws receiving their just dessert tickets. The traffic signals were working. No overturned hogs or dishwashing liquid or beer flowing down the thoroughfare. No cars or humans dangling from the overpass. No UFOs hovering over the metropolis. I was at a loss.After accomplishing our town mission, The Pony and I headed for home. We came up that blind hill at the edge of the city limits, just like Trucker. AND I KNEW THE REASON FOR THE HONKIN' OF THE BIG TRUCK.You can't see over the hill crest. It's kind of like you're launching yourself into space. As soon as you go over the roller-coaster summit of no return, a street branches off both sides of the road. Trucker was honkin' to warn any pulling-out vehicles that he was about to pulverize them. Though how it would have helped them I don't know. Unless they were still contemplating pulling out onto the main road.I'm a freakin' genius when big honkin' trucks are the mystery."}, {"title": "Chivalry Lives!", "date": "Sunday, June 9, 2013", "text": "Are you sitting down?

I know better that to try to score some tasty gas-station chicken on a Sunday at noon. I had only dashed in for my 44 oz. Diet Coke. The chicken line meandered back toward the soda fountain. Thank goodness they were only blocking the Pepsi machine. I fountained out my 44 ounces, and had to turn and go up the candy aisle to get back to the front.I hate it when people do that. They get all out of order for paying. That's as bad as when people come in the door and think they can butt in to pay for their gas. I knew my place. Two ladies had to finish, and an older dude was after them. He just happened to be in the actual line, while I was all cattywompus due to the chicken waiters. I turned my body toward him. Not in some inappropriate come-hither presentation, but to show that I did not expect to pay next. That I was waiting to step up after he did. Animals have not cornered the market on body language.Older Dude grimaced at me when it was his turn. I did not step up. \"Go ahead, I'm after you.\"\"Is that all you got?\" Spoken with a gruffness befitting his shaved bald head with a twelve-o'clock shadow. He eyed my magnificent Diet Coke specimen with suspicion. To see if I had any lottery tickets lurking behind the foam blue-and-white cup.\"This is it.\"\"Go ahead.\"\"Thank you.

Hick sat through various indoctrination meetings with the other parents while Genius took math placement tests. He qualified to go right into Calculus II, but chose to take Calculus I to make sure he had a good foundation. Then there's that 19 hours to consider, also.Hick said that campus police informed the parents that the most stolen items on campus are books. Are you kidding me? BOOKS? When I was in college, the most stolen items were bicycles (if you only ran your locking cable through the front tire), cold Godfather's pizza from the dorm mini-fridge, and clandestine stashes of alcohol. Because really, who's going to the RA or campus police to complain that your illegal beverage was spirited away? So...I suppose this bodes well for the nerd college, that sticky fingers snatch books.Genius headed off to his girlfriend's house to meet up and attend a graduation party.

I did not sense anything amiss. After all, his very own mother mistook a sewer vent pipe for a Grecian urn/Ming vase. And a spot of bird doodoo on the windshield for an insect hitching a 30-mile ride. Nothing to see here. With much squinting on both our parts, we deduced that we were looking at a building advertising the Baptist Association. Whew!The Pony has new glasses on order. We can't just put new lenses in his old frames, because, well, he sees the rapist association WITH his glasses. Amazing how the new glasses will arrive in 7-10 days. The precise amount of time it takes a personal check to clear. Funny, that.I took The Pony on a wild goose chase to get some fish for lunch. He was wearing those wrap-around black glasses to protect the enormous windows to his soul. I had offered to lead him to water and try to make him drink--no, I had offered to lead him to T-Hoe so he didn't have to risk burning out his retinas in direct sunlight. He declined, preferring the Frankenstein walk to use his arms, both with previously broken elbows, as buffers. We drove along the outer road in a populated area. The Pony squealed, \"Look! Deer!\" Of course I thought he must be seeing lawn ornaments. Imagine my surprise when I glanced out my side window and saw a white flagging tail bounding across a lawn. Town deer! Who woulda thunk The Pony would notice? The more time wore on, the more it seemed that the dilation actually sharpened his vision.We had some errands to run before and after the appointment, one of them being to drop a package from Genius into a UPS drop-off box. He told us exactly where to find it. I pulled in beside it, and wondered when UPS had changed their Big Brown colors to purple, orange, and white. Um...that would be NEVER. Because the box Genius had steered us to was a FedEx box. Not recommended for filling with a package bearing a UPS shipping label.The Pony searched for another location, using my phone. We looked. Craned our necks. Didn't see the other UPS boxes. The Pony swore that there was one in downtown Backroads, on the parking lot of the old license office location, which we passed every morning and evening. Huh. I didn't remember seeing it. So I figured The Pony might be confused. We called my mom to ask about the streets. She hung up and got out her phone book, then called us back. We still didn't see them, until she found out that the social security office was directly next door to the UPS box. Then I spotted it. Brown, no less. Even with his dilated eyes, The Pony jumped out and read that it was, indeed, active, with pick-up at 3:00 p.m.On the way home, through Backroads downtown to get my 44 oz.

I walked out of the house and into the garage and started up the driveway without my refill cup! Lucky for my that I am a virtual Boy Scout when it comes to preparedness. I had an extra cup stashed between the back seats. Can't be paying full price for a new styrofoam cup. Not with the price of gas used to get me to and from town.2-The Road Stripers. Seriously. When is the last time I encountered MoDOT road crews laying down the center yellow stripes on my blacktop county roads? Let me see...I think it was...no...that would be...NEVER! So there's a lead truck with a sign commanding me to keep right, which is kind of hard when there is no shoulder, and the striper metal pole spraying thingy comes way over into my lane. So I had to hang half a tire off the edge and come to a stop until the sprayer and its two school-bus yellow dump trucks that followed it like security guards passed by.3-The Duped and the Darter. People not from here can't figure out the traffic lanes in town. That's because they were designed by some young whippersnapper who had always been awarded awards for showing up more than fifty percent of the time, and breathing in and out on his own. The Duped chugged through the just-turned-green light at the speed of an arthritic tortoise with commitment issues. The Duped finally pulled into the left turn lane at the next light. Instead of surging ahead in my rightful space, I had to slam on the brakes to avoid crashing into The Darter, who came off the exit ramp to my right, shot across two lanes into mine, then slammed on his brakes. In the middle of the road. I don't blame the bad drivers. I blame the intersection designer. We survived for years with only one four-way stop. Now the three lights and disappearing lanes are a bit much. I hate progress. And you kids get off my lawn! (Did you see me brandishing my cane?)4. The Scoff-Parker. At the gas station chicken/44 oz. Diet Coke store, a nincompoop was parked in a non-parking spot. Six pull-in spaces, clearly marked, and this doofus pulled in by the front of the building and blocked gas pumps and the main path to the door. It took me an extra fifteen seconds to walk around that nincompoopmobile.5. The Neverending Dairy Queen Line. The boys wanted me to bring home lunch. I was 8th in line at the DQ drive-thru. AND the old lady in front of me kept backing up. What's up with that? We were on level ground. Yet she slowly came back and back and back. I was afraid I would have to honk at her. She was not very attentive. If I didn't know better, I would say she was leaned over texting, backing without a clue. Or maybe she was just lifting a cheek to fart.6. The Funeral Procession That Blocked the Stoplight. Yeah. Must have been a local celebrity. I've never seen such a line of cars. The police car sat right in the middle of the intersection, stopping traffic in all four directions. I wasn't even out on the road yet from DQ. Traffic was that backed up.At least there was nothing wrong with my precious elixir. Just the extra time needed to procure it and haul it safely home.

In my mind, anyway.The Pony and I rounded our last curve on Daffodil Lane, our blacktop county road. We crested the hill just before our turnoff, and almost plowed into a stopped SUV. It was right where my sweet dog Juno had disappeared last week. There is no reason to stop in the middle of the road. The car crept forward. Stopped. Proceeded down the hill. Kind of indecisive-like, with the driver looking at me in his side mirror. I presumed he was thinking of stealing some mail from the house with a little half-circle drive that keeps its mailbox several feet off the blacktop. \"You watch,\" I told The Pony. \"That car is going to stop at our mailboxes.\"It did! At the bottom of the hill, that SUV pulled in front of our mailbox row and stopped. We stopped behind it. Because we were actually going to pick up the mail from our very own mailbox, which gets delivered within an hour of when we arrived. \"Do you want to get out now and walk up? Or wait until that car moves?\" The Pony preferred to wait. That SUV sat there. The driver stared at me in the mirror. He whipped his ride sharp left, into our gravel road, and maneuvered it so he was going back up the blacktop hill. Yet still sideways on our gravel entrance. The Pony got out and pranced up to our mailbox.SUV Driver called to him. \"Does this gravel road go to 8906 Daffodil Lane?\"The Pony looked at him like he was crazy. \"Um. I don't think so. The blacktop road is Daffodil Lane.\"SUV Driver waved a white envelope through the window. \"Do you know where 8906 Daffodil Lane is? I'm looking for it.\"The Pony shook his head. \"That's not Daffodil Lane. This is.\" He hoofed it back to T-Hoe and jumped in. SUV Driver started back from whence he had come. At least until we were out of sight. For all I know, he parked a few feet up the road and came back to raid fifteen mailboxes. I'm suspicious that way. Especially since our dear metal mailbox, EmBee, was raided for those two mail-order tubes of Clearasil a few months ago. And since we've had mail stolen two other times, though all we lost were bills and my back-to-school letter. There was even an article in the paper about a roving band of mailbox thieves in our area who had been grabbing outgoing mail, marking utility company names off the checks, writing in their own names, and getting them cashed! Which is just a whole lotta wrong going on right there.Val trusts no one. The world conspires against her.But seriously. What kind of person drives around with an envelope, looking for a mailbox to put it in? A person up to no good, I say. If you're going all the way to the mailbox, then go right to the door and tell the people what your letter says. If you got their mail by mistake, drop it in the mailbox at the dead-mouse-smelling post office. No need to waste gas driving the rural roads you are not familiar with. I would have given him the benefit of the doubt and suspected a process server, but a process server is not going to hang around a row of mailboxes with no house in sight.The rottenness in Backroads is expanding exponentially."}, {"title": "It's On a Need-to-Know Basis, and He Doesn't Need to Know", "date": "Tuesday, June 4, 2013", "text": "Conspiracy alert!

Or perverts.Backroads got a brand spankin' new Domino's last year. They do not deliver way out here in the hinterlands where our rural palace is located. We have never once asked for delivery. Any time we call, it is from my cell phone. It's the same number all the time. I know they see it. They repeat my name about fifty percent of the time, even though I've only given them my number. No big deal. You might recall that this is the place where the dude asked me, after taking my order for a half cheese, half sausage-and-mushroom pizza, \"So...you don't want cheese on the other half?\" Yeah. And it's also the place with the front wall made of glass, where we pulled up and observed one of the workers riding a big push broom like a stick horse. Strangely enough, none of us have been sickened by their product. So we continue to patronize their establishment.The last time I called, I got the half-cheese weirdo. His voice is distinctive. Kind of pervy. Kind of breathless. Kind of like that breather/inappropriate-question obscene caller I gained one time after buying a table and chairs at a second-hand furniture store. There was apparently more than one kind of second-handing going on at the place, if you know what I mean. Anyway, the Pizza Perv sounded kind of spaced out. I was sure he would ask me to hold, but he didn't. He kept talking slowly, and took my order. He asked if it was delivery or carry out. Carry out. He asked my phone number. BR 549. Yeah, that's not really my number. I got it from Junior Samples on Hee Haw. Then Pizza Perv asked my address. I was so throw off guard that I almost gave it to him.\"Address? You don't need my address.\"\"Oh. Uh. The manager...wants us to--\"\"I am not giving you my address. Why would you want that?\"\"Um. Uh. For coupons, I think. Yeah. For coupons.\"\"I already get coupons in the mail. I live in Backroads. That's as much as you're getting.\"\"All right. That will be $8.63. It will be ready in 15 or 20 minutes.\"\"OK.\"Seriously! Why would they need my address? Either he was too stupid to remember that it was carry out, which I am sure showed on his little monitor like every other single transaction we ever had with them, or he was up to something fishy. No way am I rolling out the red carpet for daytime burglars.Doesn't the government have a big enough file of information on Val, without Domino's trying to horn in on their act?"}, {"title": "Outsmarted By an Outsmarter", "date": "Monday, June 3, 2013", "text": "I SO hate to be bested in a battle of wits by whippersnapper minimum wage workers who toil only to keep themselves in tattoos, cell phones, thongs, and makeup. I'm a curmudgeon like that.The Pony wanted to go to the movies today, to see After Earth. The commercials looked interesting enough. I invited my mom, and off we went to the 1:45 showing. It's cheaper, you know. The first show of the day. Four dollars a ticket. Props to the kid selling them, who told me I didn't have to renew my AMC movie card just yet, even though they email me every week doomcrying that it's about to expire. We saved $30 dollars with it over the year, so I guess it's worth the $12 price.We got there at 1:15 because we're early birds who like to claim our special seats at the back of the theater. Lucky for us, only a grandpa and a little boy were already inside. They were on the opposite side of the theater, about halfway down. No threat to us. My mom is kind of feisty sometimes. She said, \"I'm going to sit in these two seats behind our row, so nobody will use them.\" A $9.00 daughter does not correct her mother.The Pony wanted to get his popcorn right away. He usually has it eaten before the movie starts. However...I told him no. That at the fortune I would be paying, I was NOT buying stale popcorn. There was only one other movie showing so early, which had started at 1:15. When we entered the building, there was no fresh popcorn smell. That means they were using leftovers from last night. Don't act like they wouldn't do such a thing. You know they do.The Pony had brought in a book to read by the dim light of the wall sconces. Mom and I chatted while listening to the First Look and other pre-movie propaganda. You notice I don't say watched. We only had sound. They do this all the time at this four-plex. I expect more from my minimum wage projectionists. We let it go. We've done that before, and the actual movie started with no picture. I think it was some Robin Hood thingy a couple years ago. Anyway, we listened, and watched people. I was determined not to buy the popcorn until we smelled something fresh.The grandpa grew irritated with the sound only. He took his grandson and stomped out to give them what for. Mom said, \"I should run over there and take their seats.\" She's a real imp. I reared my $9.00 daughter head and forbade that behavior. Four rowdies barged in. They glared at us, then stalked down to the very middle and scooted across mid-row. But not before the last one kicked the opposite door closed, and yanked the one on our side, too. What's up with that? They pay ushers to do that crap. These weren't teenagers, but a woman, man, and two kids. Surprise, surprise. I looked down to see the lady with her phone out texting madly, and the dude and one kid with their feet up on the chairs in front of them. The lack of a picture did not seem to matter.With the doors closed, I could not smell popcorn. I got up to open ours. I stood behind my seat to talk some more with Mom. A worker came in to look at the dark screen. Because obviously, an old grandpa complaining that there was no picture was just trying to prank her. The Pony kept sighing. I went out to check on the popcorn freshness. No way. There was a line, and that girl had STILL not started popping, even though she was down to the bottom of the glass popper cabinet, metal showing. I returned to report. We waited some more. Mom went to check. \"There's a big line now, but she is just scooping along those crumbs.\" When previews started at five minutes before movie time, Mom and I went out for snacks. Heh, heh. No line. The popper was just spitting out the first fresh kernels.A man and boy were buying tickets, so I cut through the candy display to beat them to the counter. After all, FRESH popcorn was raining down into the bottom of the glass popcorn shower thingy. Then Mom had to jinx, it. \"I hope she doesn't scoop that stale stuff out of the corners.\" A less-valuable daughter might have told her mother to bite her tongue. I did not. I flashed my AMC Stubs movie card to show that I was a high roller. I ordered the sodas. Then the popcorn.That crazy counter girl went and stirred the kernels all together! Fresh and not. Middle and corners. I refused to let her have the upper hand. I vowed that no matter whether we wanted them or not, I was going to demand refills as we left.I will bide more time when we return.As for After Earth...meh. Not a masterpiece. Kind of wooden dialogue. Will Smith got paid for sitting on his butt the entire movie. The sciency part was not plausible. Even The Pony mouthed asides all the way through. \"Really? They never visited Earth because it's too dangerous with all animals programmed to kill humans, yet they have the exact antivenom in the first aid kit for the one thing that poisons him?\"They lost me at the slug that STUNG young Jaden.Science teachers do not suffer bad science fiction gladly."}, {"title": "My Stock Has Risen", "date": "Sunday, June 2, 2013", "text": "Everything's coming up roses here in Backroads. Not just my actual roses, the un-goat-eaten bush given to me by Hick several Mother's Days ago, perhaps the one after the three-dollar pink change purse debacle. I know I'm not this mother. But he is, after all, a father, the one who holds the three-dollar pink change purse strings for the offspring who would wish, with much prodding, to buy me a gift.Yes, the rose bush is in full bloom, there's another announcement on the horizon, and I am now the $9.00 daughter! You heard me! I have risen from the ranks of $8.00 daughterdom to the lofty heights above. In fact, I don't mean to jinx myself, but I was almost the $10.00 daughter! Karma and Even Steven must have a bone to pick with me.Here's how it went down. Friday was my mother's birthday. The Pony and I picked her up on the Walmart parking lot for a bill-paying excursion to a nearby town. What? You didn't think we'd go all the way to her house to pick her up, did you? Perhaps when I'm a $50.00 daughter. We had a red shiny gift bag chock full of birthday cards, two cans of beer nuts, a box of Crunch 'N' Munch, two bags of sweet-and-salty snack mix, two very ripe bananas, a week-old National Enquirer, a Globe, and a sparkly silver box with a grabber-machine necklace. Only the best for my mom!Mom had stopped by my sister's house to inspect the grounds, and had driven through her bank to cash her check. I am not privy to which check, anything from retirement, my dad's retirement, a dividend, or some other old-people first-of-the-month check. All I know is that mom knows to the penny where her finances are socked away. So I doubt this was a very big check if she cashed the whole thing. She climbed into T-Hoe, oohed over her gift bag, which she preferred to dig into in private, and proceeded to profess that the bank had shorted her ten dollars.It seems that mom decided that she was going to take the odd amount out of the bank envelope and put it in her billfold to spend all willy-nilly, throwing caution to the wind, it being payday, by cracky! The odd amount came to thirteen dollars and some change. While waiting for us on the parking lot, she opened the envelope. The change was there. The three ones were there. But the envelope contained nary a ten-dollar bill. Mom counted. She did not have an extra twenty. There was the round amount, three ones, and change. She called the bank. \"I have been banking with you since 1972. We never had a single problem. I don't even count the money in the envelope before I drive away. But I just counted it, and I am ten dollars short. I counted several times. I could be wrong. I didn't look at the amount on the check, I just assumed it was the same as always. But there was no ten in my envelope, and I should have had thirteen dollars. No. I can't come in right now. I have other plans. Please check on it and leave me a message at home. I'm sorry if I misunderstood the check amount.\"I felt bad for mom. To her, the principle of that ten dollars was a major fly in the ointment of her day. We continued to the bill-paying town. It has all manner of restaurants not found in Backroads proper. The Pony wanted the exotic Papa John's pizza to bring home for his lunch. Or to eat in the car, as he is wont to do. Genius had ordered us to pick up some Captain D's for his lunch. Mom wanted some Captain D's breadsticks. Hick had not responded to our text offering this cuisine to replace his anticipated bowling alley food. It was in line at Captain D's that Mom dug through her purse and pushed nine ones at me.\"Here. Let me help you pay for lunch.\"\"Mom, it's your birthday. I don't need your money. Hick got paid today. We're fine.\"\"No. Let me pay. I know it won't pay for everything. But it's for my breadsticks, and part for Genius's fish, and part for The Pony's pizza. This is all I have besides twenties. I was going to give you that ten. But the bank didn't give it to me.\"\"Really. You don't have to do that.\"\"I know it! I want to. Now take this.\"\"All right, Mom. Thank you.\" Who am I to deny my mother a wish on her birthday? That's what makes me the $9.00 daughter.We dropped Mom off at her car later, and she headed to McDonald's for a Grilled Onion Cheddar Burger. Mom does not live by breadsticks alone. I told her we could all have dined on prime rib in a fancy-schmancy high-end eatery for the amount we spent on fast food that day. As we passed her bank on the way home, I told The Pony to call Genius for me. He was at Mom's house soaking up her high-speed internet. \"Hey, did the bank call Grandma?\"\"Not while I've been here. There's a message on her machine.\"\"Check it.\"\"The bank has her ten dollars. She can come get it, or they will deposit it in her account.\"\"Okay. I've gotta call her before she passes the bank.\" I called Mom, in line at McDonald's. \"You can stop in to pick up your ten dollars, or they can put it in your account.\"\"Oh, I'll call them to put it in my account. I don't want to go in there. I'd be so embarrassed! Things like this really bother me.\"\"WHY? THEY made the mistake! They shorted you ten dollars!\"\"Oh, I'm sure it was an accident. She was a young girl. Maybe she didn't know what she was doing.\"\"Okay. Just wanted you to know they had called, in case you wanted to stop in.\"Keeping Mom abreast of her finances.

If not for the serious addiction to 44 oz. Diet Cokes, I might never leave the old homestead during summer vacation. I could happily putter around doing laundry, making sandwiches, cleaning, reading, writing, playing with the dogs, and sleeping. OK. Let's strike \"happily\" from that sentence. And we probably should leave out \"doing laundry,\" \"making sandwiches,\" and \"cleaning\" as well. But I could read, write, play, and sleep with no problems.Hick says I'm an old fuddy duddy who doesn't want to do anything. This is one area where he's right. I have never been the life of the party. Well, there were a couple of years in college...but basically, I've always been a homebody. The quiet type. You won't catch me ballroom dancing, rappelling, skydiving, or seeking my fortune at flea markets and estate sales. I'm fine right here in my dark basement lair, living in my head.This afternoon, The Pony and I took off for town to capture the readily available 44 oz. Diet Coke. They're as plentiful as bison on the Great Plains in the early 1800s. We make this excursion every day. Down the humpity bumpity gravel road, over lumps of exposed bedrock, into chasms constructed by rain run-off, across downed leaves and limbs left by squirrels and wind. I could start my own off-road-vehicle amusement park if not for the pressing time constraints of my proposed handbasket factory.Yesterday, midway between the neighbors' old barn and the first overflowing creek obstacle, I heard a noise from T-Hoe's right flank. The Pony heard it, too. I thought that perhaps a branch had snapped against the side, or a big chunk of rock was flung up to thump the undercarriage. We continued. Today, at the exact same place, we heard the exact same noise. Not quite a snap. Not quite a thump. Something in between. And a few yards down the hill, we heard it again. In the same place on T-Hoe's body.As we careened down and up through the messy, unpaved pig-trail that takes us to the blacktop county road, I started to worry that T-Hoe might grow lame. That perhaps he had a flat tire, or had broken some part of his suspension. It seemed like he was not proceeding as smoothly as normal. You know how it is. You drive the same car every day, and you can feel when something is different.We stopped for the mail, but I did not command The Pony to walk around and check for damage. That's because I had to park that side in a foot-deep puddle the size of a master bedroom, because the county neglected to replace a culvert pipe when they destroyed our road putting in a new bridge a couple of years back. On to town we went. When returning to T-Hoe with my 44 oz. Diet Coke in hand, I spotted the problem. Or so I thought.Hanging down from the undercarriage in the middle of the front passenger door was a wire. I'm not very mechanical, but I knew that wire did not belong. I looked closer. It was NOT something caught in the door that I had been dragging along, like a tie-string from a hoodie. It was dark gray, and kind of flat, and had some frayed, lighter-color brushy things, like copper wires, sticking out the end, just about an inch off the pavement. This was something I was definitely going to have to notify Hick about. T-Hoe's whole electrical system might short out. Or maybe I would electrocute us if I ran over the wrong thing.I climbed in and told The Pony to go take a look. \"There's a wire hanging down on the other side, up front under the door. That must be the noise we heard. We ripped something loose going down the hill.\" The Pony was none to happy to be commanded out of his limo-passenger seat behind me to inspect the vehicle. But he did. Because he's a good son. I put the window down on that side. \"Do you see it?\"\"Um. Yes. But it's not a wire.\" He leaned over. Disappeared from my view. I heard a \"snap\" and felt T-Hoe move slightly. The Pony brandished the culprit. \"It's a stick.\"Never mind. Nothing to see here. The universe agrees.

Paper plates holding yummy cupcakes that require her hands so that she can't type up any ideas just yet. But she's thinking about it. Yep. Our Val wrote the book on sweetness.\" Now that THAT cat is out of the bag, let's celebrate with a cupcake.Thank you to blog buddy Lynn for showing the internet world my true colors. Fie on those folks who describe me, behind their hands, in hushed tones, as a regular Sour Patch kid, except that first she's sour...then she stays sour. Yeah. That's not very sweet of you, is it? Shame on you. Take a lesson from Lynn and catch some flies, why don't you? They're not going to flock around that vinegary attitude of yours.Here's the catch, though. Even though I'm sweeter than a marzipan unicorn dipped in syrup, rolled in granulated C & H, charred with a blowtorch, and dusted with confectioner's sugar...I have a tasteless side. I don't always follow the rules. Rules are made to be picked and chosen by Val. So I am in partial compliance with Lynn's very special award. Three out of five ain't bad. I think that was a big hit for Meat Loaf back in the day, on his Bat Out of Not-Heaven album.Thank you, Lynn. It's an honor just to be nominated. I am rushing to post this before the first 13 on your baker's dozen list are aware. That makes me a winner!The Super Sweet Blogging Award is shown above. Tiny fairy and all. She doesn't know how lucky she is that I didn't chomp off a leg or arm in my feeding frenzy. The fairy, that is. Not Lynn. Val may be many things, but a cannibal is not one.Here are my responses to the interrogation necessary to receive the award:1. Cookies or Cake? I scream, you scream, we all scream for CAKE! CAKE WITH BUTTER CREAM ICING! Party down! Let's celebrate the birthdays of every single person on every single Sweet Blogger's blogroll. And their family members! CAKE!2. Chocolate or Vanilla? What kind of a choice is that? CHOCOLATE, there is no substitute. I think Tom Cruise as Joel Goodson said that in Risky Business. That, or Porsche. Which is stupid, really. What kind of flavor is Porsche?3. Favorite Sweet Treat? That's not fair. Sweet treats are like kids. You can't have a favorite. You must love them all equally. That said, Val's current sweet pet is Little Debbie Swiss Roll. She's so exotic. Yet domestic.4. When do you crave sweet things the most? Hm...that's a stumper. Not in the morning. At the end of the day. After a savory treat.5. Sweet Nickname? At the risk of appearing to scam somebody else's sweet nickname: SUZY-Q. And no, it's not because of my sordid history of snack cake consumption. It has to do with a part of my real name, and my indulgent relatives when I was a child, who did not consider being referred to by a snack cake name as demeaning.Dang! I wasted no time in responding, huh? I suppose that just goes to show that the quickest way to Val's blog post is through her pancreas. I'm sorry to report that I am now crashing after my sugar high, and will not be able to nominate a baker's dozen of other bloggers. It has nothing to do with the fact that I am blog-friendless after seeing Lynn's list, with only my two stand-up guys Stephen and Joe H. available to assume the candy necklace of Super Sweet Blogger.

I used \"goatee\" to refer to the beard on an actual goat!) does not seem to deter the fathers of her kids. Or else they just took advantage of her unfortunate entrapment in the goat pen fence, and never even looked into her blue, rectangular-pupiled eyes.

Yesterday I cut short the morning check-in phone call with my mother because I was driving and needed both hands and most of my wits about me. In doing so, I did not allow Mom to traipse down two sets of stairs and read her shopping list to me. I even cut off her verbal recollection of needing slaw...and whatever else might have been on that list. I called her again last night to make things right. Mom told me about her day.\"Did you know that your sister came out?\"\"No.\"\"She brought me your niece's garage door opener. Just in case I need to get in.\"\"Niecy has a garage? I thought she lived in an apartment over by Sonic.\"\"Oh, not Niecy's garage. Your sister's garage. Niecy still has a garage door opener for when she goes over. You know they never use the front door. Since I'm checking on the house while they're gone, she wanted me to have the garage door opener. I have a key to the house. I don't know WHY she wants me to have the garage door opener. I guess she thinks I'll set off the alarm. I only did that once. Then that other time the refrigerator went bad and the house stunk. And one time their dog got loose. Something always happens when she goes away. I think she might blame me.\"\"Yet she still wants you to take care of her stuff.\"\"Yes. She hasn't quit asking me. I don't mind. It gives me something to do every morning and evening.\"Mom went on to tell me about her trip to the store. This time she didn't tell me every person she ran into and caught up with. That's usually good for a half hour. No, this time, the main event of the town trip was... SHE FORGOT THE SLAW!I take full responsibility. One does not distract my mother from her mission. Now she has to go back to the store tomorrow. For her slaw. Shame on me. I won't be getting $8.00 again any time soon. That's for sure. Mom just called to ask if I was going to call her later tonight. That usually happens between 10:00 and 11:00. However...Mom said she has been working hard all day, and she might just fall asleep early, and sleep right through until morning. You don't have to hit me over the head with a pint of slaw. I could tell what she was getting at.\"Okay. I won't call later.\"\"Well, you can. It won't bother me if you want to talk. But I just wanted to let you know, in case you DIDN'T call tonight, that I'm getting out early in the morning to get my slaw. Around 7:30, probably. So in case you try to call me, I don't want you to worry that something's wrong. I'll be at the store.\"\"I probably won't even be up then.\" Ever since school has been out, I have not made my morning call until at least 9:00. But, you know, sure as Mom is away from her land line, I could call, and then get all worried, and be unable to reach her, because she doesn't hear her cell phone buried down in her purse while driving and in the store, and my sister the ex-mayor's wife is going to Vegas, and I won't be able to reach her to ask if she knows where Mom is, because you know how cell phones can't call each other with all that land between Missouri and Nevada in the way of their signal.\"I just wanted you to know so you wouldn't worry.\"\"Okay, Mom. I'll check in with you later in the morning. To see if you got your slaw.\"\"All right. I'll let you go now. I'm sure you're in the middle of something.

There are a finite number of slices of Veal Prince Orloff, you know.Here are some icebreakers to get the conversation flowing:Isn't that Ford Pinto a cute little car?Which fragrance is more appealing: Jontue, Wind Song, or VanderbiltDo earth shoes go with wide flare chambray jeans?It is okay to go straight from work to the disco in my burnt-orange leisure suit?Which is more thirst-quenching, TAB or FRESCA?Who did you bet on, Billie Jean King or Bobby Riggs?Is Evel Knievel going to make it across the Snake River Canyon?What's the weather tomorrow--should I wear my boyfriend's CPO, or my maxi coat?Does your dog prefer Gaines Burgers or Gravy Train?Anybody want to go outside and play some Jarts?Are Clackers a good gift for a five-year-old, or should I just get him a Pet Rock?Can you wear a mood ring while you're streaking?Hey, has anybody seen The Exorcist, or did you just stay home and watch All in the Family?Anybody want to come over later for some Boone's Farm Strawberry Hill and Jiffy Pop?What's a good brand of CB to put in my conversion van?There. That should keep you busy. I'll just step out to the kitchen and put the finishing touches on the meal. If you need anything, let me know.

I know! I hear your wails joining my own. Sweet, sweet, two-year-old Juno, my canine soulmate, rescued from starvation at the hands of my mother, who saw no reason to feed a tiny puppy dumped in her rural yard. Hazel-eyed, grinning, feathery-tailed Juno. Always there to greet me, morning and night, winter, spring, summer, fall.At first I was not aware of the seriousness of the situation. Genius and Hick had a little spat over replacing a pipe on the road down to the creek. Genius simply stated that Hick was mad about the way Genius wanted to do it, and also mad because he lost Juno. Silly me. I pictured them on our dirt road, digging out a pipe to put in a bigger pipe, while Juno frolicked down the creek and into the woods. She lives here. In the woods. No big deal. She'd be back when she was ready. That was at 11:00 a.m.Hick made himself scarce most of the afternoon. He came in to make a sandwich around 12:30. Didn't say much. Was kind of surly. I chalked it up to his disagreement with Genius. He was supposed to commandeer The Pony for pool work later in the afternoon. The Pony heard nothing. Didn't know where Hick was. Didn't care. Because he got out of pool work. At 5:30, Hick came in looking for supper. He had a confession.\"I lost Juno.\"\"You mean she STILL isn't back? Is she locked in the BARn? Caught in the goat pen?\"\"No. That's the first place I checked. She never came back from this morning. I asked Carrots if he'd seen her, and he said no. That when we went up the road this morning, he saw three dogs go over the crest of the hill behind us.\"\"Wait a minute! Carrots? He lives way down on the blacktop road. You didn't take my Juno down to THAT creek?\"\"Yeah. We went down there to get sand. I even went back and asked the people fishing on the bridge if they'd seen a little black dog. They said no. I've been up and down that road four times, knocking on doors, asking people. Nobody has seen her.\"\"What if she got hit by a car? What if she's laying in the woods, hurt? What if she got her collar stuck on a limb? Did you call her? Did you listen for her to bark?\"\"There were only two cars that came over the hill. I've been looking. There's no sign that she got run over. I don't think she was wearing a collar.\"\"She had one on, and it was too tight. I thought I told you to loosen it.\"\"If it was too tight, she didn't get it stuck on a limb.\"\"What if somebody in a car stopped and picked her up? She's the best dog EVER!\"\"I know you love that dog. I'll go back and look some more.\"\"You can wait until after supper. I don't want her to be in the woods and not able to get home. She won't understand why we left her.\"After supper, Hick hollered for The Pony to go with him. \"You can call her and listen for her. I'll go get the Gator.\" They were gone for a half hour. I was losing hope. I called my mom, because I knew she would feel my pain.\"And now it's been seven hours, and Juno still isn't home! She wouldn't stay away that long unless something was wrong.\"\"Oh, honey. That dog loves you. He'll come home when he's ready.\" Spoken like a woman who, after two years, still does not know the sex of that puppy she gave me after starving it for two days.I heard the Gator. \"I've got to go. They're back.\" The Pony skipped up the porch steps and flung open the door.\"She's baaaaack!\"\"Where did you find her?\"\"We were at that house at the top of the hill. On the blacktop road by the mailboxes. Dad knocked, and the guy said he hadn't seen a black dog. He said his dog usually goes wild barking if there's another dog around. Just then, I thought I saw Juno's tail across the road in the woods. Their dog took off running, barking at the woods. Dad and I drove down to the end of their driveway and looked across the road. I called and called to Juno. That dog started back to the guy's house, and Juno ran to us in the Gator!\"\"Was she happy to see you?\"\"I guess you could say that. She started crazy barking like I've never heard her before. I think she was afraid of that other dog. She jumped in the Gator with us. She was exhausted and panting. We petted her and started home.\"\"You brought her home in the Gator?\"\"Well, kind of. When we turned onto our gravel road, she got out. Actually, she JUMPED out. And followed us home. She's on the porch now.\"\"Make her come around back to the shady part.\" I went out the kitchen door. A lovefest ensued. The other dogs gathered around sniffing and whining. Good-for-nothings! They could have gone on those other trips and sniffed her out. When I went back in, I told Hick, \"I don't want her to run off!\"\"She ain't runnin' nowhere. She's wore out. I guess she was hiding in the woods, afraid to cross the road and come home because of that other dog. She sure was happy to see us.\"That's why you don't take my precious dog two miles down the blacktop road! Even Genius was mad this morning. \"I tried to tell him to take his truck, because I knew the dogs would follow the Gator. But no. He wouldn't listen to me.\" I think Hick learned his lesson. I'm sure he would rather have spent his Saturday flea-marketing, Goodwilling, auction-attending, fence-building, pool-freshening, or farm-hopping. But instead, he searched tirelessly for my Juno. And found her! I'm willing to give him a free pass on his next transgression. Not a free pass from the blog, of course. But from my real-life wrath.I think Juno probably lagged behind sniffing at some critter, then looked up and her pack was gone. She fiddled around, laid down, and then heard or smelled that other dog. Maybe she had a flashback to her tender puppy days when she was abandoned. When Hick drove by each time in the Gator, I'm sure she recognized the sound, and probably ran along through the woods after him. That could explain her exhaustion.Or maybe she just chased a rabbit for seven hours and was ready to come home. Good thing I didn't know earlier the true nature of Juno's disappearance. I spent the day thinking she was down by the creek, several hundred yards away. Not out on the county road.Sometimes, what I don't know doesn't hurt me as much."}, {"title": "Money, Money, Everywhere, and Not a Plank to Walk", "date": "Saturday, May 25, 2013", "text": "Saturday here at the Whineatorium, and have I got a story for you. It's true, of course. Not a dollop of fiction is dished at this establishment.Yesterday I went to the bank for cash. We operate on a modified cash budget here in Backroads. None of this flipping the debit card all willy-nilly when the mood strikes. No having our identities scammed by the gas pump card-slider. I'm sure it comes as a shock to you that I even utilize a bank, what with this perfectly good backyard and clothes basket full of odd socks willing and able to store our cash reserves.I am still adjusting to my summer schedule. Which, in all actuality, is like putting a ragtag regiment of two-year-olds, teenagers, and feral cats on a schedule. Nothing really gets done on time. Nothing really gets done. Imagine my shock upon arising at 9:00 a.m. to find a note written on a paper plate declaring that SOMEBODY really needed his Thursday allowance on Friday night, along with bowling money.The Pony and I hopped into T-Hoe and headed for the ATM. The ATM at our bank, which is a couple of towns over, due to where we lived when we first opened the account, closer ATMs be darned, what with their usage fees of fifty cents or a couple of dollars. To me it makes so much more sense to burn up gas going to my bank ATM. It's the principle of the matter. Even though I should be leery of showing my face there, after that unfortunate incident several years ago when I backed into that crazy meth-beard man with a bulldog on a chain.We pulled into the lot and noticed a line coming around the corner from the ATM. Well. It WAS Friday. The Friday of a holiday weekend. I waited. The car in front of me pulled out of line and went to the drive-thru lanes. That's when I noticed a truck parked in line with no driver. Huh. Go figure. Must have been some weirdo with a phobia about driving up to ATMs. My own father refused to order at fast-food drive-ups, and made my mom lean across and holler their selections. I couldn't see if anybody was standing at the ATM.I told The Pony I was driving around through the alley, and to get a glimpse of what that handwritten sign said, taped to a portable stand-up bank traffic sign. He replied that it said, \"Walk up ATM only.\" I glanced over to the back of the building and saw a 3-FOOT DEEP TRENCH from the corner of the bank to a few feet past the ATM. And there was a man in jeans and a faded orange t-shirt sitting on the edge, right beside the ATM, dangling his legs over the side of the trench. There was a piece of plywood in the pile of dirt directly opposite the ATM, like a plank to nowhere. I whipped through the drive-thru lane, made a sharp right to the alley, turned right again through the church parking lot where bank employees park, and back to the front of the bank. Looked like I would be going inside for a withdrawal.The only open teller asked how she could help me. \"I need to make a withdrawal, since I can't use the ATM.\"\"Oh, you can use the ATM. You just have to walk up.\"\"No. I can't do that. There's a three-foot trench.\"\"You walk across the plywood.\"\"There's no plywood going to the ATM. It's a trench.\"\"No. The plywood covers the trench.\"\"Well, I must have looked at it wrong. I need to make a withdrawal, and I don't have any withdrawal slips. I have a deposit slip.\"\"All I need is your account number.\" She counted out my money, a bit loudly for my liking, with people behind me waiting to knock me in the head like a thug on a casino parking lot following a winner.\"I'm guessing the ATM will be fixed by next weekend?\"\"I hope so. It's been going on for three days. This weekend is not a good weekend for it to be like this.\"I stuffed my money in my pocket. No need to carry an envelope advertising a withdrawal. Safely back in T-Hoe, I explained my experience to The Pony. \"She told me all I had to do was walk up to the ATM.\"\"Through that trench?\"\"Yeah. That's what I said. She told me across the plywood.\"\"Um. The plywood did NOT go over the trench.\"\"That's what I said. But she said it did.\"\"No. It stopped.\"\"Yeah. And that guy was sitting right under the ATM, swinging his legs. I'm so sure I was going to lean three feet over a trench and take out money with him sitting there watching me.\"We drove around back through the alley to get out. The orange shirt dude was bent over with his butt pointing at us, shoving the plywood across the trench. As if I would stand on a piece of plywood over a three-foot span. Maybe I should have laid down in that trench, pulled the plywood over me, and hollered for help.There's more than one way to get money out of a bank."}, {"title": "The Proof is in the Retail", "date": "Friday, May 24, 2013", "text": "Val strives to avoid controversial subjects such as politics, religion, corporal punishment, the death penalty, gay marriage, legalization of marijuana, and the bathed/cloaked in chocolate twin Twix factories. Looking for a timely, newsworthy story to be dissected into its component parts? Not gonna find it here. Until now!WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE PALATES OF THE PEOPLE OF NEW JERSEY THAT PREVENT THEM FROM NOTICING THEIR TOP SHELF LIQUOR HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH DIRTY WATER?TGI Fridays and several other restaurants were caught passing off fake top shelf alcohol. Some scotch was replaced with rubbing alcohol and caramel coloring! But at least that was alcohol. Even though the kind that might give you the jake leg, or make you blind, or downright kill you. Some folks only got dirty water for their big bucks. What's up with that, New Jersey? Here in Missouri, we would say SHOW ME the bottle! And we'd probably sniff it and take a swig. Just to make sure we weren't being bamboozled. Nobody gives a Missourian Mississippi River water and passes it off as alcohol, by cracky!I am not a drinking woman. But if I was, I guarantee you I would notice that my Maker's Mark did not taste the same. Pippi Longstockings riding a unicorn with her hair blown out! A child could tell that her drink was dirty water and not top shelf bourbon. Not that I recommend giving a child dirty water OR top shelf bourbon. They can drink the tears they spout over not getting dirty water or top shelf bourbon. It's cheaper.So what's the deal, New Jersey? I have not heard a rumor that your citizens are timid wallflowers, so meek they will pay out the patootie for substandard alcohol. Have they ruined their palates from a misspent youth of watering down the parents' liquor cabinets? Are they so wealthy they can throw money around being big shots, not caring about substandard beverages as long as they look like high rollers? Are they already so drunk when they go out that they don't notice their drink is not giving them a buzz? Let's get to the bottom of this mystery. Perhaps my cranky buddy Joe H. has some insight to share as an insider from the Garden State.The investigation went on for a year. It was started because SOME people complained. Seriously? A multitude of customers were drinking substandard alcohol for an entire year, and these restaurants remained in business? How does that happen?

The squirrels, bunnies, hawks, turtles, turkeys, skunks, and occasional deer. But yesterday was special in the Backroads fauna department. The less-traveled-by animals made an appearance.The least surprising encounter was with a slim dark snake sporting long yellow stripes. He was sunning on the blacktop, about two feet long. I suspect he was an Eastern garter snake, or some common garter. I was careful to pilot T-Hoe over his warming space to leave him undisturbed. I cannot stand it when I see a car veer to smash a snake, then back up and slam on the brakes in an effort to pulverize him. You're not going to rid the woods of snakes by vehicular reptileslaughter. He was in perfect health when last I saw him.Not an everyday sight, but perhaps a monthly one, was the broken armadillo. I swear, these unsuccessful road-crossers are nothing more than possums with exoskeletons. Sure,\u00a0 I know they are a different genus and species. But all marsupiality aside, they seem to travel the same circles and push their luck on the same routes. They are no match for swift strong UniRoyal.The most breathtaking of my creature dalliances was a HUGE beetle the size of two golf balls hooked together. His iridescent green back shone like mother-of-pearl. He reminded me of a scarab that might be used for decorative purposes on a wealthy woman's chest. Research upon arriving home revealed that he was a Green June Beetle. More remarkable than the sighting itself was the location.HE WAS INSIDE MY 44 OZ. DIET COKE STORE!!!That's right. There just inside the door of Voice of the Village was this scurrying beauty. I was stunned. My breath was taken. I wanted to call out to the clerk, \"Hey! You've got a giant bug in here!\" I refrained. That might have been akin to hollering FIRE in a crowded theater. By the time I filled my cup with my magical elixir, my new green friend had disappeared. A woman and a preschooler were lurking around there, looking down. But they didn't seem to be excited, so I think they were just seeking a snack of the cake variety.DANG! I never did gather the courage to whisper my find to the clerk. I left a bit shaken, associating that insect beast with the first food source that came to mind: dung. For beetles, of course. Not my food source. Imagine my pleasant surprise upon discovering that Green June Beetles eat fruit. Peaches, preferably.This encounter will NOT keep me from frequenting this shop.

The minute he saw through his front bedroom window that the deed was done, Genius arose from his slumber and began his shenanigans. \"Whew!

Unless you try Walmart. They seem to have plenty of employees these days. And by these days, I mean Monday mornings.Now that school is out, I can do my shopping whenever I please. Though I don't particularly recommend Walmart on a Monday morning. To start with, half the parking lot was gone. Yes. Gone. The whole blacktop surface was missing. It had just been scraped away by some heavy machinery. Yellow fake crime scene tape blocked off half of the parking lot. The half where we usually park. Not a space was to be had at the grocery end, so we put T-Hoe into a space almost at the Pizza Hut across the street.On Monday mornings, it seems, every Walmart associate is required to grab a ladder or a cart, or in some cases a ladder AND a cart, in order to block as many aisles as humanly/ladderly/cartly possible. The blood in those associates' veins runs cold as ice. That chubby one on the third step of the ladder did not even flinch when I reached past her butt to snag a large pink bottle of Color Me Happy shampoo. The gal blocking the Charmin Ultra Strong with HER ladder turned to give me the eye like a hornet revving his buzzer just before ordering his buddies to attack. No mercy there. I was fortunate that a colleague hailed her to help with a case of unknown cleaning items just as I was deciding that leaves from the back yard would probably tide us over until next week. A short dude shoved a bread cart at me on the frozen food bin/bacon shelf aisle. Yeah. Looked me in the eye, then let it rip. He was as skilled at his job as I am at kicking my doorstop four feet over the threshold, leaving it jammed under the door just opened by an entering student. That cart of buns careened my way, made a quarter-turn, and set itself right by the frozen chicken strips, across from the Hillshire Farms sausage section. Go meat!It was on the candy/snack aisle that I encountered the new hire. As The Pony went to fetch a Symphony candy bar requested by Genius, Newbie almost got out of his way! The Pony put the chocolate in the cart, and was then sent to complete his mission to find Velveeta cheese. I don't normally buy Velveeta cheese. I buy Marvella cheese from Save-A-Lot. It's the same thing. Genius and Hick like it melted with salsa for nachos. Of course Walmart does not put Velveeta with the other cheeses. Maybe that's because it's not really cheese. We've had this problem before. The Pony thought he saw it, and made three trips in search. While he was gone, Newbie came down the aisle to where I was looking at the Quaker Quakes Rice Snacks. Of course she pulled her cart, the better to block me. She was obviously a star at the training session. But THEN she proved her newbieness.It was not the sleek haircut, and slacks, sweater, and flats. The wardrobe was a sure sign. She was dressed like a former executive. Okay, that might be stretching it. Let's make that a Backroads former executive. In any case, she was better groomed than a teacher. The coiffure alone ruled out that profession. Another clue was her svelte, compact, lithe physique. If Walmart associates were shelf-stocking gymnasts, Newbie would have been a gold medal contender. But it was her customer service that revealed her short Walmart tenure. \"Excuse me. Do you know where the Velveeta is?\"\"Yes. It's on the aisle with the pasta and pizza crusts. About halfway down. On the bottom shelf.\"I knew exactly what she was talking about. I remembered finding it there by accident a while back. But Newbie went beyond the call of duty. She started jumping like a leaping Masai warrior.\"It's on...aisle...FOURTEEN! Aisle fourteen.\"I give her a month. We'll return and find her with a stained sweatshirt covering her dowager's hump, baggy mom jeans (acid wash) coming within six inches of her run-down New Balance, leaning on her cart full of empty cardboard boxes, huffing out a sigh that lifts her shaggy, graying bangs, frowning at anybody who comes near, biting her tongue to keep from cursing.A good job is hard to find."}, {"title": "Feelin' Hot, Hot, Hot", "date": "Sunday, May 19, 2013", "text": "Val is no tender hothouse flower.

She knows the set-up. I told her that since she would be on the floor, she needed to take the concrete steps. There are two sets of them at opposite corners. Catty-corner to each other. Walking down the metal bleachers is not recommended. They are the fold-up kind. That means they are not set in stone. Not bolted down. They sway like a Japanese high-rise on a shake platform. In addition, the handrails pop into the base. Handrails can't fold up, you know. The handrails are not continuous. You have to make a grab for the next one while you go down one or two steps. I did not want Mom anywhere near those septuagenarian-hip-thirsty monsters.I wandered about the halls, waiting for my faculty buddies to to arrive so we could swap various and sundry hard candies to slip down our Master's-sleeved black robes. I popped into the gym to see where Hick had set up his Genius-valedictory-speech-recording studio. I spied Sis sliding onto a bleacher over halfway down from the mezzanine. AND THERE WAS MOM TRAILING DOWN THE STEPS BEHIND HER!MOM! Hanging on to the wobbly handrail on the swaying bleacher steps, descending like an acrophobic, soon-to-be-eliminated Amazing Race contestant rappelling face-first down the side of Dubai Tower. With her septuagenarian hips!She didn't know I saw her. I must have told her fifteen times not to go down those orthopedic-surgeon's-dream steps.

We stopped to pick up some prescriptions, and a 44 oz. Diet Coke. Not at the same place, of course. But wouldn't that be totally AWESOME? Like a laundromat where you can drink beer while your clothes wash themselves. Only it would be a pharmacy where you can drink a 44 oz. Diet Coke while they call your insurance, put your 30-day meds in a 90-day bottle, discover the mistake, make you wait while they switch it out, put in a generic that you can't take, and make you wait while they switch it out.The pharmacy gang had their act together this time. They could have been a pit crew for Rowdy Burns, Cole Trickle's nemesis in Days of Thunder, so efficient was their choreographed drug-doling ballet. A trip to victory lane is surely in their future.The Pony and I arrived home a bit earlier than normal. Coming up the driveway, we spotted various fowl scratching and pecking. Hick's newest fine feathered friend, a very vocal turkey, was about twenty feet ahead, between the concrete slab behind the garage, and the fence that makes good neighbors. Cue the screeching phonograph record.IT WAS A WILD TURKEY!My brain just assumed it was Hick's gobbler. But no. This was a tall browny-gray wild turkey striding toward the house. On the other side, in the side yard by the chicken pen and BARn, was Hick's turkey. The wild one turned to look at us when The Pony squeezed the garage door opener and set off the grindy automatic door. Wild Turkey ran a couple of awkward steps and took flight. She heaved herself inches above the treetops, and disappeared down toward the creek.\"Great. Now you've made Dad's turkey mad. You scared away his lady.\"\"That's unfortunate. She'll be back.\"\"There he was, calling her, and she was headed right toward him. Now she's gone.\"\"He'll have to get over it.\"\"Look. He's still all puffed up.\"\"Awkward!\"Hick was not happy to hear that I had ruined a first date. \"She may come back.

Don't think I'm complaining one bit. No. Not Val. Far be it from VAL to voice her displeasure. Some of the kids are a bit more vocal every year. Not in a throw-themselves-on-the-tile-kicking-and-screaming kind of way. More in a general-grumbling-and-mumbling kind of way. Keep in mind that the criteria to be met for Reward Day is listed in the student handbook. It's in folder form, handed out to each student when schedules are picked up. Still, some of them must remember those hazy lazy days of lower elementary, when everybody got an award, and nobody's tender self-esteem was marred by unpleasantness.\"I can't believe I'm not on the list! I only went to in-school suspension ONE time!\"\"I was told it's only for second semester. That what you did first semester doesn't count.\"\"I was told it's for first semester. That what you did SECOND semester doesn't count.\"\"I'm passing all of my classes but one!\"\"I'm passing everything but P.E.\"\"You guys. Think about it. It's not really worth coming to school every day just to have Reward Day. You can miss way more that three days a semester, and those days you take off can be your own Reward Days.\"Sometimes Reward Day is a trip to a theater for a new release movie, with free small soda and popcorn. Sometimes it's a trip to a mall in the city. Sometimes it's a visit to City Museum, or a bowling fun center, or skating. Sometimes it's a barbecue at the park, or open gym, or DVD movies and snacks in the cafeteria. You never know. Today, it was an outdoor sports day with a barbecue to enjoy the 90-degree sunshine. The point is, students get a somewhat unstructured day with their friends to text each other and goof around. Don't think the destination is what makes the day.Some schools have reward days in which the students who don't qualify must take finals or do busy-work skills worksheets all day to remind them that THEY DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR REWARD DAY. I disagree with this reasoning. First of all, if a final exam is truly to be counted as a final exam, all students need to take it. Nobody should be excused for good behavior. Secondly, students who don't have good enough grades for reward day are punished by possibly lowering their grades even more with a final exam. And that busy work? It's cruel and unusual punishment. Because it doesn't matter if you give the unrewarded kids a pony and cotton candy, THEY STILL KNOW THEY ARE MISSING FUN TIME WITH THEIR FRIENDS. No matter how they try to rationalize it.\"It's so hot out there. I'm glad I'm inside.\"\"Yeah. It's nice and cool in here. We're not getting a sunburn.\"\"And they're getting all dirty on the softball field. Yuck.\"\"The wind would mess up my hair.\"Yes, those left behind know they are not being rewarded.

Yet they continue to build up. \"Oh, he wasn't there today,\" is the answer when quizzed on the never-ending worry.

That dozen on the top shelf are the little eggs for your mom for Mother's Day. She loves the little eggs. And those two cartons of 12 on the bottom are store-bought eggs that you've had in there for a while.\"Au contraire. The last eggs I purchased were for Easter. All but three of the two dozen were boiled and turned into deviled eggs and potato salad. The other three went into an Oreo cake. Let's not forget that Hick recycles the cartons. My mother does not love the little eggs. She does not even like them on a platonic level. She has told me before, \"I just don't know what to use them for. I don't know how many make a real egg in recipes. They're okay for boiling, I guess. Don't tell him that.

Then I poured a shot glass equivalent of Frank's Original RedHot Wing Sauce, and dipped the chips and ate them! Nothing. No taste. Incredible. I'd already tried consuming mass quantities of water to thin the mucus. Sucking on Hall's Mentholyptus cough drops until my tongue burned. Putting a vibrating thingy from a travel neck pillow on my sinuses to loosen the blockage. Tilting my head various ways. Standing in a hot shower and breathing the mist. Nothing worked. Until...Vicks VapoRub! Not rubbed on the chest like recommended. That only loosens the lung mucus so you wheeze and cough up liquid all night instead of sleeping. No, I'm talking about the hard-core remedy for a stuffed head and no smell or taste. PUT THE VICKS INSIDE YOUR NOSE!Oh, yeah! That clears a path! Of course, you will feel like your nose is disintegrating from the burning chemicals. And all of your food will smell and taste like you have dipped it in Vicks VapoRub.

The resulting headache and sinus pain has made me a bit woozy and unsteady on my feet. Kind of like a happy drunk, but without the fun, and without the alcohol.This afternoon I entered the master bathroom to change clothes for The Pony's spring band concert. Hick and I have a big walk-in closet in the john. As I turned to enter, a wave of vertigo struck me clumsy. A step with my right foot that I had planned to put into the closet instead struck the inward-opening door. Precisely, that inch of wood from which the door is made, hung between two hinges. My pinky-toe bent in an unnatural angle. A ninety-degree angle, for the geometry scholars and carpenters among you.You know how, when you hit your extremities on something, the length of your axons (some as long as three feet!) means that you know you're hurt, but you don't feel it for a second or two? It was like that. I knew Pinky had swiveled too far. But I couldn't look. Besides, I was not in any position to look. I was cartwheeling between the hanging clothes, blouses to the left of me, work pants to the right, and there I was stuck in the middle with a view. Of the gray metal circuit-breaker box, that is. Or service entrance, as Hick the facility maintenance supervisor refers to it. Whatever its nomenclature, it was rushing towards my head until I stuck out my right arm and stopped that wall from closing in.Then the pain arrived. Kind of sharp. I still couldn't look. What good would THAT do? Nothing can be done for a broken pinky-toe except for taping it to the piggy that had no roast beef. Who is probably already bitter about the roast beef snubbing. Anyway, I don't think Pinky has enough bone in her to break. She's one of those freaky deaky pinky-toes that is all triangular and meaty and pudgy, with an itty bitty crescent nail. The kind of pinky-toe that sort of turns under the next toe when you walk. Not a pretty little pinky-toe, all manicured and painted up like a hussy, begging to expose herself in flip-flops and fancy sandals.Pinky ached all through the concert. Quietly, because, while not pretty, she does have class. The sides of the shoe were constricting her like a boa around a bunny. But she maintained. That little toe jammed along with the music, throbbing to beat the band.I am thankful that Pinky did not pop off. That would have been as bad as a street sweeper running over her, and having some hipster doofus pick her up, plop her in a Cracker Jack box full of ice, hijack a bus, and drive me to the emergency room, while making all the stops.

Not to mention the lady who chowed down on her deceased husbands ashes.Last week I came across the new season of My Crazy Obsession. Imagine my surprise when my DISH Network on-screen guide told me the show was about a guy who ate bugs, and a woman who got food out of dumpsters. I clicked on it and thought, \"So what? A dude eats bugs. We all eat bugs. We just don't know it because we're asleep when they crawl in our mouths. Or their legs are in our cereal.\" Just because this dude ordered a big poisonous Vietnamese centipede and took it to a gourmet cook to surprise his wife does not make him all that special.The second half of the show was even less impressive. A gal got food out of dumpsters and saved a lot of money on her food budget. Okay, she went a little overboard by wearing an apron and cap from each supermarket chain where she invaded the dumpsters. And she DID take a bite out of a peach that might have been fly-blown after a day in the sunny confines of a metal trash bin. Then there was the matter of her FREEZING her expired food to eat later. So she was approaching the crazy benchmark even before she whipped up a meal and invited her friends to join her without telling them they were eating dumpster treats.

We all crowded around our wooden table after harvesting goodies from the perimeter. One of our group was noted for bringing the same lunch every day. A can of Slim-Fast. She would sip and critique our meals on a daily basis. I'm sure she brought something for the potluck. She was not mean-spirited or cheap, just a tiny bit of a know-it-all. Perhaps she brought rolls, or a salad. I remember that I brought a crock pot full of deer meat simmered in BBQ sauce. This school was near the Huzzah Valley. A rural setting. Venison was not all that exotic. In fact, when our feast was in the planning stages, I proposed my dish and received positive feedback. Apparently, Slim was not at the menu meeting.Slim brought her can of Slim-Fast to our banquet. She popped the top and took a few sips. Then she announced that she thought she'd try a little taste of everything. We did not begrudge her the tidbits, even though each of us had to stand and push in our chair as she went by. Slim quizzed us all on what we brought. Not in a manner that one wishes to avoid the fur-filled cupcakes from the crazy cat lady, but in a conversational way. \"What did YOU bring, Val?\" Slim sometimes treated me like a mail-order bride from an east coast city, perhaps because I'd been married less than a year, and she thought I was not yet seasoned in housewifely duties.\"Oh, I brought the BBQ in the crock pot.\"\"That is SO good! I'm going to have just a little bit more.\"Every pair of eyes at that table met mine. Hey! Slim didn't ask what kind of meat was in there. And she liked it. She really liked it. I did not feel obligated to announce its species. If Slim had said, \"Oh, the cow meat?\" Or, \"You mean the BBQ beef?\" I would have set her straight. But she didn't.After we all shifted to allow Slim seconds on my dish and some others, she returned to her chair and began to feed. \"Mmm. You got this just right. Is it beef?\"\"No. It's deer meat.\"Well. You'd have thought I'd blindfolded her and served her a casserole of great big gobs of greasy grimy gopher guts sprinkled with D-Con rat pellets. Slim shoved her plate away and hollered, \"I can't believe you did that to me!\" Like I was Ashton Kutcher without a camera crew. Seriously. Everyone knew what was in that pot. We didn't even think she was partaking of our spread. Besides, her own husband went deer-hunting every year. Slim stormed out. After her side of the table stood up to let her by. Perhaps she did some refunding like George Costanza's date.We were once again on speaking terms after the break. I even emailed her a few years ago about Career Ladder. I did not mention venison."}, {"title": "I Am Josephine's Coccyx", "date": "Friday, May 3, 2013", "text": "The Pony and I witnessed a lawsuit in the making today. And by witnessed, I mean our backs were to the situation, but we filled in the details with our keen skills of fabrication.There I was at the Walmart deli counter, not buying, just looking, for a baked chicken. They had none. Okay, that's not quite true. Old Mother Hubbard's poor dog could have had a hypertensive episode courtesy of lemon pepper chicken bones. But, like Old Mother Hubbard, I value the circulatory health of my companion. I did not buy the chicken with saline breasts.I heard a cry. At first, I thought it was a laugh. I looked across the deli counter, but my view was obstructed by macaroni salad, Amish potato salad, three-bean salad, and cole slaw. The plastic hairnetted emplyee behind the counter did not miss a beat. She didn't even turn to look toward the cakes and donuts. \"What's that?\" I asked The Pony. \"Did somebody fall?\" He got all fidgety and peered around the deli case.\"Uh huh. There's a lady on the floor.\"\"Go see if you can help. You're a strong young man.\"  A cake-baker had strolled out of her designated area to peer at Gravity's Victim.\"I'm not really all that strong.\" So much for making a Good Samaritan out of him. A man ran past us from the direction of the in-store Subway around the corner by the doors.\"My mom fell down.\" Wait a minute. How did he know that? It just happened. Was he watching on closed-circuit TV? Did he have her wired with a mom-cam? Nobody had gone past us the other way to tell him. Was this a scam in the making? He was a gray-hooded-sweatshirted, middle-aged guy, balding, kind of like Randy on My Name is Earl. He looked like he still could be living at home.\"Look again. Is she okay?\" A few people had encircled her, and my new vantage point beside the footlong sandwiches did not enhance my view. I gave The Pony a little shove.\"I think she's okay. She's sitting up now. And moving. Her head isn't on the floor.\" We proceeded to the checkout. I was there so long that the Gravity's Victim entourage caught up to me. Got in line right behind. A man hovered over GV, asking if she was sure she was alright. GV nodded her white head.I did not see what happened. Gravity's Victim could have been seriously hurt. She was no spring chicken. She whimpered for a while after her up-ending. Here's the deal. Backroads has been under a downpour all day. Walmart had numerous buckets set out in the aisles, catching drippings from the ceiling. It is possible that Gravity's Victim slipped on some water that had not yet been observed and bucketed. Her clothing could have soaked up the moisture. It is also possible that GV and her son noticed the buckets and worked out a plan to squeeze money from the tight fists of Sam Walton's heirs. Unlikely. But possible.I think Gravity's Victim, by not having a leg to stand on...has a leg to stand on."}, {"title": "He Ain't Savvy He's My Brother", "date": "Thursday, May 2, 2013", "text": "I really meant to title this \"The Ditty of Brotherly Love.\" However...I am too lazy to whip up some song lyrics.

Both Genius and The Pony received awards for ranking in the top ten percent of their respective classes. In fact, both currently sit atop the #1 position. That makes Genius Thevictorian a true valedictorian. Both boys also lettered for their academic team performance.Today, one of the faculty referred to last night's event as The Genius Thevictorian Show. I think she was kidding. I don't talk about my boys at school like I do here. Their performance speaks for them. Anyhoo...Genius was called up to the podium several times for various bragging rights. He was given a valedictorian medal to wear at graduation, an award for honorable mention in the Herff Jones Believe in You national scholarship competition, and recognition for all-conference and all-district academic team honors. As team captain, he held the wooden state of Missouri plaque denoting our school as district champions. That means they were one of the sixteen best academic teams in the state of Missouri. Not too shabby for a little Backroads high school with an enrollment of less than 300 students.Awards were also handed out to our district middle school students. The Pony was disappointed to hear that the middle school academic team earned a banner as conference champions, having an undefeated season of nine wins. Not that he begrudged them their success. He hung his head. \"We didn't get a banner last year.\" That was the year he was the leading scorer on the middle school. team. They were defeated twice.Genius leaned across me over the white plastic tablecloth to get The Pony's attention. \"We didn't hang a banner my eighth grade year, either.\"That is quite possibly the nicest thing Genius has ever done for The Pony."}, {"title": "The Somewhat Monthly Affirmation, With Val Thevictorian", "date": "Wednesday, May 1, 2013", "text": "I am rushed for time today, and have no idea what I'm going to write about.

The occasion was a statewide award event for Genius to receive accolades for being a genius. Him, and 99 of his cohorts from every corner of Missouri.But we're not here to talk about a nerd convention. Nope. We're here to talk about the ambiance of the lodging. Sorry, I can't work in a statement about how I spent the night at a Holiday Inn Express. I was at the H. I. EXECUTIVE CENTER. Okay. So it's not that special and it's not that accommodating. I'm sure you knew that by the time you got down to this line, because why else would Val be using perfectly good blog space to discuss it, right?I booked a mini suite because how often do you attend your son's genius convention? We had a sitting room with a fold-out couch, two puffy chairs, an ottoman, a desk, a rolly chair, two end tables, three lamps, and a big wall-mounted flat-screen TV. Whoa. It feels like I'm doing my end-of-the-year inventory already. The bedroom harbored a king-size bed with four flat pillows, a tiny upended shoebox of a closet, a mini fridge, a microwave, a dresser, two end tables, three lamps, and a flat-screen TV on the dresser. We'll get to the bathroom in a minute, as it is the cornerstone of Val's complaint manifesto.Let the record show that neither TV worked. Lucky for us we had a Genius along. He fiddled with some hanging-down wires and a black box thingy on the giant wall-mounted TV and brought it to life. The remote, however, was deader than a doornail. I didn't use those words with Genius around, because that always fuels an argument over the merits of \"doornail\" and \"door knob.\" When Hick tried the bedroom TV, he was rewarded with the blue screen of death. Genius fiddled and faddled with the cable box thingy until it displayed its channels. Left to our own devices, Hick and I would have gone out for Reynolds Wrap, fashioned some rabbit ears, and put them on Hick's head while he stood like an ample-drumsticked, pale, yoga-posing flamingo while trying to get reception.After putting on their thinking caps, one being a Jed Clampett design, and the other a six-paneled, multicolored beanie with a propeller on top, the guys deduced that the remotes had been switched. From then on, we had a sitting room remote that worked, and a bedroom remote that was still dead.The bathroom was a deathtrap. The tan tile floor was suitable for Nancy Kerrigan to skate upon just prior to collapsing in a pile of WHY after a vicious Gilloolying. I first ventured onto the killing floor in my well-worn New Balances. Bambi on ice was more sure-footed than I. Lucky for me, there was a sink counter I could grab to pull myself along like a beginning skater at the roller rink. I warned Hick, who scoffed, right before poorly executing a flying camel. \"Something's not right!\" Genius and his Adidas performed a lunge from door to second sink, and concurred.Always the problem-solver, I ventured forth in my dress-up shoes. Not a good move. I tried sock feet, and almost split myself in half. Even bare feet could not get traction on that slippery non-slope. Hick grabbed a washcloth while holding on for dear life with his other hand. He used a foot to mop the floor with his damp implement. He swore that the cleaning staff had sprayed something on the tile to make it shiny. He declared that his treatment restored traction. I assure you, it did not. Rising from the toilet required more coordination and energy than a triathlon.I think I have figured out the corporate benefit of the slick floor.

Still, I got up as usual to take The Pony to school.Coasting down a residential street at the allotted speed limit, I had to yank my vehicle over the center line to avoid a scofflaw. A young man in a red sports car thought he was going to run a stop sign and shoot across my street. He almost T-boned the passenger side of T-Hoe. I had the audacity to block his path. As I made the half-circle to avoid his jutting bumper, at least a car-length past the stop sign and three feet into my lane, I turned to glare at him. Wouldn't you? Or are you, perhaps, some lily-livered pansy who hasn't a drop of road rage coursing through your veins? Along with my glower, I said, \"Seriously?\" Of course he couldn't hear me. But something tells me he saw me. Because instead of squealing on about his business and crossing over the street to his intended destination, he pulled out behind me. Like a mouse after the cheese in my trap.You know I am a law-abiding citizen. I always drive the posted 30 mph on that street. No need to gas gas gas, brake brake brake on that section. It's only three blocks, and a slight downhill grade. I let gravity be my fuel. Besides, a sheriff's deputy must live at the end of that road, because his car is always parked in the driveway.Redcar Man attached himself to my bumper. Some might have termed what he was doing \"tailgating.\" I was in no hurry, not needing to be at work, only dropping off The Pony. I daresay I might have let my speed fall to 29 mph. At the stop sign, I made sure to come to a complete halt. I looked left. Right. Left again. Then I made my right turn.Redcar Man was not going my way. He burned his tires and careened left, in front of the deputy's house. So sad to report there was no poetic justice. At least I revel in the fact that I cost him valuable time and made him veer off course, all for his petty revenge in being caught law-breaking.Val Thevictorian.

Cleanse my palate of the bad taste it's left in my mouth.There was no plan to carry out this inadvertent act of marital sabotage. It was just a happy accident. There I was in the walk-in shower, surveying the items resting on top of the door frame, contemplating why my tube of hair conditioner seems to have become anorexic of late. If she was Jethro Bodine, she would have to tighten her rope belt a couple of knots. I know that Hick has been using it. And he has hardly any hair! He tries to be tricky, flattening out the tube from the bottom. Not like the way he squeezes the toothpaste in the middle. But he can't fool me. I do not use conditioner at that alarming rate.Funny thing. As I reached for my flattened friend, my hand must have hit Hick's blue disposable razor. That, or Razor suddenly decided he was not good enough for this world any more, and flung himself over the side without having the common courtesy to leave a note.Upon exiting the shower, I searched for Razor's remains. He was not on the floor. Not shattered, not broken, not bruised. I looked more thoroughly, though I stopped short of calling in a search dog. Razor was a real nowhere man. No part of him was in evidence. I went on about my post-shower business. After dressing and combing my freshly-conditioned hair, I turned to give one last cursory glance toward the shower.There he was! Razor was in the corner, between the shower and the toilet, up in that ninety-degree angle formed by the shower base and outer bathroom wall. Yes, there he reclined, all smug and camouflaged, his dark blue plastic blending with the pattern of the toilet brush upon which he perched. There. I said it. Hick's razor was laying on top of the toilet brush.I thought of throwing it away and putting out a new one. They're disposable, you know. Hick would never know the difference. Until he cut his throat with a brand-new razor that he assumed was the broken-in one he had been using. No. Better not subject Hick to a slashed carotid artery. I grabbed Razor between my thumb and forefinger and put him back on top of the shower door. It was a new toilet brush, I'm sure.

Almost an hour.There was tale I wanted to share, though not here, because I DO try to separate parts of my working life from my internet life. The thoughts flowed like milk out of a carton carried by a helpful butterfingered toddler. I grabbed my little notebook to capture my thoughts before they vaporized like a dream an hour after awakening.

It would surely win a contest, or be published, and bring me fame.

Apologizing does not make your offense disappear any more than kissing a dislocated elbow aligns the bones and ligaments again.This morning I saw a story on the news about a dude who entered the wrong house and took a shower. According to the report, Dude entered a neighbor's house. Or not. Because he lived a couple of streets over, and he and the homeowner had never met. Not exactly what I would call a neighbor. Someone from the area, perhaps. But not a neighbor you might borrow a cup of sugar from, or pick up the mail for when they're out of town.Not only did Dude take an illicit shower, he kicked in the door, rummaged through the silverware drawer, and rattled some doorknobs. The homeowner woke up to the door-kicking and locked herself in her daughter's room. Or not. Because the report quoted the woman as holding onto the door as tight as she could. Not a very good lock. She called 9-1-1. The police arrived and didn't let Dude use a towel.According to the report, Dude had been drinking \"several pitchers of hard liquor\" at a nearby bar until 4:00 a.m., then walked to this house, thinking it was his own. Gosh. Several pitchers of hard liquor! Dude can put it away! And of course, everybody knows that you kick in your own front door every time you go home. And take silverware with you to the shower.Anyway, in spite of the issues I have with this news report, the Dude situation became even more interesting when the station quoted \"Dude's Father.\" That's what it said under the written statement in a box on the TV screen. \"Dude's Father.\" Not Mr. Richard Dude. Simply \"Dude's Father.\"The statement made by Dude's Father purported that Dude is a really nice guy who is really sorry and embarrassed. He will be going back to college to study business. And he will not be drinking any more adult beverages. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate; he\u2019s a really good kid. It was a freak accident and he feels bad about it.\u201dSeriously, Dude's Father? The train has already left the station. Let Dude apologize for himself. His picture was flashed on the screen about ten times, along with his name. He's not anonymous. The fact that he's appearing before a judge in June means that this was more than a freak accident. It was not a cute little misunderstanding.

It happens all the time. One minute I'm watching a DVR of The Naked Castaway, and the next minute I'm waking up with my neck all cricked to the right. Still, I'm in a recliner. Not wearing a grass skirt (false advertising, Discovery Channel), sleeping all contorted in a cave with goat droppings as bedding.I require the proper ambient lighting for my chair naps. The overhead lights go off, and a table lamp on my right and a gooseneck fluorescent floor lamp behind my recliner go on. Most often courtesy of The Pony. He carries out the TV-watching protocols.Between 10:00 and 10:30 I call my mom so she can ask me if everybody's alright. I try to get off the phone by 10:30 so I have time for my before-bed unplanned nap. Last night fell I asleep around 11:20, and woke up at 1:15. First I try to orient myself. Like, is this the weekend, or do I have to go to work in a few hours? Last night, something was amiss. The dark. The basement was too dark. The TV was on. And my table lamp. But the gooseneck was off. I was a bit cranky about that loss of illumination. Now I would have to ask Hick to find out what kind of bulb that lamp needed. I can't go without my gooseneck. It's been with me for years. My mom had one, and liked it so much that she gave one to me and one to my sister the ex-mayor's wife for Christmas. Now mine was kaput. And Sis's probably still shone with impertinence on that non-reader.I walked across the basement, past the pool table, to flip on the overhead lights on the wall beside the piano. Then I circled back to that gooseneck. I figured I should turn off the switch for when Hick put in a new bulb. I pushed on that lever AND THE LIGHT CAME ON! Someone, or something, had pushed that lever from ON to OFF while I slept with my reclined head only inches away. Is the hair on the back of your neck standing up yet? Like mine was last night? I knew that Hick had already gone to bed before I got off the phone with Mom. The Pony went to bed at 9:00. Genius was in the shower at 10:30, and goes to bed after that. WHO TURNED OFF MY GOOSENECK?Tonight The Pony and I were on our own. Hick and Genius went to Cape Girardeau for Genius to compete with the school academic team in the state sectionals. We watched Survivor as usual. Then The Pony went upstairs to run a bath in the big triangle tub. \"Hey! It's not even dark outside yet!\" I heard him puttering around overhead, gathering his pajamas, getting ice from the freezer door. Then he was back. I saw his bare feet, then legs, descend the stairs.\"Um. Look what I found under the edge of the railing.\" The railing that runs along two sides of the rectangle where the stairs come down from the living room floor. He held out a palomino-colored leather disk about the diameter of a softball. Hick picked it up at one of his many tool show visits. He uses it for a coaster on the table beside his La-Z-Boy upstairs. That might be the real purpose of that disk, or not. It is engraved with a tool company logo.The hair on my neck saluted again. The Pony's voice quavered. The stair railing is on the opposite side of the living room from the table that houses the disk. Fifteen to twenty feet away. Over carpet. It's not like that thing fell and rolled. Not like we picked it up on a bare foot or shoe sole and carried it and deposited it UNDER the bottom rung of that stair railing.At this rate, I'm going to have to invest in a good depilatory for my neck hairs."}, {"title": "If You Wanna Get To Heaven...You Gotta Raise a Big Caprice Classic", "date": "Tuesday, April 23, 2013", "text": "A member of our Backroads family is failing.

She wasn't really a bloomin' flower. No more a flower than comedian Brett Butler was an example of grace under fire. That's simply the nickname she used for herself.

One particular Saturday evening in the fall of 19BLAHBLAHBLAH, The Arkansas Flower used that vehicle to purvey six girls across campus lanes to an Ozark Mountain Daredevils concert. It was a big deal, what with our university located in the very stomping grounds of OMD.Never mind that the distance the Arkansas Flower had to park from the concert venue was equal to the distance from our dorm, although in the opposite direction. It is definitely not cool to walk to a concert. Getting there is half the fun. Like Arkansas Razorback tailgaters, the concertmate crew prepared for that Ozark Mountain Daredevils event all day. Perhaps, or perhaps not, with various and assorted inhalants, potables, and ingestibles.The Arkansas Flower piloted that Caprice Classic into the parking space with six girls caterwauling OMD songs at the tops of their polluted lungs. She launched that behemoth over the yellow concrete curb stopper parking block thingy like a Saturn V rocket headed for the moon. Unintentionally. Six carefully coiffed heads slammed into the roof of the rolling party cruiser. Twelve eyes locked onto each other. Six hearts thumped in six throats as six semi-lucid concertgoers jumped out four doors to survey what the Arkansas Flower had wrought.Did you know that ten girlish hands can lift the front end of a 1970s model Caprice Classic over a concrete curb stopper parking block thingy?T-Hoe still needs oil."}, {"title": "Rotten to the Mower", "date": "Monday, April 22, 2013", "text": "Our egg drought is over.

Hard-boiled eggs, soft-boiled eggs, fried eggs, scrambled eggs, poached eggs, raw eggs, egg salad, deviled eggs, pickled eggs. Omlettes. Toys for the kiddos! Eggs soaked in vinegar until they bounce like rubber balls. Old-fashioned milk bottles to drop a lit match into, so a peeled hard-boiled egg will suck itself down into the bottle when placed on top. Personalized specialty spoons for egg racers. I'll do for eggs what Bubba Gump did for shrimp!My egg shack will need a catchy name. I'm leaning towards \"Egghead's Egg Shed.\" But that could just be an equilibrium problem. When my head clears and I'm on even keel again, I'll revisit the name game.Last night, Hick called me from the front yard. What? You think we're some kind of triathloners in training? Or working out with Izzy Mandelbaum? A Thevictorian would never hop off the Gator and run into the house when a phone call can achieve the same result. Besides, with the price we pay on phones, we might as well suck all the use out of them that we can.\"Send The Pony out here.\"\"Why?\"\"There's a dead chicken under the lawnmower.\"\"I don't really think he'll want to see that. Didn't he see enough corpses the summer you put him on the chicken deathwatch, after you let those auction chickens in without quarantine, and slowly killed all the leghorns?\"\"Send him out.\"I did. While wondering if Hick or Genius had been mowing. Had there been a decapitation? A case of yard rage? Did a chicken take yard-crossing lessons from a possum down the road? The door slammed. Apparently, the fowl postmortem had concluded. \"What's going on with the chicken?\"\"Huh. Yesterday I found about thirty eggs under the lawnmower. Dad threw them all away, because we didn't know how long they'd been there. We can't find all their laying places.\"\"What's with the dead chicken?\"\"Um. It was under the lawnmower. Right by where I found the eggs.\"\"Did a dog get it? How did it die?\"\"We don't know.

To elicit a flaming-torch-brandishing mob to call for Val's head on a silver platter, which they will then tip into a pot of boiling oil. Indeed, it is one in which Val tippy-toes along the razor wire of the high tightrope without a net, suspended over a moat of tooth-gnashing crocodiles with anger issues. So let's get right to it.Last week, I mentioned the illustrious youth baseball career of the early-elementary Pony. How he was not exactly a star athlete, and played on a team of scrubs in a league that allowed every player to bat at least once every inning, and did not keep score. Let's revisit those days of yesteryear, when everyone was a winner, and all players were equal.On The Pony's team were twin girls who were differently-abled. I don't know the nature of their abledness. They had some motor control issues, but were ambulatory and playing with full decks. Sweet girls, really, as best I could tell about somebody else's kids in which I don't have a vested interest. I make this determination based on the facts that they got along with the other kids, didn't have temper tantrums, didn't swear like sailors through hand-rolled cigarettes dangling from their lips, and didn't show up all painted like harlots in platform heels, halter tops, and gold lame' miniskirts. They came to practices and every game just like the other kids, and looked like Bobblehead Dolls in the batting helmets just like The Pony and his other teammates, but were a little more frail.Now I shall enter forbidden territory. The coach always batted the Bobblehead Twins 3rd and 4th in the lineup. Anybody who knows anything about a batting sport knows that your power hitters go there. The Bobblehead Twins were not power hitters. In fact, they did not seem to enjoy batting very much at all. They would come to the plate, look into the bleachers at their mom, and give a body-heaving sigh. If not holding a bat, I'm sure they would have given her the WTF, palms-up, shoulder shrug.I'm not lobbying for my own Pony, wishing he would have been batting 3rd or 4th in the order. As Tom Cullen would say, \"Laws, no! M-O-O-N. That spells, 'The Pony was a terrible batter, and belonged next-to-last in the lineup every week.'\" He was barely better than the kid after him, who stepped behind the plate every single time, facing the pitcher, and had to be stood to the side by the umpire. No way would I have wanted my boy any earlier, with a chance of batting more than once per inning, with me having to listen to the parents who forgot who he belonged to complain how he NEVER hit the ball. They must have thought their kid was playing in some We Actually Give A Crap Who Wins league.My question is, why did the coach put these two girls so early in the batting order? Was he bending over backwards to be politically correct? Was he patronizing them? Did he think he was building their self-esteem? Did he fancy himself to be their physical therapist? Because trust me, those girls were not headed to the major leagues. They rarely hit the ball. I think their main enjoyment came from picking dandelions in the outfield, wearing their uniform, and having snow cones after the game. Just like The Pony, with the exception of the uniform. If the coach was trying to make them better batters, why didn't he move that pitcher-facer up from the bottom of the order?Because everybody was supposed to bat every inning, the Bobblehead Twins sometimes were required to bat TWICE every inning, when the opponents had a lot of players and we had to go back though our order. You would think that coach would have rotated part of the batting order each game. Not his kid, who batted first, because he was a really good batter. But the others were mostly interchangeable, and several hit the ball more than the Bobblehead Twins. No need to put those little gals up there ten times a game when they did not seem to enjoy the batting part.What say you? Am I being unreasonable? Is this something that should not be questioned? Can you think of a reason that coach batted those girls 3rd and 4th all season? Or why he kept them together as a pair? I must be missing his point."}, {"title": "In the Spring, a Young Man's Fancy Lightly Turns to Thoughts of White Shoes", "date": "Saturday, April 20, 2013", "text": "Genius is off to the prom tonight, resplendent in his cream-colored tux with the cornflower blue tie.

Not the SOMEBODY who really needs to wash the dishes, make a sandwich, do the laundry, hand out money, buy some deodorant, straighten the house for a girlfriend's visit, give permission to leave school for two hours to have lunch at a Mexican restaurant, and stop turning on the light at 6:45 every morning. No. The SOMEBODY responsible for complementary footwear is the one who should have thought about renting them with the tux, and ordering his date a corsage.Seriously. Genius told me on Thursday that he needed white shoes. Like I was Geppetto, and could whittle him a pair overnight. How am I supposed to find white shoes in two days? I suggested that he call the tux rental shops and see if they had any. Huh. That was the stupidest thing he had ever heard. \"Mom. They don't just have shoes sitting around. You have to order them when you rent your tux.\" Nor did he cotton to the idea of checking out various shoe and department stores. But of course, telling your mom Geppetto is reasonable, because she can simply carve a pair in between appendages for her wooden son, who may lie like the dickens, but will find a way to get his own white shoes by hook or by crook, without burdening his mother.His date had the idea of both of them ordering cornflower blue Converse, but changed her mind upon checking prices. At least she had the foresight to think of her tootsie-covers. She probably should have thought about picking somebody's Easter lilies for a corsage while she was at it. Genius assured me that she would not miss a corsage. He also neglected to get her one last year. I don't suppose she'll lapse into a coma from the shock. Even though she's not his girlfriend, he DID spring for her ticket, and will be footing (in his black shoes) the dinner bill.

The official takeover happened three weeks ago. Surely they would have the new procedures in place by now. Last time I tried to call in my refills, that automated phone would not recognize me. So I had to talk to a person. Everything went fine with the pickup.Monday I tried to call in my prescriptions. No. I needed a person because the phone had never heard of my prescription numbers. All lines busy. Got through, put on hold. Got a person who took info because the computer would not take my vitals. It took twenty-five minutes to set up my refills by phone! Tuesday, I was too busy to pick up my prescriptions. Today, Wednesday, I called ahead at 10:00 a.m. Yes. They were ready. There was a slight glitch with one for Genius, but they fixed it. Said everything would be available by 11:30 a.m.I stopped by at 4:53 p.m. Got in line. The aisles are like cattle chutes now. One main line to pick up prescriptions, but to get anywhere near the other parts of the counter, you have to find an empty chute. I waited twenty minutes before getting to the counter. Then another twenty-five while one thing or another went wrong. The girl grabbed the bags out of the alphabetized plastic tubs behind the counter. She went to ring them up, but one wouldn't work. Oops! They hadn't applied insurance to mine, even though they had to the one for Genius. Then they discovered that they had given me 90-day bottles instead of 30-day. Then they had to check one prescription with the pharmacist. Then I discovered that they had substituted a generic to which I am allergic. Then they lost my insurance cards. Then they told me I might as well sit down, because they had to recount my pills. Seriously. This chain has a problem. They don't have four-dollar generics. Even though I am covered by two insurance policies, they will only run the prescriptions on the primary card. The sixteen employees who remained from the old store have not been able to master the new computer program. Sixteen people who have worked in a pharmacy for years.

Over an hour to walk in and pick up prescriptions that were \"ready\" after two days and two phone calls totaling thirty-five minutes. I could have found a group of black-market foreign-country toddlers to make my medicine for five dollars, the equivalent of a year's pay in their nation, quicker than the drawn-out torture I was subjected to by this new chain.I am ready to join three other patrons I know who have taken their business elsewhere."}, {"title": "Maybe I'll Put It on a T-Shirt to Sell in My Proposed Handbasket Factory", "date": "Tuesday, April 16, 2013", "text": "Perhaps I've let it slip here that I do not suffer tailgaters gladly.I'm not talking about those fun-loving, perhaps borderline alcoholic, sports fans who roast a pig (sorry, University of Arkansas), or grow, harvest, and grind wheat into flour to make their own pasta primavera, or serve up an elegant herb-crusted rack of lamb from the blacktop backlot of a football stadium.

And I certainly don't want that bungee-jumping pregnant spider to drop in with all of her 1,000,000 baby paratroopers springing off as she slams into the Puffs With Aloe box. Nor do I feel like a verbal jousting match with Genius. My old stand-by, Hick, had his turn only yesterday. So that leaves me with the placid Pony, and a bit of inspiration I got from my blog buddy, the Cranky Old Man himself, Joe H.Let's make one thing clear: my kids are not athletes. Mathletes, yes. But not athletes. We had not quite come to terms with this fact when they were small. Sure, The Pony was not competitive, and preferred a GameBoy to a bat. That didn't stop us from signing him up for the town baseball league. It was not Little League. As Tom Cullen might say, \"Laws, no! M-O-O-N. That spells The Pony understands baseball like a fish understands how to repair the bicycle he doesn't need.\"Not only were we lax in teaching The Pony the basics of America's favorite pastime, we were lax in signing him up for the summer league. So lax, in fact, that our neighbors, whose son bowled in The Pony's league, called to ask if we wanted him drafted on a team that night at the meeting. We said yes. So clueless were we that we missed the subtle signs that our boy was no Mark-McGwire-in-the-making. Like facing the reality that the neighbor, who knew The Pony, had set him up on the leftover team. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It was made of kids nobody else at the meeting wanted, and designated for the coach who was with his son at the Little League meeting.The town league had their own field, three diamonds worth, totally on the other side of town from where Little League played. The teams had uniforms, used a ball and bat and gloves, and that's where any resemblance to Little League ended. Score was not kept. Every player batted every inning. That's right. The whole order. If the other team had fourteen players, and your team had ten, then the top four in the order batted twice. Fair is fair. The coach of each team pitched to his own players.The Pony made quite a name for himself. They tried to hide him in right field, but he faced the back fence and threw blades of grass into the air. Assigned to second base, he shoved every opposing player off the bag. \"I'm second base!\" he informed the world. We thought he might stay out of trouble at third base. Hick stood along the edge of the field to keep him focused. Until The Pony disappeared when Hick's back was turned. Don't worry. He showed up on first base, scuffling with the regular first baseman. After a round of chastising, he stated, \"Nobody ever throws the ball to third. But they ALWAYS throw the ball to first.\" I'm sure that was a shocking revelation for him. Especially since he liked to run to third on the rare occasion when he made contact with the ball. And not by way of first. The last resort was placing The Pony behind the coach-pitcher. I don't know what that position was called. If the actions of The Pony were any indication, I would say that he played, Coach-Imitating Dirt-Thrower.His career ended when he came down with a case of Idontwannaplayitis.

I merely wish to give a glimpse into the soul of my intrepid junk-trader.Hick goes to the auction two or three times a week. Not the same auction. I don't even know where they are. He manages to make time for them between his flea market and Goodwill runs. This bargain-hunting behavior is his hobby, not his full-time job. Ever-helpful, he is always on the lookout for items that would please others. My mom had to ask that he stop buying her glass cake plates. She has no more room to store them. I, myself, requested that Hick cease contemplating the purchase of AUCTION MEAT. I can manage on our household budget. No need to buy a box of unidentified protein. The fact that the box was simply marked, \"MEAT\" was a deal-breaker for me. Now Hick has joined forces with Genius to corner the used camera market.Genius knows his cameras. He cannibalizes lenses and flashes, and sells the main camera bodies online. However, he does not accompany Hick to the auctions. A few Goodwill sorties are as far as he goes. Last night, Hick saw what he fancied to be a fantastic camera find for Genius. As he started to bid, a lady told him, \"I REALLY want this camera.\" Hick respected her wishes. He had a pocketful of money from his recent goat sale, but he held back. He knows what it's like to want a piece of memorabilia. Imagine his surprise when that lady nabbed her camera for five dollars, and declared, \"I can sell this for $180 on eBay!\"Hick licked his wounds by purchasing the lesser babka of the night's cameras. Genius was still happy as a clam to get the lesser one, and stands to make in the high two figures from it. Hick feels a bit resentful about the five dollar ordeal.

Through the week, when my 44 oz. Diet Cokes are off limits, I occasionally indulge in a canned Diet Coke, or, if I'm feeling particularly festive, a real Coke. Those cans are promptly placed in a Walmart bag hanging from a drawer knob near the door, so that Genius can recycle them when he needs cash. Hick built my office for me. I have an L-shaped counter, with my desktop computer, New Delly, so named by Genius, in the corner of the L. A three-foot-high counter with drawers underneath runs behind me, to my left, to the door. The right-hand counter is shorter, and holds my printer. This noise was toward the door.I jumped about three feet when that aluminum can clanged to the tile-over-concrete floor. You know the sound. Clang, clang, clang-clang. An empty can bounces. My first thought was that a can had fallen off the countertop. Or that the bag was full, and one had rolled out. Because in my basement lair, not only can no one hear me scream, but the laws of physics are suspended, and cans overcome inertia with no outside force acting upon them. Yeah. My mind was trying to create a scenario where this phenomenon was logical.I glanced over my left shoulder. Nothing was moving. I typed a few more lines. Looked again. Got up and turned on the light. The bag of cans was only half full. There was no can on the floor. No can anywhere except in that Walmart bag hanging from the drawer. I will herafter refer to it as The Phantom Can Incident. No explanation was ever found.All week, The Pony has been declaring that he hears things in my office. Not while I'm in it, of course. When I go out to sit in the recliner and watch TV, he hears things. Just last night, when we were watching a DVR of the rebroadcast of Wednesday night's Survivor that was pre-empted by the tornado, it happened again.\"Don't tell me you didn't just hear that.\" The Pony lay on the couch, typing on his laptop, glancing over the screen at the TV, and the doorway to my office. It's at the other end of the basement.\"What?\"\"That noise. in your office. It's the third one since you came out.\"\"No. That was your dad upstairs.\"\"Dad went to bed already.\"\"NO!\"\"Uh huh. I keep hearing a clicking noise.\"Genius was at a friend's house until after ten. So he could not be blamed. Hick was upstairs, in bed in the bedroom over my office. I might have heard a couple of noises. But I attributed them to (I thought) Hick upstairs in the living room. It's an open floor plan. The stairs go up through a big rectangle area. I can see the living room couch through the stair railings. We holler back and forth all the time.

Okay, before you go saying, \"Hold on there, Val, that's some CRAZY talk, giving babies Swiss Army Knives,\" let me assure you that I agree. That's not safe. And not economically feasible. It's wasteful. Everybody knows that babies don't need the corkscrew. They don't yet have the eye-hand coordination to open their own bottle of wine. That's adult work.What babies should be born with in their mouths are KNOONKS. That's a combiation knife, spoon, and fork. In this ever-changing, fast-paced world, who has time for only sporks anymore? Not this gal. Besides, the KNOONK is a palindrome. Which makes it cooler that a spork. A spork sounds like that dweeby kid in seventh grade who asked you to the basketball game to watch him be the team manager.Yes, KNOONK-equipped family members will provide me with less time standing at the sink, and more time sitting on my ample behind purloining select tidbits from The Pony's Easter basket.

The Pony was with me, Genius had scammed five dollars to feed himself between his robot practice and his girlfriend's soccer game, and Hick was on his own for the evening meal.I know Hick is not a gourmet chef. He's not even a Rachel Ray cook. If it ain't hot dog, Hick ain't eatin'. To make supper more convenient for him, or, some might say, to enable him...I left food on the top shelf of the refrigerator where he couldn't miss it. I DID stop short of putting a note on it. Surely even Hick could warm up some leftover baked chicken in the microwave, and open a bag of vegetables and dip them in Hidden Valley Ranch. Seriously. How hard could that be for a grown man? I'm sure there are unattended toddlers and single-digit latchkey kids who can whip up a winning Chopped meal with these ingredients. In 20 minutes.He could do it. Had I not restocked the wooden Everyday China paper plate holder on the counter by the microwave? Had I not explained to Hick Monday morning that I had mixed up the Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing powder in a tub of sour cream, and put it right beside that chicken? Had I not explained that I bought that bag of mini carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower florets for dipping? Let me answer for you: yes.Image my surprise this morning when I arose before Hick and went to the fridge to get my poor Pony a ham sandwich for his lunch bag. The top shelf was bare! Okay, so there wasn't that much chicken left, and I had expected Hick to finish it off. He likes meat. And, to be fair, the sour cream tub was still sitting there in front of the milk. Which could prove to be problematic, because I could find neither hide nor hair of the bagged veggies. I looked behind the water bottles and the cheese I cut last week. No veggies. I looked on the shelf underneath, on top of the whole-grain wraps and bags of shredded cheddar and mozzarella. No veggies. I looked in the crisper, though I told myself that the last place Hick would ever put veggies is in the crisper. I was right. No veggies.After my shower and fruitless attempt at a morning recliner nap, after getting Genius off to his W.Y.S.E. state competition, after calling my mom for our morning What Did Hick Do Yesterday chat...I spoke straight to the horse's as--MOUTH. \"Hey, where did you put the rest of those veggies last night?\"\"The REST of them? I ate them.\"\"The WHOLE BAG?\"\"Well, I looked at the side, and it said 'four servings.' But they were only 25 calories apiece. So I ate them.\"\"With dip?\"\"No. I microwaved them.\"\"Without anything on them?\"\"Oh, I put a little bit of cheese on them.\"\"A little bit? What KIND of cheese?\"\"That yellow sprinkle cheese that's in that bag. And the last of the slices your mom sent from Easter.\" \"You ate a WHOLE BAG of microwaved carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower?\"\"Uh huh. And that chicken. In fact, when Genius came in later, he asked what I did. I didn't even notice until I came back from the goat pen. The house smelled like that cauliflower.\"Yeah.

I WILL bag a meningococcal vaccine this week. Genius needs to get one for dorm-living in college. He is ready to send in his health documentation, and wants that shot yesterday. Might even display it on the wall like a hunting trophy.Funny. Genius is the kid who always made his little brother go first for a flu shot. Hates needles. Was told with an eye roll and exaggerated sigh by a candy-striper-looking young syringe-wielder at the doctor's office one year to \"Just STAY STILL!\" Now he thinks he's off to get this meningococcal vaccine on his own. I beg to differ. But first I have to ensnare that meningococcal vaccine, shoot it right between the eyes, taking care not to ruin the pelt.The county health center will not give Genius a meningococcal vaccination because he has insurance. \"Go to his regular doctor,\" the nurse advised. Even though when he was a kid, the doctor said, \"Go to the county health center.\" Times, they have a-changed. So much, in fact, that the county health nurse suggested Walgreens for all of our vaccination needs.The doctor's office acted like I was CRAZY, wanting a meningitis shot. Like I had asked for my boy to be injected with meningitis. The phone-answerer put me on hold to investigate such a foolish wish. The nurse who eventually picked up my call put me on hold again. Twice. Another gal cut in to see why I was cooling my ear in her virtual waiting room. Put me on hold. Said the nurse's name, and that she was ready to give me the information now. Transferred the call. Which the nurse let ring until it went to voice mail. Voice mail is apparently not dishing out meningococcal vaccines, either. I called back and got that nurse's extension number. She sounded surprised to hear from me. Val is not your usual patient's mother, easily intimidated. She holds onto her prey like a snapping turtle during a long, dry spell. Nurse said that the doctor does not give meningococcal shots. Oh. Silly me. I thought such a service might be provided by physician.I DID manage to inform Nurse that Walgreens gives those shots. Oh, yes. Indeed. Walgreens gives them. You just need a prescription from the doctor first. Which she could fax to the pharmacy. Yeah. I said somebody would drop in to pick it up. That's what retired grandmas are for.Next, I called our local Walgreens. Huh! A meningococcal vaccine, you say? What a most scathingly brilliant idea! Let's see if we have one of those. The female pharmacy rep put me on hold to check. A male picked up the phone. \"Yes! We give that! Let me see if I have a dose in the refrigerator.\" Put me on hold. A different female picked up. \"Uh...meningococcal vaccination? We don't give that. Who said? Huh! We don't give it. Maybe in the future. But not now. Why did that guy who said he was the pharmacist say we did? And that he was checking the fridge? Well, he must have been confused. We don't give it.\"I called the Walgreens two towns over. The one recommended by the county health nurse. Was put on automated hold for ten minutes. One caller ahead of me. My call will be next. Woman picked up the phone. Impatient. \"Yes. We give that. Yes. You need a doctor's prescription. Twenty-four hours a day we will give that shot.\"Alrighty then. The big game hunter returns from safari. Successful.

We were up to 13 of those rectangular-pupiled eating machines. The thing about goats is...they reproduce. Oh, those kids are so very cute when they're little, but they grow up to be voracious locusts who eat everything in sight. Kind of like teenage boys. Hick kept Nellie and Goatrude, our first two females, and their current babies. Plus another one that was too smart to get caught. So we still have at least a half dozen of the critters.I was not sorry to see them go. We were not really attached to the new crop. The most horrible thing about the whole auction scene is that Hick came home telling tales of what he could have had. \"Do you know I could have got a jackass for five dollars?\" No comment there. It would have gone over his head. \"And I could have got two of the cutest little ponies for only twenty dollars! A pretty little Holstein calf was a hundred dollars! And they had a pot-bellied pig from the St. Louis Zoo children's petting zoo! Chickens were seven to nine dollars each! And the guineas were going for TWENTY-TWO DOLLARS APIECE!\"You can imagine how his excitement sent a shiver of fear through me. We don't need any more animals. I mentioned that people can't afford to feed their pets. That's why things were so cheap. As far as those guineas go, I'm sure people think they are pretty and would look nice roaming around the yard. But they are hateful, hateful birds. The bullies of the fowl world. We had two, and another appeared out of nowhere, and they bite the chickens on the butt just for spite, and have the most annoying scream ever. We hate the guineas. I wish Hick would take them to the auction and get rid of them.This morning while I was puttering around the kitchen I heard Hick step out onto the front porch in his underwear. He started gobbling. You know turkey season opens Monday, right? I'm sure that's a fact of which you're all aware, even though you may live in the city, or another state entirely. Hick has never been a turkey hunter. I went to look out the living room window. In the trailer attached to his truck was a big white turkey. Here we go again.Our neighbor is a turkey hunter. We have given him permission to hunt on our land. I told Hick he needs to get over there tonight and let him know that we have a turkey. Otherwise he might go crazy calling it and waiting for it to walk down to the creek where he can shoot it. At least he knows that a white turkey is not what he's hunting for. Still. To get his hopes up hearing it respond to his call would just be cruel.After all, that's the neighbor who saved me when I locked myself out of the house a couple weeks ago."}, {"title": "Her Mouth Hangs Open in a Silent Scream", "date": "Saturday, April 6, 2013", "text": "Along the county road, nobody can hear you scream.Yes, that's EmBee, our loyal, trusty mailbox.

This evening, for instance.The Pony and I pulled over to the side of the road by the mailbox row. It was just after 5:00, near the time when normal people with normal jobs would be getting home and picking up their mail. We, on the other hand, had spent the day at a science fair, picked up papers for me to grade, and completed the weekly Walmart marketing. I put my Tahoe into park and turned it off. No need to let him guzzle gas while we waited on The Pony to take his own sweet time to climb out and gather the mail from our green metal pipe. The one not big enough to hold two tubes of Clearasil Vanishing Creme. While waiting, I spied a dark blue SUV on our gravel road to the left. Parked there, creekside, for no reason. It's not like they had a kid out peeing in nature, or throwing our homeowners-association-paid-for gravel into the babbling brook. They must have seen us stop. Because the SUV started up. Pulled forward about three feet. Slammed on the brakes. Pulled forward another three feet. And sat there. Idling.I swear. It was like a horror movie. Like the original Halloween, when Michael Myers drives that creepy stolen mental hospital station wagon down the street and slams on the brakes when Jamie Lee Curtis's whorey friend Annie hollers, \"Hey, jerk! Speed kills!\" before she is strangled in the garage in a car with fogged-up windows. Or like those dudes in the commercial messin' with Sasquatch, letting him get near the door handle, then gassing the car, then letting him catch up, and doing it again.When The Pony got out, the blue SUV started up the gravel road. Slowly. In fact, after letting The Pony back in, I caught up to it before it hit the second curve. The driver must not have liked that. He put the pedal to the metal. I told The Pony this dude was either a cut-through or a dweller. Of course, now that I think of it, those are really the only two things a person could be doing up in here. Cutting through, or living on these roads. Unless, of course, they're casing the place for a robbery. But this one was moving at a good clip. Knew when to drive on the wrong side of the road to avoid the Great Chasm worn by days of heavy rainfall runoff. The cloud of dust from his tires billowed around me.WAIT A MINUTE! That's backwards! I am the one who lets a tailgater eat my dust. But now I was being fed! I was the eater, not the feeder! I might as well have been Elaine walking down the street in the Bizarro World with Kevin, Gene, and Feldman. The forces of the universe were off. But I didn't let that deter me. A little bit of dust never hurt ol' Val. Soon we were in a high-speed chase fueled by gravel-road rage and paranoia. I WOULD find out who this interloper was! I daresay speeds approaching 30 mph were achieved. Nobody runs from vigilante justice like that unless they have something to hide.Alas. The dark blue SUV went up the road past our homestead. The dead end road. No outlet. A dweller. I stopped short of pursuit with intent to check complexions and medicine cabinets.SOMEBODY has our Clearasil!"}, {"title": "On Tuesday, Crime Paid", "date": "Thursday, April 4, 2013", "text": "I have a bone to pick with a certain dead-mouse-smelling employee.We have been expecting a package to arrive any day now. The order was placed last week, the website said it would be delivered in 2-3 business days, and it's time. Past time. So I went to the email that announced my package had shipped, and clicked on the confirmation number. On Monday morning, it was in the city, sorted, ready to go out. But here it is Thursday already, and we don't have our package. Val, herself, could have walked that package to Backroads in that amount of time. WITH breaks along the way for 44 oz. Diet Cokes.I checked the confirmation number again. THAT PACKAGE WAS DELIVERED ON TUESDAY AT 11:23 A.M.! We don't have the package. I checked with Genius, who picked up the mail that day. Nope. No package. Just magazines and junk mail, which he piled on the kitchen counter. This morning I had The Pony get out and look all around the mailbox. Ours is in a long wooden box of mailboxes on the county road. Hick built us a breathtaking mailbox out of metal pipe, and painted it John Deere Green on the outside, and yellow on the inside. It has a round metal door on the end that closes with a magnet. Other people in our wooden box have regular mailbox-shaped mailboxes. Each in its own wooden cubby. A small wooden addition has been built onto the east end, to accommodate people who have move in since the mailbox condo was built and sunk three feet into concreted holes on metal legs. The Pony's search, like a lady in the era of A League of Their Own, revealed nothing.During my plan time, I called the dead-mouse-smelling post office. A somewhat disgruntled man took my name and address and confirmation number, then told me that no rural carriers work out of that office any more. He suggested I contact a town-over local post office. At that number, a somewhat disgruntled woman jumped right to the confirmation number. Then announced, \"Let me turn on my computer.\" HELLO! It was 9:30 in the morning. What goes on in these dens of disgruntleddom? The first thing I do when entering my classroom is fire up the old computer. I smell a package-smashing contest or mousetrap-emptying-and-setting party. She put me on the dead silence of hold for over five minutes. You can't get rid of Val that easily. I graded some make-up work and gathered items for an absent student. Multitasking is my middle name.When Federal Frownie came back to check the line for breathing, I was right there. \"HELLO!\" I really said it that time. I was not just scream-typing it for effect. \"Did you find my package?\"\"What's your address?\"\"1313 Steal My Mail Lane, Backroads, Missouri. I'm wondering if it was put in the wrong mailbox, or if the carrier brought it back to the office. We didn't get an orange card. We're on a row of mailboxes.\"\"Hold on.\"Deceased rodent in a dead-mouse-smelling post office! Can the United States Postal Service not afford Muzak? I printed updated rosters and seating charts for my substitute tomorrow. I am a new-student magnet. Fifteen updates to that sub folder since first quarter. That's gotta be some kind of record. With my luck the Most New Students in Three Quarters Trophy will be mailed to me. Federal Frownie knew that she was not losing this inquiring mind. She got back on the line.\"Your carrier says it would not fit in your mailbox. So he laid it on top of the mailbox, inside the wooden box.\"\"Well, it's not there. We never got it.\"\"Try looking on top.\"\"We already checked all around the wooden box, and in the others in the row.\"\"Did you ask your neighbors? Would one of them have picked it up on accident?\"\"One of them might have picked it up on purpose. From plain sight on top of the mailbox. It was from The Medicine Shoppe. Not something that should have been laid out.\"\"I don't know what to suggest other than to check with the neighbors.\"\"Well, now we don't have our package. So in the future, if the package doesn't fit in the box, I think the carrier should probably leave an orange card that says it doesn't fit in the box. That seems to have been the policy in the past.\"\"I'm sorry.\"Yeah. Sorry. So I'm out a package of medicine, and the carrier can pick and choose what policy to follow, and perhaps help himself to a package of medicine when his own dead-mouse odor gets too strong, and the United States Post Office is off the hook. Because they're SORRY. You bet they're SORRY! A SORRY excuse for a mail delivery system.

So I figured that since people are genuinely interested in this subject, I will avail my proposed handbasket factory to educate the prepping masses. Yep. When I'm not hefting a hammer, hacking away at those highly-crafted handbaskets, I will offer classes in how to select your doomsday companions.I saw one of the prepper shows where some aging hippie folks lived in an old missile silo. It was underground, of course. But they had it tricked out so you wouldn't notice too much. And they had a little group of people that they were planning to share their abode with when doomsday comes a-callin'. Apparently they put a lot of thought into it. However...they looked like the meekiest band of meeks that ever meeked, just sitting ducks waiting for their recently-inherited earth to be ripped from their grasp as the non-meeks pounded them into a pulp. Hippies are not the best at designing a security plan, it seems. I, myself, could have wrested power, property, and probably pot away from these withered flower children. How hard is it to take down a harpist? And I swear, when they wanted to address the group, they passed around a flute of some sort like it was the conch in Lord of the Flies.But getting back to my plan...every post-apocalyptic society needs a hoarder. That's right. A hoarder. Forget the mechanic and the doctor and the chef and the farmer. Surely you've see those shows, too. Hoarders. Hoarding: Buried Alive. So you must see what I'm getting at. How hard could it be to overpower a hoarder? To kidnap one, even. They're not exactly working out in there like a prison inmate who does billions of pushups and situps in his cell each day. Hoarders are soft. Cushy. Plump. Or a bag o' bones. And forget fighting back. They may have many a weapon, some new in the box piled up near the ceiling, but they can't get their hands on it quick. Taking supplies from a hoarder would be like taking candy from a baby. Except you probably wouldn't want to put it in your mouth.Of course, you would not want to injure your hoarder. Nope. Just trick him. Puff in some smoke to calm him like a bee. Blindfold him with some old clothes laying around, and lead him out of his house like a horse from a flaming barn. Explain how sad you are that all of his hoard perished. BUT...you can set him up with new stuff. See? You can go out into the post-apocalyptic landscape and scavenge and plunder, while your own supplies are safe, under the care of a hoarder. The hoarder will be ever-vigilant. Fool him once, shame on him. Fool him twice...I don't think so.An added bonus of having your own hoarder is that you never know what you might salvage from his stuff that you didn't really destroy. You might have to trade it, or make it into something he won't recognize. But you will have one of everything at your disposal.Also, the hoarder is unlikely to complain. He's used to having no running water. No refrigeration. No working toilet. He will pee and poop in a baggie if you ask him to. And don't worry about feeding him. If any of your foodstuffs look iffy, smell like they've gone over, just don't seem quite edible...give them to the hoarder. It will be a delicacy as far as he's concerned. No need to worry about where the hoarder will sleep. Give him an old bathrobe for a blanket, and a tiny hollowed-out space in which to curl up, and he'll arise bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, if a bit rumpled.All in all, the hoarder's benefits outweigh any doubts of his mental stability. He will be an asset to any burgeoning colony.No charge for your first lesson."}, {"title": "Val is Unprogressive and Unresponsive", "date": "Tuesday, April 2, 2013", "text": "Electronic gewgaws and I are not simpatico.I would gladly welcome the return of quill pen, parchment, and courier for communication purposes.

Lately, it has been two or three a day. I know that during the winter, laying drops off. But I think I have discovered another reason for our chicken-fruit decline.Mid-morning, I saw Ann the black lab/shepherd mix sitting under the leafless lilac bush. Something seemed odd. Suspicious. She turned to chew on her tail for a minute. I couldn't really catch her at anything. As we got ready to run to town for a 44 oz. Diet Coke, The Pony announced that Ann had an egg. During the drive, I expounded upon my theory that Ann was eating the eggs as fast as the chickens could lay them. Since those darn chickens roam around the yard and porch, rarely entering their custom-made chicken house, Ann thinks the egg situation is finders keepers. That's why she has grown so portly of late, on the same dry food ration as always.The Pony argued that if Ann is eating all those eggs, one would at least expect her coat to be glossy and shiny. I know what he was doing. Taking Hick's side in the great Juno is the devil on four legs debate. Seriously. Just because she has a beautiful silky coat does not mean that Juno is an egg-eater. German shepherds have course undercoats. Ann looks mostly like a german shepherd. Even though her lab side makes her stack food scraps such as bread slices and chicken strips like casino chips before wandering off to enjoy them.The Pony and I returned home from town around noon. \"Hey, look. Ann is on the porch with her egg.\" Indeed, she was. She picked it up and backed away when she saw me staring at her. Then she tended it all afternoon. Quite a tender retrieving mouth she has, not to damage a fresh homegrown egg. Those things are fragile. Like...like...eggshells.Here she is contemplating her next move.Don't let her unkempt fur and laid-back ears fool you. She's an egg-eater. See it there in her mouth? That tasty brown fresh egg from a free-range chicken?My dear sweet much-maligned Juno wanted some of the action. No dice from the casino-chip-stacking queen. I'm sure there was some posturing going on here. Too bad my blog does not have growl-a-vision. No way would my dear sweet Juno stand at attention like that, so still, unless contemplating a coup. Please disregard her glossy coat. I'm sure it's due to her presumed border collie genes.Contrary to the retina-incinerating brightness of that photo, they are in the front yard again under the lilac twigs, not on the surface of the sun. The Pony's phone camera must have issues. But it still captured the brown egg in Ann's mouth.No rest for the wicked weary. Ann needed a midday siesta. Yet she could not leave her purloined egg unattended. What's an egg-thief to do? Well...use the egg for a pillow, of course.The provocateur Ann has chosen the part of the yard in which my dear sweet Juno is wont to roll and cavort with her assorted toys and random animal bones.With Ann so preoccupied today with that one egg, Hick reported a harvest of five from about the grounds this evening.

Seriously. My deviled eggs ROCK! One time, before I wised up and saw my colleagues bringing loaves of day-old bread, and bags of frozen corn, I even made them for our Thanksgiving potluck at school. They were all the rage. One of my lunch tablemates still speaks wistfully of them every November. They are a staple at our family holiday gatherings.Yesterday, I boiled two dozen eggs so they would be ready to make fresh this morning. It's not like instant oatmeal or Stove Top Stuffing. They take some time. The egg white is merely the artist's canvas. A tippy canoe to be filled with mustardy nectar, and topped with two olive-slice life preservers.The eggs were store-bought. Grade A Large. We get bigger ones from our chickens, and more colorful, too. But fresh eggs are very hard to peel after boiling. I'm sure there's a secret ingredient to add to the water, but I haven't been actively seeking the remedy. I used my big stainless steel copper-bottom pot. After boiling, the eggs were treated to a cold soak for about half an hour. Then they were placed in the sink drainer to air dry. Their final destination was back into their foam carton to rest on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator overnight.This morning I put my other projects in motion and settled down a the kitchen table to peel the eggs. It's a tedious job, but eggs don't peel themselves. I tapped. I rapped. I rolled. I massaged the tip against the table. I did everything but give each egg a happy ending. I was sure those eggs were ready to disrobe in one continuous motion. Some eggs, however, had other ideas.You would have thought they hailed from the Victorian Era. Those eggs put up quite a fight to keep their outerwear intact. Their skin would not come off. Jame Gumb would have been sorely disappointed. The only headway I made was in ripping away small chunks of shell and attached flesh. Those egg whites stuck to the shell like asphalt-parking-lot gum to the sole of a mid-July Croc. There was no separating them.By the time I had finished, about one hour after starting, some eggs were not fit for the family table. Their fate lay in the testing arena. After all, some eggs must be sacrificed to taste the filling. The test subjects were not things of beauty. Had they been babies, I think we all can imagine our handsome pediatrician calling them \"breathtaking.\" The were as pockmarked as Edward James Olmos in Stand and Deliver. A few looked as though Injun Joe had whittled them in McDougal's cave with a Bowie knife, after he had eaten the candles.This photo does not do those bad eggs justice.

And they have a writing group. I was sure that was what she was getting at. Why else would she call me all breathless with the news? \"Well, I don't know if any of my gals write mystery. At least enough to be in a mystery-writer's group.\"\"Oh, I just thought you might want to hear about this.\"\"Did you read the article?\"\"Read it? No.\"\"Then why would you call all excited about it? Just because you thought I might know somebody in it?\"\"Well, it said, 'A SISTERHOOD IN CRIME!'\"\"Wait. Did you think they were going out and committing crimes and then writing about it?\"\"Uh...yes. That's the first thing I thought of.\"\"Mom. It just means they all write about crime. That's their connection.\"\"Oh. I'll let you go. I just thought you might want to read it.\"I kind of forgot about the whole thing until that darn article popped up on Google News. I didn't even have to search through those one-line things on Yahoo! Of course I clicked on it to see what the hubbub was all about. I called Mom back this evening to update her.\"I don't know any of the writers mentioned in that article. But you'll be relieved to know that they don't go out and commit crimes. They get ideas from places they visit and things they read and guest speakers that come to talk to their group. You don't have to worry about them committing crimes.\"\"All right.

I see anarchy on the horizon of Backroads.Just this morning, my dear sweet mother, she who exalts me alternately as her eight-dollar daughter or her five-cent daughter, was nearly bowled over by a person of Walmart. A person of Walmart exiting through the enter door. Before you go defending the offender because you assume that a person of Walmart can't read the door, so is not at fault, but is a victim of the public education system...let me elaborate on the scenario.Mom had ridden along to pay the house bill with The Pony and me. Being more of a five-cent daughter today, I asked Mom to meet us along the route so that I would not have to go out of my way to her house and back. Mom was agreeable, because she had plans to stop by the store later anyway. We had a fine time chewing the fat while I piloted the Tahoe to the next town.Among things I learned on our trip is that Mom has decided she will say what she thinks. \"I figure that at my age, I'm done with giving in to people. I went to pay my Christmas club, and the credit union lady asked me if I wanted to be on the board. I told her, 'No. I do NOT want to be on the board. I was on the board one time, and they only meet twice a year. Then I have to see them at the annual dinner, and they all act like they're my best friends.' And there's that one guy (name redacted) I don't like. I wonder if he's still on the board. Surely he's retired by now. Oh! I never could stand him! Those people didn't like me anyway, and then to pretend they were my friends once a year was too much.\"Next, Mom said that she was afraid she'd made her friend in Florida mad. \"She sent me an email saying that she's been having dizzy spells, so she quit taking her heart medicine. I sent one back saying that I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to just stop taking heart medicine. She has her whole family depending on her. She said that since the dizzy spells, she only drives a block to the grocery store and back. I know how she's trying to be cautious. I'm always really careful that I don't drive through the wall or anything. Did I say that? I mean, I'm careful not to back into a pole or something. But just because she doesn't want to go to the doctor before her May appointment, she can't be deciding on her own to stop the heart medicine. I emailed her that she should call the doctor's office and ask what they think. After I sent it, I thought, 'Well, I'm not going to hear from her for a while now.'\"Among the things my mom learned on our trip is that The Pony is perhaps more visually-challenged than we think. Because when we came up the driveway yesterday, and saw Juno running around to the garage door, we had differing opinions on her limp. I said she was still holding that foot up like she does about fifty percent of the time. The Pony disagreed. \"No. This time she has a reason. Look. There's something stuck on her foot.\" I said it was just the fur between her toes. \"Nooo. Look. Something is stuck to it. Like a dead mouse.\" Really? REALLY? It was just toe fur. I don't know why The Pony thinks a dog would run around with a dead mouse stuck to her foot.One thought that occurred to me was that I might need to keep closer tabs on Mom and The Pony when he spends the day and night with her. What with them crashing through store walls and hallucinating dead mice on dog feet and all.Anyway, getting back to the scofflaw who nearly took down my own personal septuagenarian...he KNEW he was coming OUT the IN door. Mom had to jump back behind me, since we couldn't walk in side-by-side with the crowd of scofflaws rushing out. The first guy, with his woman walking right beside him, said, \"Oh. Sorry. I think we're going out the wrong door.\" But he did not stop and step five feet to the left to exit through the OUT door. Nope. He made Mom be nimble and quick to avoid being flattened faster than Sam Bradford of the St. Louis Rams. Let's just say Mom's candlestick-jumping days are over. She tucked in behind me like a NASCAR driver drafting at Daytona. Just in the nick of time to avoid a seven-person pile-up.This guy probably cut his teeth going up the down staircase. It's a gateway behavior. Now he's graduated to exiting through the entrance door because he knows nobody is going to call him on it.Look out for him coming at you on a divided highway."}, {"title": "Under the Influence Age", "date": "Thursday, March 28, 2013", "text": "Yesterday I stopped by my convenience store, with a name akin to Voice of the Village, to pick up a quick 44 oz. Diet Coke. I proceeded without incident to the back wall where the eight-foot-long soda fountain holds court. After refilling my refill cup, I headed up front toward the counter. That's where the incident foisted itself upon me.Carrying my precarious tall cup by the tiny bottom that fits into the car beverage holder, I was nearly bowled over by a screaming heat-seeking missile. Well. Not so much a screaming heat-seeking missile as a slightly-plump blond-haired high-school-age girl darting from behind the Sun Chip endcap. I lifted my cup, though definitely not in a toast, and shrugged a shoulder, allowing her to pass by with my innate bull-fighter reflexes. About three steps past, she turned slowly and said, \"Woooaahh.\" But without the leather jacket and coolitude of Fonzi.Dud Missile had been lurking near the front door when I entered. I paid her no nevermind. When one works with individuals that age all the live-long day, one is not inclined to greet and befriend strangers of the same ilk. Besides, Dud Missile was talking to a younger boy about some issue for which I could not have mustered less interest. I walked right through the sentence, \"Would you still like me if...\" and out from under their drama.After dropping my eighty cents into the hand of the eldest of the clerks, I turned and headed for the door. As my karma would have it, Dud Missile was back on that side of the store. Taking up space. Fiddling with her cell phone in her left hand. I put my 44 oz. Diet Coke in my left hand to protect it with the buffer zone of my body. Much like an all-conference point guard protecting the basketball from the terrier-like advances of an aggressive defender. Or like a medieval gentleman on the street protecting his lady from garbage, chamber pots, and other effluence tossed from windows above.Dud Missile wheeled around at the instant I inched around her. She jabbed that cell phone deep into the fluffy folds of flesh near my equator. I think her hand momentarily disappeared up to the elbow. I pivoted a bit to facilitate the withdrawal of her appendage from my person. \"Excuse me,\" I said. Not in the Steve Martin manner of, \"Well, excuuuuuuuuse meeeeee!\" No. Just a simple excuse me. Like that used by teachers who do not suffer bad manners gladly, but who must maintain a modicum of self-control.Dud Missile looked after me as if in slow motion. \"Oh.\" The encounter itself would have been fairly unremarkable except for one glaring anomaly. SHE REEKED OF BOOZE! Yeah. There's no way that gal was twenty-one. And I don't mean she smelled like her alcoholic mother driving to the store on a booze run had accidentally spilled Pink Panties on her. No. She smelled like when a person ingests alcohol, and the byproducts ferment their way out the mouth with each exhalation. This was at 4:00 in the afternoon. Maybe Dud Missile had been drinking Germ-X all day. Or she had inserted some kind of alcohol-soaked implement into an orifice for a quick buzz. But the fact remains that this little gal reeked of spirits.I went out the door and about my business. I don't know how she got there or who was responsible for her, or how she managed to careen around that establishment without knocking over merchandise. It may take a village to raise a child, but my voice remained silent on this one."}, {"title": "Sometimes You Feel Like a Wergle Flomp.

Today the truth was especially flauntable, because the local newspaper showed up to photograph winners in last fall's VFW Voice of Democracy Speech Contest.The Pony came prancing up the hall just before 7th hour. Usually not one to show emotion, he had a horsey grin on his face that was evident way down past the cafeteria.

Those veterans are a class act.Genius the senior, way too cooler for school than freshman Pony, barely mentioned his Second Place finish. It only came up after school because he needed a deposit slip to put his $75 in the bank. This makes the second Second Place for Genius, with First Places the other two years.

Oh, if only we could dial back the clock a few minutes as the mood strikes. How many careless acts of stupidity could be avoided? You there. It was a rhetorical question. Stop counting on your nine fingers.Saturday is bowling league for the boys. Genius usually drives himself, unless he has frittered his gas money driving willy-nilly about the county to bad movie nights and sleepovers. I normally drop off The Pony, because Hick works most Saturdays until noon. He meets us there and brings The Pony home. Don't even bother to ask why Genius can't bring him.Yesterday, Hick did not work, because he went to a meeting in Rolla for work on Friday, which supposedly does not count as real work, but like a day off. And everybody knows you don't go in to work on Saturday if you had a day off on Friday. The Pony had spent Friday night at his grandma's house, so she was taking him bowling. I needed to meet them to take The Pony's bowling locker key, which he'd forgotten to pack, and pick up a ham bone Mom had saved for me, so it didn't spoil in Hick's car during the bowling interlude. This is why Val compares managing her social calendar to mounting the invasion of Normandy.When I left home, Genius was still as his desk, plotting to take over the world. Sometimes I make it back before he even leaves. It's only a ten-minute trip to the bowling alley and to town. Genius does not suffer down time gladly. He does not arrive when the doors open at noon, but around 12:30 when the league starts. Hick was nowhere to be found, so I assumed that he would be leaving from the BARn, or the he was already running around town fleamarketing. I left the kitchen door unlocked, because I figured Genius would be there, and it's easier to get in without fishing for a key while juggling a 44 oz. Diet Coke and a ham bone.While completing my key/ham mission, Hick pulled into the bowling alley parking lot with Genius riding shotgun. I gave it no thought, and proceeded to pick up my bountiful beverage. Once home, I found that Hick had locked the kitchen door. I ferreted out my key and let myself in. I'm a kitchen door kind of gal, while Genius prefers the front entrance. Hick makes use of both portals. I had several items on my agenda, so I got right to work.First was moving laundry from the washer to the dryer. Then I rinsed the beans which had been soaking and readied their pan for the ham bone. I cut off some of the rind and set it aside as a treat for the dogs. I put away a few groceries I had picked up at Save A Lot, and ran a sink of dishwater. I ground a little black pepper into the bean pot, added a dash of minced garlic, and poured in some sweet banana pepper juice. I put the lid on, and turned it up to medium high to get it started. Slipping the dishes into the sink, I decided it was a good time to toss the ham rind out to the dogs. You can't just throw it out the kitchen door like a common hillbilly might throw it to the hounds. All three dogs lounge there on the back deck. One dog will snatch all the treats in her stacking half-lab manner, and two doggies will go the way of Old Mother Hubbard's mutt.I went out onto the deck and tossed alternating tidbits to each canine. Of course I saved the prime pieces for my sweet Juno. I threw them way over by the breezeway so she wouldn't have to snarl a warning the whole time she ate. Ann and Tank-the-Beagle minded their manners. Another successful feeding accomplished, I turned to re-enter my kitchen domain.THE DOOR WAS LOCKED!The pit of my stomach dropped ten feet below the deck to the ground. I was alone. The spare key has not been moved since the boys were tots. It's in a location not accessible to Val or Hick, but in a place only wiry snake and snail and puppydog tail boys can get it. I made a round of the wraparound porch. Front door, bedroom French doors, laundry room door...all locked up and unforgiving. I might as well have been trying to get into Fort Knox. The dogs looked at me expectantly. \"What? No more food? Why are you still here?\"I remembered that earlier they had been barking at a revving engine. I thought it was 4-wheel riders at the time. Then I heard it again. Our neighbor next door. Next door means a tenth-mile walk up my driveway, a tenth-mile walk down the gravel road, a tenth-mile walk down their driveway, and back. Val has not been training for the Olympic 800 meters. Thank goodness I was wearing town clothes, and not my stay-at-home sweatpants, ratty shirt, black socks, and red Crocs. AND I still had my New Balance shoes on, that I normally take off upon entering the house. Thank goodness the temperature was 48 degrees with no wind, not the wind-chill twenties of earlier in the week. The bean pot on medium high crossed my mind. I wasted no time in descending the porch and heading for the driveway.Then I saw them, across the field that separates us, their field that Hick set on fire one July 4th. My neighbor and a young man laying across the motor of a pickup truck. They had stopped mid-rev. \"HEY! Do you have a phone I can borrow?\"\"Sure.\" Never mind that we haven't really spoken to each other for about ten years. Only waved along the road. I started under the lone barbed wire left in the fence that makes good neighbors. \"Don't worry, she'll bring it on the 4-wheeler.\" He hollered to his wife. I went back to lean on Genius's little red Ford Ranger. She arrived with her 20-something daughter riding on the handlebars. I called Hick. No answer. I called Genius. No answer. I called The Pony. No answer. Daughter suggested having Hick paged. She knew the bowling alley number by heart. Five minutes later Hick came to the phone. He agreed to run home and unlock the door for me. I think it was the imminent threat of a house fire due to beans burning on the grill that made him do a whole lot of tryin'. The neighbors and I shot the breeze and kept our dogs separated for a while. Then they left when I assured them I was fine and Hick was on the way.Seriously. I think Hick sat down to a five-course feast and bowled a few frames himself before he hit the road. He let me in and went back to the alley where he belonged. The beans were just starting to boil. Darn Hick and his fancy lock that does not stay unlocked when the key turns it.You didn't think I was going to take the blame myself, did you?"}, {"title": "Sometimes, What's Best for the Gander is Burying His Head in the Sand", "date": "Saturday, March 23, 2013", "text": "Poor, sweet, oft-maligned Hick. He of the FAT RED INDEX FINGER. He who poots at high school band concerts. The lover of towering bowls of soup. Yes, steadfast Hick, often on the outs, is trying his best to get back into my good graces. To erase that little indiscretion of Monday night.Don't go thinking Hick made a doody on the carpet. Or disgorged a partially-digested mouse on the porch just outside the front door. And I'm pretty sure he didn't even dream of knocking over the trash can and shredding the bag and strewing its contents along the driveway. No, it was a trivial incident, and Hick's mouth that got him in a little hot water. Boiling, actually. Because he doesn't know when to turn off the burner and let things cool down. Even though another adult in this house might be screaming at him, \"Turn off the burner and let things cool down!\" Figuratively, of course. Surely you don't think I was cooking.Last evening, Hick returned from a business day-trip to Rolla. While in town filling his prescriptions for ailments other than his FAT RED INDEX FINGER, he called to see if I wanted him to bring home some Hot & Sour Soup. No thanks. I'm not currently coming down with the grippe. And besides, I'd already imbibed my 44 oz. Diet Coke for the day, a necessity to fight the Hot of the soup.Hick hiked down the basement steps bearing a gift. Another 44 oz. Diet Coke. I thanked him. Didn't even ask if he was trying to kill me by caffeine overdose. It's the thought that counts. Same as when my mom asked at the concert Thursday night if Hick could have a Three Musketeer. No. He is diabetic. That kind of treat is frowned upon. Mom persisted. \"It's ONLY a Three Musketeer. He can't have it?\" Um. No. The last time I checked, a Three Musketeer's main ingredient was SUGAR. I'm sure Mom wasn't trying to kill Hick. Like she wasn't trying to kill dumped-off puppy Juno by not feeding her for two days. But enough about my family's House of Borgia tendencies. We were talking about Hick's apologetic actions.This morning I checked my email. Saw a little something that's coming down the pike. I asked Hick if he was willing to sign a release for a story that included him and his unique method of doing things. Hick said yes. No questions asked.I'm sure that's because Hick wants me to become a bread-winning, best-selling, maligner of my better half. Because he trusts my judgment. Doesn't want to get in the way of me launching a story here and there. Yes. I'm sure that's his reason. NOT that he figures the best way to shut me up is to agree unconditionally, without making eye contact. Or the fact that he wouldn't read the directions to a gold mine if it was taped across the lenses of his glasses.Thanks, Hick. You won't be disappointed. Because I know you'll never read it."}, {"title": "A Funny Thing Happened in the Way of Decorum", "date": "Friday, March 22, 2013", "text": "Last night I attended The Pony's band concert.It was at my old high school, not far from the district where I teach and The Pony attends. No regular concert was this. It was a festival. Five schools and seven bands. Hick even pre-bowled for his league so he wouldn't miss the concert. My mom met us there, and we grabbed our seats (heh, heh, I said grabbed our seats) on the back row of the enormous field house that used to belong to a junior college. There was a bit of a draft because we were near the doors. But that was a good thing, because it blew away the stench of the bathrooms on the other side of us. Hick, always the manager of facility maintenance, mentioned that right off. \"They could have at least cleaned the bathrooms for this thing.\" Then he launched into a diatribe about their overhead lighting that was terribly outdated. I nodded like I was listening.Bands were flowing in all willy-nilly, staking out territory on the side of the huge oval behind the chairs set up for playing. I don't mean to sound judgmental, but I named every school without a one of them wearing any distinguishing uniforms. The countrified school whose girls like six-inch heels. The too-cool school whose guys favor pork-pie hats. The floor-length dress, white shirt/bow-tie school that sat calmly in their designated area without incident. And the host school whose members gamboled like great friendly puppies. Of course I knew OUR students as they entered single file, resplendent in their black slacks, white shirts, and shiny gray vests.While the concert band that drew the first slot took advantage of the pre-concert thirty minutes to warm up with scales, a curious incident occurred. Hick, Mom, and I sat spying on The Pony, trying to determine who he was sitting by. No mean feat for me, as my vision was distorted by looking through the glass basketball backboard. I was ripped from my reverie by a finger tapping on my shoulder. A girl old enough to have graduated shoved a rolled up bill of indeterminate currency into my face. \"Will you give this to Cletus Parmly?\" (Not a real name).\"No.\"\"I don't know where he is.\"\"He's right down there on the front row.\"\"I don't want to walk down there!\"\"Well, I don't want to walk down there.\"\"Oh, I don't mean right now. After.\"\"I'm not going to see him after.\"\"Never mind.\" She and an upper-elementary-age girl stood behind us for several minutes. Then they walked on around the large arena.Really? REALLY? She expected me to hoist my ample behind off the back bleacher, hike around the field house, down all those steps, across the main floor to Cletus Parmely, and hand him money? W.T.F.? Do I look like a caseworker of some sort? Do I live at the freakin' school, and devote every after-school minute to minding the student body? Am I the all-powerful queen of our district who bestows riches upon select pupils? Just because I had the kid in class one year does not mean that I am responsible for him for the rest of his life. I was not wearing a school uniform to link me with our group. We were sitting nowhere near them. I was there on unofficial business. It's not like I was sponsoring a field trip. I was sitting with my family, for crying out loud! I have no idea who this girl was, or why she wanted to give Cletus money. I did not feel the least bit guilty for refusing her request.I put my nose back in joint and settled down to hear some tunes. The second band to play was not the greatest, but they played one of my favorite selections, Shaker Dance. I was groovin' away through the first half when I noticed something was amiss. There was a strange sound not coming from the band. A kind of hissing sound. Up in the bleachers. To my right. It went on and on. I tore my eyes away from those fresh-scrubbed faces, earnestly tooting out the melody, and turned to seek the source of that infernal noise.It was my mom. She was ripping a gripper strap of Velcro on the end of her coat sleeve. Trying to get it just the right tightness. Just the right alignment. Ripping it off to start over. On both sleeves. Egads! Try to feign interest until The Pony makes his debut! I did not say anything. She's my mom. And I'm her eight-dollar daughter, or her five-cent daughter, depending on the day. I let her get it out of her system. To her credit, that little band kind of fell apart mid-Shaker. It was as if they, themselves, had lost all interest in that piece. Poor things. They were only freshmen and sophomores, the lesser of the two bands brought by their school.As if Mom's Velcro accompaniment was not bad enough, Hick had to horn in on the last act of the evening. It was nigh on nine o'clock by then. Mom had already left to go home and watch Mizzou get beat in the NCAA Tournament. I was leaning left, with my hand on the plastic bleacher, trying to realign my vertebrae. The symphonic band that capped off the evening was in full swing, filling the field house with horns and tympani. I felt the bleacher vibrate. \"Oh,\" I thought. \"Hick must have a phone call.\" We put our phones on vibrate, you see. Because we are basically a good concert audience, with the exception of Mom and her sartorial pecadillos.I looked at Hick to see if he was taking his phone out of his belt holster. Maybe he didn't notice the vibration, what with it resting against the bleacher like that to make the whole seat vibrate. Then I smelled it. A hideous odor that could only have come from one place. I glared at Hick. \"I can't believe you just did that!\"\"What?\"\"You KNOW what! I'm choking from the stench.\"\"It's them bathrooms.\" He nodded his head over his left shoulder.\"You KNOW it's not the bathrooms! You shook the ENTIRE bleacher!\"Hick grinned. Let out a contented sigh. Then choked when he inhaled the backwash of his deed.I may not have been the most cultured flower in that field house, but at least I managed to hold my flatulence in check and put off ripping sections of my outergaments until the concert was over.I got class, see?"}, {"title": "Scintillating is in the Ear of the Beholder", "date": "Thursday, March 21, 2013", "text": "Our numbers were down at the teacher lunch table today.

Finally, in an effort to steer them to a more interesting topic in the eyes of us three third wheels, I said, \"Why don't the two of you just get a show on HGTV already and be done with it?\"They laughed. And continued their little environmentally-friendly conversation. Really? REALLY? Because if I want a green lunch, I'll go to the high school cafeteria. Oh...never mind.While Sis and Bubba were expounding on the merits of solar panels and the pitfalls of hailstorms, I turned to Missus on my left. \"NOW I know how students feel in my classroom. I want to jab a sharp pencil into each ear.\"On my right, Mister, our guy with a personal story to fit every situation, got up and left. Thumped the green bean stems out of his tray, pushed it through the hot-water-hose window, and left the immediate vicinity of the cafeteria.I turned back to Mrs. \"You KNOW it's bad when Mister gets up to leave because he's bored.\""}, {"title": "The Long-Awaited Appearance", "date": "Wednesday, March 20, 2013", "text": "Did you catch it?Here now! No need to panic. I'm not referring to some exotic or hush-hush disease. I'm merely wondering if you happened to see my blog buddy, Ann (aka MommyX) on Good Morning America today. I am totally living her 15 minutes of fame vicariously. Maybe it was more like one minute of fame. But it has been long time coming. Her segment has been postponed more times than the entry deadline in a procrastinator's contest.I've been trying to get the word out so people have a chance to brush my brush with greatness. Yes, I've been pim...push...foisting Ann's appearance on GMA onto my unsuspecting readers for the past couple of weeks. I'm striving to be the Don King to Ann's Mike Tyson (let the record show that I have prohibited ear-biting, and stated off-handedly that I find facial tattoos unbecoming). I want to be the Huma Abedin to her Hillary Clinton. The Judy Ogle to her Dolly Parton. The Michael Caine to her Sandra Bullock (the most congenial Gracie Lou Freebush). Who knows, I could turn out to be a real Svengali. Or as Elaine Benes might say, Svenjolly.I set my DVR, but since my plan time at school was right after GMA's airing, I found Ann's segment online and watched it there. Who knew Ann would have a southern accent? Not me! You'd think I might have caught on that Missi-freakin-sippi is in the SOUTH by now. I'll let you in on a little secret: geography was never Val's best subject. Here's the transcript version, in case you might be distracted by the accent.The kernel that I took away from the segment was that some moms are stressed, and some moms have anxiety, and they use prescription medication to deal with it. It's not about recreational drug use and bragging about scoring illicit narcotics while you're supposed to be minding the baby. You'd think that was the focus, though, after reading the comments on the GMA site. Probably from childless folk, or narcotic addicts. I can't speak for Ann, but I seriously doubt that her blog title, \"Mommy Needs a Xanax,\" is a cry for help or an endorsement for getting high in order to deal with your own children. Perhaps some people have never heard of hyperbole. Or looked at blogging as a way of relieving stress.I'm thinking of starting a third blog myself: \"Teacher Needs a Blog.\" And a fourth: \"Wifey Needs a Blog.\" Not really. Just letting off some steam through my fingertips again.MommyX is supposed to be on Good Morning America today, WEDNESDAY, March 20, 2013. My DVRing thumb is exhausted.

It's like the juvenile delinquent of the vellum society. A ne'er-do-well who does not know his own strength. One who refuses to yield to the pull of another. I'll bet that even Ramses II complained about the audacity of perforated papyrus all the way back in ancient Egyptian times.There's a trick to making perforated paper rip like it should. After all, is there not half the amount of paper there as compared to the rest of the document? Making that perforation, in theory, half the strength of regular paper? But no. There's something wonky about those perforations. Like they've been working out, taking supplements. Like they want to kick sand in your face when you try to separate them at the detachment area.Listen up! Here's the secret. Fold over at the perforation line, then LICK along the edge you just created. Careful. No need to give your tongue a paper cut like that old lady in the commercial with the yippy white dogs who whine in commiseration when she slashes her tongue on an envelope.You'll need to act fast. Strike while the strings of saliva are still hanging between your lips and your perforated paper. Don't let that perforation dry before you try to rip it apart. Drying is not good. It makes the perforation stronger. Like you went to all the trouble to shave Samson's head, then he poured a mixture of Chia Pet paste and seeds on his noggin, and regained his strength lickety-split.You're welcome.

I'll travel the country, setting up a booth at town picnics, county fairs, regional food festivals, renaissance fairs, hillbilly shindigs, and LARP-ings. That's right. And for one thin ten-dollar bill, I will craft a knee-slappin' paragraph exaggerating your most unappealing physical features or personality traits. A literary caricature! Who could turn that down? And, because it's better to give than to receive, I will offer my services online. Think how a loved one's face will light up when you present them with an original Val literary caricature! No more need to wrack your brain for a gift idea on Boss's Day, Secretary's Day, your mother-in-law's birthday, or special anniversaries.

I will not be mocked.Val's Literary Caricatures. Framing and gift-wrapping available.I'll leave you with a sample:Gertrude was a stern, statuesque woman, upon whose head no pigeon dared to perch. Her lazy eye was the icing upon the cake of a face that only Picasso could love. Her breasts hung like plumb-bobs answering to separate sources of gravity. That they partially obscured her ample muffin-top was of no consequence to Gertrude. Her jutting buttocks swayed to and fro as she walked, eliciting cat-calls and wolf-whistles from construction workers and mild-mannered accountants alike. \"Hey, baby! I wish I had that swing on my back porch!\" Gertrude smiled inwardly, not outwardly, due in no small part to her lamprey-like teeth and large-mouth-bass jaw. Beauty is only skin deep, she thought, as she rubbed salve onto her psoriasis."}, {"title": "Sick Calling It as I See It", "date": "Sunday, March 17, 2013", "text": "Sigh. It is SO hard keeping Hick alive.First, there's that time-consuming business of telling him to breathe in, breathe out. Then I have to police his food consumption to stop his ingestion of expired items. And warn him to never, ever, run alongside his moving tractor and try to jump on again when he knocks it into gear from the ground. Friday he stayed home sick, and I insisted he make an appointment to see the doctor. Now he has a FAT RED INDEX FINGER. I've sent him off to Urgent Care, the wicked stepmother of that always-closed Convenient Care.Hick was gone three days to Florida last week while I was getting over a cold. Let the record show that he was in good health when he departed early Sunday morning. He returned Tuesday night. And woke up Wednesday morning with a cough and congestion. As much as he wants to point the blamey finger at me, I call shenanigans. Even the all-powerful Val cannot infect someone so that full-blown symptoms show up within eight hours. Especially since I was finally on the mend. My days of contagion had done passed, by cracky! I figured it was some virus he picked up in Florida, or from the airplane air.Friday morning I told wheezy Hick he didn't have to put on the sickly act for me, and that he should get himself a diagnosis and/or medicine. He did not sound good. He sounded almost bad enough for me to give him sympathy and wait on him hand and foot. However...he could only see the nurse practitioner at his doctor's office (because doctors only see well people on their six-month check-up visits, you know, and can't be bothered with worked-in sick people). That NP listened to Hick's lungs, told him there was basically nothing wrong with him, and to take TWO ibuprofens every 4-6 hours! Last time I checked, ibuprofen had been ruled not really very good for folks with high blood pressure. Flash forward to this morning, and Hick's cough had not improved. He was still running a fever.The fever business was kind of hard to confirm. First Hick complained of feeling hot. He wanted me to test his forehead. Yes, it felt hot. He got the thermometer. He said that earlier, it had showed that he was normal. I let that huge softball float right past me into the catcher's mitt. Genius had already hit one out of the park on Friday night, when Hick emailed him that something was wrong with his Facebook page. \"I can't find friends.\" I turned to look at Hick over my shoulder, and caught him putting the thermometer in his armpit. WITH THE T-SHIRT FABRIC ON EACH SIDE. Seriously? What is he, an infant? A t-shirt-wearing infant? I suppose we're lucky that Hick did not try the backdoor route. Once under his tongue, the thermometer showed about a degree of fever. Enough to be sent home from school. I made him promise to try to see the actual DOCTOR on Monday. Because he's not getting better if he has a fever five days after coming down with a cold.The FAT RED INDEX FINGER was discovered by accident on my part. Hick has arisen from twelve hours of sleep and gone straight to the couch to lay down. He was fiddling with that finger when he said, \"I think I have some kind of infection in my finger.\" I could see it from across the room. The fingertip joint had a protrusion that was bulbous and red. Like a W.C. Fields nose on Hick's finger. I asked if it started around his fingernail. Yep. There's a name for that. Paronychia. And it might have progressed to a felon. That's right! Hick may or may not be harboring a felon in his fingertip! Don't search for pictures. I warned you. That's what my mom had with her FAT RED PINKY FINGER. It took her three months to get over it, which was done by a bone-scraping surgery, not the lopping off that an osteopath recommended. Hick is not talking out of his head yet like Mom was just before her diagnosis. But with his diabetes, I'm thinking he probably needs to get right on some treatment for that infection. He reported that he had it in his other hand a couple of weeks ago. Which kind of points to an infection that was coiled in his bloodstream, ready to strike.So...Hick and Genius have gone off to Urgent Care, with plans to visit Goodwill if Urgent Care is closed. It made sense to them, anyway.************************************************************HEY!

It gives me an image of that giant hand in Jackass 3D, spring-loaded to whap unsuspecting members as they walk through a doorway. Yeah. I watched Jackass. I'm not some refined, camomile-tea-drinking, dainty maiden who sighs contentedly, gazing upon my collection of velvet paintings of big-eyed waifs while stroking one of my 37 cats. I am more of a guys' gal.

Not Paula, the wanna-be girlfriend/wife who works in the paper bag factory. In Some Kind of Wonderful, I'm Watts, the drum-playing best friend, not Amanda Jones, the stuck-up object of desire.

The future candlestick-maker went off to work on the Alaska pipeline and was never heard from again. But three out of four earn a respectable living.

A plague of bugs that have no business being where they are.Every now and then, as I sit in my blue recliner in the basement, enjoying reality shows on the big-screen TV, draped with my chartreuse, red, and yellow fleece Christmas throw...a movement catches my eye. A movement on my chestal area that is NOT the gentle rise and fall of twin peaks signifying that I am, indeed, still living. No need to hold a mirror to my mouth to check for vapor. No, the slight movement that attracts my attention is the purposeful march of a gnat/beetle hybrid the size of a pinhead. This critter is too solid to be a gnat, and too gossamerish to be a beetle. It does not jump, so it is not a flea. It does not have good reflexes, so it is not a fly. In fact, it is quite easy to grasp and crush between my immense thumb and index fingerpads.At school yesterday, I was beset by a flying insect of some type that buzzed me like I was Charlie Brown's hygienically-challenged buddy, Pigpen. I waved my arms and swatted while the students watched in awe. Let the record show that my ninja reflexes knocked that invader out of the air and onto my desk, where I smashed him flatter than a sheet of onionskin paper. Val. Not JUST a valedictorian.Last night, my recliner respite was not marred by the intrusion of a six-legged freak. All was peaceful. I was feeling a bit peckish, so I tore off a row of yellow bunny PEEPS from the open pack that rested on the coffee table in front of the couch where The Pony curves his spine while typing on his laptop. What's that? Most people don't have packs of PEEPS on their coffee table? Yeah, right. I suppose they have coffee table books about coffee tables.Not being one to do much of anything in moderation, I chomped those four bunny PEEPS before stopping to think about whether four might be a bit excessive. Oh, who are we kidding here...I didn't think twice about eating four rabbits.Then I noticed something amiss in my mouth. There was a hard particle. I gave all my teeth a quick once-over with my tongue. Nobody was missing any enamel. I stuck my finger into my gaping maw and withdrew it with the offender attached to the tip by saliva. It was a dark dot. Not moving.At first I though I had pulled a tick from my mouth! EEWWW! That's just WRONG! But it was not a tick. Upon closer inspection under my bifocals. I saw that the ejected intruder had no legs. Not four. Not six. Not eight. Good news, actually. Unless I had dissolved the legs with saliva. It IS the first step of digestion, you know. I squeezed that speck between my thumb and forefinger. It did not disintegrate. Any self-respecting bug would have smooshed under pressure. That was a good thing. The particle was not a bug.IT WAS THE EYE OF A PEEP!Somebody at the JustBorn factory is making indestructible PEEP-eyes. Not cool! PEEP-eyes should dissolve in saliva like the other parts of the PEEP. Now I'll have to turn the darn PEEPS around before eating them.

When we stop at the row of mailboxes after school, I am cautious. You never know when some Jame Gumb type of dude might be waiting to grab him a full-figured gal with the intent of eventually making her the skin he's in.The truck is an older model dark blue Dodge with a club cab with a homemade wooden door leading from the cab to the truck bed. Oh, and it's two colors of blue. Navy and cornflower. Not a factory paint job. A dude sits in the truck, and gives us the pointy-finger, thumb-up, semi-gun-hand wave as we pass by. I return it, of course. Anything else would be considered rude.Dude has a long wiry beard, graying. It's half the length of a ZZ Top beard, and not quite as pointy. His hair is unkempt, black, with gray at the temples. His eyes are blue, and his cheeks are ruddy. I point this out partially to give you a mental image, and partially as a description for the police. Dude wears a blue, white, and black plaid flannel shirt, and overalls. Today he was not in his two-blue pickup truck. He was walking down the middle of the gravel road towards us, carrying a shovel.This is probably where you should cue the psycho music.Last week I asked Hick if this truck belonged in our outer Backroads community. One of our gravel roads is an unofficial three-mile shortcut between two blacktops. It's good to keep an eye on one's surroundings. To know who's coming and going. Hick assured me that Dude does, indeed, belong here. And also left the impression that Dude is a little bit off. Which is saying something, considering how Hick looks at the world.Dude moved to the side of the road so I could pass. He had a shovel full of mud, carrying it out in front of his body like a pole vaulter carries his pole down the approach. The closest mud access point was about fifty yards up, where there's a tiny offshoot from the road that allows a four-wheeler access to a flat-rock, foot-high waterfall the width of the creek. Dude strode like a man on a mission. Who may or may not have been a pole-vaulter. I put down my window and stopped the Tahoe. Isn't that what you would have done?\"I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate what you've done here.\" Because I do. It seems that Dude is that invisible pothole fairy who has been filling the myriad of spring thaw potholes with mud. And sometimes gravel that washes out along the side of the road. We had assumed it was the old guy who threatened to shoot Hick, but now blades our driveway when the mood strikes him. Shooter has been seen cruising the gravel roads in a golf cart with a bucket. The only character we're missing is a fellow called Nub who rolls around in a red wagon.Dude stood with his shovel full of mud. He nodded. He looked embarrassed. Or afraid. \"You're welcome. Something needed to be done.\"\"Yes. It really helps. Thank you. We can tell a difference.\" The conversation seemed to have played itself out, so I rolled up the window and proceeded. Dude went about his shovel business.A Sisyphean task.

Diet Coke convenience store after school, because I deserved a treat after a particularly manic Monday. I try to limit my Diet Cokage to weekends. Really. But I threw caution to the wind and snagged one on the way home.As I waited in line, a clerk-jumper darted from behind me to the next available register. Not cool. The dude I was behind was trying to figure out how to use his credit card to pay for a 2-liter bottle of Dr. Pepper (Really? REALLY? In a CONVENIENCE store?) and gas and two different kinds of cigarettes, which should not have been that hard, you know, since the basic idea is to hand it to the freakin' clerk to scan for you if technology is not your friend.I stepped over behind Clerk Jumper. Figured she was gonna be fast, you know, what with being in such a hurry that she cut to the next line ahead of me in what could have been a fatal convenience store faux pas if I was a woman of hair-trigger temper and concealed weaponry. Do you know what Clerk Jumper bought? A 20 oz. bottle of Minute Maid pink lemonade. She asked the clerk for one of those cute little bottles of Jack Daniels stocked in a clear plastic high-rise of tiny alcoholic beverage apartments on the counter. It took her forever to come up with the cash. Like she was on a scavenger hunt in her own purse.THEN she didn't have the grace to leave, but instead asked the clerk, \"How much is ice?\" The clerk must have known what she was dealing with. She did not quota a price on bagged ice, which was the first thought in my mind. She stated that ice was thirty-eight cents a cup. Clerk Jumper tilted her head to the side like a dog in a Victrola ad. \"Thirty-eight cents? For a small cup?\" The clerk assured her that it was thirty-eight cents for ANY size cup of ice. So back on the scavenger hunt she went.Yeah. Guess what SHE was going to do as soon as she left The Voice of the Village? SHE WAS GOING TO DRINK AND DRIVE! She had her ingredients right there. I don't know why she didn't just swig out of the tiny bottle like those people on Intervention do when they're driving along being filmed and interviewed.When I got back to the car and pointed out the scenario to The Pony, I said, rhetorically, or so I thought, \"WHO drinks Jack Daniels with pink lemonade? That is just wrong!\"The Pony, apparently, has been checking out online bartending schools. \"Well, Jack Daniels is whiskey. And whiskey goes with anything. It should go fine with pink lemonade.\"\"Uh, how do YOU know? Whiskey goes with Coke. Jack and Coke. Or maybe with 7-Up. Seagrams and Seven. It does NOT go with pink lemonade! You need something like vodka for that.\" Said I, the teetotaler who DID go to college.When I got home, I consulted my BFF Google on the cocktail question. PINK LEMONADE AND WHISKEY IS REALLY A DRINK!!! And...it's called Pink Panties.Let the record show that before I left the convenience store, I made sure that Clerk Jumper and her Pink Panties left ahead of me.

I think you can manage to warm some french toast sticks in the oven according to package directions.\" Never mind the near-backfire when he used a rectangular tray instead of a pizza pan, a tray which gives a loud \"POP\" and tosses its contents toward the roof of the oven as it expands. Nor his penchant for opening the oven door and standing there in just his jeans with no shirt, basking in the warmth like an Arizona lizard on a flat rock shortly after sunrise.Genius suffers from a congenital deformity which rendered his eyes bigger than his stomach.

Anyway, the syrup is sugar-free, and it's only three little pieces of bread.\"Hick was on those french toast sticks like Kobayashi on a Nathan's Hot Dog. As he stood behind the long couch by the front door, devouring them before letting the goats out, I saw it. His pinky finger was extended like that of a refined English noblewoman sipping from a delicate China cup of Darjeeling.\"There you go again, sticking out your pinky finger! That is not a good look for you.\" Genius craned his neck from his contorted, accordioned body on the short couch to get a look, and snorted.\"Oh, you're always on me about something. I guarantee you that I've eaten in more fancier restaurants than the two of you! All over the world! And there's never been any complaints.\" Genius and I met eyes. More fancier?

While people were walking by on the other side of that little wrought-iron railing, staring?\"We did not get a response, as Hick had passed through the portal to the front porch, slamming it behind him, about halfway through the questions. Not in anger, mind you. But in desperation, because he knew that he was no match for our method of interrogation.Hick's more fancier restaurants all over the world include places like Hendersonville, North Carolina, where I'm pretty sure it's normal to lick BBQ sauce off your fingers in public, and Brazil, where they serve brontosaurus haunches on a metal pole and whittle pieces off as it is carried through the dining room like a bigger, meatier Olympic torch. Oh. And New Jersey. So let's not go filing a business license for Hick's School of More Fancier Dining Etiquette just yet.I am dreading a headline on Google News about strange slurping noises in Florida, feared to be sinkhole suckage, which turn out to be a the sound of a certain tourist gluttonously consuming oysters.While flying his extended-pinky-finger flag, of course.*************************************************************Hey, let's try again to catch my blog buddy at Mommy Needs a Xanax on Good Morning America.

The people of Walmart are revolting, the people of Save A Lot are a-bolting, and the people of the gas station chicken store are quite jolting. Happy to survive the auto impasse on the Walmart parking lot, I headed for the gas station chicken store for a 44 oz. Diet Coke. Pardon me for titling my tale out of sequence. I must have been in a state of befuddlement last evening from the strange happenings.The original plan was to snag some chicken along with the soda. One look into the glass case changed my mind. I did not intend my 44 oz. Diet Coke to wash down leathery chicken jerky. The fowl looked as though it was left from the lunch rush. Yesterday. So I stepped up to the counter to pay for my drink.A local dude had popped through the door while I was ogling the breasts and thighs. He stopped short on the other side of the register. The cashier was the short jolly one, finishing up a story for the previous customer about how she was excited about getting her first grandchild any day now. I don't hold it against her that she looked to be in her early thirties. That's how folks do things here in Backroads. Local Dude transferred his weight from boot to boot, like a toddler needing a potty break. He could not stand being outside the bullseye of attention. Jolly smiled at him. \"Are you gonna pay for that gas this time?\"\"Yeah, I'm payin'.\" Local Dude practically wriggled under his flannel shirt like an adolescent dog playing hard-to-get with a fetched stick.\"I don't see any money there.\"\"I'm using my credit card. Here. I'll just flop it out on the counter so you can get a good look at it.\"Oh, dear. That's the state of men here in Backroads. That's a pick-up line. Sure to attract females like green bottle flies to a cow patty. I was relieved that the severe head bun spinster cashier opened the other register and took my money. I felt like I needed a shower.The Pony awaited in the Tahoe. We cruised through the three stoplights and toward outer Backroadia. A maroon van whipped out of the Save A Lot road in front of us. A maroon van that somebody had paid a lot less than $1000 for. I had to slam on the brakes, wasting all that momentum I had built up after the light. Why anybody would be in such a hurry to leave Save A Lot is beyooooond me. Unless they had shoplifted some 5-for-$19.99 meats.That van took off like a bat out of Not-Heaven. Then it slowed. I caught up and had to brake again. Vanny took off. AND THE PASSENGER THREW GARBAGE OUT THE WINDOW! Seriously. Like some hillbilly James Bond with a weapon to slow me down. It looked like White Castle hamburger cartons spilling out of a white paper sack. Lucky for me, I was coasting to save gas, so it didn't hit my windshield, but was treaded by my tires.As quickly as it had appeared, Vanny vanished. Well, not so much vanished as turned left after signaling for three roads, onto a pig trail that led to what used to be a trailer, with the outer metal ripped off, showing insulation. I didn't even know anybody lived there.Maybe they don't.With this kind of excitement crammed into one evening...I might as well live in the city."}, {"title": "The People of Walmart are Revolting", "date": "Friday, March 8, 2013", "text": "There's a little more to that title. The people of Walmart are revolting, the people of Save A Lot are a-bolting, and the people of the gas station chicken store are quite jolting.Yes, this is Val, your roving reporter in Backroads. This afternoon on the Walmart parking lot, The Pony and I almost became another retail store statistic. I left The Pony inside driving like a maniac on a simulator in the game room. Yet he does not wish to get his driving permit. Go figure. I pushed my cart that I use like a walker (but without the snazzy tennis balls) up the row to the Tahoe. About six cars past me was a curious sight. I kept one eye on it while I loaded the merchandise.A small gray car was headed the wrong way up the row. A gray Ford Marquis was headed the right way, but was stopped in front of the wrong-way car. They were almost touching noses. At first I thought one needed a battery jump from the other. Cars coming down the row first stopped, then squeezed by. Tiny Car and Mr. Marquis remained. Nobody got out. Nothing was happening. The Pony joined me. He put my cart/walker in the cart return corral and hopped in. \"Let's go.\"\"No. I want to see what's going on. Look. Can you tell what they're doing?\"\"No. Someone is sitting in each car.\"\"Let's listen.\" I put a window down. A couple of women walked up the row. One in a red sweatshirt stopped on the passenger side of Tiny Car. I couldn't hear her because some dang hillbillies went by on the next row in their bigfoot truck. Red Sweatshirt went to the driver's side of Mr. Marquis. Again, I couldn't hear. The Pony feigned deafness, even though he can hear a tick crunch into a dog's butt at 500 yards. Red Sweatshirt shrugged her shoulders. Tilted both hands skyward. She came closer to join her friend.\"Mr. Marquis won't move because Tiny Car is going the wrong way. And Tiny Car refuses to move until Mr. Marquis gets out of the way. They're going to be there forever. They're almost blocking traffic. The one guy got kind of smart with me. He said he's going to call 911. I'm going to get security.\"I don't think Red Sweatshirt had a dog in this fight. But those cars WERE blocking in about 12 other vehicles that might have wanted to back out. Red Sweatshirt whistled without using her fingers. She waved her arms back and forth like a signalman on an aircraft carrier. Her friend started toward the store, doing the same thing. I assumed they were trying to get the attention of whoever was monitoring the parking lot security cameras. That is, unless that dude was kicked back in his chair licking BBQ powder off his fingers and tilting the crumbs from his bag of pork rinds into his gaping maw.A county sheriff's deputy was parked in front of the store. He got out and came up the row to talk to Red Sweatshirt. He nodded and went to Tiny Car. \"You ARE going the wrong way.\" I didn't hear the reply. Deputy went to Mr. Marquis. \"Why don't you just squeeze around there?\" Again, I couldn't hear the reply. Deputy went back to Tiny Car and emphasized the wrong-wayness. Then Mr. Marquis backed up and squeezed past, leaving Tiny Car an open aisle to cruise up the wrong way.Ain't that a kick in the butt? Just like in everything else in today's cockamamie world, the guy in the right had to yield to the guy in the wrong. Mr. Marquis was NOT happy. He pulled into a spot across the row from me. I couldn't get a good look, and The Pony refused to take a picture. He said it was a little old man wearing a cap. The passenger sat there, leaned over, unbuckled the shoulder belt, sat there...and after about five minutes, Mr. Marquis backed out and drove off. But not before a red SUV had gone barreling THE WRONG WAY up the same row at about 40 mph.I bemoan the downfall of society. Time to get crackin' on my neglected proposed handbasket factory.******************************************************To be continued..."}, {"title": "It Went South Sometime Before Sunrise", "date": "Thursday, March 7, 2013", "text": "Some days are diamonds. Some days are poop sammiches. What a day! Just when you think you are on the mend from a virusy incapacitating illness, you have a relapse. The combination of cough medicine and hot-and-sour soup Tuesday night had me thinking I was the new spokesmodel for Cheratussin Soup. I felt 100 times better. Until 1:30 this morning, when I woke up in the basement recliner with a thumping sinus headache. What my broken crown needed was a good wrapping in vinegar and brown paper. Just the thought of all that work wrapping my irregular noggin turned me off, so I went to bed to toss and turn until 5:00.The pain made me a bit discombobulated. I had some loose ends to tie up on my laptop. I ordered The Pony to fetch me an envelope to throw in my school bag so I could accomplish some personal business on my plan time. Hick had \"folded\" some of the boys jeans out of the dryer, so I had that chore to redo. My mom wanted to meet me after school to give me a candy bar. She means well. She found a new Three Musketeers bar with coconut. We made plans that rivaled the complexity of the D-Day invasion of Normandy. My routine was off kilter.The Pony and I took a different route to school because a bridge on our regular route will be demolished on Monday. We might as well bite that bullet early. When I sat down at my classroom laptop, I realized that I had left my glasses at home. I called my mom to see if she could drive all the way to my house and bring them by school. Hey! SHE'S the one who is always asking if there's anything she can do for me. I like to make her happy. I had asked her to watch for my buddy on Good Morning America, so I would know which part of my two-hour DVR to fast-forward to. You know, because she doesn't have anything else to do all day. One can only work so many Sudoku puzzles. I told Mom to wait until that show was over first. I could manage one class and my plan time with one eye tied behind my back.Dear me. I jammed the new copier while running my third-quarter tests. It happened right at the bell. I refuse to take the fall. All I did was stand there and watch. After about 50 copies, that darn Kyocera started folding the last paper and stapling it in the middle. One came out, then the jam screen came up right as the bell rang. I reported my mishap to the office and headed to class. Ten minutes in, Mom arrived with my glasses. I celebrated by sneaking an acetaminophen while the kids were working.Lunch, enhanced with the responsibility of my cafeteria duty, was a whirlwind of chicken nuggets with ranch dressing out of a giant plastic jar with a metal spout. The afternoon flew by in flurry of papers to grade and projects to evaluate. The Pony and I took off at the stroke of 3:30 for the bank and some cash. We met Mom at the park to grab that very special candy bar. She reported that she had watched all of Good Morning America without seeing my buddy.I can hardly wait to tell her that she should watch again on MONDAY, when Mommy X will be appearing, having been bumped for some breaking news, I assume. If only she could have had a toe ripped off by a roving Shih Tzu, her segment might have aired as planned.Oh, and that envelope I had big plans for? Kyocera, like a dingo, ate my baby. Okay, not my actual baby, or even the envelope. But Kyocera ate up the time I could have used to fill out and mail in a release form.Val is gonna hit the big time one of these days."}, {"title": "Val Has Connections", "date": "Wednesday, March 6, 2013", "text": "All this time, you thought Val was just a bump on a log out here in Backroads. And not a very attractive one, either, judging from the photo on her recent driver's license. A bump on a log that used to be a world-class ugly tree. Or maybe you pictured her as a little fish in a little pond. Swimming round and round, never going anywhere, bemoaning the fact that all the other fishies were just...so...fishy.I'm here to set the record straight. Val has connections. We're not talking about the guy at Voice of the Village convenience store who gives her a free 44 oz. Diet Coke every now and then. Nor about the students who call her name as she walks through the school cafeteria, fancying herself some teetotaling Norm in a nonalcoholic neighborhood bar. Nope.Val knows somebody who's going to be on television! Not a local cable-access channel, on a Community Happenings show run by middle school students. Nor a hapless citizen with a mullet and no home, having a microphone shoved into his face after his trailer whirled away in a tornado. Nope.Good Morning America, baby! Thursday. That's tomorrow as I write this. My old blog buddy, who knew me under my old alias, back when I was still wet under the waistboobs, IS GOING TO BE ON GOOD MORNING AMERICA! All because of her blog. She coined that term, you know. Waistboobs. The stretchy breasts of old ladies. We won't go into why she had a need to create that word. All I can say is: better her than me.Back in the day, we were thick as thieves. Well. We were thick. Okay. I was thick. And maybe I still am. Is that so wrong?\u00a0 She's from Mississippi. Every time I read an article about the fattest state or the state with the highest teen birth rate, I sent her a link. I know she truly appreciated my consideration. I know, because she would reply with news of some guy shooting his wife through the wall of the house while trying to start nail holes to mount a big-screen TV. Can't remember if it was a nail gun or a regular gun. That's one detail we don't really dwell on in these parts. Before, or after. Oh, and she always inquired as to whether we here in Missouri still held our title of Meth Capitol of the United States. And most often, I could reply that we did.Here she is, letting it all hang out, at Mommy Needs a Xanax. Catchy title, huh? So wrong, yet so right. Maybe you could drop in and leave her a little comment. Don't cost nothin'. She's been busy lately, what with raising two boys and all. Her impending famewhoredom came as a complete surprise.Apparently, national TV exposure is what happens when you're raising kids. Sheryl Crow might need to update that song of hers.This is not my usual daily tale of how the world conspires against me. It's an EXTRA! Details will follow this evening.Check out Good Morning America on THURSDAY. One of my old blog buddies is supposed to make an appearance. The camera crew made a house call and put her in the can.

I'm still kickin'!Last night I was miserable, despite dosing myself with the dregs of cough medicine from 2009. Its effectiveness wore off, and the night wore on. I called my mom to check in, which I do twice a day, whether she wants to talk to me or not. Makes me no nevermind if she is snugly ensconced in her recliner watching Mizzou basketball.Mom was upset at my hoarseness. And possibly with my whining. I had no witty tales of Hick's shenanigans. In fact, I was feeling so low, down-in-the-dumps, under-the-weather, sub-par, down-for-the-count that a tiny sob escaped my throat.Oh, dear. That was not the right thing to do. It was not a conscious decision. It just slipped out. Like, \"Oh, f***!\" from between the lips of a fireman at Art Hill, trying to pull a 200-lb. woman wearing a down coat out of the lake after a sledding incident. Mom began emitting tiny sobs. My own gained frequency. I told her I was going to hang up and get some rest. She said she would talk to me in the morning.This morning, my expired cough medicine was a distant dream. My head hurt, my chest hurt, my cough was back, and I misery index was rising like heat waves over a new section of blacktop fresh out of the paver on a July highway. I called Mom to check in. \"Oh, honey. I have been thinking about you all night. Is there anything I can do for you today?\" Of course that made me sob. Which made Mom sob. Which made me sob harder. That conversation did not last long.This morning I was ready. The minute my plan time rolled around, I called my doctor's office to request some proper cough medicine. That was the only time my cough was non-existent. If only I could bottle a doctor's office phone call, I could help more people go coughless than Hall's, codeine, and Robitussin.The minute school was out, Mom called. \"Are you all right? Can I pick up anything and bring it to you? Did you call the doctor?\" I explained that I would be picking up medicine on the way home, and that even though he was presently unaware, Hick would be bringing home hot & sour soup to open up my head. I did not sob. I was better than yesterday at that time.WAS. Until The Pony and I left school on the drive to the pharmacy. I hacked more than Anonymous. It felt like the top of my head was going to shoot off like the lid from an empty plastic water bottle when a freshman boy squeezes it until it explodes. My eyes bugged out like the eyes on one of those rubber eye-popper stress dolls. I needed a Depends more than a spurned astronaut traveling cross-country to confront her ex-lover's girlfriend.The pharmacy parking lot was fuller than Takeru Kobayashi after Nathan's Famous July 4 International Hot Dog Eating Contest. As I fumbled for my debit card, the whole world passed in front of my Tahoe and entered the building. People were lined up to the door. Apparently, it was a good day for making one's mother sob. My prescription had been called in, but it was not ready. The technicians were forty minutes behind. They were not about to fill something for somebody not even filling up their store. Of course my car cough abated when I walked into the pharmacy. If only I could bottle a long wait in line for cough medicine at a pharmacy, I could compete with my other product on the market, the Doctor's Office Call Elixir. (I'm also flirting with the idea of a clothing line called Togs For the Emperor).I sat down on the black faux leather couch made of chairs to wait. After about 15 minutes, my cough returned. Val had got her WHOOP back. It was all I could do not to mark that fine piece of furniture like Poppie marked Jerry's new white couch. Let's just say I did not look down when I got up. I'm hoping the little old lady that sat on my right hip was without her glasses. I took off for the counter when my name was called. My doctor had hooked me up with some Cheratussin. It doesn't hold a candle to Histinex, but it's better than four-year-old Iophen.Mom was happy to hear from me when I got home. She said I sounded better already, even though I had not yet taken a dose. Nobody sobbed. I'm looking forward to feeling better.Mom needs her rest."}, {"title": "It Was a Very Good Year", "date": "Monday, March 4, 2013", "text": "An expiration date ain't nothin' but a number.Hey!

In the same manner that Lil named her bar Coyote Ugly because Cheers was taken.You might think, with an intro such as this, that I will be expounding upon my mother's penchant for expired foodstuffs. But no. Like Rooster Cogburn, aiming to kill Lucky Ned Pepper in one minute, telling Farrell Parmalee and his brother Harold to stand clear...I've got no interest in her today.No, what we're talking about here is a failure to expectorate. I have a cough from my weekend cold, and I can't retch up that annoying liquid that tickles the back of my throat and squeezes and wheezes through my lungs.As Even Steven would have it, my plan time today was filled with grading a tall stack of work placed in my mailbox last Thursday afternoon, which I had expected to grade Friday morning. Before we had a snow day. Before this cold was even a twinkle in the eye of that close-talker who sprayed sputum in my mouth, apparently, with a surprise cough just before final bell.My lunch time was filled with duty. My after school time was filled with a lengthy First Monday faculty meeting. So I have hacked my way nearly into submission. Fruitlessly. Halls cough drops have not helped. Tomorrow I intend to call my doctor to see if he can call my pharmacy to see if they can whip up an elixir to halt my hacking. I am not optimistic. If I try to make an appointment, I will have suffered needlessly and no longer need relief by the time my scheduled audience with the doc arrives. Don't even get me started on that Inconvenient Care place.Tonight I was left to my own devices. I am loathe to breeze into Walmart and grab a boxed bottle off the shelf, because cough medicine ingredients clash with high blood pressure like a polka dot shirt with madras shorts. In the nooks and crannies of my kitchen cabinets, I discovered an old bottle of my prescription cough medicine from 2009. That's right. 2009. There was not so much cough medicine in it anymore as there was a tiny blob of gooey stuff that looked like the center of a Fruit Gushers candy piece. I added a bit of water and swirled it. Let it sit on the counter five minutes. Poured out a teaspoon in the plastic shot glass measuring cup.EUREKA! It worked for about two hours. Mostly.

Oh, who are we kidding here? This is why Val can't have THINGS.The kitchen is my domain. According to Hick, it's where I merely heat things in the microwave, or warm them in the oven. Still, that's more than he does. In fact, Hick does not even know where kitchen stuff goes. That's why he can't put anything away. He doesn't have a diagram like the lid of a Whitman Sampler.If my kitchen was a convenience store, that cushy mat the cashiers stand on would be at the corner of Sink and Counter. That's where I do my food prep, the 'L' with the sink at my right hand, and the stove at my left. That's where the wooden paper plate holder sits, and the salt and pepper grinders. The glass plate cabinet is directly above. The silverware drawer just below. Because this is my control center, I feel safe in leaving my red Solo cup there within arm's reach. I use it every morning to take my medicine. I use it to stay hydrated while glowing over a hot stove. No need to throw it away every day. It's only used for water.This morning, my red Solo cup was gone. I don't know about you, but to me, this smacked of an act of provocation. Thank goodness I do not yet have nuclear capabilities. You might as well stick your tongue out at me. Kick sand in my face. Flip me the bird from the passing lane. Show me the sole of your shoe. Not cool.Not being an I'm okay/you're okay, everyone's a winner, unicorn-and-rainbow-loving flower child hippie, I set out to apprehend the culprit. Not so much bent on revenge as on assuring that this reckless disregard for my personal possessions did not rear its disrespectful head again. Especially after struggling so hard to put an end to the confiscation of my tube of hair conditioner that comes with L'Oreal, the clandestine use of my pink plastic disposable razor, and the unauthorized removal of bites of food right off my plate.In my house, there are really only two suspects. The one who is the food snatcher, with his very own red Solo cup that sits on the cutting block, and the one who takes everything else. The interrogation of Hick was not suitable practice for my dream career of high-profile prosecuting attorney. More like catching a toddler with his hand in the cookie jar and melted chocolate chip residue around his mouth.Did you take my red Solo cup?Red Solo cup?Yes.What red Solo cup?You know what I'm talking about.I drank out of a red Solo cup last night.Where did you get it?What do you mean, 'Where did I get it?'Did you take it off the counter?I don't know.Well, that cup I leave there to drink out of every morning is gone.Huh.You know you took it.Okay, so I took a cup off the counter. There's always a stack there.No. There's ONE cup. The one I drink out of. Get your own out of the pack in the pantry.I don't know why you're making a big deal.That was MY cup. You were just too lazy to walk three steps and get your own.Believe me, I don't want to drink out of your cup, the way you hack and sputter.That's funny. Because you took my cup. Even though I've had this cold since Friday.I swear, I'm going to get my own stuff and keep it in the BARn.You do that.See, it's the principle of the matter. What if I took the plastic cup Hick keeps by the bathroom sink to take HIS medicine every morning?

Hick does not like the \"juice\" in soup. That's why he builds a bowl like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. I told him it was done enough. But that we were having it for supper, and also tomorrow. He ate it anyway.What Hick does not seem to understand is that even though all the ingredients are in the pot, the final taste is still percolating. The flavors have to marry.

PETA is strangely silent on this one.Tadpoles can see through eyes on their tails. Now don't go jumping to rash conclusions. No matter what you read in the headlines, these tadpoles are not mutants. Nor are they exhibiting evidence of a homozygous recessive genotype. They did not sprout eyes on their tails like Aunt Edna sprouts whiskers on her chin. These tail-eyes were put there by scientists. Yep. They are frankentadpole peepers.Again, don't go all weepy over the article's talk of \"donor\" tadpoles who gave their eyes for this experiment. They were not offered releases to sign.

Perhaps you didn't read at all, but tried to rent the movie and ended up at a stranger's apartment elbowing their teenage daughter away from the end of the white couch where you could reach your nuts while sipping grape juice and hushing the family discussion. If that was the case, you might have missed the detail that scientists removed the eyes of normal tadpoles, and grafted eye tissue onto the tails of the test subjects.But wait! There's more here than meets the eye! (Heh, heh! See what I did there? I said, \"meets the EYE\" in a story about EYES!) Scientists REMOVED the normal eyes of the tail-eye tadpoles! Took out perfectly good eyes, made their test subjects blind, and stuck eye tissue on their tails to see if they could see! And in some convoluted manner involving red light and blue light and, oh yes, electric shock...about nineteen percent of their test subject blinded tadpoles avoided that red light shocking area.Don't go thinking that a bunch of frogs will be released with eyes on their butts. Tadpoles absorb their tails as food. So they will be eating those eyes like Andrew Zimmern, Anthony Bourdain, and Amazing Race contestants experimenting with global cuisine.PETA? No tadpole love?

Who do you think you're foolin'? as Paul Simon might have sung if he was being tailgated by a large white SUV while chugging up a 35-degree incline on twisting two-lane blacktop. So close was that large white SUV that I could not even see the brights of its eyes. THATCLOSE! Perhaps I've mentioned a time or two hundred how much I detest tailgaters. But even vengeful Val would not want that large white SUV to receive its comeuppance in the form of a head-on crash. And neither is that the story.Our convoy, rolling through the evening, had just crossed back into a new 30 mph law inside the outer city limits of Backroads. We bumped over the railroad tracks. Coasted down the hill beside the lovely lake that most municipalities would call a pond, and then it happened! THE STORY!On the jogging path, blocking a lithe shirtless shorts dude and a plugging sweatpantsed weightloser about fifty paces behind, was A GORILLA!!! Right there on the blacktop jogging path around the lake. Right beside the parking lot. Just across the street from the nursing home that used to be the hospital where I was born. A GORILLA! And it WAVED to me!It was not a standard black gorilla with shiny hands and face. It was a brown gorilla. The shade of brown that looks really bad in a suit on a TV meteorologist. Kind of a gingerbread hue. I would love to have taken a blurry picture with my phone camera, but there was that messy business of the large white SUV crawling up my back hatch. My resident captive photographer, The Pony, was away at an academic team meet. So I was unable to bring you, in all its glory, the brown furry gorilla that waved to me from the jogging path of the lake that Backroads built.You know how a picture is worth a thousand words.

He said, 'May I have a cookie, please?'\" The correct response is: \"Imagine that!\" See how it works? You don't call them out for being a liar, and you don't pretend to believe their claims. \"Imagine that.\" A companion phrase for the \"breathtaking\" ugly baby.Now where was I...Oh, yes. Rats! I mean Genius. He came in yesterday and flung open my mini fridge. Let's just say that he met the fate of Old Mother Hubbard's mutt. \"There's no water!\"\"There's water. In the package under the table.\"\"It's not cold!\"\"No. That's why we have the mini fridge.\" Genius stalked towards the door. \"And you think, perhaps, that the next time you look, it will be full of cold water? Just like that?\" He kept going. I swear. He's like me, watching An Officer and a Gentleman for the tenth time, still holding out hope that Sid will be okay. That Zach and Paula will open the door of his motel room at The Tides, and find him laid back on top of the bedspread in his skivvies, watching TV and swigging from his fifth of whiskey, waiting for that diamond engagement ring to pass through his digestive system.This morning when I returned to my room after parking lot duty, the mini fridge was stocked with water.

He scored a leftover chicken sandwich from yesterday's lunch, a chicken strip, and a vat of honey mustard. The salad was met with a turned-up nose. I casually asked if one of his friends was playing baseball this year. They were starting practice today, a coincidence that has nothing to do with the full moon. Genius, a robot boy, not a baseballer, said that he did not know. I asked about another. \"I'm not sure, but he stabbed me with a fork at lunch today.\"Oh, he lobbed that one in there like a slow-pitch softball for me to hit out of the kitchen. I SO wanted to say, \"Stuck a fork in you? You're DONE!\" A clever baseball taunt, you know. But I refrained. Not because I am above such clever repartee.

Check your appetite at the door.Thank goodness we don't give them white plastic knives. The gash Genius was sporting from the fork was deep enough. Since he wasn't raising a ruckus, I imagine that his forking did not materialize out of thin air. Perhaps he attempted to snag a tasty morsel off the tray of another. He does it regularly around here. But we are not armed with white plastic forks. Nor do we live by the state penitentiary code.Maybe I need to check Genius's room for a poster of Rita Hayworth.

Middle, as in right smack dab in the.Being a curious sort, this got my attention last December when we had our, ahem, first unforecast eight inches of snow. Oh, I thought. They're keeping people from becoming impaled by icicles falling from the roof overhang. That's how my mind works, you see. It jumps to the goriest, most human-carnage-resulting conclusion. Next, I supposed that maybe the management did not want people slipping on ice that may form on the parking lot. Which was silly, because they did not block off the sidewalk, or even scatter chunks of salt over the lot by the gas pumps.Because I'm a curious sort, I noticed that the widely-corrugated green metal roofs of the prison outbuildings that I pass twice every day harbor great sheets of compacted snow that sit complacently all the live-long day, until that instant they decide to slide over the edge in a spectacular show of exploding white crystal smithereens.Aha! I thought. Voice of the Village does not want people bombarded with stealthy ice-pancakes from their metal roof. Still. They left the sidewalk unblockaded.

Not people.\"The intention was revealed when I paid for my precious elixir. Yes, paid.

Yeah. That one. This still reminds me of it.

They just couldn't predict any time or numbers until about...um...I don't know...THE NIGHT BEFORE THE SLEET HIT THE ATMOSPHERE. They kept hemming and hawing about it being a southern storm, which is SO unpredictable here in Missouri. What they're being paid for if not for predicting weather, I don't know.The day OF the storm's arrival, the event we had been waiting for some TEN LOOOOONG DAYS, I started hearing that my county was going to get the worst of the freezing rain. Puh-leeze! All that time, this tiny tidbit had been glossed over. We would be getting more sleet and freezing rain than snow, sure. But what those TV meteorologists had accidentally failed to mention was that this could be a slight problem for us folks here in Backroads. Not in the slippery-road-problem kind of way. In the ICEPOCALYPSE of '06 kind of way.I listened to those ice-cryers, proclaiming that utility crews from out-of-state were traveling here to await our depowering, and thought of the monster-shouter in The Stand. Until I remembered that he was kind of right. Here it was, sleet already falling, and freezing rain coming, and me not knowing how to hook up the generator and keep from frying all of our electrical circuits. Wasn't THAT a fine how-do-you-do? Lucky for me, Genius was lolling around like Axl on The Middle. Luckier for me, we had power until 7:38 p.m. Lucky for you, I had posted to my blogs a bit early due to my SNOW DAY.It really wasn't that bad. I had just settled into my basement recliner with 236 Pounds of Class Vice President. I was on the final few pounds. The part where author Jason Mulgrew dons a fur cape to give his vice-presidential candidate speech. And the power went out. I grabbed my green and red and white fleece blanket, The Pony fetched me one of his book lights, we lit two hazelnut cream candles, and settled in for a bit of a wait.After thirty minutes, Hick and Genius went to the garage to fire up the generator. Gennie was having none of it. Nothing like having your vital machinery in working condition, ready to assume the load when needed. It took them another thirty minutes to make Gennie power up. Then The Pony and I were able to watch King of the Nerds, and become one step closer to seeing who prevailed in the house called Nerdvana, to eventually ascend\u00a0 the Throne of Games.Luckier for us, the power returned after only ninety minutes.

At the time of this writing, Friday morning, I am out of my element. Val is a nighttime blogger. To create a tale of intrigue so early in the day is not in her DNA. Nothing has happened yet! Sure, some of you might consider this to be a blog about nothing anyway. But I assure you, it is no internet-screen version of Seinfeld.Since nobody and no thing has conspired yet to derail Val from her mission to take over the world, you will be treated to yesterday's news. PEOPLE AT A LOS ANGELES HOTEL DRANK CORPSE WATER! It's true! Here's a link. I saw a smidgeon of the story on the news, and I just had to know more. My BFF Google and I convened to get to the bottom of this secretive cistern.I foresee a miasma of emotional-suffering lawsuits stomping in on giant fat feet. Seriously. People sue because their coffee is hot. Do you really think they will drink corpse water lying down? I, myself, do not. Think so, that is. Not drink corpse water lying down. But I don't do that, either. Or sitting up. I'm pretty sure that drinking water in which a corpse has been decomposing for two weeks is one of the things that is kind of unhealthy for you.Hick says it isn't. \"They treat that water with chemicals! It's safe to drink. And anyway, that's probably toilet water. Not drinking water.\"Well. The last time he was in charge of the rooftop water system at a Los Angeles hotel was...let's see...I believe it was...NEVER! So I said to him, \"Oh, so it's okay for corpses to be floating willy-nilly in the water supply tanks of hotels in California?\" Maybe that explains how some people check out but never leave.I'm no water quality technician, but I would bet a 44 oz. Diet Coke that people are not supposed to drink corpse water. I reminded Hick that in Cold Mountain, Jude Law came upon Giovanni Ribisi trying to move a dead bloated cow out of the creek, because it was upstream from his homestead, and was ruining his water. In fact, Jude loaned him his newfound friend, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and his stolen two-man saw, and they set about hewing that deceased bovine in half to remove its carcass from the creek. That's a lot of work to go to if it's perfectly all right to drink corpse water. And do you know what Hick said to me?\"VAL! That was a COW!\"Like decaying cow microbes are unhealthy, and decaying people microbes are no big deal.Besides Hick's frivolous attitude towards corpse water, here's another thing I find disturbing. Guests at the hotel reported to reporters that the water they had been drinking for EIGHT DAYS had a funny taste, but since they were from Britain, they simply assumed that's the way it was over here. Like we are a nation of corpse-water drinkers! Oh, and furthermore, the water that came out of the shower head was black for the first few seconds. But they did not complain! Heavens to Betsy! Are the British THAT polite and unassuming and reluctant to make waves?I read on another source that this couple was paying $65 per night for their room. I don't know about you, but I, like Vern in Stand By Me expecting more for his seven cents than hamburger and Coke, would have expected more for my $65 than corpse water and a black shower.Val has expensive tastes and unrealistic expectations, it seems."}, {"title": "Anatomy of Why Val Needs a Lobotomy", "date": "Thursday, February 21, 2013", "text": "A much-desired, long-awaited snow day fell into my lap last night. I promptly celebrated by falling asleep in my basement recliner after The Pony and I watched Survivor.This morning, the trusty meteorologists on all channels kindly informed me that I was safe until 9:00 a.m. At that point, Backroads would be beset by sleet with a little snow mixed in. Because, you know, our area was only getting mostly sleet and maybe some freezing rain and high winds in the afternoon. With this forecast fresh in my mind, I went about my business.By 7:45, I was ready to head to town for some chili fixin's and a sausage biscuit for Genius. And, you see, I figured I might as well pop in to pick up a 44 oz. Diet Coke for myself. What with being in town and all. Okay. As you might surmise, most people rush out for milk and bread. Val rushes out for a 44 oz. Diet Coke.The trip to town was uneventful. Temperature hovering at 24. Roads clear. Sky overcast. The main county road, marked with a letter, had been spritzed with saline and beet juice for two days. Our blacktop county road had received no such tender loving care. Had I slid off into a ditch, I could have laid there like Ray Brower knocked out of his Keds picking blueberries along Back Harlow Road until Gordie, Chris, Teddy and Vern showed up to discover the body.I pulled into Save A Lot on schedule and grabbed my items. At the checkout, a worker moaned, \"Here it comes.\" She was not delivering a baby. The sleet sluiced down outside the front wall of windows. I paid and boxed. My mom called to see if I was home yet. Nope. I carted and loaded and took off across the road for my precious. My 44 oz. Diet Coke. I had to hold onto the Tahoe's body to walk on the sidewalk and parking lot.I thought about going directly home. If the sausage biscuit had been for The Pony, I would have had no qualms. But it was for Genius, a surly morning person who would make me rue the day I returned without his sausage biscuit and hash rounds. The Pony had rejected such a fine repast three times before I left. I decided that since I was there anyway, I would have one as well. They had two for $1.87. Far be it from Val to pass up a bargain. I ordered Genius's hash rounds, and threw in one of those for me, too. I went inside to order because the drive-thru was backed up. It did not save me any time. Ten minutes later, I was gingerly traipsing through the bushes alongside Hardee's, not wanting to chance their concrete ramp down to the parking lot. I grabbed the Tahoe's trusty hood and stepped down. Lucky for me, ice had not yet built up on the running board.On the way out of town, I spied a county road truck. He wasn't spraying. Just driving my way. And because Val is a hometown celebrity, that big orange dump truck with a plow on the front and special tubing on the back set his gravel-sprinkling lever as he turned onto that unloved county road. I had an escort in front of me dropping black pebbles like rose petals in front of a blushing bride. Black gravel. The lesser, cinnamon babka of highway department road treatments. I tried to take a picture through the windshield, but the camera had disappeared from my phone. Good thing a meteor didn't streak across the sky in front of me.As I turned onto our gravel road, my little Pony called to see if I was okay. He was worried that I had been gone too long. Besides, his grandma had called badgering him about my whereabouts. He came out to help me unload my purchases. As I set the Hardee's bag on the counter, I said, \"Would you like a sausage biscuit and hash rounds?\"\"Yeah! That sounds good. But where are Genius's?\"\"Um. There is one of each for him in that bag.\"Darn! All that way, all that stress, all that salivating over how good those ketchup-dipped hash rounds were going to taste with my crisp 44 oz. Diet Coke...all for naught. You can be sure I did not offer him my soda.Here was the concrete behind the garage when I arrived home at 8:50 a.m.Juno had to get into the act. (She looks a bit misshapen because Genius used his wide-angle lens). Juno's a curious one. Or just happy to be released from her unfortunate BARn incarceration. This was the beginning of our storm. So far, we still have power, though my mom's was knocked out for forty-five minutes.School has just been cancelled for Friday. I hope I can make it to town tomorrow for a 44 oz.

Anyway, Juno is now a year old, healthy as a horse, a long-haired, black, border collie/lab mix, all legs and human hazel eyes and feathery tail.Oh, you didn't know that Juno was missing? NEITHER DID WE! She's an outside pet. Most mornings she comes a-runnin' to lick my hand goodbye as I leave for school. In the evenings, she darts under the garage door to eat a mouthful of cat food before I get out of the car. We have a regular lovefest on the porch under the breezeway. This afternoon, Juno was not there. Neither were the other two dogs, so I thought they must be out running around.This evening, The Pony put off collecting the eggs when we got home. For the last couple of months, it has been THE EGG. But the hens have started laying again. Hick found a whole chicken-butt-load of them in the dry leaves under the pool steps just outside the basement door. So we're back up to eight eggs a day. At 5:30, I told The Pony to get out there and get the eggs before it was dark. His proposal to use a flashlight later fell on unsympathetic ears. He can only garner so much sympathy for that atrocious haircut that I made him get.The Pony returned to gloat. \"It's a good thing I waited to get the eggs. One minute earlier, and we wouldn't have had that last one. It was still hot. I scared the chicken right off it. She jumped up, and there it was. She ran screaming all the way from the chicken pen to the back yard.\" Normally, Juno goes with The Pony to fetch the eggs. Whether for companionship, or in hopes that he will trip on a root and bounce one out of his red-and-green Easter basket, I'm not sure. The Pony did not mention Juno.Hick got home late, ate supper, and commanded The Pony to accompany him to feed the goats, check on the three new kids, and work on a board for his science project in the BARn. The Pony returned to the house around 7:00. \"JUNO WAS LOCKED IN THE BARn! She's been there since the last time Dad was in there. That was yesterday afternoon around 4:00. Now that I think of it, she didn't come out of her house this morning when I threw that meat out on the back porch. She's been there all day! And last night!\"\"Oh, no! Is she all right? Can she still bark? Or did she make herself hoarse trying to get somebody to let her out?\"\"She seems okay to me. In fact, she's really, really happy, bouncing around and playful.\"That sounds like sunny Juno on an ordinary day. I'm glad she was not traumatized. I suppose the trade-off for a night in a heated BARn is a very late breakfast at 7:00 p.m. Poor, poor Juno. She's a social butterfly with people and other animals. Plus, her plastic chicken with only one foot was laying in the yard all alone. She plays with it every day. It's a good thing The Pony is pushing his project to the wire. Juno might not have been found for another day or two. Usually we notice when an animal is missing. Hick has locked up other pets in the BARn. That's the first place we look. This holiday weekend had us all discombobulated.After a tasty repast of dry dogfood, and a bowl of fresh water, Juno was happily reunited with her canine companions.

Well, hair like his father had when he HAD hair. It is a mixed blessing, much like that of Theodore \"Beaver\" Cleaver, who inherited the freckle-prone Bronson skin from his mother. And thankfully not her penchant for pearls. When The Pony's hair gets longer than a couple of inches, it waves. It kinks. It curls like a springy perm that Mike Brady paid good money for before flying off to Hawaii for his boys to find that bad-luck Tiki idol in a cave. Because The Pony showers at night, his hair is stretched and bedraggled by morning. The remedy is a quick scrunching of fingers dripping with water. That tightens it back into regular curls. The Pony's mane had grown so long that it came down past his eyes when unkinked. I decreed that he was getting it cut over this three-day weekend.Hold on for a minute while I dab my eyes with my dainty, initial-embroidered hanky. Pass me the smelling salts. I am beside myself.

Nor Janice herself, since she would no doubt be cutting my hair at a future date. \"Whoa! It sure is short!\"As we went out the door, I said, \"How come you didn't tell her it was getting too short?\"\"I couldn't SEE it! I have to take my glasses off, remember? So I couldn't see in the mirror how short it was. Until I put on my glasses when it was done. And it's not even straight!\"\"You're right. At least there are no holes in the back, like they did to Genius twice. The back looks good.. It will grow out. That's what my mom always told me when I got a bad haircut. Don't be surprised if kids say something about it at school.\"\"I know. If they do, I can show them your driver's license picture, and then I won't feel so bad.\""}, {"title": "Backroads, We Have a Problem", "date": "Saturday, February 16, 2013", "text": "For those of you who might think all Hick does on a weekend is lounge around in his La-Z-Boy, I present the following true tale from earlier today.We were on our way to pick up The Pony from his grandma's house to take him out for his birthday dinner. Hick was piloting my Tahoe. He took several phone calls from work, because the world cannot turn on its axis without the careful guidance of Hick. I must have complained about his lack of attention to the road during these calls. I know that's hard to believe. I think my exact words were: \"Why don't you just pull over until you're done talking on the phone?\" Hick saw no need for that. After all, his sweaving was not that much different than when he devotes his full attention to driving.\"You must have nine lives. I think you're on number seven right now.\"\"Make that number eight. You almost lost me this afternoon.\"\"How's that?\"\"I was almost done fixing the tire on my tractor. I needed it to roll forward just a little bit. I didn't want to climb up, so I stood beside it and pushed in the clutch. It started rolling, and my hand slipped off. That popped the clutch, and the tractor took off by itself. I fell down. I rolled out of the way so it didn't run over me.\"\"You mean the tractor was driving itself?\"\"Yeah. I would have let it go to see where it ended up, but it was heading for the BARn. I jumped up and ran alongside. Then I thought, 'This is stupid.' I knew I couldn't get on. So I ran along and reached in and hit the kill switch.\"\"You are a big dumb ape.\"\"Yeah. That was not a very smart thing to do.\"Acknowledging the problem is the first step."}, {"title": "Neither a Lender Nor an Enabler Be", "date": "Friday, February 15, 2013", "text": "I don't like to loan pencils.It really has nothing to do with germophobia. I would never lend one of my three main writing utensils to a student. But I have others I could lend. It would not break my bank to hand out a pencil every hour, and not get it back. No. It would not hurt me. It would hurt the borrower. I am a big believer in responsibility. My policy is that if I find a pencil or pen, I put it on my desk as a loaner. If somebody asks, I will let him use it for that class period. But once it's gone, it's gone. No loaning until I find another. And if somebody claims it, that's one less pencil available for loaning. This keeps the borrowing to a minimum.Don't go thinking Mrs. Thevictorian is a selfish pencil-hoarder. I have given kids the pencil out of my hand on certain occasions. Like when the asker is not a habitual borrower, and mentions how his pencil broke, or ran out of lead, and he is now faced with a pencil-less day that will be stressful to one so conscientious in completing and turning in assignments.In the past, there was a year of pencil giveaway season in my classroom. I used to hand out writing sticks willy-nilly, hoping to help those who could not afford pencils, or those who didn't have a way to town to buy pencils, or those who had their pencils stolen, or who left them in their pants pocket during the wash, or ran out of lead, or...the excuses were endless. I grew tired of finding my special pencils broken in half, on the floor, lost by the next day, left on the student desk, out in the hall, and hearing how they were stupid wooden pencils--didn't I have any mechanical pencils? Like the one in my hand?It seems like the same kid always needs a pencil. Every day. I can't imagine asking for one seven hours a day. Day after day. Funny how these kids have a dollar for a giant sugar-free beverage from the machines at lunch. But can't spare a quarter for a pencil from the teacher who sells them in the cafeteria every morning during the free-for-all breakfastfest.Give a student a pencil, and he writes for an hour. Make him be responsible for his own pencil, and he writes for life. This elder needs help from the village in raising responsible students.My last two loaners disappeared when I had a substitute last week. Our subs are notorious for loaning pencils. I laid the two loaners on the desk, along with two pens for the sub to use. Better than having them rifle through the desk in search of implements to toss out like candy from a Labor Day Parade float. The pens remained. The pencils were gone.Now I have no loaners. But in one class, with my older kids, I loaned two of my personal pencils yesterday:Not the yellow Office Max. He is there to lend perspective. Two pencil-beggars of advanced years and experience were given the choice of using the behemoth or the sprite. As Kim Darby told Glen Campbell in the original True Grit, regarding his character stealing a kiss or spanking her, \"I assure you, one would be as unpleasant as the other.\" They did not like scribbling with these outliers. A message was sent. And received. The freshmen would try to borrow these on purpose, just to gain the spotlight. One has to know the psychological profile of one's clientele.Mrs. Val Thevictorian.

I seem to have made an unfortunate global faux pas.I blame the blinding headache that beset me around 2:30 a.m. I think it must have something to do with the atmosphere, seeing as how I had duty out in the parking lot yesterday morning at 34 degrees, and again after school at 56 degrees. It's sinus in nature, hits me in the evening, and is sometimes abated by a scalding shower. However, there is no scalding shower in my classroom. I must make do with the tools I have available. More on that later. Let's get back to my global faux pas.After lunch, a colleague passed me as I stood at my post monitoring the hallway. \"What's that illness where all your joints and muscles ache, and you don't have any energy? I want to tell my class, and I can't think of the name.\"\"Oh! Wait a minute! I just had it. Now it slipped away. I KNOW what you're talking about. I'll think of it in a minute. I'll call you.\"She went on down the hall a few steps. Snagged a paraprofessional and interrogated her. \"I think it starts with an 'F'. What IS it?\"Suddenly, the diagnosis came rushing back to me. I hollered down the hall, \"That's it! Fibromalaysia!\"\"Oh, yeah! Fibromyalgia! Thanks!\"I did not correct her. No need to emphasize the fact that I had just given an entire nation a medical disorder that is sometimes declared imaginary. That headache was really working on me. All I wanted was some peace and quiet. Not an easy wish to fulfill inside a secondary school. I thought I had achieved my P and Q during my plan time second hour. A belief which lasted approximately two minutes.All I wanted was to be alone with my vibrator. HEY! Not THAT kind of vibrator. The flat, egg-shaped black plastic vibrator I ripped out of an airplane neck massage bean-baggy collar thingy. Blue. I hold it against my forehead and the headache goes away. Unfortunately, like standing in a scalding shower, that act is not conducive to learning. So I have to do it on the sly. In stolen moments, like my plan time.So I whipped it out and went to town. Ah...the absence of pain. If I had a hind leg, I would have been twitching it like a blissful hound having his belly scratched. It was great while it lasted. Then I heard footsteps in the hall. I did not want to be caught in flagrante delicto with my vibrator. So I turned it off and set it beside my desktop laptop. As soon as that student went walking by, I picked it up again. I almost gave myself vibrator elbow in the span of fifty minutes.Never had there been as much hall traffic as there was today. It was like a million-youth-march. The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade exhibits less foot traffic than passed by my classroom. Kids flitting and giggling. Adults clomping like Anheuser-Busch Clydesdales down cobblestone streets. Adults and students raiding the storage closet right next door. Uninvited visitors. I would not have been surprised if contestants from the Amazing Race had popped in to ask directions. I blame Valentine's Day. Our halls are normally bereft of students during the golden fifty minutes.\"But Val,\" you ask, \"why didn't you simply close your door?\" Because there is no such thing anymore as simply closing one's door. All doors must be locked. They can be propped open, mind you, but the lock must be engaged so that a simple slam renders the room impenetrable. That means the 147 times somebody comes a-knockin', the student closest to the door gets to walkin' and lets them in. On my plan time, I am not jumping up and dashing diagonally across the far reaches of my room to let in somebody tap tap tapping at my chamber door. Today, for instance, I had a phone call, followed by a student seeking missing work, an office worker with a request for absentee homework, a textbook returned by another office worker that was not even in my number segment, and a drop-in paraprofessional asking to see my driver's license photo.No wonder my head hurt."}, {"title": "The Neighbor Creeps in to Sharp Little Cat Feet", "date": "Wednesday, February 13, 2013", "text": "Now that dogs have had their day, I must devote a few moments to cats. Because that's how much time my cats devote to me.I was never much of a cat person. My mom couldn't stand them, so there was slim chance of having one as a pet. Mom said cats were sneaky. She hated the way the neighbors' cats, John, Paulie, George, and Ringo, wound around her ankles when she walked all the way across the back yard to scrape her leftovers into the ditch. Town in Backroads is just a closer figuration of hillbillies.During early adulthood, I lived in an apartment complex where a neighbor in the next building had a black devil cat. That's what the rest of us called him. She called him Fred. Crazy Cat Lady was crazy about her cat. He could do no wrong. When she invited our little crew over to socialize, Fred was the one who went crazy. You know how a cat can be sprawled on the floor one minute, or laying on the fish tank cover dipping a paw lazily into the water, then suddenly decide he needs to be somewhere else? Yeah. That's what Fred would do. Dash around that apartment like gravity had no hold on him. I swear he ran along the walls like a speed cyclist, round and round, and then upstairs to his bedroom with a little POOF of air announcing his exit. You'd think he'd been dosed with some of the painkiller Tom gave to Aunt Polly's cat, Peter.Crazy Cat Lady booked a cruise to Greece that summer. The only problem was Fred. She asked me to look in on him once a day. To make sure he had food and water, dump his litter box, and put her newspaper and mail on the kitchen table. I agreed. It's not like teachers have anything to do in the summer. Except take a cruise to Greece.The first couple days of cat-sitting were uneventful. I grabbed the mail, picked up the paper, and let myself in with CCL's key. Fred was nowhere to be seen. I could tell he was living by the absence of food, and the presence of poop. I did my duties. Sprinkled some food for the fish. Made sure the cover was folded back down on the fish tank.Around the third day, Fred grew bold. He sat halfway down the townhouse steps, watching. It was eerie. I tried to make small talk with him. But you know how dismissive cats can be. I might as well have been talking to myself.The next evening, all not-heaven broke loose. The minute I stepped inside the front door, Fred tore down those steps and clawed my bare leg, then turned on a dime like a well-trained, expensive barrel-racing steed, and ascended the carpeted stairs with nary a snagging of claws. Wasn't THAT a fine how-do-you-do! And me providing the food which provided him the energy to attack, making it harder for me to walk into the kitchen and provide his food. We were almost an O. Henry story.The next night I was armed. One-armed. I tucked the mail under my left armpit, and clutched the newspaper in my right hand. I stepped inside. Down those stairs Fred shot like one of those tubular fireworks that scream across the ground and explode under your lawn chair. He scraped more skin from my shin. Darted away before the blood began to flow, as I took a sweeping swing with the daily news. There was no joy in Apartmentville. Mighty Val had struck out.That was our pattern for the rest of the week. I took to slipping on a pair of sweatpants over my shorts before the feeding mission. And wore shoes instead of THONGS (there, I said it, the proper name for rubber footwear that has nothing to do with tramp stamps and strippers and pr0n stars). I never did connect with that black devil cat. He always got in a swipe.When CCL returned, and asked, in the middle of a lovefest of purring and petting (her and Fred, of course, not her and me, just because I mentioned pr0n don't take liberties with my ambiguity), \"How did you and Fred get along?\"\"Just fine.\" I eyed Fred. Fred eyed me. We both pretended our little week together never happened. CCL kept inviting our gang over for socials, where she would sit on the floor and demonstrate how she could put her foot behind her head, and Hick, the future Mr. Val, would watch with his eyes bugged out, and our buddy the insurance adjuster would put Scotch tape on two of Fred's feet to see him walk like an Egyptian.Ouzo might have had something to do with it."}, {"title": "That Hypothesis Has Already Been Proven Correct", "date": "Tuesday, February 12, 2013", "text": "Today I read an article that said dogs are more likely to steal food if they think they are not being watched by people. My reaction? \"And...?\"Don't dog people already know that? Without need of a scientific study?Every evening I open the garage door when I'm halfway down the driveway. My feisty dog Juno runs down off the porch, wagging her feathery black tail, wiggling with pleasure, and shoots under that door as soon as there is enough room for her wiry body. I make my 90-degree turn and pull in, and there's Juno bent over the roasting pan of dry cat food. As soon as I put the Tahoe in PARK, Juno reappears on the porch. I can see her through the glass of the garage people-door.Butter wouldn't melt in that dog's mouth. She acts all glad to see me, like she has not got cat food on her breath. If I close the big metal door as soon as I pull in, trapping Juno in the garage with me, she stands beside the cat food pan. \"See? It's me! Your loving doggie! Happy to see you back home again! What...THIS? It seems the felines have eaten their fill. I'm just investigating. You might want to feed them less. Because there's FOOD IN THIS PAN! I'm just telling you. It's not like I'm eating it, you see. That's CAT food. And I'm a dog. Not a cat. I'm just standing here. I seem to be trapped inside this structure. I really want to be out there on the porch. I ran in momentarily to greet you, you see. And I simply noticed this--what do you call it--roasting pan with cat food inside. Don't that just beat all? I mean, imagine, four cats, and still food left here. That's wasteful. You'll never catch me and my dog brother and sister letting food go to waste like that! If you need to dispose of it, well, I will volunteer to clean it up. Just let me know.\"Uh huh. Juno knows I can't jump out and scold her until the car is stopped. She straightens up at that instant.

Uh huh. It was like when, in one of my favorite old movies, Dante's Peak, the motel clerk tells Pierce Brosnan that the town has just been named Second Best Place to Live in the United States, Population Under 20,000. Yep. That fictional town and I are both mighty proud. But I'm not gonna blow my top and lay to rest several minor characters.What have I done, you might ask, to deserve this award? GOOD QUESTION! It seems that I am flinging out cheer willy-nilly over the innernets. C'mon! You KNOW the first person you think of when you hear the word SUNSHINE is Val Thevictorian. That's me. Sweetness and light. Kittens and unicorns. Cupcakes. With sprinkles! I'm a regular Pollyanna. Nary a cross word shall issue from my fingertips. What's that? I'm a big fat liar? Hm...have you been looking at my recent driver's license photo?Lucky for me this award requires me to answer a few questions. What better subject to talk about than ME? And the format surely beats going down to the station and being hooked up to that polygraph machine.FAVORITE COLOR: Green. Any shade. Neon, forest, emerald, with envy...FAVORITE ANIMAL: Dog. Sorry, my cats. You are too aloof.FAVORITE NUMBER: 4. For no particular reason. And in spite of the fact that two of my relatives used to work at State Hospital Number Four. Also referred to, by children, and not very politely, as The Loony Bin.FAVORITE DRINK: A 44 OZ. DIET COKE!FACEBOOK or TWITTER? What's that? I don't partake of such employment-terminating sites.MY PASSIONS: my boys, my husband's quirky ways, Seinfeld trivia, and pretending that I'm a writer.GIVING or GETTING PRESENTS: Giving. I pick out good stuff. I don't like pretending to like things given to me in good faith. It's the thought that counts, and contrary to popular opinion, I do not like to hurt feelings.FAVORITE DAY: Friday. The whole weekend stretches ahead, full of promise.FAVORITE FLOWER: Lilacs. That's what I miss most from my $17,000 house. We tried to dig up shoots and grow them here, but one died the first year, and the other took seven years to bloom. Then the goats ate all the low branches.There you have it. What makes Val so sunshiny. Drink a cup of that every day, and you might turn out just like me! I think I might market it as Vitamin V. Can't be any crazier than selling people water.Now, for the moment we've all been waiting for. Who shall receive this award next?

If they already have a Sunshine Award, they can darn well accept another. Even if they don't want to respond to the interrogation. I'm sure each of them has a man cave where they shelve their awards, and polish them and talk to them like this clip of cartoon penguin surfer Tank, in Surf's Up, talking about his trophies. Okay.

I'm sure it will look better when you get your license in the mail.\" A regular Pollyanna is she. Never has a bad word to say about anyone.

The topknot of hair you made into a curl and tied up with a ribbon? The innocent toddler the camera loved? THAT'S NOT ME ANYMORE!\" I thrust the picture under her nose.\"OH! Val...\" She recoiled.

That's like a sick day, except you know ahead of time that you're going to be off, and you feel just fine. In the beginning.I knew I had to renew my driver's license by Monday. Not that I received a notice from the MO DOR. I just knew. Because last time, it was a six-year renewal. And the new expiration date is one's birthday. So...I knew I had to get in there and do the deed. Having worked for a state agency, and having waited in many a line at various license offices, I knew better than to try and run in Thursday or Friday after school. That would only give me an hour to complete my business. So I took advantage of a personal day, meant to be used for business that can't be completed outside of school hours.The Pony still needed hauling to school. What's that? Why couldn't he simply ride in with his brother, Genius? Surely you jest. Have you not been paying attention all this time? One is more likely to receive an invitation to the wedding of Oil and Water than to see my two boys enjoy each other's company on a trip to school. I arose like any other workday, herded The Pony into the Tahoe, and sped over hill and dale to deliver him to school. He thanked me.Since the license office didn't open until 9:00, I had ninety minutes to burn. I sped back home and TurboTaxed my federal and state returns. At the stroke of 10:00, my mom called to remind me not to forget to renew my license. She filled me in on all the minutia about the office. Preparing me. It's been six years, you see. The license office is no longer in the mini mall behind the church. Nor is it beside the old bowling alley, in the storefront that used to house the video store. Nope. It is now behind the dead-mouse-smelling post office, between the daycare and the house with a big sign for the Space Museum in its yard. I pass it all the time. But Mom wanted to make sure I knew where to park, and that I must first stop at the window on the left to get a number unless the girl wasn't busy, and if I got a number, to sit in the waiting room on the right. And to be prepared for a vision test. She looks out for me, my mom.By 10:15 I was on the road again. The weather was cloudy but calm, temps in the forties. I was having a good hair day. All signs pointed to a quick license renewal, and the rest of the day stretched ahead for the pushing of the SEND button on taxes, and getting Genius's college board IDOC stuff ready to mail off. Val plans. State employees laugh.I parked without incident. Only one other customer was inside. Standing right in front of the door. I could barely get in. But that did not bother me. After all, I had my old license ready, and a head of good hair ready for a picture. The dude was on his cell phone. He abruptly stepped back to let me in, and tell the girl behind the wall-hole that he would be right back, just as soon as he ran across town to get it. I'm assumed he was talking about a document, not a quickie.I stepped up to the window, and the License Warden, all of 23 years old, asked my business. \"I'm just here to renew my driver's license.\" She reached out her hand. I passed her my old license. She looked at me. Had the nerve to ask for my birth certificate. Dear me! Do I not look born? Do I look younger than 16? I think not. \"You're kidding. I have to go all the way back home and look for my birth certificate?\" She nodded. AND handed me a two-sided paper of necessary documents.\"Here is what you need.\"\"It would have been nice to know that before I came in. I never got a notice. How silly of me not to remember that from six years ago when I last renewed.\"\"Oh, this is a new process. Didn't you see it on the news? We need your social security number--\"\"I have the card. But I don't know about my birth certificate.\"\"It has to be an official birth certificate with an embossed seal. And you'll need proof of residence. Here. Here's what you'll need.\" She circled various items on that two-sided handout and pushed it at me, with my old license. I sped out of the parking lot to seek evidence of my existence. Almost daring the police to stop me and ask for my license. I called Mom to complain.\"It would have been nice if you'd warned me I'd need my birth certificate.\"\"Oh. I didn't need mine. I might have yours here. Do you want me to look for it?\"\"I guess you can. I'll look at home. Those things are harder to keep track of than scissors and pencil sharpeners at our house.\" I rushed home. Let the record show that Val does not live just down the street from the license office. That she can't hop on the subway, the EL, the T, a cable car, a crosstown bus, a double-decker bus, take a Yellow Cab, a Hansom Cab, or a rickshaw. She lives off the grid of back roads, up a gravel road. That she had already traveled twice before 11:00 a.m.The elusive birth certificate lay on my office file cabinet, just under the birth certificate of Genius, fresh from his licensing in December. Silly me. I thought he needed it because he was getting his license after having a permit. I read and re-read the list of documentation. I needed...+ my old license-check+ my social security number-check+ proof of residence dated within the last 60 days-an electric bill stub should do+ notarized marriage license OR social security card showing current name-card will do it+ BUT...in place of all this, INS papers will doBeing a thinking kind of woman, I anticipated License Warden giving me a hard time with that electric bill. It was in Hick's name, of course. The way most married couples have their bills sent. So I grabbed my last check stub showing MY name with the address. Off I went back to town for the third time before noon.Now the wind was whipping up. I called Mom to tell her I found a birth certificate obtained from the county health department at a cost of $15 in 2007. \"I found your birth certificate in my safe. I think it's from the hospital. It says 'Certificate of Live Birth' at the top.\"\"Mom. That's not good enough. I'm not running for political office. I'M TRYING TO RENEW A MISSOURI DRIVER'S LICENSE! Does it have an embossed seal from the state? No? It won't work. I''m starting to think I might have to move out of the country, then get papers from the INS, THEN come back and renew my license.\"Business at the license office was picking up like the wind that swirled my good hair to bad. License Warden was not at her desk. She was interrogating a dude at the eye test/picture desk. Another clerk called my number. 25. A lady on my heels had grabbed 26. An old man in overalls came in and plopped down in the chair closest to the eye test/picture desk. Another lady snatched #27. The clerk asked for my paperwork. Pawed through it.

Not one to disappoint my vast readership, I present this account of what happens when septuagenarians ignore their body's cry for help. And take in relatives to provide shelter in a storm.During the big ice storm of ought-six, our power vanished overnight. I had no desire to sit in my all-electric mansion with no heat, nolight, no means of cooking, no water, no flushing, and no way to entertain twoboys. Hick selflessly volunteered to call in late to work so hecould drive us to my mom\u2019s house twelve miles away, our storm oasis, a tinyisland of power surrounded by an ocean of blackout.Genius, then eleven,and The Pony, eight, took over Grandma\u2019s TV and computer as soon as we arrived.I read the paper and chatted with her while she bustled about gathering snacksfor the kids. The Pony was the first to notice something amiss. \u201cGrandma, I don\u2019t like it when you\u2019re like this. You lookdepressed.\u201d Mom set down a bowl of macaroni. She sucked in her breath, andgrimaced.\u201cAre you all right?\u201d\u201cOh, I just bumped my finger. It\u2019s been alittle sore.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d\u201cI had ahangnail that was bothering me. I tried to fix it with a needle, but it\u2019s notgetting better.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t go poking at it with a needle!\u201d\u201cI dipped the needle in alcohol, and usedcotton balls soaked in Bactine. It only hurts when I hit it on something.\u201d\u201cLet me see.\u201d\u201cDo you think I should put some antibioticointment on it?\u201dThat pinkyfinger was bright red, and swelled up big as a bratwurst. \u201cBoys, get your shoeson. We\u2019re going to the emergency room.\u201dThe emergencyroom only had two patients. That tends to happen when the roads are coated with ice. The nurse took one look at that fat red pinkyfinger and hustled Mom back to an exam room. During her ninety-minute stay,various staff popped into the waiting room to ask if we were with somebody.\u201cWe\u2019re with the finger.\u201d They knew exactly what I meant. The doctor soakedMom\u2019s finger for twenty minutes, wrapped it in gauze, told her she hadparonychia, gave her a penicillin pill, and told her to fill the prescriptionwhen the pharmacy opened the next day. [WARNING: DO NOT search for pictures of paronychia!]Back at home after her soaking,Mom seemed in better spirits. The boys and I hoped she was on the mend. We\u2019rethe kind of freeloaders who need to be waited on hand, pinky finger, and foot. Hick went back to protect the homestead, armed with a kerosene heater and flashlight. We had eighty-five homes without electricity on our line, and no estimated repair time. It would turn out to be five days. Five days of the fat red pinky finger. The boys and I stayed with Mom. Hick worked by day, came to sit a spell with us in the evening, and then went back to sleep at home in the cold. I picked up Mom's antibiotics and made sure she took them on schedule.Genius organizeda team Scrabble game. He picked the teams and the names. His own team with The Pony and Grandma was called Geniuses. Funny how he named the team of Hickand me the Morons. I could not stand for that, and renamed us theGenius-Slapping Morons. To which The Pony declared we were the Dum-DumGenius-Slapping Morons. Whatever. We spanked them. Not literally. Not that I\u2019maverse to spanking kids when they need it. No, what I mean is that we beatthem. Not literally. What I\u2019m trying to say is that the score was 316 to 142,in favor of the Dum-Dum Genius-Slapping Morons. Our last play of forty-twopoints, adding the word \u201cwove\u201d in the lower left corner of the board, on thetriple word score square, demoralized the competition. The Geniuses forfeitedwith only twelve letters left in the game. Woo Hoo! I beat an 8-year-old, an11-year-old, and a little old lady with a systemic staph infection! Oh. I had apartner. Hick was the letter-drawer. He done good. I think Mommight might have been ready for me to go home. In a power struggle over whogot the long couch for a nap, she seemed to side with Genius. She gave him thebest pillows and the soft blanket. I got one square pillow made of Berbercarpet\u2019s pillow-cover cousin, who was good at soaking up drool but left arelief map of the moon on my cheek, and a brown horse blanket. That thing couldhave been used as industrial-grade sandpaper. And Mom left my right foot outevery time I asked her to cover me again.The Pony walkedaround like a hunchbacked septuagenarian, clutching his sacroiliac with hisright hand. According to him, \u201cGrandma\u2019s couch has a bar in it that hurts myback.\u201d He spent four nights on the hide-a-bed, while Genius madethe couch cushions into a bed on the floor. I took a bed upstairs. We were fast wearing out our welcome. Luckily the power was restored the night before school started up again. Hick bought a generator and two fake fireplaces to make sure that predicament would not befall us again.The fat redpinky finger defied antibiotic intervention. Mom\u2019s doctor referred her to aninfection specialist after four rounds of antibiotics. The infection specialistreferred her to an osteopathic orthopedic surgeon, who gave her a week to make a decisionon his recommendation of amputation. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t guess I would miss it thatmuch. I don\u2019t use it for anything but cross-stitch.\u201dI put a stop tothat talk and took Mom to a different orthopedic specialist, who performedsurgery to scrape the bone. She still has her pinky-finger, though it\u2019s a bitstiff.We\u2019ve had moreice storms, less severe, and weathered the power outages with our new generatorand fake fireplaces.

Auto after auto passed by, at\u00a0 slower speeds that normal. A helicopter flitted past, from east to west. It was not THIS helicopter.No, THAT helicopter was of average proportions, such as many a helicopter seen over these parts in the past. A sightseeing voyage, perhaps. Or a news copter.

They greet and treat and send you to a real hospital. That's what they did with my gallstones and The Pony's broken elbow. Sure, they stitched up Genius's eyebrow, and soaked my mom's FAT RED PINKY FINGER in a solution prior to bandaging and referring her to an osteopath who wanted to lop it off.I can't imagine anybody in need of an air ambulance going there, when fifteen minutes north or south could take them to a trauma center.

Hey! Those laws are made for people who don't know how to control their large SUVs. Besides, Genius said that his teacher told him on a robot team trip that police have a saying, \"Nine, you're fine, ten, you're mine.\" Where she got her insider information, I don't know. It was so kind of her to enlighten beginning drivers on this corollary to the rules of the road.The road from whence the patrol car nearly came flying has a twenty mph speed limit. I know that for a fact, Jack. I cut through there to go from town to the bowling alley. It runs past an elementary school. And those signs do NOT say when school is in session and children are present. Twenty mph is the speed limit all the livelong day. 24/7/365.The policeman and I glanced at each other. Furitively.

I did not help people find jobs. That was the other side of the office. I was an enforcer of sorts. I started as a an E.S. Deputy, and rose through the ranks to the lofty job of E.S. Technician. Deputies filed the claims, and inspected the work search logs of claimants every four weeks. Face to face. Pressed for time. Moved the masses. Technicians were the judge, jury, and wanna-be executioners. They worked mainly by phone, with a headset, calling employers and claimants to get both sides of the story on separation details. Occasionally a claimant would come in to give a statement in person.A technician had a finite number of cases to adjudicate. Once that was done, he could be pulled to assist with the deputy duties, or catch up the filing, or help with the mail. I loved that job. If you had any kind of people-reading skills at all, it was a fascinating process. Sometimes it was obvious that both claimant and employer were lying through their teeth. So you\u00a0 were swayed to the side of the lesser liar. We had a protocol for denials and the assessment of penalty weeks. The key thing to remember was that every decision had to be made based on the last incident that caused the separation. Didn't matter if Bob had been late nineteen times that month, and was told that he'd be fired the next time he was late. If he had a flat tire and called in per company policy to report his impending lateness, there were no grounds for dismissal in our book. No penalty.My cubemate was a classy lady we'll call \"Grace.\" We sat at the two front cubicles of the double row of technicians. Like pilots. Engineers. Facing the cabooses of the deputies and their supervisor. The public did not come back to our section unless scheduled to give a statement. We were pretty much left to our own devices. The technicians scheduled for a two-hour call block were not to receive incoming calls unless asked for by name. When not making calls to gather information, we made decisions and wrote out our reasoning. It was common to look over the rose-colored fabric partition made through the sweat of the brows of Missouri Department of Corrections inmates and ask for input from a cubemate on borderline cases.I was a relative newbie, and Grace was a seasoned veteran. She was a throwback to more genteel times. She wore died-to-match pumps. Tasteful wigs. A skirt and sweater set every day. Pastel. She was quite prim and proper, always polite, looked up to by the rest of us. I was quite comfortable under her wing, learning the ropes.Throughout the day, a technician would catch bits of one-sided conversations, some mundane, some titillating, some a doggone cryin' shame. But we were fair to a fault. Always followed our guidelines, even though one might mutter, upon disconnecting, \"No wonder that guy got fired.\" Or, \"That story won't fly.\" Or, \"They were just looking for an excuse to get rid of him.\"Three months into the job, I felt like I knew Grace. I saw her swivel her chair to face me across the shoulder-high partition. She was just wrapping up a claimant statement call. She thanked the person on the other end of the line for the information. Unplugged her headset wire from the phone. And said clearly, though not loudly, \"XXXX XXXXXX.\" Sorry. I can't bring myself to type her actual words. Let's just say that it was an expression describing one who might, for a share of the purse, ride upon the back of a beast found in arid regions of the eastern hemisphere, known for its ability to store water in a protuberance found upon its dorsal side.My mouth dropped open. Grace's blue eyes met my hazel. She smiled, and turned to write up her statement.It was as if The Baby Jesus had been kidnapped from a church nativity scene, taken on a bar tour of the neighborhood, and returned talking like Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog.Grace had not been kidnapped.Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of women?

Nor a hazmat suit with a respirator like those worn by the government guys experimenting on Stu Redman in The Stand. Gone are the days when a kid could snort out forty gallons of blood, have the teacher tilt his head back, pinch his nose while he gargled on life fluid, then be pronounced healed, and spend the rest of the day wearing a stiff brownish-red shirt. I remember skinning a hole right through my royal blue polyester pants with the little stitchy thing down the front of both legs (worn under a dress, of course), and wearing those clammy things all afternoon, with a gaping hole in my knee covered by a square of soggy scarlet gauze and hospital tape.

Three little bucks stood staring at me. One a four-pointer. The other two with just a single little antler on each topside of their head. I didn't know bucks hung out together, but my students assure me that once rut is over, they do.The turkeys showed up this evening, around 4:30, as we were coming down Mailbox Hill. I have to watch it, because one side is still icy from Sunday morning. As I topped the hill, foot poised over the brake pedal, I saw birds walking across the road. Like those animated ones at the beginning of The Partridge Family. These were no partridges. Not colorful. Nary a Keith, Laurie, Danny, Chris, Tracy, or Shirley in the bunch.I started to count them. Not like sheep. I was already yawning and ready for a nap. Every time I tell Hick that I saw turkeys, he asks how many. One, two, three...they kept coming out of the woods on the left, crossing to the right. Too bad the possums weren't there to take notes. I was a bit apprehensive that a BigFoot-type truck would run up on me. But still, I sat in a stationary Tahoe and counted turkeys. The Pony joined in. As soon as one would run into the right-hand woods, another would emerge from the left. They were like short feathered clowns without a car. No end in sight. It was like the Beatles crossing Abbey Road. If there were twenty-nine Beatles. And if some of them could fly.Oh, they fly, you know. Contrary to WKRP folklore. I can't speak for tame fancy eatin' turkeys. Or for those dropped from a plane. But the wild turkeys surely do fly from the ground up into the trees. The are not graceful downy ballerinas. But they achieve lift-off. They sound like a squadron of helicopters when they do it. Some of the latter road turkeys took off into the wild gray yonder. More flew out of the left-hand trees and across the road. Kind of like Duck Hunt. But without a Nintendo red shooter. It's a good thing they stopped at twenty-nine, because The Pony and I were approaching our finger/toe counting limit.Hick the unofficial Doomsday Prepper would be pleased to hear of my experiences. He does not actively prep like the Nat Geo show people. He just talks about it a couple times a month. \"I got this little bucket at the auction. Do you know why it's so skinny? So it can go down the well pipe. If we lose all electricity and can't get gas for the generator, WE will have water. People coming out of the city trying to live here won't have clean water. They'll have to boil their water.\" See what I mean? Left to my own devices, I would probably poke together a whole bunch of plastic straws and stick them down in the well pipe like a butterfly tongue sipping nectar from a flower. Which is actually not a tongue at all, but a specialized proboscis. Just humor me and play along. We don't have to be sciency specific all the time.Meat on the hoof and wing means that it will take longer for Hick to resort to eating his precious chickens and goats. Of course, he does not like to hear that if we are in the midst of doomsday survival, the lack of medicine will do us in before we starve to death. He's probably on a quest to find folk medicine remedy recipes in an old armoire at an auction or flea market. And maybe another box of auction meat, which he WILL buy this time.Actually, it would take quite a long time for either of us to starve to death."}, {"title": "Let Your Imagination Run Wild", "date": "Monday, January 14, 2013", "text": "Pardon this look on my face.

Every now and then, some odd antics occur without explanation. The most recent incident was last Sunday.I called The Pony to my dark basement lair, my office, located at the front corner of the basement. The Pony lounges on the couch at the other end, watching the big-screen TV and fiddling about on his laptop. I wanted him to put my baggie of knee ice back in the mini-fridge under the stairs. He does this for me on a regular basis. Once a day. But Sunday evening, something was different.\"Okay. Now THAT'S creepy.\"\"What do you mean?\" The Pony had crossed three steps from my office doorway to my desk to grab the knee ice. Or as he proclaimed it, knee water. Ice melts, you see. When he took those three steps back to the doorway, he made that \"creepy\" proclamation.\"That door was not open when I came in here.\" The Pony was not talking about my office door. It's only a portal. No hinges. No door. I wanted it that way. \"It was closed, and now it's open.\"\"What are you talking about?\"\"The bottom door on that gun cabinet by the refrigerator. It's standing open. Again. It was open earlier when I came downstairs. I noticed when Dad asked me to bring him up a soda. I closed it. Now it's open again. That's not right.\"The gun case holds two long guns of a type which I do not know. I'm not a gun enthusiast. It's a wooden case, with a glass door that opens to take out the guns. Hick says those are his \"show\" guns. The ones he's okay with somebody taking if they break in, rather than look for the \"good\" guns. He's a bit of a collector. I've only known him to go target-practicing a number of times less than I can count on my fingers. Thumbs excluded. The gun case is against the front basement wall, under the stairs, across from the mini-fridge. It has two small wooden doors at the bottom. Inside is a pair of winter gloves. That's it.The small doors were what The Pony was talking about. I would logically infer that he must have bumped the door while getting a soda or knee ice out of the mini-fridge. Except that the cabinet door was open BEFORE he got the soda. And AFTER he came directly from couch to office to grab the knee ice and put it back a couple hours after he got it out. It's a short cut, you see, to pass under the stairs, between mini-fridge and gun cabinet. A short cut The Pony takes multiple times per day, coming to my office when summoned, or going to and from the NASCAR bathroom next to me.In all the years of homestead living, this is the first time that cabinet has let a door hang open. The Pony has been fetching items from the mini-fridge, and cutting through that gap, hundreds of times. I can't explain it. But The Pony is spooked. Wednesday night, we were looking for a lost item. One we thought The Pony had misplaced. Or put down somewhere and forgotten.. \"I'd go look in that cabinet, but I don't want to. It's dark over there.\"I'm not sure what to make of it. Since last Sunday, the cabinet has remained closed."}, {"title": "Val Can Get it for You Wholesale", "date": "Friday, January 11, 2013", "text": "I'm kicking around a new invention.

And I assure you, my invention is NOT a cart. You'll find out farther down the page. Hang onto the cliff a bit longer, you instant-gratification junkies! Patience is a virtue, and winding through one of Val's meandering posts is next to Mother-Teresa-ness.This morning in the shower, I had the most scathingly brilliant idea for a submission. I'd like to think that inspiration flows into me through some other-worldly conduit. But I have a feeling it's just the thyroid medication kicking in. The idea was about how teachers support each other, have an unwritten code, how colleagues have your back, will give up their prep hour to fill in for you if an emergency arises. UNTIL IT COMES TO SUPPLIES. Not-Heaven hath no fury like a teacher filched from. They are on guard 24/7 for acts of pilferage.So invested was I in this story of truth that I smiled at The Pony all the way to school, he in the seat behind me, oblivious to my Cheshire lippage. Listened with one ear to the plot of the new science fiction book he is writing (already has a prologue and two chapters), I gleefully invented new words in my head, set the scene, shouted the kicker in caps in my mind.By seventh hour, I had forgotten the whole thing. All day long, I had been harboring my secret, not consciously thinking about it, just enjoying that warm glow knowing that after school and a bank trip and shopping for the week and grabbing a 44 oz. Diet Coke and carrying in and putting away all that stuff, I could put my true story on screen. Yet there I was, five minutes before the bell, drawing a blank. Oh, the inanity! I almost panicked. The whole circuitous trip home, I tried to backtrack. Get the feel. The mood. The ambiance of the tale. For some reason, my mom kept popping into my head. But I didn't think it was about her. She's not all that funny. I took myself back to the location. The kicker. AND IT HIT ME! I had my story back.My new invention is for those who never get their story back. C'mon. Who has a little spiral notebook with them in the shower? Not me. It's out in the living room on the end table. A world away from the shower. Woe is the showering writer struck by a bolt of inspiration. I sensed a need. So I invented...drum roll please...NOTES ON A ROPE!Oh, yeah! A product whose time has come.

For some time, I chose to consume my high fat high salt fast food from other establishments, using the poultry place only for 44 oz. Diet Cokes. Imagine my surprise when I heeded the pull of my fowl master, and returned for a meaty crunchy treat on my husband's bowling night.Where once there were normal sized sections of bird, I found a thigh bigger than a breast. I know, Miz Manners, how shocking that must be. I, myself, thought, \"Mary! That's akin to getting your beans above your frank! What a freak of nature that fryer must have been, tottering around on giant T. rex legs, flapping withered gnat wings to keep her balance. No breast development in that pullet. The tiny white meat morsel was like a mini gummi hamburger. Made to be cute. Not filling.\"Miz Manners, the thigh was nothing to write home about. But rather, something to write YOU about. I remember during childhood, when my mother cut up a frying chicken for supper. And when my grandma caught a chicken in the sideyard, and spun it over her head by the neck until it popped loose and ran around for a minute. The thighs served on my girlhood plate were like chicken on a stick. Lots of meat, arranged with a bone through the middle. This mutant thigh from the gas station had a tiny bit of meat on one side of a two-inch bone. But the rest of it was fried skin over bone! Can you believe it? That thigh was a T shape. Only the top of the T was longer than the stem. And it was BACK. A BACK bone. A back is not a thigh.I've a good mind to slaughter one of my yard chickens, drive it to town, and show the gas station cooks what a real breast and thigh look like. On the chicken, too. Is it not bad enough that Little Debbie Cherry Cordial Cakes are now the size of silver dollars? You remember the silver dollar, don't you Miz Manners? Every Christmas, these very special Little Debbies have been downsized. Before long, they will assume the size of Starlight Mints.What do you think, Miz Manners? Should I show those gas house fry cooks the real deal? Or should I suffer in silence? Or market my leftover bones as a new kind of Rubik's Cube, to see if gifted children can reconstruct a chicken from that framework?Signed,Breastless in Backroads*******************************************************************Dear Breastless,Don't do anything rash, my dear. Teeny tiny gas station chicken pieces are better than NO gas station chicken pieces. People love tiny things. Just look at the new cars on the lots. Those itty bitty electric gadgets that can go a whole thirty miles on an overnight charge. People are eating those things up. People who don't drive more than thirty miles, and who can afford the hit to their electric bill, and who don't care about the environment, what with all the charging eating up more resources than a regular gasoline engine. Where do they think the electricity comes from, huh? The electricity fairy? The power plants that operate on coal or nuclear power must work harder to fill the hungry grid. But I digress.By no means would Miz Manners advise showing the convenience store workers your breast and thigh. That just is not done in polite society. Nor should you voice a complaint. Next time you might find a neck and a butt in your take-away bag. And some unappetizing chicken pieces as well. Suffer in silence, sister. Consider it a reducing plan. Recycle. I hear that giants are always on the lookout for a bone bargain to help defray the costs of their homemade bread business.\u00a0I hope you will accept the fact that this is not one of those things you can change. And next time, please clean your fingers of grease, either by soap or saliva, before you write to Miz Manners.Sincerely,\u00a0Backroads Miz Manners"}, {"title": "The Very Special Episode", "date": "Wednesday, January 9, 2013", "text": "Sometimes, the sitcom of my life takes a more serious turn. An event occurs that needs its own very special episode. A whole hour. During sweeps week. And as a show of good faith, I am willing to send the writers home. You heard me. No need for Rob Petrie, Sally Rogers, and Buddy Sorrell to burn the midnight oil. Some shows write themselves.The Pony and I made a trip to the bank after school. We stopped at a local park to meet up with my mom and exchange a tin of pictures from 1984, a Zyrtec coupon, a bag of mini Twix and Butterfingers, and a baggie containing Christmas meat and a hambone...for last week's National Enquirer and Globe. Yeah. I think we got the long end of THAT stick. We proceeded to the dead-mouse-smelling post office to pick up two packages, one being special socks for Hick, the other an otter box. That's a belt holder for his phone. We're not raising otters now, nor do we have them in our master bathroom vent fan/light fixture. We scurried on home, up our muddy gravel road whose gravel had disappeared like granny panties in a septuagenarian's buttcrack, over the area where ice had still been packed as recently as this morning. An altogether uneventful trip.Genius arrived a scant ten minutes after we did. The Pony was out gathering THE EGG that we get each day, rain or shine, twenty-nine out of thirty chickens being slovenly layabouts who can't be bothered to propagate. He had just stepped in the front door with his little basket when Genius blurted, \"So I guess you guys saw the arm?\" I'm getting a bit hard of hearing, it seems, or kids these days talk in some kind of code. But The Pony gave him a crazy look, too. So I figured I must have really heard that sentence. It's not like the talk at the teacher lunch table of how a kid kept singing \"Elvira,\" but thought it was called \"Hellfire.\"Genius grew impatient with our slack-jawed countenances. He whipped out his phone and shoved it under my nose. Even without my bifocals, I could understand what he was getting at.That's an arm. A road arm. On the road in front of our property. It was not there when The Pony and I went by, but Genius stopped for a picture a scant ten minutes later. The first thing I asked was, \"Oh, no! Are you the throwing-arm killer?\" Not such a nice thing for a mother to ask, I suppose. But I was 99 % sure that Genius was not. Though I was relieved when he denied it. The second thing I asked was, \"Is it REAL?\"\"Um...let's see. NO! It's got a bar code on it.\"The third thing I asked was, \"Where did you say that is?\"\"On the road in front of our new land. Not up on the hill. Right beside us.\"The fourth thing I asked was, \"Will you send me the picture?\" It's not every day that a theme for a very special episode of the sitcom of your life falls right onto your road.\"AGH! Do I HAVE to? Why can't The Pony go get you a picture on your phone? It will take forever to send it. He can run over there and get it.\"\"WHY? I just came in from gathering THE EGG! I don't want to go back out in the mud.\"\"Yeah. Why should he run all the way over there? If it was you, you'd jump in your truck and drive. He can't drive.\"\"That's his OWN fault, not mine.\"\"Technically, I CAN drive. It's just that it's not a very good idea.\"\"Forget it, then. Never mind that I can do everything for everyone, from birth to now, but nobody can take a picture of a road arm for ME while I'm in the middle of making supper. Fine.\"\"All RIGHT! I'll send you the picture.\"Hick came home. Nary a word was mentioned about an arm in front of the Thevictorian spread. We ate supper. All dispersed. And now that I'm elbow deep in The Great Road Arm Mystery, it seems that I must ask Hick if he saw it. Because it would be SO like him to drive right by. \"Huh. A road arm. Somebody's gonna be looking for that.\"After interrogation from The Pony, let the record show that Hick did not observe an arm in the road when he arrived thirty minutes after Genius. The first question he asked was, \"Is it real?\" Is it just me, or does it seem like we Thevictorians are just too nonchalant about a possible severed arm laying on our section of gravel road? Oh, how times have changed. Beaver and Wally would have been all over that arm. And Ward would have taught them a lesson.The original owner of the road arm must have come back and picked it up. Or else we'll find it on the porch in the morning, courtesy of one of the fleabags who call this place home. Just another thread in the rich tapestry of Val Thevictorian's life. Suitable for sitcoming."}, {"title": "If You Give a Mouse a Sky Box", "date": "Tuesday, January 8, 2013", "text": "When we last convened, I had taken shelter in my dark basement lair. Directly under the master bathroom, where Hick stormed off to wreak havoc on a rodent.One might suppose it is a simple matter to unscrew a light cover and place a mousetrap inside. One would be basing that supposition on how a normal man's mind works. One might THINK one knows...but one has no idea.From up in my bathroom arose such a clatter, mice 'round the world stirred to see what was the matter. Seriously. No way should a man with a step-stool on a tile floor be making that kind of rumpus. It sounded like a cage match between Bigfoot and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. Like Hick was driving a Hummer on the rims, after police shot out his tires, down a potholed road paved with Tungsten steel. Like Hick had rented a jackhammer to break up the tile and create a tiny pit of poopy poisoned stakes covered with the bathroom rug for Mousy to impale himself upon while dashing about all willy-nilly after evacuating his bowels in my vent fan light fixture. After fifteen minutes of this stressful cacophony, I heard the creak of Hick's La-Z-Boy. Where he sat, bonbonless, to await the capture.Within ten minutes, I heard the clunk of the La-Z-Boy. The opposite of the creak. That mean that Hick had catapulted himself out of the chair. I followed the sound of his seemingly footless leg stumps as they thumped across the living room to the bathroom. There was a short scuffle. Then a flush. Then the return stumping and creak. I figured Hick had taken a break from football during a commercial, and was using the facility. Standing right under the upside-down dome of death. Until I heard, \"Hey! Pony! Tell your mom I caught her mouse.\"\"Mom! Dad caught your mouse.\"\"Did you SEE it? Ask him what he did with it.\"\"He says he threw it away.\"I went to the bottom of the steps. \"You threw it away? Where?\"\"I got rid of it.\"\"It better not be in the wastebasket. I didn't hear you open the door.\"\"I...got rid of it.\"\"Where?\"\"I flushed it down the toilet! He's in the septic tank.\"\"NO! That's not normal! Pony! Do YOU think that's normal?\"\"It's really no different than a goldfish going down.\"The Pony chose this time to run a bath in the large triangle tub, mere Hick-feet away from that deathtrap in the ceiling. You're a brave one, Mr. Pony. I wouldn't come closer to that fixture than a 49-and-a-half-foot pole. The Pony enjoys his nightly soak with the coursing jets in a tub long enough for him to stretch out and float. You'd think he was swimming with the dolphins, raising the Titanic, surfing the Banzai Pipeline, or pilfering treasure from the Flor de la Mar shipwreck. Ever since he was little, my Pony has tarried an hour or so in the bath.When he returned to the basement to plop on the couch with his laptop, I asked if he heard any action in the killing field. \"Not really.\"\"Did you feel like you were being watched?\"\"No. Actually, I didn't want to look at that light. There was some kind of smear on it.\"We heard Hick hobbling back to the bathroom on the ends of his tibias and fibulas. \"Well, Pony, we got another one. He must have come in there while you were in the bathtub. I just flushed HIM, too!\"\"Let's not talk about it.\"We think those were the only two home invaders we were harboring. There was no further action throughout the night. No more mouse turds this morning. This evening, I asked Hick what that stain was in the light fixture. \"Oh, the yellow blob? I think that's a piece of cheese. I need to get it out.\"\"It's not yellow. Was there a...smear...on it?\"\"I cleaned that up last night.\"\"What did it do, decapitate them?\"\"Not all the way.\"\"What's THAT supposed to mean?\"\"It just broke their necks. One of them was a little bloody. I had to clean the blood off the rug after I dropped him.\"EEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

It's just one wacky predicament after another around here. I am seriously going to have to shop my sitcom around again. Those early episodes were nothing compared to the rich tapestry life has been weaving for me lately. If you are squeamish, or require a laugh track with your comedy, you might as well search your 150 Dish Network channels for a Seinfeld rerun. If you think you have a cast-iron constitution, read on.Hick built our house. We had plans, of course. It's not like he tried to refurbish that foreclosed old lady's shoe after her kids were taken away due to their steady diet of broth, no bread, and sound whippings. Because Hick built it over a span of about six months, he added little touches that he felt a house must have. For example, each of our three bathrooms has a ceiling vent fan/light fixture. So whenever you turn on the overhead light, that vent fan comes on. Whether you need it or not. At first this bothered me, that unneeded sound and consumption of electricity. But I've grown used to it.Our house is as old as The Pony. While he grows stronger every day, our house is beginning to age. Last week, I flipped on the light in our master bathroom, and silence slapped me in the face. The light worked. But the fan had stopped. I informed Hick. He said he would pick up a kit and replace it. Saturday, he finally got around to it. Not that he was lolling around all week in his underwear, laid back in his recliner, eating bonbons. He can't have sweets.I had noticed that the nonworking fan light was full of bugs. They seemed to appear all at once. Or maybe I never looked up at that fan light while it was working, and they had accumulated. Hick roped The Pony into helping him. He got out a stepstool thingy that my mom gave us for Christmas one year, and had The Pony on hand to hand him tools. They put the new fan light in after bowling league. When I went into the bathroom, I stepped in some of their handiwork. The wastebasket was littered with more black sprinkles than a Swensen's ice cream sundae. I picked up the rug by the shower and shook a few more in.Sunday morning, I looked up at my fan light, happily whirring away, and saw more bugs. Black spots. Uniformly-shaped black spots. I ran out to confront Hick. \"Why do we have so many bugs already in the light? You just put in a new one. What if they're not bugs....what if...they're MOUSE TURDS?\"\"I thought about that. I need to vent those fans to the outside. All this time, I've just vented them up into the attic. We might have a mouse, after this cold snap. We had one in the garage. I'll put a trap up in the light.\"\"Well, you need to. Or I'm calling an exterminator. I'm not catching the hantavirus because you didn't put a fan in right.\" Yeah. I know the hantavirus is out west. But Hick doesn't. Still, at 6:30, he had not yet put in that trap. I called on Genius, the more dextrous of my two boys. Besides, he's always gone, and hasn't done his share of Hick-helping lately.\"Come in here and get two mousetraps out from under the sink.\" It's not that we're infested. They've been there a couple years, since we had a mouse in the basement.\"Why am I getting mousetraps?\"\"You're going to take two up in the attic. Put them where you can see them every evening when you have to go check to see if we caught a mouse.\"\"We don't have a mouse!\"\"Yes, we do. In the bathroom light. There was mouse poop.\"\"That was bugs!\"\"Bugs are not all the same shape and size.\"\"You'll have to bait them.\"I put on a dash of peanut butter, and stuck a morsel of sliced cheddar to it. Off Genius went, into the attic. He was gone about ten minutes. \"Are you all right up there?\"\"I can't make them stay set. This is stupid.\"He used to have trouble setting them, snapping his fingers in the trap. I didn't hear any cries of pain this time. Hick reared his oblivious head. \"What's he doing?\"\"Mom has me setting mousetraps in the attic!\"\"I SAID I'd put one in the light. Come back down here!\" Hick stomped into the kitchen. \"Huh! No wonder. That's too much peanut butter.\" He slashed the mouse's portions, and headed for the bathroom.

Except for the enlightening squad, of course.Perhaps they've tried to drop this subtle hint all along, and it bounced right off my pointy little head. All that time I expected success to come tap tap tapping on my chamber door while I lay nap nap napping in my blue recliner. Well, forevermore!I suppose I've been lax in pouring my efforts into this writing thing. My little hobby. Regarding myself as just a frumpy high school teacher with a bad haircut and questionable fashion sense, counting the days until retirement. Okay. YEARS until retirement. So many years of hearing that those who can't DO, teach. And that we don't deserve that king's ransom we are served on a silver platter while we sit around all summer eating bonbons on the taxpayers' dime. I don't even like bonbons. But people seem to like my writing.To paraphrase Sheryl Crow, \"Teaching is what happens while I'm making plans.\" Yeah. My job will go on. But I can kick my writing up a notch. Don't cost nothin'.

I don't know where that came from. Anyhoo, I've been happy just to write my blogs and make people smile. Like Dewey and his Poopy Dance on Malcolm in the Middle. But I'm putting a stop to all that. I swear, as fans of Gone With the Wind are my witness, that I shall make a concerted effort to waste less time and write more thingies suitable for submission. Even if it takes the sacrifice of snorting more Diet Coke. And by snorting, I mean in the manner a grandpa might grab his ten-year-old grandson by the neck and wave a pint of peppermint schnapps under his nose, chuckling, \"Take a snort of that! That'll put hair on your chest!\" Not in the manner of a certain actor actually snorting coke off a porn star's behind, chuckling, \"WINNING!\"I vow to make this my New Year's resolution: send out several submissions per month. I know that's not many. But it's more than I have been sending. Baby steps. (Thanks, Bill Murray.) Indeed. That's my number one New Year's resolution. For 2014. No! Joking! For this year.Excuse me.

More accurately, it might be termed a yeariodical. It was Tiny Lights. A Journal of Personal Narrative, you know. I think I subscribed to it last year.Personal essays are like crack for Val. Not that she's a crackhead, mind you. That fiction stuff doesn't light a fire under her like a true-life tale or opinion piece. I started reading various winners from last year's contest. It was a pleasant way to while away what was left of my evening. Around about 11:00, I must have nodded off. I woke up at 1:00 with my bifocals still on, the TV off, and Tiny Lights on my chest. Well. By that time I was wide awake. I picked up Tiny Lights and proceeded to pore over the pages. Check out a couple of ads. And there was my own name!

Don't tell me all you got was a lump of coal! I'm sure some of you got an orange. Or put an orange in somebody else's stocking. Didn't you? That's the custom, you know. You can look it up on Wikipedia if you doubt me. All I know is that I ALWAYS got an orange in my Christmas stocking. Oranges are synonymous with Christmas for me. A Christmas stocking without an orange is like a day without sunshine. And I'm NOT stealing a slogan from that old Anita Bryant commercial. I'm paraphrasing. Not plagiarizing.The smell of oranges belongs with Christmas. My band used to sell citrus as a fundraiser every fall. Let me clarify, by BAND, I mean my high school band, of which I was band president, not my imaginary garage band called Mommy's Got a Headache. The boxes of grapefruit and oranges arrived right around Christmas time. That was back when you actually got something worthwhile for your donation. No slivers of wrapping paper, or twenty-six-dollar candles, or six-ounce boxes of sugar-free peanut butter cups that suddenly turned up unavailable when the order was shipped, so a six-ounce box of white-chocolate-covered peanut butter cups, bursting with sugar, was substituted, making the intended diabetic recipient of this gift unable to enjoy your good deed with the hefty price tag.I always made sure that Santa put an orange in my boys' Christmas stockings. Sometimes that meant an extra trip to the store on Christmas Eve day, because Santa was quite forgetful. The sight of my kids digging through those stockings, elbow deep in candy and trinkets, to pull that orange from the toe, then frown, demand, \"What's THIS?\" and set it aside like a hot-potato, shellacked, odious pile of dog feces made it all worthwhile.What's the deal with kids these days? Don't they know that Laura and Mary Ingalls were THRILLED to receive an orange in their Christmas stocking? That, a peppermint stick, and a rag doll were more than they ever hoped for. No net bags of gold chocolate coins, Hershey's kisses, mini Butterfingers, rubber-band-shooters that make pigs fly, and brown plastic mooses that poop jellly beans for them!So much for the specialness of the Christmas stocking orange. My boys bring them to me. \"Here. You need to do something with this.\" Oh, I've learned my lesson. One year, left to their own devices, one boy left his orange sitting in an out-of-the-way basement nook or cranny. It was discovered a month later.

That's got to be it. I have been taking a pill around 8:00 p.m. They're all gone now, but the package says the antibiotic can keep working for up to ten days. So I figure I've got several more thrill rides from the Sandman in my subconscious future.We'll only concentrate on the main dream that has stuck with me. Not the one from early this morning in which Hick took me to a casino that was a converted library. Seriously. Everybody had to be quiet, the games had no sound, and I was gambling on a microfiche machine. I did not win.My standout dream was about my grandma, my dad's mother, who passed away two years ago. In this dream, I went to her house to pick up The Pony, who had spent the night. Grandma was puttering around in her muu-muu, happy as a clam. Her dream house, like her real house, was wall-to-wall books. Floor to ceiling. Every room. My mom had dropped in, and I followed her to the library. How I knew it was the library, with EVERY room being full of books, I don't know. But in my dream world I knew it was the library.As mom walked by a set of four black-leather-bound hardbacks with no titles showing, a small black leather pouch popped out and onto the floor. Kind of like when a young Corey Feldman accidentally spilled a jar of paintbrush water on Gizmo in Gremlins, and balls of fur began popping out of his back. Gizmo's back. Not Corey's.\"Hey, what's that?\" I called to dream Mom.\"How should I know?\" she replied brusquely over her shoulder. So totally unlike her. I picked up the item. It had a zipper on one side. I opened it to find a rolled up note, like a tiny scroll with no wooden top and bottom thingies. And do you know what the scroll said? No, it was not like in A Christmas Story when Ralphie decoded the secret message to find out it was all one big commercial: Be sure to drink your Ovaltine.The very special dream scroll said: Wizards must maintain proper weight.Ahem. It's okay, Grandma. I realize I'm not svelte. Of course, when I called my mom to relate this dream to her, I made sure to say, \"No offense, Mom. But I'm sure the scroll was directed at you. It popped out right after you walked by, you know.\" Mom did not take offense.From there, the dream led me back to Grandma, in the kitchen. She pulled a neither new nor old penny from the folds of her muu-muu, and handed it to me. It was bent in the middle, vertically, but not too much. I could tell that this was her prized possession, and that she was never without it. \"See it there?\" dream Grandma asked. \"That's Walter. He buys all our tickets.\"It was the profile of a man on the back of the penny where the Lincoln Memorial belonged. And in the upper right corner of that round penny was a set of numbers. They changed like when you tilt one of those faceted things that shows a different picture depending on the angle. I pointed it out to Grandma, who had no idea those numbers changed.Now I need to find out who Walter is. And what kind of tickets he was buying. My mom says she only knows of one Walter, who was in a rock club with Grandma.Maybe I don't want to know more."}, {"title": "The Gift for the Nag.

I am talking about the gift I received from Hick. He certainly knows the way to this woman's heart.I would rate this gift right up there at #3 of Hick's all-time Valcentric gifts. That's pretty high, since he seems compelled to spoil me with treats for Christmas, my birthday, and Mother's Day. Whether I deserve them or not. He's generous like that. Plus, he knows that Val without presents is like a kitchen table bereft of a towering bowl of soup. He knows which side his bread is buttered on, as well as who butters it, who drives to town to buy his bread and butter, and who tells him as she's serving it: \"All that bread and butter is not really good for you.\" Hick is wise beyond his appearance.\"What was it?\" you ask? The #3 Hick-to-Val gift of all time? Here's a clue: my gift was not wrapped. That's because it was kind of impossible to wrap. Oh, the parts could have been wrapped individually. But what kind of gift would THAT have been? Not a very good one, I assure you. It was a package deal, without a package! I'm sure Steven Wright could make a joke out of that.My gift was not under the tree. I had other gifts, of course. Let's not forget Hick's affinity for bread and butter. But this was one that took me by surprise. Like that time my mom and dad bought Hick a used chainsaw, and put the package in their basement. After all the wrapping and bows were cleared away and people were oohing and ahhing over their gifts, with Hick trying to be a brave little chainsawless soldier, they told him to check the basement. He came up those steps carrying that box, looking like a toddler on Christmas morning. When in reality he was a grown man on Christmas day.Let's just say that I did not have to go down to the basement. My gift was revealed on Christmas Eve, as I buckled up my seatbelt, preparing to ride shotgun in the Tahoe over the creeks and through the woods, as to my sister's house we went. Being Hick, he could not hold the secret one second longer. Could not allow me to discover it for myself.\"Can you see the road?\"\"The driveway? Yes. Hey. I can see farther than ten feet! Do you have the lights on bright?\"\"Nope.\" That was a smug nope. Hick was practically polishing his fingernails on his chest pocket, exhaling on them, polishing them some more, then holding them out to admire. \"I put in new headlights for you. AND I got rid of that milky white fog inside the light cover.\"\"This is GREAT! I can see where I'm going! Without using the brights! Now I can drive at night. Without risking death by running into a cow that I can't see until too late.\"\"Anything else?\"\"Well...now that you mention it, I can see through the windshield. Is the defogger not blowing yet? Because it's not all fogged up. I don't even think my finger would leave a mark if I tried it.\" Which I did. No mark.\"I cleaned your windshield, too!\"\"With that bottle of stuff I got last month?\"\"Uh huh. Inside AND out!\"\"This is, like, the best present ever! After my office chair. I really like my office chair.\"\"See? I know what to get you. Even though you never tell me anything good that I can understand and get for you.\"\"Thank you! This is great!\"That Hick. Sometimes it takes a while for him to get the hint. But he played this one just right.That office chair, Hick's #1 gift of all time, was a stroke of genius. I had not even asked for it. He went all the way to Office Max and picked it out and put it together and kept it in the BARn until after I went to bed in the wee hours of Christmas morning, when he snuck it into my office and put it in place of my old uncomfortable squeaky chair.Gift #2 was another Christmas effort. Hick had a little help from my sister for that one. He scored us two tickets to see Jerry Seinfeld at the Fabulous Fox. I KNOW! The perfect gift for Val. Sis was getting tickets for her husband, as big a fan as Val, and called Hick to see if he wanted in on the action. Anybody who was following the event at the time might recall that it was not easy to get these tickets. Hick had to ask me for cash, because he had to pay off Sis for the use of her credit card. Thankfully, she did not charge a commission. She could not get us seats together, but at least Hick and I had a pair, and she and my brother-in-law the former mayor had a pair.Yes, it was a joyous gift-receiving holiday for Val Thevictorian. And to ward off the Even Steven curse, I will round out this proclamation by enumerating the three all-time worst gifts from Hick to Val.#1...The Pink $3.00 Change Purse/Two Boxes of Sno*Caps Combo. A Mother's Day gift hardly befitting the mother of two sons and the stepmother of two more from the tender age of five to adulthood.#2...The Disappearing Red Devil Hand-Held Mini-Vac. Presented to Val from Hick on December 25th, 1994, as she sat rocking Baby Genius, born December 12th, 1994, whisked away after gift-opening ceremonies, never to be seen again, revealed to reside in Hick's workshop two years later. The Red Devil. Not Baby Genius.#3...There is no number three. Hick's good deeds outweigh the bad. They just aren't as funny to write about.So there you have it.

The kindhearted gent had driven his wife around the end of a virtual Tierra del Fuego of Keep Out/Men Working/Construction Zone barriers in order to access the second level of the new parking garage. \"Here you go, Honey. Nobody is even here yet. We can park right next to the door.\" The ancient lovebirds hopped out of their large sport-utility vehicle and entered the building. A bank of elevators greeted them. One quick push, and a door opened as if by magic. They rode down to the ground floor of the parking garage, only to be directed outside, into a channel of wooden walls, around the side of the building, through a door, down a hallway, outside across another construction area, in a service door, and down a carpeted hallway to the casino lobby.Knowing that there would be no host around with a tank of oxygen after the return trip, Upright Q. Citizen told his missus to wait at the entrance. He selflessly hiked the trail of veers back to the vehicle, hampered by what seemed to the little woman like a twenty-minute fuge during which he rattled around the makeshift enclosure like a rat bereft of nasal cheese sensors.

Hick has not really known any hookers. THAT I KNOW OF. But he sometimes professes to be an authority on subjects that he thinks others are not well-versed in. I could see him as Michael Keaton in Mr. Mom, telling his wife's boss that he's re-wiring the house. \"Two-twenty, two-twenty-one, whatever it takes.\" Except that Hick DOES know a lot about electricity. On other subjects, he merely fancies that he is knowledgeable. Women, for instance.I once overheard Hick telling The Pony, at the tender age of six, about the quality of women in the various countries where he's traveled. And where he hasn't.\"There are some pretty girls in Sweden.\"\"Pretty girls? Like here?\"\u00a0\"There are pretty girls in Norway, too. But in England, they're not so pretty. England is like here, and some are pretty, and some are not. Now, Germany has some pretty girls...\"But that's not the hooker story. Merely a character sketch of Hick and his self-appointed authority. The hooker story began with an innocent evening of America's Most Wanted. Hick was on the case, eager to solve a crime rather than assist the boys and me in dyeing Easter eggs. We finished up and joined him in front of the TV. He filled us in on what we had missed.A serial killer had left a trail of victims across the southwest. Their pictures flashed across the screen. Not gory pictures. Candid shots. Driver's license photos. Senior pictures. They were all young women, with long, dark hair, parted in the middle. I glanced at them and exclaimed, \"They all look alike!\" Meaning that the killer had a certain type that he liked to murder. The narrator mentioned that most of the victims were prostitutes. Again, the killer had a type. Just like Jame Gumb in Silence of the Lambs had a type, his being full-figured gals with enough skin to make himself a woman-suit.Hick snorted at my proclamation that all of the victims looked alike. \"Of course they looked alike! They all had the same profession. Streetwalker.\" Along with being rooted in Mayberry in 1960 and using a Sheriff Andy Taylor euphemism for prostitutes, woefully misguided Hick seemed to think that working girls had a uniform. Like the white pants of a union painter, the ladies of the evening had their long, dark hair parted in the middle.Genius tried to explain that there were blond and redheaded prostitutes, too, with a variety of coiffures. Where my fifteen-year-old learned so much about prostitutes, I did not know. It was obviously not from his father.Hick grew downright surly upon our questioning of his call-girl knowledge. \"Fine. Make fun all you want. But the next time you want to earn forty dollars, have somebody else drive you to town to mow Grandma's lawn.\"\"Or,\" I said, \"grow your hair long, part it in the middle, and stand on the street corner.\""}, {"title": "The Valrus and the Carpenter", "date": "Thursday, December 27, 2012", "text": "Let's see...who am I in a mood to plagiarize tonight?

I broke my bifocals Christmas Eve. Contrary to popular opinion, it was NOT due to wearing a lampshade on my head at my sister's annual party. But close. While waiting for Hick to turn around the Tahoe so I did not have to walk the tightrope of the driveway curb to avoid the ditch, as I had done upon arrival, I stood in the teen-degree wind chill. Waiting. My bifocals jauntily perched upon my head. Chilling. I climbed into my personal cab, buckled my seatbelt, leaned forward to watch Hick narrowly miss the yard and a resident tree...and heard a crunch on top of my head. A piece fell onto my ample bosom. The oval thingy that keeps the metal from digging into the side of my nose.First of all, I refuse to take responsibility. I was in the PASSENGER seat, by cracky! It is not adjusted to my liking. I feel like a trucker on a hoisted-up bucket seat. I set my driver's seat lower. But the passenger seat must accommodate the legs and feet of Genius riding rear shotgun. Which puts my noggin perilously close to the ceiling. I groped myself until I had the missing link. I put it in my shirt pocket for safekeeping. Hick found it later with his foot, on the tile floor of the bathroom. Who knew he had such princess-and-the-pea manhooves? Not I. The good news is that the optometrist's office was fairly bereft of patients this morning, and my ocular issue was remedied forthwith.Oh, and that painful tooth/sinus issue of mine? Still not resolved. The confounded Convenient Care was not open Friday afternoon. Nor Monday. Nor today. I tried their main facility twenty miles south, and it was open, but with only a receptionist. Since I did not especially want a clerical worker diagnosing me, she recommended that I go next door, to the doctor used by Genius and The Pony. NOT a pediatrician, I assure you. But an osteopath. That's a long story for...never. Let's just say that my own doctor takes off the week after Christmas, and his office is in a hospital-adjacent clinic, and the parking lot is far away and crowded, and they frown upon work-ins. So I went to my kids' doc. To while away two hours and twenty minutes, but emerge triumphant with a Z-pack prescription thirteen miles away. Somewhat convenient, because I had to go there anyway to pick up a Nasonex prescription for Genius.Perhaps I neglected to mention that we received three inches of snow last night. Which turned to a glaze of ice as it landed on the salted roadways. So the going was slow and treacherous. The Pony and I left home at 10:15 this morning, after I had called around to determine where I could haul my sinus cavities for inspection. We returned at 4:00. At which time I heated up a delicious smorgasbord of Christmas day leftovers for my lupper.Hick is on his own tonight. Poor dear. Who had to work. But most certainly did not have grand plans."}, {"title": "Pillow Luminescence", "date": "Tuesday, December 25, 2012", "text": "Said Ms Val to the readers of her blogDo you see that I see?Way up near the top of my blog? A pillow, a pillow, glowing in the night,While a Pony beams with delight.While a Pony beams with delight.I had no idea this gift would please The Pony so much. It's a square, white, silky pillow that lights up when you squeeze it, and goes through several color changes. The neon green is the prettiest, but purple is good, too. It is officially called a BrightLight Pillow.Upon unwrapping this item, and taking it out of the box, before any batteries were even installed, The Pony shouted with pride, \"I'm taking THIS gift to Grandma's!\" That's a yearly thing. Each boy takes along a present which especially pleased him.The Pony has always been a tactile fellow. Squeezing and poking and touching and stroking. He petted that pretty pillow all the way to and from his grandma's house. He also received a Bug Out Bob thingie whose eyeballs pop out when you squeeze it, and a stress cupcake.Despite his penchant for feeling objects, The Pony is not half the manipulator as his brother, Genius."}, {"title": "Death Bewilders Her", "date": "Monday, December 24, 2012", "text": "I arose at the stroke of 6:00 a.m. to begin final preparations for our Christmas celebration. We will meet at my sister's house tonight, so I had several items to wrap up before slipping into the doldrums of Christmas Eve. Heh, heh! Get it? I had several items to WRAP UP! Because it's Christmas, you know. And people wrap PRESENTS! I crack myself up sometimes.Seriously. I DO have some presents to wrap up as well. And by \"some,\" I mean ALL OF THEM. I have let time get away from me this year, what with tending five batches of my World Famous Chex Mix, traipsing about eastern Missouri, going to book signings willy-nilly, and throwing away an entire day with a casino outing. Hey! All work and no gambling makes Val a dull gal. I've been typing that all afternoon. Seeing as how we're going to be snowed in here at the Overlook Hotel tomorrow.Now where was I? Oh, yes. My early morning plans included baking my third Oreo cake in less than twenty-four hours, whipping up some vegetable dip, boiling eggs and potatoes for my traditional Christmas potato salad, and washing some clothes so my boys don't have to attend family gatherings in a barrel held up by suspenders. Separate barrels, of course. These brothers don't have that much of a bond.I put on the eggs and potatoes. Unplugged my cell phone from the kitchen counter area where it had been charging all night, so it didn't get splattered with cake mix. Dumped a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch mix in a tub of sour cream from Save A Lot, and VOILA! The dip was done, man! One item checked off my list.Next up was the cake. The first thing I had done when I got up was to cut a package of Oreos in half. Part of them to ring around the bottom of the cake, and the other part to chop for the batter. Leaving five halves to stand on edge on top, of course, and the crumbs to sprinkle over the top. Because I'm not Paula Deen, I opened a box of Betty Crocker cake mix, triple fudge, to be exact, and poured it into my big mixing bowl. I added all the ingredients, jammed the beaters into my mixer, and commenced to beating. Ahem! I said, commenced to beating. Er...turned on the mixer. What's this? My mixer was dead. Dead, dead, dead. Dead as a doornail! Not a doorknob. That's what Genius tries to say. But he is wrong. In fact, he also declares that something is coming down the PIPE! Sometimes I wonder if my baby was switched in the hospital while I was swilling THE BEST GRAPE JUICE EVER after six months of no-sugar-allowed gestational diabetes.Let's see...we were talking about my dear, departed mixer. All the gunk was about to start congealing. I moved past the stove to the other end of the counter. Tried another outlet. Nope. The mixer, like Generalissimo Francisco Franco, was still dead. I grabbed the whisk I had rinsed after ranch dipping, and started whipping. Here is where you might want to make a note-to-self: beating is much less taxing than whipping. I worked up a sweat. Grew as winded as a smoker at mile 20 of the Boston Marathon. My right arm grew two sizes today. I am a human fiddler crab. That giant arm DID come in handy for stirring the Chex every fifteen minutes for two hours.I managed to get everything done this morning, with only a thirty-minute delay from my schedule. Good thing. I had to pick up a package at the dead-mouse-smelling post office. And get my 44 oz. Diet Coke, of course. I wanted it for my three-hour lunch break, to rekindle my energy before starting on the present-wrapping. While in town, my mom called on my cell phone. I heard an odd thumping noise while I talked, but assumed it was something with her land line. Since I was parked in front of the DMSPO at the time, I was not worried that I might have driven over something or someone. Imagine my surprise when I hung up to see a message that I needed to connect my phone to its charger.My phone had been on the charger all night! One little phone call should not have depleted it. By the time I got home, I had forgotten all about Phony. I had a 44 oz. Diet Coke, and three hours of free time! In passing, I mentioned to Hick that my mixer had expired. Just in case he needed an idea for a last-minute gift. Even though my mom had told me she had a perfectly good mixer still in the box. Because you can never have too many mixers, you know. For those holidays when you need to bake three Oreo cakes in less than twenty-four hours.Hick treated me like he was the slot machine attendant at River City. Looked askance. \"How do you KNOW your mixer is dead?\" Like I was obviously making it all up to score a new mixer for Christmas. He grabbed it from where I'd left it plugged in. Pushed the button. Nothing. Dead as a doorNAIL. Hick is knobber, too. I explained that it did not work in either outlet.\"Well, I'll go see if the breaker is tripped. Maybe you did something when you plugged it in. It's made to trip if there's a problem.\" Off he went to the master bathroom walk-in closet, to the main panel, installed by he, himself, and him when we built the house. He came back and turned on the mixer. It whirred to life. Resuscitated. By the man who runs electric for a living, in a county with lax codes, able to work without benefit of membership in the international brotherhood. The man who had installed the electricity to begin with. Electricity that can't take a jabbing in its outlet without shutting down.That explained the wasting away of my cell phone. It had been plugged into that wall all night. I've really got to be more careful about how I jam the prongs into the socket. It's not a slot card scanner, you know."}, {"title": "It's Not the Riches You Measure, But How You Measure Riches", "date": "Sunday, December 23, 2012", "text": "We got trouble, my friends, right there. I say trouble, right there in River City. Trouble with a capital \"T\" and that rhymes with \"C\" and that stands for card!Upon arrival, Hick and I hightailed it to the customer service desk at the casino. We had to get a player's card, you see. We ain't about to throw away our hard-earned cash without being tracked. No sirree, Bob! Oh, how I long for the olden days at Harrah's. They gave you one of those little telephone-cord stretchy thingies for your player's card. That made it harder for you to forget your card in a machine, that little tether that came in assorted colors. It was fun to swing that card around on it, too. And you know what? They'd give you another one if you said you lost yours! For free!River City hands you a naked card. No tether. How low-rent is THAT? I'm sure they're doing it to save the environment. Less petroleum products needed to manufacture those plastic card-leashes. That's gotta be it. River City. Saving the planet one stretchy tether at a time.I snatched my card and elbowed my way through the crowd to a three-reel quarter machine. None of that fancy video garbage for me. Val gambles old-style. She'd feed that machine tokens if River City hadn't gone green and stopped mining minerals and concentrated on de-foresting the landscape for tickets instead. Trees. A renewable resource. AND...no tokens means no plastic cups to jangle them in. Another million barrels of petroleum saved. By Val alone. With the help of River City.Technically, there was no crowd. It was 9:00 on a Saturday morning. Which is not to say there was a lack of drinking and smoking. I sat a spell at two different slots. Then it happened. MY CARD WOULD NOT BE RECOGNIZED! It was like the Taiwan of slot cards. Every time I put it in, the machine told me, \"Reinsert player card.\" So I did. And it told me again. So I did. And it told me again...This was fast becoming the most unproductive money-losing trip ever.I tried five different machines. Same result. I rubbed the card on my shirt. I inserted it fast. In inserted it slow. No dice. If that one-armed moneysucker had a hand, and that hand had fingers, I know which one he would have been flipping me. I smelled a conspiracy. Oops! That was just smoke from the cooler the casino boss had sent to sit next to me wherever I played, chimneying it up like the gaming floor was one big smokeless ashtray. I was sure each slot machine that would not let me play was a winner. Never mind that I could have played without my card. I wanted my losses tracked, by cracky!I stumbled upon Hick, happy as a pig in a BARn being held against his will until sausage could be made of him. He said his card did the same thing, but he just put it in slowly and it was accepted. Yeah. That's what HE said. A casino worker came by. I told him I was having a problem with my card. Well. Since I must be the liar lady Penelope from SNL as portrayed by Kristen Wiig, he told me to insert the card while he was watching. C'mon. You can't tell me the security people weren't guffawing as I went from machine to machine, like Tom Chaney in True Grit trying to catch a ride to Ma's riding double on somebody else's horse.The message window said, \"Reinsert player card.\" Nyah, nyah, aging little man in a red vest patrolling quarter slots in River City. Don't make me into that hypochondriac who had \"I TOLD you I was sick!\" engraved on her tombstone. He told me to try again. Like that thought had never occurred to me. Finally, he took my card and WIPED HIS THUMB ACROSS THE MAGNETIC STRIP. \"Now try it.\" Of course the darn thing worked. That one time. Thumbkin was gone faster than the Road Runner from an ACME catastrophe. When I tried to insert my card in a slot I actually wanted to play, I again got the reinsert message. Apparently, River City hires folks with magical thumbs. My thumb is no Digit Copperfield. If I had written a song about my trials, it would have been called Six Steps Back and One Step Forward. When I found a machine that would take my card, I glommed onto it like a wad of Bubblicious onto the unkempt tresses of a toddler just risen from her naptime cot.Val was not a monetary winner.

Right? RIGHT? Oh. I forgot. I am confident. No need to ask that question.Hick and I ditched The Pony early this morning, and left Genius home in bed. Don't even ask if we left the two of them home together. Their symbiotic relationship is not one of mutualism (where both benefit), nor even of commensalism (where one benefits, and the other is neither helped nor harmed). No. It is closer to parasitism (one benefits, and the other is harmed). That now concludes today's biology lesson on ecological relationships.We sped off to River City with Hick behind the wheel. After a discussion of what's wrong with society today, I turned my attention to reading the National Enquirer. Did you know a dude on death row says he videotaped OJ Simpson murdering his ex-wife? Me neither! All these years, this dude from Ohio has kept this secret. He was a house painter OJ hired to spy on his ex, but he was really going to blackmail the ex if he caught men going into her house. A real double-dipper, that dude. So in the midst of videotaping OJ murdering Ron Goldman, which he didn't capture very well because it was out of focus, Dude hid the video because he didn't want to be implicated in the crime! And he hightailed it back to Ohio. Where he became a murderer himself! Told the Enquirer that the tape is still right where he hid it in 1994! And even though he's been on death row for quite some time, he's just now coming forward, because he didn't want OJ to put out a hit on him. Even though he was already on death row. What a break in that case that's already been settled. Twice.I know Seinfeld was just fiction. And that the act of those hipster doofuses yakking it up instead of helping a fat man being robbed is not what the Good Samaritan Law is all about. But I'm pretty sure that videotaping two murders, and being proud to hold that tape as evidence, would be frowned upon in the state of California. But enough of the Enquirer, and back to ME! I had to read to keep my eyes off Hick's driving. It is my opinion that he should go the speed limit, in the right lane, without cruise control, allowing mergers space. That is not Hick's style. I'm pretty sure his style is called Drive in the Middle of Six Lanes Between Two Tractor-Trailer Trucks Without Breaking Cruise Control Set at 70. Because I'm a giver, I read out loud to Hick. He was most interest in the stories about the American Picker with Crohn's disease, and the Pawn Stars chick with tattoos and a secret porn past. He wanted to see the pictures, but I told him to keep his eyes on the road. Then when we got home, I handed off that Enquirer to my mom, forgetting about Hick's wish to view the pic. Oops! My bad. It's because I'm such a giver, you see.Now where was I? Oh, yeah. The casino trip. We didn't win. BUT...we can each be reimbursed for up to $500 in losses, because this was our first time there. Actually, we have been there twice, right after they opened. But since they had no record of us, we are new gamblers. And will get mailings with offers for our loss reimbursement, which we have to go into the casino to redeem. It's better than nothing, I suppose. Though I doubt it's as good as Harrah's used to treat us, what with monthly mailings containing $25 slot vouchers, and $15 restaurant coupons.There's a little more to the story, which I may or may not tell, as the mood strikes, or I am bereft of other ideas. Bottom line, a good time was had by all, and poor, downtrodden Hick was thanked profusely for the selfless offer of his Saturday, if not for his highway sweaving skills."}, {"title": "Snowman Knows What You Did This Winter", "date": "Friday, December 21, 2012", "text": "Snowman knows that you did not decorate the standard-issue teacher's door.

I don't know what it is. Or if it even has feet. But it would behoove that something to knock it off. To cease and desist with the shenanigans.Last Saturday morning, The Pony and I headed out to the garage at 7:55 on our way to town for his academic tournament. Genius was sleeping in, as was Hick the sicko. I had awoken Hick to tell him we were leaving. He mumbled, coughed, and pulled the quilt back over his head. Because he has the breather, you see, to keep him ventilated.The Pony rounded the corner of the house first, and trotted down the four steps to the garage. He pulled open the green metal door with the half glass, and said softly, \"That's weird. Dad's garage door is up.\" Which got my attention, because all manner of critters come in if the garage door is up. Possums and skunks and our dogs and other dogs and chickens and mice and baby moles and frogs. Most of them want to eat the dry cat food out of the roaster pan. The frogs, I suspect, just take a wrong turn on the way to the fish pond.\"Your dad must have left it open last night when he got home from the auction.\"The Pony busied himself with scooping some cat food into the empty pan. \"But Mom. The LIGHT is o---.\" At that moment, the overhead garage light went off. It comes on when the door goes up, then goes off after a minute or two. Which would mean that the garage door had just gone up as we were leaving the kitchen for the garage. With nobody there. With Hick's garage door opener on the sun visor of his car, and the wall-mounted control a doorbell button five feet high, right beside the walk-in door.\"Huh. Maybe your dad got up and fed the cats while I was in the shower.\"\"Mom! The light would have been off by now. And there was no food in the pan.\"We drove off to town. After closing that creepy garage door. When I got home, I grilled Hick and Genius. At separate times, of course, due to their different get-up times. Hick swore that he had not been outside. He suggested that the garage mouse the cats refuse to kill was responsible. That it ran up the wall and pushed on that doorbell button with its tiny hand-like mouse feet. A feat that would have necessitated the Garage Nest Mousester to hang perpendicular and pound that doorbell with a tiny mouse sledgehammer.Genius related that when he arrived home Friday night, Hick's garage door was up. But since Hick was asleep, and he'd been so sick, he was probably incoherent from cough medicine, so Genius did not bother him. Neither did he close the garage door. Which still did not explain the light on Saturday morning. Genius said the light is activated by a motion sensor. So maybe a cat or mouse ran in front of it. Which would mean they had to be up on the metal garage door tracks, because we don't set off the light when we walk around in the garage.I called my mom to kill some time while waiting for The Pony to get done with his tournament so we could start our Book House excursion. We dissected the facts. The dogs had gone crazy barking when I got out of the shower. Something must have been out there. Maybe thieves were cruising around with a clicker, trying garage doors at random, making plans to come back when nobody was home. Some people have garages with doors that enter right into their kitchen, doors they don't lock. My mom used to be a big Murder She Wrote fan. In the middle of telling her about the garage door mystery, I got a creepy feeling in my chest. What if a person had walked in the garage door by the porch, pushed the button to open Hick's garage door, heard us coming, and jumped in Hick's Pacifica to hide? What if there had been a creeper laying down in Hick's car while The Pony and I dithered about the mystery? With only a thin layer of metal separating us? EEEEEEEE!Last night, Genius and Hick were both out on the town. The Pony and I were watching Redneck Island. At 8:50, we heard footsteps above. They continued in the area of the boys' bathroom, and Genius's room. The Pony tried to deny it. But every now and then, he'd say, \"I heard THAT! I think I'll wait until Dad gets home from the auction to go up and have my shower.\" I went into my office around 9:30. By 10:15, he was tired of waiting. He started up. Midway, he stopped. \"Did you hear that one? It was in Genius's room. Now I hear feet walking through the kitchen!\" He ran back down the steps and into my office. \"It must be Dad.\" We waited. No more footfalls above. Nobody home.The Pony went back to watch TV. I called Genius, who had been at a friend's house since afternoon. \"Where are you? When are you coming home?\"\"I'm still here watching a movie. I'll be home before midnight.\"\"Well, something has been looking for you for the last hour and a half. Just so you know.

I don't mean to be forward, asking such a personal question. It's really none of my business if you're a hoarder, or one of those people who has a compulsion to dust and vacuum before the cleaning lady comes over.The reason for my inquiry is nosiness. Pure and simple. Like when a kid goes next door to play pool in the neighbor's concrete shed out back, and tires of reading ancient TV Guides between turns, and asks her friend what is in the olive green locker standing in front of the north window, a locker which her friend refers to as a chifforobe, but which appears to have something to do with her father's one weekend a month and two weeks a year absence with the National Guard. The locker which objects to having its door yanked open, and bashes the friend in the knee, causing it to spurt blood so badly that when the friend hollers for her momma, the kid lays down the TV Guide open to the Dick Van Dyke show on an old and quietly slips out the door for home, returning hours later to observe the knotty stitches in her friend's knee.My teaching buddy says her husband does not allow her to keep books. That as soon as she is through with them, they are donated to St. Vincent de Paul. The lone exception is her collection of John Grisham books. I, on the other hand, hang onto my books. I read them again and again. Sometimes, I end up with two of the same title. The high cost of hoarding, I suppose. The books I can bear to part with linger. Not intentionally. I pack them up in boxes and set them by the basement door. Where Hick finds them, and fills a perfectly good bookshelf where I had harvested them to make room for new acquisitions. One step forward until Hick steps back.My books are in primo condition. I sometimes fancy myself taking up the eBay hobby, or becoming an Amazon seller, and passing them off as new. Shh...nobody has to know that they have been read one time. I don't drop crumbs in them, sneeze green boogers onto their pages, use a slice of braunschweiger as a bookmark, or leave them face-down, gasping for their literary breath, for lengthy periods of time. Val's used books are the new new books.Hey! Did you know that not all people treat a book with such tender loving care? I found that out the hard way. When people loan me a book, I treat it as my own. Gently. Respectfully. I am the perfect book date. I would never paw at Booksie like an animal. I caress her. Make her comfortable. Adjust her jacket, lest she catch a chill. Should we take a walk down a medieval street, I would be careful to walk next to the road. No garbage or chamber pot effluence is going to land on my sweet Booksie. I make it a point to have her back home on time. Intact.But some people are deviants! One colleague took my own sweet Booksie and sullied her to the point of non-recognition. Broke her spine. Gave her pages incurable scoliosis. Bent her wrap behind her back until she was permanently exposed. Returned her to me in much the same manner as Pinto returned the mayor's drunk daughter, though stopping short of parking sweet Booksie on my front lawn in a shopping cart. And then acted like nothing untoward happened!Some people should be banned from books.

Good ol' Ben Franklin said, \"Fish and visitors stink after three days.\" To which I say, Ben really needed a better class of visitor, or to quit taking them out kite-flying all the live-long day. Or to feed them some stinky fish to set them on their way.I would never do that. Feed people stinky fish. In fact, I took special care to choose items for the canned food drive at The Book House last Saturday. And by special care, I mean that I reached into my pantry on the way out the door, and grabbed something that I thought folks might enjoy.C'mon. You all remember grade school, when you asked your mom for a can of food for the food drive, and she told you to pick one out, and you thoughtfully seized a can of creamed corn. Because you darn sure didn't want to have to eat that creamed corn yourself. That goes for peas and beets, too. It made me feel so GOOD to help people. To allow them to feast on my creamed corn. I was sure the children who were my age would have thanked me profusely if they knew I was behind the yearly influx of creamed corn.As I grabbed the makings of an eclectic smorgasbord off my shelves, I wondered how my donation would be perceived from a Seinfeld perspective. I knew darn good and well not to donate muffin stumps. Rebecca DeMornay made her feelings on that foodstuff quite clear. But this collection was no muffin stump. It was a meal in itself. There was something from every canned-food group. A can of white-meat chicken, some Chunky Sirloin Burger soup, hot dog chili sauce, tomato sauce, black olives, Combos Buffalo Blue Cheese Pretzels, and a box of instant hot chocolate packets. Mmm. Though some might not serve all these taste treats together, and prefer, in fact, to mix and match with other donations.If it was in Val's pantry, it has to be good. No way was I going to give delicacies like baby corns in a jar, hearts of palm, huitlacoche, paddlefish caviar, or pickled pigs' feet. No sirree, Bob! Nobody really likes that stuff. Except maybe that weirdo Andrew Zimmern on Bizarre Foods on The Travel Channel. He gets paid to like it. He's always waxing orgasmic over a gelatinous cartilaginous pig's knuckle stew, or rooster testicle soup.I only regret that I could not part with sardines in mustard sauce. I love that stuff."}, {"title": "Fortune and Hick's Eyes", "date": "Thursday, December 13, 2012", "text": "My continuing series on The Book House visit would not be complete without an account of Hick's take on the facility.The Pony and I only thought he had gone to sit in the car and wait for us. Au contraire. Hick had dumped his bag o' books and returned. He headed upstairs to see if he could find anything old, I suppose. He likes to pick up flea market and auction items that he can use to furnish his creekside cabin.Hick declared that the railing on the stairs would be in high demand. \"People buy those things to put in their houses!\" Well. That's certainly deep thinking. I suppose what he meant to express was that it looked like an old piece of history, and antique collectors might clamor for it. Don't worry. I did not let him bring any tools along. So clandestine dismantling while I was clucking at a hen party downstairs was out of the question.Hick also fancied the clawfoot tub in the bathroom. I think he was just taking himself on an unauthorized tour, not marking his territory. He has a fascination with clawfoot tubs. Notices them in farmers' fields, acting as watering troughs for cattle. Never mind that there is not enough room in his cabin for a clawfoot tub. Or that it doesn't even have a bathroom. Just an outhouse. I shudder to think that Hick is planning to pick up a pair so we can while away our golden years laying side-by-side in bubble-bath-filled clawfeet, watching the sunset. Because there is no sunset down in the woods by the creek. We would have to be in the front yard. A site not conducive to clawfeet courtin'.Being a safety committee facilitator at work, traveling to safety conventions on the company dime, quoting OSHA bylaws willy-nilly...Hick had a thing or two to say about The Book House decor. \"I'm surprised the Fire Marshall hasn't shut them down! That's an accident waiting to happen. All those books crammed in so you can hardly walk. If you're in the basement and a fire breaks out, you're dead.\" Said the man whose BARn looks much the same way downstairs, yet not nearly so neat, without noticeable walkways, and metal rather than paper as the clutter of choice.Apparently Hick has also been named a zoning commissioner. \"I can't believe that house is sitting in that area. I'm sure they were grandfathered in.\"Hick is the kind of person who would tear down paradise to put up a parking lot if it meant he could scavenge paradise for old stuff to put in his cabin."}, {"title": "A Denizen of the Deep?", "date": "Wednesday, December 12, 2012", "text": "The Pony ventured to the basement of The Book House to look for bargains. But mainly just to see the basement. To see if there was any ghostly vibe down there. He's one for watching ghost-hunting shows. Even that fakey one on The Travel Channel where the dude berates the spirits. The one I refuse to watch.He took a few pictures with his camera. One came out totally blurred, though he swore he held his phone just as steady as he did with the other three pictures. Here's two that he found interesting.Okay. So The Pony lacks focus. But the part of the picture he likes is the streak that comes down in front of that light. And the glare between two lights in the next picture.The Pony enjoyed himself immensely. He burned through Ender's Game, which Sioux bought for him, between 7:00 Sunday evening, and noon on Monday. He said it was the BEST BOOK EVER, and asked for the rest of the series for Christmas. Tuesday he started one of the science fiction books he bought, finished it tonight, and asked for another. Of course I gave in. He will just have to cry on Christmas morning when there is nothing under the tree for him besides that series.Yeah. Well.

Sorry if that's too graphic for you. I have never been...how you say...um...socially acceptable. At least I did not use that as my title.The book-signing gals at The Book House on Saturday might as well have been hosting their own talk show. I envisioned Sioux as the host, because she was on the end, and had a hand in everything. Donna was relegated to co-host status because she sat beside the host. But she also doubled as sidekick, what with her snappy repartee. Beth the Bandleader was actually getting down to business, signing books as intended. Plus she was the most hip, as a bandleader should be. Not that I'm calling Sioux and Donna hipster doofuses.Sioux welcomed Val with a crateful of fudge. That's why the green room was bereft of snacks. In addition, Sioux bestowed upon her first guest a Palahniuk. Talk about swag. This is the talk show to appear on. Sioux obviously didn't trust the cameraman to record the event for posterity. So she whipped out her own camera and stole a little piece of Val's soul. She was careful, though, to catch Val in a good light. One that did not expose her entire face. Nor break the camera.Lynn, the producer/stage manager, the Gelman to Sioux's Regis, had her hands full. Keeping Sioux from darting offstage willy-nilly to purchase books for her guests was a full-time job. Which probably didn't pay much, because the host was throwing money away left and right on literature and fudge makings.Donna the sidekick was content to bide her time. She may have looked sweet, sitting at the left hand of Sioux, but she had a little vinegar in her. Donna revealed herself like a Stealth Bomber on a nighttime training mission over a UFO convention in Roswell, New Mexico. Showing her true colors when Hick was welcomed to the stage. Donna smiled angelically as Val introduced Hick. \"We've read all about you,\" she deadpanned. Sweetly. With a knowing smile. A smile not deciphered by Hick.Guest comedian Linda O'Connell popped in. She had been scheduled as the warm-up act, but ran late due to her cookie addiction. Linda was kind enough to nomenclate Val with a new alias. Or two. The Hooker for short. And Streetwalker for long. Val was hoping that Linda might use the diminutive for that last one, and simply call her St.....alker. But that was not to be. Linda was kind enough to take time out from writing that new gift book bestseller, 101 Baby Names that Nobody Every Suggested, to appear on the show. People entering The Book House might have been surprised as Linda opened the door and shouted down the porch steps, \"Hey! Hick!\" just before snapping a picture. And been doubly surprised when a man responded, thus admitting to being a hick. They might have assumed it was some crazy thespian act to entertain them while waiting in line. Kind of like the train robbers at Silver Dollar City.Tammy apparently got bumped from the show, due to Val bringing The Pony along for exposure. She was cordial to Val in the entryway as Val made it her exitway. Tammy is one smart cookie. Shh...don't let Linda hear that cookie part. As Val tried to trick her with a seemingly innocent inquiry as to whether Tammy's purse held blue pens, the light of realization dawned in Tammy's eyes. She snatched that purse away from Val's reach like the dogwalker snatched his leashed canine just before a sleeping Clark Griswold plowed over him with the Family Truckster. The purloining of pens was narrowly avoided.Beth graciously struck up the band, the credits began to roll, and the show personnel chatted in a tightknit group about how best to rectify this episode's low ratings during sweeps week."}, {"title": "There's a Fungus Among Us", "date": "Monday, December 10, 2012", "text": "We now take a brief respite from the book-signing shenanigans in order to illustrate the burden that The Pony must bear in being the beloved son of Val Thevictorian.On the way home to Backroads, Hick's thoughts turned to feeding stations along the route. He was pushing Red Robin with all the gusto of a tow-headed two-year-old pushing one of those dadburned popcorn-popper contraptions. The Pony agreed that he would consume something from that establishment. Hick declared that he knew just where one was located, having seen it on his trip to the eye specialist for some minor surgery a couple months ago.Hick sweaved and he swove, maneuvering my Tahoe through surging Saturday-evening traffic like George Costanza saving a record-high Frogger machine from a power outage. Shooting out onto a four-lane one-way thoroughfare, Hick commanded us to look for the Red Robin sign. Darkness was falling. Neon lights glowed. I spied a Surf and Turf where Hick imagined a Red Robin. Then we both saw it. Red Robin on the left. Three lanes over. Receding in our rear-view mirrors.\"Hey, there's an ophthalmologist surgery center.\"\"I know. That's where I went for my eye surgery.\"\"It's right across from the Red Robin.\"\"Yeah. I knew it was here somewhere.\"\"Huh. I guess you couldn't see it clearly. BECAUSE YOU'D JUST HAD EYE SURGERY!\"There was no going back. Hick rejected Plan B proposed by Val, which was the Festus Imo's. He instead offered Plan C. \"...some Chinese place where CiCi's used to be.\" The Pony and I were on board. We filed in and grabbed plates. The Pony opted for his standby, Sweet and Sour Chicken. He placed his napkin across his khaki-shorted lap like a well-bred little country beast, so as not to drip sticky sauce onto his clothing. He is the antithesis of the bespotted Genius, he whom the Tide Pen inventor envisioned as his target market.Somewhere in the feeding frenzy, I opted to try a fried frog's leg. I had not grabbed it the first go round. The more I thought of that pan of frogs' legs, the more I knew I must take the bait. When else am I going to come across frogs' legs that are so easy for the taking? Of course, nobody can put a single frog's leg on a plate at a Chinese buffet. So I slapped on a few slices of peppered beef. Some more tasty mushrooms in garlicky spicy brown sauce that I'd sampled on the first plate.By the time I sat back down, The Pony beside me had finished his meal of S & S Chicken and two sugary biscuits. He fiddled and faddled. He'd forgotten to bring in a phone for gaming, or a book to pass the time. He stirred his Sprite in excess. Hick told him to cool it. The Pony heaved a sigh. He looked at my plate.\"Hey, try a bite of this frog's leg. C'mon. You can tell everybody that not only did you go to a haunted bookstore, you ate a frog's leg.\"\"No. I'm not eating that.\"\"C'mon. You'll be sorry.\"\"No I won't. I'm not eating it.\"\"Huh. Neither am I right now. That is HOT!\" I had taken a bite, and hot grease shot out. Luckily it only burned my side-lip, rather than dripping to stain my shirt.\"See? Aren't you glad I didn't try it and make a mess?\" The Pony took the napkin off his lap and put it on the table.I forked a bit of peppered beef into my mouth, and went to stab a mushroom. It refused to be stabbed, and skittered out from under my tines like a tiddly-wink leaping out from under the edge of the shooter, LANDING ON THE PONY'S LEFT THIGH ON THE POCKET OF HIS KHAKI CARGO SHORTS.\"Really, Mom? Really?\"I cleaned him up the best I could before he had to walk out. Did you know that a bit of Diet Coke dripped from a straw and scratched in with a fingernail can lift a greasy stain as good as a Tide Pen?

The Book House trip by the family Thevictorian was a rousing success.Hick scoped out the place like a future real estate investment for when he wins the PowerBall. He hiked down to the bargain basement and found five books for himself. That they were all children's books was not a source of embarrassment for Hick. After all, he's the guy who moved my belongings from our old house, and filled the living room bookshelf with \"the books that were most colorful.\" Hick indeed judges a book by its cover. What's between the bindings makes no nevermind to him. It's not like he's actually going to READ those books. He wanted them for his creekside cabin. I will have to post some pictures of its interior one of these days. As thanks to Hick for taking me to such a foreign destination as a bookstore. He told me what a bargain he got, and related that he didn't have a book younger than 1935. Which is surprising, since I saw Goodnight Moon, and Google tells me that a first edition is 1947. Let's hope The Book House is not trafficking in counterfeit Goodnight Moons.The Pony found four science fiction books, and Sioux bought him Ender's Game. He is thrilled with his take. We had planned on them being Christmas presents, since he cannot name anything he wants, and will face the fate of Old Mother Hubbard's dog when he looks under the tree Christmas morn if he doesn't formulate a wish list soon. I relented and told him that he can pick one book to read now, along with Ender's Game, and I will wrap the others. He'll forget the titles by then, and they will be a surprise.I feared that The Book House would give me a fit of claustrophobia. The pictures on the website definitely do it justice. A manatee-like woman such as myself does not seek out narrow hallways and cramped quarters. I get antsy in Walmart when people squeeze past my cart. However, I felt at ease in the presence of the booksigners extraordinaire. I did not venture up the stairs, nor down into the basement. I could have given the weather forecast for today based solely on the protestations of my knee joints. Dave Murray ain't got nothin' on Val when it comes to falling barometric pressure. More on the House itself tomorrow. Or the next day.The signers were Beth M. Wood, Donna Volkenannt, and Sioux Roslawski. I grabbed a couple of books, which were going like hotcakes, according to the proprietor of The Book House, and stepped up for my signatures.I was remiss in chatting with Beth. She had real people standing around her, awaiting her John Hancock. I did not want to horn in on their experience, so I moved on down the line to Donna.I must say, that Donna is quite a mannered lady, no tobacco-chawin' or inappropriate scratching for that one. At least in public on this day at The Book House. I let it slip that I am anonymous, and that she could sign my book to Val or to my real name. With that, Sioux's ears perked up like those of an overnight guard Doberman on a lumber yard parking lot upon hearing footsteps crunching on gravel.My first impression of Sioux was that her head certainly LOOKED like it would fit in a faculty restroom sink without any ill effects. My second impression was that Sioux was peering at me like a woman trying to commit my features to memory, in order to create an accurate likeness for the construction of a voodoo doll later in the evening.Sioux introduced Lynn Obermoeller, who was quite friendly and gracious to me, though I suspect her real purpose was to keep Sioux under surveillance for the good of all patrons of The Book House that evening.T'Mara Goodsell materialized out of thin air, which was a bit unsettling. Since she's done time in the trenches of public school educational facilities, I look upon this skill as a superpower, and not something to be controlled by placing a box of TicTacs in her pocket to announce her future sidling.Taking seven point two minutes out of her writing, submitting, crafting, picture-taking, and beach-dreaming schedule, Linda O'Connell strolled in to wreak havoc. Just one more service she offers.

Hick has been doped up to that fine line between coughing up his left lung and driving under the medfluence. The Pony is back from his smart tournament. I've painted up my lips and rolled and curled my tinted hair. Wait a minute! That's Ruby, pre- taking her love to town. I haven't done that. But I am, you know, contemplating going out somewhere.Now for the issue of how to pass the time during the drive. I am not a good passenger. I'm sure that comes as a shock to those of you who've read my scathing reviews of OPD. Other People's Driving. Hick, in his weakened state, would be no match for my side-seat driving commands. So I must distract myself from his sweaving, and leave that business to a man and his GPS.The Pony will be of no help. He's low-maintenance. A book, a Kindle, a laptop, a phone game...any or all will be his focus. I daresay we could drive from Backroads to Hawaii in a tricked-out Duck (the amphibious vehicle, not the fowl), and The Pony would not bother to raise his head for an appearance off the starboard bow of a mission of mermaids.I could use the time to read one of the many books that are stacked and waiting in various Pisa-towering piles, turning slowly to dust as I breeze past them every day. But the removal of a single book might Jenga the stack. I could nap. But then I wouldn't know if Hick succumbed to his lung-sparing elixir and started sleep-driving like Clark Griswold piloting the Family Truckster. I could take my special little notebook, three of which the boys and Hick gave me for Mother's Day, and only one of which I now retain possession, and jot down notes for hilarious and riveting blog posts. Or at least for blog posts. But then I would have to find some way to hide it upon my person while out of the Tahoe and inside The Book House. Because if Hick is inside the car without me, he will be all up in that.One boundary that Hick does not understand is privacy. Never mind that he would not read a national bestseller if I wrote one. If I left a notebook carelessly in his line of sight, he would examine that journal with a fine-toothed comb. In Hick's mind, I am some dastardly dame who might as well change her name to Harriet Plotter. A schemer, I am, intent on overthrowing Hick's oligarchy, composed of he, himself, and him. Sending out feelers for an eventual abscondence with a Fabio-coiffed viscount of indeterminate nationality. Or a tubby, bespectacled French model that I met on the internet. Bonjour.So...I will most likely stare straight ahead, fingernails gouging my palms, while I endure the death-defying drive at the hands of Hick.

Putting your fingers in your ears is not going to stop me. I'm a born warbler. I can sing like a canary in a coal mine. Which is a bit of foreshadowing, perhaps, in this being a limited engagement.You might be thinking that I'm belting out my appreciation for Hick acting as the chauffeur of my Chevy limousine to the grand book-signing extravaganza on Saturday. But I'm not. Oh, I sincerely extend props to Hick for being such a sit-down guy, he of the driver's seat, looking left, looking right, occasionally looking where he's going. But there's another arena where Hick cannot hide his beacon under an air-tight bushel. And that is family safety.Sunday night, The Pony and I heard Hick stomping around in the kitchen overhead. Hick doesn't regard it as stomping. He thinks he is walking. Which he is. Like a man with no feet at the end of his ankles. Stomping around on stumps with no fat-pad cushions at the heels and balls of his feet. Even though he has them.\"Hey! Don't eat the pepper cheese!\"This was an odd command. First of all, we had just consumed a tasty supper of beans and ham and corn muffins an hour earlier. Perhaps a meal that was not sticking to Hick's ribs, but was at least lingering in his large intestine. I have almost thrown in the towel in the contest of assigning a method to Hick's madness. I decided that he was making lunch for work on Monday. Yeah. That must be why he was into the cheese right after a sumptuous repast.Secondly, Hick need not tell The Pony and me not to eat the pepper cheese. Because we don't eat the pepper cheese. Ever. It's spicy, you know. And has those red and green flecks of pepper where nothing but holes or more cheese should be. He might as well tell Superman not to eat the kryptonite.Thirdly, it's not like Hick to warn us away from something he wants to save all for himself. That's because he's quite adept at eating things others would like to save for themselves. So he figures if he lets people eat his stuff, he has free rein to consume anything he runs across, no matter whether it was a special item reserved for a gala affair, or a birthday treat, or items already promised to my mom. \"All right. We won't eat the pepper cheese. Why do you say that?\"\"It has MOLD on it!\" Hick acted like this was a personal affront. How dare that cheese allow nature to take its course! That cheese conspired against him. Who woulda thunk that a package of cheese left on the top shelf of the refrigerator for a month, having the hands of Hick and Genius paw it willy-nilly with questionable hygiene, would sprout hyphae? Not Hick. He wouldn't know a hypha if it twined itself around his butt and colonized it for the planet Mold.This is where the going gets tough. Would a normal person not throw away moldy cheese? Did Hick worry that The Pony and I would claw through the tall kitchen wastebasket and find that pepper cheese that we never eat, and say, \"Hey! Hot furry green wastebasket cheese! Let's have some!\" Or did he think the proper procedure upon discovery of moldy cheese is to put it right back in the refrigerator where you found it? Yes. Hick's heart is in the right place. It's his cheese that needs to be moved."}, {"title": "This Much I Learned for Sure", "date": "Thursday, December 6, 2012", "text": "This has been a hectic week around the Thevictoraian household.

I say loved, which is an emotion not always manifested in physical measures such as hugging and kissing and breathing the same air as your paramour when he is harboring bacteria in his sinuses, more bacteria in his ears, and a fever beneath his skin.******************************************************** Just because a school cafeteria lists broccoli and salad on the day's menu does not mean they are actually serving two sides, one being broccoli, and one being salad. A fact which turns teenagers and faculty alike into younger, taller, vegetarian Clara Pellers. The answer to their demand of, \"Where's the broccoli?\" was met with the explanation that the broccoli was in the salad. Indeed, each person found one floret in their lettuce-and-cheese compartment.******************************************************** A fifty-three-year-old woman in Florida was arrested for riding a manatee. The maximum fine for which is $500 and six months in jail. She was arrested at the Sears department store where she works, and claimed that she did not know there was a law against touching a manatee, because she had just recently moved to Florida. Which made my bullcrap detector go off. Sure. Like there's really a Sears department store still open.But seriously. You can't tell me Aquatic Annie Oakley thought manatee-riding was to Floridians as four-wheel-riding is to Missourians. It's not like she just patted the thing on its snout. She rode on its back. At fifty-three years old. If you saw the pictures, you might be hard-pressed to say which was the woman, and which was the manatee. She's no anorexic model, our Aquatic Annie Oakley.Even my students were astounded. We have been studying man's impact on the environment, and the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and how manatees are an umbrella species. That by protecting them, you are also protecting many other species. They were shocked. Shocked! That somebody would ride a manatee. Granted, these same kids might have shot one and made jerky out of it. But they KNOW better than to ride one.*********************************************************I feel so empowered with my newfound knowledge.

According to Hick, the doctor said that if he still has a fever on Friday, he should not go to work. That's what he said. The doctor might just as well have told him, \"I've got gold fever. Come back every day because I want your insurance money.\" Hick is not the most reliable doctor's-instructions-relater.The most breathtaking of Hick's symptoms is the raspy, wheezy cough.

Since Hick has no stress while laying about the homestead, I discarded tension headache from my home diagnosis kit. When I found out that he HAS been drinking water like I suggested, to stay hydrated, but has only had one 12 oz. can of Diet Coke in the last 48 hours, I zeroed in on my current diagnosis. Caffeine withdrawal headache.Hick really needs to get over this. I am ready to sleep in my bed without fear of being sprayed with contaminants all the livelong night from his breather. The patient is mending too slowly. I feel it would not be proper to cover his head with the quilt when I go to bed. So I cover mine with a Coca Cola hand towel. I'll let you know how that works out for me.Something's gotta give. I am going deaf from the blaring of TV Land. Hick says he can't hear. It seems to me that Helen Keller herself would be able to hear from the vibrations emitted by that maxed-out volume.I wish Hick a speedy recovery. Just as long as I don't have to be near his exhale zone, or touch anything his Typhoid-Mary hands have touched.

The man who assumes every headache is a brain tumor, every sore throat a deadly case of epiglottitis, every stubbed toe a bout of gout, and every tummy pain an ectopic pregnancy. Okay. I might have exaggerated on that last one.I, on the other Germ-X-doused hand, do not see Hick at death's door. I see him huddled in his copper-colored 1980 Olds Toronado, crouching below window level, at dusk, parked out on the street beside a mailbox labeled \"The Deaths,\" peering into their picture window as they sit down at the dining room table, all resplendent in their hooded black robes, scythes leaned against the sideboard, ready to dig into a sumptuous feast, as Daddy Death says, \"Let's hope this time we aren't interrupted by a knock at the door.\" Yeah. Just like a Gary Larson cartoon in my old Far Side calendar.To hear Hick tell it, he was too sick today to properly unclog my kitchen sink that he said he unclogged Sunday afternoon. But he wasn't too sick to drive himself to town for a keg of NyQuil to drown his sorrows tonight. I say he might as well drink. Alcohol is probably healthier than NyQuil. I suggested that he go right to bed, because I can't draw out my bedtime until much past 2:00 a.m. I have work tomorrow, you know. And Hick may not. I figure if he goes to bed now, he'll be restless in the early morning hours, and I can sleep the sleep of the un-sprayed-upon-by-Hick's-breathing apparatus while Hick rests in the recliner.As Even Steven is my witness, I am going to ensure that Hick makes a miraculous recovery by Saturday. Even if it means that I have to do a basketful of good deeds in the next three days. The Pony and I are hiding out in the basement, washing our hands of Hick in more ways than one.

Do I want a tasteful black bow in my hair like Rose Marie? Perhaps a Rhoda Morgenstern head scarf? Some June Cleaver Pearls would be a nice touch. With a cashmere sweater that just happens to have been a gift, with a red dot on it. I could pair that sweater with a prairie skirt, the likes of which have not been seen since Caroline Ingalls went off the air. To step into a pair of Crocs would be too simple. I'm considering a sturdy pair of black basketball hightops like those worn by Mary Wickes in The Trouble With Angels.Or maybe I'll just do a full-on Mimi, like Kathy Kinney on the Drew Carey Show.I'm sure you'll all recognize me the minute I walk in. We'll be the family shoving each other to avoid walking through the door first. The Pony is the young man who won't look you in the eye or talk to you. He will duck his head and mumble before worming his way behind me.

We even have a library card for which we are ripped off $5.00 per person because we live outside the city limits. The problem is that there are no bookstores in Backroads.When I was a kid, and an adolescent, and a young adult, a couple of bookstores tried to keep their papery heads above water in the Backroads small business lagoon. I suppose my purchases of a couple books every other week were not enough to keep them afloat. When they went under for the third time and entered Davy Jones's locker, I graduated to chains like B. Dalton at South County Mall, and Waldenbooks just across Lindbergh. The Pony has had to make do with Scholastic book orders, and my Amazon acumen. He is missing the whole bookstore ambiance. I fear he might believe that books are found under cabbage leaves, or delivered by the stork. I think it behooves me to expose The Pony to this cultural experience.Add to my wacky Lucy-and-Ethel schemes a trip to The Book House on December 8th for a Chicken Soup signing by local authors. A foray fraught with more logistical machinations than the invasion of Normandy. Though the lure of a certain author with her magical butt encased in pajama jeans was strong, a visit to All on the Same Page was out. The Pony has his first high school academic meet at 9:00 a.m. I was not averse to a jaunt to St. Charles to drop by Main Street Books and, perhaps, partake of some gaming activities afterward. Alas, casinos are not Pony-friendly, and if his team gets knocked out of the smarts tournament early-on, The Pony has his bowling league at noon. So that left The Book House. Which looks perfectly charming and mysterious, if one is to judge a bookstore by its website.Not only is Crocs aficionado Sioux signing books at The Book House, but Donna Volkenannt, a latter-day Erma Bombeck, will be there as well. I am not familiar enough with Beth M. Wood to skewer her on this page, but I have read about her exploits on Sioux's blog. So there you have it. If Linda \"Eagle Eye\" O'Connell makes good with her comment threat to show up at that venue, I could kill four birds with one stone. WAIT! I'm not going to kill you! Really. There will be witnesses. And I'm not a very good stone thrower. Back-knifing is more my style. WAIT! I will be unarmed. I promise. Will any menfolk be present to entertain Hick? His favorite topics are goats, chickens, flea market finds, and fixing machines. He's not exactly a bibliophile.For anybody planning to invade my rural compound while I am way, let my forewarning forearm you. This means you, Publisher's Clearing House, student fundraiser beggars, Mormon missionaries, Jehovah's Witnesses bestowing gifts of The Watchtower, revenuers looking for a still down by Hick's creekside cabin, government operatives snooping into my conspiracy beliefs, and Wet Bandits. Genius will be home. Strapping seventeen-year-old Genius, who turns eighteen in less than two weeks. He is well-versed in paintball warfare. And he is sitting on Hick's lifetime arsenal of mostly legal weapons. Oh, and any of you thinking of nabbing him for a hefty ransom...his nickname (in my mind) is Red Chief. And he has expensive tastes.If the planets align, the biorhythms of the Thevictorian family all peak at the same time, and Even Steven is willing...I hope to see some of you at the The Book House on December 8th, between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m."}, {"title": "A One-Man Game of Telephone", "date": "Saturday, December 1, 2012", "text": "There are some people you would want in your enclave at the apocalypse.

The purpose being for Val to purchase a book or two, meet an online persona, and introduce The Pony to the world of retail tomes. No. Val would not use such flowery language on Hick. She would stick to the basics. \"Val go bookstore. You drive.\"Upon the re-tell to the boys, Hick could quite possibly say, \"Your mother is running away with a guy she met on the internet who owns a bookstore, and she wants ME to drive her there!\"I am worried that one day, Hick will come home and tell me that his doctor says he needs a hysterectomy."}, {"title": "Even Steven: A Stand-Up Guy", "date": "Friday, November 30, 2012", "text": "Even Steven toys with me.

It's not like they can set an alarm or a clock radio. It's not like the barking of three dogs just outside the French doors to their bedroom will wake them at 4:00 a.m. They can't have their mom call them to make sure they're up. So I'm guessing that they have some kind of system with a flashing light, perhaps. But what if they sleep with their head under the covers? Or what if they work night shift, and sleep during the day, and the room is already light? I mean, they've got it covered if they still live at home with hearing parents, or have a hearing spouse to wake them. I wish CBS would have shared a detail like that with us when Margie and Luke were contestants on The Amazing Race. I'm just worried about how the deaf can get a good night's sleep without fretting over getting to work on time.Then I started wondering about people with dog doors. Not about them getting to work on time. About why they have those dog doors. The ones for big dogs. Don't they have tremendous heating and cooling bills? What with that flap of door letting hot air in during the summer, and letting heated air out during the winter? Not to mention the danger of a toddler escaping at will. And how about the vermin that might get in? How does that doggie door know if it's letting in the family pet, or a possum, or a skunk, or Ferris Bueller's creepy principal, Ed Rooney, or a Wet Bandit like Joe Pesci in Home Alone? I just want people with dog doors to be safe and energy-efficient.Then I started wondering why people buy those little packs of eyeglasses screws and little screwdrivers in the check-out line. Because if their glasses have lost a screw, how in the world do they think they will be able to see to put the new screw in the glasses without wearing their glasses? Sure, they can have the glasses on to pick out a screw and the cute little screwdriver and have them ready. But then they have to take the glasses off their face in order to put the screw in, and that must be nigh on impossible for a bifocaled person to accomplish. I just want people to be able to see, and have glasses in good repair.Then my alarm went off and my three dogs stopped yapping until the minute I sat down in the upstairs recliner for my morning chair nap after taking my shower to get ready for work."}, {"title": "The Throbbing", "date": "Wednesday, November 28, 2012", "text": "Sorry.

I am breathed on by the teeming student populace on a daily basis. It could be anything. The Pony had a headache Monday night into Tuesday morning. He doesn't breathe on me too much. But he paws at the remote control. I know that. So I don't go touching anywhere on my face after handling it after he does. It could be anything.One thing it could be is a broken neck. Okay. That's a little far-fetched. But the stabbing pain started last night at midnight, when I woke up in my recliner in front of the big-screen. One minute I was watching Chopped, waiting to see who won the round with the Cornish game hens, or little chickens, as Frank Costanza might say, just before asking who's having sex with the hen, and the next minute I was trying to keep my head from splitting open. It seems that I was not properly positioned for my chair nap. My neck was askew. It throbbed like the sinuses above my eyes.I could not believe I was nearly done in by my loyal recliner.

One more time, and it's off to the glue factory for him, by cracky!This day was a miserable study in pain. Had I plans at school good enough for a sub to follow, I would have used a sick day. However, typing up sub plans would have been more painful than enduring the everyday routine. And I was already at school. Besides, I had duty this morning, and duty this afternoon.By nine-thirty, I had popped an aspirin. At eleven-thirty, Acetaminophen joined Aspirin in Stomach Lake. And as soon as three-thirty rolled around, Ibuprofen arrived late to the gastric swim party. This throbbing noggin is accompanied by shooting pains down the back of my neck. I'm not sure which came first. But they are a darnable duo. Darn them! Darn them all to heck! I like a good Charlton Heston quote every now and then, too.Nothing is working out for me. I went to fill my giant Bubba cup with ice from my Frigidaire ice-maker, and two chunks popped out. One landed on my Croc before skittering across the kitchen floor.

Seriously, people. Disposable handcuffs made of plastic? I'm checking out space in the industrial park for my proposed handbasket factory.The cheese in question was last observed on the second shelf of my shiny silver Frigidaire. Frig, for short. Two eight-ounce bars of sharp cheddar, still in their original see-through plastic packaging, had resided on the far-right side of that glass shelf for approximately two weeks. Like stalwart soldiers they stood, on edge, awaiting a call to duty.Yesterday morning, as I gazed at the cheese, I noticed that it was gazing back at me. \"Oh, Val!\" you might say. \"You're so silly! Cheese does not have eyes.\" This cheese did. Green eyes. Not full of envy, but full of mold. That is SO not cool. Sharp cheddar should be dark yellow. Not dark yellow with forest green spots, like some wacky leopard all decked out for St. Patrick's day. And speaking of St. Patrick's Day...See there, how good I am with a segue? Not the motorized riding-on kind spelled Segway, but the ol' switcheroo from one subject to another totally unrelated subject. Sometimes I really impress myself with my mad segue skillz. In my mind, I could totally write copy for the local newscasters.St. Patrick's Day is\u00a0 around the expiration date of 3-13-13 that was stamped on my cheese packages. I cry shenanigans! That cheese should have been good to go for another three-and-a-half months! And remember, the expiration date is the recommended date that you use the product by for maximum freshness. Not the date that it will kill you if you eat it. I had a good mind to take that cheese back to Save A Lot. But of course I didn't have the receipt. I'm not in a habit of keeping food receipts in case the food spoils three-and-a-half months before the expiration date. I'm sure they would have given me my money back at that store. They are quite friendly and customer-oriented. After all these years, this is only the second time I've had a problem with something I bought there. The first was some chicken that went bad before the date. When I mentioned it on my next trip, the check-out lady told me I should have brought it back for a refund, but I had already thrown it away. That was chicken. We're talking a day or two, tops. Not three-and-a-half months.What's the deal? I bought the cheese and drove it ten minutes home and put it in Frig. It's not like I ripped off the packaging, rubbed it on my rump, drop-kicked it across the goat pen, rolled it end over end through the chicken house, called the dog to fetch it by mouth back to the house, used it to scrub under the rim of the toilet, and had Hick carry it under his armpits for two days before re-wrapping it and putting it on the second shelf of Frig. C'mon! People in Morocco, including a visiting Andrew Zimmern, eat khlea, which is fermented meat stored in its own fat. Not refrigerated. And it does not grow mold!I know that cheese is made from mold. But that should be on the outside of the thick rind, or branching merrily through the cheese proper in veins that are a planned part of the cheese texture and taste. Not growing in ever-expanding circles on the surface of a storebought cheese brick.You bet I moved my cheese. Right to the plastic trash bag.

Apparently, the proper way to cool off if you are too hot is not to tell the hostess so she can adjust her thermostat, nor take off your long-sleeved zipper-neck sweater and wear just your T-shirt, nor fan yourself with a styrofoam tray. The solution is to open the kitchen window, struggle with the locked storm window, switch to the next window, and fling it up so cold air rushes through the screen.9.

You missed a breathtaking Day Before Thanksgiving Potluck Lunch. But not to worry--I will bring that DBTPL to you.I'm sure you are picturing Val and her colleagues dressed in their Thanksgiving finery, gathered around one long table made of many, said table draped with a linen tablecloth, featuring a centerpiece of steaming pumpkin soup in an actual pumpkin tureen, the handle of a carved-gourd ladle elegantly curling over the side, orange and yellow candles providing ambiance as we join hands and give thanks for the feast set before us by the FACS teacher and her minions.This is where the screech of a needle across a phonograph record jars you back to reality. So much for listening to that Charlie Brown theme music.We trickled into the teacher workroom to fill our paper plates. The FACS room had been commandeered by the FACS teacher (the very nerve of her!) to hold class. Since she became our go-to gal for turkey procurement, we forgave her. Dress on this special day is best described as informal. Our spread lay sprawled upon the counter between the stainless steel sink and the cardboard cubbyhole slots that house the vital forms and receive the ISS assignments. Candles would have been a nice touch, because one of the overhead fluorescents had gone kaput. The soft glow of the soda machine almost made up for it.Kyocera stood against the opposite wall, jutting out Drawer 1 like a delinquent with a chip on his shoulder. His longtime companion, Canon, was not himself, having been dismantled yesterday when a repairman cannibalized him for his top parts, so necessary to the convalescence of the office Canon. These vital organs are no longer being donated by dying copiers, nor synthesized in mad-scientist laboratories. Such is the state of copier health care in Backroads.At the head of our buffet sat the turkey, light and dark. I took a tad of each, the white meat being a mistake, what with turning out to be virtually inedible, even after removing a ropey vein and trying to cut through shiny cartilage with a white plastic fork and spoon. Cold mashed potatoes were next. No flavoring. No butter. Perhaps no potato. On to the Hot Wing Dip. It's a school potluck favorite of mine. Luckily the chicken in it replaced my turkey protein. I snagged a hot roll cold from the cardboard box, to sop up my HWD. I passed up the broccoli stems in cheese sauce, the stuffing, the gravy, the boiled shrimp, the green bean casserole, the corn casserole, the deer sausage with Ritz crackers. On to the dessert counter, under the window next to the laminator. I forwent the apple dumplings, the chocolate pudding pie, and the triple-chocolate cake, going straight to my Mississippi Mud cake that I bought at Country Mart. Which nearly caused a rumble.A kind, caring soul, do-gooding her way around the venue, took it upon herself to slice all desserts. She meant well. Thought she was providing a vital service, you know, because we were in a hurry, and no knives were in evidence. Goody Soul had found one plastic knife. She popped the tops off the desserts and commenced to cuttin'. I told her I would be having a piece of the Mississippi Mud. Goody Soul kindly carved a section to my liking. \"I just washed my hands,\" she said, before holding the top of my cake slice with four fingers to keep it on the knife. That stuff doesn't bother me. I'm sure she's clean enough. It was what I discovered later that bothered me.At the end of the half day, I saw people fetching their leftovers and scurrying to their cars. I went in to grab my cake. I worked hard walking into the store to slide my debit card and buy it. There it sat. Just where I'd left it some two hours earlier. One slice gone. And twelve slices remaining. Do you get what I'm getting at? I can hardly re-bring that mutilated baked good to my mom's Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday. Goody Soul had sliced the entire cake. Let me spell it out for you, in case physics is not your first language. My storeboughten cake, which would have had two surface areas exposed from my cut-out slice, now had twenty-four surface areas exposed. Surface areas receptive to receiving airborne contaminants. Surface areas eager to evaporate their internal moisture. AND the number of pieces meant that Goody Soul had not even been symmetrical in her slicing. She gave me one piece, then cut twelve more. Thirteen pieces from one cake.That's gotta be a goocher somewhere."}, {"title": "How Do You Know...", "date": "Tuesday, November 20, 2012", "text": "How do you know if Hick has taken a week off from work?No. The answer is NOT, \"Your garbage can is empty, and your dog is pregnant.\" That's how you know if a Frenchman has been in your back yard. Hey, now! Don't be hatin' on me, you of the French persuasion. I am only plagiarizing Stephen King.You know that Hick has taken a week off from work when he wets your pants. It's true. Don't you hate it when that happens? When you come home from a hard day in the classroom, eager to slip into something more comfortable, only to discover that you've slipped into something LESS comfortable?I have a favorite pair of dark blue cotton sweatpants that I wear around the house. They're relatively new. I had to draft a replacement for my old gray pair with the purple stripe, due to a rather large hole down the outside of the right leg. I quickly tired of giving free peep shows and grasping the onion-skin-paper-thin edges of that purple stripe. I drape my blue sweatpants over the edge of the forest green triangle garden tub in our master bathroom. They faithfully wait for me from 6:30 a.m. until 5:00 p.m.I see no reason to hang my sweatpants on a hanger. They're SWEATPANTS, by cracky! Nor am I compelled to fold them and put them in a drawer. And I'm too much of a proper lady to kick them in a pile and leave them on the bathroom floor. So they hang on the side of the tub. It's not like Hick is going to be hosting Queen Elizabeth II for high tea while I'm away minding freshmen who say clever things like, \"Feel my butt.\" He doesn't even know how to make cucumber sandwiches. And I'm pretty sure Publishers Clearing House will not barge in with their cameras. Likewise, Geraldo Rivera will not be broadcasting a special during which he will unseal the storage panels that enclose the tub. I'm pretty sure those sweatpants are not going to cause any harm in their intermediate resting place while I'm at work.Our reunion each evening is joyous. Not me and Hick. Me and my sweatpants. Hick wasn't even home Monday evening. I would have brushed past him anyway, in a beeline for my comfy loungewear. I was stoked. Tossed my work pants into the walk-in closet. Reached for the seat of my pants. And found nothing. They were not where I had left them. They had jumped over the ceramic-tile-road to the toilet, and hung themselves upon my towel rack. My pants were cohabiting with my towel. The secret life of linens. Who knew?I hopped into those dear saggy sweatpants faster than the Easter Bunny fills baskets and hides eggs on Easter morn. My pants did not feel quite right. It must have been...oh...I don't know...perhaps...THE GALLON OF WATER THEY WERE RETAINING like a premenstrual circus fat lady on a high-salt diet. I felt like a toddler in a morning Pull-Up. What a fine how-do-you-do THIS was for the gal who brings home the bacon.I left them on. But I stopped short of trying to make The Water Pants happen. I'm no Gretchen Wieners. Even though my pants looked mighty FETCH. I knew, deep in my heart, that my soggy sweatpants were never going to become the new Water Bra. Duh! You wear them on your butt and legs, not on your boobs.Since Hick was not at home for inquisition and chastisement purposes, I could only guess the method to his madness. It looked like he had undertaken some project with the garden tub. Not wiping all three sides to make it shine. Not cleaning the interior. More subtle. Churning vinegar through the jets, perhaps. Though I did not check to see if my vinegar was missing, and the house did not smell like egg-dying gone awry. Apparently, Hick had taken umbrage to the sight of my sweatpants on the side of the tub, neither sweating nor panting, as he went about his task. So he hung them on my towel rack. On top of my morning shower towel. Which had wiped me down like an ultra-efficient squeegee, its nubby nubbins thirstily imbibing the droplets of well-water from my rather large expanse of epidermis.Hick is very lucky that no chafing ensued."}, {"title": "Who's Bringing the Roast Beast?", "date": "Monday, November 19, 2012", "text": "We have a sign-up sheet in the teacher workroom. A list of who's bringing what to the Thanksgiving potluck lunch on Wednesday. You know, because everybody is simply dying to cook up a tasty treat on the night before they have to cook up a bunch of tasty treats. The timing is off a bit this year, what with a switch in personnel, and our regular turkey-cooker out of the rotation. The pinch-getter volunteered to procure the turkey. The least we can do is provide a covered dish as requested.Therein lies the problem. Like \"aloha\" in Hawaii, \"covered dish\" in our building has more than one meaning. Or so it would seem upon perusal of the sign-up sheet. But before I give you a peek at what's on the menu, let's make excuses for the signers. And also for the Johns whose Hancocks are sorely lacking.We normally have that potluck today. Monday of the short week. In years past, we have had leftovers on Tuesday and Wednesday. More recently, the bird carcass is picked clean before Tuesday rolls around. A hearty lunch of corn casserole, veggies and dip, and sugar-free desserts are left. So changing the day is not such a big deal anymore. We'll stuff ourselves on Wednesday, and clean up the mess. No lingering lesser babkas to be picked over for two days.That sign-up list used to be on the back of the door in the teacher workroom. Which is unfortunate, because the door is always propped open. So you really had to search to find the list. In days gone by, people tried to haul in a balanced meal. To not bring what others had already signed up for. As luck would have it, the first signer was usually the Loaf of Bread Guy. You could mark that off your list right away. Now the sign-up paper is on the table by the soda machine. I only found it because I sat down to rest while Kyocera was churning out my copies.I'm giving my colleagues the benefit of the doubt. They probably thought we weren't having our potluck this year. Or they didn't find the list. But the reality remains. It is Monday. The potluck is Wednesday. Only ten people have signed up. Here's what we're having. Read it, and weep with me.rollshot wing dip?chocolate cakegreen bean casserolesomethingMississippi Mud cakedessertapple dumplingsFarmer's AlmanacOkay. That last one is a guess. Lady of Spain, we adore you. Your writing is beautiful, so stylish, with curlicues and loop-de-loops, yet unreadable. I know you are writing in English, because there are no beginning questions marks, and no funky upside-down exclamation points. I am sure you're bringing something delicious. But the best I can decipher is Farmer's Almanac. Please forgive my monolingualism.I'm not all that concerned about filling my gullet at Wednesday's brought-in buffet. I could easily spend 39 days on Survivor, all the while giving my share of rice to one of those little skeletal girls without ever feeling the bite of hunger. Besides, school dismisses at 1:00 that day. I can grab some gas station chicken on the way home if I feel a mite peckish. Such a meager menu does not cause me undue alarm.

Except maybe they are, because it's not like the Rams are setting the league on fire with their performance this year. Even though it's already better than last year.

I think they've had it in for me since I closed my savings account and took my fortune elsewhere. There. I said it. I suspect retaliation for de-monetation. I can't even remember the reason, now. I think it had something to do with charging a fee if I made two or more deposits or withdrawals a month.Fie on you, Bank Branch! If it's MY money, you should not have a say in how often I need to use it or grow it. It's not like I was draining the account, then re-opening another to get a fancy gift. Nor was I withdrawing huge chunks to buy run-down properties and flip them. So I took it out. The money. Not IT. Who do you think I am, a date of Jerry's friend Elaine? Unlike Elaine's anatomically-correct date, I explained why I was taking it out.Okay, that one may be a bit far-fetched for a conspiracy theory. I'm sure it was a simple policy change that affected everybody with a savings account like mine. But I'm not here to dwell in the past. I took action when I was dissatisfied. Don't make me do it again, Bank Branch.HERE'S THE BONE OF CONTENTION.Hick was issued a reimbursement check for the bills he paid with his credit card for the business trip last week to Massachusetts. This involved airline tickets, housing, and food for three workers for five days. A hefty sum on a personal credit card. Upper four figures. We pay off our card every month, so I wanted to make sure the money was in the checking account. Normally, Hick's payroll check is directly deposited. But reimbursement checks are issued on paper. I took it to the Bank Branch for deposit on my way to the doctor's office on Thursday.The teller girl looked at the check like it was a gossamer fairy wing. A unicorn horn nub. Bigfoot's ingrown toenail. You'd think she had never seen a paper check. That she had gone straight from Ron Moody as Fagin with his drawstring bag of coins in OLIVER! to electronic transfers. In three seconds flat. \"Is this a payroll check?\"\"No. That is done by direct deposit every month. This is from the same company, though. It's a reimbursement check.\" Let the record show that Hick had signed the back. That I had written FOR DEPOSIT under his signature. That I submitted it with a printed deposit slip bearing our name and account number. And that we have banked there for twenty-three years.\"There is probably going to be a ten-day hold on these funds.\"This would not cause us undue hardship, because the institution where I now stash our cash has no limit on withdrawals and deposits. I could take out money to pay off the card, and put it back when the reimbursement funds were available. An inconvenience. But not a hardship. It's the principle of the matter.THEY WOULD HAVE CASHED IT OUTRIGHT. Uh huh. Even the guy behind me, who stepped to the next teller girl, knew this loophole. As my drama in real life was playing out, I heard him say, \"I want to cash this check. Then I'm going to deposit the cash into my account. The girl last time told me that would avoid the hold.\"I looked at Teller Girl and raised my left eyebrow. The students call it The Stinkeye. She excused herself to go ask somebody important, who was in a glass-walled office discussing a home loan, making comments like, \"I've never heard of that kind of loan. We can give it a try.\"After five minutes, Teller Girl came back. \"There won't be a hold. She signed off on it.\" Hmpf! I should say so. You would think that twenty-three years with no overdrafts would account for something. Last December, we went through the ten-day hold with the Christmas bonus. That's a Christmas bonus. Not an After The First Of The Year bonus.I've a good mind to keep our money in an old sock buried in the back yard. The interest earned would be about the same.

How they are different from Egyptian mummies like King Tut, and modern-day mummies like Kim Il-Sung. A student new to our school this year raised her hand. \"At my old school? We made our own mummies out of chickens. We wrapped them and buried them in the yard. I don't know why they were teaching us how to make mummies.\"\"Chicken parts? Or a whole chicken?\" I was curious. Because at my old school, I taught the kids how to dissect a chicken wing. It's just like the human arm, you know. They're homologous structures. The part of the chicken wing that most people avoid has two bones like the radius and ulna in your forearm. The icky part you throw away is like your hand and fingers. The meaty part we like to eat is like your bicep muscle. You can put a dull probe under a tendon in that upper chicken wing, and make the bottom part move, like your bicep moves your forearm when you flex it. Coincidentally, my students declared that they would never eat chicken wings again.\"We mummified the whole chicken.\"\"Are there plans to dig them up?\"\"I don't know.\"\"Because, I wonder what the point would be, just to bury them, and never look at them again.\"\"I know. If somebody finds all those mummified chickens, they're going to think something weird was going on.\"Maybe a Missouri teacher of the lower grades can fill me in. Is this come kind of GLE objective? I remember The Pony learning an awful lot about mummies in one of his classes. But then again, The Pony loves all things Egyptian. So he might have picked up some knowledge elsewhere, and elaborated when discussing what he was doing at school that week.I'm all for hands-on learning. But I draw the line at having my students make mummies. Besides, it's not part of my CLEs that will be tested on the EOC next spring.

Unlike the packages left stacked neatly on top of the generator by the UPS lady, a friend to dogs everywhere, with her fistful of crunchy treats to toss will-nilly for the fleabags...packages left by Mr. FedEx are found on the floor right inside the garage door.

But Genius has been to the BigCity by himself, so I let out the apron strings a bit.I didn't even command Genius to call me when he got there, and when he was leaving. The Pony and I scurried around so he could feed the goats and chickens. Then I took him back to town so he could spend the night with his grandma. Hick was still in Massachusetts.

We are out of the movie, but we can't get on the road. The police have it blocked.

Don't let anybody take advantage of you.\"\"You're crazy. We don't look country. We're fine.\"\"Just be careful. Call me back in twenty minutes, or when you are leaving.\"Yes. I'm overprotective. But Genius is naive. He will object when he reads this. But it's true. When I worked in the BigCity for the unemployment office, down by the Bevo Mill, a coworker said the same thing to me. Hick worked near Tower Grove and Chouteau at the time. So we rode together. He had to be at work at 7:00 a.m. My supervisor didn't show up until around 7:20 to open the building. I told Hick to let me out so I could wait. I never thought anything of it. There were not many people around at that time of morning. Just those driving by on the way to work. Hick picked me up after work. We both had overtime back then. My supervisor assigned me extra filing to pass the time. When he left, I was sometimes alone for a half hour until Hick was ready to go. At least I could wait inside the office. The door locked on its own when I left. The only time I got scared was when a guy walked from narrow window to narrow window, pressing his face against the glass, watching me. I went to the windowless break room to spoil his fun. Still, I felt safer with this arrangement than dropping off Hick and picking him up later.The phone rang again at 7:15. \"Mom. We're leaving now.\"\"From the parking lot?\"\"Yeah.

They go way back, she being an upper-level mathematics instructor with the claim to fame of shaking Wernher von Braun's hand in her childhood. She was supposed to seal her recommendation in a separate envelope, then pass the packet on to the last person, the official-transcript-adder. And herein lies today's tale: Example Number 179 of How the Universe Conspires Against Val.For anonymity purposes, we shall call the recommendation-writer Julia. As in Sugarbaker. For reasons which will become apparent a bit farther down the page. The official-transcript-adder shall be known as OTA. Try to keep up.Julia schlepped the ever-fattening packet up the long hall to OTA's office. She proudly, and with a flourish, I imagine, presented the pile of documents to OTA. Julia is a staunch supporter of Genius, declaring him to be, if not one-in-a-million, at least one-in-five-in-her-career. As in the top echelon of students she has had the pleasure of teaching in her thirty-some-odd years of education.OTA inspected the scholarship instructions. Not because she didn't trust Genius and Julia to be thorough, but because it's kind of her job. Like a quality control inspector, rather than the last worker on the assembly line. She thumbed her way through the stack of documents. \"Essay? Has somebody proofread this for him?\"Julia nodded. \"His mother checked it over last night.\"OTA raised her eyebrows. \"His mother? Why did he have his mother look at it instead of his honors English teacher? Or me?\"Julia drew herself up to maximum height, in order to look down her nose at OTA. \"His mother is an accomplished writer. She writes every day. She has received an offer of publication. She has won several writing contests. I'm not positive, but I believe she's writing a book. AND, she was valedictorian of her high school class. So I would think that her proofreading would be sufficient.\"OTA blinked. \"Well. I nod and speak to her in the hall when I walk by. But I had no idea she was so accomplished. I'm sure his essay will be fine.\"I know all of this, because Julia ran straight to my classroom to inform me. I'm pretty sure flames were still shooting from her nostrils. We share a prep hour. They're not really for prepping lessons, you know. They're for gossiping. Julia is also a staunch supporter of me. She wanted me to know that she has my back. Any place. Any time. Whenever somebody disparages my intellectual capabilities.I bear OTA no ill will. She is merely one of many who judge this book by its cover. I am like Chris Farley's Bennett Brauer character with finger-quotes at SNL's Weekend Update desk. Maybe I'm not \"conventionally pretty\" or \"smart-looking\" or \"well-spoken\" or \"one of the popular crowd\" or \"dressed for success\" or \"able to not blend in with the woodwork\" or...well...OTA is not the first person to underestimate Val Thevictorian.Let the record show that we are a small school district. One long hallway is the extent of our building. No multi-acre campus. One. Building. Three teachers per academic department. I have been with this district since the year The Pony was born. You'd think I might be more than a one-dimensional character. Like one of those stick drawings on the back windshield of a Ford pickup, a wild-haired little boy peeing on a Chevy emblem. At least I did not receive the Dean Wormer speech: \"Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, son.\" That's because I am not a drunk. And not a son.Apparently, the universe has other plans for Val. Plans which do not yet include respect from her peers.****************************************************Because Karma has been teething on my posterior recently, I fully expect a plethora of typos to escape my attention in this post.

They are selfless like that. Always willing to help out a gal named Val struggling with Karmatic payback. Who knew that Stephen was well-versed in the everyday uses of lamb's blood? Not this chick. And there's Sioux, who touts the power of a not-so-clandestine group called the WWWPs.I don't mean to brush off their helpful hints. But it seems that finding a virgin here in Backroads, and a volcano to toss her into, would be more practical. Since I'm a logical kind of troubleshooter, I will consider the cons of each solution. What? What about the pros? I'm also a pessimistic kind of troubleshooter.I think Stephen's antidote is the safer of these two divergent paths. C'mon! Who wouldn't rather slaughter a lamb (or wave about a frozen lamb chop) than face a group of not-quite-spring-chickens cackling over Big Os and tall tales? All you really need is a knife. And a lamb. Or maybe just the lamb. It could trip while frolicking, and skin its woolly knee, and VOILA! Lamb's blood! Free for the taking. Without the guilt. You might even be able to find the stuff on eBay. Left over from a Red Cross lamb's blood drive. If you're discreet, PETA might not get wind of it for a long time.Sioux's proposition of a sortie to the BigCity to consort with WWWPs is more fraught with danger than the notion of walking into a classroom full of freshmen without a lesson plan. I quiver with fright from the contemplation alone.First of all, there would be that issue of hiring excavators to remove a wall of my basement to free me for the trip. Then trying to keep the media away while I'm hoisted onto the flatbed truck borrowed from Sea World and driven cross country just for my benefit.Say, hypothetically, that I arrive at the venue for the aforementioned book signing. What if everybody else is wearing pajama jeans? And Val has none? There they'd be, those WWWPs, lolling about, killing time between autographs by passing around bits of novel like tasty hors d'oeuvres upon a silver platter. And I'm not talkin' pizza snacks, those tiny slices of rye bread topped with a filling of sausage and melted mozzarella like my sister learned to make in junior high home ec. Nor a spritz of Cheez Whiz on a Ritz. There might even be poetry in that venue that didn't plagiarize The Raven.Anything could happen at such a book signing. I might find myself dodging inopportune streams of impromptu lactation from one of the authors. It can recur, you know, years after the baby has gone off to college. It's true! I read it on the internet. And what if somebody pulled a chair out from under me? Or tried to jam my head up under the faucet in the bathroom sink, under the guise giving me a free shampoo, and then left me there, without even putting in a courtesy call to the local calendar-model firemen? Or I was asphyxiated by uncontrollable bursts of flatulence? What if I was used as the target for a newly-patented game of Purse Shoots the Girdle.

Karma has wasted no time in exacting retribution. Evened the Steven that very day, in fact. For though I was indeed entitled to my sick day for a medical procedure, Karma failed to concur.The very sick day I was going about my merry way, feeling fine, sporting an unsightly hematoma the size of a Kennedy half dollar on the inside of my right elbow, Karma flexed her maw. Took a Jaws-like chomp on my ample behind. Made sure that a sick day was used for sickness. Or painful accidental injury.It was like some creepy Final Destination movie. No matter what steps I might have taken to avoid my destiny, Karma would even the score. There I was last evening, happy as a clam in a blue recliner in front of a basement big-screen TV, when Karma struck. I had just picked up one of the 1503 mail-order catalogs that a carrier from the dead-mouse-smelling post office had crammed into my makeshift metal-pipe mailbox earlier in the day. Because those mail-order companies don't want people along the mail chain-of-command shopping willy-nilly in random catalogs, they seal the top and bottom with two clear circles of stickiness that must be severed in order to turn the pages. I have a habit of slipping a finger inside the pages, and poking at those sticky circles like a blunt, fleshy letter-opener.I had three sticky circles severed. I was on the last one when Karma took her bite. Like a piranha she was. Forget the fleshy buttocks. She went right for the jugular of my finger-webbing. The base of my right badfinger, where it joins forces with my pointer. YEEOUCH! I think I heard the slicing sound. Like a paper cutter blade slashing through construction paper. Blood oozed out. You'd think there would have been a shortage, after the leak from my median cubital vein forming the newest Great Lake, which I have named Lake Elbowio, just under the surface of my translucent old-lady skin. I hollered to Genius, who was flitting around with some photographs he had taken, printing them for wallpapering his room. \"EEWWW!\" So much for sympathy. I staunched the effluence with a tissue.Flash to the future. Today. Did you know that a paper cut can be reopened when you are doing the good deed of carrying a Popular Photography magazine to your son's room? And that while you notice the pain, you are a tough old bird, and may not notice the seepage until you are on your way to town to grab a 44 oz. Diet Coke. And furthermore, did you know that Karma will rub salt in your wound under the guise of Germ-X while you are doing the good deed of cleaning up that bodily fluid before entering a business establishment? Note to Self: Germ-X in a paper cut hurts like a...like Germ-X in a paper cut.But back to yesterday's sick day. Karma wasn't through with me yet. She took my crown.

I might get the whistleblower treatment.This expos\u00e9 will knock your socks off. People will be running willy-nilly through the streets, sockless, leaving their shoes off rather than risk an embarrassing case of stinkfoot, subjecting their pinky-toes to accidental amputation by streetsweepers. It's that big.But first...Yes. I AM a fan of Julie Chen on Big Brother. She really knows how to delay gratification with her BUT FIRSTs. So I am following in her footsteps, short of marrying a network head, to further the suspense. I will divulge this dastardly deed of skullduggery momentarily. But first...you must bask in my backstory.I took a sick day from work to have some lab work done. Don't worry about my earning power. I currently have accrued 109 sick days. Make that 108. Any days over 100 left at the end of the school year will disappear. Gone are my days of scheduling lab work after school, muddling through the day without eating or drinking for a fasting blood test. I'll take my benefits now, thank you very much. A sick day for which I will be compensated twenty dollars upon leaving the district. A sick day for which the substitute is paid seventy-five dollars. So even cashing out one hundred sick days at the end of my career, I have saved the district a tidy sum of five thousand, five hundred dollars. Kudos to me. I don't expect a thank you note.Due to price gouging in the insurance business, we seem to change providers or policies each year. The current carrier requires that lab work be sent to one specific provider. Countless employees have had problems with blood draws at doctors' offices and hospital labs. But there is ONE outpatient lab in our county that will send the specimen out correctly, and save the individual from paying a hundred seventy dollars for a routine blood test.That's not the reveal.The preferred-provider phlebotomist prepped my inner-elbow for the needle. \"Have you been fasting?\"\"Yes. Since seven o'clock last night. I didn't even take my medicine this morning.\"\"Oh, you should always take your medicine.\"\"Well, I have it out in the car. For when I'm done here.\"\"Do you have good veins? I hope you've been drinking a lot of water.\"\"Wait. What? I'm not supposed to drink water. That's what they always tell me when they give me the lab order. 'It's a fasting blood draw. No food or drink for twelve hours before the test.' Sometimes they say just a sip of water with medicine that you can't put off that long.\"\"Oh, no. We WANT you to drink water. So your vein won't blow. No matter how careful we are, these collection vials are vacuum tubes. You can get a blown vein. It's painful, and it messes up your vein for future blood draws.\"So there you have it. YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE WATER YOU WANT BEFORE A FASTING BLOOD DRAW! Straight from the phlebotomist's mouth.You're welcome. I have risked persona-non-grataness with the medical establishment to bring you this vital information.

His company bought out a factory there, so he is coordinating the move of a multitude of machines. Hick is good with that stuff. He knows how to take it apart and put it back together. With a minimum of leftover parts.Tonight he called to report that he spent $20 on a coat. \"I had to,\" Hick said. \"It's snowing here. And I have to load the truck all day tomorrow.\" Lest you think I begrudge him $20 for a coat, a HEAVY coat, as he informed me, I do not. It's just that he has a penchant for using the debit card and neglecting to show me receipts. So each week when I call the bank's automated number to keep track of checking account expenditures, I am left with several mystery purchases. All of which mystify Hick. Making me think we're being scammed by some minimum-wage Lowe's clerk after Hick uses the card. Just last week there were three unknown charges. Upon a severe poking with a sharp stick--I mean, a round of questioning under a bare lightbulb, Hick remembered that he had used the debit card at the pharmacy for extra medication to take on his trip, at a sporting goods store to purchase ammunition, and for a fifty-dollar charge for something to do with the airport.

I am the one who trains people at work, to certify them for the forklift. He said, 'Well, you DID drive it forwards down the aisle, when you should have been going backwards.' And I told him, yeah, but I turned it around as soon as you asked me to. He agreed that I did. But he STILL wanted to see my license. Can you believe that?

But seriously...It is difficult for me to vote in the early morning hours before work, because my polling place is in the opposite direction from my job. Ninth-graders wait for no woman, so it wouldn't do for me to be late because I got tied up in the voting booth. Not literally tied up. I'm sure that would count as some untoward type of kinky voter intimidation. Please excuse me for taking liberties with the word \"booth\". It is more like a flip-down diaper-changing table at my polling place. No sides to speak of. You're airing out your stinky baby's butt of a ballot for all inappropriate gawkers to see.I vote in a little country church. I don't know the denomination, or any of the parishioners. It's an old rock building. Voting is in the basement, where smells of phantom church socials linger. Oops! That's the aroma of today's cooking for the old ladies manning the voter rolls. The rustic chapel resides six miles outside town. I don't know how many people are expected to Garmin their way to the middle of nowhere to vote. But an old-fashioned revival could not have filled that church to the gills like this election. The Pony and I had to stable the Tahoe in overflow parking. That's a side lot, almost gravel, on the upper end of the churchyard.Hopefully, all voters were able-bodied. Because upon entering, one must hike down four uneven carpeted steps. A long table of mature women sit behind the voter registration books. I'm not sure if it's required by law, but everybody always hands over a driver's license to the book biddies. They page through the tomes of A-F, and G-L, and so on, depending on your last name. I was pleased to see that Hick had a big yellow sticker covering his name, with the legend ABSENTEE BALLOT over his sign-in space. That's because Hick voted Saturday, and is now cooling his steel-toed heels in Leominster, Massachusetts, on a workation from his job. No voter fraud here in Backroads.After signing in with a red pen, I was shuffled along the table to another eldster who handed me a ballot. That's it. No instructions. She might as well have shoved a baby bird from the nest to fly or die. In past years, we've had an electronic machine or two. Not this time. But we had a lot of round tables, suitable for a poker tournament. Or perhaps not, depending on the religious affiliation of the churchmembers.I wove my way through the close-proximitied tables, to one with just a man and his grandson. The seven-or-so-year-old occasionally asked Grampy a question. \"Do you have to pay to vote? Is it true that if So-And-So is elected, he will make school three hours a day? That's what I heard at school.\" Most people sat at the tables. Only a couple used one of the three baby-changers. It was hard work filling in the ovals with a BIC black pen. The after-work rush started as I was finishing. A lady plopped at my table, blocking my way out of the voter's maze. I looked like Ms. PacMan trying to find an alternate route. I resisted making that dying sound when a strapping eighteen-year-old first-time voter refused to yield to me at the narrow escape slot. Kids these days. They don't realize that the elderly have the right-of-way.The fellow elderly, though, know where it's at. A gentleman motioned for me to go ahead of him at the ballot-eater. The shredder-looking machine that you feed your own ballot into. I was skeptical. I couldn't take time to read the directions with people lining up behind me. Besides, they might have been looking at my ballot. I was not going to be the one charged with inciting a rumpus in a church basement. No sirree Bob!

October 31st.\"\"It's my son's scholarship application.\" Postal Quirk did not even dignify that with a response. Like mothers brought him scholarship applications that could decide the future of their first-born sons all day, every day. He printed the sticker and stuck it on. Without even measuring the distance from the top and side of the envelope! Just slapped it on there, all willy-nilly, not caring whether or not it was geometrically correct! We're talkin' about a scholarship application to Missouri S&T here. Not a portfolio to the Picasso Institute of Matchbook Cover Art! An engineering school. Where precision is a virtue.Furthermore, Postal Quirk tossed that envelope sideways into a gray plastic tub. Rather than carrying it on a red velvet pillow to the back of the mail truck and securing it with a special Velcro seatbelt made just for scholarship applications to Missouri S&T.Genius did not grasp the gravity of this situation. He thinks of S&T as his fall-back choice. His safety school. I look at it as MY number one choice.

Not that I was after a Dr. Pepper, mind you. We all know that Diet Coke is my dark master. But I was elated with anticipation. I only partake of the magical elixir on weekends during the school year.As luck would have it, another customer had arrived in Cokeland afore me. So I did what any sensible adult would do, and stood back a few feet from the soda bar. Stood right there by the pyramid of the beer of the week, patiently waiting my turn.

Three pieces of said ice observing me insouciantly from where they rested on the terra cotta tile. \"There's no way I could hit you on the head with a piece of ice!\" declared Soda Dude. As a square popped over the gap at the top of the soda dispenser, which has not fit properly in that custom-made space since they replaced it two months ago.\"Don't worry.

Just before they snarl and gnash their teeth until one winner emerges and the other two cower in submission. I did not meet her eye. I've heard that's a sign of aggression.Methy Woman grabbed a 32 oz. foam cup out of the wall hole. Lightweight. She gave Younger Guy a look of annoyance. Pertaining to me. I could tell. Then she sneered in my direction. Rolled her eyes. I edged closer to the soda bar. The ice dispensers at BOTH ends work now. Careful not to tip over one-third of Three-Soda Annie's beverage haul, I rattled a tiny bit of ice into my refill cup. Three-Soda Annie gathered her be-topped bevy of potables and scooted off to the register. I moved over to the Diet Coke spout.Methy Woman sprang into action. She pressed that ice lever like a famished lab rat hitting his self-feeder in an obesity experiment. She shot Mountain Dew into her wide-mouthed cup while her own wide mouth practically salivated. As soon as it topped off, she bent her head over and SLURPED like a cowboy at a babbling brook. A drag rider, the cowboy at the back of the herd, after traveling twelve hours across the Dust Bowl.

Let's get back to MY liver.I started to get a bit worried. I treat my liver well. No alcohol to metabolize for MY liver. He's a teetotaller. Don't want him coming down with cirrhosis, by cracky! And no intravenous drug use or promiscuous sex to expose him to hepatitis. Yellow is not a good color on Val. She would not wear jaundice well. I don't make it a habit to go about my day kissing multitudes of people. So mononucleosis should steer clear of my liver. And I most certainly do not overdose on acetaminophen. I know that's a liver no-no. What could give me such spasms with a simple cough? Sure, I've been sick over the last ten days. But a round of azithromycin nipped that blight in the bud. So my liver should be in the pink of health, filtering blood cells willy-nilly, not even noticing that void in the middle where my gallbladder used to reside.Then the truth hit me like a cartoon frying pan over my cartoon head, with stars and birdies circling my noggin. I am getting old!There was no injury to my liver. My diaphragm was sore. Don't tell me people in this day and age don't know where their diaphragm is located. Surely you have all received adequate anatomy instruction in the public schools of our great nation. Or at least in your choir class in eighth grade. Your diaphragm separates your thoracic cavity from your abdominal cavity. It keeps your lungs from touching your liver. It also enables you to breathe. It's a big ol' muscle. As long as we're discussing structure, we might as well discuss function. Or not. Because all I really wanted to say was that my diaphragm was aching from overuse.Apparently, when old people practice CPR on a dummy for two hours, the diaphragm is sorely taxed. The liver, on the other hand, never breaks a sweat."}, {"title": "And a Little Pony Shall Lead Them", "date": "Wednesday, October 31, 2012", "text": "A colleague tracked me down this afternoon. Not with bloodhounds, and cops waving nightsticks, and heat-seeking helicopters, and fine-tooth-comb-gone-over photos from Google Earth. Nope. He went about it in the usual way, dropping by my classroom, where I wasn't, and interrogating the silent Pony, who sang like a canary that I was out on the parking lot performing afternoon duty.My colleague, we'll call him Mr. KIA, for reasons known to the students, strolled over to the concrete retaining wall upon which I had plopped. I do that when all the action dies down. Mainly to watch the lingerers, the kids who treat the parking lot (of the school which they proclaim to detest attending) like their own personal tailgate arena. I would not be surprised if the aroma of grilling brats wafted across that blacktop expanse.\"I have a problem,\" said Mr. KIA. \"And you're the solution.\" Which was not a statement that was music to my ears, having been the solution for previous problems, one of which involved carting Mr. KIA and his family across town from a broken-down car to a repair shop to pick up the just-fixed car.Mr. KIA is in charge of the school's entries for the VFW Voice of Democracy Speech Contest. He was on an official mission. Both of my boys entered. Genius is a two-time winner and previous placer. This is The Pony's first rodeo, he having just arrived at the high school campus this year.\"I have good news. And bad news,\" said Mr. KIA. \"Your son won. And your son did not win.\" The results are secret until the big reveal. But Mr. KIA has to notify the winner, because the winner must record his speech again for submission for further rounds of the contest. Monetary awards are given for the top five places. First place is worth $100.The Pony won the contest.Mr. KIA was a bit beside himself. \"I'm not sure what to do. I have no influence on the judges. It's a blind contest. No names. The judges listen to the entire audio tape of speeches. They don't know who is who. I can't tell anybody the places. Only the winner. But I'm telling you, because I know The Pony has been sick, and he MUST be at school tomorrow to record his speech for submission. Even if he's sick, can you bring him in before school to give his speech?\"\"I'll make sure he's here, no matter what.\"\"That's a relief. Otherwise, he forfeits the win. I'll leave it up to you to tell Genius that he didn't win this year.\"\"Oh, I think he can find out when it's announced. Like everybody else.\"In retrospect, I think I see what Mr. KIA was getting at. Perhaps I should tip him off. It's not every day that a 12th-grade MIT prospect with an ACT score of 35 is beaten in a speech contest by his 9th-grade brother.The Pony is moderately excited. Not for the money. Money is of little value to him. He is over the moon on cloud nine because he has earned the honor of the title. WINNER.

I've had it before, even more thorough than this presentation, in another district. Once you've been trained in unchoking people, or restarting their ticker, you never really forget how. It's like riding a bicycle, but without the wind in your hair.Times have changed. Now we watch a video of actors performing CPR, rather than listen to a presenter from the American Red Cross. The resuscitables are mere slick plastic torsos that light up at the shoulder when you're pumping them right. Gone is Resusci-Annie in her navy blue track suit, whose floppy legs the coaches so loved to tie in knots. Gone, too, the dummy infant.Which reminds me of my precious Baby Genius. He was only six or eight months old at the time. We were visiting my mother, who sat Baby Genius on her knee and fed him candy orange slices. I KNOW! I told her not to do that. She replied, \"He's not EATING them, honey. He doesn't even have teeth. I'm just letting him suck the sugar off the outside. He loves it!\" And we see how Baby Genius got started down the road of spoilitude.I should have commanded Mom to stop with the orange slices already. But you know how it is. You never know when you might need Mom to babysit, so you don't want to ruffle any mother hen feathers. She went on plying Baby Genius with sticky jelly candies, and I reclined on the couch reading the local paper. Until I heard a \"GAAAAASP!\" A sudden intake of air. Squealing, almost. It's what my mom does when she panics. She's done it her whole life, ever since I can remember. She sucks all the air out of the universe, then freezes. Whatever calamity was about to befall her will just have to happen. Because Mom has given up. A kangaroo could punch her, a grizzly bear could maul her, a giant anaconda could crawl out of the swamp and swallow her. All while she remained immobile, eyes bugged out, mouth dropped open.I jumped off that couch in a jiffy. Baby Genius had his eyes bugged out, too. His baby blues registered surprise. He made no noise. Mom stared at him. And at the half of a candy orange slice between her thumb and finger. I grabbed Baby Genius and flipped him over on my left forearm. Not an easy feat. He was a healthy baby. I lowered his head. Held his chin on my palm with my thumb and index finger, so his head didn't flop around. Kind of wedged his right leg up under my armpit so I didn't drop him. I thumped him on the back with the heel of my right hand. Once. Twice.A gob of gummy goo shot out of his mouth. Baby Genius started to scream. Mom regained her voice. \"I won't give him orange slices any more.\"If you've never been trained in CPR or the Heimlich Maneuver, you might want to check into a first aid class.

I strive to be Val Physicsseed, spreading knowledge across the nation.This morning The Pony and I were nearly flattened by an oncoming dump truck. It was pulling a trailer holding a backhoe, as trucks on our blacktop county road are wont to do. I crested a hill and saw my imminent doom barreling toward my Tahoe's grill. Some inhuman sound that originated deep in my throat may or may not have escaped my lips. I veered for the ditch which would be a shoulder on a normal road, and jammed on my brakes. Anti-lock. I know that, because a light on my dashboard told me for the next mile.A collision was narrowly avoided when Dumpy swerved himself back into his designated lane. Items in my nonpressurized cabin flew around like so much space shuttle detritus. Only faster. My large plastic free hospital cup of ice and water wedged itself under the heating control box, thankfully saving me from a day without sweet, sweet well water. A stubby recycled garlic butter cup full of change slid from one end of my inch-deep console top to the other, along a non-skid rubber strip. A screw appeared out of nowhere. I hope nothing falls off in the next few trips.But the main casualty of this Law of Inertia lesson was a pill. A tidbit of medication that I take just before arrival at work. I could take it with the others during breakfast, but it is a heart-rate slower. It makes me feel like I'm walking underwater in a deep-sea-diver suit as I enter the building. So I take it right before we get there, and I don't notice the immediate effects for the first thirty minutes like I would otherwise. I always put it on the top of the inch-deep console compartment where I don't have to fish for it.In case you are not on speaking terms with Newton's First Law of Motion, aka the Law of Inertia, allow me to introduce you. An object at rest tends to stay at rest, or continue in motion at the same speed and direction, unless acted upon by an outside force. There. Shake hands with him. He's a reliable kind of guy.That pill sailed along at forty miles per hour while the rest of the Tahoe stopped. Sailed along. To parts unknown. It was not even missed until after I pulled over at an opportune farm road entrance and turned off the Tahoe, then turned it back on. That cleared my brake light on the dash. So I assumed it made my brakes work normally again. I'm a science teacher, not a mechanic.Half a mile down the road, I looked for my pill. I don't know why. It's not like my heart was racing from the shot of adrenaline that dump truck injected into it. MY PILL WAS GONE! We were already late, due to the near-death experience, and Genius being left home sick with a fever. I couldn't go back for another pill. I hit the lettered county road, then the short cut past the bowling alley. I pulled over at the alley.The Pony was put to lookin' for that pill. \"It's white,\" I explained. \"Like an aspirin.\" I sorted through the stack of white tissues by the drink holders. No pill. I looked in the drink-holder wells. No pill. The Pony scoured the passenger seat and floor. It should have been simple to spot that pill on the black leather and carpet. No pill. I had just about decided to go on to school, ask for a sub, and go home to spend the day with sick Genius, where another pill awaited. One last try. \"Pony. I'm going to climb out, and you look really good under my seat, and in between it and the console.\" I stepped down. The Pony walked up to peer into the driver's side. He leaned over. Reached up under the dash, behind the brake pedal, and picked that pill off the black carpet past the custom floor mat.Mr. Newton, a simple pill can travel quite far at forty miles per hour before gravity drags him down, and he slams into the front of the driver's compartment.I'll bet you thought that inch-high console lip would stop it. You must have forgotten that the Tahoe had just come over the hill, and was headed down the other side when I anti-locked my brakes. That pill sailed along in a straight line until gravity pulled it down and it hit the floor in front of the brake pedal. It ended up on the left side of the Tahoe, because I had veered to the right, toward the ditch. The Pony and I had been dead wrong in looking for it straight ahead, and on the passenger side.Mr. Newton is never wrong where motion is concerned."}, {"title": "A Jarring Experience", "date": "Sunday, October 28, 2012", "text": "There have been some improvements to our infrastructure out here in Backroads.A blacktop byway notorious for its rough surface received a major makeover last week. That section of road was a nightmare. The city had put in sewers or a drainage system under the road. The resulting patch job made the eighth-mile strip a cobbled conglomerate of differently-elevated platforms. A toddler could have seen the need to apply a single coating of asphalt, run over it with a roller, ensure the edges were lower than the middle for drainage purposes, and slap some sealer on top. Voila! Yes. The proverbial toddler was fluent in French.It seemed that the city fathers had accepted the lowest bid on the original job. With no reservations. Driving over that segment of thoroughfare was like steering the lunar module over uneven green-cheese terrain. Lowe's could have set up a mobile service department to shake their paint by hauling gallons of Sherwin Williams across that rough patch. The large metal manhole lid was elevated, sitting atop a mini-Everest of faded blacktop. It made a clanging noise each time the tire-Sherpas carried an automobile up and over the peak. Not one smooth segment, but approximately forty-eight contiguous multi-level segments of various fade-itude comprised that compromised roadway. Had it been an article of clothing, it would have been Dolly Parton's coat of many colors. Except that rather than cut-up scraps of cloth from donated clothing, it would have been scraps of unwanted asphalt poured by traveling con-men assuring you that they were doing you a favor by giving you a deal on the material left over from a job down the street, and rather than being many colors, it would have been monochromatic, and instead of keeping a schoolgirl warm, it would have broken the back of an Olympic-level weightlifter. But other than that...it was just like Dolly's coat of many colors.Now, that street is as smooth as a baby's bottom.

He carried on his travel bag of medication, and the cheap bag of personal clothes, because he knew it would be beat to $!*#.\u00a0 He included in his checked rolling suitcase his steel-toed work boots, his recently obtained orthotics, his breather, his dirty underwear and socks, and his Crestor. I don't know why Crestor is in the doghouse. Why he couldn't ride with the cool meds in the pressurized cabin. But I'm not here to defend a shunned statin. The checked bag was lost between Boston and Chicago.Hick said the Southwest people promised to deliver his lost bag to our house today. I laughed. I've watched those airport shows. On the Fly, specifically about Southwest Airlines, on TLC. And Airport 24/7 on The Travel Channel. And Baggage Battles. I told Hick, \"Yeah. Sure. They're going to deliver it to your house? I don't think so. Right now it's probably in an aircraft hanger with 50,000 other bags, waiting for people to bid on it at auction. Boy, is somebody going to be mad when they pay a couple thousand dollars for your breather and dirty underwear!\"Hick insisted that he was told the bag would be delivered by Fed Ex. Until this morning. when Southwest called to tell him that his bag had arrived in St. Louis, and they would have it here by Tuesday. Having already gone the night without breathing, needing his Crestor, and requiring his steel-toed boots for work Monday, Hick waxed cantankerous. Sorry. Southwest can only deliver lost baggage within a radius of thirty miles. Otherwise, they have to contract the job, which takes longer. You know. Because people who travel all live within thirty miles of an airport.So Hick planned to drive to the airport for his bag of vitals. He was promised a one-hundred-dollar travel voucher for his trouble. But he didn't really want to spend the day driving to and from the airport. So he called back and asked if the driver could meet him halfway, at his workplace. Sure thing. Within a four-hour window of time. However, the driver called before leaving, so the transfer was made without a hitch. But there was no voucher.On the bright side, Hick will be breathing all night, with even-keel cholesterol, a pile of dirty socks and underwear back under his own roof, dreaming of how safe his toes will be at work next week."}, {"title": "That's Not a Regular Item on my Shopping List", "date": "Friday, October 26, 2012", "text": "I had a day off from school today.

I have been sick since Monday night. I called the doctor yesterday to see if I could have some medicine called in to my pharmacy. A little something for a burning chest and green phlegm. I could not get there in time last night. So today, I called the pharmacy to make sure my presents were wrapped and ready for pick-up. Indeed. Two medicinal gifts were awaiting Val at her earliest convenience. The thought got me through the day. An antibiotic, I presumed, for the green phlegm. And some cough medicine to liquify it and expel it without unproductively-coughing my fool head off every sixty seconds.Remember how, when you were a kid, you ripped open a package and saw that your grandma had given you a twelve-pack of tube socks?I felt like that today.

It could no more contain a bottle of cough medicine than a wrapped-up Norman Rockwell calendar could contain an Easy Bake Oven.

I'm a working woman (not THAT kind) who must drive herself to work. Who has been having bouts of dizziness since the weekend, along with some ear pain upon swallowing.

I am livid. Spitting mad. Ready to spew vitriol with more zeal than a disgruntled camel.It all started with the meeting. A meeting of parents interested in learning more about scholarship opportunities for their young 'uns. Deadlines, the filling out of forms, tricks and tips, etc. Before the meeting was called to order, I arrived at the venue. I cooled my heels browsing through the library stacks. A free moment is a terrible thing to waste. As an insider, I had access to the room before it was free of a lingering meeting which convened before the scholar escapades. I could hear the incoming mob outside the door. Like Vandals, unused to biding their time, eager for the pillaging to commence.I stepped out from the stacks when the presenter announced that the crowd could enter. She encouraged attendees to sign in, and pick up one each of the seventeen stacks of material on the table. As I took my first step, the horde surged past me. I narrowly avoided spinning like a cartoon Tasmanian Devil. Unwilling to lose an arm in the maelstrom of thrashing talons, I headed for a table at the edge of the library, with the intent to come back to the materials when the hubbub died down.I found a chair at the end of an empty table. Upon the table in front of that chair, I placed my stack of note paper, topped by the grade report of The Pony. I laid my red rolling writer upon the grade report. And lastly, I set my new bifocals on top of the grade report. Like a beltless raincoat draped over a theater chair, my accoutrements signaled TAKEN. They could not have been mistaken as a mere pile of discarded scratch paper. After all, my personal touches were evident. A grade report with my son's name on it. Bifocals, for cryin' out loud.Many of you who moonlight in forensics for the FBI might have surmised by now that something untoward is about to occur. That my personal territory-markers, tooting a tin horn with exuberant Christmas glee like Gizmo, the original Gremlin, are about to be drenched with Stripe spit. Figuratively, of course.I returned from my information-gathering sortie, only to find that an unsavory segment of the mob had rushed my saved table like uncouth hillbillies stampeding from their neck of the woods to a town that lost its power, in an effort to grab their unfair share of the vittles being served up by the Red Cross. A self-important woman, a high priestess, perhaps, of the Vandals, had already directly linked her nether regions with the cushion of my saved chair. She was PASSING MY STACK OF PAPERS, PEN, AND BIFOCALS over the heads of other usurpers seated near her. \"Here. Here. Somebody take this.\" Not merely pushing it aside. Pretending it wasn't marking my saved place. She was actively, aggressively, PASSING MY STACK OF PAPERS, PEN, AND BIFOCALS over various and sundry heads, attempting to dispose of the evidence.I strode to her side. \"Those are my papers. Give them to me. It looks like I'm sitting somewhere else.\"She did not even have the common decency to cower before me. To make an excuse. In fact, I thought I was going to have to lean my ample bosom onto her head to hold still her swaying, like that of a King Cobra menacing before a strike. I recovered the tools of my trade while the howling jackals looked on, unabashed.I retreated to the opposite end of the room, and sat in a seat that mirrored hers, the one that used to be mine.

Temperatures in the fifties Saturday afternoon, and in the upper seventies Sunday.Thank goodness our air conditioner broke this summer when temps hovered at one-hundred-seven for several days. Because now we have a working AC/heating unit. Funny how at first the repair guy put in coolant. Then a week later, upon the second breakdown, said we needed the whole heat pump thingy replaced. Oh, and on his way out, decided that maybe the thermostat was the problem. So he hooked us up with a new one. Free of charge. And even took the old one to dispose of.Everything has been working throughout the late summer and fall. Cool nights? Hick switched it over to heat upon rising in the crisp morning chill. And when Genius got home from school first, he put it back on cool to maintain comfort. I, myself, have not inspected the new thermostat. The old one gave me a headache. It was top of the line. State of the art. A gadget man's gadget. Only the best for Hick. He is like my dad used to be about owning only Craftsman tools. If he was a car man, he would walk around spouting, \"Porsche.

Heck, it would have held the pickle, held the lettuce, and sang, \"...special orders don't upset us,\" like a squeaky clean teen in 1973 Burger King commercial. He was simply amazing. He could bring home the bacon and fry it up in the pan, all the while never letting Hick forget he was a man. Not to say that Thermo was feminine, or a wearer of Enjoli or anything. He and I peacefully co-existed. Hick would sometimes program him to run cold during winter days, and warm up just before we got home. Saw that he kicked it down a notch overnight, while were were tucked snug as bugs in rugs with visions of comfortable temperatures dancing in our heads.The new thermostat is a piece of crap.Today I felt a bit warm upon ascending from my cool basement lair to prepare the evening meal. I knew Thermy had been set on heat for the recent spate of cool days and nights. I stopped by to take a look. No door to open like Thermo used to have. Thermy simply had a button on the front to slide amongst four settings. Emergency, heat, off, cool. That's it. I called for Genius. Asked him to put it on the setting that would run the heat at night, and the AC during the day. He laughed. \"That piece of crap doesn't have one.\"Hick is going on a business trip tomorrow. I must be able to fend for myself in the event that Genius is out gallivanting around. When Hick tromped in for supper, I asked him about the new thermostat. How to make it heat and cool without manually switching settings. \"Oh, you just put it on AUTO.\" I heard Genius chuckle. He hollered that no such setting existed on Thermy. Hick begged to differ. He turned on the light. He fetched his glasses. He poked and prodded. \"Huh.\"So we have the cheapest thermostat in the history of the world.

When we were picking up the clutter for the impending visit of his gasoline-bomb crony, we found a mysterious object on the kitchen counter, in the area where Hick tosses items he has no use for, but can't bear to discard.\"What's this thing? It looks like some kind of battery pack.\"\"Mom. That's the light pack for the cap you gave Dad for Christmas. The one where the lights clipped onto the bill. He broke the clip.\"\"So it's no good anymore? It can't be strapped on a cap as a headlight to feed the goats after dark?\"\"Not really. It's junk.\"\"Toss it.\"\"WAIT! Give it to me. I'll take the LED lights out of it. I can use them.\"He's a cannibalizer, that boy. Bits of wire here. Switches there. Relays, whatever they are. Circuit board thingies. It's beyond me. He has a knack for creating things he needs. At least he's dealing in electronic items, not digging up body parts and zapping life into a Frankenstein.He's selective in his creations, though. He's been developing his own film in the kitchen sink for a couple of weeks. He showed me a somewhat sepia, somewhat black-and-white print of Mount Rushmore that he took on vacation two years ago. As he was extending his arm, the photo was backlit by a floor lamp. \"Wow! Look at that! It's so cool!\" I turned to admire his handiwork. He was right.\"You need to get one of those frames that light up the picture. I saw them on The Celebrity Apprentice a couple of years ago.\"\"Those things are expensive.\"\"Make your own.\"\"I could totally do that. But where would I put it? I don't have room on my desk. I'm not going to drill into the wall to hang it. I'm leaving home in six months. That would be a waste.\"So much for that idea. It's like he had it all worked out. Designed it, built it, framed the pic, and decided that there was no place for it. Easy as pie.Not all of his inventions are gems. There was the idea of the car that converts into a plane. You know. For quick trips to Walmart. Never mind that there would have to be landing areas and parking places for planes. And flight plans. And operator's licenses. Those details were of no concern to him. Not his fault if folks didn't look where they were going, and flaming car-planes plummeted from the sky onto the unsuspecting citizenry. (There really is such a car-plane, you know. I've seen one somewhere like a Hammacher Schlemmer catalog.)Likewise, his plan to deliver mail to individual homes through vacuum tubes like those used at the bank drive-thru was not well-thought-out. First, the expense of digging underground tube tunnels. Then the question of how the canisters would know where to go. And collisions at tube intersections. And where to store all the canisters, And what about the lack of pressure if everybody decided they wanted their mail at the same time. And how to clear a clogged tube. And would there be giant tubes from postal hubs to local post offices. The only positive I could see was the opportunity to avoid entering the dead-mouse-smelling post office.I'm sure Genius is not the only inventor to conjure up duds. Surely even George Washington Carver came up with a couple of yucky peanut recipes. Thomas Edison produced 99 % perspiration. Leonardo da Vinci cobbled those unbalanced water-walking shoes.

Something is percolating. Bubbling to the surface. I can't stop it. It's about to erupt like a grossly-overloaded zit being squeezed and recorded for posterity on YouTube.I have the urge to commend somebody for a job well done.Yeah. It feels as foreign for me to type those words as it does for you to read them. Here's the situation. Thursday morning, I called in some prescription refills. It just so happens that my pharmacy is one that has been bought out by a larger chain. Nothing but problems have ensued since the changeover started. People wait in lengthy lines, only to be told that their insurance company is not responding to calls. That the pharmacy is out of stock in that particular medicine. That Express Scripts denies their coverage.Last month, I was given the runaround on a particular prescription. The reason, it seems, that it cost me thirty-four dollars more than in previous months was that one of my two insurances was not responding. Just bring my receipt next time to get a refund when the insurance responds. You guessed it. I did that. Nope. It was more because the doctor needed to write a letter to the insurance telling them that I can't take the generic. Yep. It was totally an issue between me an my doctor. I turned down their offer of a great deal on swampland in Florida.Thursday morning, I called in the refills to the automated system. I knew better than to try and pick them up Thursday afternoon. So I waited until Friday afternoon. What do you know! One was not filled. But the counter girl without a name tag looked it up, and said she would have it filled if I wanted to wait. Which kind of defeats the purpose of calling it in the day before so it would be ready. But I waited. A different girl, more of a gal, really, called me when it was ready. She rang it up. I stopped before scanning my debit card. \"Are you sure that's right? Because I paid a lot more last month.\" Beth, the gal, checked. It was the overcharged prescription, back to its regular price. I explained my previous runaround, in which she had no part. She said she would check on it for me. That it would be worth the wait if she could get me a refund. So I waited.Finally, a matron called my name. Hers was Donna. She knows me on sight. She rang up my order at the lower price, and shoved thirty-four dollars and seven cents across the counter. \"Let's take care of this refund first.\" No asking for the old receipt, or my ID, or my insurance cards. Just cash on the countertop, baby!I have a good mind to call the local paper and nominate Unknown, Beth, and Donna for the adult version of Caught Being Good. Or write a letter to their store manager complimenting them on their customer service skills. I'm so giddy, I might just do both.I think I have a fever."}, {"title": "Messin' With Hick's Flock", "date": "Thursday, October 18, 2012", "text": "It's no secret that my little Pony is an egg collector. Not a connoisseur of fine Faberge eggs. Not a hoarder of hen fruit. He's the guy who goes out each evening to look under chickens' butts for eggs. This has been his job since Hick bought his first two hens and a rooster. We won't discuss the unfortunate massacre that ensued at this juncture.Even though he is now fourteen, The Pony grabs his little red-and-green wicker Easter basket and skips over to the chicken pen, twirling it on his wrist. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But I'm glad we live in the country. No good can come of his classmates getting a glimpse of this side of The Pony. His job has grown more challenging, now that the fowl roam at will about the grounds, dropping eggs as the mood strikes. That's only possible because our dogs have been aversion-trained to not eat the chickens. We won't discuss Hick's questionable canine-training methods at this juncture.In spring and early summer, The Pony sometimes found fourteen eggs a day. Those were the salad days, my friends. The egg salad days. A stealthy spoiled neighbor dog put an end to that bounty. He siphoned off several of our layers. Witnesses reported that he carried the lifeless bodies home. His owners put up a skeptical front when interrogated. We won't discuss the across-the-road feud at this juncture.In recent weeks, The Pony has been gathering two eggs per day. Sherlock Hick has deduced that my favorite rescue doggie is eating his eggs. Never mind that I have seen our older rescue dog carry two in her mouth, eat one, then eat the other as MY favorite rescue doggie licks the remains out of the cracked shell. Sherlock Hick presents, as Exhibit A, the fact that he gathered eggs himself on Saturday, laid them on top of the large garbage can that holds chicken feed, and found them missing when he returned an hour later. We won't discuss the issuer of Sherlock Hick's law license at this juncture.On Monday, The Pony charged into the kitchen waving his basket. \"I found one egg, and A GOLF BALL!\" Which he had carried into the house in the egg basket. Like Hick was going to crack it and eat it. Or put it in a carton with the eggs he sells to a gal at work. The Pony was flabbergasted with his find. \"I don't know HOW a GOLF BALL got into the chicken nest!\" We won't discuss The Pony's sorry knowledge of chicken anatomy at this juncture.I suggested that, perhaps, Hick had put it there to make the chickens more inclined to lay in the nest. The Pony allowed that he had heard of putting a plastic Easter egg in the nest to elicit laying. But not a golf ball. He did, however, grudgingly return the Titleist to the nest, with a promise to ask Hick if he had planted it. We won't discuss the naughty faux pas of spelling \"Titleist\" without the \"e\" at this juncture.Yesterday, I asked The Pony if he had talked to Hick about the golf ball. \"No. But don't worry. I put it back out there in the chicken coop. I put it in a different nest, though.\" I have no idea what possessed The Pony to mess with the chickens. He'd be safer messin' with Sasquatch over some Jack Links Beef Jerky. These little peckers don't take kindly to a hand ruffling their underfeathers in search of an egg. The roosters don't take kindly to anybody male invading their territory. We won't discuss what happens to roosters who challenge Hick at this juncture.Imagine, if you will, our poor Ameraucana layers, no slouch in the colored egg department, discovering a golf ball in the nest where they deposit their pastel greeny bluey eggs. \"Oh, dear. What's this white dimpled thing? I should not be pleased to observe the misbegotten embryo that would hatch from such an ugly case.\" So to think they have gotten rid of the golf ball, then to find it popping up one nest over, is not going to set well with the setter. We won't discuss what might happen if Hick's chickens start laying a rainbow of miniature-golf-suitable, dimpled, spherical eggs at this juncture.Somewhere, Hick is happily puttering around his BARn, singing under his breath. \"Oh...I had a little chicken and she wouldn't lay an egg, so I put an old golf ball between her legs...\""}, {"title": "You Might as Well Try and Ditch the Wind", "date": "Wednesday, October 17, 2012", "text": "I was the short-straw winner of parking lot duty this morning.

A twisty wispy current that reshaped my hair until I looked like a cat had given my head a bath. A cat without a cosmetology license.Thankfully, it is not yet Chapstick season. Because tufts of hair would have become glued to my lips. At least this morning they waved to and fro, tickling me like a freshman on a band bus headed for a competition, wielding a pillow feather and stroking the undernose area of sleeping trombone players. It was the kind of wind that hawks ride like an aerial lazy river. Two yellow sugar-maple leaves circled overhead like a pair of such raptors, but without the promise of snagging a field mouse, or dropping liquid feces on my head.

Perhaps you remember my original visit to the optometrist's office, when all the workers ran around bumping into each other like ants, shouting about my blood pressure, which, according to the optometrist himself, did not even warrant mention.Now I have figured out their obsession with blood pressure! And I'll share it with you. That office sends people's blood pressure skyrocketing like a mallet-and-bell test-of-strength at a carnival.I arrived at 3:25, frames in hand. The counter girl took them and told me to have a seat. There were 25 chairs in the waiting room. I'll tell you how I know that a little bit later. None were occupied. So I chose one at the end of a row, my back to the front wall, right next the glass vestibule. I had a view of the whole waiting room, the counter, the main hallway, and the entrance.One man came in after me. He told the counter girl that he'd been there three days in a row. Sucks to be him. I just didn't know how hard. A couple of frail, elderly women tottered in. A younger one followed. After a brief respite at the counter, they were told to have a seat. I'll be ding-dang-donged if they didn't sit RIGHT NEXT TO ME! Do you get my drift? There were 24 chairs from which to choose, and they chose the one RIGHT NEXT TO ME! I didn't know there were 24 chairs left. I had to surreptitiously count them with shifty eyes like those in a portrait in a medieval castle, because I didn't want to turn my head and inadvertently start a conversation with that spinster RIGHT NEXT TO ME.I think, perhaps, they were severely dehydrated. Not thinking clearly. After all, people on an airplane would shy away from me. Complain to the stewardess. Boldly announce that I needed to purchase two tickets. Ask that I be removed from the flight because surely the plane was over the weight limit which would allow it to soar into the wild blue yonder. But here, in a Backroads optometrist's office, Slim Fady and her cohort wanted to rub elbows with me. Moisten their twiggy arms with the sheen of grease seeping out of my folds. I felt like Jabba the Hutt next to an anorexic tween version of Olive Oyl.I would have been beside myself, but Slim Fady had already taken that chair. If she was Lucy and I was Ethel, we could have fought over the armrest like ex-friends in a theater. I didn't know how to cope. I wanted to write down snide remarks about her in my little spiral notebook, stuffed down the side of my purse, which I was clutching with a death grip, making it my own personal stress ball. However...I couldn't write because Slim Fady was RIGHT NEXT TO ME! She could have read everything I wrote. Kind of. Because I didn't bring in my bifocals, being there to pick up new ones along with my new lenses. And obviously, Slim herself was at the freakin' eye doctor for a reason. I believe she had mumbled something about not knowing what she was seeing because everything was blurry when she looked above her bifocals. Lucky for me, though, that I'm ambidextrous. I wiggled out my tiny spiral, my extra-thin Zebra pen, and went to town releasing my vitriol onto paper. I kept it turned away from her. Pretended it was just my wacky lefty writing style.People began to pour into that office like refugees from an overheated clown car. A woman strode in dragging a hot-tempered little redhead by her wrist. The sister, maybe a year older, and a lifetime of second-fiddleness in her future, stumbled in three feet behind, managing to slam herself in each of the two entrance doors. In her defense...she WAS wearing glasses and entering an optometrist's office. A tall nerdy high school boy came in. An older blond woman with hair shorter than Ellen Degeneres. A mommy with a boy toddler. A gal with a girl toddler. All told...in 25 minutes, 22 people entered that office.I was growing more perturbed by the minute. The one poor three-day guy was still at the counter, being quizzed on whether he took any medication. \"Just for blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think.\" Great Googly Moogly, dude! Toss me one of those. They're generic. One point six six six repeating cents apiece!Hope sprang eternal in my ruffled breast when I heard the companion to Slim Fady and Accomplice on the phone saying it was kind of crowded, and maybe the task could be accomplished another day. Imagine my surprise when she got up and left. Left Slim and her sidekick right there. They were not together. Meanwhile, all hands on deck were helping a family of three pick out new frames. I understand that frames are the bread and butter of the office. But that family was there before I arrived, treating the office like a cooling center.Counter Girl came over and relieved me of Slim Fady and Co. Wouldn't you know it, not thirty seconds later, the questionable-parenting-skilled gal parked her girl toddler ONE CHAIR AWAY FROM ME. And left her! Absconded to the counter, leaving a tot who could barely string a sentence together. \"Book? Book? Me walk. Book?\" Mom Gal came back. Set Girl Tot in the chair again. Gave her a book. Left. \"Sticker? Book? Me walk.\" Please make it stop, for the love of all that is booky and totty!Fortune then smiled upon me. My years of clean living having paid off, Even Steven settling a score, Counter Girl (no, she wasn't that efficient, there were four of them, interchangeable) came out with my new frames, new bifocals, and a paper for me to sign twice.I really need to call the doctor and get my blood pressure checked.***************************************************** ALTERNATE TITLES that converged upon the page, not taken:Blind Like MeThere Are None so Blind as Those Who Go to the Optometrist's Office at 3:30 on a Monday Afternoon"}, {"title": "The Deck of the Edmund Fitzgerald", "date": "Sunday, October 14, 2012", "text": "Out here in Backroads, our trees are BEAUTIFUL!I feel like I am living in a New England calendar. Genius was dispatched this afternoon to record the views with hues for posterity. I suggested the glowing yellows down by the creek in the mailbox vicinity, or the street in town by the library and the dead-mouse-smelling post office. Genius, however, held out in favor of Hick's creekside cabin foliage. Most of which is now on the deciduous forest floor, thanks to last night's storm. That little structure in the background is not the cabin. It's a deer feeder.The mailbox area caught my fancy when I stepped out to get the mail this afternoon on my way to town for a 44 oz. Diet Coke. No, we don't have mail delivery on Sunday. We have mail delivery on Saturday, and three guys who would forget their head if it wasn't held on by that flap of skin called a neck. The sky was overcast, making those yellow trees pop all the more. The air had that fallish smell of crushed leaves. But the wind whipped like the lion of March.It was not an ill wind blowing no good. More like a wind of fortune. A windfall. The green metal pipe mailbox custom-made by Hick contained a letter for Genius from Missouri S&T. The school of science and technology. Formerly the University of Missouri-Rolla. Way formerly the School of Mines. The letter offered Genius a scholarship package of $8,500 per year. Nothing to sneeze at. He has until May 1 to accept. Right now he still has his heart set on MIT, then Stanford, then Washington University. He looks at Missouri S&T as his safety school. I look at it as a perfectly suitable choice for his engineering major.That wind was out of control. Last night, it blew right into the very wall of Genius's bedroom window. He had a leak from the top of the window to the sill. Hick thinks the rain blew horizontally and ended up coming in through the soffit on the front porch roof. He checked the attic, and could find no evidence of a roof leak.As I exited my Tahoe to re-fill-up my 44 oz. cup of liquid energy, the wind whipped around me like an invisible cartoon Tasmanian Devil. I daresay my shirt would have gone up over my head if I hadn't plastered it to my sides with both arms. The gales of November have come early. Such blustering should not be felt in Missouri.

The organized chaos of the spic-and-spanning was a bit like giving a mouse a cookie. An ADD mouse. I moved items on the counter, then I had to wipe the counter, then the stove looked grimy in comparison, but a shiny stove is no good if that back thing with the controls is spotted, and the knick-knacks lodged atop the stove-back needed a good scrubbing so they didn't stick out like greasy thumbs.One such item was a stand-up, three-inch-tall, Pepto-Bismol-colored ceramic pig, with a hole in his head to shove three bright pink measuring spoons. A long-ago student gifted me with that cute little pig, so precious with his painted-on chef's apron and cheerful snout. If there's one thing the world does not need, it's a pig with greasy skin. I chucked Piggy into the leftover dishwater which I was using for wiping down the countertops. Between swipes at my burgundy-speckled counter, I turned to wipe off Piggy. Not with the dishwashing sponge. That would just be wrong. I grabbed a soft- and rough-sided sponge that Genius had previously used for the shower door. I used the soft side, of course. To no avail.Swatches of Piggy's pink skin flaked off upon contact. Not his entire epidermis. Just spots here and there. Pink gone. White underneath. Like a case of vitiligo. \"Oops!\" I said. \"Piggy is peeling like he has a bad sunburn.\"Genius screamed at me. \"Stop scrubbing him with the rough side! No wonder. You're scraping off his skin!\"\"I am not. I used the soft side. I don't want to throw him away. He holds measuring spoons!\" Because, you see, as a new gourmet cook, I never know when I might need an eighth-, fourth-, or third-teaspoon of rosemary for some exotic, five-ingredient, crockpot creation. I stood Piggy on his head in the dish drainer.Genius puttered around, sweeping the kitchen floor in a manner acceptable only to seventeen-year-old guest-hosters. He had grabbed the broken-down, angled broom from the laundry room, after first announcing that he really didn't care if the floor was swept or not. Because, of course, our kitchen floor could be piled ankle deep with peanut shells like a dining room at Texas Roadhouse, but that darn three-inch pig should be spotless. He swept up a pile of departed dust bunnies large enough to make a toupee for Hick. Not over by the wastebasket, but out in the middle of the kitchen. \"There's no dustpan. Can I just leave this here?\"After \"discovering\" two dustpans between the washer and the wall, Genius snatched the kitchen floor bald. He had a glass of water he wanted to pour out. \"Hey! The sink is full of water! What am I supposed to do with this?\"\"I'm done. Pull the plug and let it out.\"\"Noooo! I might get Piggy's flesh on my fingers!\"Piggy is back in his old kingdom-surveying spot now. A little worse for wear. I can't see throwing away a perfectly cute pig just because he lost some color.

I recently considered a life of crime.Actually, it was more like an afternoon of crime. I'm not really one to rock the boat. I'm the one clinging to the sides, screaming at the others, \"Stop rocking the freakin' boat already!\" I fear consequences more than I enjoy living on the edge.The whole crime spree thing is Genius's fault. That boy is having a guest spend the night this weekend. A fellow seventeen-year-old boy from a neighboring school district. See. That part is significant. I don't normally encourage sleepovers for my boys. A big part of that comes from being a teacher for their friends. It is weird to have your students in your house.Genius used to have an annual sleepover with four or five of his closest buddies. When they were younger, The Pony and I would spend the night at Grandma's house while Hick supervised the extra young 'uns. As they grew older, Genius was allowed to have his party in the BARn loft. The kids loved it. They stayed up all night watching movies and playing video games and eating junk food and looking at Hick's posters of bikinied beer models on the wall. Now they are all tied up with sports or girlfriends or jobs, and can't coordinate a weekend for the gathering. Genius has been running around with like-minded nerd friends from nearby schools. Like the one whose dad shot bottles of gasoline for entertainment.Stay with me. I'll eventually get to the crime spree.For two weeks, we have been sprucing up our abode in anticipation of the sojourn of The Invited Guest. Genius has worked himself to the bone, cleaning his room, his shower and toilet and sink, plus the basement computer graveyard. We're not quite ready for a layout in Better Homes and Gardens, but The Invited Guest is less likely to be trapped under a stack of hoard and press the rescue squad to call for an intervention. A more thorough effort could not have been made to ready Great Britain for the Queen's Golden Jubilee. Genius has even decided that I should put my new fundraiser crockpot cookbook to use, and make Orange-Glazed Chicken for Saturday supper. Thank goodness I bought a 5-Ingredient Meals cookbook.So here comes the grand larceny scheme. I told Genius that it would have been cheaper to buy them each a pizza than it was to obtain those five ingredients. Which is actually six, because apparently, the chicken doesn't count. I don't begrudge the growing boys their protein. But those ingredients added $21 to my Walmart tab. Granted, we'll all be enjoying the meal except for The Pony, who is a simple fellow with simple tastes. Genius allowed that he and The Invited Guest could have each had TWO pizzas from Little Caesar's for that amount. Indeed. But instead, they'll have boneless skinless chicken breasts, orange juice, chopped onion, crushed garlic, ground black pepper, and rosemary. Oh, and a side of rice, but that wasn't an ingredient, either. I already have a pepper grinder full of pepper beads or whatever they're called. And I'm making him settle for minced garlic, which I already have instead of fresh. It is the rosemary to which I object.Have you seen the price of rosemary at the Walmart lately?A small bottle of crushed rosemary is $4.97...DID YOU HEAR THAT? Four dollars and ninety-seven cents! For something that I'll only use a pinch of. Once. Unless we really like this recipe. I am by no means a gourmet crock pot cook. And I'm pretty sure that if I drove next door and asked to borrow a pinch of rosemary, the door would slam in my face. I'm not sure of the growing season for rosemary, but I'm also pretty sure that it's too late to start a window box garden.CRIME SPREE ALERT! I told Genius that I felt like opening that bottle of rosemary and shaking some into a small privacy envelope that I had slipped out of a box in the office supply department. Except that there are almost as many cameras in that Walmart as there are in our school building. And somebody might mistake my purloined rosemary for a different herb. Then I would be schmoozing with petty thieves and prostitutes and check-kiters and meth-makers and political candidate solicitor pot-shot-takers in the county lockup. Because The Pony would not think to call home, I would be learning new trades and making new friends until it was time for some sandwiches, and Hick and Genius thought to track me down and bail me out.

We were still putting away our bounty when Hick came through the kitchen door. He saw that work was in progress, and walked on through to the front door, proclaiming that HE would gather the eggs tonight. Hick came right back in, holding a paper.\"Look here. It says, 'Sorry I missed you. You can call if you have any questions.' Huh.\"It was a Xeroxed or Canoned or Kyoceraed copy of a political candidate's manifesto. From the looks of it, that copier was sorely in need of toner. But the most egregious insult in this blatant attempt to hunt down votes one by one was the fact that we live in a private association. That means we have signs at both entrances to our compound, declaring that THIS IS A PRIVATE ASSOCIATION. No Soliciting. No Trespassing. I may come from a line of simple country stock, but I think this means we don't want no 'lectioneers lollygaggin' up in these here parts.I won't reveal the candidate's name. Nor the party affiliation. Nor the district. But it was for the Missouri House of Representatives race. Furthermore, we do not live in this candidate's district. So the minions were barking up the wrong tree. Apparently, a candidate who would send out workers with badly-photocopied information on his campaign would not spring for a GPS so the volunteer workers would know if they were within district boundaries. It stands to reason that one would become disoriented while trespassing on the privately-maintained gravel thoroughfares of a private homeowners' association.This episode has unfurled two red flags and run them to the top of my flagpole. Given the shoddy wad of information stuffed into my doorjamb, with a handwritten note at the top, did the actual candidate himself stop by? And if so, would I want to vote for a person who blindly disregards the posted privacy rights of others? Flag number two, whipping in the chill wind, begs the question of whether this is a simple scam by ne'er-do-wells to case a joint and determine whether the owner is home.

She regularly touched bases with him at lunch time.The students were sometimes envious of the close relationship Mr. Haier shared with Val. On occasion, they tried to come between the two. Or attempted to insert themselves into Mr. Haier's good graces. Val was having none of that. Nobody comes between Val and her Mr. Haier.Each summer, high-level talks occurred concerning the feasibility of allowing Mr. Haier to stay on. \"Too expensive,\" some believed. \"Not justifiable,\" said others. But the matter was always tabled, no decision made to upset the status quo. It helped that other faculty members had their own Mr. Haier-like companions. Rocking the boat would have caused sure mutiny in the county.Yes, Monday was indeed a sad day. Val herself discovered the remains of Mr. Haier that morning. Already in the classroom. Sitting in the dark, in his regular place beside the file cabinet. The place where he liked to observe his kingdom, just chillin'.Val heard Mr. Haier's last gurgles. She went to him immediately, and detected a fever and flop sweat. She shook him. He did not respond. He was burning up. Due to the high fever, Val immediately disconnected Mr. Haier from life support. She cleared out all of his passageways. And immediately began a search for her new Mr. Haier.As luck would have it, a strapping young replacement was found online by the end of second hour. Val's husband, Hick, purchased the newbie on his way home from work. Val and The Pony carted him in Tuesday morn.RIP, Mr. Haier.

But I have no time for that today.Genius informed me that, contrary to his earlier rule, two seventeen-year-old guys CAN go out to eat together. As long as it's not to a fancy restaurant. Because then people would stare at them. But here's the update. A guy can tie a tie for another guy. With certain restrictions.How To Tie a Tie for Another Guy1. Do not face him and attempt to get it right. That is impossible. It's backwards.2. Do not stand behind him and reach around his neck and tie it like it's on your own neck. That is just weird.3. Have the guy take off his tie. Put it around your neck and tie it. Then loosen the knot and slip it off.4. Hand the already-tied tie to the tie guy. He can put it over his head and tighten the knot. Done.I also learned that it's better to take a chance on death by fiery automobile crash than to ride to school with your mom if the weather forecast is for ice and sleet. That would upset a guy's whole routine. He'd have to get up about an hour early, which is just not happening. Even if it's only for one or two days all winter. No. That's not an option. A little Ford Ranger truck with four-wheel-drive is as safe as a Tahoe, because a guy has driven that a whole year and a half already, and never had an accident on the ice. The mom can drive herself like she's done her whole life. Why would a little ice make her nervous now that she has a seventeen-year-old son who could possibly drive her, even though that's never gonna happen?I learn something every day."}, {"title": "As I Lay Freezing", "date": "Saturday, October 6, 2012", "text": "Wheeee doggies!

That's thanks to Hick, who left the official alarm set per normal workday, because Genius needed to arise at 6:00 to head to the city to take his SAT. Hick sees that as being perfectly sensible. The hitting of the snooze button for one hour and ten minutes. I, myself, do not.The bedroom was icy. Like one of those ice hotels, but without the vodka. I got up to throw a load of late-night-washed clothes into the dryer. The dryer which is on the other side of the bedroom headboard wall. An act which I see as perfectly sensible.

My fluffy comforter, purchased from an insurance salvage store with my employee discount many years ago, is much more effective at holding in body heat.

There's another conspiracy theory here in the heartland!The folks at my optometrist's office are now gathering information for the government. That's what they told me. I didn't even ask. They always want a list of medications. That's fair game. Something might be affecting my sight. Or I might be prescribed an antibiotic to which I am allergic. But this was totally different.Mr. O, the optometrist himself, was grousing about it. \"Excuse me. I've got to enter all this information. It's something new that we just started. We don't have a choice. It's for the government. We're still trying to learn the screens.\" He quizzed me on my medications that the air-cannon girl had already quizzed me on. The medications that I had handed on a list to the counter worker. The list that a totally different girl returned to me in the exam chair. That's four people waltzing around that office with my Hippa info. All that, and Dr. O could only find one medication listed on my account, and two that were not even medications that I have ever taken. The word cluster comes to mind.Oh, and the air-cannon girl was overly inquisitive as to my blood pressure. I was starting to think something was wrong with me.\"Do you have high blood pressure?\"\"I take medication for it. So, no. It's controlled.\"\"What was your blood pressure the last time you went to the doctor?\"\"I don't know. That was months ago. He didn't adjust my medicine.\"\"Was the bottom number in the seventies.\"\"I believe so.\"\"Was the top number in the one twenties?\"\"That sounds about right.\"\"Okay. We're going to go to a room and get your blood pressure taken.\"Criminy! You'd have thought they were rushing down the hall with a gurney to wheel me out to the helipad to life-flight me to a major trauma center. I feared that something weird had shown up in the air-cannon test, which I know is for glaucoma, or the click-on-the-wavy-lines test for peripheral vision, or the shine-the-light-into-the recesses-of-your-brain test while you look at a little red barn down a long dirt road.In the exam room, Air-Cannon Girl typed my medical info into the new database. Another girl came in and said she needed a space to record that a person does not have diabetes. Dr. O appeared, and did a stint as data entry clerk. He flipped lenses and determined that my prescription has changed. He shined a beacon onto my retinas and scoured them for anomalies. At no time did anybody come in to check my blood pressure. Or even mention it again. Dr. O said that if I had brought a driver, he would dilate my eyes, but that since there was nothing remarkable about my exam, he didn't even think I'd need to come back another day for the dilation.So what's the deal with the blood pressure panic? I guess they get a finder's fee for any new diagnoses. Dr. O said that everybody has to do the new government information-gathering. Optometrists. Pharmacies. \"Even dentists?\" I asked.\"Well, probably not dentists.\"Pardon my French, but WTF? That stands for \"What the French?,\" right? Because if an optometrist has to take all that medical info, wouldn't it stand to reason that a dentist, who gouges and pokes and draws blood and gives shots and doles out pain pills more than an optometrist should be doing the same thing?I'm betting there's some kind of grant money involved here.

But I have responsibilities. Girly said that she had a 2:00 appointment on Thursday. Not what I'd hoped for, but I took it. I even repeated it back to her, and wrote it down. Then I called the office and arranged for a substitute. I typed up Thursday's lesson plan. Informed my students throughout the day that I would be gone. Just so they'd know what to expect. They are creatures of habit. No need to spring any surprises on them.Today I got home at 4:30 and saw the light flashing on my answering machine. Yes. We still have things like that here in Backroads. It was the optometrist's office, reminding me that I had an appointment tomorrow at 2:00 with Dr. X. Tomorrow is WEDNESDAY! I called them back. Relayed the info about my appointment. Told them in no uncertain terms that I would NOT be there Wednesday at 2:00, because I would be at work. Unlike Thursday, when I would be off. Because I had scheduled a substitute so I could go to my optometrist's appointment.Girly 2.0 declared that my appointment had been made for Wednesday. I told her I would not be there.

Mom changed her mind, and popped in later that afternoon.\"I know you probably won't give it to me because I don't have the card...but my daughter wanted me to pick up a package for her today.\" Mom gave him my name. A woman's name. Not the name on the package address.The man behind the counter smiled. \"Oh, she called.\" He disappeared into the back room. \"Here it is.\" He handed Mom Genius's package. No request for ID. No signature. Just shoved that package, a fancy schmancy camera lens, across the counter to her.Let the record show that I most certainly did NOT call the post office. I was working, by cracky. The last time I called a post office was to report kids pooping and wiping their butts on their underwear, and stuffing it into specific mailboxes, and bragging about it. That's a federal offense, you know. And for all my trouble trying to be an upstanding snitch and flag-waving citizen and a concerned villager trying to raise responsible children, I was given the runaround.

I suppose my mother herself could have called him, and pretended to be me, and described herself, and said that I wanted her to pick up that package.Here's what irks me. The last time I went to that post office, the dead-mouse-smelling one, and waited until the metal curtain was raised after the lunch shut-down, I was read the riot act. Even though I had my orange postcard notification thingy, and the clerk commented to me that I usually send in my sons to pick up the packages (so obviously she knew me), she told me that I needed identification.

If an old friend offhandedly mentions that she loves my mother's fudge, Mom whips up a batch and drives thirty miles to deliver it. Even though the recipient is not supposed to have fudge. When she has to call me at school about twice a year, she bends over backwards to thank the secretary. Which brings us to today's tale.Genius was expecting a package to arrive at the post office Thursday. It contained a precious camera lens that he was itching to experiment with. Unfortunately, that was the day of the first meeting of the Academic Team. Genius and The Pony attended. I left school as soon as contractually possible to run errands two towns over. Genius planned to leave the meeting by 4:00, whether it was over or not, in order to dash into the post office before the 4:30 closing time.I mentioned the predicament to Mom Thursday morning. Sometimes she will pick up packages for us. I knew she had a doctor's appointment that day, but wondered if she could stop by on her way back through our town. Mom was concerned that she did not have time to get the orange package notification card from me. I told her not to worry, that Genius had an alternate plan. Thanks anyway.Seventh hour, the school secretary called to say that my mom was on the line, and she was transferring the call. Mom had picked up the package, a story for tomorrow's blog, and was planning to drop if off right after the final bell.Friday morning, Mom told me that she would be running over to school to give the secretary a little gift for being so accommodating. She was fresh out of Chex Mix, the bartering tool of choice, but had a chippy alternative. I told her that was thoughtful, but not necessary. That transferring that call was kind of what the job of school secretary entails. That this employee is paid a plum salary, with benefits, for doing that very thing. All day long. For many people. Not that I begrudge her a special treat. She is pleasant and efficient and very good at her vocation. Fantastic, actually. A better individual we could not possibly find to run that office.But Mom insisted. She drove over and delivered the treat. The mutual admiration society kicked into high gear, and I heard the details of the exchange separately from both sides. It was a real feel-good story. But here's the thing: Mom will not tip a waitress to subsidize a living wage. No matter how fantastic the service.Every time we go out, Mom leaves a tip of two dollars. No matter what the establishment. No matter what the service. No matter what the bill. Two dollars. And she thinks she is being kind. Generous. Doing the right thing. I would never tell her that she's not. It would hurt her feelings. Embarrass her. But it would not changer her tipping ways. Two dollars. No matter how much I explain that waitstaff do not even earn minimum wage. That they are expected to garner the difference in tips. And that they have to pay income tax on the minimum wage, even if they don't earn that much.Mom doesn't understand that, in effect, she is heaping extras upon one individual for simply doing her job, for which she is well-compensated...and neglecting one who does extra, like bringing a plate of pickles to the table for no charge, who skillfully treads the line between hovering and neglect, between friendly banter and smarmy solicitousness, all in hopes of upping her salary to minimum wage status.The elderly.

We had one give birth to triplets, and nothing ate them.\"\"Do they eat cedars?\"\"Oh, yeah! They'll eat the bark clean off.\"\"I have issues with cedars. I was five when I rode my first pony. It wasn't mine. My dad said, \"Jump on if you think you can ride it.\" And I did. And that led to me getting my own horse. I had to clear a field, and build a hay barn. Those cedars are hard to keep out of a field. The conservation department talked my mom and dad into starting a Christmas tree farm, with a plot of cedars. I have thirty acres.\"\"We have twenty together, and another ten up the road. My grandma and uncle used to have a Scotch Pine Christmas tree farm. My uncle worked for the conservation department. Goats will eat up small cedars, and strip that bark off the bigger ones. Then you can cut them and use them for posts!\"\"That sounds like a good idea. I saw some goats grazing from the highway, up by the sawmill.\"\"They'll clear things out. That's for sure.\"My stimulating conversation had to end when the clerk finished up with the old lady ahead of me. She kind of looked like Tweety's grandma. Bluish hair. Tiny thing.

It abuts the road. There's a part on top of a rolling hill, and a newer part that slopes toward the river, with a mausoleum. Every now and then I drive through, when I'm alone. My dad is buried there. You can't see him from the road.But what you CAN see from the road is the cemetery office. And what The Pony and I saw on that thunderstormy morning, through intermittent flashes of lightning, was a dark man. He slouched against the door. Like one of those wooden cowboy cutouts. Maybe you don't have them in the city. Dark man silhouettes, or those cowboy cutouts. I'm sure he was just another road-walker, caught in the downpour, looking to avoid the sluicing rainwater for a few minutes. But it was creepy to catch him out the corner of my eye. Of course I called his attention to The Pony. Why should I be the only one with nightmares?It would have been better if it was a road woman. One who looked like a bent-over, flowered-dress, yard lady flaunting her ample rumpus. She even has a name, you know. Backside Lady. And her measurements are 38, 26, 1/2. She would not have scared me, lurking there in the dark doorway of the cemetery office. Something like that would have given my dad a good laugh. He's the kind of guy who would ask for a Backside Lady to be placed on his cemetery plot. So you COULD see him from the road. And just to make people laugh.I got my sense of humor, walking that tightrope between socially acceptable and terribly inappropriate, from him.

Lightning darted from sky to ground like a lizard's tongue to a tasty insect. My cold, cold heart melted long enough to pull up to the back door of the school so The Pony could enter without waterlogging. First, I made him get an umbrella out of the back of the Tahoe for me. He leaned over the back seat and grabbed one. Silly me. I didn't look at it until I had driven back down to the end of the row to park.It was the lesser babka of umbrellas. I have a nice golf-style umbrella that has only been used a handful of times. The oneThe Pony left me was the red and royal blue alternating panel umbrella that no longer shoots open when the button is pushed. You have to shake it, like your fist at an angry mob. Then it slides open on its own sweet time. Oh, and the fabric is ripped from one of the metal spike thingies. So there's a gap in the canopy, and a flapping swatch of nylon.I bravely opened my car door and put out the umbrella. Pushed the button. Waited for it to unfurl. Rain sluiced down my arm like I was standing at the base of Niagara Falls. I started the long walk to the building. I felt like a cartoon pink hippo in a purple polka dot skirt, pirouetting in ballet slippers while holding a dainty parasol. Let's just say that Chris Farley's \"fat man in a little coat\" routine had nothing on my \"immense woman under a miniscule bumbershoot\" routine.Let the record show that I did not have on a purple polka dot skirt, nor ballet slippers, and that no actual pirouetting was involved."}, {"title": "The Barest Peace Treaty", "date": "Tuesday, September 25, 2012", "text": "Stop the presses!

As long as I don't exert myself too much in my dream life.For the past month, I have been playing Big Brother. The people in my dreams are different than those on the show. But I am still involved in scheming and skullduggery. Now that the finale has aired, my Big Brother dreams have settled down. Fallen by the wayside. Evicted themselves right out of my head. Until next July.Before those Big Brother dreams, I had the school dreams. I'm sure they will start up again. Many years ago, when I was a coach, and still single, I dreamed that two of my basketball players broke into my townhouse. They banged on the door until they broke it down, ran up the stairs to my bedroom, shook me awake, and demanded, \"Who's starting tomorrow night?\" It was quite vivid. I could have sworn they were really there. It was probably my crazy neighbor's Navy SEAL son home to visit who made all the thumping noises to start that sleepytime scenario.Last week, I had a doozy of a dream. I wasn't doing much of anything. Just looking at a diagram. A black and white diagram printed on a fold-out, rectangular piece of paper. It was a schematic drawing of a 1950s style long canister-shaped vacuum cleaner. The schematic did not show all of the attachments. Merely a hose with a standard flat end, a handle on top of the canister, and lines with labels pointing to the main parts.I tried to Google canister vacuum cleaners. The first image that came up was how my schematic looked. But Google showed way too many parts. And the shape of the vacuum was all wrong. Why would I have a vacuum in my dream? I surely wasn't using it. Am I meant to clean up after Mr. Sandman? Get rid of the dreams before I wake, so I feel refreshed?

She was quite knowledgeable in her subject matter. Gave a day-long PowerPoint presentation, with handouts, about the newest trend in Missouri public education. However...she might need to re-evaluate some of her examples. To better enable her to practice what she preaches. To walk the walk that goes with her talky talk.Here's the issue. One segment of the program was about connotations. How students should realize the effect that words have on an audience. How different forms of media use tactics to sway the viewers or readers. How a simple choice of words can determine whether people feel sympathy, indifference, or anger.Throughout the day, Speaky McSpeakerson posed questions. Made suggestions. After the first hour, I sensed a theme. It could not have been a subliminal message, because I noticed it. I'm sure it was not what Speaky intended. I present Exhibits A, B, C, D, and E.Exhibit ASpeaky referred to the current practice of schools receiving MAP testing scores in the fall, after students were tested in the spring. \"You know that when middle schools receive the coroner's report, it's too late. Their eighth graders are freshmen now, in another building. They can't help them.\"Exhibit BSpeaky declared that there's no need to teach the same thing over and over through the grade levels. Students know who won the Civil War. They know the battles. \"Rather than asking them to give the same old information, how about asking them to write a report. 'Have you ever been through a graveyard?'\"Exhibit CSpeaky said that you have to give students a decent topic so they have something to write about. \"You don't ask an elementary student to write an essay about 'Would you like to have a pet?' Of course they want a pet. Better to pose the question, 'Did you ever have a pet that died?'\"Exhibit DSpeaky explained that students should be expected to do more than enumerate facts. 'Don't ask them to name the characters in The Masque of the Red Death. Ask, 'Have you ever been to a funeral?'\"Exhibit ESpeaky purported that even young students can delve deeper into a story. \"Instead of asking, 'What color was Mary's dress?' ask 'Why did the guppy die?'\"After each new death reference, I turned to my right-hand tablemate. \"Why does she have to be so morbid?\" Once would have been enough. The example of test scores compared to a coroner's report was actually kind of appropriate.At the end of the session, Speaky passed out evaluation forms. There were bubbles to fill in with #2 pencils. Questions like whether Speaky was Very Unknowledgeable, Unknowledgeable, Neutral, Knowledgeable, or Very Knowledgeable in her subject matter. Then there was a space asking us to write a comment about Speaky's presentation. I told my right-hand tablemate that I had the perfect comment.\"You make me feel like I want to die.\"I didn't actually write that. I don't think Speaky would have gotten the point."}, {"title": "Mandatory Chair Time", "date": "Friday, September 21, 2012", "text": "I spent the day at a teacher inservice presentation. All day.

We'll work out the details later.The following conclusions were reached by Val today:* Teachers are often not the best pupils.Whispering, hooting, texting, and using outdoor voices is not appropriate in a workshop setting. * A simple explanation will suffice. There is no need for a superior to place a hand on one's shoulder/back area, as this can be construed as both condescending, and an invasion of personal space. BAD TOUCH!Don't cross that line. You might lose an arm. Or a lawsuit.* Milk on a table causes anxiety.The first thirty minutes of material will not be retained, due to everyone staring at the two gallons of milk beside the donuts, mentally tsk-tsk-ing about the waste. Until one brave little soldier got up and absconded with the jugs, presumably to the refrigerator in the teachers' workroom.* There are no mimosas on school property.Even though there is orange juice. Which really does not go with donuts.* Anti-Scientites must not be allowed to present workshops.Do not make fun of nonfiction books on coral reefs by saying, \"REALLY? Who cares?\" Do not belittle the science teachers by ridiculing volcanoes, of which there are three main types, required to be learned by freshmen for the Course Level Equivalents. And especially to not call out for a show of hands for all the English teachers. Then all the math teachers. Then all the history/social studies teachers. Then...oh...that's all.* Bashing of the sea cucumber is not becoming.We can't help it that you did poorly on that question on the writing portion of your ACT, and justified it by asking in your mind, \"You expect me to read a paragraph about a boring sea cucumber?\" If only schools had a fourth core class such as...oh...I don't know...maybe...SCIENCE, perhaps you would have been privy to the excitement a sea cucumber can bring when irritated, expelling its guts and all. Crazy idea, huh? That fourth core.* Common Core Standards are, quite simply, the same criteria and methods we used years ago,  when we called them Reading Across the Curriculum, and Writing Across the Curriculum, before gearing materials to the multiple-choice End Of Course tests.There.

Usually, she puts a styrofoam container in a Walmart bag, and hangs it on my door handle. She rings the doorbell, and leaves. Later, she calls to see how I liked it. This one time, she must have left me a cinnamon roll while I was out. I came home, and it was sitting on the porch in a piece of foil. A dog must have got ahold of it, because a corner of the foil was folded back. A bite was gone out of the cinnamon roll. I guess the dog didn't like it.What a crazy world we live in.

Dad had hit his foot with the axe, and cut off his big toe, right through the shoe. Mom hollered at me: 'Susie! Run in the house and get a baggie and some towels!' I ran in. The baggie was to put the toe in. Mom wrapped the towels around Dad's foot, and told me to put the toe in the bag. I said, 'Uh-uuhh.' Mom told me 'Just do it!' But I couldn't. It had big black hairs growing out of it. I didn't want to touch it. But Mom kept telling me we needed the toe.\"\"I went back in the house and got a pair of tweezers and picked up the toe by those hairs and put it in the baggie. Then Mom said to get some ice to put in it, and we put Dad in the car and took him to the emergency room. There was blood all over the towels.\"\"When we got there, they took him in and said they were glad we brought the toe. It took them a long time, but they sewed it back on.\"We were all on the edges of our seats, hanging onto every word. \"So he's still at the hospital?\" I asked.\"No, they let him come home. They gave him some pain medicine.\"\"They let him come home last night? Didn't they want to observe him after the surgery?\" I couldn't believe they didn't watch him closer--even though this was a hick-town hospital.\"No. They just stitched it back on in the emergency room. He said the pain medicine worked really good. But then last night he was supposed to keep it propped up, but he wanted some more ice to put in his soda.

He was not satisfied with his results, and plans to refine his process at a later date. Until then, he has graciously consented to share his first attempt.This is the set-up. He had already dismantled his rig, so he did not have a picture showing the speaker box and camera. He was going to snap a photo of that with one of his other cameras. The lesser babka of his picture-taker stable. So what we have here is a sliced-off section of a white balloon stretched over a mutilated red Solo cup, which is jammed into a wooden speaker out of range at the bottom of the pic. He used acrylic paint mixed with water. That's the main component that he wants to modify, to get just the right viscosity. And when he works out the bugs, he will put the whole thing in front of a black or white background, I'm sure. Depending on whether he uses the white or the black balloon.Here's what he's going after:He eventually wants to use multiple hues that shoot up independently. He gave it a try, but they ran together. He had taller columns, but I liked this one. Genius had to crop these photos so I could load them in less than thirty minutes apiece. My internet leaves a bit to be desired. So you're missing a part from the left edge that has balls of watery paint bouncing on the mini-lake of watery paint. Surface tension, you know. That's what surprised him, that the drops didn't flatten out into the lake upon contact, but bounced a couple of times, maintaining their spherical shape.Perhaps Genius will treat us to more colorful eye candy when he refines his techniques. He has more pressing things on his agenda tonight. Namely spending the night at a friend's house, eating pizza, taking photos with glow lights, and watching anime.

The Flamin' Hot chips are a red herring. That's what he likes to snack on through the week. Part of the Solo cup is jammed into an opening hacked into the wooden speaker. Part of a balloon is stretched over the opening in the Solo cup. A drop of water is applied to the top of the balloon rubber. The speaker is hooked up to music. The water bounces as the speaker vibrates.

The time has come to discuss a delicate matter. Of course, as a fragile Backroads flower, I am sorely vexed at the thought of somebody mistakenly assuming the topic is personal in nature. I assure you, it is a hypothetical scenario. Seriously.The business of education has gone haywire with supervisory tactics. Teachers must watch students like a cast of hawks. From the time they arrive in the morning, they are under surveillance. Duty teachers. Cameras. Hallway teachers. Classroom teachers. I'm surprised students are allowed to visit the restroom-without-a-door lacking a teacher in tow. Students are never to be left unattended.Suppose, hypothetically, of course, that a teacher comes down with a case of intestinal distress. Nothing like dysentery, mind you. More like a roaring bout of flatulence. Except it's not. Because the gas cannot escape. There is no window of opportunity. No instant when that teacher is student-free. Lunchtime has passed (unlike the trapped gases that percolate within that teacher's gut). The afternoon drags on. Four more classes. No breaks. Students must not be left unattended!What is that teacher to do? Sit on the cushiony rolly chair and trap it in while her innards roil with bubbles intent on escape? Take a chance on laughing, coughing, barking commands...knowing all the while that such an act could cause an unauthorized release? Try to let some pressure escape, hoping for silent but deadly rather than an ear-shattering PPPFFFTTT or BRRAAAPPPP or balloon-stem squeakage that will draw attention to herself?If only that hypothetical teacher could step out into the hall for a clandestine emission. But no. Students must not be left unattended! And a new camera has been installed ten feet from the classroom door, with a fisheye lens, no doubt, monitoring traffic in and out the main back door to the parking lot.The four minutes between classes is not an option. New students flood in before old students rush out. It's like they are waiting in starting blocks for the bell, in an effort to win the class-change gold medal. Standing in the hall between classes is not an opportune time for a gaseous release. Sure, it could be blamed on a passing student. But those entering the classroom would comment and question.At times, a teacher in distress must wish to jab a sharpened hollow instrument into her abdomen with the force a ten-year-old jabs that finely-honed plastic straw into a bag of Capri Sun.It's enough to make a teacher regret last evening's treat of a Fiber One fudge brownie.Hypothetically, of course."}, {"title": "My Wardrobe is Revolting", "date": "Wednesday, September 12, 2012", "text": "Don't call CPS on me.

He was a lithe, gangly man riding a bicycle with traffic. That meant he had no idea what kind of vehicle was about to obliterate him from behind, nor the speed of his imminent demise. Not that he cared. He pedaled, with white-leather-tennis-shoe-clad feet, nonchalantly down the middle of the blacktop lane, his slim legs encased in acid-washed skinny jeans, torso hugged by a skintight black turtleneck, close-cropped gray locks topped by a jaunty black beret. I swear I heard him singing Alouette. I am surprised he was not toting a canvas bag containing a small wheel of Camembert, with the end of a baguette poking out the top. He was happily ignorant of the long, open-trailer semi loaded with rock bearing down on him.I passed Jean Paul Pierre, then the oncoming truck.

Needing a release.We're talking about my kitchen sink. The one I need for washing dishes, having no newfangled appliance to do it for me. I am Wilma Flintstone with no prehistoric creature to perform such a chore for me. Not even a bird with a pointy beak to play sweet, sweet music on the phonograph record while I toil with my bare hands in a sink full of soapy water.It's an almond-colored sink. A double. Saturday morning, I could not make the water flow down the drain. Oh, water pretended to flow down the drain. Then it came up in the companion sink. The draining side. So I had two sinks full of water that would not drain. Unsavory water. I abhor wet food particles in a sink. I cringe to clean out the strainer plug thingamajig after each dish-washing session. The act makes me gag. Retch. Brings tears to my eyes. And I think I might utter, \"Icky, icky, icky,\" subconsciously as I rap that almond metal gunk-catcher against the side of the black-Glad-bag enrobed tall kitchen wastebasket. So to see such flotsam bobbing in the unyielding sink water was almost more than I could bear.I had noticed that the sink was draining slowly, and had stopped for some Liquid Plumr. It didn't work. So I picked up some Drano on my next trip to town. All those chemicals and some plunging when forbidden did nothing to alleviate my sink woes. Hick was thoughtlessly away at a school fundraiser picnic, selling barbecue. He called to check in on his goats, which The Pony was assigned to herd around the front yard of newly-sprouted green grass. I filled him in on the sink situation. \"I'll fix it,\" he said. Without malice. Without announcing his candidacy for martyrdom. Too easily.I was reminded of the plate I saw sitting next to the sink. A blue plastic plate with compartments that Hick had used for eating Chinese food Friday night. Hunan chicken, I believe. The plate was spotless except for a sheen of oil. Which smacks of Hick and his penchant for rinsing his plate under cold water without scraping it into the wastebasket first. Surely you weren't thinking we have a garbage disposal.Furthermore, I recalled that Hick had rinsed the large pot used in the making of chicken and noodles earlier in the week. It, too, was spotless. Except for the starchy lines along the sides from the boiling of the egg noodles. But it was bereft of noodle fragments and shredded chicken fibers.The most infuriating memory was of Hick's daily rinsing of his free-range chicken eggs. I try to block this habit from my mind. I've caught him at it too many times. The Pony collects the eggs in a little red-and-green wicker Easter basket. He sets them on the counter for Hick to inspect. Hick runs cold water over them, then dries them with a paper towel and puts them in an egg carton in the bottom of the refrigerator. He is careless in his sanitary measures. At least twice a week, I find a chicken feather on the kitchen floor. I am constantly scrubbing my sink with Comet before I wash the dishes.I am sure my sink was clogged with enough noodle fragments, Chinese vegetable particles, and chicken feathers to weave a warm winter coat.Yes. I blame Hick. The sink worked before those incidents. If he would eat at a normal hour, I could do the kitchen clean-up per my stringent regulations. Such as using only hot water for rinsing, and rinsing AFTER plates are scraped over the wastebasket or off the back porch.The sink is working again. For now. At first Hick refused to tell me how he cleared it. Then he said he used the plunger. Even though the abrasive nonworking uncloggers had forbidden plunging. Even though I had already endured and Olympic-caliber workout of plunging. I have no idea what he really did. Once before, he said he cleaned out the trap.I suppose he's making himself indispensable so I'll keep him around. But if I didn't keep him around, I wouldn't need him to unclog the sink.It's a real O.

And as a teacher, I am a consumer of dry erase markers. Not a consumer, as in ingesting them to metabolize for energy to carry out my life processes. Oh, did I mention that I teach biology? I think I did. By consumer, I mean that I buy them with my own money to use in the education of your children. That's a collective your. Don't get all panicky and think, \"Children? What children? I don't have any children. That I know of.\"My consumption of markers is not as robust as it used to be. Back in the days when I taught smaller, more hands-on classes of at-risk youth, assisting them with their algebra needs, I went through a lot of markers. Working problems on the board with different colors for variables and coefficients can unlock the mystery of letters in math equations for some individuals. Allowing students to write out their problems on the board can assist the kinesthetic learners. And others can follow along and see mistakes as they happen. Everybody is at the same level. One big not-quite-happy family, working together to solve algebraic equations on the white board.But I'm not here to wax poetic on my algebra-teaching acumen. The point is that kids are rough on dry erase markers, leaving the caps off, jamming them into the white board within inches of their fume-emitting lives, dropping them frequently, stacking them together cap-to-end until they have a three-foot multicolored pointer, etc. Now that I rarely let students write on my white board, my markers last longer. Especially when I only put out two on the chalk tray at a time. But they DO wear out from my own daily use.I picked up a starter pack of dry erase markers a couple of weeks ago. I needed a new eraser. And I needed a bottle of cleaning spray. Of course Walmart was low on dry erase supplies due to every elementary school teacher in the state of Missouri requesting dry erase markers from each student on their back-to-school supply list. I wish high school teachers could get a piece of that action.Expo, the teacher's pal, was not in evidence. The pegboard was bereft of Expos. But I snagged a Quartet starter pack. Four markers, an eraser, and a small bottle of cleaning spray. Just what I needed, I assumed. No need to grab a large pack with neon colors that kids can't read from the back row. Black, red, green, and blue are good enough for me. Blue for physics, green for biology, red for test dates, and black for special emphasis.I am not singing the praises of this Quartet. Quartet is the cinnamon babka, The lesser babka of the dry erase marker bakery. Expo is the chocolate babka that everybody craves and raves about. I can't wait for my Quartet to be consumed or grow stale enough to discard. Oh, they write adequately enough. But they refuse to be erased. They leave ghosts on my white board. I am not enamored of the daily spray-cleaning this Quartet requires. They are as high-maintenance as a spoiled debutante. Give me the old blue-collar Expos any day.Along with the unpleasant after-image, the Quartet further annoys me by playing hard-to-get. Their lids require two empty hands for removal. Not one empty hand and another clutching a sheaf of papers or a water cup or a stack of ISS assignments. The cap of the Quartet is akin to a chastity belt. Their daily deflowering is almost not worth the effort. I suspect that my Quartet will be smashed in a fit of rage before they dry out. I grudgingly wrestle some board writing out of them every morning. I can't just toss them out like a baby with the bathwater.It's not like throwing away the school's money."}, {"title": "What We Have Here is an Exposed Jugular", "date": "Friday, September 7, 2012", "text": "Oh, dear.I have stumbled upon another unintentional misuse of a common word.

In a small rural school, where everybody knows everybody. Where your fellow faculty step in when needed, and mind their own beeswax when not. Where administration, faculty, staff, and students pull together for the good of the cause, one for all and all for one. Where lunch in the cafeteria is a pleasant interlude from hard-core learning. A place to relax. To let your hair down. Enjoy the company of your peers. Safely. While ingesting wholesome food to fuel your brain for the afternoon ahead.I once thought as much.Today we sat at our faculty lunch table in the cafeteria, discussing the relative merits of our incoming freshmen. A feisty group. Yet not unpleasant. And then it happened.I felt an impact on my upper left arm. The place right beside the fatty part that jiggles when I wave along the parade route, unless I take my teaching buddy Mabel's advice, and give the royal wave. I looked to determine the severity of my injury, only to see a thin red liquid coursing down my arm. Thin rivulets. With shrapnel. The sleeve of my shirt was stained. The teacher next to me gasped. She tried to stem the flow of fluid. Dabbed at it with a napkin. \"I am SO sorry!\"The rest of the table laughed. Hee hawed, actually. Belly laughed. Brayed like donkeys. Made light of my misfortune. Students at the table next to us, my last-year's charges, snickered openly.I had been tomatoed. My second-cousin-about-to-be-removed had chomped down on a grape tomato, and sprayed the living daylights out of it. Right onto my arm. Good thing for her. The principal was on her other side. Does one not chew with one's mouth closed any more? Is the force of a single grape tomato so powerful that it explodes out of one's tight-lipped mouth?I looked to the left. To the right. I know how Carrie felt on prom night. Yet there were no doors for me to slam telekinetically. So I used my words.\"Is it too much to ask that I be able to dress in regular clothes at work? I had no idea this morning that my wardrobe should have been that of a person with front-row tickets to a Gallagher performance.\" I turned to my former relative. \"Your jaws have the power of a hefty wooden mallet.\"I completed my day in soiled clothing.

On a blind uphill curve, with a long semi loaded with rock bearing down on me from the oncoming lane, The Road Barrier and I became acquainted. He scuffed along in the middle (yes, I said THE MIDDLE) of my traffic lane, even though a five-foot swath of only partially-littered wet grass was available for his transportation needs. He did not deign to turn. To meet my eye over his shoulder. On he plodded, giving no quarter, insouciantly swinging his see-through grocery sack, two apples swaying like fake testicles on the tow-hitch of a rebel-flag-decaled pickup truck. Apparently, he had missed the memo: roads are not for walking.The Road Barrier gave not a smidgen. Not a skosh. He owned that piece of pavement, by cracky, and was yielding for no vehicle. I slammed on my anti-lock brakes. Came to a complete stop. In the road. On a blind uphill curve. To keep from killing him.

Knick-knacky items. He figured there must be mice running around up there. He's had them before, you know. Most notably the time he found them inside the pockets of his coveralls. Hairless, pink, blind, baby mice. Plunged his hand right into their midst. To hear Hick's older boys tell it, \"Dad jumped up and down, ripped off those coveralls, and screamed like a little girl.\" So the idea that there might be furry brown fully-grown field mice in his tricked-out loft did not cause him to panic.To further fuel his suspicions, he had found that his gimcracks were, indeed, on the floor. And this morning, he found something else. Under his workbench, downstairs.\u00a0In case you can't tell from The Pony's phone pic, that's a five-foot snakeskin. The thing about a five-foot snakeskin is that the snake is bigger than five feet now. Hick thinks the original owner of that skin was a black snake. Or black rat snake, but nobody around here uses its proper name. Hick reports that in spite of the toppled tchotchkes, he has actually seen only a couple of mice in the barn. So he figures the skin-shedder was laying in wait along the mouse path.Just so you don't think Hick is pulling a fast one, here's another photo, showing both ends of the skin.This picture also includes The Pony's finger. Or perhaps an ominous entity. Or a magical red dot. Glass half full or half empty, I suppose. That backdrop is our old heating/cooling unit that was just replaced. Because why throw away something that doesn't work, when you could store it in the BARn to use as a backdrop for a five-foot snakeskin?Yes, the BARn proper is not up to the standards of the BARn loft. I suppose that's a working chainsaw and a nonworking chainsaw. A chair I've never seen before, which points to something being thrown away at Hick's work. The measuring implement is a survey pole, though nobody here has ever worked as a surveyor. Under a gray tarp in the back is a 1970s Ford pickup without a bed. I'm expecting those American Pickers to drop in any day now.There are no plans to evict our reptilian squatter. Hick was a bit apprehensive about the skin being light-colored from a black snake, until I told him that was normal. He declared that if it came from a copperhead, we were gonna catch it, by cracky, and become rich for owning the world's largest copperhead. Yes. He has delusions of grandeur. Surely he must know that we will become rich after my as-yet unwritten book hits #1 on the New York Times bestseller list.While I wait for that to happen, I'm going to see if we can't find a cousin of Mr. Five-Foot-Plus Black Snake to take up residence in our garage."}, {"title": "Putting the Freeloaders Back to Work", "date": "Saturday, August 25, 2012", "text": "Hick is displeases with our felines. Or, as he calls, them, \"YOUR cats.\"It's not like these cats are my sole pleasure in life. Like I sought them out for companionship. Lay around stroking their soft, soft fur while they caress me with their sandpapery tongues. No. I accepted one for each son from a teacher with two litters to disperse, and rescued three from the woods by the mailbox. They were duly wormed and vaccinated, and each received that very special operation to prevent proliferation. Now they roam about the grounds, drape themselves bonelessly over the porch furniture, and totally ignore us. Run from us, even. Except for Genius's cat, also named Genius, an orange tabby.During the cooler months, our herd of cats takes up residence in the rafters of the garage. Hick has put down plywood across the trusses. Not for the cats' pleasure. For storing the yard Santa, the fake Christmas tree, tubs of who-knows-what, and pet carriers. When not tightropewalking along the two-by-fours, dangling tails off the plywood platforms, or sharpening their claws on a piece of carpet remnant, these thankless freeloaders pace back and forth across the hood of my black Tahoe. At least that's what I deduce from the footprints. When I pull into the garage, my heart is often stopped by the PLUNK of a cat onto the roof. I'm a stepping-stone, you see. From plywood to beam to open garage door to Tahoe roof to Tahoe hood to floor. It's a choreographed critter ballet.The cats don't drop onto Hick's roof. His Pacifica has a lower profile. Last week, Hick took exception to our less-than-loving felines. \"I'm gonna kill me a couple of cats.\" Knowing Hick, I did not take this literally. First, he would have to catch them. Then get them away from the house to fill them with lead. Then bury the carcasses. So I figured what he was really trying to say was, \"I am totally pissed to the max at these darn cats!\"When further questioned about the issue, Hick revealed the catalyst for his comment. \"I pulled into the garage and sat in my car for a minute. I thought I saw something out of the corner of my eye. I waited. There is was again. A mouse running up and down the wall! Those lazy cats need to start killing the mice! What's the use of a cat if it won't kill mice?\"My cats used to kill mice. Really. They would play with it a while before one of them ate it. And they always left the liver on the porch.

In fact, last night all three turned down a salad with their baked chicken and potatoes. Far be it from Val to waste food. She enjoyed her own salad, thank you very much. No need to even put theirs in a bowl, just to throw it out. Because salad mailed to starving children overseas does not travel well. Which brings me back to the topic of tonight's supper and the garlic knots.Don't be thinkin' Val tied up her own knots after grinding grain into flour, setting dough aside to rise, crushing garlic harvested from her own garden, and churning some fresh butter to melt on top. We won't even go into the aging of the parmesan cheese until it was mature enough to sprinkle over the knots. That's not how Val rolls.I bought a dozen garlic knots from a student for a fundraiser last fall. It must have been one of the cheaper items in the brochure, because my kids have only had garlic knots once. At a restaurant. It's not like they clamor for them. They were more likely to eat the knots than a strudel or a fancy pie.My garlic knots arrived on the day of parent conferences. The day when school let out at 1:00, but faculty had to stay until 6:00. My mom came by to pick up The Pony so he wasn't home alone with Genius, ripe for the picking-on. I asked her to take my cardboard box of garlic knots for safekeeping. They were frozen, you know. Of course, the students picked up their items around 11:00, and traipsed about the building delivering them willy-nilly. Mom drove them to her house and put them in the freezer. Then took them out and I drove them home with The Pony, where we put the knots in our own freezer. There they languished until yesterday.I knew I had knots in the freezer. They were in the way, actually. Many a time I planned to serve them, only to spot them as I was gathering my cooking implements for the current meal. The directions on a sticker on the cardboard box said to thaw them at room temperature before cooking. Like I had time for that. I set them out on the counter while cleaning out the freezer before shopping. I meant to cook them last night. I had put them in the fridge, and forgot them. So I hauled them out tonight. I had dubious hopes of rising knots.Genius spied them on the stovetop as I was warming the oven. \"Hey! These look great!\"\"They're not cooked yet. I don't think they'll rise. They might break your teeth.\"\"I don't care. How many can I have?\"\"Well, I don't want any. And your dad shouldn't have many. There's garlic dipping sauce. And parmesan to sprinkle on.\"\"They look really good.\"\"Let's put them in the oven.\"Of course the knots didn't rise. They looked even smaller when they came out seven minutes later. I rubbed the knot-tops with butter. Sprinkled the parmesan. And called the boys. It was like tossing toast crumbs to fish. They swarmed that pan. I stepped back, lest I incur an injury. When the parmesan had cleared, Genius had five, and The Pony had four. They each took a dipping sauce.Genius declared that only the outside was hard as a rock. The inside was good. That I should try a bite. He ripped off a miniscule portion. Even offered to dip it for me. I declined. It tasted like a soft pretzel. I might just as well have cooked them with a little sea salt on top. I love pretzels!The Pony announced that the knots were delicious. Especially with the sauce. Both boys decreed that more should be purchased through the next fundraiser.

But we both know that it's a hobnob born of necessity.Yes, the basis of my mediocre popularity is the fact that my tiny portion of public school real estate sits inside the double fire doors. The ones that slam shut automatically when the alarm sounds. I am near the offices, restrooms, cafeteria, and teacher workroom. I am a way station. A place to hang out while waiting for someone more desirable to pass along the route. A place to borrow educational implements forgotten way down at either end of the hall. To take an unplanned sojourn before reapplying one's nose to the grindstone.Some colleagues see my little workstead as the last outpost before embarkation on the Educational Trail. A place to load up on staples (both literal and figurative) that are in short supply. And they don't want to barter with their grubstake. They have sadly mistaken me for a mission. But I offer neither handouts nor religious tracts. So they take. Steal me blind without even pulling the wool over my eyes. Steal while I am watching.Tonight at open house, for instance, I lost a desk. But I knew the wily sidewinder who absconded with it. Because he sent a young apprentice to do his dirty work. Don't you worry none about Val's classroom furniture.I stole it back one minute before go-home time. It's safely locked away in my hub."}, {"title": "Free is Free", "date": "Monday, August 13, 2012", "text": "Today was my first day back at school.My ample posterior sat through a whirlwind of meetings. Then it sat through some more. And in one of them, I almost won a prize. Never mind that I didn't know what the prize was. I wanted it. The same as everyone else in the room wanted it. You could slap a pair of googly eyes on a cow pie, and teachers would clamor to win it. Because it's FREE STUFF! We'll find a use for it later. I would like to say that my MENSA-level IQ and savvy gaming strategy led to my near-victory. But the Truth in Blogging Law puts the kibosh on that. The contest that I exited with only three players left was a battle of wits called BEAR/MAN/GUN. Perhaps you've heard of it. Now don't go thinking you can buy this game at Target. No. There is no board. No game pieces. You play it with your noggin and your appendages. Kind of like George Costanza treating his body like an amusement park. But not quite.Most people would liken this sport to ROCK/PAPER/SCISSORS. But that's not violent enough. We are teachers, doggone it. We are tougher than the tools of our trade. The basic premise is:BEAR beats MANMAN beats GUNGUN beats BEARYeah. So at the end of the technology portion of our meeting, we took five minutes to battle each other to the death. Figuratively, of course. Again, I would like to say that my MENSA-level IQ and savvy gaming strategy led to my near-victory. But the truth is, I had never played this game, so my main method of participation was getting the proper display of appendages in my head, and whirling around to spring it on my unsuspecting opponent.Hey, y'all. I went out in a blaze of gunslinging glory, beaten by a man.Too bad, so sad. I almost had that prize in my hot little hand. I couldn't wait to tell Genius about it when I got home.\"Hey, I almost won a thing at school.\"\"Great. What was it?\"\"I'm not really sure. My buddy told me it was like a baby laptop. I think it's called a notepad.\"\"Um. I think you mean a netbook.\"\"Yeah! That's it! I almost won a netbook!\"I wonder why he walked off shaking his head. It's not like I would have known how to use it. He could have been the proud owner of a free notepad. Notebook. Baby laptop.

It's a recent affectation. And not a conscious decision. I am, in fact, a reluctant exhibitionist. I try to keep my peccadillo out of the public domain. Well, except for blogging about it. But seriously, how many people could possibly be reading this? Unless there are a lot of freaky folks who consult their BFF, Google, in search of exhibitionists.It is not my intention to seek out an audience and wow them with glimpses of my flesh. Sometimes, stuff just happens. The whole issue was actually initiated by accident, in the kitchen, with a drawer knob. No need to play a whole came of Clue for this culprit.I have a favorite pair of special at-home relaxation pants that I slip into when I am not entertaining guests. They are capri in nature, gray, with a wide, two-tone lavender stripe down the outer leg area. They can be seen in full-figured women's catalogs under exercise wear. They are quite comfortable, and the color scheme really sets off my black men's socks and red Crocs. I'm sure I'm a topic of conversation amongst home-delivery drivers and air conditioner repairmen throughout the county. Even more so lately.I am a fairly tall woman. Not petite. No gymnast bone structure here. I can reach the top cabinet shelves without a stepstool. And it's the dastardly cabinets that have made me an exhibitionist. Not so much the upper echelon cabinets as their drawers. Many's the time I have walked through my kitchen, minding my own business, gathering items for lunch-packing, when I have been brought up short by an unwelcome knob protruding into my personal space. Stopping me in my tracks. Hooking the pocket of my work and town pants. Requiring me to back up and unhitch.My special pants have no pockets. But they have worn thin at the side pocket area. That's because I wear no chef's apron. Are you kidding me? I am not a chef! I merely warm up food in the microwave, or heat it in the oven. According to Hick. So when I wash my hands at the kitchen sink, I sometimes blot them on my pants sides. Saves a paper towel. It's not like I could hang a kitchen towel from those grabby drawer knobs.And here we are again at the root of the problem. Those confounded drawer knobs. They snare the stitching between my two lavender stripes. After repeated molestings, my stripes have been stripped. A small hole appeared first. A small hole in my side-pants attracted those voracious drawer knobs like beef jerky attracts Sasquatch. It's not like I was messin' with the drawer knobs. I wasn't pranking them like Ashton Kutcher in a trucker cap. I wasn't teasing them like a laser light in front of a kitten. I wasn't enticing them like Sirens singing to sailors along a rocky shoreline. Those drawer knobs were attracted to my special pants like iron shavings are attracted to the red plastic wand in a Wooly Willy game.After repeated gropings, the small hole was stretched into gargantuan proportions. I try to cover the gaping pants-wound with the side of my big shirt. But sometimes, an unsuspecting observer becomes privy to more of Val's private hip-skin than anyone needs to see. I try to soften the shock to their system by wearing undergarments the color of the stripes or the pants proper.

But of course I'll mention it. Val would never let a fright get in the way of unraveling a good yarn.I piloted my large SUV down the blacktop county road as I do every day, at least once. As we approached the low-water bridge, I pointed out to The Pony that the pair of roaming geese were not in their field. Neither were they on the road. So I was wary. That meant they were either floating along in the creek, or chillin' on the bridge.It's a blind approach to that low-water bridge. Not on a curve. The road is ruler-straight. But it dips. Like one of those pretty pastel rubbery rulers that are flexible and can be whipped and whapped and leave a welt on an unsuspecting victim. Hypothetically, of course. This road dip at the edge of the bridge can be quite a problem in times of high water, because you cannot see if water is over the bridge until you are within ten feet of it. And if it is, you must put your large SUV in reverse, and back up for about a quarter mile to a turnaround driveway.So I crept toward the bridge slowly this morning, lest the pair of geese be sitting in the middle. Oh, the geese were there. Toward the left side. One was sitting, kind of impersonating a swan. And the other was standing. That's when I saw the bone-chilling, nerve-wracking, tooth-chattering, silent scream of a sight:That goose only had one leg!!!Yikes! It was all I could do to drive by without losing a wheel over the other side. I couldn't shield The Pony. He insists on riding behind me, rather than in the shotgun position. Like I'm a common chauffeur, or perhaps to glide his window down one day at a stoplight and request some Grey Poupon. And The Pony was already looking for the geese, because I had so kindly pointed out that they were not in the field or on the road.The more I gawked, the more I was relieved that the wound was not messy. No bloody stump. It was as if a goose surgeon had been flown in, perhaps in formation, to perform the amputation. I could not help but feel responsible. Had not I needed the Freon Chef to return to my abode yesterday? The one who handed me the yellow bill. That was not from a fowl? Now this silly goose was missing a leg. Coincidence, perhaps?That gander stood there. On one leg. Not teetering. Very stable. The Pony asked how it could stand up from sitting position with only one leg. \"Oh, geese. They have a good sense of balance. They're like the gymnasts of the avian world.\" Anything to keep The Pony's mind off the atrocity most likely committed by our very own air conditioner repair man.\"Um. Mom? His leg is not missing. It's up under his body, keeping warm. Our chickens do that sometimes.\"Never mind."}, {"title": "A Real Pain in my HPICCET", "date": "Friday, August 10, 2012", "text": "Here I sit, licking my wounds.

Wounds inflicted by the breakdown of my Heat Pump Inside Cooling Coil Element Thingamajigger that was apparently just fine one short week ago, so fine that he had an appetite for two pounds of Freon.Funny how after forking over the dough for that feedbag, my HPICCET suddenly took ill. Gluttony is not pretty. And is not cheap. The Freon Chef returned this morning to see what he hath wrought. It seems that my HPICCET has an inoperable ailment. The only cure is a transplant. Have you checked into the price of HPICCET transplants lately? To grind salt into the gaping wound, HPICCET has a pre-existing conditon. He has already reached the cap on his warranty, having required a major procedure some years previous.Now the dilemma. To secure a transplant for HPICCET to the tune of $1500 with a warranty of one year, or put him down along his entire unit, and welcome a new inside cooling unit into our home for an adoption fee of $1800. Yes. Tough choice. But we have chosen to euthanize HPICCET.Even more depressing than the low blow to our semi-deep pockets, and the loss of our fickle HPICCET, is the fact that the adoption process will take three days.

I often ask that of my students. I write the basics of the day's assignment on the whiteboard for them to gander at while I'm in the hall looking for speeders and lovers and horseplayers. When the bell rings, I walk to the board, point to the assignment, and ask which they want first. Most often, they request the bad news. Except for those cockeyed optimists who live with the hope that a sudden snowstorm, earthquake, or fire drill will disrupt the lesson before class time is over. The good news is usually that they may have a partner to work with. The bad news is that a worksheet is two-sided, or must be turned in before they leave class, or that there will be a quiz on the material the next day. C'mon. It's not like I'm giving away cash and prizes, or taking their firstborn child.So...in keeping with my most common request, I'll give the bad news first: a submission costs $22. But the good news is that you may earn $250 if your story is selected. If you're good at writing succinct stories with a beginning, middle, and end, and have reaped success with prior publishing credits, this may be for you. Or not. Depends if you want to pay to enter.

The company of my indentured servants was required. And wouldn't you know it, I learned something within the walls of that bastion of knowledge. My sons are the Alf and Ralph Monroe of classroom organization.You would think that two strapping teenage boys (sorry, not saying which one is Ralph) would knock out brainless, menial tasks forthwith. But you would be wrong. Because they truly appeared to be completing their tasks brainlessly. It took twice the time I would have needed to do it myself, had I been two strapping teenage boys.We had three goals. Make sure that all of my teacher property had been put back into MY room after the summer scouring and polishing. Rearrange the furniture to the floor plan that was in place when I walked out the door in May. Put out the two sets of textbooks, in number order, so they could be checked out to students in the most orderly manner.The first goal was easy enough. All items but one were present and accounted for. First time ever! Not a component was missing, except for a mouse. Accomplishing the second goal was like working one of those crazy plastic math puzzles with the sliding tiles. Move five things to make room for the one you need to set in place first.I directed them, of course. But they are somewhat like their father, in that there is only one way to do things, which is their own way, not mine. The file cabinet, for example. Most people understand that a four-drawer file cabinet full of files is heavy. That it can't be carried. That it requires a hand truck, which around here we just call a dolly. Genius sent The Pony to acquire the dolly. Which he found in the closet right next to my room. And here's where we diverged in our plan.I told Genius to have The Pony help him move the file cabinet away from the wall a few inches. They could have tilted it and \"walked\" it forward a bit. But no. Genius rammed the dolly under the side of the file cabinet, and tried to wheel it across the room to an adjoining wall. File Cabinet was having none of that. There was no room for his sharp, angular corners when the dolly wheels tried to change course. So Genius rammed File Cabinet forward and backward, trying to turn him all the while. Gouging and scraping the white-painted concrete-block wall that separates me from the classroom next door. The Pony and I watched in horrified fascination.\"Well. I suppose I will have to explain why there is a tunnel from my room to the Spanish room now. And in the future, please remind me not to ask you for help in re-stocking my china shop.\"Goal Three was an exercise in inefficiency. Genius messed with the bookcase shelving, skewing the unskewed, then exposing my false bottom. I put The Pony in charge of shelving and stacking, and Genius in charge of dragging stacks of books out from the bottom of the wooden cabinets. They were somewhat in order. But I knew from experience that even if they were stacked numerically, taking them out gets books out of order. They have the numbers on the bottom of the pages. So they can be seen quickly in a stack. But nobody drags ten texts at a time out from the bottom shelf. Except Genius. Who then told The Pony, a teenager of younger years and less musculature, to shelve them. I feared a hernia in the making.The Pony gamely hauled huge stacks to the shelves and to the line of extra desks along the new wall tunnel area. He put them in proper order. They were already in piles of tens, twenties, thirties, etc. Up to the eighties. He got ahead of Genius. And then I saw the problem. Genius was crawling back into the depths of the bottom cabinet area, stacking books in numerical order before taking them out. When it would have been so simple to set out a stack, and let The Pony order them as he re-stacked. Because Genius is all about doing things the only way he can imagine them done.I was glad to have the help, though. Even when Genius carried my roll of black paper that I use for blocking the front window when winter nears, so students can see my projector screen without sunny glare. Had he asked for my guidance, I might have suggested cradling it like a baby, or pinching it between thumb and forefinger to hold the roll while bringing it to the back corner by my desk for safekeeping. Rather than shoving an arm in the middle of the roll, then whipping it around while shouting, \"Wee! Wee! Wee!\" like Maxwell, the Geico pig.

I am not responsible for the medical bills of those who just fainted or split open their chin(s) as they dropped to the floor. Toughen up, buttercups. Or bandage your own wounds.One of our dogs, Tank the beagle, has been having issues. He acts like something is hurting him. Writhes on his back. Bites at his nether region. Yelps for no apparent reason. So I made him an appointment with our vet. He hasn't been in a while. Because it costs more to get your dog a check-up than it does for your kid.Hick got up early, hunted down the dog, crated him, and drove him to the vet for his 8:45 appointment. Seems that all Tank has wrong with him is a bad flea infestation. I suppose Vet would know. She stuck her finger up his butt and everything. Much to Tank's dismay. Hick had to hold him while he snarled. He's a testy one, that Tank. He still has all his parts, if you know what I mean. Normally, our pets have that very special operation, but Tank has papers, and thus escaped the knife. He's kind of a masculine hot-head at times.Hick was a bit surprised. He told Vet, \"But I put Frontline on him!\" According to Vet, it has to be Frontline PLUS. Or else the flea eggs are not killed. She shaved a patch off Tank's back to get a good look at his doggy scalp. Now Tank has three kinds of medicine, and an Rx for a good old-fashioned bath. Vet advised that the water will turn red, from the flea detritus that coats Tank's skin. Hick asked why the other two dogs who run with Tank are not having this problem. Vet said they are probably infested also, but that Tank must have an allergy to the fleas.Don't that beat all? A dog, allergic to fleas! And it only cost us $142.03 to find out! That's 177.5 Diet Cokes! Not that I begrudge my pet proper medical care. Even though that's almost half a year's worth of soda. And Tank is not even my favorite dog.After Hick medicated Tank and turned him loose, he went to help one of his older sons move. Then he came back home, grabbed the keys to my Tahoe, and took it to find out why the right rear tire loses four pounds of air a week. Even though he told me last week that the tire people would never be able to find such a slow leak. But they DID! Said it was a loose valve stem. Supposedly fixed it. But like Hick said, he took it to Walmart, so we need to watch it and make sure that was really the problem.But the sweetest babooish thing my Hick did for me today was bring me a 44 oz. Diet Coke when he returned with my Tahoe!I am a very lucky woman."}, {"title": "Road House, but Without Patrick Swayze", "date": "Friday, August 3, 2012", "text": "Did you ever have one of those days, where it seems like everybody's gettin' on your case?

Or a hanger-outer in boys' rooms.It all started innocently enough. But because you know that the universe conspires against Val, you know there's more to this story than a trip to town to drop The Pony off at his grandma's house. We called first to let her know that we would be arriving in about thirty minutes. The plan was to pick up a 44 oz. Cherry Diet Coke for her, and grab a sausage biscuit for Genius at the drive-thru. The Pony required no sustenance, thoughts of his imminent diet of Grandma's love already filling the void inside him.I breezed through the soda bar, only to end up in line at the register behind a man buying a six-pack of beer and four dollars worth of lottery tickets. AT 9:30 IN THE MORNING! I know. Some people just can't put off their lottery tickets until a reasonable hour. A kid was ahead of me, too. Waiting for his brohans to pump some gas into a Mustang convertible. Twenty dollars worth of gas. Big spender. It takes eighty-eight dollars to fill up my Tahoe. Getting out of that parking lot was a bear. A snarly, tooth-gnashing, in-need-of-anger-management grizzly bear. Because there's road construction in that area, you see.The roads were full of people who don't know how to drive as well as I do. Twenty mile per hour people in fifty-five zones. People with burned-out signal and tail lights who turned without signals. People with signal lights who were saving them for some grand occasion, who simply stopped in the middle of the road. Then turned. Cars swerving over the center line, then pulling off on the shoulder. Trucks. And that was just on the way TO Grandma's house.I'll save the piece de resistance for the finale. So pardon me if I get a bit out of order. Put the cart before the horse. On the way home, I popped in to get my own soda. I went to the gas station chicken store, because, well, I didn't want those other people thinking I had already drank one 44 oz. Cherry Diet Coke and I was returning for another one. That's almost as bad as buying lottery tickets at 9:30 a.m.Of course I got in line behind a chicken lady. She had four legs plus an eight-piece box. But I'm not one to ridicule people for their unconventional body composition. Her man had been pumping gas. He came in and grabbed his soda, making the checker all antsy waiting for Chicken Lady to pay. Of course she had to wait for her order to be boxed separately. Then she wanted five lottery tickets and five more of a different kind. She had gas. Plus the two sodas. And she pulled out her check book. Asked the checker her last name. Like she was writing a personal check. Then she asked the date, which was hanging on the wall. Then she grabbed the checker's pen, with the white plastic spoon taped on it for scratching off the verification on scratch-off tickets. And Chicken Lady proceeded to write out her check. Which she could have done while waiting in the chicken line.Upon leaving the gas station chicken store and heading towards home, I hit three red lights. Of course I did. But while cruising under the overpass, the car in front of me made a U-turn. No signal, mind you. Just veered across the left turn lane, the opposite left turn lane, and into the going-the-other way lane. So I moved on up behind a twenty-mile-per-hourer, who got into the left turn lane by my first soda stop store, and stayed in the left turn lane. In spite of the fact that the turn lane came to an inverted V and then disappeared. On an uphill stretch. Just kept driving in the darn-tootin' middle of the road. I slowed way down to give it room. That car had a handicap parking tag hanging from the mirror. The driver was using one hand to steer, gesturing wildly in conversation with a burning cigarette in the other. Then, you might have guessed, came to a stop in the middle of the road. And made a right turn.But this, THIS is the grandaddy of all incidents on today's ill-fated trip:That's a road house. A house. In the road. On the main thoroughfare from my mom's house. I had to drive in the opposite lane to get around it. I really wanted this picture. So I went around the block. Yes. Now those folks who snicker that Val has certainly been around the block a time or two are validated. I am not one to endanger the welfare of others by slamming on my brakes and stopping to take a photo. So I stopped at this side-street stop sign. Looks like that house had a flat tire.I know what you were thinkin'. That darn Val has been wicked-witching herself all over Backroads again, stealing ruby slippers, and this time, the house just missed her. C'mon.

I'm not trying to sound like Andy Rooney. He didn't copyright those words. A lot of people say, \"Did you ever notice...?\" Like Jerry Seinfeld, for instance. But I'm not trying to emulate either one. I don't have the eyebrows. Or the horse face, flared nostrils, and big teeth.Some people would not accept responsibility if it came with a cash award and a gold-plated statue. Everything is always somebody else's fault. I call them the \"If...then...I guess\" people.\"Well, IF you think I hurt your arm when I twisted it behind your back and it popped and the x-rays showed a fracture so the doctor put you in a cast, THEN I GUESS I'm sorry.\"Not that my arm is in a cast or anything. That's simply an example of the lengths people go to in avoiding responsibility. I might just as well have used the examples of missing bowling shirts turning up overnight on the back of the couch, or mysterious drippy stains on the carpet, or a missing twenty dollar bill that reappeared facing the other way, or a cracked glass in the curio cabinet, or sticky residue on the kitchen linoleum. All of which may or may not have occurred in my residence this summer.Apparently, I've been Ambiening myself all over the place, wreaking havoc and not remembering it. Or staging crime scenes for the fun of accusing others so I can put on my judge, jury, and executioner hats. Who knew I was so fond of chapeaus? Maybe these were acts of Chester Drawers, the resident basement entity. Or some maximum security prisoners tunneled out of the local lock-up to prank a gal in Backroads, just to hear her whine.I say that Responsibility should stop having so much class. Stop showing up on the doorstep with an engraved invitation and a dozen roses and a bottle of champagne with a real cork, asking for the pleasure of one's company.Responsibility needs to start biting people on the butt.

Shocked! That a regime of 44 oz. Diet Cokes and gas station chicken for an entire summer, coupled with sitting in a mostly cool basement, would not result in a stunning weight loss. Life just isn't fair sometimes, is it?But before you jump to a too-personal conclusion, I must add that the excess poundage was not discovered when I stepped on the scale that resides next to the refrigerator. Seriously. Why would I step on a scale? I'm not one to go looking for trouble. It finds me easily enough on its own.No, I found out that I gained two pounds when the heating and cooling man handed me a yellow bill. Not a yellow bill, like from a cute, downy, snow-white duck. That would be gruesome. I certainly would not allow such a man to service my air conditioner! Nor would I condone his actions! Ducks should not be separated from their quackers. Because then they don't need Chapstick, and even if they wanted some, they could not tell the merchant, \"Put it on my bill.\" Unless, of course, the merchant had ripped off the duck's bill himself. But why would he do that, when he could make more money repairing heat pumps?The yellow bill was a piece of paper showing that I owed $184 for freon. TWO POUNDS of freon. Because I haven't spent enough time sweating this summer without the use of my air conditioner due to power outages. Nope. Let the power flow, and let my AC unit run its fan for 24 hours nonstop pushing tepid air through the ductwork, requiring me to fire up the exhaust fan after outside temps dipped below inside temps, thus using up even more kilowatts to suck cooler humid air inside my abode while huffing the hot air up and out through the attic.Is there any snow in the forecast?"}, {"title": "Well, I Suppose THAT Idea has Already Been Taken", "date": "Tuesday, July 31, 2012", "text": "Yesterday, I finished reading Wild, by Cheryl Strayed. Read it over two days, in fact, and could have finished it in one day if I didn't fritter my time away with cooking, laundry, blogging, and driving to town for a 44 oz. Diet Coke. It's a tale of hiking the Pacific Coast Trail as a single woman with no previous hiking experience.It was a compelling page-turner. I know it's a memoir. But I could have done with more hiking and less backstory. Not that I am an experienced hiker. I used to walk a local trail in the state park every day. Just for fun and exercise. Not on a personal quest for inner peace. My trail was blacktopped. Bikers used it too, which was disconcerting at times. Just like Linda said today over at her blog. One minute, I was walking along, at peace with the world, and the next minute I'd hear a bellow of \"TRAIL!\" right behind me where a cushion of solitude had buffered me from the world's hustle and bustle. The only thing to do after hearing \"TRAIL!\" was jump off the side into the twigs and dead leaves. Quick. Because in the woods, nobody can hear your bones break. And it's going to take a while to get the message out that you are incapacitated, and then haul your broken body to a medical facility. By the same token, you want to be careful to watch your step. Slipping on an errant acorn could cause a sprained ankle that would hamper your two-mile hike back to the road. The bicyclists didn't ride it every day. Depending on the time I chose for my outing, I was often the only person on the trail.This was before I was married. Before I had kids that needed minding during my two-hour escape. Oh, it didn't take me that long to walk four miles. I chugged along at about 20 minutes per mile. But I had to get ready. And drive to the park. The whole trail is 11 miles long. I only walked the whole trail about once every three weeks. It was kind of an all-day affair. And I took a companion most times. Because it's kind of eerie to be a woman alone five miles into the woods when a biker rushes past you. You never know. This was in the dark ages, before cell phones.At least I never had to worry about getting lost. The trail was paved, for cryin' out loud! So I didn't have to wear hiking boots. My comfy, broken-in walking shoes were fine. I didn't carry a hefty backpack with all of my belongings. I didn't have to find a place to sleep and set up camp and cook a meal. I could shower and put on clean clothes when I finished. But still. Eleven miles is an accomplishment. Heck, even four miles is an accomplishment. I wish I could do that today.I admit that I have a vivid imagination. Sometimes, on my solo daily walks, I would wonder what might happen if the rustle I heard down in the holler was a fugitive camping out. What if some un-law-abidin' scalawag jumped from behind a tree trunk and waylaid me? Who would know? Nobody, until I failed to call my mom the next morning. Because it was summertime. The living was easy. Teachers across the nation recharging their batteries in unemployed bliss.The trail had a lower trail-head and an upper trail-head. The whole thing was a loop. At the deepest point in, I was only four miles from a blacktop road. I could choose to go either way at either end. Four different courses. The distance was painted on the blacktop every mile, if you looked close enough. My route varied, and depended on whether I wanted to start out level, or uphill, or downhill, or with the best panorama. Wildlife abounded. My biggest animal fear was skunk. I smelled them on occasion, but never was the reason for the spraying. Next came dogs. Best not to look them in the eye. Keep walking at a steady pace. I was ready to shout NO and BAD DOG if one came at me. Because any dog in there was most likely an escaped pet from the campground, and would have had people experience.The scariest incident related to my trail-walking was the time I disregarded the seasons. It was fall, and school had started up again. I had agreed to keep the scorebook for boys' basketball games. We had a Friday off school, and I figured I had time to squeeze in a trail walk and get cleaned up in time to show up at the gym. The weather was perfect, just a little chill in the air. I had not been walking in the park for a while, but instead had walked in town. At my two-mile turnaround point, darkness began to creep into the woods. Sunset comes at a different time when you are in the middle of the forest. It was stressful. I knew I was on the trail. But light was leaving me. Every crunched leaf was a hillbilly ax murderer following me, biding his time. My breathing grew labored. My muscles tensed. I felt like I was striding two steps forward and three steps back. With a half-mile left, the woods faded farther from the trail. It was a little clearing of sorts. With just a short stretch of trees left at the edge of the road. I was never so glad to end a walk in my life.I can't imagine walking hundreds of miles along the Pacific Coast Trail. Alone. But I can imagine writing about it."}, {"title": "Be Careful Not to Bite Off More", "date": "Monday, July 30, 2012", "text": "Pardon me. I am almost too pooped to post. Worn out. Weak. Limp as a noodle. Shaky as Jello.The reason for my malaise is my supper. Last night I cooked up a delicious roast. Full of onions, baby carrots, and Klondike Rose potatoes. Mmm...steeped in a tasty pot liquor of meat juices, Worcestershire sauce, steak sauce, and powdered Hidden Valley ranch mix. The boys eat it up. Because I live in a house full of carnivorous menfolk, running out of meat is not an option. So I always cook two roasts. We eat on it for several meals.Save A Lot is my store of choice for meat. They have their own butcher. They don't add water to their products in order to charge you for nothing. The taste is fantastic. And there is not a Product of Canada sticker on the package. Not that there's anything wrong with Canada. I don't go in for fancy high-end cuts. A rump roast or an arm roast is okay with my live-in beef-eaters. All were pleased as punch with their sumptuous repast.Tonight, I warmed the remains slowly in the oven. I carved off a hunk for The Pony. Sliced it into bite-sized pieces for him, because I baby him. Filled his plate with carrots and potatoes, no onions. He added ketchup and two biscuits. And pronounced it good. Genius was away at a friend's house, having snuck out without taking the trash dumpster to the end of the driveway for tomorrow morning's pickup. Hick was called back to work by the security company within thirty minutes of his home arrival. So I hacked off a hunk of roast, dredged up some tasty onions, carrots, and potatoes, and settled down to sup.Au contraire. I can barely type, what with the cramp in my right elbow from sawing at that fibrous flesh like a madwoman. I now have a forearm like Popeye. My jaws are too weak to chew warm butter. I need to chew it, you know, because according to many, it won't melt in my mouth. My roast could serve as a training table item for competitive eaters. I'm surprised I have not come down with TMJ.I declare! That roast could not have come from a run-of-the-mill, everyday steer. No way, Jose! That's a fact, Jack! The way those muscle fibers wove and twisted, I'm suspecting my roast beast was actually a cut from the abdominal muscles of a Tasmanian Devil. Not the actual bad-natured but cute-looking real animal. The cartoon, spinning, twisting, tornado-shaped Tasmanian Devil.Food Network chef Robert Irvine, with his phenomenal biceps and knowledge of tenderizing techniques, could not have made my cut palatable. It could have been wedged under the saddle of Attila the Hun, and ridden, at a trot, across eastern AND western Europe, and still not been made chewable by any human, even one in possession of the entire Osmond family's teeth and Jay Leno's jaw. The more I chewed, the bigger each bite of meat grew. I could have marketed it as beef-flavored gum. Like a Willie Wonka product. Not because it was three courses. But because it was never-ending. Like an Everlasting Gobstopper. Only gum.Because hope springs eternal in the Val Thevictorian breast, I kept trying. Again. And again. Don't think I was swallowing that chunk whole. I'm a lady, dagnabbit! I spit it out. Nobody was there to see me. No need to be polite and hawk it into a cloth napkin. I had a little bowl that I'd put my biscuit in to protect it from the pot liquor. So it served as a rejected meat receptacle.Funny how when I finished eating, I had a bowl full of meat.

In fact, I think it's hereditary. My paternal grandmother suffered from the same ailment. Of the immediate family, only The Pony has inherited the disorder.I have piles. Caused by my bookarrhea. Hick tried to cure me, or at least relieve some symptoms. When he started finishing the full basement, he built shelves into my office. One whole wall. Ten feet. Four tall bookcases, floor to ceiling. Seven shelves per case. He added two more shelves on two other walls. I have four more tall bookcases scattered throughout the basement. And another one that is chest high. All full.Some favorites have a home forever. I will not part with them. Others are unread. So they have a reprieve. The books I have read and am ready to release are filling up the house. Oh, I try. I packed up many boxes, and told Hick that he was welcome to take them to the auction. Set up a flea market booth. Do what was necessary. His action? He put them ALL on a tall bookcase in his workshop. Really? REALLY? I sorted and packed and set them on the counter by the door...and he unpacked them.I donated several boxes of paperbacks to the local library. They put donations on a shelf up front. Sometimes more in a side room. And sell them for twenty-five cents. A dollar for hardbacks. Of course, on the day we dropped off my overflow, the library was having a sale. Ten cents. Genius picked up ten books. And I picked up ten books. How could we not? TWO DOLLARS FOR TWENTY BOOKS!One of my work friends always donates her books to her church charity organization as soon as she finishes reading them. Except for John Grisham. Her husband allows her to keep a collection of Grishams. But everything else must go.I've tried offering my books to Genius. He could set up an eBay account. Or Amazon Sellers. Make a good piece of change. But he says it's too much of a hassle. Hick says the auction is a waste of time. People might bid to get one book out of a box. Or the whole box will go for one dollar. No doubt for the buyer to make a killing selling those books online. I've even thought of asking if I can take a box to school, to the teacher workroom, and sell them for a couple bucks apiece. These are hardbacks. Like new. I know I could give them away at work. But selling might be frowned upon. I've thought of giving them away through my blog, but that is entirely too much work, what with garnering addresses, and hauling them to the dead-mouse-smelling post office, and paying to ship them.My last resort is to look up that Amazon buy-back program.

Woke The Pony, who was happy to accompany me instead of letting the goats out to graze on charred grass for an hour. Listened to Hick's litany of Things I Would Like To Throw Away Money On This Week. Forked over gas money to Genius. And got in the shower.Twenty minutes later, post shower, I was standing at the bathroom sink, parting my lovely tresses, which, regardless of the beliefs of Hick, do NOT fall into place after years of proper training, when I was startled by a loud, booming voice. I will admit that I am a naturally jumpy person. Don't sneak up on me and tap me on the shoulder. Don't glide silently across the room like a movie Dracula until you're standing right beside me. For cryin' out loud, put a box of Tic Tacs in your pocket so I can hear you coming. I am constantly chastising Genius and Hick for sidling into my dark basement lair and speaking from the office doorway behind me when my attention is on my computer monitor. I have been trying for years to break my boys of their habit of leaning their cherubic faces within inches of mine, and then shouting, \"MOM!\" to wake me from a recliner nap. I'm a bit high-strung. I admit it.You might be amused to see me jump higher than a springbok when you scare me. Perhaps you wish for me to topple to the ground like a fainting goat. Maybe that's why people laugh after one of my spooking episodes, when I implore them, \"Will somebody please restart my heart?\"Yes, I have a nervous nature. And odd things happen around here.

The voice indeed had a body. The body of Genius, shouting his addition to the grocery list through the bathroom door, heedless of my need for gradual intrusion on my moment of solitude. Not only did he scare a year's worth of sandwich-making out of me, he forgot to bring in the tomatoes after church, and they blanched themselves in the sun for five hours inside his truck inside the ZipLoc back my mother had so thoughtfully packed them in.

Was already smacking his lips over a plate of his yard-bird eggs and sausage. But then I got home, and made him go door to door to find out who the pigs belonged to. And made him release them from the BARn, and give them back.This morning he declared he was going to buy a prefabricated barn building, and park his 1980 Olds Toronado under one lean-to, and the four-wheelers and hay bales under the other. Or maybe he'd just build a carport onto the side of our existing garage. Or extend his BARn lean-to area on each side. Or have some matching trusses made, and come out thirty feet from the front of the BARn. Or buy a portable carport roof thingy. Or build a 30' x 50' shed.I am exhausted.Hick says the real reason is because his Toronado does not need to be sitting out in the elements. I pointed out that he has an entire BARn in which to park that baby. But no. The BARn is full of truck. His collector truck. Which has been without its bed for nigh on thirteen years, what with him \"fixing it up\" to enter in car shows. Which has never quite seemed to happen. He says it's because I won't release the purse strings so he can buy parts. I say it's because he has jumped from one to another of about thirty different projects in that time. Most of which have eaten away at his allowance bite by bite.I'll give it a week. I DID talk him out of building that indoor gym with regulation basketball court that he was dead set on five years ago. It's not that I begrudge him his animals and outbuildings and riding toys.I need something more concrete than the skeletal plans he has proposed."}, {"title": "A Series of Unsettling Events", "date": "Friday, July 20, 2012", "text": "...continued from \"Introducing...Chester\"When we last convened, I was mid-tale in my account of Chester Drawers, a second-hand piece of furniture that I blame for some odd occurrences in my home. Because he's so photogenic, I'm posting another pic of our dear Chester.Hick unceremoniously carted Chester off to the basement to free up some space in the room of Toddler Genius. The basement is not some dark hidey hole for spiders and boxes of Christmas decorations and an occasional game of cat-and-mouse between Jame Gumb and Clarice Starling. It's a functioning part of our abode, running the length and breadth of the House That Hick Built, containing a TV/game room with a pool table, pinball machine, air hockey table, piano, electric fireplace, bookshelves, and of course, my recliner. Other rooms in this subterranean paradise include my dark lair office space, the NASCAR bathroom, a giant workshop, and Hick's treasure room. The basement is accessed by walking through the floor of our living room. That means that it is not sealed off with a door, but has stairs descending through a large rectangle surrounded by sturdy wooden railing.I stuffed Chester full of off-season clothing, and he sat unmolested on his squatty legs until a snowfall, or the harbingers of spring appeared. Basements are known for their cool temperature. So I can't speak as to whether Chester dropped the digits upon his relocation. I had not even made a connection yet between Chester and the odd happenings in the room of Toddler Genius.Shortly after Chester's move, we began to have issues with a specific light bulb in the basement. Hick is not one to thoroughly finish all projects. To this day, we have a bulb that is simply screwed into the socket on the ceiling. No fancy fixture on that one. Even though other lights have them, and the pool table has a Tiffany style stained-glass-looking rectangle enclosing its overhanging bulbs. This problem bulb hangs over my big-screen TV and recliner part of the room.One evening, the light bulb went out. I told Hick he needed to replace it, that we had blown a bulb. Two days later, I was still waiting, using my plier-lamp (another story entirely) for illumination. And that bulb came back on! I told Hick to forget the replacement that he had already forgotten. \"How can it be blown and come back on?\" He thought I was crazy. A few days later, the bulb went out again. Hick put in a new one. \"Must be a bad bulb.\" The new one lasted about a day, then started the same tricks. On for a while. Off a few hours. On. Off a few days. On. Hick put in a third bulb. It shined for a week. And then...Around 11:30 p.m., I finished watching TV and started for the steps, to ascend to the upper level and my boudoir. You know how you get a creepy feeling that something isn't right? I had one. I thought, \"Don't you dare go out now, you stupid light.\" AND IT DID! It went right out the moment I finished that thought. The hair on the nape of my neck stood up. I ran up those thirteen steps and turned off the basement light switch. The next morning, the bulb came on as normal. And stayed on. I suppose I had been shown who was boss.Hick installed an electric fireplace in the corner of the basement TV room to guard against the chill. Normal basement chill, I presumed. He could never enforce his Socks or Slippers Policy on the boys, who enjoyed barefootin' all over the house. And I refused to let him drill through the concrete foundation and put in a flue for a wood or gas fireplace. So electric it was. A pretty little corner fixture with a mantle and glass doors and fake light flames and a blower. Genius, the budding photographer, took a picture of it a few days after installation. The fireplace was turned off at the time. He showed me the photo on his digital camera.\"What's that?\" There was a purple sphere of light in the fireplace, floating between the fake logs and the glass.\"I don't know. It wasn't there in the preview.\"\"It must be a reflection.\"\"Mom. I had the flash turned off.\"Surely it was a spec of dust. A purple spec of dust. Yeah. That had to be the explanation. Genius lost that picture when his computer crashed, or I would post it.And now, for the grand finale...wait a minute. This is getting very long. Perhaps we should wait another day. What's that? You'd rather just get it over with, like ripping off the BandAid, chugging down the medicine, yanking out a baby tooth with a string tied to a doorknob? Okay. If you insist.I saw a man in the basement. Not an intruder. Not flesh-and-blood. Not with all his body parts. What some might term an apparition, I suppose.Chester had been moved, from the wall nearest that recalcitrant light bulb and the fake fireplace, to his position in that picture, which is at the bottom of the stairs. On the other side of the stairs is the big-screen TV and the end table which holds the satellite receiver. I like to watch TV without the overhead lights. I have a lamp. It's cozy. The only problem back then was that the main light switch was at the top of the stairs. So once I turned off my lamp, I had to cross the room in the dark, with only the glow of the TV upstairs to guide me. It was enough light to see the outlines of the furniture, and where the steps started.On this particular night, I turned off the TV. Turned off my lamp. And started the eight strides to the bottom of the stairs. At about stride four, just before the end table, A MAN APPEARED IN FRONT OF ME! Not directly, but in the two o'clock position. I was startled. I sidestepped to the left in order to avoid running into him. He was shorter than me, and had no head. He was wearing an old-time kind of black suit, with a white shirt with an old-time kind of collar that stuck up and didn't flap over. There were black buttons down the white shirt. No tie. He looked solid, not see-through. He didn't move or say anything. After about three seconds, he faded away.I ran up those stairs faster than an Olympic stair-running gold medalist. I turned off the upstairs TV and hopped in bed next to Hick. I knew his snores would protect me. I woke him and explained my close encounter. He thought I was crazy. The next morning, I harped for him to put a light switch in the basement. He humored me. To this day, I have never turned off the lamp and TV without first turning on the overhead lights. I have flashlights stashed near all my sitting places, just in case of a power outage.Chester has been relocated once again, to the outer wall, under The Pony's room. Have I mentioned that I hear walking upstairs in The Pony's room? The last being on Tuesday night. When The Pony spent the night at his grandma's house."}, {"title": "Introducing...Chester", "date": "Thursday, July 19, 2012", "text": "Blog buddy Stephen had an interesting encounter with an armoire. Which of course reminded me of a curious piece of furniture of my own. Because everything is all about me, remember?Shortly after moving into the House That Hick Built, we saw a need for a chest of drawers for Genius. He was about to turn three, and we decided that he was due for an upgrade of sorts from his baby furniture to something more mature. Besides, The Pony would make his grand entrance in three months, and would take over the baby furniture. Rather than invest in a matching bedroom set from a reputable furniture store, Hick decided that the toddler bed was fine for a while, and Genius merely needed some drawers for his clothing.Hick never met a thrift store he didn't like. He had a string of establishments from Backroads to St. Louis that he frequented when he was in the neighborhood. He told me of a chest of drawers that he had spotted in Festus, down the street from the post office. One Saturday, we packed up our Ford Aerostar with toddler Genius, and headed north.The store was filled with items that you might imagine in the attic of your elderly aunt. A dressmaker's dummy. Odd lamps. Musty chairs that may or may not have been upholstered in horsehide (hide your eyes, in utero Pony). Assorted ottomans. Busts of curly-haired men. Oval mirrors in wooden stands. Sideboards. A roll-top desk. Ornate magazine racks. I'll stop short of comparing it to an antique shop that might have been run by Barlow and Straker in 'Salem's Lot. But it definitely had an atmosphere.Hick led me to the chest of drawers. It wasn't exactly children's furniture. But I could see a use for it. Hick bartered his way to an acceptable price and agreed to pick it up one day after work the next week.The photo does not do justice to the wavy curvature of the drawers, but this is the actual chest. Not in the bedroom of toddler Genius, but in a later resting place, the basement of The House That Hick Built, which also acts as a sort of game room. But I'm getting ahead of myself.Because this piece of furniture seemed to have a personality of its own, I am going to call him Chester. Chester Drawers. He is composed of real wood. Not fiberboard. Not a veneer glued over plywood. The drawers are solid. Dovetailed, not nailed. If you pull out a drawer and look down on that curvy front edge, you can see three distinct layers that have been bent and pressed together. The front piece is about a half-inch thick, and the other two a quarter-inch each. I have no idea what kind of wood it is. Farmer H is gone to an auction at the moment, so I am lacking a consultant.Toddler Genius paid no mind to Chester. What kid would? It's furniture. I heard him talking in his room one day. I hollered from the kitchen, \"Who you talking to?\"\"Oh, just Tony. That little boy I play with sometimes.\" I tried to act like that was perfectly normal. But the hair on the back of my neck stood up. Genius went back to his room and resumed playing.I thought that maybe he just had an imaginary friend. At supper that night, I said, \"How about some for Tony?\"Toddler Genius fixed me with a withering stare. \"He's not HERE!\" Like I was the crazy one. Seeing people who were not there. He never talked about Tony. Only to him. And only in his room. A few weeks later, he came out talking about George Henson.\"Who do you mean, George Henson? I don't know anybody with that name.\"\"You know, Mom. That bad guy that burned up all those people in that hotel.\"\"No, honey. I don't know about that.\" But you can bet I was going to find out. I asked around. Old people, the internet of the day. And since then, I've Googled and Googled. But I never found anything in the town history about George Henson, or a tragic hotel fire. At least with Tony, I had assumed he picked a familiar name, from the carpenter who framed our house, and had done work on the old house as well.Toddler Genius refused to sleep in his room. I didn't put much stock in this. He had done the same thing at the old house, before Chester joined the family. I had hoped that he would like to sleep in his new room. Which was always cold. We moved in November. I asked Hick to adjust the vents, to get more heat to the bedroom of Genius, and less to some that didn't matter. Hick did. But that bedroom stayed cold. Even in summer, facing west, a double window letting in the heat. It was like the furnace couldn't heat it, but the air conditioner cooled it better. Again, Hick adjusted vents. But that room stayed at least five degrees colder than the rest of the house. Year round. Until we got Genius a little boy bed, and Hick rearranged the room, and decided that Chester Drawers did not fit.We moved Chester to the basement, and the bedroom temperature became the same as the rest of the house. However...some funny things started to happen in the basement.To be continued on Friday..."}, {"title": "All I Really Need to Know About Blogging I Learned From Stuart Smalley", "date": "Wednesday, July 18, 2012", "text": "The summer is winding down, and Genius is in full annoyance mode. He lay abed until midday, then slithered from his room with mayhem in mind. He's a tricky one. At first, he tried to wheedle me into make him french toast, even though we have frozen french toast sticks that merely require deposition into a toaster two feet from the freezer. Next on the agenda, a political debate for which he was sadly unarmed, not even grasping the bare bones basics of Bill Clinton's infamous non-inhalation. After burying his head under a couch pillow, Genius re-emerged to swat my hand away from my own laptop, and forced me to read a site of his choosing.Hyperbole and a Half -TexasNot that there's anything wrong with that. It's a perfectly good website, with this perfectly good post about a calamity involving Texas and a championship race. A laugh and a half. My cup of tea, if I was a tea drinker. Which I'm not. But I got some snickers out of it. My objection was to the pictures, which took an inordinate amount of time to load on my fibromyalgic-hamster-operated internet connection. So I had to question his choice.\u00a0This takes too long to load. Why so many pictures? It's fine without them. And you'd think they would be better pictures.Mom! That's what Allie does.

It's in Paint, Mom.\u00a0Well, how come that dog looks like a real dog. but her people look like fish?They just do. Somebody asked what's that on her head, and she said you could think of it like a shark fin.\u00a0I'M funny. And I don't have pictures. Hers would be fine with a line of empty space between paragraphs. Like mine. I'm being published, you know.So is she, but in her OWN BOOK.\u00a0Maybe SHE doesn't have a husband and two kids who expect her to make sandwiches three times a day, so she has TIME to get her book published.She has an annoying boyfriend.\u00a0Don't you think I'm funny?You're funny. The ones about me.\u00a0I'm good enough. I'm smart enough. And doggone it, people laugh at me!Allie has millions of readers.I have readers! But I lost all my followers when I switched to a new template. Is there any way to get them back?Nope.\u00a0Have you even seen it? Look.That's ugly.\u00a0No it isn't!Let's read about me.\u00a0Here, you'll have to go to the old one.Hey! How'd you get that many pageviews? That's twenty thousand. Okay. It's really only nineteen thousand thee hundred thirty-three.\u00a0That's for a whole year. How many did you think I had?I don't know. A couple hundred, maybe. But let's see. If you only had one, that would be almost four hundred in a year. So that really isn't very many.\u00a0Thanks. It's not millions. But I don't know how to draw bad pictures in Paint. Besides, I loaded that page and read that whole Texas story, and then there wasn't an ending.There was an ending.\u00a0I only have nineteen thousand three hundred thirty-three pageviews, but I know that story needs a better ending.Ahhh! I can't take this anymore!\u00a0Sure. Cover your head with a couch pillow. That reminds me of this really good movie I saw a couple days ago. Okay, not a good movie, but I read the book, and it was good. It's called Native Son. By Richard Wright. I had a class and it was one of our assigned books. It's better than the movie with fat Oprah. Not thin Oprah. Here's what happens...I told Genius the basic plot of the story, part of which involves a pillow over a head. He even removed his couch pillow. And looked at me. Intensely. Hanging onto every word. Because I CAN tell a story. Even if it's not my own. Even if it's acted by fat Oprah. I glossed over some of the final parts, just for brevity's sake. Because we all know that in the dictionary, beside the word brevity, is a picture of me. Then I jumped to the end. Genius frowned.That's IT?\u00a0Yeah. What do you mean? You were hanging onto every word.I was just trying to be polite.\u00a0Uh huh. Because you're always polite to me.That's a terrible ending!\u00a0Exactly. That's my payback for spending so much time reading that Texas story.

And those who are not, please weigh in with your opinion. Oops! Didn't mean to scare you off with that WEIGH IN part.As you recall, due to me harping on it for two days, I was notified by e-mail on July 4 that Unsent Letters wants to publish one of my sent letters. After a day or two, I replied to the e-mail that, indeed, I would accept their offer.Here's the question: Was that the right way to respond?Should I have sent a separate e-mail, perhaps? One with publication offer and the name of my letter in the subject line? Or was the reply to the offer good enough?The reason I'm asking is twofold. First of all, I'm not a patient person. I'm the Cup-O-Soup, not the slowly-simmered clam chowder. The Easy Mac, not the twice-baked macaroni and cheese. The Buddig turkey lunch meat on Wonder, not the thawed and roasted Thanksgiving bird baked to a delicate brown, sliced and layered on a made-from-scratch croissant. Even though I know that the business of publication moves slower that a septuagenarian snail across a sea of molasses, I kind of sort of expected I might have heard something back. Even though it took eleven months from my submission to their offer. I don't want my reply to languish in a backlog of e-mail compost, fermenting, until it digests itself.Secondly, I don't want to violate any unwritten protocols. Like engaging in sexual intercourse with the cleaning woman on the desk in my office, then gifting her with a cashmere sweater with a red dot. Or dropping off muffin stumps to the homeless shelter, thus drawing the ire of Rebecca DeMornay. Or mentioning that I did not get bread with my soup.Sooo...is that frowned upon? To simply reply to the e-mail offer? Or is that the way it's done?My inquiring mind wants to know."}, {"title": "Crafty Son of a Gun, the Series", "date": "Monday, July 16, 2012", "text": "By popular, or at least duo demand, I present...the BARn that Hick Built.

But around these parts, we live in the past, and seldom update our picture library. If you look closely, you will see what Jeff Foxworthy refers to as the working TV on top of the nonworking TV.

Take, for instance, his thoughtful purchase at last night's auction. Not for himself, of course. He bought himself a duck. A ceramic, bowl-shaped, lidded, jewelry-holder type of duck. Made in Italy! Or so Picker Hick proclaimed. I have no photo, because after traipsing into the house this morning to show it to me, in a manner that would have done Carol Merrill proud, she of the Monty Hall Let's Make a Deal spokesmodel era, even though she did not speak, Picker Hick hopped into his Gator (excuse me for calling it a Mule in previous posts--The Pony has now set me straight on the John Deere brand), much to the delight of the muttly trio, (who roused themselves to yip and yap and run circles around Picker Hick while waiting for him to put it in gear), and whisked it off to his cabin or BARn for suitable display amongst his other treasures.Yeah. I'm practicing to enter the Guinness Book of Longest Run-On Sentences contest.Picker Hick often buys items for The Pony. Not because he's a loving father who enjoys showering his youngest son with other people's cast-offs as gifts. But because he's got the fever. The buying fever. And he knows that he can get that rush from bidding and purchasing, and then get reimbursed from the First National Bank of The Pony. Insured by the VTIC (Val Thevictorian Insurance Corporation). Most often, these gifts fall into the category of random collector swords that single men had to give up when the new wife put her foot down. But Saturday night's Pony purchase was a book. That's right! You heard it here first. No need to catch it on the 11:00 news.Picker Hick bought The Pony a book!Not just any book. Something The Pony is actually interested in. Which is a double miracle, what with Picker Hick being the man who, upon moving my belongings into the House That Hick Built, arranged random tomes on the living room bookshelf based on LOOKS. He put the prettiest books on display. No matter whether it was Stephen King's unabridged The Stand, or a freshman year textbook for Composition and Rhetoric. Which appeared in my possession mysteriously, since I tested out of that class and obtained three hours of college credit on my transcript for free.Not only did Picker Hick buy The Pony a book pertinent to his tastes...he got it for a song! No, Picker Hick did not actually have to warble a tune, most likely The Oak Ridge Boys' classic, Elvira, to obtain this book. He paid the low down rock bottom price of FOUR DOLLARS. And look at it:The Pony's photo from my phone does not do it justice. That's his phone on top of it, to show the scale. This is a grand hardback coffee table book of archaeology. With glossy color photos inside. Just the ticket for a lad who has a love for ancient Greek and Roman history. And owns his very own Indiana Jones fedora and whip.Kudos to Picker Hick.

You can check in any time you like, but you can never leave. That's kind of hard for me to accomplish on my own right now, what with two single posts showing. But before I crossed over, I had 499 posts, people! Four hundred ninety-nine posts! Since February, 2011. Somebody really needs to find a better use for her idle time, huh?Alas, poor Snuggles. She is with me in spirit only. Oh, don't y'all worry your pretty little heads none about scrappy prickly Snuggles. She isn't dead. She forsook me for the neighbors. Not the neighbors with the dog that killed our chicken. The ones next door to them. She used to wander over there, and they fed her, and they let her in their house. They're kind of like the roach motel and Hotel California of neighbors. Because even though Snuggles was not allowed inside our house, I never knew her to be a wizard with doorknobs. So maybe she is plotting an escape, but has not yet had an opportunity to return. It's not like she wears pants to conceal bags of dirt from her tunnel that she can dump and scuff into the soil of her prison yard. And even if she could craft a papier mache head to fool the guards, there's no current for her to ride back home on a raincoat raft. Something tells me that she's not asking for a Raquel Welch poster and a rock hammer, either.I miss my kindred catty spirit. But I don't worry about her. I know she's livin' it up with two recluses who don't drive, and only go to town when they call a taxi. Which is not exactly a yellow cab out here in Backroads, but more of a Dodge Caravan with a magnetic sign on the door. Snuggles might even be chowing down on Fancy Feast every evening, with a white tablecloth and candlelight.I'm counting on that picture to strike fear into your mouse-clicking fingertips. Sit a spell. Take your Crocs off."}, {"title": "Under Construction: The New CatHouse", "date": "Tuesday, July 10, 2012", "text": "Hallooooo! I'm switching over to a cleaner slate. All the old stuff is still here. All 500 posts worth! But now it's under a new address: unbaggingthecatsone.blogspot.comClever, huh? I'm so creative with names and such. So if you have a hankerin' to delve into the past, read some comment responses, chart the progress of my madness from this blog's inception...that's where to go. It will take me a few days to get my blogroll updated. So bear with me. I'd have put up some cones and bright orange signs warning of the rough patch, but folks here in Backroads have a habit of absconding with such loot.The only issue in my relocation seems to be that my followers have disappeared! I've given you the slip. Slogged through the creek to throw off the scent. Darted around a corner and waited for you to run by. Cut the lights and coasted behind a copse of lilacs. Brushed out my tracks with a weeping willow branch. So if it's not too much trouble, and you actually pop in here to visit on occasion, could you please re-follow? \"Don't cost nothin',\" says Bluto Blutarsky.Nothing else is changing. It will be business as usual. Val whining about the multitude of ways in which the world conspires against her. And every now and then, perhaps, a success story about a Val story. Keep your fingers crossed on that one.Ahh. Smell that? No! It's not the road skunk/dead mouse odor from yesterday's mistreatment of Val at the hands of the postmistress. It's that new-blog smell! Or maybe that's just the formaldehyde outgassing after I unrolled this new blog. Watch your step. I still have those cardboard runners down for the high-traffic areas.This move has been surprisingly simple. All my utilities transferred over. Now I just need to hang the artwork and unload the moving van full of sidebar. I might just throw myself a blogwarming party when I get everything squared away.Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to lock up. I'm dashing off to lay in a supply of Doan's Pills. You know. Just in case I throw out my back with the heavy lifting."}]
