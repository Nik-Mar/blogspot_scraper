Our educator Elizabeth Bird got things rolling by having us discuss our own memories of toys and play. It was remarkable how similar our experiences were. Mostly we remembered playing outside, relatively unsupervised, with few if any toys. And most of the toys people did mention tended to be those either of their own creation, or of the bicycle, crayon, blocks, dolls, and balls variety, open-ended play stuff that lent itself to physical, intellectual, and creative exploration.", "\n", "\n", "Of course, scientists tell us that most adults have very few reliable memories that come from those years before 5 \u2013 the core preschool years \u2013 so I\u2019m assuming that most of these memories are of somewhat older children.

As a ", "cooperative preschool", " a parent is responsible for supervising each of these station, and I urge them to think of themselves as a suburban or rural mom standing in the kitchen window keeping an eye on the kids who happen to be playing in her backyard. Ideally, her role is simply to keep the children safe, to make sure they\u2019re not mistreating each other, and to help only when help is obviously needed. Otherwise, the job is to stand back and let the children experiment with one another and the stuff they find there.", "\n", "\n", "One of the ways that I differ, it seems, from my fellow Woodland Park adults is that I have very clear memories of my childhood toys, many of which have since been banned by various regulatory agencies. There were, of course, the infamous Jarts (lawn darts). And I have many fond memories of lighting off firecrackers and bottle rockets. SST\u2019s were a kind of racecar that used a rip cord to get its large center wheel spinning at such high speeds that the vehicle, once released, could put a hole in dry wall and raise nasty welts on shins. We didn\u2019t have many battery-powered toys, instead they had to be plugged into wall sockets. I had a wood-burning set, and several \u201ctoy\u201d heating elements that got hot enough to melt plastics that we then poured into molds and cooled in water. My friend even had a set that allowed us to melt down hunks of lead that we then used to make toy soldiers.

Let the children fill up that dead air. It sometimes takes awhile, especially for boys, to find words. It's during this time that children will often spontaneously \"apologize\" by returning the taken item or attempting to hug their crying friend. This is a genuine 2-year-old apology. If it happens, you're done, but it\u2019s rare so don't count on it. Take this time to read their facial and body language -- it's usually very easy with 2-year-olds. If the \"victim\" is ready to move on, let 'em roam. This child has learned an important lesson: life is not fair, but there is often justice. (Remember, there are times we teach from facts and times we teach from intention.) Sometimes the offender is moved to tears -- another version of a genuine 2-year-old apology.", "7) Respond to whatever the offender says (even if they are trying to change the subject) by repeating what you know to be true and by drawing the connection between cause and effect. If the child clearly isn't paying attention, command that attention by asking clear yes-or-no questions (e.g., \"Do you like to be hit?\" \"Are you going to hit your friends?\" \"Are you going to take things from your friends?\"). Two-year-olds tend to be pretty honest. If they say they will not hit their friends then consider it a lesson learned even if it only \"takes\" for a few minutes. If they say \"Yes\" they will hit their friends (and I've had many children admit to this), then tell them, \"Then I'll have to hold you.\" After a few minutes ask the question again and repeat until you finally get a \"no\".", "8) For me, that's the end of it, but there are many who don't consider the process complete without a formal apology. I won't go into why I'm not a fan of the artificial adult-sponsored \"I'm sorry.\" An apology that is offered merely out of social convention, rather than out of genuine remorse, just doesn't sit well with me. Besides, I've watched too many conflicts between children get diverted into a conflict between parent and child as the former insists on the word \"sorry\" and the child refuses.
